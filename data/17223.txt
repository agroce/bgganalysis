RATING: 7
Similar to Runebound, but better. The XP track and turn counter provide a more tangible endpoint; in Runebound it was easy to forget why you were running around the map. The quest system gives each team intermediate goals. Character sheets and monster minis are a nice addition. Combat system is clever though eventually a little tedious. I have yet to come across any major rules questions or weird situations (unlike with Descent). 

EDIT: If you don't play regularly, setup will take forever. Didn't have as much fun with this last time. Rating changed from 9 to 7. This is the one FFG game I would say is truly overproduced.

Play this game when you have time to spare.  The game takes some time for newbies to learn and while the mechanics are simple they can be time consuming.

Fun and furious team game.

RATING: 7
Excellent production values.  Even the cardboard bits are thicker and more textured than your average game.  Gameplay is solid, but takes a very long time to play.  It seems that there would be some dead time with 6 players when it's not your turn.  Class balance is an issue, but expansions should smooth things out.

bought this for just 17 EUR ... that is quite a bargain I guess. I like how they transformed all the skills from the pc game to the simple battlemechanics but it is not much player interaction or strategy involved during battles (but of course there are many ways to build your character). It just takes too long for what it is.

Found it on Trademe for $90NZ - a damn fine price.  Managed to get a couple of games in in the weekend.  The first was about an hour long - the Alliance capitulated to the victorious Horde (me) to save themselves a thrashing.  The second game was longer, I had to leave about halfway through to paint, but I had joined the Alliance by now, and we were firmly in the lead.  

The game is similar to Runebound but has a much better combat system and being a co-op/team game it actually feels like you're playing with others, rather than by yourself.  I like the monster figures, except that Worgens and Gnolls look too alike.

RATING: 4
Many different items, lots of cards, different characters and the box is HUGE and full of material + you got the expansions with even more material but nevertheless this game feels more like playing solo. There is nearly no interaction between the players and fights against creeps become useless in later stages because you got so many power-ups that they cant even touch you. Because of the lack of interaction this game doesnt feel like playing a boardgame. Even though I love the Warcraft universe, I played this game only 3 times and there are several more games which get chosen to be played before playing this one again. Very disappointed

The battle system is unlike anythink I've ever seen before and the designer surely made a good job with that part. The design and quality of the game parts is also terrific. However, the game is a bit boring in the sense that it's always the same thing over and over again. I think this game idea would suit a game with shorter playing time better. If you haven't played the computer game I don't think you'll like this one very much.

RATING: 6.3
Like many people I played my fair share of war crack. Enough to buy the game, unfortunately like games based of film, board games based off computer games are rarely worth investing the time in. That said, apart from the time involved this was pretty good, and i actually want to give it another play in the future (and my main play group is getting more long game lots of bits friendly). The combat is actually quite clever and the guys put some obvious thought into it, not entirely sure about some of their other choices... but all in all good. A better choice of game spin off than some. I did buy another set of 21 combat dice to help speed up play (this was a good thing). Contains many things including 468 cards, 432 counters, and 136 miniatures.

RATING: 3
Ugh. So long and the game is usually decided within the first hour. Then the losing team has to Grundy through another three hours before the other team is strain enough to win. I do really like the hero building, however. So many different options that are all very different.

After the last couple of games my opinion changed significantly, dropping my rating from an 8 to a 3. Here are my old comments.

This is very long but enjoyable. It's much better than Runebound, Return of the Heroes, Dungeoneer and Talisman, but not as good as Descent. The luck level is also lower than most of those games due to the massive number of dice being rolled.

Hopefully this will get faster with practice.

You need a HUGE table to play this game.

Agreed it is not the best fantasy game out there.

Beautiful miniatures and a very interesting battle dice system that is very refreshing. 

Spells and items with upgrades are really quite cool. Good game but hard to table it too often.

RATING: 8
A quite extraordinarily good game. When we played it we had almost no downtime whatsoever because of planning ahead and most of the time your characters were already in the region to initiate combat in the next turn. Everything runs smoothly and the rules are clear and very easy to remember. Great combat system!! Thumbs up.

RATING: 6.8
Ok, I've played this game several times now with a variety of people.  My ranking has improved, although not vastly.  

The quests continue to feel identical and interchangeable but for rewards. Flavor text notwithstanding, there is nothing to differentiate this gnoll from the last. It's a gnoll with your quest marker on it. What the 'quest' is, is largely irrelevant.

Combat flows much more easily than it appears to on first glance and character abilities stack in fun and exciting ways. However, the lack of interaction between factions lowers the score. PVP combat never feels worthwhile, despite wars and bounties. The threat of it works well, but is limited. While understanding that WoW is at heart a racing game, I prefer more direct player conflict in my games.

Great execution of theme. This game started out as a hit among my group but we've played it less and less as time's gone on, mostly due to time constraints and downtime between player turns.

RATING: 1.5
Plays like a loooooong two player solitaire game. Unless the expansions don't fix the system it won't see the table again. For me feels like half a game that will be complete after the expansions are out. No need to interact with the other group in the game and not really any need to attack the other group (reward vs. risk). Heavy Analysis / Paralysis problem in the games I played. Too much downtime and game-lenght compared to my personal fun-factor.
After another game this is in a free-fall.

Played this as a replacement player as the Alliance Paladin position.  We did end up winning but barely since we found one of the Final Boss and had to go ahead and attack since Horde will win next phase heading into same place.  We did kill the Final boss and win but very close call.
One thing I notice is how overly complicated combat system, you have too many things to check to resolve encounter.  Hard to tell if the time invested to build up character is worthwhile or not.  Game is too long.

RATING: 7
The PVP combat is, well, just a dice fest and the rest of the game plays and feels just like Return of the Heros.  Component wise it is very well done and I am looking forward to the next game.

After playing another match I think the game might have a run-away-leader problem, but it is still fun none the less.

Team-vs-Team game with horribly complex but more-or-less simple mechanics. Prepare for a steep learning curve. It's not Twilight Imperium but don't plan on playing any other games this evening if you start a round of World of Warcraft. x-)
You have to really love long-winded tactical games to enjoy this game but then it's a pearl.
Also, the minis are fantastic – if you're playing Warcraft as a Pen-and-Paper-RPG you will find much use for the figures beyond the board game (they have D&D-conform size).

Los componentes son excelentes (Minis, cartas, tablero.. todo!). La variedad y la capacidad de configuración de los personajes es de lo mejorcito que conozco...

Por desgracia el juego resulta algo repetitivo y se echan en falta más tipos de misiones que no sean simplemente ve a tal sitio y mata X enemigos. Cuando no es tu turno no hay mucho que puedas hacer y te aburres un poco. Cada combate dura una eternidad por lo que si faltan dos o más turnos para que te toque mejor te vas a leer un libro, ver la TV o lo que quieras...

If you have a cheap or damaged set that you're having trouble getting rid of, hit me up. Missing a bunch of cards? Not a problem - I have a full set, so I don't need them. Missing several minis? Also not a problem, just be prepared to get less in trade or cash. Only have the minis? Even better - that way I won't be tempted to commit a cardinal boardgame sin and chuck half the components. Severe water damage? It's all good. 

To be clear: I really only want the minis, so sets in bad condition otherwise are preferred so that I don't hoard gameplay components from those who want the actual game.

RATING: 9.6
This was a grail game forever and I'm very happy to have finally acquired it and taken it for a spin. Turns the MMO into a great tabletop strategy game with two factions (and 2 or more players) participating in a condensed questing/pvp system. Surprisingly, it does really capture the feel of the online game, I like the area of Lordaeron which they focused the action in, and the miniature sculpts are great and for the most part seem exactly like their virtual counterparts. Dice chucking, character upgrades, sensible combat system and plenty of decisions can make for a tight, tense experience. I think it will shine with 4 or 6 players, but 2 also works well enough, and if it only had a solo co-op mode in the box I'd rate it even more highly. Also I'm kind of sad knowing this wasn't continued after The Burning Crusade.

Now to find the expansions without having to sell my organs on the black market...

This game is of very high quality, both in terms of artwork and of game mechanics.  The PvP combat is the weakest feature, so play with the endless clock variant for the best experience.  The two expansions add a lot to the game, and I recommend both of them highly.

Our last game (2 players each controlling 3 heroes with both expansions) took 12 hours to complete.  You have been warned.

I used to own this game and I gave it to some friends who enjoyed it more than me.  I think it suffers from some of the same problems as the base copy of Runebound in that the game has limited replayability.

RATING: 4
A biztató, és nem is vészesen hosszú (50 perc) szabálymagyarázat után lelkesen vetettem bele magam a játékba, annak ellenére, hogy a téma nem áll túl közel hozzám.

A karakterek fejlesztése nem túl látványos, de el lehet vele szüttyögni: átlagosan kb. fél óránként újabb tudáshoz vagy tárgyhoz jutunk, ami után pl. néhánnyal több kockával dobhatunk a jövőben, vagy kockamódosítókat szerzünk. Kezdetben néhány kockánk van, a végén max 21. Ahogy erősödünk, egyre durvább szörnyeket próbálunk meg legyőzni, akár egyedül, akár a csapattársunkkal együtt, csoportosan. Ez úgy néz ki, hogy látjuk a "választékot" a térképen, odamegyünk és puff. Van egy főellenfél, ha senki nem üti le a végéig, akkor egymást közt lejátsszuk a dolgot... Véglegesen meghalni nem lehet, max időveszteség érhet minket, ha alulmaradunk...

Az egész jó lenne, ha mondjuk 2 óra alatt lemenne. Eleinte élveztem is, fejlesztgettem a Harcosomat, de amikor már 4 órája tartott a küzdelem, kicsit monotonnak éreztem. Az a gond, hogy simán eltarthat 10 percig egy nagyobb csihipuhi, és amíg az egyikünk dob a kockákkal, módosítgat, újradob, kártyákat böngész, az a többieknek eléggé holtidő. Az 5. óra végén jött a végső harc (egymás között), amit 1 óra elteltével a kérésemre abbahagytunk. Vagy a szabály rossz, vagy a fordítás, de elképesztő hibának tartom, hogy a 2 fél a sérüléseit nettósítva viszi be egymásnak, mert így közel egyenlő ütéseknél soha se sérült senki se, és nem látszott előre, hogy 2 óra vagy akár fél év van hátra a játékból. Szóval az elnyújtott játékidő, és a katasztrofális befejezés kedvemet szegte.

Pedig alapból nem lenne rossz a játék, a játék közbeni harc mechanizmusa kifejezetten jó, kár hogy a végére más mechanizmust találtak ki!
---
Közben kiderült, hogy nem fordítási hiba, tényleg ilyen a szabály. Bizonyos képességű ellenfelek esetén lehet olyan kiegyenlített a harc, hogy gyakorlatilag végeláthatatlan... Ez nagy baj:(

A glorious, sprawling game with mounds of miniatures that stands as an epic monument to one of -- if not THE -- greatest online games of all time. A unique combat system adds character to a faithful representation of the online experience of questing, leveling, and scoring loot. Very strong theme, with lots of flavor to ensure that you never forget for a moment that you're playing World of Warcraft. Add the game soundtrack to your play space and you are transported to Azeroth, every time. Add the two expansions and you've got a trophy of a game that's just as satisfying to play as it is look at on the shelf.

This game gets tedious after the first couple hours of play.  The concept, theme, and production values are great but play time is brutal.  Toss in the fact that what you and your team do has little to no impact to the opposing team and this becomes a snooze fest.

RATING: 4
This is a well produced game that should appeal to role players, unfortunately I'm no longer one of them. Thus spending hourrs defeating monsters to level up and gain increasing powers does not bring me satisfaction. I can however enjoy the race to play efficiently and level up faster than your opponent, to either crush him in the final battle or perhaps fight the boss monster. The events that periodically occur add some interesting variety to the game, and the ability to attack and punish your opponents for poor positioning on the map is nice. However I'm beginning to notice a dislike for overproduced games like WoW, Warrior Knights, even Starcraft. Perhaps overproduced is the wrong word, but I'm referring to the overwhelming variety of different types of things you have to keep track off. Mysteriously I do not find this bothersome in games I do like such as War of the Ring or Paths of Glory, but it does seem to me that WoW has a ton of little pieces and cards. I feel that WoW is the kind of game I really would have enjoyed years ago when I liked to roleplay, but although it has some aggressive elements that could be used competitively, it doesn't have enough depth of decisions to hold my interest.

Although this takes forever to play, it can be fun, as long as you find ways to minimize the downtime.

I really like how you can personalize your character by all the skills you have available only to your class.  That's really slick, and is more fun than just adding +1 to your attack and defense after gaining X exp. points.

Not one that I'd want to play all the time, but as long as there was a big chunk of time set aside solely to play it, I'm down for it.

I love this board game because of the artwork and the miniatures. This board also has a very strong thematic from a famous MMORPG of blizzard. That's why i became fandom of this boardgame. PS: I don't play MMORPGs, but i play RPG such Dungeons & Dragons (Pen and Paper) and some fantasy board games as well.

Lots of COOL bits and components.  Captures the feel of WoW fairly well, though after multiple plays it is crying out for an expansion, which funny enough is coming out soon.  When I play I tend to stay away from PvP, and mostly just play two different games at once.  It is a good way to waste an afternoon.

The WoW Board game delivers a vanilla/old school feeling and as a long time WoW player it really felt like home.  The game has incredible customization and the expansions add even more to it.  The leveling system may seem repetitive, but while playing it doesn't feel like it is.  It actually feels natural and very WoW like.  That is also why the game is long.  So far it tooks me 3 to 6 hours (6 being with TBC) to complete the game, but if it was shorter, it would not have the mmo feeling to it.   My experience with the WoW board game is great and I recommend it, but not if you are looking for a short friendly simple board game.  The only thing I don't really like is that late game we use A LOT of dice and it's a little bit much.

* Note : The game is designed to play with the 2 factions, but I have only played with 2 players, using a single faction, creating a full co-op experience.

Love this game!  The two big points that mark this down for me, though, are the long down-time for each player and the incredibly long length of the game (I don't see how they expect one game to come in at 3 hours, and especially not with six players)!  Otherwise, love it!

Not recommended to anybody! Boring, boring, boring.. (sleep).. boring... That's sad, cause the game has some great potential. Skilling and upgrading your hero is fantastic - new weapons,bags, skills - you can really feel it! The same with the battle system - great ideas here. But this two elements are wasted in rubbish game, that lasts many hours to finish and you feel like.. well.. whatever.. nothing really happened, luck was the winner, awesomeness of your hero is not really important, monsters, slash them, monsters, treasure, monsters and rolling dices all the time. Somebody wants to buy? ;)

This game is huge, and as a non-fan or player of the MMO, I find it fascinating to play (Horde, by the way). Building the character is always a good time, and combat throws oodles of dice at you, so...yes. It takes a long time to play (especially when I have to teach someone every game), so I rarely get to break it out, at least not as much as I would really like to.

Hmm...Ermm..Hmm.Addicted to the online game but the boardgame although it looks fantastic has a rather dry feel to it. You go here you fight this, then go there and fight that. You don't really intearct much with the opposing team unless you end up in a PVP dice fest at the end, something which I have avoided thankfully so far. Dont know what it is just havent quite taken to it.

I've played this game many times. It has nice hero leveling- it is the best in this game. But it is long and quite boring at the end. Go to the some place-> throw a lot of dices-> look at the result and reroll as many as you can/need-> take the loot/level up. The worst is that at the end of the game you will have almost the limit of all types of dices and probably a lot of rerolls, so game will be realy easy. The nice thing is that it has a lot of miniatures, cards and content which looks good. I think that the game can have +2 or +3 for people who like Warcraft universe, because quests has some storries and it is nice but im not a fan of the universe.

I bought this game shortly after it came out. It hasn't seen a lot of play time, but it wasn't without merit, either. It was a little to finicky for me, but it did have an interesting combat mechanic. It also came with an insane amount of figures. Overall, however, it was only OK.

Maybe, had I ever played the videogame, I would enjoy World of Warcraft The Boardgame way more than I do: but I didn’t, so I can’t say I find it appealing at all, as it simply has so many downsides that even the gamer I am - one who looks for lots of dice, theme and randomness when playing - can’t but find annoying.

First of all, it’s way too long: then, the game splits the group into two subgroups who don’t care for each other unless when a little PvP is up. As a consequence of the former, you must endure endless downtime between your turns: finally - and this is what I dislike the more here - this game requires too many calculations for doing anything.

I’ve been told this boardgame makes a good job of recreating the same feeling as the videogame; anyhow, as it is, it isn’t exactly my cup of tea: it surely appeals to the kind of games I enjoy but still doesn’t impress me so much.

A great game that makes a unique experience of combat. Downtime can be long for the team that's not currently active, but as experience is gained in the turns, it becomes much less. More interaction between the factions would be nice, some kind of incentive for PvP combat, other than via an event card.

This is the game Talisman should have been...depth of character development, variety of quests & items, Team Vs Team PVP and three interesting Final Boss monsters...plus all the flavor and excellent graphic design of the computer game. With a built-in turn limit, this game has flavor, depth, fun and focus. Of Runebound, Talisman, and World of Warcraft, I'd have to vote for WoW as the best light fantasy strategy game. Looking forward to many years of enjoyment and expansions to this one.

This game scratches the itch for leveling and character progression. It isn't perfect and there is lots of luck, but the feeling of gaining power, abilities, talents, items, and armor is just a fun one in any game. I think this one comes the closest for me to hitting the sweet spot of character progression, etc in board game format (maybe Mage Knight, but it feels more tangible in this one due to the familiarity from the computer game).

The time of 180 minutes to play is an absolute joke.  Game time was 5 hours with 2 players playing 2 characters each.  My first game his second.  This is pretty good except the time to play.  Which will be cut drastically the next time it is played. Luckily we set aside the time knowing this would be the case.

Played a second game with The Shadow of War and The Burning Crusade expansions.  We played with 6 players; 1 played twice, 2 played once, the other three were new.  Six players six hours.  Expansions add choices but the game is still too long.  I don't mind five hours with six but the last hour dragged on.  Dropped rating due to game length.

Great co-operative game, but play time can be quite long.  Plus there is a lot going on at any given moment and each team tends to be a little unaware of what the other team is up to.  I'm sure this will lessen with game experience... beautiful presentation!!!

Odd game to rate for me.  I can't figure out what I like about it, but I always have a great time playing it and want to play again (unfortunately nobody else seems to think consecutive plays is a good idea.)  I'm constantly trying to decide whether to raise or lower my rating, but I do know that I want to play again.

Edit:  The end game issues and the similarity in how I typically find that I have to build characters now is leading me to think that I don't like this as much as I did.  I like the character-building aspects a lot, but after enough plays, the game starts to feel very repetitive.  Changed from 9 to 7.

Edit: Changed from 7 to 9.5 after some house-ruling to change the endgame so as to focus on just enjoying the experience of character-building and the fun combat.

After a couple of plays I can say that I love this game.  Amazing combat system, incredible character development and a lot of flavour from the computer game.  Lots of decisions to make as you play, and the variety of quests is great!  The boss was defeated on turn 27 by the horde, and it was only the first game for most of the players.  The play time was long, but since it was the first game for most a lot of time was spent learning.  Future games will be faster, and once we know all of the classes and powers/talents the time will be reduced even more.  Fantastic game!

We've played this quite a bit more, and I enjoy it more and more with each play.  I love complex games, and I love options which this game has loads of!  Play time does tend to be longish, but not overly long.  It's amazing how the nights fly by in Lorderon!  I'm idly contemplating painting the hero figures.  There are WAY too many monsters to paint, and after my aborted attempt to paint the Descent critters I'd really have be nuts to even consider doing the monsters for this game.  Yes, I've been that crazy before, with Warhammmer Fantasy, 40k armies....

Whatever you do, IGNORE the pvp ending and just play until one team kills the overlord.  The pvp ending is tedious and LAME.

RATING: 3
Rating based on one full game - so might alter, but given the length of time to play I can't see this hitting the table that often as it's not that great. Two teams race to level up and collect items and you ignore your opponents most of the time because the map is so big and movement rather difficult - not helped by all the independant creatures that appear and 'block' slowing you down for no gain for killing them. Interaction is very limited, and usually only happens if certain events appear. Real killer is the downtime between turns, you play approx 15 turns in 4 hours and half the time you're waiting for your opponents to finish their turn.

Update - Traded my copy, doubt I'll play this again

WoW has the coolest combat system for any adventure game ever made! Trying to figure out the optimal "builds" is a lot of fun too (and gives the players something to do during their opponent's turn).
Since a storyline isn't really present, I'd almost call this a combat game instead of an adventure game (since there's not much adventure to speak of, and instead it's all about combat and leveling (even moreso than Descent)).

edit: 10 years later and this game still holds up incredibly well! In all this time, there still hasn't come out another game with such a heavy focus on leveling and building up your character.

As a WoW online addict, I didn't think I'd like this rendition of the game.  Why bother?  I have my PC already.  But actually my enjoyment of the boardgame was, if anything, enhanced by my enjoyment of the original MMORPG.  The combat system is elegant, the quests entertaining, the characters varied -- but, most importantly, it captures the feel of the computer game very well whilst managing to capitalise on the differences between boardgames and PC games so that it remains a wholly individual identity.  I also liked the combination of co-operative and competitive play between the two faction teams.

However, we all accelerated in power far too much, far too fast; the creatures very quickly became too easy and no longer a challenge.  Runebound, Talisman and Mystic Wood all suffered from this as well; I guess it's the balance between challenge and reward: if a reward makes the next challenge easier, you gain more rewards, and so on and upwards, power-scaling geometrically.

fantastic game it is just like the computer game. It takes a long time to play but if you like experience points and levelling characters and getting new skills then this is awesome.
The game would be significantly faster if all the players had their own dice but that could set you back 50 quid or more which may not be worth it for a game that wouldn't get played that often due to it taking a long time to play (chicken and egg situation)
I would do the house rules of starting at higher levels mentioned on BGG.

Essentially a cooperative game: Players are divided into two fractions, each playing on their own against the board. The two fractions race against each other, but there is almost no interaction between fractions, since there is effectively no advantage in attacking the other fraction (possible).

The boardgame seems to capture the flavour of the online game very well (as far as I can tell and have been told) and plays surprisingly fast without boring pauses, thanks to its streamlined mechanics.

The keypoint is gathering XP and items. (Surprise! :-P ) There is no penalty for dying, apart from the setback of not winning XP and items as scheduled. Since the number of actions is severely limited and the other fraction is accumulating XP and items as well, determining the overall gain of each fraction member's action is paramount.

RATING: 5.5
If you take it for what it is- a dice chucking, light hearted, down-and-dirty, through and through Ameritrash game, it's a great way to spend a long night. There is an epic feel when you take out a big creature like a Drake, or even the boss. You definitely feel like you're trying to one-up each other throughout the game and get that edge on your opponents. And if the night goes too long and you need to end it, you can just have a huge PvP battle to settle the winner. FOR THE HORDE!!!!

One of the worst games in the history of games. Multi-player solitaire--in this case that's a bad thing. There are one or two choices you can make in levelling up. Player interaction with the opposition is effectively zero and close to zero with your own team mates. The game drags on for hours. The dice rolling is fun but the luck of the draw for missions can ruin the game. Can't get new quest 
till existing quest removed, can't get to new quest since it's on other side of map, takes too long to get there even if non-quest monsters didn't block movement for a turn or need to be walked around (if possible). Played more than half a dozen times and stopped playing games with those friends in case they wanted to play, I despise this game.

Cool combat system that is set up to allow a lot of modifications due to player powers.  The game does suffer from downtime problems, but its still a good time.  

Upon further reflection, I have decided to downgrade this one.  Downtime is a problem, but my major critique is the blue monsters.  They server as a roadblock which is evil enough, why do they have to be super-powerful with no rewards?  I don't like them.  

--Update: This is a fun game that gets better with beer.  The players powers are a lot of fun and the synergy between the 3 teams members is a blast.  I still don't like the blue monsters, they should be weak and pitiful and still would serve the purpose of being a roadblock/speedbump.  Upgraded to an 8.

Enjoyable fantasy pseudo-rpg.  The closest competitor is probably Runebound.  Games like Warhammer Quest and Descent are dungeoncrawls in nature and have a very different feel.  One nice thing this game has, somewhat like Warhammer Quest, is a very specific character advancement system.  That is, there are unique powers and paths to choose from during advancement.  This is much more interesting than the more generic modes of advancement that Runebound and Descent use.  There are character decks for Runebound, but they felt more pasted on than the advancement in WoW.  Same thing can be said about this as with Runebound: I can't really see playing it with six.  Woe unto you.  Works well as a two or four player game, while trying to do as much during the other guys turn as possible (leveling, planning out turns, training, etc).  The combat system is great.  I like that there is a feeling of quick strikes and defense coupled with the attrition factors of a long battle.  Fun game - but be prepared for a long one.

Not enough activity in the 4 hours it took to play (and that was after we'd spent an hour learning the rules previously).  To play well, a lot of time must be spent considering which artifacts to purchase for the character and this mostly solo time has to be spent while others are waiting (alternatively, the game owner has an unfair advantage if he plans this ahead of time).  This ruins much of the fun for me and makes the game feel slow.  When I played, the turn limit hit just a bit too soon to be ready to fight the boss, and the PvP battle which resulted was annoying.  It's also possible for a badly placed blue monster to lock out part of the board for some time.  The game has some promise, but I still prefer Talisman (which takes longer but has more action).  It's possible this could get more fun with a group of regular players.

Gift from my 2007 Secret Santa! One play in and I really enjoy it. The character customization is deep and unique for each class. It took a long time to get through everything, but I am sure that it will go much faster with each play. There are two expansions available if I ever want to spice things up more. I don't think that will be needed for a while.

Dire. Takes too long to play. Too much sitting around doing nothing while the other players take their overly long turns. Game can also (as it did) end up as a draw after 2-3 hours of playing. Not fun. Dead weight. Leave it on the shop shelf.

I truly enjoyed my first session with this game, having borrowed it to see what the fuzz was all about. Loaded with cool game mechanics and the whole hoard vs. alliance thing is pretty awesome - I thought this was just Runebound in a WarCraft environment and was very glad to find out that I was wrong.

Beautiful cards, very cool miniatures that are true to the PC game (in terms of looks anyway), loads of characters to play - each with their own deck of abilities and stuff, and a pretty neat way of dealing with combat. Highly recommended to all fans of fantasy and RPGs.

080804: Now that I've played it again I no longer wanna trade it away - had a real blast this time around! Everything went so much smoother, which is thanks to boardgameswithscott.com and the video review there that explains pretty much everything in detail :) Again, I really like how combat works and customizing your characters is cool. Can't wait to play it again!

There were parts of the game I liked a LOT...and parts that hurt me inside.

1) The development and the team aspect were neat. I enjoyed the decisions in building up my character and trading stuff around/planning with my teammates. Seems unlikely that there is much direct conflict with the other team prior to game end, though.

2) The big boss fight at the end works OK. The timing of it and such seems fine. But the alternate end where the teams fight each other...is just SOOO painful! Each team rolls about 200 dice and then after all the damage blocking occurs one team distributes like 2 points of damage. Rinse and repeat for an hour or more. 

All the fun decision-making of the early part of the game is removed in the finale. Is this really the best they could come up with for ending the game? 

When I play a game of this length, I want a few things. I want interesting decisions. I want a position that I can build up over the course of the game (in this case development of my character). And I want a satisfying ending/climax. 

I'd be willing to play again, but I think I'd just be willing to call it a tie if no one has defeated their big boss by game end.

After one play! 
I had a great time playing this game. There are many decisions to make throughout the game from character development to choosing the difficulty of your quests (the harder they are the more experience and treasure you get...if you survive, of course). Nice player interaction between teammates. The combat system is novel and very clever.
Interaction between opponents could be better. Seemed like the object was to keep up with the other team (similar level). Not so much conflict between teams until the end. Killing an opponent allowed the victor to steal an item from their backpack and sends them home (was not a very big deal in the game I played, just wasted a bit of time for the victim). The game is expensive but the components are quality (painting the figures would add to the look of the game).

Overall a fun game, looking forward to playing again very soon.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
Well, someone beat me to the comment but I'll repeat it- shallow gameplay obscured by scads of figures and components.  WoW is probably exactly the sort of game I'd expect from a license aimed at the sort of folks that made that "hilarious" Leeroy Jenkins video and who spend more time living a vicarious online life in their parents' basement while the real world passes them by but I expect more from Fantasy Flight as a company and from Christian Petersen as a designer.  The game is- simply put- dumb, grossly overproduced, repetitive, and too long by at least two hours.  All the hype and chrome masks a game that is little more than an a Risk variant (no, really) where players represent customizable/upgradable characters that fight randomly spawned monsters instead of enemy armies.  The "quests" are nothing more than locations where monsters pop up and a paragraph of vague flavor text that might mean more if you've played the MMORPG.  Items are little more than additional dice and rerolls with different names and costs.  The combat system, based on a somewhat clumsy dice pool mechanic that grossly over-values ranged combatis really the heart of the game and that makes the game all about getting equipment and abilities to shift the odds in your favor- not much strategy or decision making, particularly since many of the talents and items are clearly useless for certain characters.  While I was playing I kept thinking that if it were 45 minutes- like Nexus Ops or Monsters Menace America- I'd probably adore it as a fun, quick action game but with all the piles of cards and players mulling over which cards to pick or purchase it never will be and the downtime for the inactive team is pretty much the end of any fun this game has to offer considering there is little if any meaningful player interaction between the sides unless someone does a PVP attack.  The cooperation element is pretty shallow as well- it's basically either concentrate fire and split the rewards or split apart and level up quicker at higher risk.  There are some event cards that make the game a little more interesting, but they really do little to give the game any depth or substance- more monster spawns or movements, some side quests, and the like.   The components are fine, but have people forgotten that there was a time that you could buy bags of figures of this quality for 99 cents at any grocery store?  Do we need a counter for EVERY OTHER WORD in the rulebook?   In all, I think the game is a failure because it's just too bloated of a production to support such a basic and simplistic game that requires a ridiculous amount of administration to play.  I'm sure it'll be a smash hit with casual gamers and I can definitely see groups that usually play Munchkin or any of those horrid gamer-geek cash-in games stepping up to WoW, but as for me I'll stick with Arkham Horror, Talisman, or Return of the Heroes when I'm looking for an adventure board game.  A rare total miss for FFG as far as I'm concerned, and my vote for the worst game of 2005.

Looooong game the first few plays.  Only played two-player so far.  And didn't finish either game.  I imagine this is a four hour game (Burning Crusade) with a little practice.  Way rad, and it's a shame that we're "not prepared".  :)

May 2012 - Yep, still long.  Solo game I just started isn't finished after 5.5 hours.  Gonna have to finish it up tomorrow or something.  Good times, though I'm still moving slowly at this one.  Would be hard to get this one done in under six hours, I think (unless it's a solo joint).  Edit - oops, 13 hours to finish game.  Damn, I'm slow.  It was Stormrage, but still.

May 2012 - Second solo game going much more quickly.  Three hours in and my guys are fifth level.  Gear and powers are shitty though.  Probably be a six hour game.  Way more reasonable.

I really enjoy this game.  The figures and map are really nice and the leveling system is truly innovative. The combat system is excellent although it takes a little getting used to. Its set up Alliance vs. Horde but it really plays well co-op. You travel around Azeroth completing quests/killing monsters and leveling up.

I wanted to love this game. Sadly, it barely survived one unfinished playing with my children, who are quite savvy about these games and enjoy almost everything in my collection. We just felt it was tedious constantly recalculating which colored dice everyone was going to roll -- more than anything, this dynamic, which read well on paper, bogged us down. The graphics are beautiful in the game, and I want to love it as I said. But as it is, I'd have to be convinced by someone to pull it off the shelf anytime in the near future. And even though I'm a serial acquirer of the expansions to such games, no motivation to expand this one.

Boring. Some great mechanics (the combat system is pretty neat), but just a real chore to actually play. This game would be better by upping the danger level and time element, and making it a cooperative game. (Beat the evil overlord by turn 20 or you're doomed!) Sucks as a competitive game.

Love this game! It is perfect with just the base set, and leaving out the overlords. Its easy to teach to new players and almost every gamer knows enough about WoW to be interested in it.

Great game.  Just gotta get at least one other person to commit the hours to play it.  This would almost certainly rank higher if I could cut play-time in half.  Additionally, it's a great solo board game--again, if you have a few hours to spare. It weighs in at about 3 hours+ for a solo game (as long as you know what you're doing), so I imagine that would probably increase with the player count.  Still, There's something that keeps you coming back for more, despite the lengthy play time.

FWIW:  Among my favorite solos are Robinson Crusoe, Firefly: The Game, LotR: The Fellowship Deck Builder, Labyrinth: The War on Terror 2001-?, and Lewis & Clark.

RATING: 4
First time i played this it was kind of light fun, a little long but about a 6-7 rating, my next game was mostly just dull.
The problems are:
Opponents turns are very long and of 95% of the time hold no consequence for your own side, occasionally the 2 sides want to be the first to get to a certain place, but on the whole the opponents turn is irrelevent, just 10-30 minutes of downtime.
There are no meaningful descisions to make, choice of quest is always obvious, each class has a clear best progression of abilities.
My second game was very repetitive, the same quests, the same monsters and the same locations every game. the system is quite clever in the way it mixes the wandering and the quest monsters, but is ultimately repetitive.
Wandering monsters are nothing but speedbumps, no incentive or reward for killing them, which just makes them irritating. A GP or random roll for an item would have been nice.

I love long games, i love fantasy quest type games, but this is massivley over produced and too long for it's level of thought required.
Having cardboard tokens for mosters would not detract from the game
and would have made a more reasonable package.

Surprising amount of depth.  To my great surprise, this made me want to go get the computer game - the background is that well developed and it shows even within the limits of the board game.  My only complaint is that the time limit seems a bit on the short side, and depending on the party mix one side may be at a serious disadvantage in the forced player-versus-player battle when time runs out - though there is an option to remove it.

A sprawling box of dice combat and character leveling. Compared to more recent games in this genre like FFG's Runebound, the focus of the game is combat. Despite your best efforts though, you can lose with unlucky dice rolling as there are few ways to mitigate the roll and the monsters scale with the more dice you gain. The game does take a long time but a set number of rounds ensures that you can't waste actions and that the game ends without going on even longer.

Mini quality is decent though by today's standards it is a bit lacking. The character leveling and customization is light but the options really thematically bring out the tech trees of the MMORPG.

I wish I got to play this more often.  It takes up a huge table space, and a chunk of time.  I'd love to be able to explore the dozen (hundred?) or so builds each character has to progress through.  I have mostly played solo/partnership, and it works fine.  THere are rules for this in the threads.  When I play, I use the Shadows of War expansion, which, like most Fantasy Flight first released expansions, I feel is required for the game.

Buy an extra set of dice.  It helps speed things along.  I could see where there would be downtime isses when played with two teams as intended.

It should also be said that I came into this game with no prior knowledge of anything Warcraft, computer game or otherwsie, but have grown to enjoy the setting and classes.

Played three times. 
First time, two of us spent a day learning the rules and then played on the second day and enjoyed it.
Second time, a few weeks later, we played with four of us, and the game dragged on, and on, and on, and then we gave up as it stopped being fun an hour or two ago and looked like there might be another hour or two to go
Third time, several years later, played with a friend and his son. Assumed I still knew the rules. Gave up after an hour or so after spending at least half that time with my nose in the rule book.
I want to like it, but it really makes you work to get fun out of it.

Wow, I can't believe that so many people rated this game well!  To be fair, I have never played any of the computer games so this rendition might be constrained by some of the computer game play.  To me, the chrome was INCREDIBLE!!  Wonderful.  You can't help but fall in love with how cool everything looks.  But the flip side for me is the game play.  There is an incredible amount of accounting that is tedious.  A computer would be great to keep track of all that stuff...

I gave it a 3 because there is a slight chance that someone could get me to play it again.  Mostly because I love the adventure theme and I can't help but think about how to make the game better as I am trudge through several hours of accounting.  To be honest, I think I only had 1 difficult decision to make the whole game.  I could not for the life of me figure out which item I should equip myself with.  I waffled back and forth many times, but this was a large part because there were so many things to keep track of that I would realize that I had forgotten one essential element.  Beautiful game.  Tedious game play.  No wait, there were elements I enjoyed.  I liked working on a team.  That was fun.  Especially because there was a lot of information to process through.  I simply wish that we had all been on the same team because I did not get a chance to follow anything the other team did (and indeed, I did not need to follow anything they did because none of it affected me).

Ahh, it'll be so great when someone comes out with a good adventure game...  I can't wait!  :-)

This game is actually really fun to play with a new group of people for about 6 plays.  After that you're done.  There aren't enough different adventures to go on, by the time anybody goes to kill the boss it's no contest, and I've never played in a game where the Horde has been able to win.

The game offers a huge number of fantastic components, excellent abstraction and translation of the computer game combat into the board game and good amounts of both cooperative and competitive play. The amount of time it requires and the fact that it only really makes sense with six players render it nearly useless. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This really nails the fun part of developing a character.  The class-specific power decks combined with the different item decks are really fun to fiddle and tweak.  But MAN, this game is nothing like WoW in structure or combat.  No quest hub cities for the former, no range, aggro or adds for the latter.  I think this game would have been better without the WoW license since it is a crushing disappointment in that area.  But beyond that, it is a really fun computer-style RPG.  

Update 6-4: Runebound is way better for this type of game.  RB has more interaction, more tactics, more cool item powers.  Better in every way.

RATING: 5
Players take a fantasy character, each with a "class", such as cleric, and a faction.  Allies in the faction cooperate to complete quests to gain experience and advance their characters.  As characters grow more powerful, they can challenge the game "boss" to try and claim victory for their faction.  If the boss isn't defeated by the end of turn 30, the factions face off in a player vs. player battle.  This is an enjoyable "experience" game, as you nuture your character along, and build up the strength of your alliance.  Combat is initially confusing, however quickly becomes comfortable.  The apparent combat complexity works well, as the different weapons, abilities and monsters interact into the combat mechanics in subtle and clever ways.  I enjoyed the game, but it is several hours long and takes up way too much space for most gaming tables.  Components are excellent.  Summary, if you're a fantasy hack and slash fan then you'll be in hog heaven, otherwise it's a very big and very long fantasy themed boardgame.

Pretty good game, but it often feels like a lot of time goes by between player turns.  The combat mechanics are different, and take a little getting used to, but the theme of the game is good.

The rulebook is remarkably well written, and all the cards and components seem very cool.  However, it seems as though Runebound (which I love) gives a "cleaner", less fiddly experince.  Right now I'm thinking I'd rather complete my Runebound collection than get into this.

Excellent game to play Coop. Out of the box it is fun, until you realize that the two teams can actually play the game completely independent of each other.  At that point, it is more of a Coop game that two teams play at the same time.

The production value of this game is outstanding. This is a great game for what it is. With the right group with the right mindset this is a blast. Do not play this with Eurogamers though, they are going to hate it. Same goes for people who have frequent analysis paralysis syndrome; if you play that game with them, it will drive you crazy. There are just too many things to consider, especially if a player plays 2 characters. In the adventure game genre, this is a very good one.

I appreciate this game better now that I have played the computer game. It is better to go into it then someone perhaps approaching it from scratch. Though you need to give this game a chance as it gets better with repeat plays as you know your characters more. Being organised also helps and planning your turn during your opponents' turn.

I bought this when it came out new. I was a dumb highschool kid and couldn't apprecitate this for what it was (All I knew at the time was it wasn't as fun as the computer game and it costed alot of hours of my work to get). Fast forward ten years and it was taking up space in the shed and one of the corners where blown out some so... I tossed out all the cards, board, and box. Then I kept the minis. Then 3 months later I got back into board gaming and looked up what it was worth.... FUDGE THE BUCKET!!! If you are missing just a single figure or something from the base game and will pay postage I think I could help you out. I painted some of the figures for a warband.

Por el momento sólo hemos jugado una partida a dos con la variante colaborativa. Y por los pelos en el turno 29 hemos ganado.

No se que, pero al juego le falta algo, un poco soso. No es que algo no funcione bien (parece un reloj suizo) sino que se hace algo repetitivo y previsible, supongo...

El problema es que sin haber otra facción se nos hizo algo largo, cuando probemos con dos facciones creo que se hará eterrrrno :P

To me the game is too long and takes too long to set up and put away to really make this an enjoyable experience.  I also find there is a lack of player interaction between horde and alliance (due to choosing talents/abilities and planning out your next phase with your partner if you have one during your opponents turn) and if the two ever meet in combat, unless you've played that class before you wonder how your opponents get X number of dice or is able to automatically generate Y amount of automatic hits or defense tokens, etc. Blah.

WoW has many potential options for character between equipment and skills.  This means that replayability is high, and time can *drag*.  Figuring out the various 'ewok' tricks can soak up an inordinate amount of time as each team tries to optimize strategy.I would not play this as a six player game... two may be best.     WoW is a classic fantasy adventure game.  If you don't like the genre, don't try this game.

This is my favorite combat system that uses dice.  Usually I don't like dice as a randomness mechanic, but this is not all that random.  You have a great deal of control over the probabilities in a wide variety of ways.  I have found that it only plays well with either exactly 4 or exactly 6 players.  Other numbers of players make the game drag on too long.  I would have preferred a runebound-style free-for-all rather than the team based gameplay.

As a long time but now ex World of Warcraft MMO player this was probably an easy buy, even though reviews are very mixed.
But after a bunch of sessions with this game, despite the 7 hour marathons and sometimes long waiting periods, the extensive amount of space needed and some rough edges/imbalances here and there: It's a very fun game that deserves at least a try.
Also if you know the materia, it really adds some to the fun as you'll recognize all the skills, talents and of course the impressive Overlords. All the Warcraft style and art is spot on and will please every fan as much as you can expect.

The game has intrigued me when I've seen it in stores and read about it on line.  I have to admit that when I read that it was designed by Christian T. Petersen right after he designed Twilight Imperium 3 (a favortite game for me), I was sold and got myself a copy.

I've read where people compare this game to Runebound but I don't think so.  I really like Runebound too but this game actually reminds me of Arkham Horror.

The dice rolling makes this a lot of fun. The only complaint I have is that down-time between turns can be long.

I do have one complaint.  By the time I discovered the bronze components expansion, which evidently was sold as 2 expansions because of cost, I was too late and was only able to purchase 1 set.

RATING: 7
World of Warcraft is a massive game that will take a massive amount of time.
Where WoW shines is in the artwork and components.  The game looks very much like the Warcraft world found on the computer, and the plastic figures representing the various members of the bestiary and the players' characters are very well sculpted. Often when a new figure is place, the people playing enjoy looking at the figure before placing it on the board.
If you have played the online game, you will be at an advantage as you will recognize the creatures, characters, and places on the game board map.  If you are not familiar with the World of Warcraft universe, you might find it more difficult to dig through the large number of models to find the one you need to for the quest.  A bestiary in the rules would've been nice. 
The game is very much a cooperative game.  You will need to work with your friends to complete quests.  There are two factions, Horde and Alliance, and they are in competition, but never really fight each other in the game.  It's possible to fight, but you do not gain any real reward for it, and it wastes valuable time, both in reality and in game-terms.  The game ends after 30 turns (15 for each faction).  At the 30th turn, each faction must fight and beat the world boss (main bad guy).
The fact that you have two different factions allows for more people to play (up to 6), but while that faction is taking their turn, the other faction really has nothing to do. It leads to a great amount of down time, especially if people are not familiar with the game mechanics and are looking up rules all the time.  I find this game works much better as a 3-player co-op with all three players on the same faction, and just skipping over the opposing faction's turn.  That makes the game 15 turns, and it still takes us about 4 to 5 hours to complete.
I do enjoy playing the game and find it fun, but there are a few problems.  This is a massive, massive game with many components.  You need a huge table to play with 3 people and the expansion, and the flight-deck of an aircraft carrier to play with 6.  Also, the rulebook does not feel that well organized and the game can be overwhelming your first time through with many game pauses to look something up.  This just adds more to the down time.  Did I mention down time?  Easily 75% of this game involves no fighting at all, but rather time spent picking equipment, talents, and spells.  It's not a bad thing if you enjoy character building and working with your group to build characters that compliment one another.  The base game has many, many types of cards to add to your character's stats.  It offers a lot of customization and variety, but if you are expecting constant dice rolling and fighting, you will be disappointed. You will usually end up spending roughly half your turns doing quests.  That means about six to eight. Sometimes even fewer.  That is the juxtaposition with this game.  While the box is full of quests and monsters, you really only encounter a handful of them in your playing session.  It's cool to have all these cool figures and items, but at times if feels like a good portion of the game is superfluous.  For instance, the base game comes with a large selection of blue colored creatures.  When a quest is chosen, often times it will have two creatures listed, a blue one and one of another color.  You place both on the board where indicated; however you need only to kill the non-blue creature to complete the quest.  The blues just sit on the board to populate the regions and make the world look less empty, but provide no rewards at all for fighting them.  In video game terms, these are called trash mobs.  They are not part of a quest, but help fill-out the world, only in the video game, you do at least get some experience and treasure for killing them.  This is addressed in the Shadow of War expansion, but even then, you only have so many turns until the end of the game, and with so much down time, when you don get to fight, you don't want to waste it fighting a blue creature.
Okay, so here's my conclusion: The game components are top quality.  You get your money's worth with all the plastic figures and cards. However, while the large quantity creates variety, it also increases the price, the space needed to play, and makes setup and breaking down of the game very lengthy and tedious.
The fun factor is medium to high playing with three people on one faction as a cooperative game, but gets boring and tedious playing with two factions.  One side will be spending half the time (and it's a long game) doing nothing.
This is a game that we do not play that often.  The variety of components and character choices lends itself to re-playability but the time commitment, space requirement, and arduous setup, make people not want to play that often.
With those two expansions, I would bump my rating for the game up, but but only by 1/2 a point.  The expansion add mainly more of the same, but with a few elements that address the pacing of the game.
My verdict is a 7 (7.5 with expansions).

Tema legal. Jogo muito bonito. Muitas miniaturas. Regras relativamente fáceis mas muito tempo de partida. Cada jogador ou cada time contra o tabuleiro. A interessação e o conflito de área é muito pequeno. O sistema de batalha é bem interessante, uma mistura de rolagens de dados que geram range, mility e defense.  Os combos com personagens, habilidades, equipamentos, experiência, etc são bem divertidos de montar. Na metade em diante do jogo fica muito difícil de ver todas as opções de todos os jogadores pois cada um fica com combinações complicadas. Não gostei do fato de cada aliança jogar "separadamente". Isso é o que faz pensar "será que vale jogar 6 horas", no restante o jogo é muito bom.

This is a good translation of the MMORPG.  Gameplay mechanics cause a lot of upkeep and generally make the game last about twice as long as it should.

Long and random. I'd have preferred a game with a bona fide quest. You know, with a beginning, middle and an end. World of Warcraft has you running and flying around the board in no particular order, bashing monsters and stealing their stuff. It's Ok, but it could have been so much better if it generated a story line along the way.

It also suffers from a lack of player interaction, although it seems to think it should have some. For example, for no particular reason there are 2 teams, but really there could have been 3, 4 or none as far as the logic of the game demands.

A very good take on the subject matter. A boardgame that captures the constant questing, developing your character and warfare between two factions of WoW quite nicely. Very good combat system that allows for lots of different approaches for each character. Negatives includes longish playing time (partly because AP-prone players have lots of details to worry about. Without them, the game plays a lot quicker) and some occasional end-game PvP-fights that can drag on for a long time. Curiously, the game is lots of fun in solo and co-operative mode, because you get to keep almost all the good stuff and can ignore most of the bad stuff.

Awesome to roam Azeroth, pick up quests, beat monsters and bosses and get stronger on the way. This game has one of the most amazing combat systems I have ever encountered. But, combat takes quite long and it gets boring after the first couple fights. In general, too, the game is long. It easily takes 3+ hours (less if you play only cooperatively with altered rules). The translation of my Dutch copy is really, really bad. There are grammatical or typographical errors in at least every other sentence, and quite a number of items, spells and quests are referred to wrongly (e.g. an item is called a "green chest plate" on the quest but a "topaz armour" on the item itself).

If you like WoW then you might like this.  It's sorta fun seeing the characters, critters and spells pop up that you run into in the game.  Your team pretty much does its thing while the other team does theirs, so it's sort of like playing two games at once and it's a race to finish your game first.  This is a positive and a negative, but it does hold to the idea of different factions in the computer game.  I say that if someone doesn't make it to end then both sides lose.  The idea of all out PvP at the end seems silly and tacked on.

Fun game once in a while.  Might be better with 4 players rather than 6 I think.

RATING: 5
My original rating of 7 is based on it being a "6" for its merits as a fantasy-romp-lite-rpgish game with player interaction. There are a LOT of cards and chits to keep track of. It's an "8" if you like World of Warcraft (online). I love being able to recognize all the maps, creatures, items, even the icons. It's much more fun for people who already love WoW. Re-rated at "5" because I'm pretty much done with WoW online now.

RATING: 7.5
I've been playing the PC game for a few months now.  I love that version, so I had to get the board version to see what it was like.  Captures the feel of the online game pretty well, just takes a little while to play through.

RATING: 6
Now this is a huge game. It looks great but I dislike FFG's practise of casting miniatures in such garish colours. Anyway, we played this once or twice and it was kind of fun with a particularly enjoyable battle system. This really needs some more play before I can give it a thumbs up.

Edit: Monster games like this require too much effort to relearn when played infrequently. As such its on its way out.

This is yet another game that appeals to me simply because it looks like (based from the previews submitted) it's a game heavy with dice. The theme is also one that interests me, though I've never actually played the video game itself.

RATING: 7
The components in this are amazing.  You get a great board a better set of miniatures and a ton of cards and counters.  This takes up a ton of space though.  A great game, reminding me of classics like Talisman.  The only issue is that it can be very long, and you pretty much have to put a night asside just to play this.  Due to the length I can't rate this higher then 7 (as 8 is never turn down a game) actual gameplay rates an 8 or 9 at least though, just the time factor reduces it.

Advanced gamers only.  The epidemy of Ameritrash games.  Many, many chits, lots of high quality miniatures, detailed board and lots of cards.  The rules are many and will be read and reread over and over.  The game can run on awhile.  Almost mandatory house rules to make game playable at a reasonable pace.  Good fun if you like epic games.

RATING: 8
This game has really well caught the RPG flavour in a boardgame. Only the length and the small interaction between the teams brings down the rating, but I don't bother so much, although it will be less played due to this. Another disadvantage is that it takes a LOT of place, although less than Railroad Tycoon.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Greatly exceded expectations.  But similar to Runebound, if you don't like this type of game, it will in no way change your opinion.  Lot of luck and there is quite a bit of downtime.  That said, it is a great translation of WoW to a boardgame.  Game length is an issue.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not my cup of tea and the game plays very long, particularly with some turns being long enough to leave the table, walk the dog and still get back before its your turn again.

The dice pool mechanics of the combat, though, are really cool.

[JAN 09] [Rating: 8]
I have never played the computer game and really, I have no desire to do it either, but I like this game. There are several reasons, but I think there are primarily two things about this game that I really like. The combat, while convoluted is fun. Roll a bunch of dice and manipulate them to your advantage. It is not the fastest way to resolute combat, but there won’t be too many of them in this game anyway so I like that they made it this complex. Actually, when I come to think about it, it looks like they made the game around the combat system. To make the combat system even more interesting, every player has some talents, powers and equipment. And that is the second thing I really like about this game; the building up characters. With expansions this becomes even more interesting since you have more ways to build your character.

There are groups of players that can play this in two to three hours, but not our group. The fastest game I have played with my group is in five hours and that was with four players. That is also my largest quibble with the game; it takes a day to play for us, so we really have to plan when we play it. There is downtime in the game, but it is nothing that concerns me because either I can look what the other team does or I can plan out how to build my character.

Having played it with both 4 and 6 players I like both, but I think I prefer playing with four players. I don’t think I would get that much enjoyment of it as a 2-player game. You should definitely be an even number of players.

RATING: 7
Oh, Fantasy Flight Games - such promise, such titles, such colored plastic, yet these games always seem to fail to deliver on their potential. I bought this game because I was interested in playing with a team - but the grinding nature of the game, espeically the end-game makes it boring to play at times - although perhaps this is FFG's attempt to remain true to the source material?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While the goal of the game is simple (Hack & Slash) there is a lot of bookkeeping and of course dice rolling. As you progress you're getting more items and becoming stronger and  but so do the monsters. Therefore it's a kind of repetitive action during 4hrs with only more dice at the end. On the strategic layer the game lacks of deepness, because all the quests are the same (go there and kill that monster). Not a bad game at all but despite all the stuff also not an excellent one. I have to check if the game improves with the expansion, otherwise my rating will go down to 5.

I was actually very impressed.  They've managed to transfer a lot of the flavor of the online game to the board game, without being caught up in making sure that every detail is identical.  In fact, most aspects of the board game only resemble the PC game in spirit, bearing no mechanical resemblance whatsoever.  I think that's why it works--it's great mechanics instead of half-assed mechanics that try to imitate something totally different, on top of a great theme and very strong character roles.  I'd say that it's superior to Runebound in essentially every way if you have four or six people to play with.  My main problem with the game is the mass PVP endgame, which is poorly done, and I don't think that it really serves the only intended purpose of making the game shorter at all.  I suggest playing with a final showdown versus the boss instead.  Also, it tends to be extremely fiddly, just like so many roleplaying-themed games.

One of the worst game I have ever played. 2 to 4 players is not real, that's a 2 players game. Even if you play 4 players, there's always one that take decision for both. It's a computer game that did not adapted well to the board, it's stayed the same way: an individual game. Your opponents play doesn't interfere yours... What's the point of playing then.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Is it long?  Yes.  Is it huge?  You bet.  Is it fun?  I sure seem to think so.  The leveling aspect that your characters go through and the growth (equipment, levels, skills) make this game worth the play through.  It can feel like each player is playing solitaire until the very end, though, which is the game's only downfall, but I still really like it.  I rate this one above the WoW Adventure game.

Too long for the pay-off. Down time is a killer. Played other, more fun games with my partners while opponents' took their turns. Probably much more fun for players of the pc game, but this one won't win me over. Modified rules for play on 9/7/7, but still took way too long for my taste. Down time not as much of a killer this time, though. Will play again, but my rating stands.

Nice components and innovative combat system, but its so boring and repetitive...
You just go from an area of the boardgame to another killing monsters and the other players do the same with little interaction. 
The dice management for the combat system is something that one would love or hate (in my case, is hate).

A solid, clever game but lacks genuine decision making. You level up then you win or lose depending on how quickly your opponent levels up. While there seems to be a lot of variety that is an illusion as the choices are either obvious or do not make much difference.

RATING: 7
Fun RPG-style game. Some of the cards are in Czech and FFG lost its license so I can't get replacement cards. Pulling out Google translations adds an unusual element to tthe game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For a partnership (4 or 6 players) dungeon crawl adventure game this is really great.  Play it as a cooperative game and it is a lot of fun.  With only two players the utter lack of interaction is probably a killer.  The advancement, gold, experience, everything works well and really feels like a fantasy MMO RPG.  

The combat system, with different dice for different types of attacks, and several monster attributes is really clever.  This is where the game shines.  The bits are also top notch, the minis look great and everything is top quality.  None of the many cards had confusing text and overall the rules were better than average for FFG.

The game seemed to have a pretty serious rich get richer snowball effect.  I'm not sure how they could fix that, but it might be nice for there to be some sort of small pity bonus for when one team gets way ahead of the other, like being able to clean up the other guy's encounters of your level, something like that to give the team that is behind some easy kills.  

Overall this is a very good fantasy adventure game and I am surprised it is rated lower than runebound and talisman because I vastly preferred this.

RATING: 6
I'm not an adventure gamer, but did not mind this game at all.  It is a tad long, but being a wargamer, 4  hours is standard.  Although there can be some downtime when one player is engaged in combat, I find there is always something to do, so it's not boring down time.  The components are excellent, and the mechanics work well.  The game oozes with theme.

The combat system may appear bizarre at first, but after you've played through one, it becomes intuitive.

The PvP aspect is something I do not particularly care for, as I feel it does not add to the game, but was added so it mimics the on-line game.

I still believe this to be one of my favorite games although I can't feel right giving it a 10 as it rarely gets played due to long setup and long play time.  Old comments below still apply.

When my fiancee bought me this game, she had no idea what she was getting herself into.  As someone who avidly played WoW and raided throughout the Burning Crusade, I couldn't get enough of the game.  The same applies here.  I think our group played this every week after I had gotten it for a couple months.  It was fun seeing all the quests, the classes, the items, the monsters, the bosses, etc.  Each playthrough was different, with switching teams and all of the variety.  It held relatively faithful to the PC game, which made it pretty easy to pick up on, despite the huge rule book (a rule book with its own index constitutes as a long book to me).  Probably the only reason I didn't give it a 10 is that it certainly is an isolated game - it's hard to find new people who want to undertake a 5+ hour game, and often hard to find time these days to play it even with people who want to play it.  The setup/takedown time can be pretty tremendous as well.  Once it's setup though, and you have a group of people who really want to play, this is an excellent game, even if you're not into the PC game.

I LOVE this game.  It is a BLAST to play, but do NOT play it with the default PvP rules.  Use the optional "Deadly PvP" rules from the back of the rulebook.  Otherwise, prepare for 90+ minutes of rolling 50 dice to MAYBE do 1 or 2 points of damage to the other faction. 
Edit:  3 more plays over Christmas weekend.  This game is unbelievably fun.  The only reason it isn't rated higher is because the better PvP rules are considered "optional".  Also, the game is LOONNNNNNGGGGG.... it is hard to convince a group to play a 4+ hour epic like this.  If it could be shortened, it would be amazing...

This has become one of my very favorite solo games.  I play with one of the variants published here, with a few tweaks of my own to make it extra challenging.  I'd say my win percentage is about 55%.  It's very engaging and I find the game to be really well balanced for the most part.  There are always many different pathways to a successful character build depending on the Overlord, the available equipment, etc. which keeps it quite fresh.

Sadly like many AT games from FFG I find this game lacking. It has several clever mechanics, battle resolution, build trees and many others, but ultimately it is sorely lacking when it comes to the victory conditions and the competition of a game. This would be a far more successful game if it was co op, the currect race to finish the game/team aspect eliminates all effective competition anyway (making it almost a team solitaire). It would seem far better to just have everyone play together and make the game much tougher to beat.

Great game, but if you break it out, don't make any other plans. I've only played this with two people, but have yet to have a game that lasted under 2 days. When you hit "end-game" levels, each turn can take up to half an hour depending on gear, buffs, and the usual WOW-modifiers. If you can maybe figure out how to short-track the game a bit, this game would be a wicked keeper.

Changed my rating from 6 to 7 to 7.5 to 8. I can see why many people really hate this game (takes ages to play, ages of downtime and so on) but it really grows on you. The battle system is fiddly, but brilliantly fits the theme and the character management. Downtime gets less after a while and for those of us who are into micromanagement, its simply a blast. Hesitate to recommend it to anyone else, but am glad to own it myself (as well as the expansions).

I pre-ordered this game to get the special Night Elf Druid figure. It's a very nice piece and I'm glad I have it. Wish I had them all.

The game, while fun, can drag on a bit. I can see myself really enjoying the game with other people that play WoW and don't mind long games. Otherwise, it's going to be a tough game to get played. I can never see myself playing this with my Euro gaming group.

Great game for World of Warcraft fans. The cards and items really fit into the whole idea. I loved tweaking my character. The combat system is kind of interesting but is mostly just rolling dice. The characters are different though and it is kind of fun to see how they play out and how their dice pools end up. I thought the dice pools accurately reflected the MMORPG characters. Combat is very fiddly though and we found ourselves doing most of it in our head.

If you like World of Warcraft and have a group of friends you can play with, go for it! It'll be a long night of fun. If not, pass on it.

The game isn't a complex as it would seem at first, especially considering the huge rulebook. It reminds me of Runebound a bit, they are both essentially dungeon crawls after all. There are things I prefer in Runebound such as the different merchant decks that actually get regular restocks compared to Warcraft's community merchant deck that rarely gets anything new. I have money, I want to buy something awesome!  Not be left with the same old tired level 1 items that I sold to you in the first place!!!  Other than that, I REALLY like the quest system and the combat system. The movement system can't even be compared, give me straight up movement anyday. All in all, I really enjoy the game and would easily recommend it to anyone with a few hours to spare.

The game pretty much delivers what is promises (like Bin Ladin in a blender :p ): lots of munchkin fun. The character development is one of best I've seen anywhere, but I have to admit the rest of the game is kinda bland. But once again, incredible visuals and plastic miniatures won me over. It is kinda long, and very random, but I don't mind those things so much. My rating may go up, but I really don't think it will go down. :) (I have never played the videogame, BTW).

***UPDATE***
Well it finally got from 7 to 8. The game has really grown on me. It is even more fun playing with my VP variant.

***UPDATE***
Well, I got the expansion, and now I don't feel that the base game deserves an 8 by itself.

***UPDATE***
Well, now I have finally played the videogame quite a bit, and I find that the boardgame adaptation has some very weird things and some other that are simply better than their original counterparts, like monsters and ability customizing.

Seriously, I doubt I'm gonna play this again unless I find a way to make it fully coop. I'm just not waiting 25 minutes for my turn again, just to move 4 regions and go back to waiting 20 minutes... D:

Furthermore, The WoW: Adventure Game can kinda fill my WoW boardgaming need.

Another big box game.  Comes with scads of cards and minis.  Unfortunately, the pace seems much too hurried, and it's a game you'll have to set aside a whole evening for.  Still good enough to warrant a 9/10 though, so that should say soemthing.

It looks pretty, but has shallow gameplay hidden behind all those chits and figures.
Lots of racing around the board leveling up, with no real incentive to do much else and no real sense of accomplishment when you do.  The faction players work together closely, but the two factions require random events to have any motive for interaction.
It's basically a re-themed Runebound with alot more chits.

My personal copy is unplayed and it may never be played. I shouldn't have bought it but...could not resist....would love to break it out.

I think it will grow on my though as I really liked it in the demo I played before it's release. You really build your guys up. Plus: Boss baddies and quests. It achieves quite a bit actually.

I get all the complaints about this game. I agree with many of them. For anyone who has ever played the MMO, though, the depth you can achieve in this game despite its limitations is pretty good. I like the character advancement and the amount of gear and talents really make you feel like you're playing a character class from the MMO.

Great big box full of fantastic bits.  Works nice as a 2-on-2 team game.  However, almost too many rules for this sort of thing - combat is endlessly micromanaging how many dice you are allowed to roll and re-roll in a given combat round.  Fun is almost outweighed by fatigue after 4 hours.

First impressions:  200 miniatures on a board the size of a postage stamp.

Looks like FF should have taken a tip from Eagle Games and made the board a LOT bigger.

I'm a fan of the Computer games, but I think that this will fall far short of providing the same experience.

RATING: 7
I want to like this more but can't, though a 7 isn't bad per se.
1)  The blue independent creatures are randomly annoying.
2)  Many event cards are often overlooked in lieu of better quest monsters.
3)  The items you really want are rarely available.
4)  PVP is typically not worth the actions required to slow down the other faction.

In other words, you can't 'really' beef your character the way you'd like to.  This isn't necessarily a flaw as the big baddies still die with adequate characters.  But I'd like to have more control in item selection, routing away from independents, and event cards worthy of actions.

Again, a 7 warrants many more plays by me, but I see potential for an even better game with further playtesting.

RATING: 8
Have played once, Is pretty much what I expected a fun epic game.
I like this one a bit more than Descent, rules a little more straight forward not so much guessing - in my opinion.

Have now played more than once, game still holds true.

**After further plays, playing with 4-6 players I have come to the realization that this is only a 2-4 player game (2-3 players play with 4 characters).  Playing with 4 characters should be the max. this game is way to G*D D**N long for 5-6 players (6 characters) also way to convoluted to many characters and equipment and minitures to manage to make the game fun.  Still love the game though (with 4 characters).**

There's a good game in here somewhere, which is a typical comment I have with CTP's games.  Half-baked is another frequent term that I would apply.  My first issue with the game is the extreme down-time, which is mostly the game's fault, but partly the fault of the gamers with me.  My second issue with the game is the PvP aspect; I think the game would have been better as a total co-op game.  Just my opinions, of course.

Very long but very epic. The character build up is what makes this game. Gives a very strong WOW feel in the different characters.

RATING: 6
Straightforward game of killing, looting and leveling up. I admit a weakness for the zillions of cards and the variety in character customizations they offer. The sheer amount of stuff to pick through and keep track of teeters on the brink of overload. The combat system, while a little cumbersome, does make sense. Don't expect a deep game experience.

Cons: The playtime is long for what this game is. Also, while the combat system works fine against monsters, it bogs down in player versus player. 

In short, I like the game, but don't love it. It's not really worth the space it takes on my shelf nor the time it takes to play.

If you are going to buy this game, go ahead and purchase the Shadow of War as well. It makes the game better.

RATING: 7
Rating is based on a single play.  I was able to draw the parallels between this and Runebound right away but I feel that WoW is a much better game all-around.  I was hesitant to give this game what most people would consider a low rating (6.5) because it's a very solid enjoyable game, but I did for a couple of reasons:    

1. It's a really long game.  I'm just not into multi-hour games like I used to be.  

2. I was pretty surprised at the complete lack of interaction between Horde and Alliance members.  I played this at Gencon with a friend (we both ended up on Horde) and by the time the game ended we'd barely talked to the players on the Alliance side and didn't even know their names.  Gaming's a social experience for me so that caught me completely off-guard.  

3. Unfortunately, this game shares a bit of Runebound's "downtime" phenomenon and even outdoes that game in the downtime department sometimes.  If the other team is deliberate in their play, be prepared to wait a while between turns.  

Update:  6-17-07

The above-mentioned stuff bothers me much much less currently and once I get over the fact that we eat six hours every time we play, I love every minute of it.  Bumping up to a 9.

Update:  1-19-08

I still enjoy the game on some levels, but at times I'm slightly disappointed when this comes out onto the table because it's such a long game that I know it means our gaming group will likely not be playing much else that particular day.  Dropping the rating to a 7 based on this.

I really want to enjoy this game, but the characters are [b]too imbalanced. What kills this game is the downtime.[/b]

This seems to be an overlong exercise in trying to level up your character. Some parts are really good, like the combat system, and the character advancement design.

But this is really a 4 or 6 player game. A player who controls 2 characters can't devote enough attention to his character, and I find that it slows down the game. And why couldn't they use a Health and Energy Track instead of all those fiddly tokens?

Never played a game that is less than 5 hours.  Never played it with people who have all played it before either.  Its maybe a bi-annual to annual thing at best.

I love it, just don't love the time it takes to play it.

*addendum*  Recently added the Shadow of War expansion and have gotten some more plays in, including with people that have played it before.  Still too much downtime, but the worst is the victory condition is too unsatisfying.  Fights against the final boss can take 30 minutes while the other side wonders if it should be putting its stuff away or if it will actually get a chance to play again.

Need a VP style variant for future plays I'm thinking, so that both teams are essentially always in it.

Hardest game for me to rate lately.
The game gets a 9 until the last turn.
The endgame gets a 3.  Just awful.  I hate it and it detracts significantly from my overall enjoyment and ranking.
Because of this, I'd rather play Runebound (which is very good in its own right).  Sad, because this could have been GREAT.
Sigh.
Update:  pulled down rating again recently.  Just too long to know that the end-game crap is looming ahead.  Great beginning and mid-game, however...too bad, that.

This game suffers from a real lack of player interaction. It's like two games going on at the same time. One for Horde, and one for the Alliance. Not much to write home about. Maybe it would be better with the max amount of players. Just to have some interaction between players, at least with the ones on your own side... *Sigh* On top of that, it takes a freakin' day to finish this game. I like optimization games. Just not so one-dimensional. Despite everything written above, I'm willing to give this game another chance. But only with 6 players... Beautiful components and art by the way. :D

RATING: 7
A bit too long for me. But pretty thematic. We often find ourselves that the factions are just chasing and bashing each other hard for pure fun of PvP without any consideration of the Overlord... 

The Hungarian Version published by Deltavision suffers badly from the lack of proofreading. Inconsistent usage of game terms, sentences without any meaning or even grammar, errors on cards... 
The GS guys responsible for the translation must have been lazy, and had never played the game. Not on the board at least.

This is a cooperative fantasy adventure game (with two teams of opposing players) with a heavy focus on character building. The combat system is complex and time-consuming, but the game always seems to please. The goal is to be the first team to defeat the overlord. The time required to play this game is significant. A great game, but you need time and a group of players who can appreciate the complexity.

Mmmm, one of my "gateway games" to Thematic board games.  I loved WoW the video game and I do really enjoy WoW: The Board Game.  Its biggest flaws are well-known:

1. Takes a long time to play

2. Lots of down time

3. Minimal interaction between teams

I love it despite all of that.  It's combat and character customization are 2nd to none and it really creates an awesome game with a huge amount of re-playability.  Still, due to its flaws it is not something that hits my table very often.

Played once (no expansions). I think I would like this better as a solo or cooperative game with only one side. Not much interaction between Alliance and Horde. The other team seemed pretty extraneous, except for throwing a few blue creature in our way. Having the other team didn't really seem to add much except length of gameplay. I know there's PvP, but from reading the rules and comments online, it didn't seem worth it, and during the actual game there was little opportunity for confrontation between the teams.

The combat system was creative and interesting, but slow in the larger battles as each player consulted their character sheet, reached for all of the dice, rolled, consulted their character sheet again, activated powers, rerolled, spotted, placed damage tokens, etc.

First game took 6  hours, which would be too long if it were an average game length. I could tolerate a ~4 hour game (assuming I could find time in my schedule, which is a different issue).

Fantasy adventure game in which you essentially try to upgrade your character by completing quests with the goal of a final showdown against the big baddie. Strategy is rather limited, as you have no impact on where the quests appear. Interaction with the other faction is minimal (although you could start battling with the other faction and ignore the dragons and other monsters, but that kind of goes against the spirit of the game - in my opinion). Within the own faction, partnerships are practically mandatory to defeat groups and I don't really like this kind of mechanism in a game. The combat system has some interesting ideas and I quite liked how the different types of dice (based on character cards) interacted to determine the result of the battle and the wounds inflicted by the monster, although the whole process requires a bit of administration. In the end, the game simply takes too long to avoid becoming tedious, but nevertheless (and this may seem a contradiction) our first play actually ended too soon after 8 hours, as none of the factions had even the slightest chance to defeat the Overlord Nefarian (all the "two"'s had come out at about mid-game of the 30 turns). The first half of the game was fun and a shorter game might have a lot more appeal.

Together with the expansion "shadows of war" this game is really fun. It can get a bit boring after some time because of the limited game structure... that is in general: beat a creature and take its stuff. Well, they could have created more individual quests. But like the online game this WoW lacks of quests other than "search and kill". The expansion tried much to change this - not by quests but by new stuff and many skills/powers to develop your character. At all this game can´t be rated higher - because of its very limited structure. But I have never seen a boardgame with a more detailed character development and such funny player interaction. And that´s worth much. Runebound on the other hand has much more storyline, more different quests and more cool background - but has not that cool character development like WoW and really lacks a "character story".

I really like the game, but it takes a bit too long and has a long setup-time (not to mention putting-everything-neatly-back-in-the-box-including-the-expansions time).
Bought second hand: It's in very good condition, but I am missing the human Paladin figure (but since that's Alliance and I don't play Alliance, that's no real problem). EDIT: Have bought the Paladin at Essen 2014.
Also, I think it would've been better if the monsters were displayed on the reference sheet with drawn artwork (like the heroes) instead of their videogame models.
2017: Sold. It's a good game, but never hit the table.

RATING: 8
At the core, this is a classic "build your character up for the end battle" style of game play. What really makes it so unique is the large amount of character building options. The board and quests are fun but nothing outstanding there. This is a game mostly about the talents and toys an individual can find, and the combo's they produce. Adventure games are my forte so my high rating really comes from my intense love of this style of play. However, I could understand why some traditional gamers may look past the chrome and feel underimpressed. I HIGHLY recommend this to adventure and fantasy lovers--if you do not consider yourself in one of these two categories, you may wish to look elsewhere.

I think the rules for this game should be redesigned in some way. PvP is boring and almost non-existant, and the game way too long and there is a lot of downtime per faction. 

Shame.  I really wanted to like this game. The character development system and PvE battle is golden, though. Otherwise, the rules are a bit broken.

RATING: 3
I think it's one of the worst huge fantasy flight board games.  The concept is not so bad, but the game flows really badly. It feels also very much like solitaire multiplayer. In fact, which faction you fight for has somewhat no meaning to the game, they could have made sure than you can team up with anybody you want during the play, and change whenever you like, and it would have made the game even more interesting.

There are a few interesting points to the game but they generally come with their drawbacks. The concept of character powering up is interesting, but sometimes there is just too much. To much power to chose from and  complicated combination. For example, level uping gives you 1 special power you cannot get otherwise. But you get to chose one  of the 8 abilities for that level and each level add another 8 abilities to chose from. Putting 3 or 4 power would have been far enough.

Sometimes you can also do weird combinations with special powers which makes it really painfull to resolve. So another bad effect is that the game is very long and there is a lot of downtime because when other players do stuff, you just do nothing and wait, not much thing to do while waiting either.

There was a good combat system ideas using dices of different colors but it was hard to understand. Of of the reason is because the 3 monster colors and the 3 dice colors are the same. So when you see the colors, you don't know if they talk about the dice or the creature.

I would also say that this game has the worst cross referencing problem ever seen. Every creature on the board has a card off board to give extra information about why this creature is there. Awfull.

So this game was just a failure, they needed to make the game flow much faster, increase player interactions and speed up battles.

firstly, i've never played the video game of this namesake.  after one playing of this, i see why it was a video game and not on boardgame format.  the game play itself is fine, but my knock on it is the downtime and the long length of play (and i like long games but of a more complex variety).  also,  i suspect there may be a runaway leader problem since all monsters have fixed values (leading team could pounce on lagging team to keep them down & out).  to me, for what this is, it drags on too long for my taste.

The only things that keep this game from being perfect are the sometimes very large amounts (1-20+ minutes... generally 2-6 minutes with 2 players) of waiting beetween player turns, and the 5+ hours of playtime required.  (Includes spaced out time for being stoned.)  If yo uhave a few friends willing to put in the time, it can be one of the most epic experiences you can get from a board game, with all sorts of WoW represented in all sorts of ways, and a brilliant combat system.  (Except for the PvP, but the expansions make it a bit better)  Add the expansions and I give this one a 9, with the time issues again being the only possible flaw.  It can be played with up to 6 people, but I've have the most fun with 2.

For those familiar with MMO style games this title lends as much of that feel as a boardgame can I suppose. The game is very tight, it seems you have pretty much just enough time to level your group up enough to be able to have any kind of chance against the Big Bad Evil Guy and then go challenge it. The main thing going against this game is the downtime. While the other team is taking their turn you're planning yours but then while they discuss their new options you're pretty much just sitting there.

[Played 34 times]
+) I like the fantasy setting and the team aspect, but interaction with the other faction is low (only some occasional PvP).
+) I like how you build the characters (customizing them).
-) I dislike that the gameplay isn't much varied (go there, defeat the foes, get the reward).
+) The "replay value" is decent (it's one of those games you don't want to play several times in a row, but once in a while it's always fine) and can be improved by the expansions
+) Interesting and original combat system.
-) Luck has a very important role.
-) Game lenght is significant.
-) Downtime (while the other faction plays) was acceptable but not negligible with 2 or 3, almost acceptable with 4 and unbearable with 5 or 6.
+) A fully cooperative variant (with some slightly altered rules) is playable and works fine. It is indeed the best way to play the game, in my opinion (but I like a lot purely cooperative games). Its rating would be a "6" if only the game "as it is out of the box" was considered.
+) Great components (bits, graphic), but high price tag.

Again, too fiddely and too long. The game devolves into a constant stream of too complex combat with too much down time. Player interaction MUST be avoided or both sides suffer for it so much that the game ends up feeling like two big games of solitaire. Character management is fun but can get too annoying to keep track of towards the end of the game.

RATING: N/A
Take on the role of a chivalrous paladin or a wise shaman, a holy priest or a vile warlock, a mighty mage or a crafty rogue. Play as a savage orc, a mighty tauren, a tribal troll, or one of the Forsaken undead; become an ingenious gnome, a doughty dwarf, a mysterious Night Elf, or a noble human.
Based on the popular World of Warcraft Massively Multiplayer Online Game from Blizzard Entertainment, World of Warcraft: the Board Game invites the players to choose from 16 characters, drawn from the eight races and nine character classes of the Warcraft universe, and take up arms for the glory of the Horde ... or the Alliance. Travel across Lordaeron, vanquish monsters, gain experience and power, and earn honor for your faction.
World of Warcraft: the Board Game is a team-based fantasy adventure. The Horde and the Alliance factions must compete to be the first to defeat the invincible Overlord – be it the lich-king Kel'Thuzad, the dragon Nefarian, or the demon Kazzak – or, failing that, to be the last faction standing when it comes to all-out war!

Big and beautiful for sure. The game it reminds me of most is, oddly enough, Magic Realm - a set number of actions per round, always more to do than you can and fights were losing is a very real possibility. Definitely a brilliant two-player game, and the one team game I played also worked great.

Great theme, great artwork, beautiful materiel, balanced game, good variety of characters, weapons, armors, items, spells, talents. 
Good play mechanics that it's similar to the online game. Where we have to fight the mobs to find new objects, weapons in the differents areas of the map, which makes the glory of this play. The goal is in fact is to beat a a very powerful boss or then to beat the other group of players and this in 30 turns. The engagements are done by entering the numbers of dice of each colors which your charts of equipment, weapons and spells. 
However to play this game you need a lot of space.

I love character progression (Runebound is my favorite game), and this game has it in spades. It surpasses Runebound in a few areas: the characters and their progressions are more robust, lots of equipment, strategic turn decisions, and the combat system/dice pool mechanic is fun to play. Plus it has all the great theme of WoW.

The game also shows off a fabulous "team" vibe. You really feel like you are working with your team to progress...and that was the one item I wasn't expecting. It absolutely promotes team play.

RATING: 7
A huge game, in terms of size and length of play. Very interesting character development, every character has its own skills/spells! Several types of enemies, but with slight variations of strength and numbers. Many quests, large number of rewarding items to snatch or buy, Novel and nice mechanics, but the downside may be therefore very complicated battles, that tend to get slightly out of control unless you fully control and understand your character traits and advantages. Of course that may be also advantage. Generally a really nice game, but a little too long for my liking.

RATING: 7
First of all, I have never played the WOW MMORPG. But I did play the original Warcraft RTS games on PC. I picked up a copy of World of Warcraft: The Boardgame from a friend who didn't want their copy anymore, in 2010. Up till now, June 2016, I think the game has only seen the table on 3 separate occasions. So that's an average of play every two years. And on at least one of those occasions, the game had to be called before an official victory condition was met. It just takes too long to play, the player interaction is not that great, albeit with some teamwork for the factions.

So why is it still sitting on my shelves? The components are excellent. Incredible miniatures and art. A unique combat system. One of the best character development and thematic cross-overs I have seen. 

I play it solo, or just as a co-operative game with 1-3 players, using the variant rules freely available on the web. I guess it will always be a bit of a guilty pleasure for me.

I have never played the computer game.  This game is out of print, I have been searching a while to buy it, because I like big games with lots of plastic figures (I am a big kid).  Rated 8 for solo play.  PROPER use of plano speed up the setup time to less than 10 minutes.  Combat is very fun, even if you throw a bucket of dices, you have many abilities and power that help mitigate the luck.  The level up is also one of the best I've seen in a boardgame.  It's really interesting to build your caracters and see if you can combo some abilities and how to improve for the next game.  The many classes, skills, bosses, and monsters, as well as many options from the expansions, make this a very enjoyable/replayable experience.  I would play coop with one friend, but not sure about PVP due to major downtime.  I would not recommend this game solely for the PVP aspect.  Solo is the way to go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The character development system is outstanding. Best in a pure board game that I have seen. The combat system works well with the development system (recommend both expansions).

We use a series of home rules to make this game work for our setting.  But it really works great.  We have continued to revise our system, but the core development and combat systems have remained unchanged throughout.

For better or worse this game does a great job of recreating the feeling of playing the World of Warcraft MMORPG.

This game has a lot of positives and negatives.  The components are nice, even though the board warps.  The game system itself is good although combat is very cumbersome.  If it is not your turn, there is way too much downtime.  We played with only 2 players - I cannot imagine the downtime with even more players.  I did not care for the PvP in the game at all.  There did not seem to be much of a point to it.  You really need to level your characters and wasting a turn for PvP seemed silly.  The endgame was a major let down for me.  I do not like the PvP part at all for end game.  The overlord winning condition is much more enjoyable.  However, then you essentially have a racing game between the 2 factions without a lot of necessary interaction.  Overall, the game was fun and had some great ideas.  I just wish the PvP and the end game did not bring down my perceptions.  This game will see some playing time but not as much as I would hope from an $80 game.  Descent and Doom are much better games.

I'd play this more often if it wasn't so long.  It pretty much takes a whole afternoon, so people need to know what they're in for.  A familiarity with the computer game will be a great help, but isn't neccessary.  A lot of dice rolling involved, with thematic skill trees, talents and equipment modifiers out the wazoo.  Resolving dice combat is the part that's initially the most complicated, but it's also where a lot of the fun comes from once it's understood.  With the right crowd it's fun for an occasional play, but you don't want to be playing this with the wrong crowd.

RATING: 5
This game while capturing the theme of classic WoW quite well, the execution of this game provides for a long, cumbersome experience that requires a massive table and time investment.  Expansions fix a few things like providing incentive to take down independent monsters and add things like Dungeons/raid Bosses to allow for an endgame that just isnt a pvp bloodbath.  What this ends up becoming is something we take out once a year for nostalgia and then realize during pickup why it doesnt come out more often.

The more players you have the more fun you will have. There is tons of interaction withen the factions. Very little interaction between factions... The combat system is a good touch. You have a little more say on how you distibute your damage rather than just rolling for hits.

Unlike pretty much everyone else, I came to know this game through a friend who bought it, and then because I loved it some much I gave WoW a chance (and loved it too). 

It's a very good game if you don't know WoW, it's pretty much a must have if you do: Great art, a lot of components, simple mechanisms that mimics really well the skills of the characters in the videogame, every class is as customizable as their digital counterparts... 

The only negative points are: 

The downtime. I for one actually enjoy looking at the other players while I'm waiting, how and what they do, so it's not a problem for me, but I can see how it is for most people.

The duration of each game. Again, it's something that doesn't bother me, but it I can understand some people having a problem with it, since it requires you to dedicate almost a whole afternoon to the game. 

The pvp. Everything aspect of WoW was translated beautifully into the game, but the pvp. It's too long and has no point, Again, I have little problem with this, since the point of the game is to portray mainly the pve aspect of WoW.

PROs:
(1) unique intriguing combat system (the best I've ever seen)
(2) theme, skills, and talents very close to the MMO
(3) great components

CONs:
(1) nearly no interaction between the teams
(2) very long downtimes
(3) character optimization (equipment, abilities, and talents) takes a long time... usually the whole downtime of the enemy team
(4) every team plays "their own separate game" (if you combine (2) and (3))
(5) characters are quite weak at the start -> quite luck based to get rolling
(6) imbalanced classes (hunter is the king of dice manipulation)

I'm a HUGE Blizzard fan.  I've been playing all their games when they launched from Lost Vikings, WC1-WoW, Diablo, and Starcraft.  I've logged over 40,000 hours (I kid you not, yes I'm aware it's sad!) in their video games sadly.  That said, I really wanted to like this game since I've always been a fan of the warcraft series and stories.

Too bad, I couldn't like this game.  WAY too much to keep track of.  I basically felt like I was playing the game with my team and the other team was doing their own thing.  They could have given themselves extra abilities/items/etc and I wouldn't have known (and it wouldn't have made a difference on top of that).

Interesting options when your character levels up but...map is wasted since it's so big but you're stuck to a small area in the beginning...then suddenly you're max level anyway.  Seems like the game would have been better as a campaign type game where you play small segments per session.

Combat is nice with the attack/defense mechanism....too bad it involves keeping track of all the skills and modifiers.  It gave me a headache everytime I had to roll and figure out what dice, how many, etc.  I wrote it down on paper and adjusted as I got new items/skills but it was so much bookkeeping. 


I think it can be a much higher rating and more fun if played over a few segments and people customized it with a campaign style play (changed leveling to be slower and such as well).  Right now it's just an overly complex dicefest.

This game as is would have worked better as a video game...oh wait it is a video game!  Go play WoW or Wc3: DOTA instead and leave this boardgame alone.  I would give it a lower rating but I'm a big fan of Warcraft and the skill options are nice.  The adventure game looks like it would be a lot more fun and in the spirit of warcraft, but I haven't gotten a chance to play that.

The game takes far too long with far too little interaction.  The combat system, though I like the fact it tries to capture the rock paper scissors of the actual computer game, is overly complicated and far too tedious.  17 or something steps to figure out whether your lvl 4 character can whomp a murloc is excessive.  The game bogs down to, ok... you guys play your turn, my team will be playing magic until you finish.

Wanted to like this one, but it really turned out to be six-player solitaire. Rarely did I even interact with the other players on my team, much less the other team. Also the combat system is bizarre, needlessly complex, and fiddly beyond all get out. I think they were trying to create a system that would handle damage-over-time, at least the way it works in the MMORPG, but all it did is make a bunch of token shuffling weirdness.

A weighty epic of a game that takes as long to set up as some games take to play (especially when throwing in all of the expansions).  Still, given the right crowd of committed gamers, and enough time and space to play, I'd certainly play again.  I enjoy the customization options for your characters - two people playing the same character might have completely different looking character sheets by the end.  I also like the team vs. team mechanic of cooperation combined with competition - just the right decision for a game like this.  I think four players is probably the sweet spot.  I'd probably suggest playing with the extra character options from the first expansion, and maybe the dungeons from the second, but no other expansions, just to limit complexity and time involved.

I'm so glad I tracked this game down. I was a big WoW player from its initial release through Burning Crusade, and this game helps me return to a time when the game was actually fun. It's a little disappointing that the game board only covers Northern Lorderon, but it does cover a lot of the more famous monsters and character classes. At the end of the day, this is yet another dice-chucking game that is fairly solitaire-ish between the two teams, but growing your character and completing quests is where this game's fun really shows. The minis are ridiculous for their time, and the amount of components is amazing. I'm really happy with this game, and it has caused me to track down the expansions as well. If only this didn't take all day to play, it could seriously be in my top 20 of all time.

Am slightly in the market for a Talisman-like game that's better than the overly luck-based and overly monopoly like Talisman. Runebound is another contender but I have doubts about both for price-to-worthwhile reasons and worries over pacing and downtime.

RATING: 9
This game takes up a LOT of space - and has a LOT of dice rolling - and combat can bog down a bit.  That said, the character development mechanism is VERY cool, and once you can do combat without consulting the rules (which was about halfway through our first game) the combat system is pretty cool too.  There's a fair amount of stuff to like here.  The endgame PvP seems a bit contrived, but as our first game pushed four hours it was a welcome (and climactic) end nevertheless.

Rating is based on urge to play again, and reflects the maximum rating I see WoW getting from me.  It only goes down from here.


---edit---
After 5 plays it is a solid 8.  Loses points for length but gets them back for being as clever as it is.  A little imagination goes a long way towards drawing the theme out of the fairly simple combat mechanics.  Excellent system.

---update--
Up a point!  The combat system is too awesome to earn anything less than a 9, IMO.  With only five basic concepts (red, blue, and green dice, reroll, and attrition) the designers have successfully captured the feel of a myriad of different fantasy effects.  Fantastic!

I've only played this twice so far, so my rating is likey to change.  Not quite sure whether it'll be going up or down though.  

The game's got some nice ideas and the components are great.  However, there's a lot of downtime and it feels kinda like the two teams are playing two completely seperate games.  It also takes an awful long time to play and all the quests feels a bit samey.

I'm sure that after a few more games under our belts my group will find that the gameplay speeds up quite a bit, which will help reduce the long downtime aspect.  However, I also get the feeling that we may get bored of this pretty quickly.

I think if you're only going to go for one big box Fantasy Flight game for Christmas, go for Descent.

Edit: I'd like to say I've had a chance to play this game further and re-evaluate my thoughts on it but the fact is none of my group can be bothered playing this.  That says something in itself.  It just takes way too long for what it is.

I feel the custom character stat building and combat mechanics in this game are very novel and well done, probably some of my favorites of any fantasy adventure board game out there. Setting up your character's abilities are practically its own meta game in itself.

The downsides however are that for a game based on an MMO involving questing all over the countryside doing a variety of things the board game really just hones in on the monster killing part. I'd love to have seen more variety in the quests that add some of the real narrative meat WoW has a deep well of, but sadly its just chopping monsters in the face with swords all day.

Overall I feel its still a solid game if want something with a nice character customization element and aren't looking for grand story arcs to keep you drawn in.

Good solo adventure.  Think more an adventure of fighting bad guys and collecting money and stuff, buy more stuff to help fight tougher bad guys.  Rinse and repeat until you fight the end boss.  More of an experience than a game perhaps?

People say it's very long and has boring wait time if playing with others.  Playing solo gets rid of wait time and cuts down the length in general, especially if you don't take forever planning and just keep fighting the closest quests on your way to the end boss.

My biggest problem is that I wished monsters/bad guys could follow you down.  Would make it more tense instead of just waiting until you can take stuff out.

Rating is in a holding pattern for now;  only 2 games played.  There are some very strong, tight elements to the game, but an overall so-what factor creeps in.  Game is long and heavy on components and fiddling about--and combats are just a giant dicefest, no decision making.  So the only interest comes from Quest cards (random) and player decisions on which to go after and when/if to PvP.  

Great presentation, tightly developed--but overly long game for what you do get to decide.  The game could probably be improved dramatically with either or both expansions or more streamlined play and combat procedures.

Good fantasy boardgame.  Reminds me of Talisman.  Rules are written fairly well but don't expect to just open the box and start playing.  Take a couple hours and read all 30 pages and pay attention to the examples.  I've read complaints about down time... doesn't happen in our games.  Must be the people playing.Lots of stuff in box.  A little too fiddly but not so much so that it detracts from the game.  Space can be an issue.Our games have been lively and fun.  Takes awhile to figure out what's going on for new players but after a few battles everything begins to make sense and the games take off.  I expect this game to become more enjoyable after mastering the rules and look forward to the expansions FFGs plan to produce.

Played once, two player.  Had a blast.  What I want an adventure game to be.  Would love to have a way for it to work in an environment with more players but a bit less 'team' so that you can really identify with one character but not just be adding a negotiation phase.

I enjoyed the game. I wished there was a little more direct interaction between the Horde and the Alliance sides in the game. Specifically a reason for doing so. Always seemed better to just grind them levels out instead of taking time to find the enemy. Hey, it IS World of Warcraft! Maybe the expansions beyond Shadow of War help in this regard but that is another reason I parted with the game. I'm a completest and it was getting prohibitively expensive to keep up with expansions when there were other games that caught my interest. I'd be down for a game if the situation presented itself!

Il 90% di chi gioca a D&D potrebbe passare direttamente a questo gioco: si combattono i mostri, ci si aiuta in combattimento, si fa esperienza, si raccoglie e si divide bottino e soldi, il tutto senza bisogno di interpretare il personaggio. Le regole del gioco sono abbastanza semplici: un gruppo contro l'altro contro il terzo incomodo, fino allo scontro finale; nel frattempo si tirano secchi di dadi. Il gioco unisce un'ottima grafica (e ottimi componenti) a tanti gadget da collezionare, scambiare, vendere. Il sistema di combattimento - un po' macchinoso - è in fin dei conti divertente. Carine anche le "trasposizioni" boardgame-istiche del passaggio di livello, dell'uso dei talenti agli incantesimi. Le caratteristiche uniche dei mostri mettono un po' più di pepe al combattimento, e la loro distribuzione rende vario lo scontro. Mi sono piaciuti molto meno altri aspetti: se da una parte promuovo il gioco per le dinamiche "intra-gruppo" (divertenti), lo boccio per la pochissima interazione tra le due fazioni. Si giocano in pratica due partite differenti, dove ognuno fa il suo per guadagnare esperienza, oggetti, talenti. Mentre gli altri giocano, il tuo gruppo pensa alla prossima strategia o a come posizionare gli oggetti, ma soprattutto combattere l'avversario (umano) non è per niente incentivato: niente esperienza, qualche soldo e qualche oggetto (facendo le quest rischi meno, fai ugualmente soldi e oggetti ma fai anche punti esperienza). Inoltre, un po' come a risiko, non c'è un'alternativa efficace al combattimento, che è l'unico strumento per raggiungere l'obiettivo. Poi un'annotazione personalissima: seppur eccellente dal punto di vista grafico, il tabellone mi sembra un po' "senz'anima". Insufficiente già di per sé, abbasso ulteriormente il voto perché dura un'infinità.

March 2010: Disappointed with this bad boy. Loved WoW back in the day, played a couple years at launch. This game, although pretty fun, has too many components for me, and I can't play super long games anymore due to lack of giant chunks of free time. Also, tons of dice and a giant unwieldy box. Anyone want to trade for it? Scoring 5.8 for complete incompatibility with my life.

Despite that it still usually feels that time runs out and you can't accomplish anything really.
A LOT more enjoyable then the PC-game, believe me...

First solo game played with both expansions but only map from base game. Ridiculuous amounts of personalisation per character with talents, spells and equipment. Interesting. I can see why people call it a race game. How fast can I shift to harder quests? Go alone or with 2 char. Etc. 
The Boss Nefarian had some stupid movement rules which means the game is some turns shorter. But my 2 char beat him only one turn too late (turn 27).
The warlock was amazing with 8 blue, 9 red and 2 green dice at lvl 4. The druid had healing though which saved them during the first turn of battle.

2nd solo game. The Rogue was fun. A lot of red dice and many of them could be manipulated into 8's. The Paladin was like in the PC game not much to have :) But I did not specialize in any healing whatsoever and it worked well anyhow against the undead lich boss. Fun but a bit slow game.

Played once as a co-op. Character building is fantastic, and the dice-management combat is cool too. The problem is that these are both pretty solitary exercises, so even though there were 3 of us playing, I felt like I was basically on my own the whole game, even though I had to spend 1/2 my time waiting for the other players to do their rolls. The repetitiveness of the quests (move, kill, move, kill, ...) also yields less of an adventure than games like Runebound or Arkham Horror where you draw an encounter card once you get somewhere.

Tried to play; after two and a half hours, quit because each side had taken exactly two turns.  I have never in my life seen such great downtime issues, and almost completely unnecessarily.  Very, very fiddly, most notably in combat.  I doubt I will ever feel the need to try this game again.

RATING: 7
Well, this game is about as close to a video game as a board game can get.  I like it because of the level up feature of the game.  Kill monsters, get xp, level up, get new skills (which are different depending on your class/character and there are so many to choose from you can do totally differnt stuff on different games with the same character), and you can buy stuff or win stuff to equip as weapons as well.  There is a strong team building experience in this game, because you need a tank and a mage or whatever to round out your team.  If you're a magic user and you start out trying to be on your own, you will get your butt kicked without help.  I love all this about the game, and I love that you can even play by yourself since the battle system is very unique and completely run off of a stat sheet.  The bad things about it are that faction turns last FOREVER.  If you are playing a six person game, your team will sit on their butts staring at the floor for like 10 minutes while the other team does their turn.  I almost prefer to do this solo for that reason, although that's a bit pathetic.  Also, since the game is on a time track, you really don't have much time to screw around.  The game tries to foster exploration and offers a large world map, but when you have only so much time to level up and fight the boss, you really have to move to planned out destinations and you can't afford to die more than twice or you'll lose too much time.

Very similar to Runebound in design but fiddly and not as fluid. Very, very long play time. Each turn is battle, battle, battle with little progress made (this is one long game). Though the system is a Runebound clone, the game executes much more like Nexus Ops without the clean, short system of Nexus Ops. Nice bits (and there are a lot of them) but half way through the game I was considering how many different ways I could melt, cut or mutilate the units. I figure one trip through the lawn mower should handle most. In short - long, over priced, repetative...I don't think I care for it.

One partial game to turn 16.

I was invited by a co-worker to sit in for a game on a recent Saturday afternoon.  6 players, 3 of whom had played once before. I went in expecting to hate this, and when the setup and explanations took an hour I was overcome with a feeling of bleak foreboding and dread. I lost count of how many different decks of cards there were, but it was somewhere between 16 and 47. 

After 3 turns I noticed that we were doing the combat wrong. Easily fixed, but all through the game we had to constantly go back to the manual. 

My main impression of the game is that the choices you have are all fairly obvious. Most of the game is spent trying to cross reference the powers on the various cards. Some cards only work if another specific card is equipped, then a 3rd card may modify one of the 1st two cards. You can literally spend 5 minutes just figuring out how many dice to roll for one attack. I felt like I was taking a bar exam. The people I was playing with seemed to confuse all that reading with actual dicision making. 

There is a HUGE amount of downtime during the other faction's turn. Sure you can plan when it's not your turn, but even then it's still long. Me and  a team-mate actually started a game of Memoir '44 that we played when it wasn't our turn. 

Oh, and there was ZERO interaction between the teams except for one event card that let you move the independant monsters to interfere with your opponent's quests. 

Last main problem: our game lasted over 4 hours, and we only made it about 1/2 way through. 

Even with all these problems, I still wound up getting caught up in trying to level-up my character. If this game clocked in at 2-3 hours, I'd give it a solid 8, but for it's near-excruciating length, it gets a 4.

A strong game that excels in character building. The first time we finished in about 4 hours with 4 brand new players but we were able to finish in turn 21 of 30.

As a big fan of the MMO, this game perfectly implements the "feel" of the game mechanics, spells, and artwork.

P.S. Plus all the miniatures to paint!

For a light/medium RPG board game it's the real deal.  Character building is where this game shines...with all of the items/talents it's a pretty good bet you can play it multiple times and it still feel pretty new.  I like the competitive aspect and the art/components are great. Unfortunately probably won't appeal to my non-gamer friends...a bit too complicated and long.  Still, the built-in time limit will insure it does end.  The combat system is clever, but figuring out all the dice you can roll and how your abilities afect them can be a bit mind-numbing...especially if you're controlling more than one character.  I'd play it over Runebound anyday...I'm just not sure my friends would!

First impressions after one 6-player game that took 5 hours. The game has really nice component but unfortunately there is not so much game here. The main issues I am having with this game so far: huge downtime when opposing team is acting, which you cannot "use" for your planning since your next move is quite obvious and at the same time the actions of the opposing team are not interesting to follow since they have no impact on your desicions to take. After the first couple of turns it feels repetetive since all you do is go there, kill monster, collect treasure, advance hero (there some thought is required) and start all over again. I don't have any problems with games that last 5/6 hours, but in this case the huge downtime and the little planning/decision taking make me feel like there is too little game for such a long playing time. 
I like the combat system but even that feels a little clumsy with all the record keeping and checking whether some special bonus apply.
Frankly speaking I am not so sure whether I will be able to bring myself to play this game again and usually I will play any game at least twice.

This game had a lot of promise, but there's one very large and important factor left out which makes it not fun...

The bad:
The biggest factor of why this isn't a good game is because downtime is horrible in this game.  Especially with new players, you literally have to wait for the other team to carry out their sometimes very complex turns before you can do anything again.
Overly complex in too many places.  I usually like complex games, but this one has some really fiddly mechanics that will frustrate you even if you have played it many times.
Too many things to keep track of.  On top of some of the elements being overly complex, there are just too many items you need to keep track of at one time.  You have like a million spells, some feats, some equipped cards, potions, have to keep track of special effects on any one of the 4 territories which have to indicators.  There's a bunch of quick reference cards for stats and such, but that's on top of the other things.
The game board is a lot larger than it needed to be, it's hard to find a table which can fit it.

The good:
You get a ton of minis.
There are a lot of options for building your character.
The battle system is interesting and fresh.
Rewards for defeating enemies are interesting and have many different cards, keeping the game fresh.
The levelling and reward system is very good and interesting.

An expansive and enjoyable game with the right people. Too long and tedious for players who aren't into it. Be prepared for a long (5-6 hour) session, or even plan for multiple sessions.

I've always enjoyed co-op, so playing in teams adds to the fun, even if there is minimal interaction between the teams. I'm interested in trying the Shadow of War expansion which I've read improves the game.

I made a game like this when I was 15. You just *build* and shove forward units until they reach the enemies, upon which you roll dice/play rock paper scissors until there is a winner, who then moves forward to reach the next enemy units and repeats. Or you rush and beat the game in 5 minutes. Not a great payoff for a 10 minute set up. Even at that age I realised it's no fun. It's like a tug of war, but without the enthousiasm.
I actually feel sorry for people who like this game.

Pure, unadulterated, fun. The sheer weight of plastic pieces and plethora of cardboard markers easily identifies this as AmeriTrash goodness. My kids play WoW and love the novels, so they really dig the lore that oozes through everything in the game. Lots of monsters, tons of quests, loads of shiny loot. Combat system is really neat, literally buckets of multicolored dice. The rolls provide a nifty mechanism for combining ranged and melee combat, damage, and defense into the combat system. With such a large game though, it has a massive footprint, especially when combined with all expansions. The game can take awhile as well, and some may not like the downtime as your enemy players do their turn. Still, really fun, and very evocative of the World of Warcraft.

This is a solidly enjoyable game for me. Two major caveats, though: play with other people who play fast (i.e., won't spend 30 minutes analyzing their talent trees every time they level/train) and who also enjoy the online game & boardgame (it's not a short game, so if people start whining or dropping out, it gets a lot less fun.)

Adding Shadows of War speeds up the leveling so the game is less likely to reach turn 30 (a big plus,) but doubles the skills/talents (a big minus if people want to take their time and maximize every single last die.) Without the expansion, I'd rate this a 7, but since very few new rules were added, there's no reason I'd ever play without the expansion.

I have not played this for a very long time. I remember absolutely loving it, but the last time it hit the table, I was still knee deep in playing the actual computer game as well. The mechanics and game design are cleverly put together to actually quite well reflect the actual combat/gameplay of the computer game. Art, mechanics, and everything from the computer game are all here, which I love. I'd like to try it again, though IIRC it can be beastly long.

One, big disadvantage of this beautifully made game is little interaction between opponents. You are too focused on your character and mission too follow your enemy moves. IMHO It makes that WoW loses one of the vital elements of boardgames in general: interaction/rivalistaion between players.

I've never played WoW online but like the RPG style games. Really enjoy the games with confrontations. In this game the two factions do not worth to fight with each others. This is what I do not like. Doing quests grants you gold, experience and items. Beating the enemy only grants you proud :)

To the negative critics:
- Too complex to know how many dice to have, skills and items--> go and play domino
- Too many dice throwing and re-throwing --> it is necessary to balance the dice-lucky factor. Play Stone age and you will know how it is feel to throw once and have to accept the result.
- Half of the players are doing nothing when not active--> can do the character's skill buying, shopping or re skilling phase during the other sections turn (Okay, there have to be a trust the others are not cheating)
-->the inactive faction's player(s) can (should) manage the battles against the monsters...in this way the active players can not cheat or mistake because the monster are played by the enemy team. They will use all of the skills and value of the monster. They should place the tokens on the table, and not the active faction.

Overall, this game is good but not the best.

I really hate "the gathering things and who gathered the most is the winner" games (mostly they are in the top 100)[Agricola, Puerto Rico, Stone Age ..etc] but do not give a 1 or 2 because the game is well done and have good ideas in it. Every people who rated this game as a 1-2-3 should think about this.Give a 4 and comment it as: Not my type of game.

This is a hard one for me to rate.  Subjectively I'de give this a 3.  I felt it was over long and way to much of a dice-fest (and I enjoy a good dice-fest,) but having played the MMORPG (long enough to realize you can't have a life and be any good at the damn game)I found myself enjoying the character advancement. The most glaring flaw for me was the solitare nature of player turns.  I often found myself loosing track of where my oponent even was, and after the game, I'de be hard pressed to tell you 1/4 of what he did.  So, I can see the appeal, but this just isn't for me...  unless you beg.

RATING: 9
This game is great for fans of the MMORPG. However, one word of caution: this game is a bit long. For fans of Descent or Twilight Imperium, this isn't a problem. Also, this game works best with 4-6 players. Having only 2 players does work, but each player must control 2 characters each and this increases the playing time even more because of all of the customization. Unfortunately, for me it can be quite difficult finding 3 other people that are willing to play such a long game. If you like this, make sure to grab the 2 expansions while you can. This game and the expansions are currently out of print.

I've enjoyed playing many of Blizzard's computer games including Warcraft II and III. I haven't played the online World of Warcraft yet. I had a chance to the play the boardgame at a recent convention.  The components are very nice. The miniatures are nice, the board is pretty, but some areas could be bigger to fit the large miniatures, and the cards are nice. I found the combat system interesting. However, I didn't feel there was enough interaction between the two player factions. It felt like a dual-solitaire game to me. I found this to be very disappointing.

Dullest waste of 6 hours ever, if you like Character advancement go out and buy/play a real RPG. Not a single original idea in the box.Move a couple of spaces bash a monster, collect it's treasure, repeat. It's like they spent ages developing the characters and weapons and spells and forgot the game play.No interaction of any merit between the two sides and enough downtime to go and stand outside and smoke a ciggie without missing anything.Never again!

RATING: 4
This game has some serious problems. Its quite fun at the start, but once you hit about level 3 or higher it just gets out of control trying to track everything. The actual heart of the combat system is quite nice, with ranged damage and spells being able to kill monsters early, defence and normal attacks soaking up the monsters damage, and then being applied with attrition at the end. Its just the whole confusion of having loads of dice to track and further abilities that say "at end of dice roll step don't forget to spot one of these to do this", then again at the end of the reroll, then you remember the monster has a special ability, and so on.You can fairly say there that is hardly any interaction between the two opposing teams in the game at all, apart from the Beasts of Lordaeron card where you get to block their quests with the blue monsters. There is no reason to PVP against each other, and if you did you'd be rolling dice at each other for ages.But, despite all that, it does have a nice fun aesthetic feel. But the game really does end with a total whimper, either as a half-hour dice roll fest trying to kill the end boss while the opposing players just sit there watching. The only reason why they have any tension about you winning or not is so that they know whether they should start clearing up their side of the board (which takes bloody ages too, to sort out all the different tokens to go back into the box). Or if not against the bad guy, its an hour long dice fest as you PVP each other, which is more a chore than fun.In summary, I wouldn't go as far as to say that the game is awful. Its stupidly long and usually boring, but with a fun crowd you end up chatting and socialising with the other players while the opposing team takes their turn. I just don't see why you need to spend out Â£50 on a boardgame to help you do that, or you couldn't do the same with a game of much better quality. I rate it a 4 by BGG standards. It doesn't get me, but I could be talked into it if its a rainy day and I have nothing better to do.

If you really do want to play it, I'd advise using the cooperative variant with 2-3 players all on the same team, or 2 players control a character on both of the sides.

PS. The expansion to this game doesn't fix anything. Yes it gives you a reason to kill blue creatures, but they're just a slight annoyance, not one of the core problems with the game. It gives you many more options to create a unique character as you go up levels, but thats just more downtime pouring over your cards trying to pick the best ones which make you roll lots more dice. If you already enjoy the base game, then certainly pick up the expansion as it gives you more options, but it won't change your opinion on WoW if you already dislike it.

This game is a lot of fun.  My son and I both especially enjoyed leveling up our characters.  The only drawback is the amount of time it takes to setup and play and it takes up so much space you don't want to leave it out for more than one night.

The downtime is horrid.  The game just went wrong in so many ways.  The level of items and spells that one player has to calculate through each and every turn slows the game down to a terrible pace.

RATING: 3
After playing this game a couple times I'm sad to say that I find it severely lacking. 1/2 of the players just sit around for extended lengths of time, everything is just kill quests and the combat system takes a long, long time to play out with the limited number of dice in the game. In the end, this game just drags out after the initial WoW ambience wears off. As someone who has played the actual WoW MMORPG to 60 and beyond, the imagery and atmosphere provided by the game is true to Warcraft, but this doesn't save it from being a game that takes too long to play, for too little reward.

After one play with 6 players.  The game itself had fun combat mechanics and movement.  I just don't think it needed to be hoard against alliance.  I think the game would be much more fun playing only one faction against the board, using the turn limit as the win condition (I think the game would be more like an 8 if played like this).

Price point (55-80$), size of box (huge), and game play time (4-5 hours) bring down this rating as well.

There are plenty of reasons why this game is absolutely amazing. You can probe me if you wish my opinion but you can read other positive reviews and/or gameplay videos to get that aura. I'll make a general statement:

Mechanics are Solid, Wonderfully complex customization, Thematically on point, and truly a grand quest.

I would like to address the negative reviews of this game. There is a solid pattern from what I can tell anyway, and that is most of the "negative" reviews are people who enjoy games that are not complex.

"Multiplayer Solitaire, essentially a computer game, no player interaction." Not only is that inaccurate, but it's not even on the same ISLAND OF TRUTH. Please, do yourself a favor and don't even acknowledge the negative reviews, if you have problems with the game message me and I'll tell you why they're wrong. Those people highly rate plain and boring resource management "point-grabbing" and/or simplistic competitive/cooperative games. Puerto Rico, Pandemic are on the top 1 or 2 lists of all negative reviews. How dull can you be?

If you don't like complex and/or long games, stay away from this one.

However if you want a true fresh cup of strategy, indulge yourself on probably one of the most fleshed out character customization board games, and go on an epic adventure play this game or watch a video about it.

RATING: 7
I'll start by stating that I have virtually zero knowledge of the World of Warcraft universe short of being aware of the massive popularity if the online game.  I played this game with some trepidition dicefests can be really hit-or-miss with me, particularly on a game of this scale -- i.e. one expected to take five or so hours to play out.  I will say that I was pleasantly surprised by the game, finding it quite enjoyable.  It seems primarily like a more beefed up version of Runebound.  That can be good or bad, I suppose, depending on your point of view.  Still, there really is nothing quite like wandering around beating up on hapless monsters.  Of course, a few bad die rolls and they are not so hapless.  A couple of early deaths, particularly if soloing, can set your team back a fair amount.  There is also a fair amount of randomness in the types / strengths of monsters and locations that can skew the game.  Consequently, there is the possibility for long stretches in which you are doing nothing but the other team is really active.  That downtime can be bothersome.  It should be noted that the game is essentially multi-team solitaire.  There is some interaction possible, but it seems that this is mostly inconsequential.  I don't really have a problem with this per se.  However, it is possible for the game to come down to a PvP battle.  My understanding is that success at this requires different abilties / powers than is required for success against the game.  Since we ended up beating the game "Boss" this was not a problem.  However, I can see being very much disappointed if the game were decided by a PvP battle.  Somehow, that just seems out of place with the rest of the game and would probably lead to a lower rating.

I like this game. It feels like Talisman and Arkham Horror. Heaps of counters,cards and miniatures, cooperative play with your faction, tech tree as you advance levels and dice for that unexpected surprise. The factions are the new game element for me where one faction plays and the other has downtime. However this downtime is useful as it allows the faction to plan their next move and also plan their level advances. This is where the difference from Arkham appears as you play the game most of the time but may take on your opponents in PVP where the opportunity arises. But like Arkham it is a tad long in playing time.

A perfectly fine adventure board game with some nice & neat mechanisms, but way too long for me personally: our 6-player game took 6+ hours, and we omitted the final PvP battle, because it was obvious who would win, yet would have taken at least an hour to play (roll) out.

I have no issues with the balance or playtesting of this massive boardgame, but the length is a little long for what players get out of it. 

Why? Well, the game has the WoW flavour and lots of nice bits but after awhile, it gets very 'samey'. Quests have some flavour text but they are in essence just the same, only in increments of difficulty. There is hardly any 'tough' decisions or tension. Move, heal, throw buckets of dice, level up. Not worth the 3-5 hour investment. Ugh.

Oh, and the term multiplayer solitaire suits the game fine.

I enjoy the combat system very much, and it has nice flavour. However it has one huge flaw for me. Character development is so involved that you'll spend 50% of the (quite long) playing time completely focused on your character sheet and deck. The other 50% you'll spend taking turns with your team. Pretty much 0% of the overall time is spent interacting with the other team. It's basically two coop games going on at the same time and it's a slog... Too make matters even worse, sometimes if the game hasn't finished in time, it's decided in a big pvp battle between the teams. This is likely the first time you'll even look at the other team's characters, so if you're unlucky you can be completely hosed by their build. Not a game I ever plan to go back to.

The game focuses almost entirely on combat and character development, but it does those things quite well. It doesn't quite scratch that fantasy RPG itch, but none of these board games ever do.

On the other hand, there is a lot of variety in what you can do with your character and I like the way you can team up with other players in your faction.

RATING: 5
WoW is not bad, but in many areas a disappointment compared to what I was expecting. I'm all for games with eye candy, but WOW's miniatures fail in that aspect. The sculpts are ugly (well, some of the player characters are quite nice). This game is overproduced. The size of the figures could definitely been smaller. I'm sure the game could have fit in a box the same size as War of the Ring with some adjustments. It almost seems the aim was to create a big box game no matter what.

The game is essentially about battles (which are clumsy), and not much else. Underneath it all it is fairly simple. Faction vs. faction competition is a nice feature and WOW can be moderately fun. It has a little old fashioned "level your character" RPG-boardgame feeling. Pity the game is needlessly massive and takes far too long for its relatively simple content.

Not a bad game, though very lengthy.  A good questing game, though.  Not completely "competitive" other than as a race, though there are opportunities to directly interact with the other team.  My brothers, who both have played the PC game (one who plays extensively), say that knowledge of the PC game gives them greater insight into the board game; while they acknowledge it's not an exact match (which would be impossible), there was obviously a good amount of basis from the PC game to make the board game feel like a good "board game version" of the PC game.

Nagyon szépen elkészített kártyák, nagyon jól kidolgozott karakterfejlesztés, jól kitalált harcrendszer, de sajnos a másikra várás és a sok kockadobálás elrontja a játékélményt. A játékosok főként nem egymás ellen mennek, hanem különböző küldetések megoldásán fáradoznak. Ez csökkenti az interakciót és unalmassá teszi a játékot az épp nem soron levő játékos számára. A jól kidolgozott karakterfejlesztést szinte elnyomja a sok kockadobás. Több volt ebben a játékban, minthogy szimpla kockadobós játék legyen a végén.

World of Warcraft has way too much overhead for the amount of enjoyment it provides.  It has the feel of setting up a row of dominoes and knocking them over: lots of prep work for a quick bit of fun.  Much like its digital counterpart, all the quests are fundamentally the same, the skills and items you want can be fairly easily ranked, and the only skill it fosters is the ability to maintain focus for long periods of time.

Although the game looks quite promising on the first playthrough, there are two possibilities to play this game - and both are flawed. You can play it as one team, but then it gets boring after a two or three playthroughs since you know all the classses and most of the quests and items. The other variant - competitive play - is not much better, since it is a real killer with downtime, also the Horde are at a disadvantage because of the map layout and the quests they get. Not even the great artwork and the fine miniatures can save this game, unfortunately. Especially when you take a look at the price tag.

The PvP aspect is a bit more complicated and time consuming than I feel it really needs to be, but overall it's a game well worth playing. :D

1 play, partial game. This felt like a cross between Runebound (character development, leveling up, running around the board fighting monsters) and Descent (cool minis, action sequence, character skills). I liked it a lot, and would consider buying it except that we already have the other two and I doubt we'd play this much. I think it would be very slow with more than 4 players - each team is largely playing solitaire, in turn (we don't really get into PvP) and with 3 characters a turn may last too long. But I wouldn't refuse if someone wanted to give me a copy!

One of the first really long games I got into playing. Gave me the feeling of playing world of warcraft the MMORPG on computer.

If you are really into Warcraft then I imagine you will really like this game.  I'm not a Warcraft junkie, so I went into the game with a neutral attitude, which quickly turned negative.  The thing I really don't like about this game is the HUGE amount of downtime while others take their turns.  Now if I could use that downtime to plot and plan, then it wouldn't be so bad.  But the game doesn't have enough going on to create that kind of a situation.  So you just sit there and wait, and wait, and wait, and... until it is finally your turn again.  On the positive side, the board and figures are really cool, as are the items and ways to improve your character.  I wasn't sure what I thought of the combat mechanism, but it too seemed to drag out a bit.  I would say if you aren't already really into Warcraft, there are better games out there that accomplish the same thing this one does.

[1 play] Inital reaction rating.  First the pieces, the board, are very cool looking, no doubt it is a fine production game.  Secondly I think they did a decent job bring the computer game to life.  However, I still felt like the game itself was very average to me and by the end I was getting a little bit bored.  Do quests, get items, get money, do quests, repeat repeat.  A lot of stuff happens, I get things, I fight things.  I never really felt like I was in control of the game.  The cards and ablities start to get ridiculous after a while too.  There is so many ways to re-roll or roll something else or modify results.  I see other players roll some dice and then everything changes and gets re-rolled for this or that it was difficult to really understand what was going on.  There is a lot of items, ablities, etc that do so many things.  My preference is for a straight-forward hard thinking game.  This is just not that.  I could see giving it another try, although it is not on the top of my want list for sure.

[FFG edition] {Fantasy, racing; variable-player-power, dice-rolling, utility cards; optimal 4p} An intriguing adventure game. I particular like the leveling and multiple-player-characters system.

Player interaction within team is very strong. However, it's weaker between teams. IMO, 4p is a better way to play WoW because of less down time.

FFG has made a decently looking game. However, there are too many cards and bits, which make it too clumsy and fiddly.

It's a nice game; however, it just takes too long time to play with.  Without a suitable group of players, it's hard to get me to play this game again.

Given a choice between playing this game, chewing on Tin Foil and rubbing the tip of my penis with a cheese grater - I'll take the tinfoil. 

It's not a "1" because no game that looks this good and feels this heavy can rightly deserve a 1. But that's the *only* reason it doesn't get a 1.

This game shouldn't take more than 2.5 hours with 4 people.  There are so many turns where one side will just be moving, and nothing else, or training after a fight, that the other side can just begin their turn.  Each side only gets 15 turns, after all, and in a 4 player game, most fights are going to involve both team members at a single time.  If you play with people prone to AP, though, this game will take forever, as training options alone are worth 30 minutes of puzzling over

Agree with others that Deadly PVP is not optional - anyone who tries will understand this after rolling dice for 5 minutes to do 1 pt of damage to the other side (Heal!).  

Game could seriously use another path towards acquiring items (why, oh WHY is there no crafting?)

Haven't played this in a loooong time. I remember when I was younger my sister and I would set this up at our grandmother's house and we would take a week to finish a game (if we even did, sometimes we quit and packed it up), but now I want to play again since we're older.

Learning the rules for the first time and playing the game was not good.  It felt like the rules had not been play tested as I was flipping back and forth trying to complete a turn.  Also the rules felt like they were missing answers to some questions that came up quite a bit. The expansion may fix these issues but I am not ready to spend any more money on this one.

RATING: 4
A very involving adventure game with lots of options for building up  your character and advancing; choosing how to manage your turns and when to split up teams or act as a group provide a heavy amount of resource management.  On the downside, this game is insanely long (and space consuming), yet despite its length it doesn't quite feel like there's enough time to do everything you want to; its frustrating that you usually don't get to use level 5 abilities.

There's barely a point to having two sides, as there is virtually no interaction between the two.

Painted: 0/?

Cooperative rules for 2 players:
Play either Horde or Alliance. Start as usual.
To win, you must do all of the following before time runs out:
* Complete 3 Yellow Quests
* Complete 3 Red Quests
* Defeat the Overlord
* Complete 2 miscellaneous tasks; either defeating a Boss or completing a war. If there are none in play at the time and your other 6 quests are complete, completing another Red quest counts.

Auction items have a price of D8+the level of the character who wishes to buy it, established after you pick how much to 'bid'.

RATING: 9
Played several games now of this BEAST of a game. Miniatures galore, and really, really nice player character advancement. Combat is smooth.

Both times played as a two-player game, so cooperative variant used. Worked pretty well. Should be better with more players but I'm worried about the downtime as well.

Also, not all characters seem to be very balanced using only core set (rule of thumb: the more HP, the better).
Curious to see how this develops when I will include expansions.

Probably good to play as either a 2p cooperative game, or a 6p very extended beer & pretzel game with some good friends, so you don't mind the downtime :D

But boy, does this game look good and come with TONS of miniatures.

[APR 2017] Suprisingly, this game has developed as a mainstay 2p 'full evening' high-fantasy type of game, but not in the way it was originally written. We only play coop variant (cutting playtime to 15 turns, eliminating the downtime and shortening the playtime, basically) and as a coop, the game is allowed to show its qualities: a very, very smooth leveling system, a very solid dice-chucking combat system and a boatload of miniatures and quests. Still played once every month or two and I did totally not expect that to happen from all the negative flak it has received when it came out. Seek this out as a coop (see BGG for variant coop rules), or play your edition as one and you'll be surprised how good this game actually is. Rating revised upwards by one point.

I would deduct 3.5 points if played as written. The downtime would kill me, I simply fail to see this design choice (other than mimicking the MMORPG).

RATING: 4
A big big game that really doesn't offer a great deal of anything except a major hole in your wallet and a pile of plastic. This is a bog standard fantasy game where you get bigger and bigger, and so do the monsters. At its heart is a dicerolling fest, which they have tried to make more interesting by grafting on an overcomplicated and unintuitive combat system. Worse, the two ‘teams’ are completely separate for almost all the game, separated by tailored missions and a huge map board that seems 50% redundant. Occasional events throw a small lifebelt of relief, but really there is little more than killing monsters, and remarkably, nothing more original than a ridiculous Boss at the end. I think it would take at least three hours to play through, perhaps four, but really, who cares? We bailed after two hours. Stupidly overproduced, and the £60 price starts to look like a rip-off very quickly.

I've only played it as a Co-Op game, which is probably for the best. It works really good as that type of game, where you build up your character and try to take down the main boss.

I like it much better than some other games of the same genre and the customization of your character.

Let me start off by saying, I'm am totally biased. Been playing Wow since Vanilla and I'm a fanboy at heart. So with that said, take this review for what it is.

I absolutely love this game! For me a lot of what I love comes from the nostalgia and "flavor" of the combat, items and units. They did a good job capturing the feel of Vanilla warcraft. And the combat/talent system is one of my favorite in all board games I've played.

The game definitely has some flaws, but if you love Warcraft, you're going to love this game.

I'm not into MMORPGs, but I got sucked into World of Warcraft during a board game day at the FLGS.  The game is really just about killing monsters and leveling up, but it's  pretty darn fun.  I've always been a fan of rolling big stacks of dice, but the character powers interact in interesting ways & the semi-cooperative nature of the game are also big boosts.  I'm not keen on the PvP rules, though, and would recommend a house rule to others.

It gives you a good replica of the videogame. Of course, a game lenght is 3  hours, so it's not for everyone. Better to just play it cooperative, instead of dividing in two sides, even if this way it's less a replica of the videogame (but anyway, who would ever need an heavy to setup and long to play replica of a fast plug-n-play videogame?)

I had a problem with assessing this game. Single game is very long ( about 6-8 hours ) and halfway through is gets really boring, also the preparation for game takes a lot of time. On the other hand the character management is marvellous ( powers, talents, items, spells, everything you need to create your own hero).

Summing up - I think "7" will be a good mark for this game, but it's good to note that it is not game for everyone.

Sold because of playing time. 8h is a abstraction.

I quite like the character leveling and REALLY like the dice combat.  And typical for a mid-2000s FFG title, this thing is crammed full of awesome looking plastic.  There's also some neat MMORPG touches, like diminishing returns when grinding for XP against lower level enemies.  But the downtime is damn near unacceptable for how simple the game is.  

I'd like to try the official solo rules.  Eliminate the downtime and this might be a great game.

RATING: 5
When playing this in Essen, I thought there's a better Runebound on the way. But reality is: No way! The game doesn't live up to the high expectations. After the excitement of the initial rounds it calms down into a severe boredom the longer play takes place. It pretty much breaks down into a "Pick-up-and-deliver"-game without the "and-deliver"-part. Also, in this game the amount of imbalance is real bothersome. Death of a player can sometimes be more of a reward rather than it hurts you along your track. PvP is without any purpose until the end (if you dare holding on long enough to get there or the super-villain isn't slain before that). And what is it about the plastic miniatures? They look nice and everything but in a game of that price the least you should expect are high quality components. A lot of them. And did the monsters really have to come in "chewing gum green, red and blue"? At the fair I was told, they were still to change the colours of the monsters, making them look better. Obviously that didn't happen. So much for the bad part. Still, there's nothing wrong with levelling up your characters and upgrading them with better equipment. This game isn't all bad, a disappointment nonetheless.

Good game, I think they did a really good job capturing the amount of customization that goes into a player character with this one.

Really enjoy how your character progresses.  The events are enjoyable.  I like the race aspect.  I despise the length and downtime.  Only one play, would agree to more.  A once in awhile kind of game for me.  I like the competitive team aspect.    The downtime is magnified by the fact your opponents move do not have much influence on your next decision.  So the downtime is in fact, downtime.  If there was a way to minimize the downtime or increase the intereaction... there is a neat core.  The game as it is... is just too long for the payoff.

0 on 10 cuz its developped by Fantasy Flight, which I think of anytime I release myself in the toilet, the map is only a small portion of the World of Warcraft and because subsequent expansion did not met the size and glory of the base game; would have like to see the World map expand and see an expansion each time a video game expansion would come out.

Looks like a fun implementation of the mmorpg. Not having played the game, it's hard to see why it should take such a long time to play as people "complain" about. I will definitly get the expansions for this one. *** UPDATE: Our first play took longer time than expected. With experienced players the time needed to finish the game will be reduced greatly. Other timesinks is the dice pool step. Multiple sets of dice will allow players to prepare their dice pool in advace an thus saving time. I enjoyed the game very much.

Take on the role of a chivalrous paladin or a wise shaman, a holy priest or a vile warlock, a mighty mage or a crafty rogue. Play as a savage orc, a mighty tauren, a tribal troll, or one of the Forsaken undead; become an ingenious gnome, a doughty dwarf, a mysterious Night Elf, or a noble human.
Based on the popular World of Warcraft Massively Multiplayer Online Game from Blizzard Entertainment, World of Warcraft: the Board Game invites the players to choose from 16 characters, drawn from the eight races and nine character classes of the Warcraft universe, and take up arms for the glory of the Horde ... or the Alliance. Travel across Lordaeron, vanquish monsters, gain experience and power, and earn honor for your faction.
World of Warcraft: the Board Game is a team-based fantasy adventure. The Horde and the Alliance factions must compete to be the first to defeat the invincible Overlord – be it the lich-king Kel'Thuzad, the dragon Nefarian, or the demon Kazzak – or, failing that, to be the last faction standing when it comes to all-out war!

A great character building game with thousands of different card combinations and replayability. The team vs team idea is good, but makes the downtime unbearable, so we always play this game with 3 players, all on the same team. We just build up our characters until we feel we can master the overlord. That way, there is no downtime and everyone has fun.

Liked it. Nice artwork, lovely miniatures, strong RPG elements, roaming around the WOW continent, fulfilling quests, getting experience and gear and then leveling up to try to kill the boss.
I really did not like the game timing rule - that you only have certain amount of turns to face the boss and then the game ends with a forced PvP. Especially because it always felt like 1-2 turns before you were actually ready to face (or even reach) the main boss. PvP combat also feels a bit ... uncooked, slow, tedious. Very long game though, a game can last 3-4 hours or more (Like Mage Knight, just found MK much more enjoyable even though it lacked the familiarity of WoW and cute miniatures)
Still... a decent game that I would play again.

Holy cow, what a surprise.  This game rocks.  I don't play the PC game, I have no idea how much it "feels" like the PC game, I don't really care.  The combat system is just a lot of fun.  It's flexible enough to handle one on one combat or multiple attackers/defenders. I like how you can go it alone to try and complete your quests or team up if you want and try and take down some of the harder ones as a team.  There is a lot of variety in the characters and how you can develop them.  

For me this is a great game, but admittedly there is a huge inconsistency with the pace of the game.  Some turns all you'll do is Move and Rest and you'll be finished in 30 seconds.  Then your opponent will Challenge and Train which will take him 15 minutes.  There is little that can really be done about it.  You can try and do as much as possible during your opponent's turn, like waiting to draw and place Quests, and selecting your Power cards when Training after you move the turn marker and complete any Events.  But there are still times when you do this, and your opponent will finish his turn while you are still completing the actions started on your LAST turn.

Great adaption of the computergame. Very atmospheric and with loads of opportunities to customize your character. The combat resolution mechanic is innovative and the board and counters are beautifully crafted. The quantity of the rules is daunting at first, however, and the amount of bookkeeping that is required is a little bit offputting. The main drawbacks of the game are the quality of the miniatures (blech) and the fact that the game almost feels like a solitary experience per player or per team. The latter might, however, be inherent to this type of game (and is no different with games like, say, Talisman or Runebound). Better than Runebound though.

Fantastic game of the highest quality in all aspects. Manual is superb, all the bits for the game are great, figures are well done, and the list goes on and on.

I traded the WoW:AG for this big boy. That decision is getting better every time I play it. For me, the character development and battle strategy is just hands down better. Yes, it's long and down time can be a beast if you aren't in to that thing. Yes, you need a big table. But the thing is that the game is sound and it's a fun fantasy romp that's true to the source material. 

The one downside that I see is the end game. The timer mechanism is there to help bring an end to the game but it seems artificial and contrived at times.

This has become our favorite game. It's alot of fun, and plays surprisingly fast once you discover all the short cuts. Excellent theme, nice sense of danger in combat, and lots of options for character development. Me and my wife have played a few times now, and mainly play two player solitaire since we never do any PvP. We will probably try the cooperative varient next.

This game exhibits an interesting combat system which I like. It has one of the best character development sytems I have ever seen, which I also like. The game runs smoothly from start to finish with quests and items scaling nicely, which I like. However, this game is just WAY TOO LONG! If only I could play this in 3-3.5 hours instead of 6-8 hours. I just don't want to commit a whole day too play one freaking game. Giving it a 7 despite this, but I fear it is headed to eBay or the trader's pile.

A very nice "translation" of the computer game.  Definitely captures the flavor of building and shaping your character as in the MMORPG.  The game is MUCH slower paced, however, as you have to calculate all hits/damage manually - so if you're a player who enjoys the "guts" of the computer game, you'll probably like it.  

I like this better than Runebound -- the quests give more a sense of direction and plans can be made.  In Runebound, you just get to the next adventure spot and see what comes up.

Can seem a bit tedious at first.  But the time flies by and there's much fun to be had.  

1st time played - 6 characters (all newbies) - setup, rules explanation and game took 7 hours (but it flew by and no one minded)

2nd time played - 4 characters (2 newbies) - 4.5 hours

RATING: 6
Initial impression - limited plays
Score based on variant(s) for cooperative play
RAW game is a 3-4, and far too long for what it is.  Cooperative variants are still long for what it is, but hopefully the upcoming official expansion will fix this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For what it is, I really like it.  The biggest problems are that it takes a while to set up, play, and tear down, and there's a learning curve getting to know each of the characters and what talents and spells/abilities work well together for a non WOW online player.  

I don't see this one hitting the table often, but I like it and wont mind digging it out once or twice a year.

Our latest addition. It has some very interesting combat mechanics and gameplay characteristics. Endless options with regard to character development and team co-ordination. I love that it's possible to team up - I don't like competing with my friends ALL the time!

I've played this game a few times now, and it just gets better every time.  It's quite long (>6 hours), but has such a unique combat system, and is quite excellent.  You don't see too many team-based board games, and this one is fantastic.  It is the very definition of ameritrash - It's a FF Coffin Box, and it is full to the brim with plastic.

Ok, so this one is pretty definitely over-done.  The game really is longer than ideal, and probably has about 25% more content than it needs.  (Just like the online game).  But I really like it.  It works well solo, coop, or competitive (as designed).  Lots of options to explore in each game.  And the minis are fantastic

RATING: 4
This game suffers badly from a system that splits the game into 2 separate games, one for each faction, and then prevents one faction from doing anything while the other takes it's turn.  The turns can be quite long too which.

On the upside the box contains some wonderful components and a great map.  Just awaiting the decent rules to go with this now...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
My opinion of the game is going up with every play.  There is simply no other game I've seen that comes even CLOSE to how much this allows you to develop your character.  I've learned to ditch the full-blown two faction game and just play it as a cooperative game with 1-3 players.  There's next to no tweaks necessary to convert it, and it virtually eliminates the downtime.  It also allows you to focus on the game's strength, character building, and get away from the map a little more.  The board game does a very good job of capturing the computer game, even though some things had to go for simplicity's sake.  Sure, I miss managing aggro, and it's a bummer that high-level healing is mostly ineffective, but I'm willing to live with it for the ingenious dice mechanism.  This is my favorite pseudo-RPG, better than [gameid=17226], [gameid=699], or anything else I've played.

Good game love the character development and customization you have when building your character, but the game kinda falls short on replay value, I find one you play a couple time it just starts to get to be the same thing over and over, but none the less a good game and I enjoy to play from time to time.

Luca Iennaco say:

+) I like the fantasy setting and the team aspect, but interaction with the other faction is low (only some occasional PvP).
+) I like how you build the characters (customizing them).
-) I dislike that the gameplay isn't much varied (go there, defeat the foes, get the reward).
+) The "replay value" is decent (it's one of those games you don't want to play several times in a row, but once in a while it's always fine) and can be improved by the expansions
+) Interesting and original combat system.
-) Luck has a very important role.
-) Game lenght is significant.
-) Downtime (while the other faction plays) was acceptable but not negligible with 2 or 3, almost acceptable with 4 and unbearable with 5 or 6.
+) A fully cooperative variant (with some slightly altered rules) is playable and works fine. It is indeed the best way to play the game, in my opinion (but I like a lot purely cooperative games). Its rating would be a "6" if only the game "as it is out of the box" was considered.
+) Great components (bits, graphic), but high price tag.

Too cumbersome to setup. Too fiddly. Too... much ya know.
But... I, my nephew and my 13-yr niece gather together to spend some, let me see, 6 hours to beat those monsters up to grind our characters to epic level and finally fight the boss. "Wow", what experience. 
Few games can as a matter of fact replicate what WOW board game did. Congrats FFG.
My minor addendum: I'd include more neat mechanics when questing, since that part lack of flavor.

PVP combat is tedious, but the rest of the game is fun. It could be an interesting 4 player game, but the downtime between turns would be a huge issue, I think. Really good job capturing the feel of World of Warcraft. Good solo game as well, if you're subject to such patheticisms (I am...).

Sigh. I like WoW and I wanted to like this game so badly. Despite many attempts to play this with different groups, I have concluded that  

1. the game takes WAY too long
2. the turns feel very repetitive
3. the game takes WAY too long
4. team vs team interaction is virtually non-existent
5. the game takes WAY too long
6. it is ridiculously fiddly

Did I mention that this game takes forever? On the good side, character development and level-up is outstanding and the combat mechanics are spot on.

This game is kind of a train wreck. It has a lot of cool miniatures and rocking map of Azeroth, but that's about it. The combat system is so ridiculously clunky that I'm still not sure what they were trying to accomplish.

The box looks and feels "epic" from the very moment you set your eyes upon it. It's simply brimming with a host of eye candy which you can just sit and admire. However, while the game is clearly geared to capture the hype behind the famous MMO, there are certain issues with it. First of all the game takes a generous amount of time (in the 4-5 hours range). Second, there are certain gameplay issues (these are fixed with the first expansion). Finally, the whole, beat the bad guy concept, seems a bit ill suited and anticlimactic for such a game.

RATING: 4.5
Kind of fun, but it definitely plays like a computer game converted to a board game. It's very fiddly, with lots of dice rolling, checking the abilities of your cards, rerolling, checking the abilities of your cards AGAIN... This makes for a lot of downtime while you wait for the other team to make their moves. All in all there are better ways to spend 3+ hours.

Not RISK! This is a fantasy adventure game where you want to assume quests to improve your character(s) and defeat the evil one before your opponent.  Failing that, you will duke it out against your oppenent in a final PvP battle.  This is no Euro-game!  Playing time tips in at well over 2 hours even with 2 players and at heart it's a fantasy hack n slash adventure but a fairly good one at that.

Played again, still fun!  The game rewards efficiency, as wasting lots of actions will put your team behind quickly.  A race game, with some fun character development.  For some reason this game has garnered a lot of negative reviews.  I think it is better than folks give it credit for..

LOTS OF DOWNTIME: Solution - get an extra set of dice and do battles in parallel.  We finished a 6 player game in 4 hours by doing this, and everyone had a blast.

I really like this one.  Probably my favorite in the "Talisman" genre.  It would rank even higher if it didn't take so darn long.  I view this one as a two player game - adding more adds nothing to the game but time.  This game is definitely one where the journey is more important than the destination.

RATING: 7
After reading the rules and 1 play[yeah.. i know some people would say play it 10 times before touching any variants] I would feel this would be better as a co-op than a race.

Few changes I would make trying to make it similar to the mmo:
Blue mobs give 2xp on kill as they are usually tougher than quest mobs.

Items/skills can be equip on purchase or obtaining instead of waiting for maintenance phase. 

Intending to try starting at L2 /10g/1 random gray item[maybe draw 2 choose 1?] for my next game to in hopes to speed the game up a bit.

Interesting character development. But unfortunately, that's the only really good part of the game. Oh, and some of the components.

The game takes long. Very long. Not forever, but close. Lots of downtime.

The components are good. At least the tokens, character cards, other cards. But these ugly plastic minis. I like clorful minis, but these single-colored ones are cheap. Hard to tell apart in non-perfect light conditions for people who haven't played the video game. And then the horrible idea to use different colored figures for different monster levels. We always had to consult the tables to look up the stats and abilities for the different monsters. Some nice cardboard chits with the relevant info right there would make the game much more playable in my eyes.

 I liked this game, which is suprising since I do not like the online game at all. For a role playing boardgame, this has the best character development model around.

Like: Customized Character. Questing. Dungeons. Very nice dice combat system.

Dislike: Game Endings. PVP combat. You can play a smaller game while the other team takes it's turn. Weekend Killer. Shield Warrior is broken.

I was super excited to get this (after having previously traded away my other FFG coffin box games). I even found the "Shadows of War" fairly cheap so decided to add it in.

Well I arranged a whole day and 3 other players and we went at it! And...
I pretty much agreed with everything I've read about the game, both good and bad.

The good:
The levelling up system is the best implementation of any I've seen in a boardgame. True! There's a lot of meaningful choice, depth and character builds. Very nice.
The combat is very well done too. Somehow it manages to take all the systems in the online game and compress all that down into one dice roll - great! Admittedly that one roll has 20 dice in it, but still...

The bad:
FFG's trademark fiddly random counter hell. I need 3 plano's for this one. 3!!
It's 2 separate games going on with very little interaction between the sides. Heaven forbid trying to keep up with what the other team are rolling.
It's too damn long. Actually the game only lasted 4 hours. But when it feels like 6 hours you know something isn't right...

When will I ever learn about FFG games? Like most of them, I quite like this one, but I just don't see it ever getting played...

After 3 plays I'm spent.  I wish it was more of an RPG as opposed to a monster hunting dicefest.  Battles take way too long and so does the game.  Heaps of downtime.  Too long for what it is.  For a fun fantasy themed game go get Return of Heroes.

In theory, I do still own the different bits and pieces, but WoW itself as a game has passed on from my collection. It has been its backbone for many years and provided me with many long hours of entertainment.

It's a damnably long, excruciatingly packed with convoluted rules, with irritating random elements... and nonetheless, I can't think of another game that feels so enthralling. That makes you feel like you're actually living through this entire adventure, gaining skills and items. Plus the cards and figures are of masterful quality.

The components are that through which this game will forever live on in my collection. The coins, blood droplets and energy tokens sit high upon the shelf and find usage in so many different games. I don't quite know what to do with the ton of figures though.

took a long time to go through the rules, but they seem pretty clear, and we didn't really have any major questions.  there is a LOT of cards and stuff.  there was not enough interaction between the two side -- which i suppose duplicates the PC gameplay, but is maybe not so good in a face-to-face boardgame.  after a couple sessions i would say that this is a decent game, and that you could get to know the characters and abilities, and be pretty good at it.  there is still very little interaction between the sides, and that makes the wait before your faction turn seeem long.

Finally got to play this, and that's almost 8 hours of my life I'll never see again. PVP combat seems pointless, downtime is horrendous, and what a big fizzle in the endgame. One side rolls loads of dice to beat down the Boss as the other side spends that time sorting and bagging up their pieces. This game has SO many things to keep track of for nearly no payoff in the end. A real disappointment for me.

RATING: N/A
Would take a lot of time to play. Waiting time is ridiculous for the other team while waiting for each faction to finish its turn so I suggest to play every turn simultaneously. Some characters are easily better than the rest. (I played druid more than 3 times and my horrible dice rolls rendered me useless). The game aims to finish by 4 hours but it will easily stretch for an entire day.

I would rate it higher if it was a little shorter.  As of right now we have to plan our day around it.  Now this score may raise in the future when we become more efficient at playing it.  

Also the end of the game doesn't really do it for me.  Its truly about the journey not the destination, but what a fun journey it is.

I should also stress that this game has some of the best character customization I have ever seen in a game.

Great fun, but with several problems: Downtime between turns, unbalanced cards that could have been designed to work better together, figures could be better quality (though they are much better than most), a mild factor of repetition, interaction between the player characters isn't as connected as it could be, dice rolls get insane (though for die lovers like me, that's a positive), expansions are required to resolve certain gameplay holes (neutral units not having a point until bounties are applied).

Still- the art is rich, the game is, all else aside, very high quality, and the gameplay is great, though rather reminiscent of Runebound. 

Game does well in solo play.

The level system geta '10'. It's absolutely amazing. Playing the game, however, is not as fun.

It's a huge pity this does not have the slightest feel of anticipative adventure.

Only just bought this game. Looking forward to seeing how it compares to the MMORPG, of which I'm a huge fan.

For some reason, drinking and spending hours on this game is fun. As simple as "cheesing" it on this one is, our group loves to fool around with "weakly" designed talent builds.

I like this game alot! There is a very different kind of combat, and it takes a long time to play!

The most complicated solitaire I've ever played.  Only fun if you are half lit and have to do ridiculous voices for your characters.

Like many other games, I wanted this one to be my new Hero Quest. It suffices for some nice evenings of monster hunting, and the competitive side to the game works well. Since I first played the D&D Adventure System games, I haven't touched WoW, though.

Was für ein Monstrum von Spiel. Wir haben einen Tag für das erste lesen der Spielanleitung gebraucht und 2 tage für unsere erste Partie, die den kompletten Wohnzimmerboden in Beschlag genommen hat. Ja, es ist ein ganz gutes Spiel... aber diesen Aufwand will man normalerweise nicht auf sich nehmen.

Even doing Co-op this game is brutally long

Неоправданно долгая и очень затянутая игра.

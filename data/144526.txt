Not a bad game of set collection with a touch of memory (you make a pile of the cards you pick up and cannot check the contents of your stack).  A complication is that the card you take each round also determines the distance of your next move.  That can generate some tricky decisions.  There is also a tension between taking cards that benefit you or those that mess with an opponent's attempts to build a high scoring set. Despite mentioning tricky decisions above, my overall impression of Glastonbury is that there aren't quite enough of them and they aren't quite angsty enough.  As a result, this game only rates as a pleasant time filler.

The card artwork (same as the original Goldsieber edition?) gives a nice impression of a spooky old junk shop.  Sadly, that feel is not maintained in the jokey Franjos box artwork.  Production quality is fine.  The rules are clearly written, although better use could have been made of images.  It took a little figuring out to determine what the various card types looked like.

Kupferkessel Co. but with more options. Do the extra options make it better? I'm not sure, but since they're optional they can't make it worse. Using the 'Pascal's Wager' principle, you may as well have them.

First Play: The rules are easy enough. Move your (quite large) pawn around the circumference of a grid of cards a number of spaces equal to the number on the last card you picked up. Then take a new card on that row/ column. Collect sets for points and lose points for stray unconnected cards.

It all sounds quite strategic until the chaos cards get activated where the last card you collected gets discarded (so your planned move is trashed) and random cards are drawn to fill spaces opened up by other players. Another example of a game where the play can fall in your lap or slap you in the face. The owner predicted this wasn't one for me. He was right.

Nice redesign.  Have only played with 2, and playing with 4 could really make it particularly tough to achieve desired sets.  Even with 2, it depends on your opponents ..... if they play offensively by watching what you're collecting and try to stop you - or you stop them - it's a challenge to plan your moves and get to the cards you want first. The memory part isn't my fav., but overall the idea is good and play was fun.  Since we will play with 2 I'll hang on to to Kupferkessel Co. instead.

Wait, what? Yet another incarnation of this? To me, it offers nothing that Herr der Ziegen didn't, at a much less impressive artwork and rules which randomize everything (being stuck in a space for several rounds because there is an explosion every round isn't my idea of fun).

You move wizard shopper dudes around a matrix of goods, drafting cards and simultaneously setting up your next move, trying to complete sets and split your opponent's sets. You can't look at anyone's stuff, so proper play also means tracking some hidden but perfectly trackable information. Strangely enough, this memory element seems to have almost no effect on decisions while at the same time almost completely obscuring who's doing better. The multiplayer game would increase the significance of set splitting but is said to be impossibly chaotic as a result.

This is an odd game in which you move your little druid around a grid of magickal geegaws, trying to collect sets of them. You stack them on your cauldron and can't look in the stack. Each one is numbered 1-4, and whatever is on top of your cauldron determines how many steps you move.

It's weird and goofy, but a good deal of the game is out your control. You can only choose items in the row where you land, and you have to pick one. Sets you fail to complete will be worth negative points, so there's an amount of disaster mitigation on top of goal achieving. Even if you know your opponent is collecting Jars of Eyeballs, denying him one just throws negative points at yourself. So ultimately you just have to roll with whatever the game offers and hope for the best.

It's short enough that this isn't too much of a problem, but there are just plain other things I'd prefer doing.

Meglio giocare con le regole originali di Kupferkessel.

Setup:
Two players: 56 ingredient cards (two players color+five neutral colors) 
Three Players: 64 ingredient cards (three players color+five neutral colors)
Four players: all ingredient cards

+2 Accio spell cards
+4 Vanesco

No Immuto cards, no Declinatio cards, no Perluceo cards. 
Recipe cards A are ok, but optional.
Recipe cards B are unbalanced.

This game is a reimplement of the rare Kupferkessel Co. and now plays, in stead of only two, two to four players. I played the game at Spiel 2013 and I really enjoyed it.
The top card of your stack shows a number and that is the number of steps you may take towards the next row. From the row you may pick a card and add it to your stack. Unless you are cornered. You cannot pick a card then.
If you collected sets of three or more, the cards will score at game's end. And unique cards in your collection score negative. Some cards give you special powers. One of them is really nasty. They then have to discard their top card and that is a feisty way of ruining planning.

Glastonbury is a really nice fast paced game with nice components. Recommended!

Original [gameid=2533] is one of the two-player gems, that may be played with kids as well as by adults. I like it a lot. Unfortunately, new four-player version is almost unplayable. After one chaotic game, finished by most players with negative results I strongly warn you, dear reader: Play only original game or at least try to use original rules and everything will be ok. Shun four player games. Tweaked ingredients and power actions of new edition are messed.

No, this game has nothing to do with a music festival. How confusing :)
There is a theme there, but it's as pasted on as can be. So let's forget about that. This is a set collecting game. Score points for each set of cards, depending on how many you have. One card? Negative poits. Two cards? Zero points. More cards? Points. Cards with your own color? Double points (positive or negative). You run around a grid with your pawn and take a card from the row you land on. Simple. Not too much depth but enjoyable enough. Nothing you actually need, but not bad either.

Glastonbury is a game that I had seen a review about and was really eager to try.  Unfortunately it didn't quite live up to my expectations.

The game is simply a 6x6 grid of ingredients.  There are many different types of ingredients, but only four to each type.  On your turn you move your meeple around the edge the number of spaces shown on your ingredient card and select an ingredient from that column... which will decide how many spaces you move on your next turn.  There are four corner spots which don't allow you to take an ingredient.

There's an unusual scoring system which encourages you to focus on specific sets and avoid getting singletons of anything.  If you get three or four in a set, you get scoring bonuses.  And if the set matches your player color, the set's score is doubled.  There's also some hidden objective cards.

So theoretically, the tension between wanting to take some tiles because of how they'll score for you and wanting to take others for how they'll influence your movement should be fairly interesting.  And I guess it is.  The thing that makes this game annoying is that it's just too easy for other people to poop on your plans.  Getting sets in your color is crucial to winning the game, and if someone takes any cards in your color, then you're pretty screwed.  Additionally, other players can tank some of your hidden objectives without even knowing that they are.  Especially as some hidden objectives are harder than others.

In our first play, one players was falling asleep during the game.  He had to be continually reminded how to play, and that he couldn't take cards at a corner spot.  As a result the other players were often suggesting moves for him, and letting him take cards of his color uncontested.  He dominated in the scoring because no one bothered to crap on him and he got two complete sets in his color.

I want to like this game a lot more than I actually did.  It's a fairly light filler game, but I think it might be a little long for what it offers... and it's not really that long.  The other opinions at our table were a lot harsher than that... the winner absolutely hated the game, repeatedly saying that it wasn't good and it wasn't a game, and another player who said he'd rather play "the other game" regardless of what the other game might be.  The notable exception being that the person who ridiculously overpaid for the game felt that it was a good game.

cute and simple game (but can have vicious moves)

[+] interesting mechanic, i like the memory aspect (not everyone does), nasty scoring system (can get negative scores)
[-] theme is low, spell cards are very powerfull (and it's random who can get it first...)

Move around a square and collect objects in the kitchen. 
But if you don't have enough objects of a kind you score negative points. Classic idea but it works well (even with 2) and beautifull artwork.

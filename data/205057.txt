Similar to Boggle, except that the letters are disappearing and slowly reappearing, and you need to find letters that aren't going to be taken by other people while still finding words that use them.

I like the idea, and enjoyed the game, but would not need to own as my family does not share my enjoyment of word games.

Box is disappointing.  The player boards do not fit horizontally, so have to be stored vertically, which means the box lid does not sit flush and, is in fact, resting on the player cards. Any pressure on the lid and these will crush/bend inside the box. Never seen such poor design before. Game components otherwise look fine. Have yet to play the game. Will post rating once played.

A great little word game that combines spelling and area control. The combination works really well, partly due to the non-adjacency rule which opens up a lot of possibilities. The rules are simple, the game is accessible and the options in the box provide a lot of variety, but the special abilities could use a little spicing up. Also, invariably the special ability you've picked either makes no sense in that game or is super expensive and your stolen tiles are hard to come by so you have no option to put it in play. 

Have played all of the modes - basic, co-op, advanced with both abilities and weaknesses, and with either abilities or weaknesses. Basic is our favourite, with using the weaknesses second. Very pleased with this game overall and give it 2 thumbs up for theme (who would've thought word games could have a great theme?), presentation (the tiles and zeppelins are high quality, and Ryan Goldsberry's art is some good retro fun) and just a brilliant time. However, you end up with a crap ton of tiles in front of you and it's really just too much. We've house ruled that you place a zeppelin on every letter you use, and if it's a stolen tile it gets discarded at the end of your turn. Helps to keep your options limited and your play area clear. Also...

The box is tragic. End of.

Great gateway game that plays well with gamers, too. Going to favour word people, naturally, but it’s more satisfying than Scrabble by allowing you to create longer words like “confabulation.” Still, it’s challenging because even if you can come up with a great word, it might not land you the tiles you need to gain more points in the end.

Looking forward to trying out the character special powers.

Currently I'll play this game over my other top spelling games (Word on the Street and Bananagrams) due to its theme and unique area control and special power mechanics. My only complaints is that the box is too small and that the character and round tracker cards are too thin.

Kickstarted, received July 2017. A decent word game with an area control element. It's a bit fiddly when you steal a tile and have to replace it with a blank one. Haven't tried the variable player powers. Sold in November 2017.

A hidden gem.

I looked at the 60+ crowd funded games I've backed and of the ones I've received this is easily one of the best.  That's not to say it's deep or profound.  Rather, when I back a KS game I want to know I'm getting something original (and helping make it happen) and that it's a solid game.  This wins on both those counts.  It's a word game with area control.  I would rather play this over Scrabble or Boggle any day of the week.  It's a word game that doesn't require a huge vocabulary to win.  In fact, understanding area control is probably more important than vocabulary.  Of course, vocabulary helps, but it's not the be all and end all.

This is a great word game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Lower player count is more fun because the grid is smaller, allowing for fewer letters to choose from.  Both the area control and word game parts are enjoyable.  Best without variable powers special cards as the abilities are never really worth spending tiles to use and the weakness letters limit you in a "challenging but a less enjoyable" way.

On another note...the box lid rests on and squishes the player cards which only fit in vertically.  I guess its a good thing I don't like those anyway since they are all slightly bent at the top now.

We added a home rule that when you must discard any of your stolen letter tiles if you use them to form words. Otherwise players accumulate too many letters and have too many options. Though this may upset the balance of the character's special power costs.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is definitely an interesting twist for a word game where you score for areas based on the letters you use in 6 words you find through the game.  May need to use an egg timer to prevent AP.  The challenging letters have special powers which can be used when you use them in a word. Words cannot be repeated. 

The box is poorly designed as the player boards extend beyond the top of the box and as a result will bend slightly when the lid is put on. Not sure who was sleeping on the job there! However, there sure isn't any packaging of air going on in this box!

Have only played the 2-player game so far.  Great word game.  Scrabble is the typical example of a word game but I hate that the best strategy is to use small 2 letter words.  

With word domination the best strategy isn't necessarily to use the biggest or smallest words but to use words that repeat letters your opponents have used or lock in a key letter that prevents them from using it in the future.

Based on one play: Use the letters on the board to make words but you must include your selected letter. Once you use a letter on the board twice you capture it which gives you a point and if you can capture a set of 3 or more adjacent tiles they double their points. Once captured the letters are available only to you. It is fairly simple to make words, but you need to use the same letters back to back while also trying to block others from making captures thus long words are best. I am not generally a fan of word games as my vocabulary has never been strong, this game is much more accessible since words are simple to make but it is kind of dull, so more avid players will find it dull while the mechanics will leave gamers wanting more, thus not really worth it in my opinion.

There is so many things I love about this game. First, the visual is astonishing. Second, it plays so well for a competitive word game that I can either play with experienced gamers and less-so experienced ones. Third, since I played Scrabble my whole teenage years with my parents, it hits a melancholic inner feeling that is very pleasant.

I have been waiting with great anticipation for Word Domination, and we finallygot it Saturday.  It was the first Kickstarter Game that I ever backed.  It was so worth the wait!  My wife and I loved it, and my twelve year old daughter played very competitively with us :)  My wife said she's sure it has already become one of her favorite games... Thanks Jeff Beck, Tim Fowers, and Co for a terrific word game, and We can't wait for Hardback and the Paperback expansion :)

Word Domination is undeniably clever. By focusing on area control and word length rather than tricky letters — but then letting the tricky letters set off superpowers — it's really just flaunting its intelligence. But it also favors the leading player, smacks you with crippling letters now and then, and doesn't necessarily play nice.

So, hey, I like it, but not as much as I'd hoped.

Very fun game! Just played it with the kids.
Made our own bit simpler version. We left  out the powers of the black tiles. So only making words, placing zeppelins and owning tiles. Even this toned down version was really cool! Everyone loved it. Will probably end up on the table a lot.

Many word games have a spatial element (what letters you can connect, or what areas you can build a word), but what makes Word Domination unique is that the spatial element doesn't control what you can make, but determines how good it is to make those words. And not directly with points, but indirectly with trying to build up areas of letters you've used a lot.

There's a game in here somewhere, but this isn't it. With no adjacency requirements the set of available letters is just too large to make finding words very interesting - as the pool of letters in the center shrinks players will have more and more stolen letters which they can use every turn. (It might be OK with just two players, since the grid is smaller.) We played with special abilities, but it was never worth spending the tiles to use one.

The art is great and the game is not bad, although it's better appreciated by people who do have an established background in pop fiction (i.e. 12+).

This is a rare game that I can say I knew I'd like before I even played it. As a KS backer I watched the video on how to play and could see it was fairly easy to understand while offering a unique word game experience. I paid extra for the mat which I think really increases the enjoyment of the game. Which brings me to my gripe - this game is good enough to have warranted a better package. It deserved a  bigger box, a board, and large bag to mix the tiles.

Update: 3 plays so 2p and rating still stands.  This might not be a good game for more players if there's AP, but that could be said about many games.  This is really a gem of a game.  But again, shame about the box.

It's fun, but some of the rules just don't work well.  First, you get way too many tiles at the end of the game.  Second, the game feels too short.  A few other minor points, but it is never a good sign when I adjust or leave out rules of a game.  There is a good concept here it just needs refinement.

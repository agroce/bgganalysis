RATING: 10
A more compact - both in terms of the map and the playtime - spin on 1830, that appears to lose none of the depth or teeth of its progenitor.

This combined with the wonderful PnP job from my 2017 Secret Elephant makes it a perfect intro 18xx, not to mention a good go-to title whenever a CCMF opportunity presents itself.

A nice entry level game, short and sweet but can also be quite vicious as the stock market can be volatile, companies are subtly different and the train rush can be quite fast, although there aren't many train slots to easily get a 6 train so it can stall if someone engineers it which feels like a good part of the game and something to watch out for.

RATING: 8
After one play with six: I'm not convinced that the game is very good with six. The fact that there are only seven corporations meant that for most players there is no second corporation to save them from early mistakes.  Worse yet, once all the 5-trains have been purchased there are probably only two companies that have space under the train limit to buy a 6-train to keep the game moving, but in all likelihood these companies are out of cash in a six-player game, as somewhere around 6 of the 7 companies are opened early and parred low.  It may be a much better plan to hold off (i.e. play investor) until you can float a company at a high par to buy some real trains.

There appears to be an interesting (and short) 18xx game in there.  The rules are more or less the same as 1830 on small and terrain-heavy map.  Our game, despite being six-player finished within about three and a half hours, which compares pretty favourably to games like Poseidon.  I'd like to give this a try with 3 or 4.

A relatively simple 18xx game, but I'm not sure I'd start people on this.  The tokens can end up really blocking play, but not as badly as some other games.

Would prefer not to play this again with 4.  Seems to be best with 3.

RATING: 8
A decent alternative to 1830. Not many rules differences, good map with plenty of options to explore, though the limited number of tokens sometimes made it feel rather open. Beware the power of the diesel trains, they can easily make twice the income of a 6.

A good choice for some variety, particularly for a smaller number of players; very good choice for 3 players.

Clearly superior to 18AL and 18GA, which are its direct competitors. The map is more interesting, the companies are more interestingly positioned and the game gives you a few nice choices in track placement and upgrades.

Stations are very cheap (all of them cost 40), but not very numerous - companies go from 0(!) to 2 extra stations only, with most of them having just one.

Also, it's definitely the most hilarious of all 18xx for portuguese speakers.

There's an awful lot to like in this design. The map is full of options yet still demands careful planning. It's an interesting puzzle, no matter which majors you're running. The train rush is unforgiving and demands focus and creativity. The 2D stock market behaves as it should with no double jumps for big payouts. One of my favourite elements is the phase progression from one to three ORs. It gives the game a tension and excitement as the quickening of a bank break looms. Also of note is the rule that ends the game abruptly when a major goes bankrupt. Deserves all the accolades it gets.

RATING: 5
My first 18xx played. Stock exchange works fine and game gives some fun. Still: too much counting, noticeable downtime, many decisions are rather forced (not chosen), it finishes too abruptly, building new railroads is not very eventful, only a few actions are taken on a stock exchange. I understand how people find it good in terms of simulating operations of a company, but I prefer other games for that amount of time needed to play it.

2012-09-18: Although I've only played it once, since it's an 1830 clone on a smaller map, I feel confident saying I really love this game.  My one play was a 2 player that ended with a $6 difference in final scores!  I'd happily play this with 2 - 4 players (although I probably would still pick 1860 over it for 2).  

2013-09-18: Not a bad short 2-player, but the reason I still have it is as a teaching game.  Other than that, I'd choose either 1860 (2-player), 1846 (short), or 1830 (similar mechanics with rougher edges).

RATING: 7
My ranking of this game is likely just a reflection of my feeling for 18xx as a genre after three plays (two of (1889). I'm still not sure the enjoyment is with the playtime. I'm still just trying not to get caught up in the gears; certainly no artistic play (although the last one where I ran three companies, did a lot of train shuffling and managed the train rush quite well was getting close to the art of the game). That is not fun. The incentive play is not as strong as the Winsomes i love. But there is a satisfaction in operating companies, even if route tracing and planning are very weak points for me.

I'll keep giving these games a shot as the opportunity pests itself, but at this point, it is just a bit out of my comfort zone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Quite possibly the best game to introduce players to the 1830-branch of the 18XX.  There are close to no rules changes over the 1830 rules, no McGuffins and no chrome.  It is an excellent tour of the base game's rules-space.

Significant rules changes over 1830: 

-- 5 shares to float.

-- New track laid must be runnable by the constructing company

All other rules changes are minor.  

This is an odd game to rate.  Rules-wise it is a straight 1830 clone, a game which I rate a 7.5, however the game is less programmatic than it seems at first and is far more operational in nature than 1830, which also improves its position with me.  Next add the fact that it plays fairly easily in under 3 or so hours and supports 2 or 3 players for a quality game and some enthusiasm enters the fray.  For now I'm leaving it at 8.  I could see it rising to 8.5 in a pinch.

The train rush is rarely fast or particularly brutal, however getting the right trains in the right companies at the right time (even if you have to pay out of hand) is near the heart of the game.  1889 is rarely a token-war game, trains and routes effectively dominate and it isn't hard for dividends to outpace the gains from increases share value.

Update: Get good 1830 players in the mix and 1889 takes on a whole new light.  it remains an excellent teaching game, perhaps better than even 1830, simply because it more stable and less dynamic than 1830, but it has a surprisingly large range and dynamism for such a small game when the players are good, sharp and aggressive.

03-18-2014 - I'm an 18XX newb, and this game was played PBF.  A fun game.  We are racking it up for another go!  Not having lots (or really any) 18xx experience, I won't try to rate or compare this game to other 18xx games.  I am pleased, though - fun game.  For five players, it seemed like a rather tight stock market.

05-11-2014 - Second PBF game completed, this time with 4 players.  This game felt a bit more wide open, less competition for shares, but more shuffling for priority deal, and more selling shares to gain position for the ORs (and hence train buys).  I can already tell that this series of games, while fun, will take me many, many plays (maybe 50? 100?) before I start to completely grok the strategy and all the working parts.  Even after that, it'll just be a basic understanding of "So he did that, which affects this, and so I should do this if I want to do this . . . oh crap, he did *that* . . . "  I can see why it is loved (and hated).

RATING: 9
This might be a good teaching 18xx, but it is not a beginner game.  89's strategic range is wide and all decisions are meaningful.  I'm finding it more difficult to play well after ten plays because the options are dizzying.  It would be a shame if people only use '89 to teach and never really dug into it with seasoned players.  Bonus of course, that it's a perfect 3P weeknight game.  I've played a timed game in 2.5 hours, and a tense game that took 5.5 hours while we winced in pain from all the tough decisions inflicted on us.  DTG edition.

Basically ports the same rules as 1830 onto a smaller map, tighter track distribution and some interesting private companies. The result is a very interesting, shorter 18xx game that is well suited to lower player counts.

I'm looking forward to more plays.  I think this one could be a good option locally for some shorter evening games.

RATING: 8
1889 is basically a smaller version of 1830. It occupies space similar to that of the free print and play 18AL and 18GA games, but lasts slightly longer and seems better balanced.

The rules here are very close to straight clones of the 1830 rule set. The main differences in play are caused by the small board and the fact that there are only 7 public companies, and a bank of only 7000. The stock market remains as vicious as it is in 1830, and as in that game, the train rush can come fast and furious after the early game. Bankruptcy is definitely a possibility as the train prices spiral toward the end of the game.

I have been something of a skeptic when it comes to shorter 18XX games in the past, but 1889 gets the style about perfect for my tastes. The tile mix means the board has the potential to develop differently each game, and there is some room to manoeuvre in the mid-game that doesn't seem to exist in the other games.

The downside of this, of course, is that you have to order it and then wait for it to be filled. For my money, it's worth it though, and this is definitely worth a spot in my small collection of 18XX games. Probably not good with more than 4, but excellent with 3.

RATING: 9
Another great introductory game for 18XX series. This is almost as great as 18AL or maybe the same. It has more texture than 18AL, but with consequences of taking longer than 18AL. 

It's probably also has fiercer nature than 18AL, but still more forgiving than 1830. And the rules is more closely to 1830 than 18AL.

Specialties:
- Lots of private companies, with effect, exchange to shares, and block hex.
- 7 companies, making it interesting for any number of players
- The most similar of 1830 rules
- Terrain heavy
- Contested track tiles

Maybe this is based on the lack of 18xx experience but 1889 is a fantastic, small implementation of the 1830 rules on a map that is manageable for the casual players and short enough that it could be played without scheduling an entire event around it. The stock market is much richer than 1846 and has some interesting decision points for players. I can't wait to play it again.

1889 has a number of strong parallels to 1830, and really the rules differences are relatively minor. The combination of board structure, floating rules (5 shares to float instead of 6), and privates however, makes it a distinct and fun experience, though one that I ultimately find to be not as interesting asother 18XX games. I do not feel the need to own a short 18XX game, so I ultimately sold this one.

Similar to 1830, which I rate lower, but 1889 is cleaner and I'd be willing to play again.  Also, the graphics are lovely, which is a stark contrast to the new Mayfair/Lookout version of 1830.

The one game of 1889 I played was with 5 players, and I don't think it's ideal for this player count.  If I played in the future, I'd aim to play with 3 or maybe 4.

It's a smaller 18xx, and is a fine introduction to the system.  The map is *nasty*, though, and the game can get very rough very quickly.

1889 is similar to 1825 in that terrain is severely limited, and therefore placing the right track at the right time is crucial. At the same time it is also very different because the stock market is much more volatile and important. Stations are also very limited (most companies only have 2 markers, one even has to make do with one) which makes the decisions where to build them all the more important, especially when the unlimited Diesels come into play.

Feels like quite a good mix between a stock manipulation game and a game of railroad operations. Both aspects are important here.

====

1889 is another shorter 18XX offering, but it is not watered down in the least. The game is in the 1830 vein, so what that means in a practical sense is that much of the play revolves around stock manipulation and holdings. An additional bonus of 1889 is that it plays pretty well with two, though I've only tried it once and enjoyed the 4p game more.

RATING: 10
A really solid 2 player game. Excellent for an introduction game to the 18xx world especially with the beginner's rules. Good with 3 and 4 players also. Not recommended with 5 or 6 players.

Core rules are similar to 1830 but in a small, terrain heavy map (but not as terrain heavy as 18MEX but nasty enough).

Word of caution : Never let anyone get the Private that comes with a free share of Iyo for cheap. Or suffer the consequences later..

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing.

1889 is a good incarnation of the 18xx system to start with as it's clearly laid out with a small map and a comparably short playing time of 3-3.5 hours. It belongs to the 1830 line but it didn't feel as cutthroat as I remember 1830 from my one play. The few available station tokens help here as they restrict my personal ability to usually make a medium-sized to big blunder per game in this area. We usually play this with three players. With 4 players it gets a bit tougher as one player will only get one of the 7 companies. The games tend to form huge circle runs in the end that were only partially restricted by tokens. Diesels will get huge returns. Among the first 18xx's I would choose to play.

After one play in board18, I enjoyed this game very much. It's similar to 1830, but in a smaller map, simpler privates and shorter duration. After buying 1846, which I usually can play every 1-2 months, I was wondering if I could get another 18xx that could be played here (there's no dedicated 18xx group where I live), and it would be interesting if it was something in the 1830-branch, but 1830 itself is probably unlikely to be a hit. Now it seems to me 1889 can be the best candidate.

An excellent title to use as an introduction to 18xx while still being a title of interest for fans of the genre. I find that I enjoy the smaller map and shorter play time compared to it's predecessor 1830.

I'm only 2 games in and neither played out fully, but I can tell that I'm in on the 1830 track of 18xx. Not expert enough to feel able to fully appreciate why I should prefer 1830 over '89, over '57 for that matter, but I don't feel like I need to yet, just enjoying the ride thus far.

1889 is kind of my "go-to" 18xx title for the moment. Its short play time and low rules overhead make for an easier game to get to the table or even to run online. Looking forward to playing this more and I have a feeling the rating will increase.

My second 18xx title and the first I purchased on my own. After one play, I'm still clearly in a honeymoon period with 18xx, as I found the game absolutely engaging. So, I'm tentatively giving this a 9 with an acknowledgement that that rating is really more based on an excitement for 18xx in general rather than being based in comparison to other 18xx games. Only experience will bear out if this rating will hold.

Very nice. Fairly simple 18xx game, the route calculation gets tricky in the end but otherwise this plays fast. Shouldn't be hard to play in three hours + there's Rails support.

FINALLY finished a three month online game of this, and I still think I'd prefer that to playing in person. This is probably more interesting against more experienced opponents, but I was winning my game from very early on, so it seemed like it was mostly a couple months of waiting for the game to come to its inevitable conclusion. Other than the selection of Privates and the shift to Diesels, I did not find myself carefully considering my moves, so this was essentially one interesting move every 1.5 months. I'm interested in trying again, but it's not calling my name.

This is sort of like a shorter, nicer 1830. But its not that short or nice if you have not played 18xx.  There are beautiful Japanese locomotive illustrations on the train cards.  The map revolves around the big money at Kotohira.  

Play is surprisingly different from 18AL and 18GA:  
a. Towns [b][i]do[/i][/b] count against train size in 1889
b. The diesels have unlimited runs (unlike the 4D trains in 18AL) the endgame feels very different.  
c. There are 7 corporations in 1889, which I like better than the 6 corp games.
d. The biggest difference is that players may buy multiple trains per OR, up to the train limit.  I love this! It speeds up the game and lets players asset-strip their corps faster.

RATING: 8
1830 with a different map and better privates. You only need 50% to float in this one and the bank is 7,000 instead of 12,000. Plays shorter and is less aggressive than 1830. Tile mix is also better. Works extremely well as a beginner game or as a more cutthroat experienced game. 

Got a PnP copy until I can get an official DTG copy.

Has a great advantage as a teaching game in that it is small, compact, quick (for an 18xx), and transistions into the meaner 1830 pretty seamlessly. It is about 90% of 1830's ruleset, with a few small changes, most notably that 50% floats a company and not 60%.  

Scales interestingly as well, since games with the G Private play out differently than without. Not as aggressive as 1830, but this is still a good one.

The upside:
-It's like 1830 lite. You get that streamlined/polished feeling, but in a short amount of time.
-Cute privates.
-I don't know why, but the track building on this one seems more fun than any other 18xx.
-It's perfect as an introduction to 18xx.

The downside:
-Replayability issues?

Short 1830 on an island in Japan. This game feels a little too constraining for an 18xx type game. I enjoyed it, would play it if someone asked, but probably would not own it. It simply is not as intricate as other 18xx titles.

Beautiful game. I like 18XX games that have a super-cutthroat stock round. This game is clearly a superlative version of 18AL, and plays so rhythmically like those 2.0 weight games. Unlike what some suggest, it's not the best 18XX intro, as new players get slaughtered in the stock rounds alone.

RATING: 8
--Feb2010-- As an introduction to the 18xx space, this was pretty gentle (all things considered.)  I'm still a complete novice, and any more detail would likely be more than I could deal with.  Even then, there were more bells, whistles, dials and levers in the system than I understood:  disturbingly reminiscent of visiting the cab of a mothballed steam locomotive as a young teen and wondering "What might _that one_ do?"
--Sep2016-- And having now played it a bit more (and the 18xx more generally) I'm quite amused by this one.  The opening private auction is crunchy; the map is interesting; and I'm still not clear on many of the questions of pacing.

1889 is another great game in the 18xx family, similar play to 1830 but with shorter time length. 

A good mix of short-term and long-term investments, turn order manipulation, stock manipulation, cutthroat tactics, blocking, and really squeezing out every last dollar to get or stay ahead. It's not just what you do but when you do it and who you do it to.

A very interesting 18xx variant. I enjoy railroad map expansions/games with a focus on Japan. This was no exception. It feels like 1830 on a smaller map and with a quicker playtime. Obviously the map differences and other factors make this one a different game from 1830, but at the same time the general rules are pretty much exactly the same as 1830. I am looking forward to playing this a little more. 

I can see this game being a really good introduction to the 18xx series. My first game was a three player game with two players brand new to the 18xx series.

1889 is a microcosm of 1830.  You get almost the same rules and the same dynamics but playable with fewer players in less time.  Some of the sharp edges might be sanded down, but there's enough meanness in it to satisfy me.  As with the rest of the meaner 18xx games I've played, my rating could go up with more plays.

RATING: N/A
This is a very nice 18xx title. A lot to think about, it plays in about 3 hours and it is quite good with three players. it seems very balanced in all its aspects of gameplay, very tight specially at the beginning. Train rust seems to be the major issue here, in which players tend to make the most mistakes. All companies fluctuate early in the game despite the difficulty in getting money. I saw an early start from one player that was caught in the end so it seems that things can be real very well balanced. Needs more play to decide its accurate rating.

Playing with the beginner tiles included makes the make slightly less intense for teaching, but the stocks are still more harsh than 18FL.  If you are the only experienced player, you can, of course, decide not to play a harsh stock game.  In this fashion I think this works very well as an intro game.  personally I find enough going on here that I think it will last longer for me than 18FL.

Solid short(er) 18xx title, that can be a good introduction to the genre.  Better than 18AL or 18GA because 7 majors means that there will be an unequal number of presidencies in both 3 and 4 player games.

A fine economic game, though its length hurts (for me) its chances to be played again with me in the table. But I do liked how the market work, the choices that one must made with his companies, the shares, the routes. All in all, a good game that its just not one of my tastes.

I bought 1830 but ended up having this be my first 18xx play.

Lots of excellent interplay and possibilities for victory.

For a first play, 4p finished (3 veterans and i the newb) in 3.5hours.  It felt long and the near must reliance upon Rail game app kind of irked me but it is nature of the beast.  There is so much book keeping in this game but w/app it really rocks not having to do so.  

Thoughts on game itself:  Skill level differential makes for a tough chance to actually be competitive but with grokking of player intent, there is a chance.

Really enjoyed it.  Not something I could do on a weekly basis yet (Time, location, brain burn) but there is a lot of game here and a heck of a lot in the system itself.

RATING: 4
After 1 Play: I can see why some others like this, but it just isn't for me.  At heart it is much more a stock market game than a train game, and so while the actions on the board are secondary, they still take up most of the playing time.  If I'm going to play a game about manipulating stocks, I'd prefer to focus my energies on that aspect and not on a very complicated board situation that only really matters in how it changes stock prices.  If that makes any sense to you, and you want to try an investing game with more focus on the investing, try [gameid=5] or [gameid=94]

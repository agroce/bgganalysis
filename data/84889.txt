1st edition with upgrade pack & solid map (waiting). 

Absolutely fantastic low-fi evil game featuring demonic cannibal necromancers. 

We use a modified Turbonecro variant and add +1 to all movement/excavation stats for a faster game. The beginning of the game is just too slow. I also wish there was a co-op variant.

Finally got a chance to play this!  Beast of a game--tons of awesome cards and an insane devotion to theme.  Would love to play it more, because while the rulebook was somewhat intimidating, the gameplay is not super complicated.  

Very cool card interactions, and a lot of interesting choices.  We messed a few things up our first game, so would really like to play it again.

Should be in the mail!  Traded Space Hulk and Shear Panic for this and Earth Reborn.

Sounds cool...what's with all these super small print run games?  I dig the whole limited release, Kickstarter thing, but it kind of blows to know a game you think you'd love exists, but you won't actually ever get to play it...

You've heard about the art, for me it is evoking and beautiful and it does not distract. The rulebook is detailed,  and things make sense, tongue-in-cheek at places, the authors cover all possibilities so as a result it is longer than necessary and your first game may take a lot longer if you haven't read the rulebook end-to-end already. Once you read it though you will rarely need it, things are very intuitive and some intricate details are repeated many times so you eventually learn them. I like the excavating/collapsing mechanic, very unique and thematic. I have not played anything similar, for euro gamers there is some resource management when invoking creatures, or passing resources but there is nothing more euro to it, it is heavily combat-driven, deploy powerful squads as soon as possible and wreak havoc to wandering creatures and you enemies, aggressiveness and creativity in squad building is rewarding. An excellent game in my collection and a keeper

Update: I have played a couple of games and they just dragged for too long. It is in essence a resource management euro game with a heavy theme. There is a lot of building up before any battles and most of the time you spend is looking for resources to build up your army. I love the theme and the fact that it is an original game made by an indie company I am not sure it is a game for me though.

Thematically I love this game. All the art and the card names and the overall aesthetic is 100% right up my alley. I love the concept of it. But it seemed like the whole thing was a delivery mechanism for that cool concept and cool art, and not so much a great game. It never really clicked for my group, and it takes forever to play, so it never hit the table, so it got traded.

Absolutely stunning artwork, the components such as the board and pieces are pretty bad quality however the game itself and the artwork make this negative seem insignifigant and also kind of make it work giving the game quite an underground feel. I love black metal and dark games this is all that and more. I love the trying to build the armys from materials such as gore etc. This is easy one of the best games I have played I love the feel, the artwork, the gameplay. It really is in its own league when it comes to gameplay. The main negative for me is the board which is shiny paper :( light reflects on it and it is annoying trying to keepit flat,i can put up with the paper player pieces but the board deffo needs a upgrade....which you can actually buy amounted board

Only one play, but loved every minute of it.  Sadly, my Ogre Lord was extremely short-lived, due to a certain misprinted Crystal Shield.  

I hope I get to use him in another game sometime!  One game was enough for me to want to purchase it, even at $105.  This is a limited print run, and won't be printed again according to the publishers.

04/14 This is at least an 8. I have only played it a couple times. I love the high-school-heavy-metal aesthetic and the tunneling mechanic. The combat seems a little simple for the game style. I don't think I like how powerful the individual necromancer powers are...they seem to dictate strategy a bit too much.

07/17 Bumping up to a 9. There is no better game when it comes to pure theme immersion. Still bothered by the extremes of the necromancer powers, so we just house rule that all the necromancers have the same power (4 item use ability).

RATING: 10
This is really something special. To look at the components in the pictures of a game being played, it might look like a black and grey disorganized pile of cardboard chits and cards. There is some serious game here, though, folks.

It's not hard to sell anyone on the immersive nature of the theme; how you really feel like a cutthroat necromancer invoking his hellions to send them out to wreak evil. What I can say that's not apparent is you've got a sandbox of different mechanics to employ to direct the way you want to approach the game. You can build up your resource engine through digging for resources. You can invest in some serious pain dealers to go out and chop up your opponents. You can open up new paths on the board which changes the strategic and tactical options. You can develop different squads, creating different powerful combos. Finally, you can draw from different decks, each of which change the game state in small to serious ways. As everyone burrows deeper into the game, the options open up, making for a more and more chaotic equation until the game ends in crazy fashion. A feast of mechanics is there for the sampling, all somehow working together, but serving the emergent play that develops - not the other way around.

I can imagine some criticisms. Being an indie game, the components are not Fantasy Flight caliber. I did pimp out my copy a bit with some colored cubes for the resources. Additionally, downtime and game length could vary significantly by group, I imagine. Neither of these could justify me ranking it below a 10. Thanks to the designers for being the most responsive, supportive and kind designers on the site -- and for making such a brilliant game. If you have the opportunity, grab it while you can.

Killer game. Just played a learning game as 2 sides.
An initial wall of info becomes very digestible. The production value is great, and the hex tokens are very sturdy. They even have a very pleasing aroma, like leather, fresh out of the shrink & punchboard.

I can see why this game is a grail for many folks.
I can see pimping in its future.
I can see expansions.
I can see a solo variant.

Plunge in, brother...

Game defines the meaning of theme - integrating the artwork
perfectly with the topic. Maybe too perfectly for my taste,
to the extent that it's somewhat difficult to read the 
fonts chosen for the rules and counters. 

As to play, it's a mixture of risk-taking and awareness.
If you can track all the complex mass of numbers on everyone's
critters, you can really make appropriate actions, but the
effort required to keep all that information in mind is
probably more than I can bear (ala Pax Porfiriana). When I
was younger, I did't mind ignoring things I now feel I need
to be aware of - but nowadays I find facing something like
this demands that I assess everything. Unlike in a big 
wargame (where there's more to keep track of) here you
can easily lose the game off not seeing something coming.
Again, that may all fit the theme nicely, but it is frustrating.

Multi-player, this game gets truly chaotic. What is on the
cards becomes less important, as players tend to turtle,
 unless they have an obvious advantage. Two player, keeping 
track of the information is not beyond my ability, so in
all, it works out fairly well either way.

I bought this game because the art amazed me. I've played about ten times now in the past eight months and each game has been an experience, so I give high marks for game play as well. The enormous diversity of cards means that you have to be versatile about strategy. Sometimes I have to play aggressive and other times I need to hang back and rely on a cunning plan. The game is fun, strategic and atmospheric.

Necro-awesomeness. 

Aug 2017 - relearned it with a solo session. The aesthetic could not have been more spot on. After you get the movement restrictions down, this isn't a complicated game at all. I haven't added in Protectors yet, but I can't imagine that's too taxing. Definitely added in the ability to discard held cards for a single resource. That's a good rule, it's easy to implement.

I see plenty of user comments that decry the huge spread of a d12 in combat. I get that. But man, just use a die with a smaller range. Simplest of houserules. Problem solved. 

 Lastly, any rules questions need to be quickly decided with common sense. Helps to think, "what would the DM do?"

Oh, just opened up Warcults. Wow.

Edit: Four players is a bit much for us. Sticking to 2-3.

Played a long first game of this. Quite tactical and the theme is cool. I overextended big time (as I often do) and while I managed to take out one of the other players, the counter attack from the other two players crushed me. Good fun. 

My only complaint is that the components don't make this an easy game to play visually (as almost everything is black!).

 After having played Cave Evil several times, I've decided I would open an account on BGG, just to tell about how much I've enjoyed it. I hope more find out about this game, although the theme is rich and not for those unable to resist the madness necromantic abilities will most surely induce. This can be overcome (barely) by constant thoughts that this is just a game.
 The multiple levels on which you can arrange your fighting forces and the dynamics involved in having your minions initiate the entropy that is inevitable... subtle genius! And with every play, I find, I miss my soul less and less. I want to elaborate, but you should just find a way to give this one a shot.

RATING: 9.5
Unusual hex-and-counter 4X-like experience that defies and outright rejects modern board game design, and that makes it a beautiful beast in my eyes. Granted, the eXpand is limited to increasing your army, but everything else that makes a 4X game is present. The theme is absolutely brilliant and incredibly immersive, and oh man I just really want to play it more. Only problem (which I don't perceive as an issue, but is still frustrating) is that player elimination with a wildly varied playtime makes this hard for me to bring out.

Two issues with my copy is that the box is damaged along one side and the top due to negligence from the seller. Somehow a card that was still sealed and sitting at the top of the box was also damaged as well, making it an obvious marked card when not using opaque sleeves. The rulebook is somehow miscut for four sheets, being misaligned and missing the bottom third of those pages. The rulebook can thankfully be rectified by printing out the updated PDF file, but the damaged card makes me sad. I would like to see if I can reprint that card to make sure it doesn't stand out from the rest of the deck it belongs to.

A fun skirmish game with some nice tactical elements and a heavy dose of random chaos. Thematically amazing with some kick-ass art that'll remind you of all the times you were bored in math class scribbling killer monsters in the margins of your notebook.

A lot of fiddly bits and a long setup time are the major drawbacks. A dense and complex rule book requires reading beforehand. Not a game I'd suggest for the squeamish or for people who insist on learning the game as they play the first time.

One play in, without using advanced cards or rules. Was a shorter game because I got my necromancer killed in combat. I enjoyed it, and appreciate the integration of theme (although one that doesn't particularly resonate with me) and mechanics while still providing interesting decisions for players. It's a fun game, but the theme doesn't appeal to me, and there are so many other games I'd like to play before this one. I wouldn't turn down another game though. I love all the unique art on so many cards!

Fun game. A work of art in itself. Dark, demonic, grim-as-fuck theme done right. There's enough downtime to administer your forces, there is enough random insanity revealed by excavating the cave to keep the game moving during the early developing stages (and throughout), and a very high level of interaction in the end game. It is very refreshing to see such a cool style and unique art.

For a game that features player elimination, it was actually pretty fun. I was the first one out but I enjoyed the tension of trying to improve my powers before others stomped me. Each turn you take a card from one of three different decks (a mechanic I like and think there should be more of). You can keep the card for creature on it or turn it in immediately for one of the resource types offered at the bottom (and usually more than 1 of that type). Then you can play monsters and items if you have enough resources. You make new tunnels in the caves to find new things and cut across the board to attack one another. Offense? Defense? Put one of my creatures to work tunneling? Keep the card for the creature or get resources to put this other creature into play NOW? These are the kinds of decisions you face on a turn. 

I killed a large creature of one player but another player had a crazy powerful ability that she was going to use against the 4th player. [i]Haha, gotta see this.[/i] Before she could, the 4th player took control of her character, turned it around and sent it over to attack my wizard. [i]Yikes! Not me! Go away![/i] My dude died and I was out of the game just like that. Could not have seen that one coming. Just have to laugh.

There's room for just about everything in Cave Evil in that the tunneling allows for a dynamic board and the creatures and items allow for a lot of creative play. At the same time, it's easy to get knocked out of your rhythm or the game entirely by another player; kinda like a NASCAR driver getting bumped at a high speed. You may merely wobble or you may crash into the wall. There's great tension in trying to get your plan in place on the board before someone else or an event messes it all up. 

It seems like the kind of game I'd like to play a couple of in a row so people who get knocked out can get right back in the saddle.

I'm really digging the freedom of movement and exploration, and especially enjoy being able to freely create & split up squads of monsters. Sending them out to explore the caverns, excavate & collapse tunnels, pick up loot, and engage in combat with wandering or enemy monsters. Possibly hiring or subduing monsters to aid my thirst for power. That and all the horrific death metal inspired artwork come together to create a fantastic necromantic dungeon-crawling experience conceived through the use of gore, metal, and shadowflame.

The first thing that impresses me about Cave Evil is the rich and consistently-executed macabre theme. There are over 300 cards in this game, each with its own grotesque illustration! The game looks like it was co-designed in 1983 by Gary Gygax, the band Hellhammer, and that kid from your high school who had to spend a year at the mental health clinic.

The second thing that impresses me is the sheer variety of game experiences Cave Evil can offer. There is a surprise around every corner in this game. The basic rules framework is not very complex, but every card you bring into play changes the complexion of the game. Just one card can often propel the game in a completely unexpected direction.

The third thing that impresses me is the opportunity for smart and creative play. The game mechanisms allow for a lot of interesting decisions, both tactical and strategic. Seemingly small decisions can lead to dramatic turning points. Minor oversights can lead to major catastrophes.

Be warned that Cave Evil is the kind of game where you will sometimes need to make rule adjudications while you're playing. The special abilities of the different units can interact in all sorts of weird ways that are not explicitly covered in the rules. If you played Cosmic Encounter back in the Eon days, you'll know what I mean. More precise wordings on the cards would have helped, but it doesn't bother me. This is a game of craziness and surprising situations, not a finely-tuned Eurogame that has been "balanced" to within an inch of its life.

The physical game components are generally good with the exception of the map that serves as the playing surface. It's a substandard folded poster. The folds don't want to lay flat on the table, and the surface is slick enough that the pieces don't want to stay in place. I recommend either covering the board with a sheet of Plexiglas or mounting the map onto an actual board of some sort.

The sheer amount of cards sprawling across the table, each with its own text and numeric ratings, may be a problem for some players. It can be difficult to see the details of your opponents' creatures from across the table - and tracking those details is important.

Wow. First-rate art, with tons of cards to show it off. Someone said it before, but I'll say it again: The demon scumbags and blood bosses and creepoids you'll find in this game will remind you of that time you stumbled into the Gygax Fiend Folio when you were 11 and totally freaked yourself out. 

Just two plays (one solo, one two player) but the gameplay seems solid and just unpredictable enough. I like the all-or-nothing combat system, and excavating/collapsing is a cool idea. Throw some Xasther on the stereo and play, oh dark one!

This is it. The big one. Immense replayability, surprisingly intuitive rules, lots of decissions and all around awesome gameplay. I even don't mind the rather contrastless graphical design. The only things holding it back from a ten are the rather long playing time combined with the fact that player elimination is the main goal of the game. But great for two and also a blast with three, if you can stomach the possibility of getting offed halfway through the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I like this a lot. It has a claustrophobic feel because of the tight quarters and the scarcity of resources. That makes the action a bit more subdued than I'd like, ideally. But that's probably a more balanced and mature design that I'm guessing will get more fun the more familiar I become with it, and the better I get at creating opportunities in the game.

The key to a fun game is to make sure you draw (conjure) regularly from the decks that have event cards. These events increase the action in the game and tend to allow you to beef up (hire/subdue) without moving toward the endgame trigger, so in that sense it helps weaker players catch up. Also: the more fast-digging squads on the board, the more exciting!

I'm not a fan of the combat mechanic. Too much calculation without enough payoff in terms of drama or strategy. It really brings out the analysis-paralysis in people, and in the end all the additions and comparisons tend to mean little. The swings with the d12 can be wild (which I like) but there's too much calculation leading up to it. SUGGESTION (which I plan to try next time): have every player keep an updated record of each squad's combined stats on a cue card. Players can refer to each other's cue cards when planning moves and combat. This will minimize the counting.

There is an amazing variety of events and monsters. The countdown to the appearance of the big evil badass in the end is excellent. The endgame is cool. Nice long game, but it moves at a good pace and it's easy to learn (but also easy to miss a a rule or two at first). Nice feel and atmosphere.

RATING: 7
I have not played Titan or Wizwar, but this is kind of how I imagined them for the most part from what I've read so I think it's pretty closely related. 

So I loved ALL the art, its different, “dark” and retro and reminds me of the good ole' days of playing D&D, easy to see why many don’t like it though. Loved the monster names and abilities and how many there were, loved the simplicity of a turn but that you still had some options. Also loved the potential end game trigger/timer of having a big bad ass unleashed once time ticks too much, if you have not been aggressive enough now you have this to deal with! I don't think there is much to explore depth-wise, but then you don't really need that in this kind of game (just mentioning it as a FYI) and it would seem the variety of how games can be shaped could make up for it. (there could be a little more here than meets the eye on first play too not quite sure)

My biggest hesitation here is the luck element might be too high, for me (not really out of line for this type of game though) especially concerning a couple of the crazy powerful abilities, which in a game featuring player elimination could be quite unsettling. Like one wizard having the power to just outright steal your character, and another one could just kill everything within one square, talk about devastating either way. These sound really nasty, and they are, but they may not be quite as bad as they sound and they create an interesting push your luck element as well (as well as some interesting moments). I will only know how much impact these really have through more play, and I may just pick the game up and find out, especially if the price ever comes down to something reasonable for a game with no minis. (I almost want to knock a point off for selling a 90 dollar game with fairly crappy components and no minis, this game needs minis! Thankfully they do include a boatload of cards which is good because they are the main driver here) The other potential negative is playing with 4 due to downtime, I have to think 3 is best by quite a wide margin over 2 and 4. If my second play is as enjoyable as the first this could be an 8 for me just for the sheer fun factor (read mostly an experience game) and potential memorable moments it could create.

-------------
Definitely sounds like more development and outside playtesting could have went a long way here (like 90% of the games on the market albeit it seems to show a little more here). 

Concerns for me are the downtime, very high luck and no fault (random) player elimination which I think all could have been tweaked in development (and maybe could still be now?) and it sounds like combat could use some TLC as well

Initial Rating: 5.5 (May 2016)

I bought Cave Evil about 2 and a half years ago. I don’t remember why I bought it, but I think it was because it received rave reviews from a couple of BGGers that I respect. Between the time I bought it and now I have changed a lot though. I have drifted away from most Ameritrash games. There are still some I enjoy, but the list continues to diminish. After I read the rules of the game (all 40+ pages) I thought that perhaps I would like Cave Evil, but I found the gameplay to be too slow, and the game full of luck and chaos.

The rules aren’t complex, but they are many so explaining the game will take around 45 minutes. The rules are intuitive to some degree The playtime can be up to 4 hours with new players. I guess if all players are familiar with the game it could go down to 3 hours. It is still a lot of time to play a game in which luck has such a high impact AND it has its fair share of downtime as well (while players read the cards and think their move). Having a high downtime is the worst sin a game can make in my book.

The theme is great and, in fact, Cave Evil drips theme everywhere. You are a necromancer trying to kill the other necromancers (I love it). The theme is very well done, from the paper map, to the cards. The art is also very good. I like it a lot. Cave Evil has around 300 hundred cards, and each one features different art (amazing).

Cave Evil is an expensive game, and the quality of the components isn’t the best. In general, the quality is ok for me (and I know it is an Indy game), but there are some parts in which they look very cheap (player´s aids, spawn checks aid, but most of all, the squad cards, you cannot see which squad is which at a small distance. The colors on the numbers are almost the same from a small distance). In general I’m not a fan of the squad system (similar to Ventura´s). In theory it works great, but in practice it is hard to see which creatures are going to attack you, that is, it is hard to visualize quickly and easily where are all the creatures on the map. To do so, you take time to study the stats on the creatures and that makes the game a lot slower. I know there is no way to “fix” this issue as the map´s hexagons are too small to have all the creatures on it. 

The decisions needed to play are not very hard, and kind of obvious IMO (they are obvious in this kind of game in general). Perhaps the most interesting one is the tunneling. With some luck, you can really surprise your opponents, other than that, everything is visible and obvious. 

As I wrote before, killing your opponents is the idea of the game, so combat plays a big role in it. Combat looks great on paper, but in practice I feel you have too much adding for such a simple system, that is, there is too much calculation without enough payoff.  At first it is exciting, but when you have played through many combats it becomes tedious. Besides, luck has a HUGE role in combat. You are rolling D12s and there is a big spread between the 1 and the 12. Anything can happen and I, somewhat, dislike this part because you can be eliminated from the game just like that, even if you had better creatures to begin with. It is very easy to get killed and in a game that can go for hours, I feel it isn’t fair (on the other hand Cave Evil isn’t trying to be a fair game).

The luck factor is through the roof. You roll for everything, the tunnels appear randomly as well as the other cards, so it is mostly luck if you manage to get better creatures than your opponents. There is no mitigation mechanism, the only one I found is that you can pick one face up card from the discard pile.

The powers of the necromancers seem to be unbalanced, but I guess that’s part of the fun. There is a necromancer that can kill you just by being adjacent to you (without any rolls). Players need to balance it with clever play, lots of luck and alliances. 

I love that each game has different enemies (similar to Arkham Horror) and if no one defeats it, all players lose. I also love the countdown mechanism to the appearance of the big boss. It provides a very high replay factor.

Bottom line. I feel Cave Evil is truly an unique game, with clever ideas all over and perhaps it is a jewel of the Ameritrash genre. It isn’t for me though, I have drifted away from all Ameritrash games, but if you do like them, there is a high chance you will love Cave Evil. I’m selling my copy of the game ASAP. Love the art. It is way too long if you consider it has tons of uncontrollable luck. It becomes very boring for me after a couple of hours.

Theme theme theme.  Is this the most original mechanics game?  No but it is fairly creative and the theme is very original.  I also like how fast it plays once everyone knows the game, and most especially I like the quality and quick feedback from the creators.  I suspect some will be turned away by the black and white graphics but that is the point of the theme: late 80s black metal which if you want an example look up the artwork for the first Emperor records.

Waiting for delivery via a rather circuitous route. Arrived safe and sound - very impressive components which make me overlook some minor QC issues. The paper board is the only major flaw which needs to be sorted.

The future expansions which are planned are commendable considering the small print run of the base game - and i will buy everything new which gets issued!

Probably the most atmospheric set of (hundreds of) cards i own - all unique, the black and white contrast is excellent. The game isn't bad too.

(2nd copy aquired, possibly available to sell for an extortionate price? [Sold at cost to a friend])

2nd Edition copy, Upgrade Kit for 1st Edition, Mounted Board and an Original Art drawing now acquired. I kind of like this game.

RATING: 5
First impressions: 1 part Wiz War, 1 part Space Hulk and 1 part Titan; add huge amounts of necromantic theme and some resource management and you get Cave Evil.  Even though it's independently published I found the modular board pieces, chits and cards to be good quality.  The rule book is thorough with only a few minor typos.  Summoning with resources, wandering monsters, items, spells and variable endgame scenarios; this game has enough RPG elements for endless replayability.  A contender for game of the year (if anyone knew about it)! 

Update: traded as it never got played.  Initial gushing over the theme waned.  Component quality irked over time.  Errata irked (read: rules ambiguities).  Player elimination made this a hard sell for my group.  Amusing that scarcity has driven the price up to Space Hulk levels: anticipate waves of buyers' remorse to come...

A game which is unashamedly ameritrash, with metal stylings, and plenty of unbalanced cards arriving.  Luck plays a big part, but it simply oozes theme.  Happy to have tried this one and would be open to playing it again.  I think a three payer game would be a very different beast.

A bit hard for me to rate.  As a game, it does not have a brilliant new design and is a player elimination game.  But, this game is a ton of fun.  Hundreds of individually illustrated cards, most with special abilities, random events, dramatically morphing map, big baddies threatening, and theme, theme, theme.  Some of the illustrations are straight out of 70's metal albums, but still amusing in their sincerity.  Glad to have decided to buy this in Essen '12 (one of last 2 copies).

Warning: Biased rating through great sympathy for the game's conception! But let's put it straight: This is "Black Metal - the Board Game". Underground lo-fi demotape style black metal, mind you.

Some single game components are just plain coloured 120 gramm paper instead of the usual card board, and the artwork despite its uniqueness seems a little bit unprofessional; yet still, that's all 100 % true to the idea and doesn't bother me at all, on the contrary: a polished professional production would take away some the game's charm.

Ugly, Ugly, Ugly. I can't understand all the high ratings. This a hideously ugly game. I can respect whoever likes the style of the graphic design even if I can't understand how anyone actually can like it's utterly ugliness. 

BUT, I don't know how I could respect the high rating AND positve comments about the mechanics. With a decent graphic design it'd still be an average game. Why? 

1. Too much downtime.
2. Too much administration. 
3. Lots of adding and adding in every fight, for a quite simple fighting system. 
4. Too much randomness. 
5. The graphic design makes it very difficult to play smoothly: 
5a. Too small hexes compared to what is supposed to fit there. 
5b. Extremely difficult font, makes it difficult to read. ("Well", says everyone who gave it a 10, "its thematic". "Well", I say, "even if you like this hideous design you'd like it to be playable?)
5c. No hexes in the middle of the "board" where most of the action is. 
6. Eliminating.
7. Cheap, poor quality playing pieces that work very poorly.

And it's such an ugly, ugly, hideous, colorless, boring, depressing grafic design. Not to mention how ugly it is.

Awesome game that had a bit of a rough first play. Artwork is outstanding but the cards and some of the color choices made it REALLY, REALLY hard to read. It's like how much more black can you go...none, none more black.

Plan on using the "Turbonecro" variant next time. The beginning of the game seems kind of slow otherwise. Not a whole lot to do if you only have a couple resources. I will be using the advanced card discard rule. Getting an extra resource for a "dead" card in your hand can be a life saver.

Neat game mired with rules complexities and weird interactions. You can spend some time building up your army getting ready for confrontation and then a pile of goop with a bomb runs up to you and explodes and your game is over. There goes 3+ hours! 

Tough to figure out what to do sometimes with many interactions; rulebook encourages "cave logic". Good to shut up rules lawyers, bad to satisfyingly play.

Nice tactical game, with a different theme and a good amount of Ameritrash goodness.

One of the best board-game captures of Dungeon Keeper. It's a pity about the player elimination as, in a multi-hour game, that really does stop it being played by more than two. Two player, however, is still a great game.

RATING: 8.9
Absolutely fantastic game, I have never seen a game like it. Tunneling through the pits of hell to find and kill your opponents dark creatures, it is extremely strategic and brimming with theme. Most things seem completely original to me, including collecting the gore of your dead enemies to turn it back into new creations of your own! The tunneling adds a huge level of strategy because it is how can "sneak" behind and ambush your prey, or even collapse the tunnels on top of them!. The innovative battle system makes you compare stats but in changing ways that are intuitive and adds huge replay value.  I only give this less than a 10 because it takes a bit to learn because there are so many new mechanics. But once you play it, its not hard to teach and enjoy with anyone!  My only other qualm is that for the game brimming with art, the tokens to represent your squad are a bit dull, (roman numerals).  The quality of the game is fine enough considering how much is in it. I highly recommend any of Nate Hayden's games, if you are looking for a surprise off the beaten path!

This is going to be a tough game to review because there's a lot of different aspects to the gameplay experience and they vary.

Art/theme
This is what the game does best, the art style is fantastic, and fits the theme perfectly. One of the best looking games I've ever played.

Components
This is a mixed bag, the cards are sturdy, but they're kind of that "too sturdy" type of card, also being mostly black they get marked up with hand oils and the edges show wear faster. 

moving paper chits around a map? give me a stand at least. give my necromancer piece art! not just a paper slip that says "N". the "board" is sort of messy.

Gameplay
This game plays like a cross between Warcraft and Runebound. You collect resources to summon monsters into groups to either fight for you, harvest resources, or explore. The biggest problem is collecting resources takes forever/is too random. You can send a team of brutes out to kill, thus collecting the gore resource, but there's no predictable way to harvest metal or flame.

This game has a lot of cool ideas and was pretty enjoyable, but I can't decide what player count I'd like for it. Four was too many, too much time between turns. Two sounds like it might be too dull (total speculation, but this is a last man standing game and doesn't feel like it's outstanding as a duel). Maybe it's best with three, but I worry it'll play out like three player Wiz War.

Anyway I hope to play this again as I found the squad based resource collecting aspect really cool (along with the art, duh), but overall I feel the rest of the game is a worse Runebound.

RATING: 4
Artwork and theme are never deal-breakers for me, but jeez, I swear my cones turned off after staring at this steamin' black-and-white pile for 2 hours. I was making these kinds of doodles in middle school on that black material you etch out of... and (my teachers and) I give my artwork a C-. On theme, rather than having necromancers invoke critters and minions that excavate, mine and fight, I'd have been perfectly fine with generic hero fantasy theme in a setting I like, plus token heroine in skimpy leather. And Necromonks, which everybody starts with, look too much like KKK. Makes me feel like this is a white-supremacist game.

This is the premise of Wiz-War, complicated and bogged down in the same way as the excesses of Mage Knight Board Game. Necromancers command up to 6 Squads of Creatures (including themselves). Summon Creatures into Squads, then split and merge them however you want in Squads so they can go Excavate to find more resources or hire/subdue more Creatures, and bring these resources back to the Necromancer to rinse and repeat. It's like an RTS video game, with the Necromancer being a mobile construction center. This implementation, with the separation of Squads, makes it stand out a little more from MK, which avatar-izes you with only 1 figure.

Two cool ideas in here:

1. Excavating, which takes time, but adds an exploration aspect, and often disturbs the deep. You can even choose to collapse the ceiling if your enemy is close. On the downside, it is a little too slow for my tastes, and the components aren't suited very well for overlapping hexes.

2. The goal. Win by being last Necromancer standing, or more commonly, you find out halfway through the game how to win when the random Ancient Evil is Revealed, have some time to prepare for it and seize the advantage, before the Ancient Evil is Awakened. This often involves a ridiculously powerful Creature which goes around hunting you, and you must kill him before the others. Or take too long and everybody dies.

Note: Collecting gore from dead Creatures as a resource for more invocations never gets old.

On the gameplay front, I detest micro-managing ugly squads on that monochromatic board (in terms of balancing their stats and composition, keeping track of who can carry and use what), with combat being a straight-up comparison of stats + d12. No tension, and nothing gripped me. The vast number of cards is nice for variety, but the care put into those and the theme isn't congruent with the paper map, bad-quality black & white printing (in rulebook and paper map), small unstable tiles, and cardboard fold-ins as tokens. Might have given this a second chance if it had some better production values to match the cards.

Player elimination: Not a deal-breaker usually either but hey, my first (and only) play, the big powerful Stabbist randomly went crazy and punched one of my opponents to death in Cycle 3 after I finished my first Excavation. Nothing she could have done [i]at all[/i]; she was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and the card directed Stabbist to an arbitrarily named Throne Room. Not cool at all, resulting in a completely degenerate play. At least it shortened this slog down with just 2 players left in the game.

One of my favourite games.

Obviously it's not for everyone, the intentionally dark artwork (Both literally dark and thematically dark) could turn some people off before they begin. But if the very Metal theme appeals to you, you're in for the best dungeon crawl I've played.

Summon grotesque minions of hell, dig deeper, acquire resources, cast Necromantic spells, and murder your foes by collapsing tunnels on them, or wage all out warfare and pit your minions against theirs. Awesome.

There are hundreds of cards in "Cave Evil" and each one has unique artwork.

The board, the cards and every component stick to a colourless, black and white motif that not only works on a thematic level, but is eye-catching when on the table.

Unlike most dungeon-crawlers "Cave Evil" is a competitive game. There's no one player working against the others as an overlord type because all players are working against each other, competing to have the most demonic minions, dig the deepest caverns, and reach the centre of the underworld; to defeat the unholiest of monstrosities that awaits there.

I'm darkly in love..

:devil:
"In the pitch of infinite shadow there's a black old goat fuckin' one darkest evil bitch.." 

E: I'd really like to play this gem more, much often, in some 'properly atmospheric environment'! sigh 

E: OMG each and every play is such a blast! LOVE IT! 
+ the greatest and the weirdest atmo ever!! Its 'mood' is sprinkling out just by listing the cards and playing it I'm so ghostly gone, elsewhere somehow.. (& 'certain' backround music is a second power!)

'Owning' this gem makes me happy a lot (inscription and a small drawing, signed by one of designers).. 
It's very-very unique piece imho.
Can't wait to get drown into scenarios!! 
I hope that one day (or night) there will be out that expansion..

E: many plays later, (ONLY'n'ONLY in 4P, eachtime it's been under 100 mins at most.period.) :: I'm loving it! (players' elimination fits the genre the best possible way ever.. I'm mostly into eurotrash, but this ameritrash just rocks in wild..)
..so dark, love the graphics.. maan, this gem is soo special overall! I'm gushng over it with each thought (and it has not much to do with a 'metal music' at all somehow, just a side effect-for me, I love most of music styles/genres..but the theme is pretty metal and unparalleled hehe.) On the gameplay - despite of some (often) crazy d12 rolls, there's a deal of strategy and a portion of cruel tactics inthere, no doubts.

RATING: 4
Heavy metal dungeon brawl where assorted monsters and items with names that must be announced in a death metal scream -- ETERNAL EVIL EMPEROR! AAAAAAARGH! -- battle it out in a dungeon. The charm is the unique aesthetic, but gameplay is extremely random: draw from wildly unbalanced decks, do some Top Trumps + dice combat where the potential swing from the dice will often be more than 100% of the base stat (e.g. 7 + D12 vs 9 + D12).

If you want a wild fresh-bat's-blood-and-pretzels game where the PSYCHOMANCER OF FIRE kills an INSANITY DEMONESS and uses her remains to craft a BELT OF EARS, then Cave Evil is the game for you.

As with many Ameritrash favourites, I don't particularly understand the appeal. The cards and rulebook are fun but the gameplay is not particularly evocative of the theme. It's just a lot of dice chucking. There are some awesome moments, particularly once the ancient evils awaken, but they're awesome by contrast to the surrounding tedium.

Great atmosphere and beautiful artwork.  The game is little complex at first, but once you get the mechanics down, it is a fairly deep strategy game.

The pieces can be easily upgraded, great game - ok components

Excellent atmosphere, grim laughs, memorable adventures, and widely varied gameplay. The first board game that I ever enjoyed as much as the dice throwin' role playing games that I grew up playing, and my current favorite board game ever. It's great to see so much creativity on display in all departments: Rather than standard elves, zombies, and dragons, you'll encounter or employ Old Mold Mouth, Scaled Stalker, and Dart Adder and many other creations that are unique to this game. Combat makes sense and digging and collapsing are great options. An incredibly immersive tabletop experience in which hours fly by unnoticed. Each game is remembered not as a game that I played, but as a secret and morbid war that I waged.

This game takes an untapped black metal fantasy theme and absolutely kills it.  I fell in love as soon as I subdued a creature who'd shit gore for me to use in my incantations.  More games could use gore-shitting beasts.

Unfortunately, my wife hates it and the others who played it with me weren't that hot for it, either.  Hopefully I find some others who enjoy digging into the depths of the Necropolis.

The artwork on the cards is fantastic, but the physical quality of the components is wretched. Really it needs extensive pimping to be playable. Game play itself is similarly a mixed bag of clever ideas and lackluster if not downright awful execution. This game basically ignores all the progress that's been made since the advent of Euros: there's excessive downtime, randomness to the point of making the outcome arbitrary, and worst of all- extremely poor ratio of time spent thinking about decisions to time spent executing them. NOTE: I played with 4, which apparently is an awful idea for a learning game if not in general. 

Anyone familiar with my tastes will already know that this wasn't going to be my type of game. But I feel that there was a wasted opportunity here to highlight some of the better ideas by streamlining the game and giving it at least passable components. The wonderful flavor of the cards by itself cannot carry this otherwise insufferable troglodyte of a game.

Game is reasonably well done but too long for my enjoyment given what the game is.  There is a fair amount of randomness and just not for me.  For a similar sort of game, I'd much rather play Mage Knight.

Fun hardcore game. Great art and amazing theme- and an online dungeon soundtrack for your gore wrangling...

First play really dragged due to a "resource" rules error.  Ugh.

May not play again due to heavy metal poisoning. If they changed to Katy Perry art I'd likely give it another go.

Game is true to its evil theme - probably the most demonic game since the Hellgame (and much better than the clunky Inferno).  It's really nice that the creatures, items, and spells are unique and not just the same few over and over.  The artwork is a good match for the theme.  Gameplay for a dungeon crawler is decent. The original player pieces are a bit too cheap and thin though - get the upgrade.

마운트 맵과 일신된 재판을 구했으니, 초판에 대한 미련은 떨쳤다.
다만 초판을 구매한 분께 배려 차원에서 초판 업그레이드 킷도 구매하였다.

Baroque, obscure, retro and fresh at the same time. Inno A Satana.

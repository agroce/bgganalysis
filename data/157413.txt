I got a chance to play New Bedford and enjoyed it very much.

I say that as someone who is primarily a wargamer and not a big fan of worker placement games.

What I really liked was the theme. And the fact that I could concentrate on whaling, while the experts figured out how to construct engines on land in an attempt to maximize their points. What I liked was that the strategy looked like it might actually pay off, and there was great uncertainty towards the end about who would win.

I also liked the art. Especially the muted colors. I could even envision the designer porting the basic theme to Japan.

My only complaint was with the ships, which I found confusing due to their two-color design. I was also told the designer was thinking of adding some more history to the theme. A great idea.

I'll be honest. I wanted to catch Moby Dick.

A great worker placement game for non-worker placement fans, though I expect it is way more than that.

This game feels so limiting. You only have two actions a turn, and almost no money. It's got some light elements of tableau building and role selection and worker placement, but I don't think it's the best version of any of those.

A reasonably well-designed worker placement game where you gather resources to convert them into buildings, money, ships and/or provisions.  (Slight yawn).  Once your ship sets sail, it hunts whales using an amusing "grab chits from a bag" mechanic.  

All in all, a decent worker placement game with a theme that feels essentially like I am simulating something in a game that history has not judged kindly.  Put another way:  hunting whales does not "poll well" across large swaths of the American public, and I am part of that large swath.  As such, personally, I do not want to spend my time simulating the hunting of whales.  

Thus, New Bedford is a curious game for me to rate:  a well-designed game mechanically (7 or 8 for mechanics) that happens to be using a theme I really don't want to be playing around with (4 for theme), reminding me somewhat of Rattus wherein we are asked to simulate the spread of the black plague in Europe.  Sigh,  really?  Going to go with a 5.

Our other new game on our Friday night session. This is a fun, easy to teach worker placement game. It also has a small gambling mechanism to it with the bag draws for whale tokens. Getting the right buildings (or using the other players buildings) at the right time seems to really be key here. I was able to pull out a close win. Looking forward to giving this another go ASAP, probably with Flo.

Own print and play.

New Badford is a quick and cleaver game. The game feels a bit like a mix of familiar elements. If you like games like Keyflower , Caylus / Lords of Waterdeep , Caverna this might be a game for you. The game succeeds very well with having a center board with the available actions visible, overall the graphical design is very clear and the game have a simple easy to read ruleset. The game starts simple , but becomes more and more complex as the town expands. In the game there are basically three strategies , build up the city (create synergies) , buy and sell commodities ( money) , Whaling ( points and push your luck). During a game you will probably do little bit of everything since action spaces rewards you for going there first with a bonus. If you use something someone else have built you have to pay interest. The game play only 12 rounds , scales between the number of players . Since you only have 2 workers and cant get more during the game each player will only have 24 actions. I recommend this game.

I've recently discovered that I love worker placement, so this is super sweet for me. I just can't seem to find any groups who are interested, so I am slow to get reps with this. I may move on from it sooner rather than later, but I'm determined to give it a solid try.

EDIT: Well, it might not be a SOLID try, but I did finally get it to the table again, and had a bit of a negative experience. I find the gameplay engaging, and I love how fast it plays, but I've just become annoyed with the misprints and typos in the book. My last play was soured by an ARDUOUS set up of trying to find one of the "thematic" sets of buildings that the book suggests (advice: just pick randomly), and it was a bad bunch of buildings, honestly. One caveat: I've only played this game solo or with 2 players, which I'm sure is not a great showing. However, my experiences with this has revealed that it's also a bit too light for my tastes, and as I have recently acquired Pillars of the Earth with its expansion, I think this will struggle to hit the table while I have a better light worker placement game that I LOVE which I could throw down instead.

I have traded it away, even though I'm sure for someone else this game could in the rotation semi-regularly. A bit sad I'm letting it go, but It's replacement is already on my shelf. Glad I was able to play it a few times.

- New Bedford: Rising Tide

For starters New Bedford came from Kickstarter and is oddly enough one of the few games that I know of about whaling... In this game you assign workers to collect resources and improve the town of New Bedford and launch ships on whaling expeditions. Rounds are pretty short, you only have two workers and two ships with no way to ever get more. There is a fair amount to this game scoring is fairly straight forward but can be effected by building tiles. I like the theme of this game more then I actually liked the game itself. It has some unique concepts, but I didn't think they were really fleshed out enough. Throughout the game I felt rushed for no real reason other then keeping the game short. I think I'd actually like to see the theme and mechanics carried over into a longer game

A familiar blending of some of the best elements of the biggest worker placement games with just enough twist and unique theming to help it stand out as a wonderful little gem in its own right. You can very clearly see the developer's hand in shaping every single aspect of the game, in a way that makes it feel like a work of art. At one point in our review ( http://www.printnplaycast.com/2016/01/08/pnpcast007/ ), I jokingly suggest that it feels like a "bespoke, artisanal board game". It's not far from the truth.

Excellent worker placement game. Love the theme. Know that it was controversial,  but as someone who teaches history at the high school level (including a course on Nantucket History) and has worked for a museum which has a big focus on whaling (Nantucket Historical Association), this game handles the hunting of whales extremely well and respectfully.

Interesting game all about whaling.  The game has a worker placement option in order to gather resources, sell resources, build additional buildings that add additional resources/bonuses, or prep/send out a whaling ship.  The big points are accumulated upon whaling and bringing back and collecting whales.  Some bonus buildings also offer end-of game bonus points, but those are pretty expensive to build.  If you use someone else's building, you pay them money.

New Bedford is a solid worker placement game with some interesting decision to be made about building the town or focusing on whaling.  Ideally you should do both, but in what balance?  This question is impacted by your opponents' actions, as well as the random draws from the whale bag, which injects a bit of tactical thinking into your overall strategic plan.

The expansion adds a necessary dose of variable setup in the buildings, leading to interesting decisions when the buildings you relied on last turn don't even show up this time.  Without some key buildings (like the Bank), you can get some really interesting games that are rich or poor in money or certain resources.

New Bedford is the lighter of the two WP games I'm keeping around (the heavier being Brew Crafters).  In addition to being a solid, quick game for 2-5, it also has a very clever solo mode where you play against AI captains.  I've probably never played this mode correctly (screwing up lots of small rules, especially relating to Captains' Orders), but have enjoyed the games nonetheless.

In case other comments would lead you astray, this game does not glorify or promote the killing of whales. It is merely set in a historical time period. It's no different than reading or watching Moby Dick. When there are games with themes I strongly disagree with, I simply don't buy or play them. And therefore I don't rate them. *end rant*

What you will find here is a lot of fun in a fairly small game box with nice art and components. It has a quick set up/tear down for a game of this nature with an ideal play time, too. More than a filler, but it never drags on. In fact you may want to add additional rounds on occasion to experience more of the options to be had. It also has a fresh theme which is hard to find in a game nowadays. To date I've enjoyed each play as have the half dozen or so people I've introduced it to.

I love the historic theme of this game! We visited Mystic Seaport in Connecticut in 2016 and got to go on a whaling ship and see a lot of the buildings that are contained in this game, which made playing the game even more fun. There are a few buildings that I won't use though because they can completely skew the game.

Not the biggest fan of worker placement games but found my play to be thoroughly enjoyable.   Pretty straightforward and easy to pick up; enjoyed both the town building and whaling aspect.

A bland and uninspired low-medium weight Euro[/size]

[thing=157413][/thing] played with the expansion [thing=204420][/thing] is reminiscent of a Euro from 10 years ago.  There is nothing wrong with that if the game was truly excellent.  But it isn’t, it is fairly average.  Go to buildings in Worker Placemnet fashion to collect resources.  Convert the resources to new buildings or to Whaling boats.  Sail the whaling boats and draw whales out of a bag.

If low-medium weight Euros such as [thing=34635][/thing], [thing=57925][/thing], or[thing=110327][/thing] had never existed, or if New Bedford had come out at that time, maybe we would be celebrating it.  But as it is, it is fairly pointless other than having a theme which is a little different from the norm.
I thought that this view of mine maybe just my old jaded mind coming through, but one of the players at the table is fairly new to gaming and even he thought it bland compared to other games we have introduced him to recently.

I enjoyed this more than I expected to.  I still don't like it quite as much as Ora & Labora, but we were able to play two full games in the time that we manage one game of O&L, so it fits into a nice niche for being both meaty and short.  

A little disappointing that so many misprints made it into the expansion, but props to Dice Hate Me for immediately planning to fix it at no cost to backers.  It will probably take a little while before I use the expansion, anyway - still trying to get a handle on the base game.

Really enjoyed this medium-weight worker placement game. The length of the game was perfect IMO, at least with 2 players. The 12 rounds went by really quickly, and even though there are plenty of choices, there's not a huge danger of AP. I thought the buildings were well-balanced and there weren't any unnecessary ones, although some would definitely be more helpful in a 3 or 4 player game. The theme of the game came across great but not at all in way that glorified the industry. The amount of extra stuff in the Rising Tide expansion, like the buildings and the Ship's Log, will keep it interesting and fresh for a long time. Highly recommended!

Played the PnP version. Great theme, which is fine. But the game was lacking something. There were mostly too obvious choices and too little incitament to buy a building, as it both took time to get the resources and the other players could often use it before you.

Not only was this game easy to grasp for people who don't normally play worker placement-style games, the turns began to progress quickly as our comfort level ramped up. There was enough game play to feel the theme, a theme that I loved, and so many different methods to win that when thwarted by another player there always seem to be options available to try something else.

I'm starting to think my professed dislike of the worker placement mechanic in general is misplaced because I keep playing these great games with it!

Light worker placement as a way to prepare for whaling trips. There are three or four planning opportunities to build up your boat and decide how long you want to whale. In the meantime, prepare to pay for the whales you caught while the boat is out. This allows you to set your own pace for the game. A classic German-style puzzle game where you determine your own ebbs and flows of your economic engine. All fits in a nice small box with quality components.

We recently bought this title and are so glad that we did. The materials are of outstanding quality. the system and rule set are amazingly easy and give a feel that supports the theme. We went on a play binge shortly after this arrived. I highly recommend this title.

Easy to learn worker placement euro with a neat whaling phase thrown in. Lots of replayability, even more if you get the Rising Tide expansion (not needed but it's cool to get all those new options and extra player stuff). Nice art and component quality. The addition of the AI captains is very nice too as I love solitaire-possible games, making it a permanent addition to the collection.

Usual Euro kickstarter - bland and run of the mill. Straightforward worker placement to send boats out to capture three types of whales. When brought back to harbor, you get cash or pay cash for points for each whale.

The "expansions" create for the typical Kickstarter imbalanced chaos. There seem to be some uber buildings and over the top synergies. Whereas other buildings are more ho hum. The costs to create more powerful buildings are more expensive, but there are ways to mitigate that and get them in play earlier. Once you get key buildings out early, it tends to snowball since you can keep going to those buildings. Other players can come use your building (sometimes only one player can go per building) but have to pay a dollar to do so. Early in the game, no one has money. So if you build the right buildings fast enough, you can take huge advantage of them again and again before the other players can catch on.

I think it could use more playtesting. I've played it 2p and 4p. Four player seemed to generate more stress and imbalance with the buildings. The log file cards try to help balance things by giving a player an option other than taking a low level whale, or no whale at all. But sometimes those can become imbalanced, too.

The four of us thought it was meh or disappointing. There were some issues with the rules but that may be due to the fact that there were so many misprints in the game. I am not sure.

Overall it doesn't really bring anything new to the worker placement genre except the sailing/whale mechanic which isn't enough to keep it afloat (hah!).

I watched the GenCon 2014 overview video for this game. I was excited, on board, and ready to back the inevitable KS campaign.

Then the video switched gears to the "Meat of the strategic options" the Whaling mechanism.

I understand, that thematically this is in line with the town and times. But it's 2014, and whales are endangered, and abused. Having a game that depicts the blatant destruction of these animals is unnecessary at best and teaching animal cruelty at worst.

I wish the designer and or publisher would reconsider this aspect of the game. Board games don't need to be 100% historically accurate to be fun and engaging and we as human beings need to draw a line in the proverbial sand, when it comes to simulating horrifying things for fun.

Very simple worker placement game, but extremely fun, and I almost can't say why it works so well.

Rule book is atrocious. It needs a complete overhaul.

How could such a simple game take me several hours of reading and researching before feeling confident to play?

Everyone loves it who I've introduced the game to, but I have sadly had to withhold recommendation of purchase due to wretched rule book and the (almost necessary) expansion's mind-boggling number of errors.

Still an 8 for play, despite wretched rule book and expansion's printing errors.

It's a shame (though understandable) that this game was criticised for its theme and some production issues because it's everything I love about a game. A town to build, ships to launch, worker placement, light euro, beautiful components and a small box. Also, and unusually, a lot of thought has been put into the solo experience with different captains as AIs, each with its own character and low book-keeping to boot. My perfect game (but not everyone's, I realise). Fantastic value for the price. Plus expansion.

Very run of the mill worker placement. Mostly well designed although i didn't really enjoy it very much. The sending ships to sea mechanism is interesting, but the luck of the draw plays too big a role for a game like  this. The difference between drawing a sperm whale vs drawing a right whale is far too great. Apart from this sending to see the game does very little to set it apart from other worker placement games, landing it at a solid "meh"...

This is one of my new favorites! The decision at the beginning of the game is do I want to whale, build buildings, or both! Usually whaling is necessary in order to score a lot of points but sometimes having less whales but using building really well can win you the game. I love the components and the artwork. Rules weren't always super clear (especially the solo variant) but overall a great game! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'm usually not a fan of worker placement games, but this one struck a chord with me.  You are essentially reliving the town of New Bedford, Massachusetts in the 1800's when whaling was a primary industry.  There is a core group of buildings (farm, general store, etc.) that are available to anyone from the beginning of the game without penalty.  You can also build buildings throughout the game that provide other benefits.  Some, like the post office, can be stolen from you for a cost.  You can alway steal it back (for a cost) which proved to be a great mix-it-up aspect of the game that swayed favor back and forth.  

Eventually you'll need to get your two ships out to sea to harvest whales.  I know, not an environmentally friendly concept in today's world, but even this animal lover can bear with the fact that this is only a board game and we're not really killing seafaring mammals.  Anyway, whale tiles are randomly drawn from a bag (three values of whales) and you can pile as many on your ship(s) as you want.  The catch is you better be able to pay for them when that ship reaches the dock as whales you can pay for are worth victory points.  Money can be hard to come by at times so it pays (literally) to save up so you can afford your haul.  

Without the expansion (which we didn't use), the game plays up to four.  We played with three which felt like a very fluid number.  Two is possible but I'd say the game would lose some of its luster in that instance (there is a solo option which I did not try).  I cannot stress enough how quickly this game plays.  There are 12 rounds, and while that may sound like a lot, you only have two workers each round and each of those workers can only do one action.  Strategy can change within a round and a single point can prove to be a big deal in this game.  With being taught the game and three people playing, the total time passed was maybe an hour and half....if that.  Not bad at all.

Decent enough game. I would have never picked this game to play based on theme. But a friend picked it, and thus I played. The game itself is better than my rating suggests, however, the theme brings it down. For my taste, the rating should be even lower due to it's theme. So I chose a rating somewhat in the middle.

Really interesting and tight worker placement game, you do not get a lot of actions (2) per turn and so you need to make those count.

The whaling aspect can be a little random in the tiles that are drawn from the bag, which feels very thematic with your ships potentially returning with a limited supply of whales.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First player has too huge an advantage. Too much luck required to get the rare whales and the rare whales are ~almost~ required to win. The buildings seem super-unbalanced. For a game that has very little interaction, its strange that just one of the building can be stolen. Very nice thematically, but I feel that the designers were too caught up with theme and cool-factor instead of thinking about if the game was fun and fair.

I'm very impressed with the smooth, almost old-fashioned feel of New Bedford, which conveys the Massachusetts seaboard feel immaculately. The general simplicity of the mechanics feel legitimately like they've sprung from the same school that brought us Puerto Rico and Cuba, despite being some 10 years down the line. To cut a long story short, there are some games that just 'feel' right. New Bedford is definitely one of those games.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (4 -> 2):[/COLOR]

[i]I played this at my local game group meet up and was quite underwhelmed. The comparisons to Lords of Waterdeep make sense from a game play perspective, but while I enjoy Waterdeep I have less than zero desire to play New Bedford again. The game is a complete rehash of mechanics found in other games with the whaling portion of the game being the one exception. The problem is that everything leading up to catching whales is the most generic worker placement game ever. Think of the most obvious choice for buildings/worker placements and you have New Bedford. Even the whaling portion of the game is plagued by the completely random nature of the tile draw. We played the whole game with everyone whaling and saw one sperm whale (which is worth the most points) other than that a lot of water tiles and the lowest scoring whale. This made it a complete non decision when choosing which whale tiles to draw. I can't believe this game just came out, it brings nothing new to the table and is honestly quite boring to play since all of your decisions are so obvious.

Then you have the art; the box art is excellent but it didn't translate to the game itself. The whale tiles are okay, but everything else is bland and muted. The building drawings are simple line drawings with washed out colors. I don't like to be so negative when talking about someone else's creative endeavor but there wasn't one thing I enjoyed when playing this game.[/i]

New Bedford is a worker placement game in which you're trying to catch whales for victory points. It's a multi-step process--first you build your ship with wood, then you provision and launch it with food, then you actually catch the whales, and finally you have to come up with the money to unload the whales before your ship comes home. There are also building you can buy to give you more resources or just do thing more efficiently, but these can also be used by your opponents if they pay you. This probably sound more complicated than it is--the game is actually pretty straightforward. The game was a little vanilla for my tastes, but I still enjoyed it as an easy-play option.

A game I missed in the initial wave of crazy so I was very happy to finally get around to playing it. Nice worker placement game and somewhat push your luck also. Very thematic in trying to catch the whales. amazing quality and components to this game and worth owning just for all of that. Definitely a game I would play again. We were playing with 5 players and I think it was just a bit too long so I will try to avoid that in the future. I have mixed feelings on the promo card decks that we used so that is something to consider for future plays as well for me.

A relatively straight forward  worker placement game.
During the game you are building and using buildings to prepare to catch whales. 
Whaling is a a multi-step process - build a ship (wood), Launch (food), multiple turns to catch, then pay for what you catch. 
Money is tight so you are scrambling to get resources to sell all the while you are preparing your next expedition. 
All this in 12 rounds where you only have 2 actions - not much. 
A nice twist if you have money and another player can't pay for his whales you can buy them, but I don't think it will happen much. Like Thebes as the game progresses the whales deplete and you may not get much for your efforts.

A short and sweet worker placement game that manages to be wholly engrossing. The artwork is gorgeous and lush, especially the whale tiles. Though the ship’s wheel as first player marker and sperm whale as round marker are ridiculously unnecessary, I love them all the more for it. The theme is conveyed beautifully, especially when you begin to draw more and more open ocean tiles as you deplete the whale population (you jerk). My only complaint is that the box is so small for all the amazing stuff crammed inside it. Final verdict: “You must go to New Bedford…”

I played a 5 player game. I did not really enjoy this game at 5. I would be willing to try this one at three. Even still, it is a fairly generic euro. I find the system to average at best compared to many that are out there. I would be willing to play again at 6. And I do appreciate the new ship mechanism added, but I just don't really care about the game that much. Average at best is my bottom line. I can see how some would enjoy this game though.

People need to get over the whaling theme.  It's an educational game that also depicts the decline of whale populations as a result of whaling.  There is a lesson to be learned here!  

It's a fun little game.  The city building aspect has been a bit overdone, but the point focus on whaling has added a nice component to the game that can really add a bit of variety.   Points are scarce and that's a good thing.  Every single moves counts for a lot when 15 points can potentially win you a game.  So while game play is fast, you really need to think out every move to maximise your point value. 

It's still a new game so we're still trying to work out strategies, but we seem to be slowly moving in two different directions.  One with a heavy focus on whaling, the other with a heavy focus on the city and purchasing whales other's cannot keep.  

There's enough buildings in the game to provide enough variety to keep the game interesting and prevent meta-strategy.

However... and this important...  There are a few too many misprints in both the rule book and on the tiles and these have major impacts on the game.  The developers have done their best to rectify this, but there's still a large chance you'll have a copy with the misprints. These are huge mistakes that have major effects on game play if you don't already know about them.  Huge oversight on the production team.

If you can and are willing to find and fix the mistakes yourself then go ahead and get this game.  It's a lot of fun and it's otherwise beautifully made.  If not, buy Puerto Rico and call it a day.

I'm not one who gets particularly interested in the theme of a game, but I like this theme.  It's historical significance, the consequences of whaling too much and the economy constructed by whaling are all very real in this game.

Worker placement is my favorite mechanism and I'm always happy to play this game.  It's relatively quick for as much depth of strategy is available.

Focusing on whaling is a viable option for victory, but so is focusing on building, or a combination of both.  I've never played a game where the point spread was more than 3 or 4 between any two players.  It's a tight game.

My only negative criticism is that the setup and tear down can take more time than I'd like.  Depending on the player count you'll need a certain number of building tiles from select groups of available building tiles (i.e. 4 from the 2 player group and 4 from the 3+ player group, then 2 victory buildings from the base game and 2 from the expansion, etc).

I really like this game and it's gone over well with everyone I've introduced it to.

This game is slightly lighter than many worker placement games and its has too much errata. But I'm still giving it a '7' because it has a good, breezy feel to it.

It's fun building up to the point where you launch your ships, then seeing how they do!

But the game can also feel a bit arbitrary/ You tend to build whatever you can afford at the time (rather than making more strategic building choices) and hope you win.

Gameplay is enjoyably lean. It has a strong (if edgy) theme and feels like a mini-simulation.

I've played it four times - once each of solo,  3 player, 4 player and 5 player. I've never played it without the Rising Tide expansion, which fills out the game perfectly.

It has many similarities to Lords of Waterdeep's Skullport expansion, although I find New Bedford flows better and is less fiddly to play (apart from the annoying setup). 

The engine-building and player-blocking aspects feel fairly gentle compared to most worker placement games. This creates a pleasant experience because it can seem like you always have good options. This is an illusion! The game actually constantly gives bigger benefits to players who wisely place their meeples on in-demand spaces first and who change priorities at the right times.

Having said that, there aren't many clever things you can do to get ahead (apart from managing your resources sensibly) so you may feel like the game is playing you. Presumably the smarter you all play it, the more the winner is determined by the luck of drawing whale tokens (see below). Which isn't great.

The lovely 'ocean track' part of the game has a fun 'push your luck' element. The further you manage to 'launch' your ship(s) - which costs recources - the longer it will spend at sea grabbing Victory Points (whales). You have to buy those Victory Points when your ship returns, so make sure you have enough cash or other players are allowed to buy them instead! The relative position of players' ships is also important (you want to be at the front). So too is the amount of whales left in the bag (which diminshes as players capture them, leaving later sailors to find fewer whales and more empty ocean). Some buildings can be created that can adjust the positions of ships out at sea. So there are several interesting factors to consider when timing the launches of your ships.

The game is much more tactical than strategic but you still can try different approaches to winning. A balanced approach is probably most sensible but players can also try:
- Rushing to use the ocean track earlier/more, to catch a lot of whales before they thin-out. Just make sure naughty other players don't block you from getting the money to pay for them ;)
- Avoiding the ocean track entirely and generating more buildings, which accelerate your game engine a tiny bit and are each worth Victory Points.
- Focusing on building and exploiting one or more of the four or five random Victory Point multipliers/adders the will be available, preventing other players from getting them first.

The Rising Tide expansion adds variety, a 5th player and event cards. I really like how those events are randomised face-up cards ready to be chosen by players, rather than events that just keep happening by themselves and slow the game down (as in Dead of Winter, Merchants and Marauders, Eldritch Horror etc).

Rising Tide increases replayability greatly because it means available building tiles (which act like upgrades) are randomised at the start of each game. There are 49 of those tiles and about half will be available in any one game.

The 'AI' enemies are good in solo play and can even be added to multiplayer games. There are four of them, each with their own personalities and flow diagrams to determine their actions. It takes about 15 seconds to resolve each of their turns, so they are incredibly streamlined.

There are big problems with the editing of the game:
- There is A LOT of errata. Even when the publisher sends you a free strip of replacement building tiles (which you can request and which mostly apply to the expansion), two of those cards are still missing the 'dice' symbols they are meant to have. I ended up having to be creative with a photocopier and glue to fix that.
- I spent ages repainting the player's wooden ship pieces (and associated meeples) so that they are more distinguishable from each other. I challenge you to tell the original ships apart in dim light.
- A few of the cards/tiles aren't clear enough about their rules (or contradict the rulebook), so I've added notes to them (on masking tape) to avoid debates or mistakes in-game. Again I'm mostly talking about the expansion.
- With the Rising Tide expansion, the setup before the game and clearup afterwards can be very fiddly. I've created my own printable player handout to make it streamlined (which you can download from this site).
- The rules are also confusing or unclear in a few places (I struggled to understand the solo rules at all).

I found this to be ok.  Wasn't overwhelmed by it and glad that I got to try it.

It plays fast and doesn't overstay its welcome, but not something that I feel the overwhelming need to play again.

Played once with 4P. I like the idea of the simulation of overfishing and the way ships move back to port over several turns. It's a bit vanilla otherwise, but probably justifiable due to its fairly short playing time of an hour. It's a bit forgettable overall though.

Beautiful artwork, XLNT components, solid worker placement and town building game with good solo mode and expansions. A solid 8. Rating & ranking may go up another point with more plays. 
If the theme bothers you, try treating it as whale-sighting trips in which they bring back sketches and artwork of whales they spotted.

It's a light worker placement with few ideas that really shine, and a few glaring issues.  The buildings and their costs are at best uneven.  There are a number of strategies that can work, which is good, but there are some buildings that are just clearly a lot better than others for the cost.  Also, there is a clear first player advantage that is not addressed in any way.  These things would be forgivable if the game was more compelling, but it is merely okay,

Get that satisfying, Agricola "growing from the ground up" feel with a simple ruleset and friendly accessibility. A big plus: You can come back to this game in six months and not need an hour to refresh yourself on the rules. Exception: I feel like the rulebook isn't as clear as it should be for soloists, leading me to wonder if I've played correctly against the AI captains. But I enjoy this enough to muscle through (with occasional consulting from the BGG forums).

Meh. The idea is neat, but ultimately the game is kind of bland in my eyes.

Like it just starts getting good and then it is over. It was an okay experience, but ultimately other games do similar things but much better.

Very streamlined worker placement game where players create the tableau of abilities available for all players to use. Easy to pick up. Most of the actions you can take are described on the game board itself. And whaling/overwhaling creates an interesting endgame scenario. Solid, hope to explore more crazy strategies with more plays.

New Bedford is a very thematic worker placement game about whaling. It comes in a very tiny box but packs a punch. The game is about gathering resources to launch whaling boats and then bring home and process the whales for oil.

There's a public action area that anyone can use. Typically the first player to any spot gets a bonus for taking the action. Then players can build personal buildings... which other players can use by paying a buck to the player. These spots can only be used by one player a turn.

One of the biggest things you want to do in the game is build and launch ships. You have two ships you can build. When launched you pay some amount of hard tack (food) to send them out to sea. Each round the boats come in closer to shore, then sea tiles are drawn. You draw tiles equal to the number of boats in the sea plus one. Tiles are drawn in order from furthest boat out to closest. Whale tiles have a point value and a cost value. You can load up your ship with as many whales as you want, but you'll need to pay for them when your ship reaches shore in order to get the points. If you can't afford to pay for a whale tile, then you "sell it" by taking half its cost and offering it up to all the other players in turn order from you. That might allow you to pay for the other whales you are bringing in, but gives points to other players who can immediately score the whale by paying the full cost (the first player to do so only though).

There are a lot of buildings that change the play allowing you to get resources more efficiently than the central action spaces or generating money (which is tight). There's also buildings that just give points at the end of the game and buildings that do a few wonky things.

This game was very thematic, and a lot of fun. I would like to play this again.

The combination of worker placement and whaling expeditions is quite satisfying. In our first game, I thought I was going to be crushed because I mostly had right whales in my ships' holds, but a key bonus from a building tile tipped the scales in my favor. I also thoroughly enjoy the artwork in the game, from the starting board to the building tiles to the whale tiles. When playing with two players, I wish that I had a bit more time to explore the various strategies associated with the building tiles, but this is still a great game that can easily fit into our weeknight rotation.

One of the best worker placement games out there, in my opinion, due to the mix of simplicity and variety.

Most worker placement games think they have a choice between overly complex strategy gameplay and tons of *stuff* on top - a huge, impenetrable pile of cardboard - or basic, simplified gameplay with much smaller amounts of *stuff*, to fit the breadth of the gameplay. Big and varied, or small and... small.

New Bedford is a gem because it gives you a very easy-to-follow, simple-to-medium game, and then throws barrels and barrels of *stuff* in there because it can!

Tons of buildings! Tons of whales! Lots of options! Did I mention tons of buildings, because holy hell. Especially with the expansion. But, then, also, you only have two workers you can use per turn, in a 12 turn game. That's 24 tiny things you can ever do. And it works.

More people should be doing this. I really respect this design. Possibly one of my favorite games.

Cons: There are a billion buildings and some aren't recommended for some playercounts, so that becomes a sorting fiasco at times.

Standard dude placement city builder that reenacts the mid 1800's whaling boom in New Bedford.  Whalers can use other player buildings.  The meat of the game is in the whaling.  Stock up more to stay at sea longer and improve your whaling chances. Random draw whale tiles can come up empty with open sea. Pay the lay at the docks to process your precious hold.

Decent, lighter worker placement game. Good variety in buildings and the whaling mechanic is pretty cool. Whaling seems a little random given the rest of the Euro features of the game but using buildings interesting combos can be set up. Reminds me a lot of Homesteaders without the auctions. 

I wasn't crazy about the rule when someone can't afford to buy the whale. I think it makes more sense for a legit auction, otherwise it's possible someone lucks into VPs. This is a snap judgment after one game but it just didn't feel right.

New Bedford reminds me a lot of Lords of Waterdeep on the surface.. but it seem to both play faster and feel less straight forward so I think will be the favorite between the two over time.  My first 3 player game had a clear mix of strategies with one player focused solely on building the town, me pretty much only whaling and the third player mixing it up.  The townie won easily when we let him scoop up all the bonus scoring buildings so its clearly important to mess up other people's strategies when you can even if its outside your chosen path for the game.  I was also surprised how easy it was to make enough money to process whales.  I think we only had 2 whales sold all game... though I suspect that could change with a higher player count.  I'm looking forward to playing again to find out!

New Bedford, if you can believe it, is like a thematic version of Harbour specific to Whaling times in New England.

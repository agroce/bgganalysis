I really don't get it.  A richly themed mixture of Dominion and Magic... that is absolutely unbearable to play.  This is my least favorite kind of game: one whose winner is not determined by strategy nor luck, but by the players' perception of who should be piled on.  The winner is not who builds the best deck, but who people picked on the least.  So disappointing.

Haven’t played it yet, but it’s ordered.

What made me buy it is principally the fact that it doesn’t t follow the solitaire approach of Dominion/Thunderstone. Hope it’ll be fun to play repeatedly.

I appreciate that AEG published with Nightfall another card game that isn’t a CCG. Think the concept of CCG is just a fraud of the consumer and despicably since the marketing strategy of selling blisters with unknown content doesn’t serve gameplay but only the profits of the publishers.

In comparison with the publishing-frequency of expansion sets of other card games like Wammer Invasion I think AEGs approach with 3-4 expansion/year is okay, but shouldn’t be raised.

Revised rating is going to follow after the first couple of played games.

I enjoy the gameplay but dislike the end condition for the game. It doesn't feel like it's a balanced system. The game can end at any moment when a single player attacks and deals 9 damage to 1 player and causes them to lose.

You play to not lose, instead of play to win.

With more then two players the game principle of handing out "negative victory points" instead of gaining positive victory points is quite broken.

With two players it is quite alright, but some cards are quite broken for two player games. Once they are excluded it is OK, but still far off from the quality other deckbuilding games offer.

RATING: 7
A rather interesting deck builder.  The chain drives all.  I like the private purchase piles - they really do help define your strategy and direction while providing nice differentiation among the players.  Theme is nice, too.

A nice diversion from Dominion, and with a nice variation/addition (the chain), but in the end it adds some complexity/fiddliness without achieving a higher level of game.  So not entirely necessary.  A nice diversion.

RATING: 7
A friend received an advance copy of this, and I've played it twice, so this isn't a settled score.  Nightfall is a fun twist on deckbuilding, which definitely stakes out some new territory.  Since all five of us playing were new to the game, there was a lot of randomness going on.  I think games between people who know the cards (including the all important moon patterns) and people who don't will be very one-sided; if everyone knows the cards well, I wonder whether the base set is going to be too easy to work out (in terms of analysing the important card dependencies).  Like any attack-based multiplayer game, Nightfall also has a rich helping of kingmaking, whinging and so on.

Update: played for one more session, and we're pretty much done with it.  The base set is definitely too shallow for a five player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
This is an inelegant and unfair game. 

The mechanism behind having minions in your deck is flawed. It makes draws much more important. The notion that this game is for those who want more 'attacks' in Dominion misses the mark entirely; instead you have a messy tabletop and strategies entirely dependent on your neighbour.

RATING: 5
Interesting game with an original chaining mechanic. But I didn't enjoy it terribly much.

RATING: 5
Magic the gathering type of feel, but differs greatly on how the mechanic brings creatures onto the table.

The idea of dealing damage to opponents to 'give' them wounds, only tend to make them stronger, as they now hold in their deck a card drawing engine. In that sense, a card advantage. Dealing wounds to opponents, on the other hand, is also the only way to make them loose the game, which is a rather interesting mechanic.

The strange feeling of your minions 'disappearing' after a turn of combat, takes some getting used to. The effects that your opponent's minion takes damage only and not yours, again makes it a strange combat system. In a 2 player game, it gives the feeling that the creatures will never die, if you block with a minion of higher health or with more minions. Thus exile situations only occurs in bad draws or bad chains.

The chain effects are rather interesting, but can cause you to loose track of what is left in hand during your own turn. Both good and bad.

Interesting attacking type deck building game. One that victory or lost is handed to you and not 'purchased' by your own solitaire action.

Play this as a 2 player game or pair team. Otherwise, it just boils down to, whoever hides well wins.

I like the game, all things considered.  My biggest gripe is that learning the game was a chore.  And unnecessarily so, I'll add--i.e. I think the game is actually somewhat simple, contrary to what the rules suggest. We struggled to understand everything, and I'm still not 100% positive we've got it nailed down (though I'm pretty sure we do).  My sister hates this game as a result of having to consult the rules so much (and, no, we are not dummyheads).  Setting aside rule ambiguities, I enjoy the game.  I like the thematic elements (and I am by no means a fan of the horror genre); I like the diversity of cards available, and how there are several factors figuring into a card's value (i.e. strength, health, chaining abilities, special abilities and cost); I like the reasonable playing time; and I really like the chaining mechanic.  I am looking forward to exploring this a bit more...

The game I gave too much to. This game was going to be my deckbuilder(ish) of choice, but it was just too hard to get into myself, let alone get other people into it. A very fascinating game, with tremendously deep strategies, that are just too deep for the genre in my opinion.

RATING: 6.5
This is the best AEG game I've played to date. It has a fun factor and the mechanics are well tied together. The deck building combined with the ruthless attacks each player delivers every turn make it a fun experience. The only drawback in a multi player game is the constant attack against the most developed player (= least wounds). This is not a problem on its own except for the last turn when usually the leader get bashed so badly that he/she ends up on the last place.

Although I already own many other deckbuilding games, Nightfall strangely intrigues and attracts me because of its many innovative mechanics, such as:
- drafting cards that only you have access to
- chaining system that keeps you involved even during other players' turns, and forces you to decide when to play your cards for maximum effect
- heavy player interaction
- simple scoring system (no maths required! Just add up the number of wound cards you have), which also conveniently acts as a catch up system for those who are falling behind

It falls slightly short of a 10 because
- I play this mainly as a 2P game, therefore the fun factor does take a small hit
- The content (in terms of number of decks) is relatively lacking compared to its deckbuilding competitors. 

The next few expansion will make or break this game, and I am really hoping for the former.

Dominion brought me into the realm of board games back in Christmas 2009. By now, I absolutely despise it (seriously don't know why I whished for the Prosperity Expansion - did not feel the desire to play it even once so far).

Looks like Nightfall is addressing all the issues I'm having with Dominion:

- hardly any player interaction (and most of the "interactive" cards are totally annoying to act out)

- lots of downtime as the game progresses. 

- bad storage 


So I'm having high hopes for this one.

Wahrscheinlich muss man das Spiel häufig genug gespielt haben um die Farb-Ketten gewinnbringend einplanen zu können. Schon das Basisspiel hat so viele verschiedene Karten das es nicht leicht fällt schnell zwischen guten und weniger Karten entscheiden zu können. Das Thema macht es nicht unbedingt leicht Spielpartner im Familien oder Nachbarkreis zu finden. 
Was mir eher negativ aufgefallen war ist das der Aufbau einige Zeit benötigt bis man mit Hilfe der Zufallskarten alle Spielkarten herausgesucht hat. Wenn man dann Spiel aufgebaut hat sollte man am besten die weiteren Runden mit diesem Kartenset weiterspielen (jedenfalls wenn die Zufallskombination nicht zu ungünstig ausgefallen ist). Aber ich werde dem Spiel noch weiter Gelegenheit geben mich zu überzeugen.

It's...good. I'd be willing to break this out and play it whenever, but the themeing sorta falls flat for me, which is weird, because I love the horror genre. Also, while I've played this game quite a bit, nothing really sticks out in my mind as having been a "great" play.

Also, the opening 3-4 turns are boring as HELL. Like, just terrible.

I originally avoided Nightfall because I knew I'd get into 'collector' mode and never be able to find the last two sets which go for insane amounts of money. However, I'm glad I gave in, because this is definitely one of the best horror/supernatural card games alongside the old Vampire: The Eternal Struggle CCG. Strong deck building mechanics with a few nuances like the Private Archives (which only you can draw from, serving as a variable player power) and the card chaining combos, which I've somewhat scene before in games like Legendary (icon combos) and Kanzume Goddess but they work out really well here. You can't beat the great theme, even the intro short story is cool, the artwork is far better than I thought it would be; so I'll certainly be pursuing the other available boxes even if I know some of the sets and promos might be permanently out of reach.

Saw Mernaudo's video on this game and he did a very good job explaining the rules and now I have a very good idea of how it plays.  I agree that even though it is a deck building game, the feel and mechanics are very different from Dominion that would warrant a spot in your collection if you like deck building games.  

I like how each player gets a personal pile of cards that they only can buy from.  This rule makes it feel like that each player is following different strategies even though there is a common pile to buy from.  This is a big deal since most Dominion games I feel like they are copying me.  :P

I also like the chaining mechanic since it allows everyone to play cards even though it is not their turn.  It makes it more interactive and feel like turns are shorter since you are always looking if they are going to play something you can play on.

I also like that you do not discard cards in hand that you did not use that turn. This minimizes the luck in the game a great deal since you never have to suck up to Lady Luck to make sure you do not draw "Throne Room" without any other actions in hand.

They did a very good job with the catch up mechanic.  Since you lose if you have the most wounds at the end of the game (emptying the wounds pile), the wounds in your card give you special abilities that help you.  The more wounds you have the more powerful they become as well.  

The other the main reason why Nightfall is different from Dominion is that it is now also in the genre of multifaction aggression.  People will attack each other and with that king making issues arise.  Since gang-up on the perceived leader is now a big part of the game, politics and how well you convince others that someone else is the leader becomes critical skill needed to win the game.  Due to this strong implementation of multifaction aggression, I am wary of purchasing the game as it might irk me too much when people gang up on me.  Since I am the one that introduces my group to a lot of new games, they tend to gang up on me since they think I will win.
Verdict: Have Joe buy the game.  :D

What I liked:
* A typicial deck building game that does have some strategic originalities. 
* Two actual "periods" in the game: your initial hand is eventually out of the game.
* Illustrations.

What I did not like:
* Graphic design.
* Overall gameplay (although I played with 5 and only once).
* Theme.
* Many cards have similar effects.
* The abstract colored chain mechanic. It does work well balance-wise but it is too abstract to be incorporated in a thematic game. The colors could be substituted by factions or card types. I think that would give the game a great boost.

This is, after Thunderstone, AEG's 2nd try at a deckbuilding game. While it has quite some new mechanisms it ultimately results in something even worse than Thunderstone. The chaining mechanism is indeed something to differentiate this game but in the end it is tedious and awkward. The drafting mechanism is nice, but we are doing something similar like that for a year now with Dominion. Finally the 'take-that' component of Nightfall removes this game from the deck-building genre and puts it into the beer & pretzels corner (you finally know this when you get 15 wound cards in one turn filling up you deck of 10 cards).

A 9 with expansions.  I'd personally recommend Martial Law over basic Nightfall though.

House Rules:

Vampire/werewolf/hunters must attack only with their own kind, and destroy the strongest vampire if 3+ are controlled at the start of your turn.

Also: reduce the wound count by ~25% if Vulko is in the common pile.

Not perfect, but it's so much fun!  I think it's best with 4, though still good with 3 and maybe with 5.

Additionally - I do think the Nightfall base set is a bit bland.  Definitely get Martial Law, or wait for Blood Country and get Martial Law + Blood Country.

My two complaints: the fact that this is definitely a game which hinges on diplomacy or bashing the perceived leader.  (Though see my "thematic / anti-kingmaking" variant where minions can only attack with other minions of the same type.)  The second is that it can be a bit confusing remember who's turn it is, and unexperienced players definitely have trouble with what cards you Exile / Discard / Remain in play.  Easy if you are familiar with the game, but it's understandably confusing when you're Exiling some minions but not others...

As the game progresses, you seem to be encouraged to buy more cards.  At first, you start with a few cards you want to chain into, but then you realize you can link into these other cards, and that sounds like a good idea...

I do think there is a gang up on the (perceived) leader "problem", but it can be interesting to mitigate these effects with cards like Blaine Cordell and Marcus Toth.

Also, playing with a more talkative group makes the game more fun.

Keep in mind the order that things resolve!  Some misplays (not just mine) were the following: I thought I was going to Shock and Awe my own guys, but since my guys were earlier in the chain, that wasn't going to happen.  Another player's mistake was to play Leave Me when it wasn't going to have much effect - much better to save it for my direct damage heavy deck.

The game does feel like it ends a bit quickly - at least with 3 players.  Sometimes you don't even eliminate all the starting cards from your deck.  This may be due to Death Grip accelerating the game - 3 damage is nothing to sneeze at.  (Of course, Blood Rage would do the same in a 4 player game.)

Game plays quickly, but set-up does take a little.

While I like discarding my entire hand for more influence, it definitely pays to hold a card or two in reserve, especially if that card is a minion that would absorb damage.  Sucks being caught with your pants down with a Big Ghost hits the table.

Drop a Yuri if it means you'll have a blocker, even if it wasn't your Chain.

Games with direct damage (Death Grip AND Shining Cross, eek!) will end quickly, so don't necessarily worry about establishing that 5-card chain, and instead go for the strongest chain that you can get.  (Rather than buying weaker cards from the Commons, buying them up so you have them for later is good in a long game, but not in a short game.)

3 player games probably have more turns than 4 player games.

RATING: 5
This game is really quite fun and thus it pains me that it is so deeply flawed. First, the whole color chaining mechanism means that you buy cards based off the colors and not the function. This is a recipe for a relatively uninteresting game since once you go in on a color chain you are mostly stuck just buying more cards of the chain. It ends up similar to Dominion where each cardset had only a few viable plans of attack, but at least there you had to analyze card abilities and not just play a game of match the colors.

Then there is a matter of the number of players. With two the game is relatively tame and usually won by sheer luck. All it takes is a good turn for one player who then plays strongly on the other player's turn and if the other player also has a weak turn, the game is pretty much over. It doesn't help that decks are relatively slim in this game since the starting deck gets weeded out and thus, wounds, especially early ones, can really slow you down.

The multiplayer is more engaging but it suffers from bash the leader syndrome. Every multiplayer game has scores about 1-2 wounds apart as everyone shares the love. There is no possibility of defending against multiple players so it is basically arbitrary who wins at the end based on who didn't get picked on quite as much. The color chaining on opponents' turns works better here, but still feels more like blind chance than anything you can build a strategy on.

However, it does manage to capture the feel of MtG with its minions and card abilities and it has some clever ideas like weeding out starting cards and letting wounds be cycled for special powers. It just didn't account for the bash the leader play of multiplayer and didn't substitute in a quality 2-player game.

My concern is that the bulk of the strategy in the game comes from keeping track of the amount of damage that everyone has taken. If that is the case, this game will drop a few ranks.

Provisional rating - so might change if I play more. Disappointing is my overall feeling. I have a theme/mechanic disconnect, what are the colours representing and the chain? Then add in that it seems the luck of the draw is very important, yes you pick what you're adding your deck, but combinations seem vital. Didn't much like it with 3, need to try it with 2.

Just when I thought all of these deck building games were feeling same-y, along comes Nightfall.  A competitive game where the reason you purchase cards is to build chains.  It's not perfect, but its certainly refreshing and different.

RATING: 8
Now that I've played this over 20 times, I'll say it's one weakness is that it's easier to stop someone from winning than to win yourself.  That doesn't stop it from being a very fun and worthwhile game to play, because it is.  I initially felt it was better than both Thunderstone and Dominion as I felt it fixed the Solitaire feeling, but it loses some of the control in the process.  If I have four or more players I'd pick this game over any other deck builder, but for two or three, I prefer the other options.

Deck building game of much combat! I like the ideas in this game, but implementation sometimes seems a bit off. The chaining mechanic is nice, but it is hard to explain. I wonder if there aren't too many moon colors, as well: you don't want chaining to be trivial, but I don't feel there's a strong identity to any of the colors. Or any of the cards, for that matter: vampires and werewolves pretty much do the same thing, for instance. (I hear that improves in some later expansions. But I've mostly played with just the first set.)

Only played this once 3 player, so this rating is very preliminary.

Doesn't even approach Dominion in cleverness (and cleanness) of design.  Too much of the text is not obvious or clear in meaning.

Not entirely excited by all that chaining, and three player has the standard 3 player problems of gang-up, delaying (making it look like you are weak), and 1 vs 1 (giving the 3rd player the win)

So, eh... rating a 6 for now.  Probably much better 2 player, and 4 player could be fun.

To me this is going to have a pretty steep learning curve that may be effecting my opinion of the game. Most of my deck builders I compare to Dominion.

RATING: 5
Not my style of game.  I don't like games that require you to target the other players directly, especially with hidden victory points.  It results in a lot of time spent negotiating / politicking, which I do not enjoy.  The winner is the person who manages to stay "under the radar" of the other players and not get attacked as much.

Chaining is an interesting game element and leads to some interesting strategic decisions about what cards to put into your deck because you want to enable combinations for yourself but also not end up feeding colors that your opponents can chain off of.  It's not enough to overcome the negatives of the game for me though.

A brief update, I should mention that Nightfall is a very different experience at each player-count: 2, 3, 4, and 5 all have a different texture. 5 is pretty chaotic and rewards deck balance and image management, while 2 is pretty tactical and rewards building a deck that can easily cycle itself. I like the different flavors, but 3 is probably the sweet spot for most people. With 4 or 5 it's just a bit too chaotic and too long for most, although for me personally I'd take it at any number.

The iOS version is very good and I've been enjoying it a lot. It works best at lower player-counts though, 2 or 3. With 4 or 5 unless you're in real-time, it'll take too long with too many interrupts. The easier access to important information may in fact make the iOS version better than the physical version, which is unusual for board-type-games.
---
AEG has really done a great job with Nightfall. Now, Nightfall is not going to be for everyone, since it's a free-for-all beat-on-your-neighbor game in which there is a lot of fake violence and one player will emerge victorious. But, given that's what it is, it does a ton of stuff right. It's fast, it's sharp, pain is dealt rapidly. The complexity in the color chains is hard to get your head around, but once grasped, it rewards a player's ability to both maintain the ability to react to the opponents while simultaneously building killer combos, which is great thematically. The complexity of color-chaining and kickers is balanced by a clean and quick sequence of play and card powers that are generally straightforward, single statements. The victory conditions - fewest wounds - appear on first blush to be a bit sketchy, but in fact are perfect for what the game is. It means if you make an enemy of any one particular player, you're dead, so you can't afford to get into tit-for-tat cycles violence, the game system encourages you to spread it around and appear fair, which is very important.

I like Nightfall mechanically and thematically a lot (which is not to say that I think mechanics and theme are distinct, just that the vampire-werewolf apocalypse theme is not for everyone, and it does work here).

I really want this to be a game that Heather would enjoy enough to play more.  It is a deckbuilder that takes it to the next level for me.  The fighting, the chaining, the drafting, and the Avatars are all the thigns that make this game transcend any other deckbuilder, in my eyes.  I especially enjoy that I can add a new expansion each time, and it puts me on the same footing as someone learning the game, or a few games in.  None of us have memorized the cards and can just see how the combos can possibly work for us.

I like (not love, mind you) most deckbuilding games, but Nightfall was a huge disappointment! While it has some great new twists on the whole deckbuilding genre, it has one extremely aweful mechanic which I simply cannot accept: the kingmaking aspect… This is a huge bummer as the rest of the game is actually quite nice, but when a game is decided through negotiation and diplomacy and lobbyism and people who are just trying to keep under the radar, it’s not a good deckbuilding game! It’s all about sitting back and trying not to make yourself a target and to convince the other players that you’re not a threat… I cannot believe that some people can find this satisfying; you can win without playing well or lose despite playing well… Yes, an experienced player will have an advantage (as is the case with every game), but the advantage can actually be a disadvantage as the other players are more inclined to deal wounds to those players they perceive as threats. My point was proven even more so after my first couple of games in which a newcomer won an easy victory because he simply wasn’t targeted as much as other players! It just doesn’t work! Attacks should hit everybody equally. Oh, and I know that playing with 2p exclusively would solve the problem, but I rarely play 2p games and when I do, a game like Nightfall wouldn’t be high on my list of suggested games. I wasn’t crazy about the fact that you’re constantly attacking and defending, and that’s not because I don’t like the system mentioned above.

Now, I said there are some good mechanics in Nightfall, and that is true. Actually, there are a lot of things I like, but they are simply overshadowed by that one aweful attack rule… Oh well. The things I like about Nightfall is the fact that you’re drafting the cards you are able to buy in the game. I love drafting, so this was obviously a plus, though I have to say that in one of my games there was a shortage of a lot of the colors which meant that the cool combos weren’t used as much as they ought to. It’s also a great idea that you draft your own two personal action card piles because each player is then able to play unique cards.
The chain and kicker mechanics are awesome – I love that you can play a lot of cards from your hand each turn and make some sweet combos, and the chain mechanism also enhances the interaction between players. Finally, I also found it very elegant that you’re getting rid of your starting cards as the game progresses; this means that you’re not stuck with some weak cards throughout the game, and this was quite clever.

Nightfall first caught my eye with a review of the iOS version.  It reminded me about a book of the same name coauthored by Isaac Asimov.  I read the review only to learn that it couldn't be further from science fiction.  Still, it stayed in my memory as a very positive review.

A short while later, I was organizing my wants with the OLWLG for the No Cultist math trade.  I saw a Nightfall bundle.  I asked my partner what he thought of the game.  He was skeptical.  We splurged on the iOS version, which I quite liked.  I didn't get it in the trade, I failed to arrange a trade for it, but shortly after received Nightfall, Martial Law, and Blood Country in an auction.

I learned that I like playing it on paper as well as playing it on iOS.  The game begins by creating a library of cards available to all players.  The number is 8 less the number of players.  Draft cards are dealt to each player.  The number varies by the number of players.  Using these, the players create a private archive of two cards and add another card to the Commons - the library available to all.  After each selection, the remaining draft cards are passed clockwise.  This initial draft lends strategy to a game that would otherwise mostly be about tactics and reactions.  

Once the cards are set up, play occurs in turns that move clockwise.  The phases of play are Attack (other players defend), Chain (other players can add), Purchase, and Clean up.  Downtime is minimized as all players may be involved in the attack and chain phases.  

The card flow in the game was a bit confusing at first.  A player lays cards into a chain.  Each card has a large moon in the upper left, one or two small moons in the upper left, and a large moon in the lower left.  To create a chain, the color of the large moon in the upper left must match the color of one of the small moons of the card immediately prior to it in the chain.  Interesting tactics can be found in ordering the chain and deciding whether to place cards in another player's chain.  

The chain is resolved in opposite order - the last card in is the first card resolved.  Chain text happen when the card is resolved.  If the card was an action card, it is discarded.  If the card was a minion, it goes into the player's Minion tableau.

While resolving the chain, if the large moon in the lower left happens to match the color of the large moon in the upper left of the immediately prior card, the Kicker effect will also occur.

Finally, a player has two influence to spend on purchasing new cards.  Thus far, cards range in price from 2-4, inclusive.  A player may discard a card, getting one more influence per card discarded.  

In clean-up a player may discard as many cards as they wish, then draw up to five cards in hand.  If there are wounds in hand, they may be discarded for two cards apiece.  This can be done only once, one may not iteratively discard/draw/discard/draw.

Note that getting minions into the chain is the only way to get minions into your tableau.  It is these minions that attack the other players in your next turn.  That is, if they are not first killed by other player's minions attacking them.  Minions have a range of hit points of damage they can absorb.  Once the are fully damaged or once they have attacked from your tableau, they are exiled or discarded, whichever is appropriate for the card.  

Any damage your minions can't absorb spills over onto the player in the form of wound cards added to their discard pile.  The game begins with 10 wound cards per player.  The game ends at the end of the phase in which the last wound card is dealt.

Of course, there are numerous cards that can modify some of these rules.  The challenge lies in building a deck of cards whose colors work together, with the ability to play into other chains, and whose affects mesh well together.  All of this, while trying to assemble a deck that interferes with your opponents as much as possible.

Given the large number of cards, I assume this will have replayability similar to Dominion.

Nightfall gives a little twist about deckbuilding. It's certainly the most different from all other deckbuilding. The way to play cards (chaining), buying (claiming) and the cleanup (not discard all of your hands) to the final score (having the LEAST of "VP thing").

One problem is, the way to give someone wounds (-1VP) is to attack them. It's nice to be interactive, but with this system is VERY prone to kingmaking. No matter how good your deck is, as long as you're targeted, then you're history.

A simple game made complex by card text and interactions, but a very interesting twist on the deck-building genre. Persistence of cards in hand combined with chaining makes for a pretty cool system, although the box is IMHO about $5 too expensive when you consider what you get in it (about 300 cards). I wish it was something other than vampires and werewolves, as I think we've all have those particular creatures of the occult hammered over our heads in popular culture to a great degree in recent years (as I type in 2011). Expect a surprisingly difficult learning curve even with extremely experienced gamers.

Take a core concept from MTG with summoning creatures that all have trample damage that generally disappear into your discard pile on their next turn, add a very intuitive colour-based chaining system that other players can join in to and influence after the active player has finished with their plays (and subsequently the active player can continue) that also rewards additional bonuses if cards are chained with a certain colour combination and you have the most interactive and tightest deckbuilders I've had the pleasure of playing.

Later sets increase complexity and have far more interesting effects than the first set.

I think I'm just down on deck building games in general.  In my mind, the building of the deck is the work you do in order to play the game.  Thus, making the building of the deck the central theme of a game is just work and not fun.  The insane amount of expansions (3 a year?!) that come out for all these is a huge turnoff too.  I just get confused and angry at why the publisher didn't print a complete game right off.

After just one game I still dare say that this is a winner. Fast (moderately so at least), fun and pure evil. A real trash talk game if you like that. When we play we didn't really care who won, just in it to have fun.

In my book this is way better than Thunderstone which plays much slower and has many more random take that effects. In Nightfall you choose your won victim in most of the cases. 

Big Alpha is coming for you, where are you gonna hide? :)

An innovative deckbuilder, only distantly related to Dominion.  Players summon monsters and attack each other, trying to end up with the fewest wounds at the end of the game.  The card chaining mechanic means you are always involved, even on other people's turns, and makes for interesting decision-making.

So interesting and fun mechanics in 'the chain' and being able to attack other players. Yawn on stringing together combos of cards (every deckbuilder does this). ICK! on the theme vampires vs werewolves vs hunters - overdone and I personally am tired of it.

Game maybe had a potential but for me the downtime is soo long taking into consideration the playing time that for me it was not worth taking out of the box. 
What is more important the cards were not kicking often enough to make it worth chaining. The best strategy was always have a lot of "monsters" flood the other player.
I always was playing it with 2 players so maybe it works better with more players

I don't know why I hate this as much as I do, but for some reason this game just fills me with rage. It's mostly due to chaining, and how your opponents can beat the crap out of you on your turn then on their turn they can beat the crap out of you some more.

With 5 players, the deckbuilding didn't even matter.  The whole game was just about getting other players not to attack you. The chaining concept was unique, and the personal "kingdom" cards were a cool idea, but unless the game plays better with two, these aren't enough to save it. (Rating based on 1 play of 5 players - will have to reevaluate when/if played with 2 players)

So far, after 5 plays my husband and I are hooked.  We even raced to the game store at closing last night to pick up the expansion.  It was MTG tournament night, so we *really* had to want this game to put up with standing in the long line of MTG players buying one more booster pack before going home.  I think my husband summed it up best, it's a card drafting game where you get to attack  your opponent.  No hiding behind collecting points through defeating monsters in a dungeon or buying victory cards; you are straight up engaging your opponent and doing your best to kill them dead.  I did complain that I felt the theme was a bit 'pasted on' (couldn't this game have been made with anything but instead they chose the highly popular vampire/werewolves).  For that reason, this game is not going to a 10.

I think other people have played my copy of this more than I have.

I want to like this game more than I do. I like the chaining mechanic; it's unique and interesting. However, choosing who to attack feels arbitrary. You either end up king-making or ganging up on the weakest player.

There are many things that I like about this deck building game: a draft at the beginning of the game, no useless cards in your deck (ie VP cards in dominion, some monster cards in Thunderstone, etc.) good decisions on what to play and when since you do not discard your hand of cards between turns, and a very interesting chaining mechanism that keeps you involved during other players turns.

It still has some of my usual annoyances with regards to the deck building genre: tedious setup, lot's of card shuffling, and end of game card sorting.  I could probably look past all of this if it wasn't for the terrible end game game winning condition: wounding opponents.  You play creatures and if your opponent can't block them, they will do damage (plus some 'spells' do direct damage) which come in the form of wound cards you place in opponents deck.  These wounds provide a catch-up mechanism so they aren't useless to have in your deck like VP cards in Dominion.  At the end of the game whoever has the least wounds wins.  I dislike the memory element this injects into the game.  It also feels like if someone smashes you in one turn then you could be completely out of contention.  The argument is that if people do that then you can king make the person that didn't smash you, or you should have had a better defense in place.  My response is that I don't want negotiations in a game that is not intended that way.  As for setting up a better defense, the randomness of your hand and you opponents hand can sometimes mean that it's not possible, especially if one person is ganged up on by another.

While the color chain thing is interesting in theory, it falls short as a new idea. Matching big bright color dots adds nothing to the the dark theme here. There is also nothing that tactical about it; in a game with a lot of players, the color becomes almost random by the time it gets to you.

Also, taking a complicated concept from Magic (the stack) and making it the focal point of your game will turn off some light players.

On the plus side, Nightfall made me enjoy Dominion and 7 Wonders even more!

Nice idea to have a deckbuilding with more interaction. Great theme fit with undead who come back after been killed. The only problem I see is, that because of a big negotiation aspect (who to attack) and the radom aspect, you win or loose by chance at least.

I feel like this game would be great if everyone playing knew the cards and combos well.

(As of [b]1[/b] play) The first half of the game is extremely dull, and doesn't start to get exciting until everyone has rid themselves of their starting cards and can start chaining in earnest. Unfortunately, by that point the game is probably only going to last a few more rounds. Putting together long chains is fun, but appears (to the new player at least) to be the dominant strategy, with the result that the actual card powers are of secondary importance to the little colored circles in the top left corner when acquiring new cards. Also, in 3+ player games the main strategy would seem to be of the "keep track of who has the least wounds and attack them" variety. Not seeing a huge amount of replayability here, but will be happy to be proved wrong.

Probably needs more plays to appreciate, but I don't think I'm going to give it any.

Tips for Nightfall:

1. Remember that a minion can only block one attacker, but you can have multiple minions block the same attacker. Assign all damage to one of your blocking minions until it dies, then move on to the next one.

2. It's often not a good idea to initiate a chain on your turn since your opponents' effects will fire off first. Also, any minions you put out on your turn cannot attack until your next turn (since you attack first, then chain). If possible, try to put out your minions you want to attack with on your opponents' turn (preferably the player before you in turn order) so that they'll be healthy and ready to attack when your turn begins.

3. At the same time, you'll need minions out on the board to defend against damage. Think about when to play those, especially if the player after you is hungry for your blood.

4. Your minions don't stay out on the table unless specified otherwise. Think of them as attacking once, then going to the discard pile. Being able to put out a lot of minions from your hand at once is key to overwhelming an opponent's defenses.

5. Be careful with the "target" keyword in chains. Unless specifically stated otherwise, targets are both mandatory and non-player specific. If you have a card that is put into play and you can't target an opponent's card, you must target one of your own. You can very easily end up killing your own units if you aren't paying attention.

6. Don't be afraid to discard your first few starting hands for extra influence. Your starting minions weed themselves out; you might as well use them to get better cards before deciding to play them on the table. You never want to be in a position where your entire deck is in your hand because it's too small.

7. Don't be afraid to take a few wounds, either. You'll cycle through your deck faster and other players may leave you alone for a bit.

8. Pay close attention to colors for chaining. Every turn where you cannot play cards because you can't connect to another player's chain is an opportunity wasted. Don't end your chain with colors that you know the next player has a lot of; I often keep starting minions in my deck until mid-game to serve as chain enders since it minimizes the opportunities for my opponents to chain after me.

9. At the same time, you should be getting cards that chain internally. Depending on how many sets you use and the cards initially drafted, you can create recurring loops quite easily or not at all. And this leads me to my next point:

10. Be flexible! If your strategy isn't working, you need to shake it up. You can recover during the game through hate-drafting and careful play, but it takes work. Don't be afraid to switch into new colors if your opponents aren't feeding you anything you can use. Unlike Dominion and some other deckbuilders, this game requires you to respond to your opponents. Hit them in their weak spots, be aggressive, and don't stick with a combo if it isn't doing anything for you.

RATING: 4
Well well well... another deckbuilder, this time with a vampire/werewolf theme. Y'know, with all my distaste for gothic horror and vampires I still wanted to give it a chance - after all I could have been wrong.

Sadly, I wasn't. But let's start with the assets, shall we? 
Because every player received the same starting hand, limiting the choices of cards seen in the first couple of rounds, it went off slowly and didn't put us right into the real action. But once the first cards from the array were bought, the nastiness of the chain-combos (with effects getting resolved onwards from the last card that was played to the first, similar to MTG) kicked in. And that was something I really liked.

Unfortunately that was the ONLY thing I liked about this game. The bland, utterly boring artwork, the total lack of compelling characters or ANY background setting/world, no real tension at the table, the constant wish to actually do something useful with the cards just bought, and the anti-climactic ending when the wounds were counted... all that left me with a gigantic "Meh."

Hey, even a Count Duckula themed version would at least have been SOME kind of fun!

But this game sucks (pun intended).

I enjoy this game quite a bit when using an alternate rule set.  Using just the base rules, I find the game's politics to be unfun.  The gameplay of attempting to be the weakest player or convince others that you are all game does not appeal to me.  Luckily, this is easy remedied by using a rules variant, and the game is otherwise fun.  I'd give it a 9 if some of these variants were in the official rules, rather than being something you have to scour BGG to find.

A very good next step in the evolution of deck building games. Lots of good mechanics and ideas. Two player games go very fast.

Really love this game, how non-stop the action is, how interesting the cards are, and how expandable it has become with all the expansions. There's a great balance to the base game, and I dig how the Wound cards actually help to have at least some in your deck, so it is a balance to of course not have too many. Looking forward to trying the couple of expansions I already have for it.

Wasn't so sure I was going to like Nightfall--I am not that big into card fighting games. But I had a chance to play this a few times now and found that it is really quite enjoyable. The vampire-werewolf theme is old, but very well done. The game play and mechanics are very well thought out. That you can do this with more than just two people is a big plus, too. For the price, I don't know that you can do better in this genre.

I like the combat aspects of this deck builder. It is always 'go hard' at someone. The comeback mechanic of wounds is a welcome addition when you are getting smashed, but all it really does is let you fill up your deck with more cards which probably further ruins your engine.

The 2 player game is a bit weak (compared to my favoured Puzzle Strike) and multi-player games still have a kingmaker element to them as you know when you are out and don't have a chance to win but can still make other players lose.

2011
This game is not released yet--a friend of mine won a copy from AEG.

I like the deck building card games, and I like this one better than Heroes of Graxia and Thunderstone. This game is heavier than Ascension. I still like Dominion the best, so this one comes in second.

We played all games with 5, and everybody liked this game, with some liking it best of all the deck building games. 

A unique feature is the setup draft where each player chooses two card stacks that only he can buy, one that everyone can purchase, and one that is thrown out of the game. This adds to the re-playability of the game, and gives some player control to which cards are not available.

There are four phases to everyone's turn: Combat, chain, claim, and cleanup.

Chaining the cards is not new, but two things about it are: First, they are played one on another according to color matches. Added to that is the possibility of a "kicker" when an additional color match is made. Secondly, others can add to your chain, and the chain is resolved starting with last card played. Just like other deck building games, selecting cards that work together is a key to winning. 

There are three kinds of cards: Wounds, Minions and Actions. Minions usually attack and also defend. Some attacks are made on the Minions who absorb damage with additional hits placing wounds on the player; other attacks can hit the player directly, bypassing the Minions. The player with the least wounds, wins.

Also unique are 3 kinds of wounds, which become strategic when exiling them (removing from play) because grouping is important for gaining hand cards and breaking ties.

We also liked the non-fiddly feature--there are just cards--no wound markers, simply rotate the cards as they are damaged. I have seen this in other games, and increases the speed of play.

For us, the game never bogged down. Even though you don't know what you are going to play until a chain is started by another player, play was still fast. It also speeds up near the end.

What I don't like about all these deck building games, is that the potential expansions are never ending. When is enough, enough? Can be quite a money sinkhole. (One reason I have stayed away from miniatures.) I will be surprised if Nightfall doesn't quickly follow in the footsteps of Dominion & Thunderstone, with many expansions. I know at least one is already planned.

This one will be played hot and heavy, at least for a little while. I have pre-ordered it.

Deck-building with fangs and claws.  Meatier and meaner than Dominion and makes an effort to introduce a neat mechanism for bringing cards in play.

was disappointed in the first play after the great hype. White and Yellow moons look too similar in warm lightning, and its hard to see any mechanical link to colors.

I don't like being overly negative, however Nightfall is probably the worst game I've ever played (at least so far). Initially, the game starts off playing like Dominion, however for some reason that I will never understand, they decided to add the ability to play cards on your opponents turn, based on what they play, but only after the opponent has already attacked, so they have no way to respond to this.

I will admit that my lack of understanding of the game probably removes credibility from my low rating and awful opinion of the game, but my first experience playing was so completely negative that I will never play this one again. Nightfall just makes no sense to me - why do most of my summoned creatures just leave after attacking? Why does my opponent get to summon creatures of his own on my turn and then attack me with them on his turn? I ended up completely disgusted about halfway through my game and just wanted to stop playing. The mechanics felt extremely bad and gave an unreasonable advantage to the player who was able to get ahead first, but there's no counterplay to your opponent hopping onto your chain - your summoned units are just going to die in blocking his attackers and since you just played cards, you don't have anything in your hand to hop onto his chain on the next turn.

All-in-all, this was the least pleasant gaming experience I've had since getting into board gaming. I would prefer to sit through virtually any other game than this again.

This game is so fun. Fast, aggressive, and pretty easy to pick up. Only played with 2 players so far; I would imagine it feels a lot different with higher numbers. I only wish the base game came with more cards (or that I had heard about this game before the production run ended!)

Very fun game with a cool theme, I have played Legendary and DC/Street fighter deck building games as well, I like them all probably DC/Street fighter more than legendary. Nightfall however feels more of a FIGHT with attacks and chains and cool monsters. I liked this game maybe the best so far of the deck builders just for the battle aspect alone. Initial set up is a bit of hassle and the rule book could be a bit better wording wise.

A very different kind of deckbuilding game. Never felt like my deck was increasing in size due to the starting cards all going out of the game after use. Much more interactive than other deckbuilders.

I play the iOS version. I've completed 30 online games with a record of 15-15. I still haven't decided how I feel about the game. Maybe it's just because of how I play (and my win-loss record), but I can't shake the feeling that it's fairly random in the end. Most games seem to come down to getting the right five cards at the right time.

I'm also not wild about the "dot" mechanic. I find that I'm much more focused on the dots than on the cards and their abilities. It ends up feeling more like dot management than an epic duel of evil creatures. 

That said, I still really enjoy playing it. I'm determined to "figure it out." But I have nagging suspicion that figuring it out isn't really possible and randomness dominates.

I like the drafting, the buying system, and that the wounds are a sort of catchup mechanic--but I find the chaining tedious and uninteresting, and the direct targeting just gives me the sense that something wonky is going on.

RATING: 5
We like to play it with 3 or 4 players.  There are much better one-on-one games, so we will not waste our time on Nightfall with two players, although it is playable.  Each consecutive game plays better than the previous one, so it is a good idea to rank the game after several sessions.  

Pros: multiplayer, chaining (no downtime), table talk, diversity (no two games are alike, especially with expansions).

Cons: abrupt end, frequently a single attack decides who wins the game, the game ends when you finally can create longer chains, the later game chains get too long - more cards required to mess up with the cards before they resolve, very confrontational not for family sessions, the theme is pasted on and it does not feel as vampire-warewolf-hunter fight

UPDATE:

After the novelty wore off:

1. The theme is pasted on.  I do not feel like fighting with vampires etc.  The cards do not have "personality' as the moon colors take the center stage while playing.  

2. Early stages of the game play smoothly.  I like it that starting minions are useful, but they gradually make room for better minions as the game progresses.  Middle game is most interesting, because the chains are reasonably long and you feel you have control over the game.  The late-game experience is lacking.  The chains get too long, it is really difficult to remember all the effects, and worst of all we almost always feel that the game ends too abruptly.  As a plus, Nightfall plays fast and is engaging - no downtime.

3. Chaining is innovative, but see above.

4. Politics plays HUGE role in this game and unfortunately for us it is FAR MORE important than clever play.  Ultimately, you win by talking not conceiving a brilliant plan/finding the best combo.   We do not like it.  Plus the game is very confrontational and requires the right group of people. 

5. Left/right issue is also a problem for us.  It makes a big difference who is sitting next to you.

Terrible game. I hate that your starter cards just disappear from your deck when you use them, even if you want them to stay. A table full of cards for purchase, each of which does 3 or 4 things, immediately makes me tune out and pick the card with the prettiest picture (which was difficult, because I didn't see any art I really liked). The sad thing is that I won while doing so. Being forced to attack every single turn with every single monster you've got out is boring. The chaining thing is really hard for me to visualize with the little moons in a bunch of different colors, but I'll concede that that might be more of a problem with me than with the game. It seemed like this game took way too much thought for something so fleeting and stupid. It actually felt a lot like Quarriors to me, but at least Quarriors doesn't feel like work for the crummy payout it delivers.

Bleh bleh bleh. Do not want.

PS - It's not an issue for me personally, but how the hell did the publisher not notice that somebody with red/green color blindness could not play this game? Just put some symbols on the stupid moons! Or better yet, use symbols in place of the moons. The little 2 or 3 colored moons in the card corners look dumb. If the shoe fits, I guess.

Because the game is dumb, you see.

combos are kind of insane. neat mechanism with the color symbol matching, but thematically uninteresting.  The draft is a good idea, but the first card is a huge gamble, I think it's not quite balanced.  Too much randomness there. Tons of interaction, but you can't tell who is in the lead, so it's a popularity contest.  Probably more interesting with multiple plays, but I'm not too excited for it.

Fun game, I like the theme.  Would like to see more stuff for the different minions.  For example, stuff that would effect the vampires specifically, or the werewolves, ect.

Chaining is the focus, knowing how to build the deck that lets you build monster chains.  Yet you also have to know when to chain and when not too.

(Original Post)

I LOVE deck building games and this has to be my favorite. It is very aggressive and had built in combos. By far the Deck Building game that most closely resembles Magic the gathering. 
I love that with expansions that you can even play with the Starting decks so that even just starting off players can be tailoring the game to their playstyle.

Heck even the negative cards (Wounds) that traditionally are clutter in other DBGs are actually boons in this game and often can swing the game back to the losing player's favor.

The only negative to this game is that it has the steepest learning curve to new game players and I would not make this the first DBG taught to a new player. DC Deck Building game holds that title. But once learned a game that has incredible variety and wonderful replay-ability. 

Also the iOS app is a really good implementation... but in person is still best.

Yet another clone of an [i]ok[/i] game, does sound more interesting and interactive though...

Edit - Well after seeing reviews I'm pretty sure this game just won't be for me, I guess I am just not big on deckbuilding really, none of these games can hold my interest to date yet I love card games. At least this one did set itself more apart than the last bunch...  

A mix of Dominion and Magic mechanics (direct attacking, ganging up on leader, etc) should go over well with a big crowd though but you have to be able to accept that it could be a "perceived" leader, even if leading being ganged up on certainly isn't going to be for everyone (and includes me for sure).  

To me the Chaining while the most interesting and unique part, might just be the most fiddly part or definitely most convoluted part but apparently this is the meat of the game, surfing the convolution and trying to pick the right times to play the right cards. I'll still give it a shot if the chance comes up, too bad more cards and different cards werent included in the base game......MoooooooOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

Initial Rating: 6.5 (June 2014)

A fascinating take on the deckbuilding genre. Nightfall is a very aggressive game, but I enjoy it. It took me a long time to play it because, for some reason, I’m suspicious of AEG´s games but the game is good. It works only for two players though, with more it degenerates into king making, chaotic and luck prone situations. It also increases the game length by a lot. I won’t play it with more than 2 players.

The rules are easy to explain, but they offer interesting decisions (basically which cards to buy so you can efficiently chain them together, also how to block is important) and playing it well is harder than I initially thought (a huge plus in my book).

The art is good and I enjoy the theme.

It seems some cards are really powerful, I’m not sure if the game is unbalanced or not, but my gut feeling tells me it is, however it is very fun to play it and as, usually, both players have access to the same cards, I don’t mind the unbalance.

Bottom line, one of the best deckbuilding games I have seen. I dislike most of them (but Dominion is still the uncontested king for me) due to the tactical nature of the majority, but you can plan a lot in Nightfall as it has a static market offering. I want to buy all the expansions but they are hard to get and when they were on sale I mistrusted the game due to the publisher :cry:. Perhaps it can get an upgraded rating from me.

Current Rating: 6.5

That was a painful play.  Perhaps it's got some potential with 2 players but a multiplayer game is pants.  Other than theme, I don't see any advance over cleaner deckbuilding games.  I see useless complexity in the chaining & kickers but nothing solid. Blech! All based on one play but there won't be a second...

This is a game that some will click quickly, and others have to have it explained. It's all about building an efficient chain, and linking with others. A very well built game, it's just a shame that the combat mechanic allows people to gang up on each other, so that combat is more focused on politics than anything else. If you don't mind this, it's a fantastic game worth trying for anyone. Play it more than once before you give it a rating.

Major issues with rules and cards (Alton Hickman, the multiple kinds of damage and blocking, et cetera). In this game, it seems that there are obviously canonical rules, but they have to be sniffed out from the internet. Also, I thought the visual design was really immature in terms of visual weight and basic appeal, but that could be for want of ideal card art.

For all that, the game was a pleasant surprise out of the "bargain bin".

Pros:
- Eliminates the "wild combos phase" common to deck building games
- Chaining creates a "turn as a round" situation that engages players a little better than pure player turns

Cons:
- Poorly written cards & manual
- Muddled visual design leaves the game unattractive

Planning to get one of the more mature games in the same family.

Not as different from Dominion as Puzzle Strike, but more different than others in the genre.  Combos seem to be a HUGE thing, which can be both fun & frustrating.

I bought this because of the horror theme but was very disappointed that it didn't feel "horror" at all. It's just a bunch of creatures fighting each other. It plays well, though, and I enjoy the chaining mechanism. I'm sure after I get over my disappointment with the application of the theme that I'll enjoy the game for what it is: summoners competing against each other for dominance.

UPDATE: I'm enjoying this game much more now and have bought a couple of expansions.

I hesitated for a long time before picking this up.  Initially I was a "Dominion only" deck-building person, soured on the genre after feeling like I'd been burned by Thunderstone and Ascension.  Then I started playing Ascension on the iPad and learned to love it.  So I came back to the genre with some trepidation.

The big strike against Nightfall (and I'm probably the only one that feels this way) is its theme.  While I'm no fan of the "build up your kingdom" theme of Dominion, I'm much less into werewolves, vampires and zombies.  It makes it a type of game that I would refrain from playing with most people, including my children.  And the artwork, especially after perusing the cards in the Martial Law expansion, is juvenile.  Again, it's probably pleasing to those that enjoy this type of themes, but again, I find it embarrassing, especially regarding the cards depicting women.

That said, I went into the game wanting to like it, which doesn't happen very often.  And thus far I've enjoyed it. It took a while to get used to the system, but I think it's fun and provides a different kind of challenge.  I hope to be able to get to know the game a little better, but honestly I don't see that happening until the iOS version is released.  So hopefully I will be able to revise my rating then.

RATING: 6.5
A card drafting werewolf game that fortunately has nothing in common with Dominion.

The good thing about this game is that it finishes pretty quickly, despite the slow start (and starting cards). The bad news is that the chain/kicker system while cool in theory is cumbersome in practice. Its a bit annoying to constantly have your turn interrupted and to be waiting for other players to take "their turn" on "your turn".

Ok,Ok...
Crazy fun here...
The interaction is second-to-none.
The deck-building mechanic is realized well and with less restrictions than typical, making for a fast, brutal game.
Those who enjoy direct conflict will revel in Nightfall's awesomeness.
It loses 1 point simply due to the fact, that at times, especially in a 4-5 player game, the winner may seem arbitrary.
I don't care because the game plays so quickly...and I don't even fully subscribe to that theory, but I could see how others might think the outcome is almost random.

I will be a Nightfall collector and player for its full run; awesome sauce!

The flaw of this game: kingmaking/vengence. A variant can correct the kingmaking, but still there is a end gaming problem.

Although classified as a deck-building game, this plays much differently than most games in the genre. There's quite a bit of meta-gaming as you convince your opponents that you aren't a threat. The large variety of cards and combinations adds a lot to the game.

Hate the theme... Vampires and Werewolves?  Really?  Yeah that isn't being done to death at the moment or anything.

The Drafting mechanic to setup the "village" cards is awesome as is the personal buy stacks.

The chain mechanic is cumbersome and seems to exist more to try to set the game apart from other deckbuilding/ccg games then to provide any real good gameplay aspect.  The color chaining in particular is really annoying.

I'll likely play this game since most of my group like it but I won't be buying it.

So, I played one of the promo copies at my FLGS and it's an interesting game.  The color chaining mechanic is fun and the combat mechanics remind me quite a bit of multiplayer Magic, in the sense that you send out your dudes in any combination of attacks that you choose.  I have to admit that I didn't care much for the art/theme of this game.  At least it's different than other deckbuilders.  Also, memory is required to keep track of who needs wounds.  It's not enough to maximize your own points because your points are relative to each other player's.  In our game, another player was unhappy because he thought that I was clearly winning when he got targeted.  It turned out that I wasn't winning at all, so we were all surprised by that.  With all the stuff happening, having people clearly announce when they are discarding wounds seems to become a priority.  I'm not sure if I like this design decision and the dynamic of forced antagonism and kingmaking that it creates.  Also, if you have a weak player at the table or someone who doesn't care to play to win, that person can severely influence the outcome of the game by making suboptimal choices about who to give wounds at key moments during the game.  I can see this game working when everyone is relatively aware of all that is happening at the table.  Otherwise, tabletalk and negotiation become the winning strategy, as convincing others to send their damage elsewhere is crucial.

Disappointed after one play; the chaining seemed like a nice mechanic but didn't really work in practice, and the blandly serious vampires-and-whatever theme is completely unengaging.

Finally, a deck building game that does PVP perfectly! I had very high expectations for this game, and that actually made me nervous to play it the first time because I didn't want to be let down, but Nightfall easily exceeded all my expectations for it. The chaining mechanic is great and solves the problem of not having anything to do while waiting for your turn. The beginning of game draft mechanic is a great idea to make each game even more different than just having different common piles. Can't say enough about it; just an awesome and incredibly fun game!

I just don't see what the attraction is with this one. We tried to like it, but found it completely unsatisfying. It seemed like it should have been dripping with theme, but it just wasn't. The names and the artwork was there but everything could just as well have been generic. Deck-building is not my favorite mechanic, because it does seem so much like multiplayer solitaire, but Nightfall's attempt to make deck-building interactive just fell flat with us.

RATING: 9
This is a deck building game with several interesting mechanics.  Two prime ones are:

1) Each turn players may play multiple creatures/effects via chaining.  Chaining is accomplished through colored moons/circles.

2) Each turn players must initiate combat with all their creatures and discard them afterwards.

These mechanics keep everyone in the game.  With the first, opponents also have an opportunity to add to the current player's chain.  So even when you aren't the active player, you can play multiple cards with devastating consequences.  With the second, every round gives each player an opportunity to turn the tide since everyone has a new slate of creatures.

Generally, I prefer games where I am actually playing (instead of waiting) most of the time and I have a chance to win, i.e. there isn't a runaway leader.  This game provides that.

Surprisingly very good! I would say it a mix of 50% Dominion and 50% Magic the Gathering. The chain system and the fact you have to play very aggressively makes this game unique. I find the game challenging intellectually on how to build your own chains, be able to use the ones started by your opponent(s) make sure the timing is to my advantage.

The theme is pointless but so far, it was never a strength of deck building games to begin with.

The game works better with 2 or 3 players, with more, it only becomes a politic madness and will be overly long.

Update: I found out that 3 players is broken as well, this is strictly a 2 players game IMHO. The rating only reflect a 2 players game.

This card game brings some new aspects to the "Dominion" style gameplay that most card games are now adays. Basic idea but fun to play! Only downside is not much cards....yet.

This is possibly one of the worst games that I have ever played. Personally, I am a fan of deck-building games like Ascension, but this is just plain terrible.

The biggest criticism that I have for this game is that it's difficult to play the cards effectively and you have little control of what you can do. First, in order to use a card effectively, you have to have it in your hand, have it link to a certain color on the previous card (without being able to control the order in which you play it),and have it resolve it's effect in a way that actually benefits you and doesn't screw you over. The gameplay is random, and you're mostly just going to be trying to find a way to link your cards together instead of actually thinking about what your cards will do.

Furthermore, the learning curve for the game is steep, so most people will find this game to be unappealing. Even if you do somehow manage to get your friends to play it, you'll soon realize how blatantly stupid this game is because in a game of more than 2 players, there will be one player that will be taking most of the wounds, making it impossible for them to win the game.

I completely regret ever buying this game, and I am currently finding someone that will buy it from me without much success, possibly because they know just how awful this game is. Don't buy this game. Just DON'T. You will regret it.

Moves too slow for a deck builder due to a fairly complicated turn structure. Also too be light on the strategy / tactics department thanks to the game being entirely "balanced" by relentless beat the leader, due to which there isn't even that much of an incentive to play well.

Deck building, combat, what's not to like? ...I'm not sure really. I think it's that the choice of characters seem strange for a starter set - they seem like second stringers (thematically speaking). Seems to move along, combo-ing structure seems strange, though different.

7/11/2013 - Picked it up on sale and played it again with my family.  I enjoyed it a lot more this time.  I still think the follow suit mechanic is tricky, but it has some merrit.  My problem this time was that I am not a card counter and had no idea who had the most wounds.  I didn't even feel confident that I was attacking the correct person at the end of the game because I didn't know where we were in the count.

I just didn't get into this game.  The weird follow suit and the actions that happen in reverse throw me off.

Nightfall - a new fast, furious and fun deck-building game from Alderac Entertainment Group. Featuring direct head-to-head combat, amazing art, a new AEG world, and unique mechanics by designer David Gregg, Nightfall will be the deck-building game to own.

Before the game begins, there is a draft to determine which cards are available for purchase, and by whom. During this draft players select two cards from the set for their personal archives, and they also select cards to put into the common area. The cards drafted into personal archives may only be purchased by the player who drafted them.

Not really a deck building game Nightwish aims to adress also to CCG players.  The system of chain linking even though interesting at first, it however renders tha game somewhat uncontrollable.  

Theme is pretty much artificially thrown over the mechanics.

Learning curve remains high. Not really much of a problem for people who find dominion-like games shallow and repetitive.  But to those people the main problem is that Nightfall is not any deeper only more complex and uncontrollable.

At the end, some people might still like this game, but probably not many...

Dominion meets Magic the Gathering.  Pretty good game, good player interaction (unlike Dominion), interesting mechanic (if somewhat intense for non-gamers), theme is a nice change, but a bit long (quicker than Thunderstone, longer than Dominion).  Ultimately traded this away as there always seemed to be something more desirable to put on the table.

Not sure if I like it a lot, if not for the cheap price I got it from sales. The game seems to be hard to understand. The turn structure is awkward to me, with no specific meaning being attached to the different phases. Perhaps the subject of werewolves, beasts and vampires eluded me but the sexy female scavengers and slick music do help a bit to pull me back in. I can't find the rationale behind the lining system - matching colors of the previous card in order to play the current one. More time should be spent to dig out the strategy part. With the starter set, the combos seem to be limited in variable play style, unless you are willing to pay for more in-app purchases.

RATING: 6
* Interpretation of the mechanics

- I would have loved getting rules with some thematic explanations for the rules!  This makes learning them easier, and also makes games more enjoyable because one is more immersed in the theme.

- You can have multiple copies with the same character name in play ("Ivan Radinsky", etc.).  Moreover, both players can have the same character card fight for him.  I found this thematically strange, at first.  A solution is that this can be thought of as having [i]many people[/i] from this character's [i]clan[/i] working for you; these people do not have to all have the same allegiances.

** The phases

- Combat phase: discarding the fighters (Minions) after the combat (unlike in Magic: the Gathering, for instance) also felt strange, at first: why would they stop working for you?  One possible interpretation is that the cards in play are simply the people one has selected for a single [i]mission[/i].

- Chain phase: adding Minions [i]after combat[/i] felt strange at first (this is different from M:tG).  However, this can be interpreted with the help of the combat phase "mission": after mission, one needs to prepare the next one.  The fact that the other players can add to our chain can be interpreted as them have gathered intelligence about our plans, and reacting to them.

- Claim phase: it's like recruiting new people, or improving one's organization/power.

- Cleanup phase: it's like resting, and considering new options (the hand is later used for preparing missions).

* Comparison with Dominion

- It is nice to be able to play while you are not the main player (via the chain).  Furthermore, the chain mechanism is less fastidious than Dominion's, where one has to count the number of additional actions, etc. that a player can make.

- In Nightfall, I can get the feeling that I lost the game: with 2 players, when you have, say, 13 wounds, you know that there are not much more than 7 wounds to be distributed: it can feel hard to win, and the perspective of keeping playing while you have probably already lost is not nice.  In comparison, Dominion lets you have hopes until quite late in the game: even if your opponent obviously has more high-VP cards than you, you might try to go for the lower-VP ones.

- More interesting buying decisions that in Dominion, I think: you have more flexibility in how much you want to spend.

- The colors dictate which combos can be performed: this adds an interesting constraint.

- The card mechanics in Nightfall are quite thematic.  The card effects are also a little simpler than in Dominion (usually 1 effect, sometimes 2, if kicked).

- The decks tend to be smaller in Nightfall, no?

* Other thoughts

- Character wounds are handled without tokens, which is convenient.

I have the iPad version of this and tried it but even with the tutorial I had no idea what was going on. When I had an opportunity to pick up the analog version for $10 I figured it would help me learn the iPad game. Matt and I played it twice last night and I think we both liked it. I like that it’s a deckbuilder with some actual conflict in it, not just a race to do something before anyone else or create a VP factory. (I don’t have a problem with Thunderstone or Core Worlds, just glad to see this game doing something a little different with the deck-building thing.) I imagine it plays very differently with 2 than with more. I’m now curious about what the expansions add to it.

Turn the stack from Magic into a fully featured, highly interactive game. It also borrows the kicker mechanic from Magic but evolves that as well.

That might seem like two strikes against it but the designer has taken those ideas and elevated them to such a degree that the game is surprisingly unique and plays well.

Much like Dominion or Thunderstone, there is a ton of information to absorb on the front end and will take multiple plays to bring the play time down to a reasonable length. Luckily even initial plays do not feel as long as they actually are. 

Hopefully a few solid expansions will flesh out the system and it will be a contender to the Dominion throne in our group.

Added to my collection in March 2011. First played in March 2011.

I played this first 2 player and was underwhelmed. I have since pleyd it four player and can see that this game gets better with more players as all of the colours will be in use and you probably get to add to more chains between turns.

Ultimately though, this game feels like they sold me 60% of a full game and I'll have to wait until the first expansion comes out to get the full game experience. I think that this is a shame because it will turn many people away from what might be a good game, we just don't know yet. I also think that this isn't a great way to treat your customers.

I think this is the best deck builder to date. Blows the doors off of Thunderstone and Resident Evil, and I don't really like the theme of this game. The most interactive of the deck builders. Affords the most amount of decision making which can be very intricate; purchase a card not just for its affects but how it attacks, defends and especially how it allows for chaining of not just your deck but from other decks. The design and layout of the game is splendid. Lot of little subtleties that make set up, identification, and take down easy. The game plays fluidly and quickly. I'm very impressed with this game. One play was enough to warrant the purchase of the expansions.

Reading the rules for Nightfall had me quite jazzed up due to the promise of a deck-building game that seemed determined to use Dominon as an inspiration instead of a template. While I’d still hold to that view after my first actual play, one of the fresh takes of Nightfall – namely, the victory condition of escaping the fray with the least collected wound cards – leads to a game dynamic that is pretty original, but can veer into unpleasant who-whines-most-wins territory.

This should not pose too much of a problem in a group that has a bit of experience with the game and can correctly gauge who justly deserves some punishment, but it hurts the accessability of a game that was not exactly blessed with it due to the unusual chaining rule. So, not a game you can just plop on the table and expect instant fun. Further plays might decide whether it has the depth to repay these initial difficulties, but at this point, I’m not quite sure what Nightfall has going for it apart from its original (and mostly well implemented) ideas: it’s not really playable with two, clearly depends on further expansions to fully show the potential of the system and is as far removed from its theme as Dominion is.

Didn't like it. The only thing I thought was sort of cool was the chaining mechanic.  It is very tough to judge what a good card is or not, which means you are focusing more on the color moons. Too many rules and exceptions especially with "bad smoke".  Not really the game for me.

I've really wanted to keep this deckbuilder, but after playing it with the Blood Country and Martial Law expansions, there are too many flaws of the game for it to be enjoyable.

There are several balance issues with some of the cards and the entire game revolves nabbing two or three cards.  Once you get these cards, you simply combo through them every single time.

It doesn't matter what type of cards on the table, someone will eventually find a combo and will just use it endlessly. 

Also, the game has a huge kingmaker problem.

Traded it away for Draconis Invasion.

A good addition to the deckbuilding genre that accomplishes what it set out to: more interaction between the players. There's combat between players and the chain mechanic lets you participate during other player's turns. It's important to adapt your strategy to that from the other players.

However, the game is much more difficult to grasp at first. It looks complicated and there's much more going on than in other deckbuilding games. This will give veteran players a significant advantage over new players.

Too long and complex for what it is. I´m not saying it´s very complex, mind you, just too complex for what it is. Players target other players for damage but the running total is hidden. I guess you could say that this isn´t leader-bashing because you may not know who the leader is. It´s more trashtalking and "let´s you and him fight". Played twice, feel no desire to play again. However, I like a couple of concepts here, and I look forward to seeing where deck-building games move from here.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating includes Martial Law expansion.  With just the base game, I would rate it lower.

What I like:
- Wounds as a catch-up mechanism
- Chaining requires planning what cards you want to have in your deck to get effective combos
- Card effects are varied
- Play time is fairly fast (< 45 minutes)
- Drafting for private archives

What I don't like:
- 10 wounds per player doesn't seem like enough time to build and execute your engine, so we add more wounds
- Some cards are pretty powerful when only allowed in private archives, like Leave Me.
- I'm normally not much of a direct conflict person, so I have to be in the right mood to play this.  Also, I feel pretty beat up after a game, so I probably can't play a lot in a short time period.
- I'm not a big fan of politics in games, so I don't enjoy this as much with more than 2 players.  For me, it's just a general dislike of direct conflict with more than 2 players.
- I'm starting to think that a problem with 2 players is that it's more advantageous to chain on the opponent's turn so that you can attack them immediately on your turn.  Of course, this is only if you can chain off of your opponent.

I really ended up liking Nightfall, it's a shame that AEG has bailed on this title...but there are more than enough expansions already out. The chaining and unchaining effect of cards is pretty cool, as well as the overall theme.

After playing with 4 experience players the other night...we realized why the game no longer gets support...it experiences MAJOR slowdowns at times if players are too conservative.

I'm biased towards this game because I love deckbuilders.

Mechanics: 4/5: 
+ Being a deckbuilder with significant player interaction.
+ The way the starter cards are filtered out of your deck. 
+ The chaining system is interesting.
+ Hitpoints represented via card rotation is clever.
+ Combo potential (though as is typical of deckbuilders, by the time you assemble yourself a combo, the game is over)
- The fact that scoring depends on wounds taken severely punishes aggressiveness in 3+ player games. Some variants can alleviate this.

Theme and Gameplay: 4/5
+ Liked the theme. Vampire/Werewolf/Zombie theme is not a negative for me. Small touches like the nicknames for the monsters were amusing.
+ Various effects and combos.
- In general my experience has been that players try to avoid provoking spite in others by spreading out the damage, and win by misleading others as to the number of wounds that they have taken. It rather feels contrary to what an offensive deckbuilder should be, which is to crush your enemies.


Other notes:
Total number of plays with or without various expansions is probably in the 10-15 range. Unfortunately nobody wants to play this with me.

"I just killed your guy. Ha Ha!"

"Yeah, but you still have minion damage to do, so that means you damage yourself."

"Whaa--? Surely I give you wounds...?"

"No, in this case you damage your own minions. It's really quite logical..."

No. It really isn't.

RATING: 6
Draft cards to improve your deck and play cards to hurt your opponent’s decks, to end the game with least wounds.

Plays: More than 100, all on iOS against the AI.
Type: VP engine = a game where you build an engine to collect victory points most efficiently.
Complexity: Medium.
# of players: 3-4.
Playing time: See BGG.
Player interaction: Competition for scarce resources – cards. Conflict. Targeting of other players.
Randomness: Low – card draw, but you decide what cards are in your deck.

Replayability: Low. This gets repetitive pretty quick unless you get some expansions. It also feels a bit too long for what it is. It also has a problem with kingmaking. The way that chains work, the player who starts the last chain of the game will often decide the outcome while not being able to win. Leaves a bad taste.
Fun: The chaining and kicker mechanisms are fun, as they make the game highly interactive. Building combos is also fun. And who doesn’t enjoy some vampire-werewolf action?
Memorability: Low, for some reason the combos aren’t as memorable as in Dominion (the obvious alternative). Maybe because it is easier to get them to go off here? Or because most cards will be in play every game, unlike Dominion?

Thematic integration: Good. The art does a good job communicating the theme, and the wound mechanism makes it feel like you’re in a fight.
Components: The art is great.

Who will like this: Deckbuilding gamers that want a more interactive alternative with direct conflict, like the theme and don’t mind the kingmaking issue.

I learned and played this game at Gencon after purchasing it as an impulse buy. While I love card games... this game I really hate. The mechanics are suppose to be "combo" based, playing off what someone else has played. Each card has a major and 2 minor colors that cause the combos to occur. Everyone has essentially the same deck with multiple copies of cards.

I found that learning the game at Gencon took me a lot longer to learn than I expected (I've played magic the gathering competitively along with just about every mainstream card game). This game is overly complicated and has very little customization/variety compared to most card games. 

Overall... This is my least favorite game I own, I never play this game and never want to

After that, if you like this style of game it is really fun.

Nightfall is deck builder with conflict.  It's a fun game and I look forward to playing the different expansions. The chaining mechanic and attacking other players add something fresh to the genre.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I feel like they came up with the chaining idea used in Nightfall, and just decided that it would work best in a deck builder engine. I think that if it were used in a more fleshed-out way that it could be really interesting, but here it feels a little too restrictive and decisions felt very scripted. I should buy cards that match the moons on the cards in my personal archives rather than based on what the cards themselves do. To me, this made the abilities on the cards fade into the background, and it just became an exercise of trying to play and utilize all of the cards in my hand; something that just about every other deck builder doesn't put restrictions on.

I'm really pleased with Nightfall. I was looking for a deck building game and like Dominion but it's a little too Euro with little player interaction and ultimately competative solitaire like a lot of games.

I like how in Nightfall it's directly antagonistic--everything you do hurts the other players. This makes it more engaging and more fun. Also because your primarily summoning monsters to fight against each other (using chains by the way which is a fun element in itself) it feels a little bit like Magic the Gathering, But I like deck building games more than collectible card games because one--you know what you're getting--and two while there are many expansions, there's not an endless number of expansion packs to buy. Furthermore, cards don't go OUT of Date like they do in MTG. I think living card games also alleviate these issues but they may simply just have too many expansions for my taste--I'll have to try some before I know for sure.

As for Nightfall though, I like the theme. It's a cool underworld sort of world. I like the premise of the sun suddenly stopping and all these monsters showing up but it's a modern tale--again, very Underworld.

People have complained (perhaps rightly so) that they thought this would be werewolves vs humans vs ghouls vs vampires and it's not that. Rather each player gets some of each and sometimes they're copies of the same "individual" who can be named. This latter issue does just take away from the theme a BIT unless you say that this "named" individual represents a certain "class" of werewolf or vampire or whatever--I kind of prefer thinking this way, and you can also alleviate this issue by supposing that you're very modern warlords of a sort and employ in your army different sorts of monsters in a test to control the land--this isn't exactly what's describe in the rich story line that is written in the instruction guide and elaborated on in the various expansions, making for a compelling read, but it still kinds of work.

Furthermore, there is a PERSONAL draft area--forget what it's called. These are cards that only you can draft, you could play a variant--if you wanted where the only draft cards were personal draft cards and each player only had access to a certain race such as ghoul, werewolf, or vampire. THAT WOULD SOLVE THE ISSUES :) YEs BAMM PROBLEM SOLVED BABEEHH!!!!

UPDATE: The game is fun and there's a lot to be had here. I also own EVERYTHING for this game as I'm an obsessive completionist.

That being said, being a deck builder, it has a sizable set up, the actual gameplay and deckbuilding doesn't often seem quite long enough with two players. I sure it's more balanced with 3 but with 3 we are often playing other things. I'm starting to second guess myself here and am wondering how much I even like deck building games. I like how you attack each other in this one but despite cool art and other things, the theme doesn't super duper feel strong on this one even though the motif and atmosphere is there, the mechanics don't necessarily make a huge amount of sense with theme.

Maybe I need a few more plays since I Haven't played it that many times still, but I'm just starting to wonder if I even like the deck building genre that much. I almost always would rather play Netrunenr despite being completely different themes and Netrunner can't be more than two. I don't know. Maybe I need more play throughs.

Seriously, game publishers: Take a look at ALL of the second-generation CCGs that came out of the wake of M:tG.  Maybe three of them were any good.  This deck-building phenom you're swooning over is the same.  Damn.  Pattern playing out.  And to quote the Beatles, "Not a second time."

If Dominion is like a fine wine and Thunderstone is a burger and fries, then Nightfall is raw meat.  Balls out combat with some simple but very important strategy all rolled up in a deckbuilding game.  AEG is making some of the best games around right now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Entirely based on table talk driven kingmaking, so I would not play this with more than three players. With more players, there's also a serious downtime issue.

In addition to kingmaking, the biggest flaw of the game is that the color coding is very hard to decipher even in moderate light conditions.

The chaining is an interesting idea even though the execution is somewhat lacking, and the gameplay in general is pretty light in the decision department. 

Like with the Thunderstone expansion, I really appreciate how AEG makes the game boxes truly suitable for storing sleeved cards by providing a functional insert, proper dividers, and even foam stuffing for the empty space.

Easily one of the worst games I have ever played.

I fear this may be the last deck-builder I will ever play due to the poor experiences I have had with every single one I have played. Farewell, shitty deck-builders! On to much better games!

In this game the creatures of the night will be coming more powerful in the world...vampires, werewolves and ghouls.
A deck building game with some fun and interesting mechanics. I need to play this one more to go into the finer details.
But I will say that players will have their own unique set of cards to pull from as well as cards to shop for in the center of the table.

The unique system of chaining the moon symbols on the cards allows players to connect their cards together to make some powerful plays.
But at the same time your opponents are also allowed to chain off from your chain.

You will be trying to put Wound cards into your opponents deck through battles. The player with the least wounds will win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The player who gets attacked the least wins? And the players can choose who to attack freely? No thanks.

There is a huge memory element in that to play well it is essential to memorise how many wounds each player has sustained (NB. player with fewest wounds wins). It is also important to remember which cards opponents (and you) have purchased. 

Nightfall is best described as 'like Dominion but not as good', and it takes twice as long to play.

Blugh!

This game really brought some new stuff to the table.  This has far more direct conflict than dominion/thunderstone/etc, which is clear since you are literally fighting opponents.  The battle mechanism has a mtg feel to it, though all your minions last only on a turn by turn basis.  The chaining is what peaked my interest, but it is not the first or second best thing this game brings to the table (though it is good).  The starting deck is comprised of all cards that destroy themselves when used, very cool!  Also, each player has private archives (kingdom/village cards) that only they can access.  What this does is allow both players to pursue unique strategies and not waste time to thin the original starting deck cards.  Really looking forward to playing this more.

edit: Got to play it a few more times over the last year or so and it just is not that good.  The theme is a real detractor for me, and the progression of games seems to clunky to me.  Not completely this games fault, but after playing puzzle strike (which is on a whole different level than other deckbuilders) I really cannot see this getting to the table ever again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Dress it up in Dominion clothes all you like, add a fancy new chaining mechanism to allow all players to play cards on each player's turn, but this is nought but a multi-player hit-the-leader whack-fest, the winner being who's picked on least. Or in an evenly whacked game, who was lucky enough to avoid being noticed in the musical chairs being allocated in the final turns. Or lucky enough to play with players who aren't paying attention (ie keeping count) on who's been allocated the most wounds - if you win. Unlucky if in the same circumstance you get picked on unrightly. The nature of which complete overwhelms any cleverness you might be able to achieve with your deck construction, begging the question what's the point, except for the exercise of playing whack-fests with your friends while pretending that the decisions you make with your deck matter. If you can hold that pretence, at least the kinds of deck-building and playing decisions are interesting as far as they go, with lots of choice on what to build and when to play.

Based on one play: Another deck building game, but these mechanics are much less straightforward then the more well known games in the genre. It took a while to get all the small details cleared up, but even then, the game does not play smoothly and although the artwork is nice, there are better games in the genre.

A pretty neat deck builder that brought some fun elements into it that I haven't seen in other DBs. I like the drafting for your private archive, and the chaining is really unique and fun to play around with.

RATING: 6
This is an interesting take on a deck-building game.  In addition to common cards to purchase, the game has individual purchase cards that are drafted before the game starts.  Hand management played an important role, to make sure that you had creatures available to block at the right times.  And the "chaining" mechanic was pretty neat, as it gave increased incentive to pay attention to not only how you construct your own deck, but also to how your opponents construct theirs.  However, what I didn't like about this game was that it forces players to "police" the table: you *must* gang up on the leader in this game, and figuring out who the leader is is an exercise in remembering how many wound cards each player has received.  Additionally, I felt that the game ended before I was really able to make the most of my card combinations.

RATING: 4.5
I love the theme, the characters, and the direct attacking actions to do to others.  The combos and buying of cards is good, too.

What fell flat with me was the following:

1) The play areas in front of players require mats to be created to remember which pile does what.  It's VERY messy.

2) The chaining/comboing is also very messy and doesn't make sense.  Often people will forget whose turn it is and which card you're chaining from.  A player button, again to be created, is mandatory as well.  Without it, the game play is again VERY messy.  Even with a button, the chaining off people back and forth, whoever is still in or out, is very messy.

3)  Its combos make no thematic sense, especially off others.  You just match colors.

4) It feels whoever flies under the radar will win.  Whoever is in the lead will get the attacks against them.  Then repeat around the board for the new leader.  This is the biggest issue for me--the best player is easily pounded while the quiet will win.

5) The types of wounds is random, yet breaks ties.  I don't understand why these can't be assigned from certain types of attacks.

If a friend HAD to play it, I would, however would never choose or want to play it.

Yes! I bought a bunch of cards that will not only chain into each other, but will activate their unique kicker bonuses! My deck is set up, and I'm ready for some cool stuff. Hey, wait... you just bought 5 copies each of two cards that chain into each other? You just hit me for 8 damage? The game is over? Oh...

11/21/12 - I traded the Rex Dune remake for Nightfall and Ascension. Ascension was a bust but Nightfall was a pleasant surprise. The chaining mechanic is really cool and being able to chain on your opponents turns really helps with downtime. There's tons of interactions and I think the game will only get better with the expansions I'm planning to buy. Good game (Rating: 8.5)

12/11/12 - I ended up purchasing Coldest War, Blood Country and traded for Martial Law. I plan to play Epic Nightfall but I am worried about the difficulty creep. I'm also worried about balance with all the cards mixed together. I still really like the game though. (Rating:8.5)

I own the IOS version of the game. Since it was on sale for $1 I figured I might as well give the game a try. First impression about the game is that it tries to do too much as a deck builder. Being spoiled by Dominion, I just felt the mechanics is a blend between Dominion and Magic the Gathering. I would rather play MtG if I want a monster battle game, and if I want to do a light-euro deck builder exercise, I would play Dominion. Oh and the fact that I am so-so with Vampire theme might have made the rating lower. It has just a tiny more theme than Dominion but since I don't care for it, the game didn't click with me.

Draft cards, buy cards, try to win deckbuilder.

My love of the game is fueled by the interaction/chaining mechanism of the cards; all players get a chance every action to play cards, as long as they follow the color rules of the cards.  Wounds (the lose condition) can actually fuel your hand to get more cards and be more dangerous.
However, for any given draft, there seem to often be only one or two good synergies to go for, making one deck run into another and become less unique, but for the occasion spot of color of a player's personal supply -- further complicated by if one player has good synergy with their supply, they almost certainly have a heavy edge.

I thought it was great and it definitely had something new and different to add to the "Deckbuilding" genre.  However, I would caution the average Dominion fan that this game seems significantly more complex for the first few plays.

The rules were difficult to grasp at first but after several plays made complete sense.  As with most card games with rule breaking effects on individual cards, the complexity is in trying to tie cards together for good combos.

I got to admit.  I only played this once.  I have to admit.  It felt more thematic than Dominion.  I have to admit.  There is a steeper learning curve on the nuance of this game when compared to Dominion.  I have to admit.  It might be better than Dominion.  

However, it is another deck-building game.  The theme seems REALLY pasted on.  The color schemes seem to have little to do with the reasons for the content of each card.

So for now it is lowly rated.  Sorry.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Please don't make me play this again.  Over two hours of torture.

The basic premise seems fine - borrow heavily from Dominion, but make it so that every player can join in a chain of action cards - instead of watching "village, village, smithy, village, smithy" ad naseam, you get to join in - but with every player subject to the limitation that they can only add cards to the stack if they started the turn with them.  Plus the goal is highly interactive - like the old V:TES card game, you're trying to pile damage onto your opponents but have to go through their creatures first a lot of the time.  Sounds great.

But the interaction is also the game's big flaw.  There's little point planning my turn ahead of time, as it's going to be a completely different game state by the time we get there.  And the way that actions chain means that I can't even plan what I'm going to play until the player immediately before me has played onto the action stack - because what he plays determines which of my cards are legal to play.  So I can only start thinking when he's finished thinking and played his cards.

And all this can happen on every play's turn.  In a five-player game, I'd be thinking "it must be my turn again soon" only to discover that we'd not even finished the very next player's go, let alone got anything like the whole way around the table.  So the interaction manages to *increase* downtime - counterintuitively.  

All in all, this is not an experience I want to repeat, and reminds me of the early days of CCGs.  Magic was a hit, but it was also a good game.  Almost everything that followed in the same vein was rubbish - often the closest imitators being amongst the worst.  Same here - Dominion is a great game, but copying the basics and then "tweaking" it for greater interaction is not actually a good recipe.  In fact, it turned out to be a pretty bad one IMO.    

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another game in the recent rash of deckbuilding mechanics.  The card drafting is a good solution, and the card chaining is an innovative way to get cards out on the table into play.  Combat is very reminiscent of Magic:TG.  Still, it's  another game that will require memorizing the text and benefits of many cards, and it's up to you if you are interested in more of that in a horror themed deckbuilder.

On my first play of this I wanted to throw it outside and light it on fire. Additional plays revealed a nuanced, still annoying deck building game. It could do with better card stock, greater card variety and more wound abilities (all things the undoubtedly twenty expansions will "fix") it is a halfway decent game I guess, but I can't stand it. It's not good enough to stand above Dominion, Ascension, or even the similarly bad Rune Age. I don't care for the theme either, it's... strange.

This is very different to all the other deck building games, and as such takes a bit of getting used to.  I've actually traded the original set away once --- then bought it again along with the Martial Law expansion.  I like the game, but still have a pretty up-and-down take on it :)

A year on, not so enamoured with this.  Not keen on the constant flood of expansions which clog up the game with additional rules.  It's possible that [i]Core Worlds[/i] may become my favourite 'deck-builder', but I'll still have a soft spot for this one.

EDIT:  Played this a few times recently and remembered why I enjoy it.  I think [i]Ascension[/i] and [i]Core Worlds[/i] (including [i]Galactic Orders[/i]) are better games, but I think it's fair to say that I really do love this game.

RATING: 7
Such a unique game. I'm not often a fan of deck-builder games, but the chain/kicker mechanics of Nightfall are a nice twist on the genre. It can be hard to balance your decisions within all of the chaos. It really comes down to a game of colors, counting the moon symbols that your opponents collect and claiming what works with THEIR deck. I also like how the winner is the player with the least wounds, meaning players can't afford to get into petty grudge matches. You gotta spread the love in Nightfall.

This game is nearly perfect. I love that all players are engaged on all turns; I love that every card can be used for something on every one of your turns; I love the way the cards play off each other and how this increases as expansions come out. My only real complaint is that the starter cards all break the norms of the other cards in the game, which increases the learning curve for new players.

Nightfall is a deck building game. This means it works a lot like a Collectible Card Game (you have to spot interesting interactions with cards, balance probabilities, and someone keeps trying to sell you more stuff). Unlike a CCG everyone uses the same pool of cards and you get all of them when you first buy the game.
To start play everyone gets an identical starter deck of ten cards. Then in each round you attack the other players, use any cards from your hand you wish to use, buy new cards from the common pool and put them into the deck, and then draw back up.
All of this is very simple, once you get your head around the 'chain' mechanic and that everyone can cast spells (no they don't call it that - its supposed to be about Vampires) on everyone elses turn. However, the game has some real depth to it within these simple mechanics. When collecting cards you need to think about not only which are most useful, but also how much opportunity you will get to cast them, and this depends on how other people are building their decks as well as how you are building yours.
The game works well both two player and multiplayer, though it is fairly easy to be knocked out of contention in a multiplayer game and there could be a strong kingmaker element as a result. Having said that the game has no 'positional' play and therefore you always compete on equal terms with the others - and for a lot of players the kingmaking won't be obvious.

And an aside: One of the odd things is the way people misunderstand the importance of the mechanics. A lot is talked about the chaining mechanic, which could easily have been replaced and the game would work just as well. It is the 'one use' of your creatures (after they attack they go away) that gives the game its rhythm and is most important to its success. It prevents exactly the stalemate situations or overwhelming positional plays that afflict multi-player magic.

I bought this game way back in 2011 (one of my very first game purchases - I think my first of a "new" game), but have not played it since the first few tryout plays because my wife absolutely detested it. I am still not really sure why, but it seems pointless trying to argue for more plays - especially as my taste in games has now changed quite a lot and this is no longer a game I feel that disappointed not to be playing. Having said that, I think it looks like a good game (and I suspect it gets much better with expansions, as most card games do), so I rate it as a 7 - but I'll never get to test this rating again, because I somewhat reluctantly agreed to put it on our list of games to sell. It had not been played in nearly 4 years, and my wife declared no interest in changing this. I hope its new owner is enjoying it :)

04-10-2014. Rated after 2 plays. Interesting deck-builder in which you try to link ('chain') cards in order to play multiple each turn. Chaining is done by color, and each card allows just several other colors played after it. Aim of the game is to quickly ensure your opponent has most wound cards in their deck. You can chain minions or 'action cards', and at the start of your turn your previously chained minions basically attack, your opponent gets to block them MtG style, and your cards subsequently get discarded. 

I like the game, but it does not really feel thematic, which I expected. Currently it feels like a complicated AP puzzle, more plays may alleviate this problem. Given that pure deck-builders are a type of game that is past its hayday and I like Thunderstone Advance better, I am not sure if I'd give Nightfall more chances to convince me of its merits.

A little disappointing - I was hoping for CCG mecahnics - direct player confrontation, interesting synergies.

The random selectional of cards cuts down the chaining mechanic. The kicker means some combinations become artificially better - even though they don't actually synergize well, and the lack of variety means that you always end up with the same kicker/kickee combo.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Only one play so my opinion may not be fair but I found nothing to like.  The chaining is a neat idea but very hard to puzzle out.  It is a pure bash the leader with a publicly hidden but track-able leader.  The forced attack is a good idea but compounds the bash the leader as there isn't much of a defensive strategy.  Maybe it works 2 player but 4 player nothing you do is going to matter the other players are going to hit you and nothing you do is going to be enough.

This card game feels like [i]Magic: The Gathering[/i], because you try to hit other players using different card effects, and because you use creatures played in front of you as shields and in the same time as weapons, but it also adds two new mechanics: The chained reaction of the cards (which allows to play multiple cards in a row according to their label and the labels they match, even in the other players' turns) and, of course, the deckbuilding aspect. The fact that the chains are resolved backwards gives also a nice and strategic flavour to the game. The setup is the best that I've tried on a game of this kind and gives the players some decisions to make, not depending all on luck. [i]Nightfall[/i] feels something different in the genre, in a good way, taking a distance from [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=380&Itemid=1]Dominion[/url][/i], [i]Resident Evil[/i] and [i]Thunderstone[/i], which are more similar between them.

Deck-building with fangs (sorry).  With turn/play prediction and controlling access to play it's as deep as you want it to be and more rewarding the farther the rabbit hole you go. Love that you are busy playing the game on everyone's turn with very little down time unlike other beloved deck-builders. Every game I play, strategy evolves and once-thought-dull cards find more interesting uses.  Casual gamers love the art and theme, but it's really for slightly advanced players as the number of things you have to do on your turn can be overwhelming to noobs. Only sticky point is the 'screw' nature of the combat system - it's fair as it mimics the idea of brutal combat perfectly, but I'm always the one teaching it so I'm the one always getting ganged up on.

An interesting (and good) game that has a bit of a learning curve.  Am hopeful that more plays with skilled opponents will help make the game smoother. Wish they had used icons along with colours of the moons for chaining and kickers.  Am hopeful that more varied wound types will add to the game play.

CAVEAT:  Have only ever played 2-p; definitely want to play with more players at once.  Rating could change!

Finally got to play this after winning a sweet lot of virtually everything.  Combat is quick, the chain mechanic is sweet and fun, and there are so many combos of cards that you can play forever before playing with the same cards twice.  Excellent, underappreciated game.

The idea of it is interesting, but it doesn't quite work. The interesting part is that it is a good attempt at mixing MtG with deck building. For me chains are neat idea and as I find the game as thematic as MtG (not a lot, but don't mind). There are also other neat ideas like personal archives and automatic destruction of starting deck cards. Problem is the game ends too soon, just as you start doing something with the deck it's already over. Haven't experience multiplayer situation where I can understand a lot can be about just luck (who to attack when in lack of real incentives for negotiation). 

Experienced the multiplayer situation, unfortunately the loud guy explaining the game made a big point out of the need to attack the least defended players causing a rich get richer syndrome - negotiations are necessary! Will see if this gets some repeated plays. As for the game, I don't know - combos are fairly easy to see, but takes time to implement and you're still with a small deck when it all ends. Playing with a different groupthink might see me up the rating.

When I received it as a Christmas present in 2011, I could not wait to play and I was not disappointed. 
Now, I already own the 2 basic games and the expansion Blood Country and Martial Law. 

If you play with all expansions and the basic games David Gregg had some nice advice how to avoid double moons. However, it is also good if you watch how many action cards are in play. Lately we had too many of them so that it was nearly impossible to destroy one another. ^_^' 

Gonna buy the other expansion as well. Being curious what comes next =D

DBG. This has some good things going for it. I like the overall system and the way wounds are dealt -- it encourages attack the leader rather than beat on the weakling in a multiplayer conflict game. The chaining mechanic is very interesting as well, but in my limited play experience (a few face to face games, a few online games, several games vs AI), I feel like the chaining system actually limits your deck building options rather than making them more interesting.

People say in Dominion that you look at the tableau and formulate your strategy at the start. In Nightfall, it seems like it's almost impossible to deviate from your strategy because you'll ruin your chain chances if you do.

UPDATE: Gets better with some of the later expansions. First two expansions don't really add much strategy, just more of the same... but this game starts to shine more with the new ideas introduced in Coldest War and Eastern Skies.

[hr]

Don't like this game. The "deck-building" is weird, matching colors instead of synergy between abilities. And the victory condition is problematic -- one swingy turn can spell the death of you, no way to even sort of defend yourself against multiple players attacking you in FFA, and you can be out of the running halfway through the game easily.

There are some cool ideas here -- private archives, chaining off your opponent's plays, etc. The color chaining in particular seems like a double-edged sword, though -- while it's cool way to force you to take your opponents buys into account, and its cool to get to do stuff on someone else's turn (just a cool idea all around) the fun with combos in these card games is to discover cards that have their own synergy with each other. This game forces synergies with cards that may very well not go together other than the fact that they chain off of each other.

Another thing I like is the fact that you do not have to discard any of your cards at the end of the turn, and can instead choose to save or keep cards to line up with your next draw. Great idea to reduce the luck factor present in most deck builders that didn't evolve the "Clean Up" phase past Dominion.

But it just doesn't seem as strategic as it should be, and not fun enough to make me want to find out for sure. Just seems sloppily designed overall, which I'm sorry about, because this came highly recommended!

It's possible that it's fun at an expert level, but if that's the case then there just isn't a healthy learning curve, cause all anyone I play with sees is color matching and very light tactical decisions (and in multiplayer, one-sided, uninteresting politics)

Tag-team-duo of Puzzle Strike and Rune Age mop the floor with this one. Puzzle Strike if you want a competitive deck builder, Rune Age if you want a thematic/flavorful one based on combat.

Wow, this is just terrible. The ideas in here are really cool, like the private cards that only you can buy and the cool color-coded chainage. But the reality is that the gameplay falls flat, as I get some guys out there and they kill off most of your guys but don't do damage and then my opponent does the same, and we go back and forth until finally someone has the momentum and gets the win. The theme also is unappealing for me, and I'll give it another shot with three someday just to see if the dynamic is a little more interesting.

This game far exceeded my expectations. Players will remain engaged throughout the game as they may add to the active player's played chain of cards. Card art was a huge let down but surprisingly (because aesthetics matter to me) this didn't get in the way of my enjoyment of the game.

I'm a big fan of card games with a lot of player interaction.  I played Magic: The Gathering competitively for many years until the monetary and time commitment just became too overwhelming.  So whenever I find a cheap replica in the world of board gaming I'm usually on board.

The majority of Nightfall is just another battle card game.  You play creatures and spells and try to do more damage to your opponent than he does to you with his creatures and spells.  The unique thing about this game is the casting mechanic.  Each card has a color as well as one or two linking colors.  You can play as many cards from your hand in a turn as you can link together...and then your opponents get to add to the end of your link and the creatures/spells resolve in FILO order.  This unique play order encourages a new way of thinking as your opponents plays actually get the jump on yours during your own turn.  There's a lot of other strategic nuance as well like kicker effects, private and public card pools, wound effects, etc. so I consider this a well-designed card game with a fresh feel.

Suffers from the same need for expansions as most other deckbuilding games I've played and the theme isn't really for me.

I am mystified by the high ratings this game receives. I have played it twice, and both times were painful. Absolutely defies description. Shallow gameplay, a pasted on theme, and an attempt to cache in on the Vampire craze with no redeeming qualities... well.. the art work isn't bad. Beyond that, it's a real stinker. Also takes entirely -too- long to play. I'm told the expansions much improve this, but I don't care to find out.

I was so eager to play this greatly themed deck-builder with the so positively mentioned chain mechanism, now I did and I am underwhelmed. The chain makes it more interactive, when it's your turn you start the chain, it goes around the table and interrupts your turn, when it comes back to you you finish your turn. At the start of the next turn when you have cards out you attack, the goal is to have the least wounds of all by the end of the game. 
So far, I am not a fan of the chain, yes, it makes the game more interactive than other DBs but it takes away some of the stream line that most DBs have, I miss that straight forward game play. I guess, this is the DB for people who mind the slightly solitary aspect of usual DBs, for me this one turned a nudge too chaotic.
 I, too, wish the theme would have a stronger impact, Resident Evil DB does that better (well it is my fave DB, so figure), it is just DB fighting but the apocalypse is thematically not present, do the colors of the moons have anything to do with the cards? Seemed random to me, plus, the cards were really unbalanced at first glance, some I really don't see my self wanting. Took a while to get into actually having a deck and then the ending comes very rushed.
Given, I need a few more plays I think, but for now I am only okay with it, not enthralled.

RATING: 4
Some very interesting ideas there to make Dominion more interactive (attacking, chaining) but lacks the obvious polish/elegance. Like Thunderstone et al, a lot of promise but just doesn't cut the mustard.

The chain system is interesting but potentially frustrating; pulling off very long combos is impossible but it is important to collect cards which can often be chained, and (critically) added to opponents' chains. It's far more interactive and there is much more to consider -- you can play Dominion on autopilot; Nightfall is a little more taxing.

There are a bunch of problems, though. The increased variation in the starting decks increases the level of variation over what you would see in Dominion, and hence the level of randomness. The focus on chaining also makes it less likely that players will focus on key engine cards, which increases the chance of a situationally dud hand -- you want something to damage creatures and you can only damage players.

The worst part of the game is the wound system. As a game timer it seems too short; damage is far easier to deal than to block and it is possible to deal an unrecoverable amount of damage in a single turn quite early in the game.

In multiplayer games it also inclines players to pick on the perceived leader -- this is a problem in multiplayer Magic, too, hence variants like two-headed giant, "attack left" etc. For that reason I much prefer it with two players only (rating: 4.5). The reason the rating doesn't improve more is that the luck-factor is far more keenly felt with two. The total number of wounds available is sufficiently small that a good hand played against a bad one can easily cause 10+ wounds at once. It is very difficult for a single hand in Dominion to ever have that much impact.

It's an OK game, and like most deckbuilders I assume it will improve with expansions, but it's hard to justify playing over the competition.

Great theme play, although the theme does not interest me much.  Fairly easy to learn and play, will take a couple of plays to get the hang of things.  Some new mechanics, like chaining and 'sideboards', for a deck building game (DBG) but ultimately still suffers many of the same problems as other DBG.  Player interaction is very high, which is also different than most DBGs.  Suffers a kingmaking problem when playing with three players.  Components very good - thick cardboard chits and fairly durable cards with very good artwork.  Well written color rulebook.  Game length is short with two players, but still OK with more players.

Meh. Didn't click for me as a deck building card game. The attacking specific players makes it a very "political" game and can result in one person giving the game to another.

My favorite interactive deckbuilder. Highly recommend getting Marshal Law to go with it as additional cards increase replay exponentially. 
Worth mentioning: The strategy of holding on to starters to cap chains is not obvious. This is why people may play a couple times and get frustrated when they are blown out by opposing chains. Tossing the first few opening hands for influence works well.

An interesting blend of deckbuilding mechanics and CCG-style combat. Unfortunately the deckbuilding mechanics are very much overwhelmed by the CCG-style play, so for me Nightfall really competes more with Netrunner and Summoner Wars rather than with Dominion. 

Like most CCGs, it devolves to the worst kind of politics and whining in multiplayer, and for a two player game, you really do have better gameplay options with actual CCGs and/or fixed deck games. 

Overall, Nightfall isn't as good a deckbuilder as Dominion, and it isn't as good a combat card game as L5R, A:NR, SW (the list goes on), so for me it slips through the cracks. But maybe Nightfall is for you if you have been specifically looking for a hybrid of these games.

First opinion wasn't good. Revising based on some more two player plays, which lose the strong king-maker and whine elements. Enjoying it more with more plays. Chains still feel a bit awkward; the game is more about setting up good chains than looking for more 'organic' combos.

One of the more complex deck building games, and it comes with attacking other people too! You build your deck with vampires and spells that try to deal wounds to other people, but your creatures need to stay on the table for a whole round before they get to attack...

I was looking for a deck building game for my collection.  What drew me to Nightfall was that this game is just more than a deck building game.  It is also about summoning minions to attack your opponents as well as casting spells.  It is also very interactive compared to other deck building games I have played.  You get to react to being attacked and you even get to play your cards when it is not on your turn.  Other deck building games I have played seemed a little like solitaire in a group sometimes.  With Nightfall, you are always interacting and reacting to your opponents.

Positives: One of the first (at least mainstream) deckbuilders to embrace direct confrontation/combat between players. It also implemented a clever system for playing cards on other player's turns by chaining off of their played cards. 

Negatives: The general theme is hit-or-miss (a battle among Vampires, Werewolves, Ghouls, and Humans), but ultimately it is pretty thin here (e.g. I can play the same character card that you just played, which ccoouulldd make sense if the character units weren't uniquely named individuals). Another negative is that the game can feel a bit math-y and "mechanical," further abstracting it from the theme.

At the end of the day, Nightfall makes for an interesting deckbuilder that paved the way for later deckbuilders that built on some of the innovations found here. Furthermore, I recommend hunting down the various expansions for the game as they add new mechanics that really flesh out the game and make it a more interesting affair. 

Sidenote: for those who do not usually sleeve your games, you are more than likely going to want to sleeve the cards here. The cardstock is a bit lackluster.

First play introduced a single glaring issue for me and my group: Gameplay didn't affect the outcome at all...only begging and pleading did.

I understand this social aspect was designed to be there, but it seems like it has overpowered the game mechanics.

I see huge potential in this game, however.  And just because it's wasn't a perfect 10 for me and my group doesn't mean it can't be for someone else.  The mechanics of this game are great (albeit busy: so many colors everywhere!).  I think with a little house ruling, we can fix this game up to work better for us!

Update 9/30: I have not played since, but have a thought on what is needed - personal goals and hidden points.  This would give people purpose and a way to earn points in the game, which is what I think the game needs.

As for right now, I'm very much enjoying this game.  I like the chain mechanism and trying to buy cards not necessarily for the powers, but for the effect that they have upon what you can play makes for a different type of deck building game.

A really good deck building game. Thematically it seems to be a little bit of a mess, with all units and actions being available to all players really confusing any sense of over arching story or purpose. Also, the gameplay itself can be hard to get your head around and simple tactical decisions can dominate the game making patterns of play very repetitive. Still, overall I find it to be enjoyable but only really with 2 players (more drags the playtime out almost indefinitely).

As a two-player game, Nightfall reminds me of a lighter, deck-building, version of Magic. The head-to-head combat is a welcome change from other deck-builders that have always seemed like multi-player solitaire to me. The chaining mechanic is also fun, especially when you can build an effective chain (with kickers) off of your opponent's cards. Two-player Nightfall is a quick, punchy game that can be enjoyed for a few games in a row.

With three or more players, Nightfall is less interesting. Actually, I'd say that I would avoid multi-player Nightfall. The game lasts a bit too long, and card combinations become repetitive. In addition, the meta-game question of who to attack and when overshadows card play, which amounts to a frustrating dose of kingmaking.

Nightfall brings a clever twist to the deck-building genre:  color-chaining.  A diverse sampling of cards is required to maintain a color sequence that actually releases them to the table.  If one specializes too much, that carefully built deck will stay locked out of play.  But that said, Nightfall has a fussy turn order that is ultimately disengaging.

Preliminary rating after one game. It's hard to catch on to the the atmosphere in the first game as you mostly just see or pay attention to the moons, link moons and the kickers. Asyou can react to the chains of your coplayers, the clue in this deckbuilding game is that you optimize it according to how your opponents build theirs. Also, the private archives give a nice twist. However, the game didn't grab me right away. Maybe with more experience, the theme (nice background story btw) of the game will go strong

After one play, a three-player game, this seemed quite chaotic. Did not seem to flow well, a bit prone to AP as card combos and chaining were calculated. Success/results seemed somewhat arbitrary depending on who got attacked, rather than how skillfully the deck was made. Dominion is still the king IMO.

Finally got a play of Nightfall in; it was worth the wait.  Interesting mechanics, a good theme, and fun gameplay all elevated this game above the crowd.

The chain mechanic was definitely a little tricky, but once people got used to it they were flying everywhere.

A great multi-player game to be sure; not sure how it would fare as a 2 player offering... the game owners' said they didn't care for it with 2 only.

Can't wait to play this again.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/88408/nightfall]Nightfall[/url] isn't a bad game, it is just a game that allows one player to get upset, enter into a dog-card-fight with other and the third player will win handly.

In the game, there might be one turn, just one, where you couldn't put enough cards in the table. All your game could be lost in here. One attack and all is done. This will not always ne true, but I seen it happen more than once.

Players get mad to receive an attack, and then reply by attacking. However, the one being attacked might not even the the player ahead. This reminds me of [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/40692/small-world]Small World[/url] - you can try to reason with the person, but usually things will come out as "just trying to hide the *fact* that you are winning", only that you aren't.

The chain of cards is a novelty and I liked quite a bit. Should have a finner game around it.

The game has some clever mechanics for sure, but the problem with this game is that the actual gameplay is mostly irrelevant to the outcome of the game. It doesn't matter who builds the best deck or who pulls off the meanest combos. The only thing that matters is who people gang up on the most.

In the end the game is decided by who manages to convince everyone else that they are the lowest threat. Having a good or bad deck doesn't seem to affect much of anything.

Also, the theme is incredibly poorly done with bad art and no connections between flavour and function at all.

Thunderstone, it is not (despite all the players in my group making the comparison), and that's a good thing. I really like Thunderstone, but it is nice to have a deck-building game like this, that plays so differently. 

The one issue I noticed with my group is that people aren't so comfortable with attacking other people. That's what happens when you play a lot of cooperative and "friendly", non-confrontational Euros, I suppose. This will only be an issue with certain groups, of course. We will just have to toughen up. :)

The chaining mechanic is brilliant.  You really stayed involved at all times.  I suggest that if you're playing with four people, use teams and pool together wounds at end. "Opponent" references on cards don't apply to teamates.

Great great game. Feels like Dominion meets Magic the Gathering, but very original in spite of that reference.

The theme is cool.  I would love to see some vampire hunters added to it! :)

Was not happy with this game, even after trying very hard to give it a shot.  I think the combat and chaining work well in a deck building game, but here is my number one issue... the game play didn't feel like the theme.  There was no biting (other than some wound cards) and no blood sucking... it could have been Care Bears vs Strawberry Shortcake and the cards would have worked the same.  I felt left wanting more, and even with playing with the expansion (Martial Law) I feel as though I can't recommend this game, unless you are a staunch vampire/werewolf fan.  I am, and it still was disappointing.

RATING: 8.5
A very solid investment. If you are looking for a deckbuilding game that feels different than the tired Ascension or Dominion games, then give Nightfall a try. Refreshing gameplay revolves around all players getting a chance to "chain" their cards off the current player's turn for truly chaotic and more direct player-to-player interaction. Can't recommend it enough.

Probably the best deck-building game I've played so far, but I can't say I'm big fan of the mechanic. Room for some real strategy and at least there's ferocious player interaction (for a change.)

Direct PvP makes this very different from most deck-building games- the chief criticism of many being their lack of player interaction. Private archives and a drafting mechanic also set this apart from other DBG's.

Since the player with the fewest wounds wins, the game suffers from "Munchkin Syndrome," wherein players often try to minimize their apparent threat to the rest of the table.

If your opponents do not make an effort to remember where everyone stands, this can lead to runaway victories. Similarly, players that have a knee-jerk response to receiving wounds by playing recklessly (vengeance) ruin any semblance of balance. 

If you receive a lot of wounds, it is possible to be mathematically incapable of winning, but in typical Munchkin fashion, you can throw the game in someone's favor. This aspect of the game is something I find very unappealing.

Nightfall is a nifty little game.  I really enjoyed Dominion and this is the first new DBG I've played.  It actually feels like quite a different game from Dominion given it's core mechanism.  I was pleasantly surprised that it felt so different.  The chaining mechanism is very clever.  I like the interaction between he players.  The rules were put together nicely, we were able to figure it out after a single read through.  Overall, it is fun, and one you can't play once.  You'll likely fall into the "one more time" trap, which speaks well of the game :)

Dominion has begat a lot of games that use the deck-building mechanism, and luckily each successive game has added a little something to the idea to expand on the idea and make more of a game out of the basic premise.  Nightfall is one of the latest entry into the field, and I like the variety of choices it allows the players to make with the chaining mechanism and the victory condition.  It mixes up players' expectations for a deck-building game, and it definitely takes a game to understand how the mechanisms work in the game, but the problem is that the game just isn't very engaging.  It's innovative and interesting, and I wouldn't necessarily turn down a game of it, but I'm not going to be playing it at every game night, either.  It's just a solid middle-of-the-road game for me.

Utterly broken with 3 or more players. Winner is random unless one or more player is stoned out of his head, in which case it becomes random between the remaining players. 

Since the designers incomprehensibly failed to notice, there's no reason to think the 2p version deserves anyone's time.

One of the rare broken games which is so horribly bad (and overrated) that it makes me deeply suspicious of both the publisher's and designer's other games.

It's probably due to the fact that i don't like this kind of games, but also Nightfall doesn't seem fun at all to me (remember that i love Dominion anyways).
I never felt involved in the game, mechianics aren't simple. It is not linear to remember which card to keep, which to discard, which to exile, I always had to ask what to do after using a certain cart.
The chain mechanics could be interesting and original but in the end the game is pretty boring. Luckily, it didn't last long.

RATING: 5.5
Tentative rating that could decrease over time.  Or open-mindedness will prevail and a mighty "6" will leap forth.

Much of the game is driven by opportunity: the starting cards in your hand, the chain options provided by the previous player, and - importantly - the chance to hammer the perceived winner.  Though any undefended player will do if everyone is well-screened by minions.

To play well, you have to spend a nontrivial amount of time reading every card in the card chains, or suffer the result.  If you were a Nightfall fiend, you'd have every card memorized and it wouldn't be a problem.  In my case, I'll never be intimately familiar with the cards because there are too many non-deckbuilding games (like, all of them) that I'd rather play instead.

If I were less tolerant I might say that I'd rather stroke out than play another deckbuilding game.  Although Nightfall [i]is[/i] more likely to get played given its staunch support of player interaction and horror-isms.  Just don't ever let a game of Nightfall last more than 30 minutes, or I'm outta here.

OK, you caught me.  I'm not really that tolerant.

I'm quite a fan of the Dominion series and therefor was interested into giving this game a try. And I came to the conclusion that I quite dislike the color chaining mechanic that is the core of this game.
I understand the merit about more player interaction and that people prefer this game's ideas over those available in a game like Dominion, but I have not problem with the player interaction-less games out there.

I also found this game to be significant less fun than Star Realms, which causes me to give this game a 5.

RATING: 6.5
A more confrontational deck builder. The chain system is pretty cool and direct conflict is a nice change. Still not sure what the best moves are during the game. Needs more plays.

With more plays I'm starting to see that just throwing out your entire hand for a huge chain isn't the optimal way to play. There are obvious reaction cards and times where playing a card will just accomplish nothing (e.g. minion damage with no minions out). Sometimes it seems worth playing a cheap minion just to attack later and get it out of the deck but you could also discard it for influence instead of wasting the move.

We also noticed that we were kind of screwing up the card distribution inadvertently by choosing not to reuse cards from the prior setup. This constantly led to a shortage of colors in the later games.

Had a crazy long 3-player game. None of us are really that familiar with the game so that might have been the cause but I'm still a little wary about playing more 3p. On the plus side, 2p worked great.

Pretty poorly thought-out game. Because the attacking is so direct and the objective is to get hurt the least, it is extremely political and "gang-up-on-the-leadery" to the point that you can't really gain an advantage early on unless your opponents aren't paying attention.

Meanwhile, half the cards are mostly useless in a two-player game, in which the strategy is just to clear out your starter minions from your deck and get as many Rend and Tear, Death Grip, Ivan Radinsky and Franz Orlok in your deck as possible, as quickly as possible, because those are all the best damage dealers* and chain with one another.

Thus, although the game appears to have good ideas both for two-player and multiplayer, it also has overwhelming flaws with both, so it's not perfect with any number of players.

*: (Except Big Ghost, who is also good in two-player, but harder to use because he doesn't chain with the other power cards as easily)

BIG theme mistake:

Almost every minion in the game has a specific name, not a title. For a deck-building game, this was actually the deal-breaker for me. I didn't buy the game - hey, it's a crowded marketplace, I can pick and choose from a horde of great games, games with better themic-implementations (if you know what I mean).

I'd much rather 3 'lesser vampires' fight it out, than have 3 'Harry Fisto' [not an actual card] characters attack each other.

I like the direction this is taking deck building games.  Drafting some specialized options for your deck makes a lot of sense... but with such a small draft there isn't a whole lot of planning involved.  The forced combat was a nice touch and I really enjoy the concept of chaining... but I wonder if they held too much back for expansion mechanics with the base set (Wounds not being differentiated mechanically... not many special powers on the critters).  I'm also not really a fan of the mixed bag theme and would have preferred a game just about Werewolves (or vampires... or post-apocalyptic humans...)

Nightfall brings a unique spin to the deck building genre by allowing the players to directly attack one another.  This completely changes the feel of deck building games and allows Nightfall to create a truly unique experience.

I also have to admit I am head over heels in love with the theme.  No nobles trying to conquer estates or wizards attempting to obtain mystical stones of power.  Instead you have all the creatures of the night slaughtering each other for dominance over a land enshrouded by eternal night.  Love it!

The chain mechanism is very cool but difficult for colorblind people

Quite a breath of fresh air after so many games of dominion. If it will hold our interest, only time can tell.

Nigthfall is a okay game, but I have some complaints about the game.

The Card stock isn't of bad quality, but not as good as in games like Dominion and 7 Wonders. You shuffle a lot in this game, so I really wish it was better.

The rules don't feel a smooth as they should. It's a good idea to read the FAQ here on Board Game Geek. 

I think the base game is a base to ad some expansion on and the game could have been a good game if the rigth expansions where made, but the expansions hurt the game instead of helping it - this just show how important it is to how a little bid about game balance and statistics when you make board games.

My favorite deck building game.  Chaining is a very neat mechanic.  It also dramatically increases the amount of player interaction and reduces downtime.

Hmm.  I enjoyed my first two plays, but I also got the sense that it's not very skill-based.  Seems like the winner might well be determined by the cards he managed to pull in the very small draft.  Probably a poor Dominion wannabe.

It did feel more focused than Thunderstone though.  And Nightfall has a fairly kickass rulebook.

It could easily become my favourite deckbuilding game of all time. Confrontational, quick and engaging.

Unnecessarily complex.  And I'm pretty much over the deckbuilding thing.  I've gotten rid of all of them save Core Worlds which isn't really even a deckbuilder.

Love the game with a sense of Magic and a sense of deck building but with its own unique thing of chain and wounds.All the elements combined well and works well for me and the artwork and theme is ok.
I definitely recommend the variant rule of publishing the public decks first than drafting and picking personal one because of more think and strategy this way instead of luck.
The only fault of the game i think is about the random picking of the public cards instead of sets，it makes lots of chains unavailable lots of strategies.

After 1 Play: I like the chaining mechanic and how it can reward diversifying your deck.  However, any enjoyment I might get out of the game is ruined by the scoring system.  Instead of earning points for yourself, you only advance by doling out negative points to your opponents.  The decision of who to attack is far too arbitrary, and in the end the player who wins is not the one who builds and plays the best deck, but the one who manages to attract the least attention.

The free-for-all element of choosing which player you hit is a bit nasty. Otherwise a very exciting game.

This is a great little card game that adds some solid confrontation to the deck-building concept of old and wraps it all up in some awesome theming and artwork. The game plays quickly and brutally, and the expansions add interesting wrinkles without complicating things.

On the downside, some of the cards can feel samey and the game is a little unintuitive and hard to teach.

So chaotic as to be disappointingly flawed, and yet the chain mechanic is so alluring...

It might be due to using the base set only, but it felt like the minion cards were just outperforming the action cards up to the point where none of us were drafting actions.

Also, all games ended with whoever drafted the beefiest minions (I tried some strategies with blocking and healing, and it only slowed down my inevitable demise).

The chaining mechanic, although apparently clever at first, tends to give an unwarranted edge to whoever happens to have the right colors at the time (by playing last on top of the active player's cards).

All in all, I did not enjoy my experience with this deckbuilding game (to a point where I'd rather play Dominion instead which, in my case, is saying a lot).

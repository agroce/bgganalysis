RATING: 7
This game was really hard for me to rate.  I was so excited for this game to come out when it was initially announced, and I was very disappointed when they decided to move away from the coop game it was initially.  When I first played it, I was very disappointed.  I wanted the game to be epic and highly thematic like the Decipher Star Wars CCG from the '90s, and on those counts it falls short.

I've now played the game a couple dozen times and have decided that I do like it, but not as much as I would have liked to like it (if that makes any sense).  The gameplay is solid, quick, and quite strategic, but there are still times where something happens thematically that is so preposterous I just have to groan (for example, force lightning taking down the Home One or certain units committing to the force, like droids or a wampa).

I want to make a quick comment about the deck building aspect of this game: I like it.  It makes deck building both easier and more challenging.  It's easy to throw together 10 objective sets and try them out, but it's harder to sit down and choose the best 10 sets for a good deck.  There aren't a lot of deck options right now, but I think this problem will disappear with more expansions.

+Solid gameplay with good strategic depth.
+Edge battles add an interesting bluffing game.
+Some individual cards are quite thematic, like Han shooting first or Ackbar's "it's a trap!".

=Plays quickly (usually in 30-45 min)

-Doesn't capture the epic feel of Star Wars like the Decipher CCG did.
-Some card interactions are very non-thematic, or require a great deal of rationalization to make sense (droids and wampas committing to the force, ground units defeating space units).

2 copies. 

Just discovering, but loving it do far. 

Edit:

Love this game. It's got tough decisions, drama, and excitement in spades. The only thing that keeps this from being a 10 for me is a disconnect with the theme. It's not the art, which I like, it's that the gameplay doesn't really feel like how I'd expected a card game about Star Wars to feel. For the theme to come out a bit more appropriately, I would have expected something a little easier, a little looser, a little faster.

Anyway, for me great mechanics trump theme disconnect so I'm very happy with the game.

The Star Wars LCG has beautiful components. The edge battles and the force struggle got included in the gameplay pretty well and make such a huge difference theme wise. Nice. Luck in drawing cards could end a game soon.

I love LCGs and was quite sceptical with this one. Played all of them from FFG pretty serious and have to say that SWLCG offers the cleanest rules, a great game structure and is easy to learn but hard to master. Quality-wise on the same level as Netrunner and definitely higher than the Warhammer LCGs and CoC.

Not really my thing.  It seems like it rewards frequent and repeated play, which isn't a luxury I possess.  Way too many rules for my liking.  But it seems well-designed and well-produced, so I'm sure those in this particular niche will adore it.

+ The theme and art, oh my gosh, the theme and art; Clever hand-management required in order to optimize your units, edge battles, and force struggles.
- Gameplay seems to be slightly more luck-driven than some of the other LCGs that I've gotten into; As an LCG, there is a pretty steep learning curve to get a new player interested in the game.

I love the pace and asymmetry of this game. The unique deck construction format makes for some really interesting decisions: a single objective set affects ~10% of your deck, and you're forced to weigh the value of six cards at a time rather than a simple one-to-one comparison.

And, unlike Netrunner, it feels comfortable as a boxed game with just the large expansions. This is a big plus now that pack rotation has been announced and only the big box expansions are permanently legal.

RATING: 8
Typical Fantasy Flight LCG set in the Star Wars universe featuring very nice graphic design. The catch in this one is the use of force, which you have to balance at the end of every turn and it gives an edge either to the Empire (hurrying up the construction of the Death Star) or the Rebel Alliance (additional damage). The goal of the Empire is to build the mighty Death Star, which means surviving the Rebel push for 12 turns max. The Rebels on the other hand have to destroy at least three imperial ”facilities” in order to win. The game

RATING: 7
Very good card game, a lot more complex design than The Lord of The Rings: LCG but not so much than Android: Netrunner. There is assimetry in the way the two sides can win, but there is no assimetry in gameplay as Android: Netrunner. So it is a game that stands between TLOTR: The Card Game and Android: Netrunner. The art here, as in TLOTR and A:NR is fantastic, and the lcg system benefits the game a lot, I liked the way you can introduce the sets of cards in your deck, seems to make easy the deckbuilding.

You've heard the quotes: an LCG with fewer decisions that tries to make those decisions matter more.  The edge battle is what makes this unique.  The theme is obviously a winner.  You can absolutely buy the core set and have fun, but once you play you'll end up buying a few more boxes/packs to expand your choices some.

Game play wise, I really like a lot of things going on. Timing rules are unique and cool, edge fighting is innovative, the stats resolving is great. My complaint comes with the deck building aspect. The game design feels far too limiting in terms of building. Tying cards to objectives and building a deck that way strips out the fun of deckbuilding inherent in every CCG/LCG/TCG style game.

RATING: 7
Άλλο ένα LCG από την Fantasy Flight Games στο κόσμο του Star Wars αυτή τη φορά. Εμμ αφού έχει το licence να μην το ξεζουμίσει όσο μπορεί; Για να δούμε τι καινούργιο φέρνει στο τραπέζι το συγκεκριμένο παιχνίδι.

Ο ένας παίκτης παίρνει το ρόλο των ανταρτών διαλέγοντας ανάμεσα σε Jedi και Rebel Alliance, ενώ ο άλλος παίρνει τον ρόλο της Αυτοκρατορίας διαλέγοντας ανάμεσα σε Sith και Imperial Navy. Στο παιχνίδι υπάρχουν και αλλά 2 factions, οι Smugglers And Spies και οι Scum And Villainy αλλά δεν είναι playable μόνο με το core set. Να σημειώσω πως βρίσκω το artwork εξαιρετικό ενώ θεματικά βρισκόμαστε στα χρόνια των παλιών κλασσικών ταινιών. 

Η κατασκευή της τράπουλας είναι μια πολύ απλή διαδικασία. Αντί να διαλέγεις τις κάρτες μια-μια, πλέον επιλέγεις απλά 10 objectives και παίρνεις τις κάρτες που πάνε πακέτο με το κάθε objective. Απλοποιείτε λοιπόν το deck building και μου άρεσε που δεν κάθεσαι να ξεψειρίσεις την τράπουλα αλλά αντιθέτως αναγκάζεσαι να χρησιμοποιήσεις και μέτριες κάρτες.

Σκοπός για τους Imperials είναι να κρατήσουν άμυνα για 12 (το πολύ) γύρες ώστε να είναι έτοιμο το Death Star ενώ οι rebels προσπαθούν με ανταρτοπόλεμο να καταστρέψουν 3 από τα objective των Imperial Από πλευρά μηχανισμών συναντάμε μεν το old school σύστημα «παίζει ο ένας όλη τη γύρα του και μετά παίζει ο επόμενος» snore αλλά τουλάχιστον γλυτώνουμε το αρχικό build up καθώς ξεκινάμε με 4-5 resources καθένας και μπορούμε να μπούμε αμέσως στην δράση. 

Παράλληλα με το κυρίως παιχνίδι παίζουμε και ένα mini game καθώς διαλέγουμε μερικές δυνάμεις μας να ασχοληθούν με το Force. Αν η δύναμη είναι μαζί σου τότε παίρνεις ένα σημαντικό δωράκι στην αρχή του γύρου. Δωρεάν damage σε objective ή δωρεάν γύρο για το Death Star.

Γενικά το παιχνίδι είναι ένα κλικ πιο κάτω σε πολυπλοκότητα από τα υπόλοιπα LCG της FFG. Όπως είπα από άποψη μηχανισμών δείχνει κάπως outdated γιατί η αλήθεια είναι πως έχουμε καλομάθει με το Conquest, το Netrunner, το LotR και το Game of Thrones. Το Star Wars δείχνει να απευθύνεται περισσότερο προς το casual κοινό.

Μπορεί να το βαθμολογώ κάπως πιο κάτω από τα υπόλοιπα LCG αλλά η αλήθεια είναι πως το theme παίζει πολύ βασικό ρόλο στην κατηγορία αυτή. Αν είστε φαν του Star Wars αυτό είναι το καρτοπαίχνιδο σας, μην ακούτε τα αρνητικά σχόλια.

Here we go again. Another foray into FF's LCG. Call of Cthulhu was a flop. Lord of the Rings wore out its welcome. And you couldn't pay us to try Android : Netrunner. But this has two things going for it. Ease of play and theme. Thank goodness FF hasn't used anything from the prequels yet. Oh please don't do it FantasyFlight! The ease of play comes from how you build the decks. You don't sort through individual cards to make a deck and either A)hope you get the right combos to do well or B) spend days perfecting your deck to destroy everyone. You pick objectives to be used in play and taking the 5 cards corresponding to them. WE LOVE THIS! That individual card selection was what drove us nuts when we used to play YuGiOh! and it's what killed Lord of the Rings. So this set up is so much better. It's only at a 7 because we haven't played it enough. But there is the one problem with it. The committing characters to the Force to tip the Balance of the Force. Ok. We can see the mechanism for it is and respect the strategy it adds to the game. But we so wish it wasn't in there. It just makes the game fiddly in that regard. Alas there seems to be no way to play without it. But we will continue to enjoy it even with that aspect.

I love the mechanics, let me start with that.  The mechanics for this game are fantastic.  The rules, the cards, even the deck building method are all good in my opinion.

I rated it lower because truthfully, I'm just not having much fun playing it for the moment.  And this isn't a knock on the game, I admit.  I just definitely don't 'get' what I should be doing.  In time, I will, and when I do, I'll rate this up more to reflect my current interest in playing the game.  In the meantime, however, I have to keep it lower :(

Update in May: I'm getting the game much better now, at least well enough to win.  I definitely love the game, although it's missing... something.  I can't figure out just what.

This is a fun card game. I haven't gotten deep into the deck construction yet (I might not ever to be honest) but I have one deck of each faction and am having a really fun time.

Love the artwork, the game is smooth and actually fun, however I'm not a big fan of the whole two faction, two-player setup, I wish this had a bunch of them similar to Warhammer 40K Conquest, etc. Also deck building with the card sets is a little strange.

While not yet comparable to its CCG predecessor, this one shows promise. Gameplay is tighter and the base mechanics are solid, but it will be some time before themes and variety emerge beyond "good stuff" decks.

Bad luck of the draw can be completely crippling, as the game is very tempo reliant and can suffer from snowballing wins, but the game plays fast enough that you can just deal another hand and go again.

very much in anticipation to seeing how the multiplayer rules turn out, as while head-to-head is fun, I could see it hit the table even more often with group play.

RATING: 6
Még szoknom kell:) Fő vonásait tekintve ez is olyan, mint a többi LCG: egyrészt pénznyelő, másrészt azt éreztem, hogy 10-20 parti kellene, hogy igazán ráérezzek az ízére. Egy játék csak arra volt elég, hogy nagyjából képet kapjak a mechanizmusáról. Nem rossz! Aszimmetrikus a két oldal, a többfunkciós kártyák jó kis dilemmát visznek bele, a képek alapján ráismerhetünk a filmbeli szereplőkre, nem úgy mint a LOTR lcg-nél. Fanoknak kötelező. A műfajból eredően nyelvfüggő. Nekem a téma talán a LOTR-ban jött át jobban, de az a Halálcsillag jelző azért itt is rásegít az érzésre:) Meg a képek.

RATING: 7
I am a die-hard Star Wars fan since childhood, like almost every guy my age. But somehow I never found any SW themed game attractive enough to dive in. FFG is slowly making me rethinking my positions.

Star Wars LCG is good, like almost any other LCG. But it is also different enough from the others to have its niche. And amazingly the mechanics succeed in capturing the theme!

Gameplay is slightly asymmetrical: while both factions do exactly the same things, Dark Side is more interested in being defensive, since it will win if the game drags, while Light Side is the aggro.

I particularly like the edge battles, used to determine initiative (and additional combat capabilities) during fights: at first they felt dull, but they definitely add tension and surprise to battles!

A very very good game, with the only downside lying in the deckbuilnding system: I like what FFG did here, and the chance of jumping in with semi-random builds for newbies... but I am a deck building lover, so I miss the chance to fine-tuning decks...

RATING: 6
Still on the fence, I enjoy the game - the artwork and theme is fantastic - BUT, the game tends to favor defensive play, and I'm worried that the tactics icons as they become more prevalent will only increase that.  I'm not a fan of the prevalence of exhaust your opponents board type strategies.  Most CCG's learned pretty quickly that this isn't a play style that most players find "fun".

Edit - I've upped my rating with the addtion of some expansions, like most of FFG's LCG's, one core set just doesn't give enough variety.  But if you are willing to buy a few expansions, the game improves significantly.  And then decreased it again, just too much overhead for the amount of fun, and balance issues are creeping in.  Sold - got out while the gettin was good

Lots of flair, beautiful art, a deck construction that actually works and is very enjoyable to experiment with.

Lang was also responsible for other blockbusters and this is on par with games like XCom etc. I like the games he produces.

Impressed after a few plays with this.

Going up to 9.1. I really missed out on this Card game, but it is an incredible good system.

What a pleasant surprise and the solo games found on BGG actually work for 99% of the time. As good as any solo mode included with published games.

The solo play is certainly a terrific tool to enhance your play, but I like it as such.

UPDATED in January 2016. Just after a month of playing this thing I put it up in my absolute top 10 of ALL games included. Sorry but this game is dynamite.

Best card game I played. Stop.

RATING: 4.1
When FFG aquired the Star Wars licence probably one of the first things they thought was to make a LCG out of it. Unfortunately the result of this endeavor has very much disappointed me and my son, both huge Star Wars fans.

My son (11 years old) pretty much summarized it after our second play: "This might as well be Dinosaurs vs Ninjas". And he was right. The thematic disconnect between the game and the Star Wars universe is unforgivable. At no point in the game do you feel like you're playing a Star Wars game. The combat is ridiculous! X-wings fighting Storm Troopers, Force Lightning taking down Home One?! Really? The way they abstracted the force also was a huge turn off for us. Committing Tie Fighters to the force? You've got to be kidding. When is FFG going to learn that a bunch of flavor text and some great artwork does not constitute a theme.

Besides the thematic problems the game isn't even that good. The lack of real deck building and the lack of depth are unfortunate. The combat system is decent but get's destroyed with the edge battle. While this sort of mechanic can work, look at the duels in L5R, it does not here. The edge battle is much too random. And loosing it can be so unthematically devastating. Losing half your firepower because the other player just has better cards in hand is no fun. Which brings me to another problem. Where is the fun in the game? The lack of control and a pretty fiddly game system sucked the last possible remnants of enjoyment out of the game. Lasty, once one player gets ahead the game is pretty much over. It is very difficult to get back into the game when you're down. Which also doesn't add to the fun factor. All in all, severely disappointing!

My favorite FFG asymmetrical LCG. Maybe due to the theme, but I also like that deck building is simplified. By using 6 card sets to build decks, themes can easily be achieved without the card by card minutia of trying to 'perfect' a deck.

And the game play ends up being fun and thematic. Though I tend to set like decks against each other i.e. rbel starships vs imperial starships, Jedi vs Sith, etc. - you can still have fun with Jedi vs Navy or Sith vs Smugglers.

This game is bad ass! I played the original Decipher CCG so I can compare it to that pinnacle of design with some degree of credibility. This game does an excellent job of conveying a sense of Star Wars to the players. The 6 affiliations all have different feels to them (Go Imperial Navy!) and by mixing them together you can shore up weaknesses while simultaneously creating new ones. The deckbuilding is pure genius and really allows even a newer player to jump right in and build good decks. The fact that it's an LCG instead of the old CCG design levels the playing field and makes skill the ultimate deciding factor. Pick this game up. End of story.

Star Wars seems like a solid card game. Ive only played a single learning game so far and would like to get in a few more plays to get a better feel for the game. The theme and art are great (of course, it's Star Wars, so how couldn't they?), but the mechanics seemed a little fiddly and uninspired. Definitely not bad, but aside from the Edge Battles (which I'm still kind of on the fence about), there wasn't much new here. But like I said, I definitely need to give this game a few more plays.

seen it all before LCG card game , core set is utter rip off you get very very little for your cash 
- FFG has killed Star Wars !!  

 i give it a 4 based on theme alone - no innovation , a LCG that would have been fresh 20 years ago!! now sadly stinks the house out 

Cards + abilities are all the usual mechanics seen in every other LCG , ho hum! if this game was on any other theme it would sink without trace in a month... really very disppointed 

avoid - deckbuilding rules are objective based rubbish, edge battles are an unnecessary mechanic added into the game to try and make it feel 'unique' 

all in all woeful
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
After playing 20+ games, IMO, the new Star Wars Card Game is a fusion of FFG's other LCG.  Six factions the same as Warhammer: Invasion, the icon struggle similar to Call of Cthulhu TCG, the objective resource is similar to Lord of the Rings TCG Hero resource.

I don't have Game of Throne TCG and don't know if anything from that game is copy, modifier and paste to SWTCG.

The arts from the game is good, but SWCCG's movie picture card is still my favorite.

The SWTCG game play fast and fun.  It is a good game and better than many card/board game in the top 100 of the BGG ranking.

I don't have the problem for luke and red 5 co-exit in the same time and combat together in the same objective.  I don't mind the abstract nature of the combat (icon struggle) that spaceship, creature and character combat the same objective.

When I was much younger I played the Star Wars CCG, I still have some decks laying around somewhere. To say I was looking forward to this game would be something of an understatement. I finally got around to playing this on March 29th 2013 after having it age in my collection for a few months. In my mind it's not an overally complicated game, sure the edge battles are alittle card to explain but I got through it. My opponant on the other hand didn't like it at all. He seemed to struggle through the game and that is unusual for him. Overall though I'm really going to have to play this a few more times with a few more people to form an opinion on it.

With all that said I'm looking forward to the expansion coming out soon that ups the number of players.

Happy to find that I don't agree with the generally negative initial vibes that permeated bgg. Enjoyed my first few plays of this. Of course it is abstracted. It's a game.

Use of objective sets rather than individual cards for customization is an interesting idea. And the play felt competitive enough. But, just didn't intrigue in the way that A:NR or MTG does. Plus, the use of theme wasn't as satisfying as it is other SW games.

Excellent game this one. Plenty of tension as you go back and forth with the building of the Death Star as a timer on the game and the balance of the force being able to make the difference. I like theway decks are built too. Pick one card and get 6 in one go, makes it much easier and quicker to build a deck if you are strapped for time. 6 Plays.

My 8 year old came to the game store with me and I said he could pick out one game. He went and started to grab these $100 games and I started to steer him towards something more suitable. He then saw Star Wars and I told him it was a 2 player card game. He jumped at it. We tried it out once, and I realised we need to get more of a grip of the cards, and I finally got someone at SaltCON to go through a game with me. Unfortunately the game teacher was ALL about crushing me in the game... more than teaching me anything. Oh well, I then went and watched some videos and I think Elijah and I can have a lot more fun with this very soon. Plus my FLGS is starting to do some tournaments and I will be popping along to them. I don't mind if those guys flatten me, I can learn just by playing the game more.

The deckbuilding might be a bit simpler in this game than in more XCGs, but the game itself is at least as complicated as most, and honestly, it seems more complicated than MtG. It has some interesting ideas, like being able to attack immediately, or the plentiful card draw, however, playing with only the core deck was a frustrating experience as the Jedi player drew all their best cards and the Sith player didn't. And the good cards the Sith player did draw were immediately neutralised by the Jedi player. It was just an exercise in frustration. We didn't even finish the game. The Sith player was very possibly going to win on time, even though the Jedi player was now dominating, but they weren't having any fun, so we called the game and put it away.

In retrospect, it also suffered from a lack of cool things happening. Most of the cards were ho hum. There's nothing cool about putting random character I've never heard of who doesn't do anything special into play. And that is most of the game. Giving Luke a light saber was probably the coolest thing to happen during the game, but it wasn't all that cool.

I have played this a couple of times, but never won.  I like that the decks are built by card sets instead of random cards, which cuts down on the implied need to pick up multiple copies of the base game and/or expansions.

The downside is that there are a lot of expansions out there for game, making it almost as big of an investment as any CCG.

I really like how this game was designed and plays out.  Each side has a different goal to accomplish and the game can sometimes switch the winning side with that next turn's draw.  The only thing I hate is that I don't get to play enough.  Not a lot of people play at my game store.  I prefer casual play with this game to tournament.  I enjoy making strange decks and seeing how they stand up.  Doesn't work to well in tournaments.  The living card design aspect is great too, so I can buy what packs I want and not have to worry about playing a bought deck compared to a designed deck.

I wanted to like this game.  Star Wars. FFG LCG.  What could go wrong?  The mechanics seem decent but I just don't have fun playing the game.  I just don't feel like I am playing a *Star Wars* game or that my actions even remotely resemble the SW universe in any way.  

Netrunner screams theme: I feel like I am attacking an evil corporation or defending it from ne'er-do-wells.  Game of Thrones seems like a bloody treacherous war.  Lord of the Rings punishes the adventurous fellowship.  All of these game sessions tell a story that are set in the exact world they represent. SW:TCG does no such thing.

One of the greatest games I ever played. It has so many different characters, vehicles, locations and many other types of cards, so you can build 3 or 4 different decks even with this core set.
It is for the more advanced players, because its rules are more complex than most TCGs (Magic the Gathering, Vanguard etc.)
The two sides (Light and Dark) require a very different strategy. The art is nice.
One of my favorites.

This is definitely the strongest Core Set of any of Fantasy Flight's LCGs that I have played (which is all save for Cthulu). The decks that you're building with two Cores feel tighter and more efficient than those 2x Core decks that can be built for, say, Thrones. However, over time my taste for the deck building has diminished. I don't particularly enjoy it. As such, we never really pull this out much anymore and just play Thrones instead.

RATING: 9.4
I love Star Wars, so I'm obviously predisposed to like this game, but, truly, this is the best designed 2-player competitive card game that I've played. It solved so many problems. The Edge battles mean there is no such thing as a useless card. The usage of objective sets for building your decks makes the concept very accessible and balanced. Gameplay is smooth and easy to learn. That said, you really, really have to buy two core sets. Playing with only one core set makes the game too random and unsatisfying to play.

RATING: 9
Of the LCGs I've tried, I found Star Wars to be the one I enjoyed the most.

For me it captured the excitement and adventure of the Star Wars universe, with a quick to pick up and difficult to master game.

The asymmetrical play style allows for a different feel, whether you play Light or Dark side and the different factions all have a different feel about them.

If it wasn't for a lack of players in my area, this would be one of the few games I'd ever play.

Absolutely love this game. It's fun to sit down and play, and is the kind of game where you get out of it what you put into it. You can take the time to work around with your objective sets (which is an interesting mechanic, by the way), and see how they work together. And there are more coming out all the time, which only adds variety and strategy to the game as a whole. Can't say enough good about the game. The only reason I'm not scoring it higher is because the gaming community (at least in my area) isn't as big as other games like Android: Netrunner. But once that changes, I can imagine there will a lot more play time.

Love this game, hate the deck-building. The concept of Objective pods is neat, but really limits what you can do. Even after a year now, it seems like decks are a pain to build and there are a ton of objectives that don't ever get used b/c their cards are junk.

FFG's design philosophy also seems to be totally Anti-Combo.  Yes, there are some cards that have synergy, but there's nothing like the normal card combos that you see in most other games, where 3-4 cards used in conjunction mean you win. This is both a good and bad thing.

Proof of this is that they just released a Restricted list, b/c they introduced two cards that had a very strong combo and then immediately ruled that you couldn't build a deck with both cards in it. Sigh.... considering that these cards were released in back-to-back Force Packs, it really makes me question the level of play-testing being done in this game.

I'm enjoying this a lot more than I expected. I heard that some people weren't enjoying this because of the "my Ewok killed Darth Vader" issue.

As it turns out, it doesn't bother me or my wife at all. She's enjoying the game as much as I am. This may replace Netrunner as my favourite LCG.

Preliminary rating after 3 plays. Star Wars LCG, while not better than Netrunner, was a positive surprise. The edge battle mechanic adds some much needed tension (and luck) to what would otherwise be a pretty dry combat system. The sides seem balanced enough although we did have some troulbe winning as the dark side. Excellent components and art, as expected from Fantasy Flight Games.

I don't know why I waited until 2016 to play this.  I love it!  The games can really forge little narratives as they develop.  I'm not a big fan of deckbuilding in general (I usually netdeck), but the way this game does deckbuilding, I don't really mind.  I also like that you can have multiple decks put together at once since there are not "general use" cards that appear in every deck.  Another bonus is the assymetry of play: I don't have to get my friends into this as I have plenty of light side and dark side stuff to play around with for all of us.

Fun fact: I like Star Wars even more than Call of Cthulhu lcg, but I rate CoC higher than SW, because I want to play it more than SW. Nevertheless, SW is a great game. What I like about it is variety. Each game is unique; factions are different. Within each faction (or affiliation) there is a number of choices to be made. You can build a deck around powerful but slow and costly naval ships if you choose Imperial Navy or you can go different way and build a deck around stormtroopers. If choose sith you can recruit powerful villians or build a deck around small units. This variety is typical for this game.
The process of deckbuilding is easy, the differencies between factions are distinguishable,each faction has its own unique trais, so you'll never be bored with this game. Tired of Emperial Navy? Try Smugglers instead!
What is the most important is that developers update this game every two months or so. They release new packs with new cards, new mechanics. They always make an emphasis on some feature of this game. Recently they introduced characters that work in unique way during force struggles. They also add new ships and event cards as well. Due to all this the interest never diminishes.

Love this game... BUT.... its hard to learn ( for most people) , and harder to master. The living card element is of my taste.

I don't think it falls in a thematic game, i have always felt that you can Slap any license, and the will work ok.

I've gone through an arc with this game. Initially i hated it. Then after playing quite a bit i sort i've liked it. Now i hate it more than i did when i started.

Reasons this game sucks;

1. way too many cards on the table, way too much card specific text to memorise. To have a competitive chance i need to understand how around 40 different cards are interacting with each other at any given time.

2. no build up. In most card games you build up your forces then stuff kicks off. In this game its kicking off from turn 2. You have very little time to get into things.

3. Does nothing for me on a thematic level. Feels like a card game, not starwars

4. too much action in one turn. You can go from winning to eliminated in one round if your opponent has lots of moves he or she can make. Its rather tiresome sitting and watching your opponent take 5 minutes knocking you out when you can do so little about it.

5. Netrunner and Magic are better on every level.

My gripe is that the base set really is incomplete without a cupple expansions.

RATING: 7.5
Early rating, based on limited plays.  It seems like a neat game with some interesting and unique elements (like the edge battles, the asymetric victory objectives, and the force struggle mechanic).  Haven't played it enough to know yet if it will have the depth and longevity of games like Magic or LotR LCG, but it does have potential.

Docked it at least half a rating point due to the distribution model used by FFG.  Competitive play, and even balanced casual play, requires 2 of every objective set, but the core set and big expansions only include one, therefore requiring you to buy 2 of them.  I've heard the excuses that the price would double if they included 2 of each - I don't buy it.  They have to be able to sell these games to retailers at a deep discount and still turn a profit, so probably roughly 50% of the MSRP is profit margin.  Packaging, the color rulebook, and the nice tokens and death star dial account for a sizable amount of the remainder.  There is no reason to pay for that expensive packaging twice on the core set and every big expansion.  They don't sell the smaller expansion packs that way - why the big ones?  I'd rather pay 5 bucks more and get enough cards to have a good game rather than 5 bucks less and be told that if I want a 'complete' game I have to buy it twice and pay the profit margin twice and for stuff I don't need two copies of (such as the color rulebook, the expensive packaging, and the tokens).

RATING: 4
I want to like this: incredible artwork, nice inclusion of The Force both short-term (edgo battles) and long-term (Force Struggle), but the game itself is underwhelming after a few intro plays. Compounding the problem: the typeface is so small that I have to squint to read my own cards. It's possible that the strategy is very high, and appears after many plays, but there are a lot of CCG/LCGs out there these days. A game has to be good from the get-go. 

The biggest problems with CCG/LCGs are: deckbuilding (you need experience, and you need time to build); rule density (it takes a while to get good at these games); opponents (it's hard to find regular people to play against). I'll stick with Magic, because I've taken care of all three objections.

My initial impression was mediocre, briefly improved, and has nosedived since. 

I just don't find the decisions interesting. I'd rather play Magic for the battles, Lord of the Rings for the theme, Netrunner for the asymmetry.

Like so many others my age, I'm finding I'm a Star Wars geek again, and I'm excited about this. As is typical for me, I've ended up with a large-ish collection quickly:

Core x2
Edge Of Darkness x2
The entire Hoth cycle

Thankfully, this is a great game. Also - and I realize this is probably motivated primarily by studio copyright - I like the original art on the cards & leaders, as opposed to photo stills from the movies. It's just a nice touch.

RATING: 6
I enjoy this game, but aside from the cards it just doesn't get the feeling of Star Wars across enough.  I like the mechanics, but I would have liked more asymmetrical play between light side and dark side. Also, the game can get really swingy, you have less deck-building control than in other games (not always a bad thing, mind you) and until FFG stops giving the Imperial Navy literally every great card they design, its gonna stay lower.  I rate every LCG on a scale relative to Netrunner, so bear that in mind.

Excellent game with tremendous replayability and strategic depth. My gateway into competitive LCGs. See my blog for a detailed review.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
PROS:
- Star Wars!
- Very very tightly designed game that is quick but robust and complex.
- Fairly quick to set up and play.
- Very cool art direction. Really captures the feel of the universe.
- Quite expandable, once you get a few Force Packs you have a huge variety of options.
- LCG rather than blind CCG.
- Dark and Light side play differently, as well as each faction having very unique strengths and weakness's. 
- One of the best rule books I've read.
- Rewards players who spend time in the game. Not really a pick-up-and-play sort of deal.
- Edge Battles make the game interesting and unpredictable and causes a lot of interesting choices. This seems to be one of the biggest gripes about the game, but I think it makes for tension, bluffing, gives all cards a duel purpose. 
- Force struggle is always fun and can make or break your strategy if you don't conciser it. 
- Deck Building (now that there are a bunch of options) is awesome. Yes, it is simple, yet it makes your deck building moments more important. The deckbuilding used to be a con for me, but now that they've released a large number of options it is a Pro.

CONS:
- Pretty complex and hard to teach (this is a pro and a con in my book).
- Requires a bucket of money to be competitive (2 Base sets ($80), 2 Edge of Darkness expansions ($40), plus any Force Packs you may want ($15 each), you've just spend a couple hundred dollars on it. The good thing is, there are no stupid "ultra rares" that skew the game.
- Abstract game mechanics do not simulate some situations well. For instance, a TaunTaun defeating a Star Destroyer is a little far fetched. You can say that the TaunTaun allowed for a faceless character to get aboard a X-Wing that got on board the Star Destroyer and sabotaged it... If you're a theme purist, this game will find ways to irritate you.

Not as amazing as Android: Netrunner, but a fine LCG nonetheless. Fairly well-balanced (at first, it felt like the Dark Side had a heavy advantage, but that feeling eventually faded).

Nehéz egy LCG-t pár játék alapján megítélni. Az biztos, hogy a star wars nálam nagy hátránnyal indul, mivel a témája egyáltalán nem fog meg. Játékmenetben viszont nagyon érdekes. Különösen az edge battle tetszik benne, jó kis blöffölős lehetőség, ami színt visz a játékba. Tetszik a megkötött pakliépítés is, mert így talán jobban kordában tudják tartani a dolgokat a készítők, nem kell annyi verhetetlen kombóra felkészülni. Viszont elég nehezen tanulható, nekem úgy 3. 4. játékra kezdtek összeállni a szabályok, és még még mindig csak blödli hibákkal tarkított játékra vagyok képes. Szóval jó sokat lehet vele tolni.

The Star Wars card game looks like a mix between various CCGs/LCGs with a Star Wars theme slapped on. It doesn't feel particularly thematic, but my main complaint is that it feels overly complicated in parts. I'm also not a fan of having one player (the Dark Side) being incentivized to turtle and constantly aiming to just drag the game out.

Fun two player head to head card game akin to M:TG.  Not super interested in living card games, as they can become money sinks, but the theme on this one got me to at least pick up a few expansions.  Attacking objectives is fine, but I think I prefer just bashing my opponent to zero life like in M:TG better.  Probably won't be expanding this game any further, as its hitting the table less and less these days.

I think that the game will feel more "complete" with a second base set and a complete cycle of expansions, not to mention the deluxe expansion for the smugglers and scum and villainy.  The factions have their own style of play to make the most use of them , and most of the theme shines through.

I feel i will play again, but Im really needing to be convinced why I should play this game apart from the card art, as the randomness of the cards you get early in hand in the few games played suggests it is a bit too luck based (Rating 6; August 2014).  UPDATE: Art and theme just aint enough, rating 5 and gone (Dec 14). UPDATE 3SF 5.014 Jan 17.

Learning curve is a tad steep if user has never played an LCG from FFG. After learning, it is a game that keeps on giving. There are so many ways to play it and strategies continue to develop! The art is fantastic as well. 

For anyone who loves a good LCG or almost perfect 1 v 1 game. This is it!

So far I'm loving this game. It's blazingly fast, which could be a downside for some but is a plus in my mind. The theme is good enough, and the deck-building is the best I have ever seen (for me) because it's so quick and simple. My wife has agreed to build a deck, something she has NEVER done for any other game.

This definitely gets a +1 point in my rating for the theme. I'm not even a big Star Wars fan, but it's better than Star Trek, or Lord of the Rings which is just overdone at this point. So Star Wars is about the only "named" theme that seems cool.

So the game itself is fairly good, but it just has too many pointy edges to the rules that prevent it from being great.

Such an excellent game. I am really enjoying the SW universe so the tie in definitely helps. The game has great depth and the abstraction works. The edge battles are such a fun and key part of the game that takes a little bit to understand its importance. Same with force struggle. These are often criticized as being to abstract or not good with the themes but not there once you have better game knowledge and consistent decks.  I have all the current cards up to Endor cycle.

After a couple dozen plays, I'm really enjoying Star Wars: The Card Game.  The gameplay is great: there are interesting decisions every turn, the two sides play and "feel" differently, and our games have often been very close.  It's also quick: we've had games as quick as 10-15 minutes, though most are more like 30-45 minutes.  

And for me, the theme is a huge plus.  Almost every card resonates with me from the movies.  It's just plain fun to slap down Obi-Wan or Vader or even R2.  Even the flavor text is awesome.  Some people have trouble with what they see as thematic disconnects, as when you use Lightsaber Deflection to redirect damage from a unit that's not firing blasters at you.  Me, I just conceptualize the events as part of a larger conflict: as rancors trample rebels planetside, Luke deflects a light saber from a trooper on board the Death Star.  Besides, often there is a perfect "match" between combat styles, which is all the more satisfying.

Really loving this.  Can't wait for the expansions, and for some organized play.

The best card game I ever played.

First of all, the pod idea is simply fantastic - you can set a Imperial Navy vs Rebels on Hoth in a breeze, without too much hassle with the deckbuilding (nothing against it, but it takes a lot of time).

Next, strategy and tactics. The advantage struggle is nerve wracking, while committing to the Force, balancing attacking and defending units, even where and when to take resources are nailbiting stuff. Furthermore, the victory conditions are asymmetrical, adding to the challenge.

Last but not least, the playtime is great. In 30-45 minutes a full fledged battle is over, and you can switch sides for a rematch.

Need to mention the theme?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
WAY fiddly - like fiddly for its own sake fiddly. 

For all its "stop every two seconds to look up another rule or card effect" it STILL plays too fast - as in ends abruptly. Shruggingly, with a whimper. 

The Edge battles and the card combos and the area/objective control and the Death Star timer and the asymmetrical styles of play... it all felt like an overpriced gaudy Star Wars mini-golf course, with cards.  

To me it acted out as slow-motion skirmish play sidelined by the chaos of Edge Battles - which cut short before it led anywhere. 

This bled away any sense of moving towards something during the gameplay - a sense of narrative, long-term engine building, etc. - and it made us feel like we were pushing buttons and throwing switches on a varied set of mechanics. Which for a SW license is not the desired result. 

NB: I did not advance to the deckbuilding stage, but the beginner plays with preset decks didn't inspire me to do so at all. I posted one official play of this but have played several games in total.

Based on theme and gameplay and if I *have* to choose an LCG to long-term invest in, I am opting for Android: Netrunner. Not to compare the two - okay, why don't I compare them - Netrunner does a tighter, better job with marrying the abstract aspect of any CCG/LCG with the theme and mechanics of what each player is doing - visually, spatially on the table. 

I'm not even bothered by the "but R2D2 could NEVER beat a Star Destroyer" theme outrage. My "theme" is based on how the abstract gameplay melds with what the actual mechanics and spatial/visual layout of each game entails. With Warhammer Invasion that is strong. With Netrunner that is strong. With Magic and even Dominion that's even strong. 

Here it's non-existent. Hence it feels pasted on and arbitrary. 

Having a universe that isn't licensed and ubiquitous in the pop culture may help. In that too many people frontload what Star Wars means to them or how they imagine it. So maybe this game is too dry and doesn't match what I celebrate the SW universe for at all.

Eric Lang's designs sometimes seem to me to be more mathy than theme. Loads of complaints about this game lacking 'theme' because of ground troops taking on ships. That isn't unthematic to me. What reduces the theme is how much each turn is actually an exercise in math. Call of Cthulhu and Game of Thrones Card Game are like that and from what I have read, so is Warhammer: Invasion.

Give me Nate French's designs over Eric Lang's any day :)

RATING: 6
A pretty good implementation of the license. The art is great, and the game features the characters, ships, and locations of the classic trilogy (none of that prequel crap). The rebel side feels suitably desperate, and the empire is powerful yet vulnerable under the right circumstance. The game is kept quick and tension kept high by a Death Star-shaped turn counter that moves inexorably forward. When it gets to the end, time's up for the rebels. 

The force is represented in a useful, if abstract, way. If the force is with the empire, the doom counter moves twice per turn. Meanwhile if the force is with the rebels, they'll do extra damage to the empire's targets every turn. The struggle for force supremacy is a separate mechanic, and you'll have to decide how many units you can afford to commit to mastering the force, taking them away from the main fight. Pretty clever.

In all, I liked this far more than I expected, though I do have some concerns regarding balance. It seems at first glance like the empire may have a little too much advantage. But that's just an early impression.

Watched the demo, saw the cards and this game is definitely not for me. Tokens, tokens, and more tokens everywhere.  Dry and repetitive.  Lacks theme.  Generic. 

Played a few times to try the game and it did not grow on me.  Too chaotic with the hand refresh.  Edge battles are too important for their random character.

RATING: 10
After just 2 plays with the preconstructed Jedi deck in the core set, I've found this game pretty unbalanced to the point where it was no fun at all for me as the light side player. I know this could be corrected if I did my own deckbuilding, but so far I'm not convinced that it's worth the investment in more expansions.

That said, I think the mechanics are unique and the theme is great. I really really want to like it, but the imbalance in that beginner deck is so unfun. 

UPDATED OPINION: 

So, like the Star Wars addict that I am, I bought into this game (despite my lukewarm first impressions) on a binge following the recent release of a Force Awakens trailer. I got all of the deluxe expansions and most of the Hoth Cycle. With a more balanced card pool, I was able to build a Jedi Deck that works much better. It faced off against my friend's Imperial Navy deck, and performed wonderfully. 

So now that I've played with a deck that felt like it had a fair chance from the start, I think I can give a better review of the mechanics of the system. I had a lot of fun, and I have to say I think this is the most complex card game I've played. 

The Edge Battle- I was skeptical of this after just playing the Core set. But with the new Jedi deck that I played with, the edge battle mechanic made sense. Knowing when to invest heavily in an edge battle versus when to play conservatively is something developed with experience and possible only if you know your deck. 

Combat- Combat in this game is unique. Units are always doing damage (unless they have no non-edge enabled damage), and the damage is permanent. So attrition feels high, and the game plays quickly. 

Resource Management- This might be the best, most strategic part of this game. My Jedi deck was designed to shuffle around resources and expand my resource pool dynamically.

In short, this game is tough to like at first. It's a complex system with more decisions to make than many other card games. Worse, the decisions that you have to make are always, in part, based on experience. So it's hard for a new player to appreciate the strategy (you have to know your deck). And, by a major misstep on FFG's part, the Core set does not put the game's best face forward, since it offers very imbalanced decks. The rulebook could have been clearer too. 

Those flaws in mind, I now really like this game. I'm definitely on a tailspin to buying all of the expansions, and I'm excited to introduce new players in the waves following the Force Awakens. The Artwork is incredible, the decisions are complex, and the time investment is reasonable. I hope more people find ways to play this game with decent decks. It's really great.

SECOND UPDATED OPINION: 11/21/2015
The mechanics of this game are just so beautiful. The only reason this isn't a 10 is the card pool size and the fact that some affiliations are simply more viable than others. FFG seems well on its way to addressing those issues, so I look forward to bumping this up to a 10 once the Smuggler and Scum affiliations get a power boost.

THIRD UPDATED OPINION: 2/21/2016
Officially bumping this to a 10 (from a 9.5, which was bumped I think from a 7). I've logged 31 plays since buying the expansions in November. It's a very complex game that has an uncomfortably steep learning curve, but once you've mastered the mechanics your strategic options are limitless. My new Sith deck (with brand new 2016 cards) was destroyed yesterday by a deck with a 2011 core Leia Organa card, and it was completely my fault (made bad decisions). That's the sign of a good game I think. I sure hope more people give this one a chance, and I hope FFG releases a new Force Awakens Core Set to revitalize the game. If you were turned off by the Core Set experience of this game, you really should give it another try with some of the expansions.

RATING: 8
A Living Card Game (LCG) based in the Star Wars universe. Featuring four playable factions (Rebel Alliance and Jedi for the Rebels, and Imperial Navy and Sith for the Empire), the core set provides two basic decks each for the Rebels and the Empire. Although there is limited customization available in the core set, it provides a very solid introduction to the game, while giving the player a taste of what the LCG has to offer. 

With a moderate learning curve, it will take a few playthroughs to understand all the elements of gameplay, but the game flows nicely once players are familiar with the concepts. 

Games are fairly quick and compelling, rarely lasting more than 45 minutes. Edge battles are particularly intense, and can swing the momentum of a game in seconds, while introducing a pretty innovative bluffing mechanic. Expansions further allow for added customization and replayability, without falling into the money pit that often plagues other CCG's. 

Often overlooked for the myriad of other LCG's currently available, Star Wars provides an amazing gameplay experience, and should not be overlooked - especially by fans of the genre. 

For the truly committed, two sets of the core are recommended to optimize deck building capabilities, allowing a player to double up on some of the more powerful pods. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
For a game set in the Star Wars universe, the only thing Star Wars-y about it is the art and the win conditions. Some of the cards capture the theme, but the overall game doesn't. When your rulebook has to explain the thematic relevance of half of the steps of a turn, you've missed the mark.

The game also turns on one of the worst mechanisms in the game - the Edge battle. It's completely athematic - it's a blind bid for the highest value - not particularly fun, and almost single-handedly determines the outcome of the battle.

RATING: 8
Somewhat chaotic and lucky/random but still very much game to master. Before playing I worried about the Star Destroyer vs. Yoda stuff but it havn't bothered me during play. Fast, fun game with many really strong cards so you can almost never be entirely sure of victory/loss.

Great LCG that is definitely under appreciated.  The deck-building pod system is fantastic.  The slightly asymmetric nature of the game also means that you will never have mirror match-ups.  Between edge battles and a multitude of card effects, games can be crazy and hard to track at times.

Love, love, love this game. It's tense and tactical and has loads of dramatic moments in each game. 

Although in some ways it's rather abstracted, for me the theme comes through very well. I especially like how the Force permeates the entire design, manifesting its influence differently in different phases of a turn.

The core set is playable, but as with any LCG the depth is introduced with the expansions. The scope of the design space that there is for the designers to explore is phenomenal, and the new objective sets continue to take it in fascinating new directions.

Eric Lang's name seems so hot right now, but this one almost never gets mentioned. It's an incredible achievement.

My rating: (out of five)
Strategy: 4
Luck factor: 3
Players interaction: High Active
Play/Wait Ratio: Since you may draw many cards each turn, it can sometimes slow down gameplay. 
Replayability: 3 without expansions.

PROS:
* you start with at least 4 resources to use. unlike other games of that type, you don't need to put much focus on resources.
* building decks is quick since you're adding sets of cards. I guess most players would rather pick specific cards and give up on other, but I think this method give more balance and also focus the gaming on the actual play and not on the deck building.

CONS:
* I still didn't figure out the right strategy for the LS to win [3 out of 3 wins for DS so far]
* Without any expansion, you can only have one deck at a time, and change it just a bit. kinda shorten the lifetime of the core-set alone.

RATING: 6.5
This game is not that bad, in fact it can be fun and some rounds can be played one after another when you are in the mood, but it has some flaws. The biggest issue, for me, is that the game is not thematic at all. Yes, there are some things that make sense and it is funny to attack with Darth Vader and defend with Luke, yes, amazing, but, because every unit can be defended by every other unit, it does not make sense. At all. How is it possible that a storm trooper can be used to stop an Mon Calamari cruiser? And, like that, many other absurd combinations may happen.
Another issue, but usually has more to do with the type of game, is the fact that it all depends on how has the better starting hand.
On the bright side, I do like the initiative bid before every combat, how critical wining the initiative is. It happens that you have to sacrifice an amazing card, Yoda for instance, because you need to win the initiative, all your strategy may be dependent on you wining that fight. I love that multiple using of the cards.
What I usually do, is play against one friend (it could be a foe, but let's say a friend), and just play rounds between different decks. After the 6 decks have been played (3 games), which it may take between 90 and 120 minutes, we usually change to another game.
Positive:
1. Artwork
2. The benefits of every card are the same, a great card on table will be a great card for initiative bid and for controlling the force
3. It is fun to play
Negative:
1. Highly dependent on the initial hand
2. Some decks may not be that competitive
3. Not thematic
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Not so brilliant as Lord of the Rings LCG, but still very solid, dynamic and fun.

I'm not fond of deck-building so I applaud with all my heart the designer's choice to include 'objective sets' (fixed 6 cards) instead of individual cards when constructing the deck.

There is too much luck in a single coreset so you should buy the 2nd one and/or the expansions if you aim at competitive play.

EDIT: FUN game!! :)

Edit - Well finally played this the other day, and it was pretty much just what I expected, except for one thing, it was a little more fun than I expected. Who was I kidding anyway, I am sucker for card games, and for Star Wars, how was I going to resist that force....

The fun likely comes from some of the chaotic cards, which I normally would not like, and it floored me at first (especially the one that negates the whole edge battle, jeepers) but I think I adjusted to them by the end, and it seemed the luck balanced out in the end which was important and as I say, the trade off besides the luck factor did seem to be fun. (Some of these cards could be removed if they really bothered someone) 

The theme really is not fully realized here, a shame for sure, but the game did feel "just" different enough from the other 100 card games I own surprisingly, so I think I will pick it up in the end. I think I liked it a touch more than LOTR-TCG, but we'll see when I get a 2nd play in, and a 3rd of LOTR, still a little early, I think LOTR does feel a little more mechanical for whatever reason.  

--------------
So far, it sounds like they messed up one of the coolest themes of all time, which would be a criminal and disappointing

Edit - "The fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance of the next turn"  Hah, if only it "felt" that way, the "force" (theme) looks weak in this one, like LOTR-TCG the mechanics look like the "stronger force" at work here.  Watched the FFG video, game looks alright but definitely not great to me anyway. Owning many other similar games I'm not sure there is a spot for it in my collection, not to mention I own the old Decipher CCG, and don't want to get sucked into FFG's 20 expansion a year plan. Likely to be the same rating I gave LOTR-TCG

Take this witha grain of sand...After one play I thought this was overly complex, not terribly so, but too much to make this easily excessible to many people. Also, I didn't find it all that fun and the theme didn't shine through and I'd hoped it would.  Hopefully with more plays the game will show me it's true worth and I'll retract my statements.

Disappointed. In this game, any two entities (say, a Jawa and a TIE Fighter) can fight head-on, and the Edge Battle system just seems like something extra to worry about for complexity's sake. Tried to like it but I just don't.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game is a true success. Many of its perceived "flaws" are in fact strengths once you get used to them and keep an open mind. The relatively important role randomness plays in the game, especially in Edge battles, is what makes it so exciting. The combat is unpredictable, and the result are often surprising or even shocking, which greatly heightens the tension. However it never gets "brainless" and you really have to make the best of your hand each turn!

On the infamous lack of theme: there is a certain abstractness in the proceedings you have to get past to enjoy the theme, but the fact that you can use all units against any others works very well to create a more open environment, with less repetition and, I feel, a good balance between the different types of units. The biggest success in the theme department (apart from the outstanding artwork) is the feel of the game. It's fast, it's fun, it's thrilling. The heroes feel kickass and the villains feel scary. It DOES manage to get the experience and feeling of Star Wars and turning it into a card game.

Apart from a few videogames, it's my favorite Star Wars related thing since 1999, and it made me enthusiastic for the saga again!

Initial Rating: 5.0 (April 2013)

I have to say that I expected more from this game. It is a mediocre, great looking game. 

On the good side, the art is great, so far the best aspect of the game (and redeeming factor). The game components are adequate and I also like the new deck building mechanic (by objectives). The Death Star timer is cool and it effectively limits the amount of time the game can take. You have some hard decisions regarding how many units attack and how many cards to send to the edge battle.

On the bad side, I didn’t feel the theme at all when I was playing this :(, also it is weird (and disappointing) when a character unit can bring down a vehicle SPACE unit (like an X-Wing) singlehandedly. I also felt the game was very repetitive each turn and there are so many tokens! So far I have only played twice with the Jedi and Sith decks, in these games the Sith seemed to be much more powerful than the Jedi deck :( so I think the game have balance issues as well :( :( :( :cry:.

As I love Star Wars so much I’m very disappointed with the game, especially the incongruous theme in the battles :cry:.

I really wanted to like this :cry:. For now I’m on the fence on this one, it seemed like a great game so I will give it more opportunities to woe me, but I don’t have high hopes for it nor I will buy any expansions for it. I will play with the rest of the starting deck to decide if I sell it or not.

Current Rating: 5.0

I still hate the incongruous theme :angry:, however last time I played the game was tense and I had fun. So far I have only played with the starter Jedi and Sith Decks. It seems the Sith deck is much more powerful, especially the card Force Lightning. That card alone can bring down Yoda :(. Yoda can be powerful with enhancements but he dies so easily. :angry:. Much more difficult to win with the Jedi deck. 

Both sides plays very similar so I don’t feel like I’m playing in an asymmetric way. 

I will play with more decks to see if this game is good or not. For now I’m upgrading its rating to a 6.0

I`ve continued to have fun with this game, I have decided to back it up so I already ordered all the available expansions :D. 

The Imperial Navy has a couple of very powerful cards. Moff Tarkin and Defense protocol are pretty powerful, also it is neat if you can play a Devastator although it is very expensive. I will play with the Rebel Alliance next time. 

I’m liking this game more and more, it is miles below Android: Netrunner but still a good game. The problem is that I feel this game doesn’t take advantage of its great theme, this could have any other theme and still be a good game and that is a shame as I love Star Wars. I hope the expansions fix this somehow.

I’m upgrading its rating again, this time to a 7.0. What can I say, I’m enjoying my plays of this and I already got all the expansions. I still think the game has thematic issues but it is a good game after all :whistle:. I don’t think the game will rise higher in my ratings.

I hate that I cannot build the decks I want because the objective needed are not available x 2 in the core game :angry:, I don’t want to buy another core game to get the missing objectives. This is by far the only negative I´ve encountered with the LCG modality. 

For now I want to delve in the deckbuilding aspect of the game, I want to play next with the Smugglers and the Villany and Scum of the galaxy :D.

I’m enjoying my plays of Star Wars, I will begin to build my decks later today. I want to play with the villany and the smugglers.

I still like Star Wars LCG, but it’s been a long time since I last played it. The reason is that it is a lifestyle game (as all are LCGs and Mage Wars), meaning it takes a lot of time and effort to play this game. I’m already committed to Android: Netrunner and Mage Wars, so keeping up with this one as well has proven beyond me (besides I also have Call of Cthulhu and Warhammer: Invasion). I’m still buying all content for the game but I’m not sure if I will ever play it :cry:. It is madness but I don’t think I can’t stop buying the Force packs now. Perhaps I will play it in the future.

I wasn't very impressed with my first plays of Warhammer Invasion or Call of Cthulhu (same designer), so I didn't hold out much hope for this game.  I was also concerned about some of the thematic leaps in the game that I heard about.

I've muddled my way thru some pretty bad rule books but this is quite possibly the worst I have come across. Nothing is given any context as to why you are doing anything in the game.  Phases in play seem blurred.

Stupid me, reading the 32 page rule book was my first mistake, especially when there is a leaflet kind of recommending you watch the tutorial video on the FFG website.  Which actually gives you an idea of how the game is played and believe it or not there is a half decent game hidden in there with lots of levels of play.

It is still disappointing that FFG continue to release 1/2 a game within the LCG structure, forcing you to purchase more.  There isn't enough in the base game for a full deck and 1 faction for each side only receives a sample objective.

RATING: 7
As for the game play, Star Wars TCG is pretty cool. Players have three "objectives" showing that the other player is trying to disrupt and destroy. An "objective" is simply a card that has an amount of health and grants resources, with some of them also granting a special bonus. Players attack their opponents' objectives, assigning attacking and defending units. I would not describe this as a multi-use card game, but there is an intriguing 3-level battle system that forces you to think about how to deploy your cards that almost makes it feel multi-use. After units are assigned, players can play cards from their hand for the "edge battle", which represents the pre-battle maneuvering to get, you know it, the edge! Some card icons are only active if you've won the edge and you also get to attack first. After the edge battle is decided and objectives are attacked, the 3rd level of battle is for controlling the force. You can assign up to three deployed units to influence the force, which makes them weaker for attacking objectives, but the side that controls the force gets distinct advantages.

No card stands alone. Every objective comes as a set with 5 command cards, which are a mix of units, events, enhancements and fate. So in building your deck, you are looking at assembling card sets, not single cards. In order to manage this, you need to keep those objective sets together and here is where my trepidation with the design rests. While I think the idea is cool, in reality I'm finding the time and energy cost of set management to be pretty burdensome. I know I just need to let it go and let my son have at it, but I'm not going to enjoy building decks if I have to hunt and search hundreds of cards to find the missing card in a set. This is a game only for the hyper-organized among us.

Most terrible experience I've ever had with a game. It's like a bunch of fanboys of both Magic CCG and the Star Wars Universe got together to create some Frankenstein's monster. I can't say enough to keep people from wasting their money on this box. I hate CCGs anyway --a sinkhole for your hard earned cash.

Rule book is very long and poorly organized. The card set number text is too small to read. Took us 45 minutes just to sort the cards and prepare. We got through about half the rule book at about the hour mark and gave up. How many freaking rules are there anyway?!

If there is a good game in here, the cost for entry is too high! I could name 300 games that are better use of your spare time.

Well... it is probably a fine game but I've been shown it by an experienced player with a better deck who kept paralyzing my forces by placing all these exhaustion markers on it and sloooowly killing by objectives, so it was a looooong and boooooring (I got nothing to do cause all my units were inactive) game. I rather won't sit to the game again, but again - it's not a proper opinion.

[2015.Jan.2] I've played this numerous times now and still want to try my hand at it again-and-again. In my opinion, this particular LCG continues to have the easiest deck construction mechanism that I have encountered in all my years of playing various CCGs and LCGs. Bravo to Eric Lang for this!

[2014.Jun.14] Solid LCG game. As a card game it suffers from the usual ups-and-downs encountered during play (i.e., "Argh! I still haven't drawn one of the cards I need.").

[2013.May.31] (Tentative rating after 8 plays.)

I have to face it. The days are over. Sadly there weren't enought people to play with. I had to give it up. It is and always will be one of the best cards games ever. It's overlooked by so many people because of the extremely good competition (Netrunner, Magic..). The edge battles are so fuckin good! Man.. I wish this mechanism would be implemented in some other games as well.

Played twice, 2p.  VERY disappointed, but I can't quite put my finger on why.  There were times when the game felt very lopsided, and other times with more parity but just plodded along.  I think I'll need to play again to really cement my opinion.  One big issue I had, though, was; you can't do ANYTHING unless you have units on the field, and there were plenty of times when I had no units or piddly little nothing units that could not really hold their own.  I've played enough CCGs to realize that this game may not shine until you make your own deck.  I was using the premades, so that could be the entire problem.

Very thematic with good solid gameplay.  My only reservations about this game is the deck-building part.  Owning most of the expansions makes the possibilities endless and a bit overwhelming.  Plus, putting it away after playing and storage is a bit of a pain.

Other than managing it all from a physical perspective, I really enjoy playing this game.

I ended up REALLY liking this game. From reading the rules, it seemed like it was going to be clunky and disjointed, but it actually flows together pretty well, and presents some great moments. (Caveat: many hands have worked hard to make me just not care about Star Wars as a property much, so the fact that Banthas can punch Tie Bombers or whatever doesn't bug me in the slightest.) I bought this as a gamble and after only one play I am pretty sure that gamble has paid off. I wrote about it [url=http://www.daveexmachina.com/wordpress/?p=7350]here[/url].

This is a really great game. It gives an excellent feel for the Star Wars universe. Te cards in the core set are very well balanced and every game I have played except one, has come down to the last turn.
I was initially going to be a little sceptical over the art work, as I had all of the CCG game, with photos, but having got the sets and all the expansions, I now really prefer the art work on this game. 
Production values are superb and adaptability is excellent, especially with the expansion decks.
One of the best card games out there, and very worthy of using the Star Wars name.

Comment entered on November 16, 2012:

I received a copy of this for pre-registering for the FFG World Championship Tournament. At this point I have only played six games and I have a very particular rating format (which is why as of today it has a 4.95 rating). The more I play a game the higher the rating will go and at this point I still want to play this game some more.

RATING: 8
Easily the weakest LCG out of the gate yet. It's a good thing that FF does an amazing job of expanding their systems, developing them, and honing them to a razor sharp edge.

There's a TON of potential here, it's just a shame that more of it wasn't in the box to begin with.

Update:

RATING: 7
Type: 2 player competitive customizable card game with asymmetrical play

Best With: 2
Weight: Medium
Duration: 30-90 minutes
Notes:
Can use base decks, but best with someone who will be interested in customizing decks on their own time, including at least some expansions.
Entirely card-based with plenty of text and effects on those cards.
Does require knowing opponent's cards decently well for best enjoyment.
Probably requires an enjoyment of the Star Wars universe.
Luck based on card draws.
Math gets really difficult later in the game while crunching numbers on numerous possible choices

Excellent card game that I really love to play. The artwork and theme are realized excellently, though you really should get smaller tokens so you can enjoy the art while you play; the default tokes are large and take up lots of room when placed on cards.

Building decks with this LCG is a bit friendlier than other games where you pick each card individually. In this, you get to pick amongst groups of 6 cards that always go together, so you have less choices, but also have to weigh how much you want the good cards since you may also need to bring along some bad ones. Also, the game does a great job of keeping every card relevant, even if you already have a copy of a unique character on the board, by incorporating the "edge battle" mechanic. This also adds a huge amount of tactical depth turn by turn, as it matters how many cards you have in your hand when it's not even your turn.

Also, this game does a good job of reducing the problem with many similar card games where you draw one card on your turn, and for multiple turns just cannot pull the cards you need to overcome your opponent. In this game, you draw and play cards at a high pace, so you usually get 4-6 new cards each turn, and every card has some dual-use purpose either as a card to play directly or to spend in an edge battle. In MTG or Android:Netrunner, those games can sometimes be decided by poor draws for a few turns, and there's nothing you can do about it.

One downside unique to this game is the amount of math that can be involved later in the game as more units are on the board. The permutations and variables can become paralyzing as even high level players can sit for 5-10 minutes agonizing over one play. This actually costs this game 1 full point for me in the ratings, but only because that is agonizing at times, either to be waiting on someone else or be the one trying to figure out the best course of action. (That said, it does attest to the depth of play, and even when you know what your cards are, the gambler's luck you still play with when you make a complicated attack sequence.)

Other downsides are inherent in the LCG format. Your gaming group members need to spend time before the gaming session to customize their decks and keep up with everyone else in the game group with purchasing expansions. If anyone lags behind, they will be at a marked disadvantage. In addition, many of the better decks that synergize well and really start to show their character and style can only be achieved by diving deep into the expansion packs. For instance, only 4 of the 6 factions are viable for play in the core set; the other two requiring at least the first deluxe expansion, but realistically all requiring at least some of the various smaller force pack expansions to really start to mesh together strategically.

That said, this game is excellent to play, nicely balanced, and really a must-try for any boardgamer/card gamer who likes Star Wars and has similar-minded players in their game group or local gaming shop.

Similar games in my collection: Android: Netrunner (LCG customizable card game, asymmetric 1-on-1 competition), Magic: The Gathering (cusomizable card game, 1-on-1 competition), Lord of the Rings LCG (scratches the same LCG style customizable card game itch)

A great LCG game. Some of the best artwork I have seen for any game, and for anything Star Wars related, for that matter. Stopped playing due to my lack of competitiveness these days, and with the game expanding fast, it became more and more competitive. Extremely thematic and immersive.

Couple of solo ! Test plays. Similarly to android: Netrunner, this is quite convoluted and requires some time to grasp the full mechanism and flow of the game. Lots of referencing back to the manual. The Covenant video http://www.boardgamegeek.com/video/24209/star-wars-the-card-game/team-covenants-star-wars-lcg-tutorial-faq on this I found excellent. The FFG only ok.

Played this with real opponent and it was far too complicated for them to grasp what was going onset alone enjoy it. I still think this is good , but you need to concentrate as there is a lot that is easy to miss. We played a load of things wrong and missed a load too"

I am just not the demographic for this game. I am not a Star Wars fan and feel the whole franchise is a bit hokey. I have not yet found a LCG that was able to grip me.

This one feels pretty much like the other FFG LCGs you'll find though the mechanics are not the same.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Theme simply splashed onto a card game mechanic.  How exactly does a rancor fight a star destroyer?  This is one where an entirely different system was needed; perhaps a multiple arena of battle (land, space, politics) system?  Regardless, the excitement of the theme and the great idea of deck building with sets of cards rather than individual cards cannot out weight the terrible and nonsensical main mechanics.

Can't believe I fell for another LCG. Where do I begin? Too complicated and too many card interactions that require both players to be totally immersed in the game and commit to memorizing all of the card interactions. Not a game for casual gamers. What a mess trying to teach this game to a new player, and when you're done, all you're really doing is moving tokens around to different cards hoping to exceed their strength limit. Zzzzzzz.

Explaining card and hand management is extremely painful because cards can be used in so many different ways. I know for some people this is part of the game's charm, but for me it causes major analysis paralysis.

Too many phases, for crying out loud; Force phase, force struggle phase, conflict phase, edge battle phase... the flowchart for a player's turn looks like the blueprint for the deathstar... but more confusing.

Focus tokens are tactics tokens, but tactics aren't to be confused with focus tokens... oh no, that would be illogical. Good luck explaining this one to anybody.

What the flip is an edge battle, anyway? I defy you to explain the purpose behind this little bluffing game to a new player. Makes no sense no matter how you try to candy coat the reason behind it. 

I do think the objective based deck building idea is great, and I hope they use it in another game. In the end I think this game overreached and tried to be too many things... and fun wasn't one of them.  

Man, did I want to like this game. On the bright side, the artwork is absolutely stunning. A clunky, funky hot mess of a game.

Takes several plays and builds to get into. I see this getting better the more of it you consume, you need multiple copies to pull off the central idea or "thematic" decks you will build. It has definitely found its place and a way to stand out among Magic and Netrunner.

Love Star Wars. Detest CCG's (thanks MtG). Dislike LCG's. Hoping FFG isn't going to bombard the market with excessive amounts of expansions. My crystal ball says I'm going to be disappointed.

Initial impression of the game was very good. After repeated plays, that impression has held up. Card art is superb. Mechanics, while a bit difficult to grasp initially, are very well thought out. Implementing theme is done very well. I really felt the Star Wars essence oozing out of this game.

Just clean fun. Plays a LOT faster than you might think...but at the same time you can slow things down if you have the right pods in your deck. Options will grow with more packs/cycles.

I really do like the way deckbuilding is handled in this game, while I feel like I have less control of it, I think this is perceived. It makes slapping together decks fast and fun with minimal brainburn...that said you need to start analyzing what pods offer if you want to do well.

A LCG that you can build a deck fast get out there and start having fun. What is not to love about that? IMO 2 core sets is needed if you want to really customize a deck. Although as more expansions come out this will fix that. But I think you do need more then just a core set if you are going to play this allot. But great game over all. And the artwork is amazing I give it a 10 in this area.

This being an LCG keeps it from being an 8+, but it is a great game. The issues are the requirement to buy more game, and spend time configuring decks. I just don't have the interest when there are SO MANY standalone card games that are spectacular.  However, it is hard to imagine Netrunner being better than this, though I haven't played. Much talk is made of its asynchronous sides, but this game has that too, and I've heard complaints that Netrunner relies too much on the bluffing/guessing aspect, so that brilliant play can be doomed from the start. In any case, I do very much like this game, but not enough to pursue it. I'll play with Tim, when the situation arises.

A fun game & i love the theme.  I like the deck building mechanic as it allows me to change the deck around fairly quickly.  I just don't have time to spend hours trying to come up with the perfect combo.  

It's not the greatest game of all time, but a very good game & a lot of fun.  Looking forward to some expansions.

Solid dueling card game in the same vein as Magic: The Gathering. It has grown on me after a few plays and I find the card play to be much more interesting than what you get in MTG.

Fun and interesting 2p duel game with lots to think about and fun deck-construction.
Like all other LCGs it's still hypocritical in that you need to get multiple copies of the core game in order to build great decks from the start.

[b][COLOR=#009900]Positives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]+[/b]  Star Wars, Star Wars, Star Wars!  Man, this game is just bonkers cool with the Star Wars setting.  It's got all your favorite characters, ships, locations, one-liners.  It just oozes the Star Wars universe all over your game table.  It's the highlight of the game for me.  While I cleaned up the last session I played, I just flipped through the cards of the decks one by one, just enjoying its Star Warsiness.  The art is fantastic.  Great stuff.

[b]+[/b]  The gameplay is quick and fun.  Turns move along at a nice clip with the back and forth cardplay.  It's fun to look for those combos you get with these types of games, ways to manipulate the board state, and bring yourself out of hole into the win column.

[b]+[/b]  There is only one rulebook, and it was fairly easy to comprehend.  I did watch a couple of videos as well, but after one reading, I was playing the game.  I find the new FFG dual-rulebook method very hit or miss.  It was nice to get one of their games with a "normal" set of rules again.

[b]+[/b]  Oh, and....STAR WARS!!!

[b][COLOR=#CC0000]Negatives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]-[/b]  This is [b]not[/b] a solo game.  To play the game the way it is intended, there is just too much hidden information, bluffing, and card reactions for it to do justice as a solo game [i]which represents the game's design[/i].  Now, that doesn't mean I haven't had fun.  But you are missing out on what makes this game interesting as a mulitplayer game by forcing it into a solo setting.

[b]-[/b]  Man, I can't stand the LCG model of games.  You buy the Core box and literally, get half a game in there.  Yes, it is playable.  But if you want to play the game as intended...i.e. construct decks...you must purchase two Core sets.  And you know what?  That's still only two-thirds of the game!!  If you want to play all six factions, you'll need two copies of Edge of Darkness as well.  Grr.  Just annoys me to no end.

[b]-[/b]  Deck construction.  I went into this with a positive attitude and actually excited to give it go.  One of the main reasons I sent LotR LCG packing was because of needing to construct decks.  Here, I love what they did with the concept...cards are put into sets of six, so if you want one card in that set, you take all six for your deck.  This really lessens the need to hem and haw over every single, individual card and should quicken the process.  However, when I sat down with the stacks of cards in front of me to make some decks, I was just turned off by it.  So, I just grabbed the few sets with the "big name" characters in them, doubled them up, and filled in the other two or four sets to create a full deck with whatever looked good.  I just wasn't interested when it came down to it.

[b][COLOR=#0000FF]Neutrals[/COLOR][/b]
[b]~[/b]  In the positives section, I specifically mentioned the Star Wars [i]setting[/i].  The [i]theme[/i] on the other hand, may bother some folks.  To me, it's like most card games.  The theme is more of a feeling than a true account of the actions being presented on the table.  Is Obi-Wan actually fighting the Devastator with just his mind tricks?  Uhhhh....no; sorry.  It's not really a concern for me, but the game can be more about numbers than about theme at times...just like most games I play. 

[b]~[/b]  I wanted to put this into the positives, but based on my first negative comment above, it didn't feel right to do so.  However, let me say up front...Thank you Jay K for your [filepage=94291]solo variant[/filepage]!  Seriously, you did a fantastic job with it.  It's well organized.  Well thought out.  Extensive in its scope and inclusion of new material being created.  Truly one of the better fan made variants out there on the Geek.  Kudos to you!  But...as I stated above, because of the nature of the game, you just have to cut some of the good stuff out to get it into a solo playable format.   And because of that, you don't always play the game the "right" way.  You play it against the variant rules.  This can both create tense, exciting moments, as well as not so challenging victories.  It's just the nature of the beast.

[b]~[/b]  While I enjoy the quick cardplay in this game, I know some folks don't.  Cards will not last long in this game so don't get attached to them.  There isn't quite as much long-term planning here as with other, similar games I play.  You'll go through your hand of cards almost every turn...and you need to.  Cards played in front of you, generally, won't stay there very long.  Once I caught onto the fact you want to get through your deck quickly to find the "big" cards and combos, I find that style of play here enjoyable.

To summarize:  If this were [b]any[/b] theme/IP other than Star Wars, I would have put it up for trade already.  But that's what is drawing me in and giving me enjoyment.

GREAT GAME!
I have been playing WOW TCG and Magic a bit for the past few years and this game is completely different and more fast paced than any of them. I love that the cards are always useful for something (unit, event, edge battle, etc).
I also love the bluffing aspect of the battles.

RATING: 5.75
a decent treatment of the license, but out of the box, the game feels pretty incomplete.  LotR and Warhammer: Invasion have been the best efforts out of the box for the LCG model, but after a couple of games, the SW set needs some help quickly.  I guess Hoth is on the horizon and I hope it can delivery.

Props to the old Decipher system.  Their system up to Hoth had a great feel and a very good design tying your deck to your 'life'.

EDIT: Living card games are tough to maintain without dropping continuous cash. Still a fun game but does not see the table nearly as much (a few times a year now compared to several times a week in the past). It has slipped out of my top 3, but still a good game with great art on the cards.

I own this game and most of the card decks. Although it is sometimes difficult to find players in my local area, I find this game to be both strategic in card thinking and deck design, and tactical in the flow of the game between turns. The asymmetric nature of the win conditions are interesting and the idea of building "mini games" - the edge battle and force struggle - do work within the game's concept. I do find theme and story here (something that is often a criticism of the game), though the story is "epic" and wide spanning, as opposed to individuals and small team stories in other game systems.

Got a chance to demo this game at GenCon 2012.  Love the theme, but I'm not quite sure about the player vs. player implementation. I've also played FFG's Warhammer: Invasion and Android: Netrunner LCGs, and much prefer their implementation of player vs. player card play.

This game also has some unique and interesting game play mechanics.  I'm just not sure how well they sit with me.

I thought this would be an insta-buy for me.  But now it's just a "think about it" game.

A very good LCG.Fun mechanics, but obi-wan facing a star destroyer in battle still makes no sense to me.

RATING: 7
In this 2 player card game, one chooses a faction on their side, such as Sith or Imperial Navy if they play the Dark Side. 

Players construct their deck by choosing objective cards. Each objective card has 5 cards that come with it. The light side wins by destroying three of the Dark Side objectives, while the Dark Side wins by advancing the Dark Side timer to 12. Each turn, there is a force battle to determine who controls the force which affects how fast the timer moves. 

In engagements, there is a side "edge" battle to determines who gets an advantage in the main engagement. 

The cards generate resources, are units, vehicles or enhancements. 

It's a fun game, and I'm eager to play more hands.

I love this game! I'm a big fan of Star Wars and was waiting a lot from it. I was not disappointed. Strategies, tactics, hand managment and bluff. All is here. On my first plays, I thought dark side and light side were not balanced. It's not the case. The strategies are different according to the faction you play. You just have to find them. The artwork is faithful to the world of the films. Theme is well respected. You already have a lot of plays with just the base game. Expansions is not necessary to play it occasionnally.

This had to be great for me to switch from Invasion and it just wasn't. I can't get past the fact that a person fights against a space ship.

I like it. I think I like it. I'm not sure I can play it very well. But I think I like it.

Initial thoughts are that it's very tough to win with the Jedi against the Sith. But, like all these things, a bit of familiarity with the decks is a pre-requisite. The big question is: am I going to play it enough to get that familiarity?

A decent themed CCG type of game which really tries to mix things up for once with the way deck building is handled, as well as edge battles.  Combat is no longer static and predictable as with most CCG games, but you have an element of gambling in which the edge battles can completely turn around a battle that seemed one sided.  This keeps every battle feeling fresh once everyone knows what they are doing.  Game also plays quick with the whole balance of the force giving an overall push to the game at all times instead of letting games drag out.

The deck building is also very unique and is going to be something players will either hate or love.  It's going to take getting used too but I really dig it.  Forcing players to take objective sets stops players from easily min maxing all the cards in the game.  As with every ccg, you always have cards players deem worthless and will avoid for the meta.  With this deck building system, players will at times have to take some less "awesome" cards in order to get that special uber card.  No more cherry picking your deck, but having to think more about theme and the risk/rewards.  No more breaking each card down to a game science and causing huge chunks of every set to be left in a box.  Game has a bright future and off to a good start.

100+ games. For someone who enjoys playing effect-based games but isn't fussed about the solitary process of deck-building, this game's mode of deck construction suits me down to the ground. You can have a fun game just picking out 10 random or semi-random pods, or picking pods based on a theme, or with a crafted deck where you're trying to gain synergies but have to handle the good with the bad. It turns out to be a fast paced game once you're used to the effects - games can go anywhere between 2 and 6 rounds, rarely more. The big decisions each turn are what cards to deploy given the state of the game (remembering that you want to keep cards back for the edge battles this round), what attacks you want to execute (remembering that you may want to keep units back for defense and for the all important force struggle) and also how to go about the bluffing in the oft-important edge battles for first strike. Each of the factions have a different feel so exploring these provide plenty of replay. The game-play's only going to get richer, and the rating higher, as the expansions come.

Great game. Great theme. Really like how the theme was integrated and the balance of the force is a really cool aspect of the game. Love that they skipped the film stills and actually drew the complete illustrations. Enables artists to come up with new characters and events, etc. Great work. Will add a few more sets soon to explore a little bit more.

Good one FFG. I will be purchasing one new force pack each month. Will be interesting to browse cards and come up with decks ideas.

I also find that the theme in this game is much better integrated than in the Lord of the Rings LCG. This will be more difficult for me to play though since it is a 2-player game whilst LotR can be played solo, so will probably see more play than this one which is a shame...

Another living card game where you will have to buy an endless amount of expansions. Nothing really new here, the cards are nice and they always try to change up some mechanics to differentiate themselves, but really just a way to get people to buy cards for the rest of their lives. After a few plays the game makes you decide whether to attack or save your units to defend, the plays are short, but not really fun. Surely the expansions will bring more to the game as well as a deck building aspect, but the base game leaves much to be desired.

Have decided to trade away or sell. Have explore the games first several waves, and three or four deluxe packages. A ton of fun. However, will not likely ever find a dedicated opponent again.

Sold entire collection for about $100. Included a few promos. I probably had about $250 into it. That means I netted about $3/play. Not too bad.

Truly an excellent game, however needa a dedicated partner and a large number of plays to unlock its beauty. Many games are like this of course.

One of the better gaming experiences I've had, alas, all good things come to an end.

LCG. Don't buy this! Competitive LCG; I prefer the co-op LCGs. The mechanics are not that good compared to more modern LCGs (Arkham) because the mechanics and theme don't always match. The deck building part isn't good. The game is dead as of January 2018.

Fantastic, tense game.  Each side has it own unique feel, and there is a balance between the battlefield, committing to the force, and keeping a reserve in hand for the edge battles.  

Really needs a weekly play group support to meet its potential, though I'm looking forward to the 3 vs. 1 mode in the next expansion.

Nice duelling card game with one of my favourite themes. The edge battles provide bluffing and outguessing fun. All card abilities and special powers are nicely tied to what or who the card represents. I´m playing it just casually.

Rating downgraded from 8->5.  The more I play Game Of Thrones The Card Game, the more I realize how much luck is in Star Wars.  Not the fun kind of luck.  Frustrating, time wasting luck.  I see how the designers tried to mitigate luck through card discard/draw and not having characters perma-die, but the objective sets (pods) model kills any way to plan for and mitigate luck.  Need more resources?  Too bad, even if you put in higher value resource pods you might not draw those objectives or have worthwhile characters for your game plan in those resource value pods.  I feel like the pods are playing me as the pod system seriously restricts creativity.  Pods might seem like a great idea to simplify things, but the pod system is terrible for a card game and seems like it was implemented to A. Make the game easier for people new to card games (those who might be drawn via Star Wars theme) and B. to seem different than the plot system in Game Of Thrones and not cut profits from that cow.  The problem is, once you play enough Star Wars, you won't be a card game newbie anymore and will eventually want more deck building control.  Sure you could also argue the Force Battles mitigate luck somewhat by being able to out bluff your opponent despite the odds (which is also very thematic!), however, I don't feel satisfied that this balances the use of the pod mechanics.  Meaning, Star Wars never makes me feel in total control of my actions like I do in Thrones. Card games already have some luck involved outside of one's meta, I don't need more luck thrown in by having my resources and play-style dictated though random objective draw. Tedious.  Boring. But gets 5 stars for artwork -- so pretty!   Please excuse me, I'm off to play more Thrones...

3rd LCG I've played (after Lord of the Rings and Android: Netrunner). They all - for me - have the same problem: complex ruleset with some easy to forget little rules, unclear situations when you play certain cards and only enjoyable if you have a gaming partner who is willing to play with you this game time after time.

If I'm rating this game a 7, it's more because I see the potential this game has if you play this a lot with an evenly skilled player, rather then I'm expressing the willingness to play this.

What a mess of a game...
It steals a lot from other games - I find similarities with other LCGs, mostly Call of Cthulhu LCG. The E. Lang's style is easily recognizable: cold and mathematic with very poor theme.
The deckbuilding aspect is original, perfect for casual players I'd say.

Mechanics are strange and a bit overcomplex for what the game is: on one side the game forces you to calculate lot of things in a useless, clunky way, while on the other side I see a large amount of luck involved during the Edge phase, a so crucial phase that simply should not be so lucky dependant. I like the luck factor in games, but the combination of the two aspects above sounds very contradictory and the result is weird and often unbalanced.

All in all, the game is too cold for my tastes, but most of all NOT FUN to play. Worst buy of 2013 for me.

The only very good thing I see here is the artwork, one of the best I've seen among LCGs.

I have the base set and Edge of Darkness both in 2x, plus the Hoth cycle. I also have the Balance of the Force expansion set (see my comment there) but the game ends here for me, I will not buy anything else.

Star Wars - one of the best sci-fi movies ever, at least for me.
When I heard that SW LCG was coming out I was really excited. At first it was supposed to be co-op game, later 
they redesigned it into a competitive game.

Unfortunatley it didn't quite hit the spot for some people in our group so I can't play it as much as I would want to.
Luckily, there is multiplayer expansion coming out soon which is always a plus for me/us.

All in all, it is still a great game.

First off, I absolutely love the deckbuilding mechanic. Instead of individual cards, you chose a small set of 5 to add to your deck, and the associated objective to its own deck. It both cuts down on a lot of niggling on deckbuilding and introduces some interesting decisions. You could include another copy of a sweet card, but you have to decide if the other 4 that come with it are also worth being in your deck. The best-case scenario is that you can't just put in all the best cards possible in the maximum quantities, the worst-case scenario is that you'll do it anyway and have a bunch of dead draws in your deck that you have to suffer through. Thankfully, objective sets are created to where they at least work well with each other, even if not all the cards in the set are, *ahem*, good.

I feel like the game is just too clunky in actual gameplay, though. I think it would have been better served if it wasn't an asymmetrical system. It feels like the whole light vs. dark thing was just added for flavor purposes rather than because it actually made the game better.

Oh well. If you're a diehard Star Wars fan, this will probably appeal to you a lot more than if not.

This is an interesting game, but I feel like the theme carries it. To illustrate this, everyone that I've played it with that either hasn't seen any of the Star Wars movies (my wife) and people I know who don't really care about Star Wars (every single other person I've played it with) haven't liked it. But I do, so there's that I guess.

I love Star Wars. Almost as much as I love card games. So naturally, I'm attracted to Star Wars LCG by Fantasy Flight Games.
It has a multitude of interesting mechanics, and has depth and strategy to it. 
It has the casual gamer as well as the hardcore, money spending, gamer in mind with the whole LCG thing.
The base set, for 50 - 60 bucks, contains quite a few decks in it that are actually good at easing you into the game. Everything is very simple and yet when you throw in Edge battles, the game ultimately changes.
I wish it supported more than two players, but apparently one of the expansions may do just that.

This game has a lot of mechanics and a lot going on. At first you may think the game is a mess of mechanics but once you play 2-3 times you realize that it is just one of the better card games on the market.

A worthy addition to the Living Card Game genre. Borrowed some tried and tested mechanics from other deck building games but managed to improve on them. For example, the use of focus tokens instead of "tapping" a card when it gets used, is brilliant in the way that it gets rid of the usual constraint for an automatic reset of the card at the start of the next turn. Another example: the trade-off of playing down your units, while still maintaining a decent hand-size for the edge battles, is another nice touch.

I really like this game after a few plays. It's flavorful, thematic and it has a whole new way of deckbuilding. I'll have to try it a few times more; until now I only tried a Sith vs Jedi battle. 

The core set alone is a little meh though. I bought Edge of Darkness as well to give me all the faction-options. 

Upd: After a couple more plays the abstract use of the theme brings this game down a bit for me. It's a nice game, but it's more like symbols/effects with a Star Wars picture plastered on. Art is still top-notch, but the game is not one of my favorites.

I own two core sets (plus a full playset of everything else) to maximize deck-building possibilities.

This is my favourite game. I am so passionate about it. If I could be a game evangelist for only one game, this would be it. It is the best card game I have ever played and one of the best games I have ever played, period.

I love the way deck-building works. It's the most innovative thing to happen to competitive card gaming in years. I also love the fact that every card matters. There are no useless cards, because even if you don't want to play them normally, you can always use them in an edge battle.

It's a very tactical game. Every move you make matters a lot. I love that. It's very unforgiving, and it takes a lot of practice to play well.

Overall, an incredible achievement in game design.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Another great entry in the LCG lineup from FFG.

I looove the deckbuilding in this one with cards grouped into objective sets. It really changes the way you approach deckbuilding, I think.

Gameplay is solid. I like the resource system, the combat resolution, it's all good.

Edit: it pained me to do so, but I finally traded this off. It's a cool and fun system but my group just can't play ALL the card games. Right now, it's Netrunner and we'll be checking out the L5R relaunch. I'm more than willing to rebuy this, though, if we ever play it consistently.

My first introduction to LCGs. Playing at a casual level and enjoy the deckbuilding in making fun, thematic decks. I like the asymmetric nature of the two sides, and because one box has cards for both players. The theme is awesome, and the art is sensational. It's Star Wars, how can it not be awesome?

When rating the Star Wars card game my feelings are very conflicted. The Star Wars card game is a great card game, with questionable deck build rules, and the mechanics don't match Star Wars. To be honest that is what bugs me most about this game... Had they made this game without the Star Wars theme it would be fine... But as it is I go into this game expecting it to FEEL like Star Wars and there is where it falls short. It's a great game and a great license, but those two things aren't meshed well. Other than that the game's only major flaw is in deckbuilding. I think that having to build decks with "sets" or "pods" as some people refer to them as is silly. It makes it easier for newer players, but I like the freedom of building my deck exactly how I want. And that dings it down a peg for me. Overall not a bad game, just a weird mess up on FFG's part in my opinion.

RATING: 6
I've found this to be quite a swingy game, with the advantage going to the first person to find and play their named character. I think this may be a function of the modular deck building rules, which makes it very difficult to add counters to particular strategies without weakening your deck.

Really enjoying this so far. I like the tension of the Dark Side countdown to victory and the way combat works. I also love the 'pod' method of customizing decks with sets of 6 cards that go together.

The score set combined with the Edge of Darkness expansion gives me 6 full decks (one of each faction) of 10 cards. Since I will be mostly playing this casually for now I think that's a perfect start to getting into this game.

Beautiful artwork, and some interesting ideas are marred by what is actually a rather boring, non-inspiring game design. Works well enough, but nothing that really screams excitement, or more importantly, Star Wars. Quite frankly, you could substitute artwork from any other genre, change some of the terms used, and voila... have yourself the same game. Not a bad design, but certainly not what I would have wanted for such an important license.

RATING: N/A
Thanks god this is not going to be a co-op clone of LOTR. 

And reading the rules it looks more like a Magic clone...with bells and whistles. The bells are the force battle which either speeds the click to a dark side victory or allows the rebels to bash the bad guys objectives. Seems to be a lot if card cycling (an empty deck is a loser) and a mini battle phase for the edge - a sort of enhanced first strike. Only play will tell if this works, my fear is that it not either different enough from MTG or thematically well tied in enough to shine. I hope I'm wrong.

RATING: 10
Have been playing this with my 10-year old son and we really love the deck-building mechanic using objective sets instead of individual cards - makes it very easy to try a different deck every game. It does take a few plays before the theme comes through (and you understand how the cards interact with each other), but once it does, the theme is actually pretty good. Two core sets is essential once you start deck-building, as the most important objective sets are in the core and you'll want to have the maximum (2) of them in your deck, otherwise your most powerful units can get stuck at the bottom and you'll have no chance.

Overall, better than I expected it to be. Not nearly as complex or meta as Netrunner, but that just goes with the theme.

Looks complicated, but is amazingly smooth and intuitive once you've got a game under your belt. Can have incongruous match-ups, but design is more about putting you front and center in struggle between light and dark over control of the galaxy - its cinematic and thematic scope, not really about individual head-to-head engagements. Players can tie up the loose ends.  Thankfully game play with focus on taking out objectives, the Death Star dial ticking down, the edge battles, the force struggle, the 4-star artwork, flavor text, and generally logical card abilities facilitates filling in those thematic blanks, if you must.

My rating is an 8 for now, but this could go either way depending on future plays. I think the game is a good one.

Well it's Star Wars and it has great art.
The deck building is interesting.

Thats the good points

The edge battles do nothing for me.  I get that they are important, but most the time it is annoying interuption in game flow as people ponder what to put in.

And no, it doesn't feel very Star Wars-y

edit:  I still don't know what to think about it.  I watch vids of it on youtube and I want it.  But then i see how it constantly seems to be one side gets ahead and stays there and generally hate that sort of thing.  Want it a little more each time.

RATING: 5
Fast game, outcome frequently hangs in the balance to the very end.  Every action has greater consequences than may be noticed at first glance; very little room for errors in play.

Some will complain and underrate this game based on breaks in theme.  I beg to differ.  This is a slightly more abstract game in terms of unit interaction, and I feel it works better as a game that way.  A little imagination though turns the player into a storyteller; his epic unfolding before him on the game table.

The rules at release leave a lot to be desired.  They seem disjointed and incomplete in many aspects.

*update* ...and so Fantasy Flight decided with their first rules update to scrap logic and clear up rules questions via arbitrary declarations instead.  Downgraded rating.

FFG feel as though they've been churning out the LCGs lately and I wonder if Star Wars is the least developed of them.

Committing characters to the force is almost as dull as questing in LoTR. At least here you still have the opportunity to use the character.

I've only used the base decks (and at that, only the Jedi and the Imperial Navy starter decks) but they didn't create an interesting game or generate enough interesting decisions for me. It also appears that FFG still haven't found a satisfactory way to address the land screw issue with Magic that continued in aGoT. 10% of the cards in the Imperial Navy deck give additional resources but that just leaves the game down to luck of the draw.

If, with all the cards they have planned, they cannot generate 2 starter decks that make for an interesting game, I'm not interested in exploring this further.

LCG for beginners. You can`t change one card to make your deck better. You always must change a whole objective set (6 cards).

The edge battle is something new. The players who wins this battle strikes first and can use edge abilities. You must choose if you want to play a card in an edge battle or save the card and play it in a common way.

The entire line Fantasy Flight "Living Card Games" is pretty solid, and Star Wars: The Card Game is no exception. The mechanics fit pretty well with the theme, and I like that this generally plays quickly while having some nice depth. On its own, I'd probably rate this higher than a 6, but I think for me it suffers a bit in the inevitable comparison with some of the other LCG's in series. To my mind, the Lord of Rings, Warhammer Invasion and Cthulhu games are all a bit better (whether in depth or ease of play).

I am pleasantly suprised by this one.  It has a feeling much closer to Deciphers CCG than I had expected.  True, Vader's Tie killed Yoda, but it didnt matter because the combos and suprises felt so satisfying (especially when the Rancor ate Yoda, after he returned from the dead)

For me, the best LCG yet and my personal #1 game of all time.
:star: It's Star Wars!
:star: Edge battles are a great idea - no card will ever be truly dead for you
:star: The Force struggle, as another layer on top of conflicts, really changes the flow of the game greatly
:star: The three different combat icons are a way better way to differentiate units than a fixed strength number
:star: I love drawing up to my hand size every turn - it feels like it greatly reduces the luck of the draw
:star: Objective set deckbuilding is the best thing to ever happen to customizable games - it looks like it'd make deckbuilding quicker, and I guess it does, but the main thing is that it gives you knowledge of your opponent's deck without relying on metagame knowledge
:star: Focus tokens instead of a binary state ready-exhausted are also a really great idea, especially with resource-generating cards

Of course, even in the #1 game it can't all be sunshine and rainbows.
:nostar: Some counter-intuitive rulings have been given to resolve some situations
:nostar: The game has taken a long time to reach a balanced state (the dark side was powerful in the beginning, then it was smugglers, then jedi, and now it seems to be somewhat balanced)
:nostar: The designers are slightly overeager to use a restricted list to solve overpowered combos

Some negative reviews of this game initially prevented me from trying it. It's been fun so far. This is a much smoother design than Decipher's, but at times the mechanics feel very "gamey", rather than cinematic. Matchups like Rancor vs. Home One or Yoda vs. Devastator are jarring. It is hard to picture what a unit is doing when it's "committed to the force". And it feels odd to attack my opponent's Objectives - it feels like the Mission cards should take that role instead. But, the game design is still solid and allows for direct interaction of all units, which was a problem in the Decipher game. The pod system leaves me with mixed feelings. The LCG distribution model, however, is awesome.

Good game. Mechanics are smooth once internalized. Not perfectly thematic for Star Wars (see Star Wars: CCG), but is a decent abstraction. I see some similarities in mechanics from the CCG - edge battle = battle destiny, force struggle = force drain, objectives = locations.

Unfortunately, the deck building mechanic is going to leave a lot of unused cards, especially as the designers have gotten themselves into a power creep hole. Some may argue this is just the designers better understanding the game, however. The mass number of "restrictions" required in the 2nd and 3rd cycles show a lack of playtesting.

Pros 

- Scoring criteria (objectives) not mixed into the deck (unlike Netrunner)

- Asymmetrical without being programmatically so (again, unlike Netrunner)


Cons

- Often anti-thematic (I'm going to give Vader's lightsaber to this AT-AT, which will then engage this rebel capital ship)

- Deckbuilding is very constricted by design - you build in five card sets rather than choosing each card that goes in your deck.

Good game with lots of comboroom in the cards. Also art is good and the game is very thematic, characters work exactly the way I would expect them to. The worst weakness is that it is hard to grasp the timing during the first game, when can you play interrupts and when can you play actions, reactions and other types. This resulted in the first games being a bit hard and limits the recruiting of new players, especially those unfamiliar to other FFG LCGs. After the rules are mastered which for me happened at about 5 plays, the game gets a lot better. Next thing is to start deck-building.

Love this game. I did stop buying the packs a year ago because I had to drive some distance to ever get a game in. But if I found someone in my neighborhood who played then boy I'd be back in business throwing down as often as possible.

It's a very complex card game with a huge number of expansions and force packs, but the cards here create decks that play casually well enough and there are enough options to keep things interesting for a while with just this core set.

Innovative deck construction combined with Star Wars (always a good thing), LCG (always a good thing), FFG (always a good thing), and Team Covenant (always a good thing). Natural 10.

The interaction between players works well and plenty of strategy to think about.  Looking forward to more plays, I think my rating will go up.

Unfortunately, it is likely that I will never play this game again.  I was so excited for this when first announced and was sad when creation of the game got pushed back a full year.  When I was finally able to play, after much anticipation, I got 2 core sets and several expansions to have enough of a card pool to make it interesting.  After several plays (about 10) with fellow Star Wars fans (both of whom played and enjoyed the old Decipher SW:CCG with me years ago) none of us could understand why we should continue to play.  

I don't know a better way to describe it other than to say it felt like the game played itself.  It felt like there were rarely decisions that needed to be made because it was always so obvious what needed to be done.  I was sad to finally admit it, but I really didn't like the game.  I ended up trading away all of my stuff.

Definitely try it before you buy it, but keep in mind that you should know in 1 play if you will like the game or not (IMHO).  I know the game is more complex than that and it takes longer than that to fully comprehend it, but I knew I liked chess the first time I tried it as a 6-year old.  I'm still enjoying it and learning more about it almost 30 years later...but I loved it from the very first moment I played.  If you don't like this game on the 1st play, don't waste your time waiting for the "aha" moment.

Overall I've found it less satisfying than LotR for now - and that's no surpise since SW is competitive and less story-based. 

Currently thinking how to win as LS. Did that just once in our last 8 games with my son.

-- UPDATE

Got 2nd core set and 1st two expansion packs. Immediately built thematic and (probably) strong-combo Jedi deck. We'll see how it goes...

A fun card game.  I love that its not "collectible" but stopped buying expansion decks.  For a "non-collectible" card game there sure seems like a LOT of expansions to collect. 

Ten-thousand times better than the old Decipher Star Wars card game.  That game just wasn't "fun."  This is a good card game.  Gets an 8 because its a good game and because it is Star Wars.  Its no Doomtown, but a very good card game.

Lots of borrowed mechanics from other successful games. While they mesh together somewhat well, overall the game lacks that magical something that makes CCGs/LCGs successful. It's okay to kill sometime while waiting for the others to arrive for a proper gaming session, but it's not worth devoting your time seriously.

Game has improved considerably with expansion packs, increasing the rating

I love the innovative deck building method found here, as most CCG/LCGs have a high learning curve for creating your own decks. The idea of just picking a couple objectives and having your deck assemble itself is quite ingenious. It makes building decks on the fly incredibly practical, which should keep the game fresh for those groups playing out of single collection.

The game itself I found a little weird, with all the character vs. starship combat and all that, but it's not a deal breaker. I can handle the abstractions. I'm not sure I liked the blind bidding Force system, but I might come around to it. Bluffing is my favorite part of Netrunner, so I suppose this shouldn't be any different, once I get used to it.

Love the theory of the card groups, but deckbuilding is still tedious. And it uses a hoary resolution system. But some cool things as well, particularly edge battles, so I want to explore it.

Off all the LCG around this one was highest on my wishlist because I knew my wife would be interested as well, thanks to the Star Wars universe and our mutual TCG past. And I just love it! Tactical, huge replayability and a very interesting gamemechanic! If my wife is convinced, this will see a lot more play!

I tried this out after really enjoying (but not fully diving into) Android: Netrunner, figuring I should give FFG's other LCGs a shot. I certainly liked the artwork in the game, but the gameplay left me a little disappointed. The edge battles in particular provided me with a hard decision: do I want to win this edge battle or do I want to have cards in case my opponent starts an edge battle? More and more, the game left me disappointed with my options, almost like playing a harder version of Agricola where you're constantly worried about begging cards with every single action you take. Netrunner definitely does not have that feeling, which is why I've sold Star Wars and heavily invested in Netrunner.

Two player LCG between the light and dark side of the force.  I love games that explore asymmetric play as this one does. As you would expect the cards represent the characters and scenes from the movies. Cool deck building mechanic. Pick from a selection of objective or location cards each of which having a matching set of cards and that's it. The Death Star countdown timer is a great way to prompt rebel action. I also like the resource system using focus tokens and the continual force struggle.

The Star Wars LCG has some interesting things going for it, but I'm not sinking money into another slow-grind release schedule when I barely have time for Netrunner, the Lord of the Rings LCG, and Magic the Gathering - all of which are better games.

So, unless you're an indiscriminate fan of all things Star Wars, you're better off sticking with Original Trilogy Risk, Clone Wars Risk, or Clash of the Lightsabres.  They're a one-time outlay of money, and they're all worth playing.

I love Eric Lang. I really like Star Wars. I have an LCG problem. How could I NOT love this game? Asymmetrical play, especially in card games, is a real draw for me. Here it's done very well. The Dark Side is trying to hold out for the Death Star to fire while the Light Side is trying to destroy three of the Dark Side's objective cards. And in the middle of it all, the forces of the Empire and Rebellion are fighting each other in the middle, both by physical means and through the force.

I can see how it's weird that players can pit destroyer droids against huge ships, but despite that weirdness the game really captures the Star Wars theme for me. Seeing some of my favorite characters from the movies laying the smack-down on others simply delights me, but that's really just a bonus. The edge battles provide a nice alternate usage of cards and it's simply agonizing to decide whether you want to commit a strong character that you can't play yet to an edge battle or hold on to it to play later. Many games come down to the wire with the Rebels desperately trying to finish off objectives while the Empire goes all out on trying to hold on for a couple more turns. This may not be the my favorite LCG, but it made a solid spot on my 2016 Top 50 Games list (at #47) with its excellent asymmetric play.

While not as unique, thematically or innovative as Netrunner, this game scratches the itch for a SW themed game.
The game does away with or diminishes some problems that cardgames suffer or elements that I don't like : weak cards not getting any use, auto include of overpowered cards, resources coming to slow or too fast…
Tactically there are a lot of decisions to be made during a round. In fact while it looks like an easy cardgame, it is hard since making a mistake can spell your doom. I also like the focus element that shuts down a unit without killing it. 
The deck building with groups of cards is innovative, easy and yet interesting since you'll need to compare groups of cards with each other. 
I don’t know yet how I feel about the edge battle mechanism. One part it feels random, for another part there seems to be a bluffing minigame. The edge battle does balance playing big units or lots of cheap ones at once against saving cards in your hand.
I like how matches can swing at anytime. Dominant positions are not a given and that's a good thing, since it does away with boring one way games. 
The state of a game changes fast because you refill your hand on the fly. This provides exciting matches until the end but also makes it more difficult to read what your opponent will do. The deck and draw directs your strategy, yet the game is not autoplay because of the many tactical decisions that are to be made. 
The mechanisms don't seem to mirror the theme, which has arguments and counterarguments. But I think we have all been spoiled by great examples (lotr, netrunner, agot) that pulled it off. However card abilities themselves makes the main characters feel like they are in the SW universe.

I avoided this game for quite a while, as I wasn't overly interested in the theme and didn't want to invest in a card game that I wasn't sure I'd play very often.  But, then a gaming friend of mine picked it up, so I bought a copy as well, and, let me tell you, this game has been a pleasant hit!  There are plenty of difficult decisions, and, with the ticking timer that is the Death Star dial, every decision matters.

2 Copies of the Core Set.

They finally made only 2 Core Sets required for a playset (although the deluxe expansion will still require that you buy 2 for a set, which is a setback IMO).

Dale of Merchants really is a mixed bag, at least for me. It sure is a solid game mechanically but the fun is not there. Actually it was quite annoying at times since the decisions were either no-brainers or you really were not given a choice. I also found the deck building aspect surprisingly non-existent which reduces the game to a tactical level seize the moment excercise with very shallow strategy elements. 

When it comes to fun, I found very little of it from trying to get hands worth of 1-2-3-... and finally 8. This climb takes place too fast for you to execute any meaningful strategy on the distribution of cards in your deck. And the actions/effects on the cards were from the generic/dull end of the spectrum for players to pull off any surprising combos that take you off the guard.

You can see that the game is strongly inspired by Dominion and after that it is a question of personal taste which one you prefer. Maybe I am being harsh here with my "low" rating since the game is not broken and I can see why some people might like it. For me however, Dale of Merchants offered very little fun or situations where I felt like my choices really made a difference.

As a game, it's enjoyable. The deck building element is nice, as you have to focus on building up and simultaneously tearing down. My biggest complaint is with the artwork - it's fantastic... but I opened the box and was disappointed to see that there was only one of each race; you weren't getting multiple fantastic lizards or whatever. Small complaint.

I do enjoy this game as a more Euro-y deck builder. The card combinations offer a sort of middle-ground between Dominion- and Ascension-style information. I do feel constricted when I play, and not in a way I necessarily enjoy.

Consider this another entry the growing line of small deck builders along with Valley of the Kings and Xenon Profiteer (perhaps also Star/Cthulhu Realms, but that in it own category). Unlike those games, this has a more modular set up, where the main deck is composed of smaller mini-decks around certain mechanical theme (e.g. manipulating the market, discarding cards, taking cards from people's hands, etc.), reproducing some of the variable set up of the bigger original deck builders. The end game condition is also a little wonky, completing increasing number of sets of cards with the same type and number, but it does further set itself apart from the typical VP games of the genre.

I'll always have a soft spot for deck builders. I'm not sure why. I just like the engine building component of a deck builder. It's fun to fine tune it and end up with a well oiled machine that lets me trample the opposition by late game.

There are a few things I don't like in deck builders. I don't like having very little control over my hand, such as when the game forces me to discard everything and draw back up a fresh hand every turn. I also don't like it when a deck builder doesn't give some good options for culling junk or cards I no longer need.

Dale of Merchants does not suffer from either of these issues. You can hold on to as many cards between hands as you want. And in just my first play, I found at least three distinct ways to get rid of junk cards early and late game.

The theme and artwork are excellent and pleasant to look at. The overall card design is easy to read and decipher. The gameplay allows for plenty of worth while options. I always felt like I had plenty of control of both my deck and the cards in my hand. The atmosphere is very laid back, in that if you don't include the raccoon deck, you don't really need to worry a lot about "take that" moves if you don't want to. Of course, if that's how you want to play, you can include the decks that support those sort of actions. That is another great thing about this game, you can customize the experience based on the decks you choose to include. To top it off, the scoring system is super simple. There is no counting points. It is a race to build 8 stalls. First person there wins the game.

Overall, this is a great deck builder. I thought Flip City was going to be my go to game for a portable deck builder, but I have to say that I actually like Dale of Merchants quite a bit more. I highly recommend it.

Interesting deckbuilder, now this is actually evolved version from the basic Dominion-style deckbuilders, not just copy with another theme. Lots of combo possibilities and replayability ensured by the expansion. And one important thing: a very well done flavor text, it doesn't interfere with game information, but is very rich if you want to read it. This have a full franchise built around the fluff.

Dale of Merchants is kind of deceptive: it looks like a harmless a light game whereas actually it’s pretty demanding, since there is so much that can be done with it.

It’s your typical deck builder with endless combos that can be made and exploited, each of which pretty rewarding and satisfying on its own: but to make them happen you have to optimize everything, over and over.

Hence, Dale of Merchants is one of those games: dry games where you can’t chit-chat with the other players as you’re too busy planning your next turn and managing your hand of cards requires all your attention.
And I’m not too fond of this genre at all: playing means socialization, not bookkeeping.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
As far as deck builders go, this won't go near replacing Dominion. Too luck dependent, and no room for real plans as cards come and go. 

For more details; See my comments on Dale of Merchants 2. Cute animals, nice artwork and an attempt of a fresh take on deck building. I don't think the theme blends well with the gameplay, but that's a minor quibble.

Very enjoyable deck building game as it's not about getting super combos so much as getting the right cards in your hand at the right time.  First play resulted in me losing the game by only one turn because I didn't draw the card I needed to make teh final winning play.  Also the art and variety of animalfolk you can choose from means this game will have lots of replayability for me.

Después de unas primeras partidas un poco decepcionantes, las siguientes han ido mejorando y se presentan más combos de cartas para optimizar el proceso. Es divertido el punto ese de decidir dejar de comprar para empezar para montar el tenderete tan rápido como sea posible. Solo lo he probado a dos por ahora, y las sensaciones son buenas (aunque creo que para dos sigo prefiriendo Star Realms).

I really enjoyed this game with a couple of caveats.  Some of the animals (looking at you crocodiles (DoM2) and Raccoons are a bit "take that" and I my girlfriend doesn't really care for that type of gameplay.  I explained to her it is similar to the Draw 4 in Uno.  Of course in this game you can consciously choose to add cards to your deck that force more player interaction whereas in Uno you are forced to take cards due to random draws and not actively selecting and purchasing "take that cards". You can always choose to play without those animals.  I also like the fact that you can mix and match different sets of animals to significantly change the game play.  Very cool.  Although, I played with each set of 3 that I selected during a 2 player game 4 times each, I often felt that by the time I got some animal abilities up and running good (like the raccoons) the game was over as someone built their last stall/stack.  This might be a product of me not really using the animal synergy and this will come with time.  Sometimes I felt like the game ended too quickly and wished it was to 10 stacks/stalls.  Still a very quick game and once you are familiar with the animal abilities the game really hums along and does't over stay its welcome.

A neat deckbuilding game where you use a subset of all the decks in each game each with a different thematic set of powers. Your deck stays very lean throughout the game as you are trashing junk cards and spending cards to build your stalls (path to victory). On your turn you take 1 of 4 actions (buy a card, use a card for its action, build a stall, or discard cards). There are a couple neat twists with this as the cards you buy go direct into your hand and these cards that let you alter the rules also serve as your path to victory so you have to give up some of these powers in order to win. These 2 rules give the game an interesting decision space as you can easily combo a couple turns together. Definitely one to recommend.

Unusual deck builder as you are building and "deconstructing" your deck. Thus there are very few cards in your deck.
A race to the finish (build 8th market stall). You have to decide when to stop buying cards and focus on the building of market stalls.

A great deckbuilder with fun gameplay and artwork. Only flaw is that there aren't enough decks to choose during initial setup; a problem solved by the upcoming release of Dale of Merchants 2. :-)

I was excited about this game. So much so I bought Dale of Merchants 2 at the same time. The idea of a family-friendly slightly simplified Dominion was very attractive. 

Sadly this game is just dull. The set stacking mechanism means you really need to memorise what colours and values are in your deck to know what to buy. And the actions are wordy and not interesting.

A big disappointment.

:star::star:

This might easily be my favorite deck builder after [b]Dominion[/b]. It's quick to setup, quick to play and it is brilliantly modifiable when combined with expansion (which is necessary for higher replay ability). Factions are completely asymmetrical, like in [b]Star Realms[/b] but it does not play on autopilot because players are always challenged with a hard decision: should a valuable card be played for it's action, or for purchasing another card or for placing into a stall stack from which point that card cannot be used anymore. With different combination of animal factions you get completely different play styles and the art is beautiful and cute. Raccoons are especially wicked and evil and should be used when you want more conflict and "take that" mechanisms.

[b]Update:[/b] Rating lowered from 7.89 to 759 due to some unbalanced card combinations that lower replay value and thematic experience.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Thematically and mechanically diverse beautifully connected factions which can be mixed and matched for lots of specific play styles.

Excellent deck builder with the added mechanic of a deck breaker.  You must build up your deck in order to accumulate the necessary cards to then break that deck in order to accomplish the end game condition of building your stall.  Many types of animal decks with their own special mini-mechanics allows for a high replay value. Have played 10 times with varying numbers and haven't had a bad review. Have number 2 and cannot wait to try it out.

What a fantastic, tight, quick game! Makes some nice twists on the deck-building genre. Really nice tension between buying cards to improve your deck, and using cards to build your stalls. You have to know exactly what's in your deck, and manage your hand and discards to get the right combination of cards into your hand. The artwork looks great and it plays quickly.

Way too much text to read on every single card. Every deck has cards that contain a large paragraph of text that make you read the equivalent of a small pamphlet whenever its your turn. If you don't bother to read all this text on other players turns you end up not knowing what they are doing or how to react to it.

There is a deck of card that adds randomness without providing any level of fun.

Dale of Merchants is a fun little set collection/race game disguised as a deck builder. Everything is straight-forward and engaging, and turn go quickly. My only complaint is the amount of text and specificity on the cards does not fit with the weight and speed of the game. Dale of Merchants is quite good, but for the first handful of plays, players will need to stop the game to read each card. This causes a slowdown that feels like much more than other games because of Dale of Merchants speed and race-like feel.

Doesn't really feel like a deck builder because your deck is always extremely thin. The game doesn't involve creating an engine like usually deck builders do. Because of this the game lacks a clear arc. The early game feels pretty much the same as the late game because your deck doesn't evolve through the game. Players are constantly destroying their decks by building stacks.

I still enjoy the game because of the interesting and sometimes unexpected card interactions. The art is very good too!

RATING: 7
 Good card games that managed to caught me off guard. I wasn't expected to have so much game in such a small package. I thought these would be fillers but these can easily be main events at some nights. Wonderfully strategic gameplay, a lot of different animal factions to use and a lot of different tactics to utilize. Re-playability is high. It has a steep learning curve, because those players that have already mastered any animal decks have an advantage against those who haven't. I find very little differences between DoM 1 and DoM 2, they are basically the same game, only with the different animal factions that you can almost without limitations to mix together to form any king of decks. So these games as a whole deserve an 7/10.

A simple Ascension-style deck builder with a whimsical theme. It's a bit simplistic mechanically and doesn't really add anything new to the genre. Our games had a tendency to stall out if we didn't focus on building stacks correctly. Valley of the Kings is much better

RATING: 7.5
I really wanted to give this game an 8. It has some really great ideas and lets you combo some interesting card effects together and doesn't rely too much on the luck of the flip from the center row, since there are so many instances of few enough different cards. And the fact that there are six distinct animals all of which have a theme to their card effects, and you only use a subset of the animals in each game theoretically adds some nice variability. Unfortunately, the reason the game gets knocked down a bit is because of the six animals, I don't see myself ever wanting to play with two of them, severely limiting replayability. And for the expansion, the numbers seem as bad or worse. In particular, each set has a dice rolling faction and a take that faction, and three to four factions which allow for interesting cardplay. Maybe if I could buy a set with my custom animal choices I'd enjoy it more, but as is it feels like a bad value to only want half to two thirds of the content.

Deck builder of sorts where you're trying to lay out a tableau with 1 of a type, 2 of a type, 3 of a type (base on value of cards, not number of cards), all the way up to 8 of a type, which makes you win. The cards all have special powers that modify the rules or give you additional options. A couple of the types have take-that or randomly-screw-with-somebody's-deck mechanics, So that turned me off the game, even though the didn't come up in the first game.

This game and it's sequel manage to nail the "light, simple and fun deckbuilder" formula that many games have been trying to fill for years, and manages to meld theme to it's cards as well.

This is a racing deckbuilder. Every turn matters, you must actively seek to get good cards AND cards that give you options to build stacks. You need to start building ahead of your opponents to stay ahead most of the time and it creates tense finishes. The only thing I don't like about the game is the stealing cards thing, when a player gathers a card stealing ability you try to counter it with getting your own and guess what they also steal it because they got lucky (%20) and then because it has an additional action they steal another card and you are way behind. I still like the game quite lot and the artwork is absolutely gorgeous.

- A bit unintuitive

RATING: 6
Compact little card game, which one is not a bullseye although not the total miss either. I like the way, that all the cards are useful here and there is enough luck included as well. But the biggest issue is, that there comes quite amount of downtime when players are "making combos" with technique cards which also gives you another go. Oh, and you should avoid playing this gamw with four players, because you "get" only more downtime. So this is actually game for only 2 or (at max) 3 players. After couple of games played this is going into my trade pile... definitely not a keeper.

I was part of a demo at this year's Origins.  Like a film, I can usually tell in the first few minutes if I will like a game or not.  And like a film despite the twist and turns it may take, I've found that to be a pretty accurate statement for my game-playing and movie-watching history.  I was tuned out after two rounds and didn't find much fun in Dale of Merchants.  You have different animal card sets, but ultimately everyone is playing all the animals anyway.  Meh.  Not a game I liked.  Make it more asymmetrical and then we're talking.

This is a great game.  It strikes a good balance between strategy/tactics and the length of play thanks to the streamlined rules.  Although it's listed as a deck builder, I think it's better thought of as a double hand management game because the deck you build tends to be quite small compared to other deck builders.  The artwork is also very cute.

RATING: 8
A nice deckbuilder that's a little different from most deckbuilders as you need to get rid of the good cards as well, progressively, but  it can certainly slow down during the mid section of the game, making the game last way longer than it should, outstaying it's welcome. The attack cards can really mess up plans as well, especially when your hand gets shuffled with someone else's and your carefully crafted combos are messed up. A bit of take that isn't bad, but this just makes the game last many turns too long.

Dale of Merchants is a charming game where you aim, through the gift of deck building to set out your stall as soon as possible.

Dale of Merchants is a nasty, cut throat, take that game, where you try to set up your stall by robbing your opponents blind and giving them all the taft you don't want.

Dale of Merchants is a game of luck and strategy where you are rolling for bonuses and making clever use of deal and copy cards to extend your go as much as possible and set out your stall.

Dale of Merchants is all this and more. A wonderfully clever deck building game Dale achieves variety and depth with relatively few cards. The key comes in the various animal decks that all focus on one mechanism. The Ocelots are random and use a dice to decide thinks, the Racoons are thieves and steal others cards, the Macaws are efficient, the Pandas get good deals and so on. 

The aim of the game is always to 'set out your stall' which involves placing 8 stacks of ascending order from 1-8 value. The amount of ways this can be done is really clever.

Cards that are less powerful tend to let you chain another action on to your go, and there is also some market decisions to be had as to whether you buy that card while it's expensive or take that action you desperately need to.

Subtle changes from the usual deck building formula (when you buy cards they go into your hands for example) make this interesting to play. For a relatively small card game to have so many decisions and variety is amazing. And the sequel is on its way bring even more variety! A must have for deck building fans.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
It came out of nowhere and conquered my heart. I know that eventually it will loose its appeal due to the limited amount of cards that's in the base game, but for now I just love this one. 

It's an ingenious blend of deckbuilding and set collection, with customizable games and grazy good artwork. I like the theme as well. I also love that you don't have to play all the cards in your hand like in any deckbuilder, but you actually get to choose what to do. I love that at the beginning of the game you are concentrating on the effects of the card, in the middlegame you care about the color of the cards, and in the endgame you are just looking at the cost of the cards. It makes your focus shift, and the end is almost always escalating. 

Not in the sense that it gets faster, but in the sense that it gets more tense and it feels like a race, despite not having the pace of it. Great, great game!

[b]Dale of Merchants[/b] was traded away in a math trade 1/15/17. (Received La Isla)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6 -> 4)[/COLOR]

[i]My initial excitement wore off quickly and Dale of Merchants ended up sitting on our shelf unplayed for months until I finally traded it. I mostly played with my older daughter and she also quickly lost interest, the decision space in the game was too light to sustain repeated play. If your looking for a light introduction into deck builders this would be a great place to start; we just have too many other games that we like much more if we're looking for a 20 minute game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]- Finally; a quick, easy to set up deckbuilder.
- Plays great with two, games take maybe 15 minutes.
- Family friendly: easy to teach with a fun animal theme and art style.
- This game moves since while you're building your deck you are also using cards to build your merchant stall (first person to have 8 stalls wins). 
- A good variety of decks (6), and if it starts to feel stale they are releasing DoM 2 which adds 6 new decks.
- The different decks all change how the game will play (deck culling, take that, card manipulation are a few of the focuses).

This has been a surprise hit, but the quick set up and play time will keep this game in the rotation at my house. The game never bogs down, you are in a race right from the beginning to build your stalls as quick as possible.[/i]

This game really showed me why I'm not into deckbuilders. I can usually overlook a pasted on theme. But this just never hit the table. I kept it around to see if the partnership variant would improve the game. But it just never happened. There are simply better games out there, even better deckbuilders.

But it does have some interesting mechanisms and it does have nice artwork. Like it, but never loved it.

Had high hopes. So many positive comments from fellow bloggers and bgg friends. We played with the attack cards and it was over for me. The game lasted far too long. This is not a simple filler. Will become crazy AP with the wrong people who love to "KNOW" the cards (Dan). It is the only way you will do well if you have the knowledge of the cards. But, the turn over for the cards are so frequent that you can't plan ahead or anything. Cards will be stolen if you play with Raccoons. I was expecting something this game wasn't and had a terrible time. Don't go in expecting a fast deck building game. For me I don't know if I will revisit it. Probably works better as a 2p game anyway.

Pleasant-looking deckbuilder which has a lot of special powers to take in on a first play (25 (I think) at 4 players, to Dominion's 10). Having to maintain purchase ability while losing cards to your stalls is a nice trade-off. We had some trouble with colour differentiation, though, despite the little symbols on the cards. Almost sold on it.

Played it two more times as a 2p game and I'm enjoying it more and more. We're still only using the same starter characters (Parrots, Pandas and Squirrels) so there's still a ton of variability to explore.

This game satisfies my itch for deck building, light combos, some set collection, hand management and racing. It has a good level of tension from about the time your opponent plays her 2nd stall all the way to the end of the game. There's a wide range of interaction options depending on the animals in play.

Raising my rating to an 8.5. I can see this one going to a 9+.

(Initial impression after one 2p game)

Loved it. My first play was excellent. By their nature, most deckbuilder games make deck management an important feature of the game and the normal mechanisms for doing that are cumbersome and frustrating uses of relatively rare "trash card" abilities or, worse, the building up of a well tuned engine to improve your odds of drawing the cards you need.

With respect to cruft in your hand, DoM does two things right: 1. All of the cards count as money 2. Because the game is a race to build stalls and the stalls are built using a regular action and the building of a stall removes those cards from your deck, you are never stuck with unwanted cards in your deck. Just build a stall!

The other thing I dislike about most deck builders is the difficulty in getting cards with good synergy to show up in your hand at the same time. Games like Dominion (base game) force you to whittle down your deck, buy lots of copies or the cards you need or build an engine to get lots of extra draws. All of this just to increase the odds that the cards you want to use together will show up together. DoM doesn't make you discard your hand at the end of your turn so you can always hold onto part A of your perfect hand while you wait for part B to be drawn.

DoM removes much of the frustration of playing a "classic" deck builder and does so with fun and unique art and excellent graphic design.

Starting at a 7.5 with the expectation that this will go up in the ratings with more plays.

I'm not a fan of deck building games, nor do I like games that feature lots of special powers and combo building.

However, this game plays fast and smoothly. The special powers aren't very overwhelming (a good thing); the main game mechanics I think are more important than creating combos: Ensure that you collect the correct combinations of cards so that you're able to form groups of cards that add up to specific numbers.

Al though this appears to have a lot of replayability because players can choose a different deck of cards to play with, I don't really think so. Players choose which groups of cards are to be added to the deck, but each group of cards I think will always be played in a certain way.

Where did this game come from? Definitely out of nowhere for me. I packaged it in with another purchase and essentially got it free. After my first game I was already comparing it to the race elements of Splendor. Unlike Splendor, which I only play as a 2-Player game, Dale of Merchants plays great at all player counts. The game plays super fast, simple turn structure, great art, and offers some good decisions to make. I don't normally buy a game without a lot of research but I'm very glad I bought this one.

Too long and chaotic with four players, especially with with all the attack cards that hurt other players. There are zero cards that allow you to defend yourself, and that is a downside. There are some neat things in this game but nothing exciting really.

Only play this with 2 or 3 players.

A pleasant and non-confrontational deck builder with a race to collect sets. The theme is executed very well, with items and card abilities falling in line with the attitudes of their respective animal races. The decisions weren't always so straightforward, either, so that is a plus. Looking to try more races to explore its appeal.

Essentially a racing game and in that respect it builds up momentum beautifully as the game progresses. Lots of fun decisions along the way and variety from the different  decks. 

One year on.... this has quietly emerged as one of my most played games. The abilities in different decks continue to reveal nifty tricks and it has been positively received by everyone who has tried it.

Average deck builder.  Just focus on buying all the cards in one or two particular colors so you have the number combinations to build the stalls.  Nothing special here.

RATING: 6
a very, very light deck building game. three things save this game from (subjective) obscurity (for me): endearingly cute setting, themed decks (ala Smash Up), and the fact that it can be played over a lunch break. there's a clever tableau mechanism going on which fits nicely and allows for many of the card powers to shine. easy to teach, reasonable footprint, and expansions (if you like). it doesn't come out often, but sometimes it's just more fun to play this than roll dice (although feels similarly lucky to me).

RATING: 9
PnP copy.

This is an excellent game with a surprising amount of depth given the small number of cards.

Also, this probably fills a difficult to fill void in my collection - it will make a great travel game (we just used four dice instead of a board although I am looking forward to having the board with the nice artwork too).

I think this will take it's place alongside Onirim, Urbion, Fairy Tale and Hive Travel Edition as my airplane/vacation games.

Amazing deck builder!

Pros:
- Fast setup and cleanup
- Modular: pick what you put in for mechanics; variable setup
- Beautiful artwork
- Small table footprint
- LOTS of strategy and choices to make.
- Lots of personality and theme

Cons: None that I have found so far.

[Playtester!] This is an inspired design both mechanically and graphically. There are hard choices but the game is light enough to be fun. Because the decks are selected for each game, there are numerous ways to win. For the same reason the replay value is excellent.

RATING: 8
A clever integration of deck-building and tableau building elements that makes for a strategic, but engaging game.  Each animalfolk deck has its own particular advantage, so selecting the animals that you want can determine the gameplay styles engaged.  Fun with small to medium sized groups, and does not require huge amounts of advanced planning.  Some elements of luck, as with most card games, and strategies develop to mitigate risk.  We found that in the absence of a first player marker, we had to house-rule our own rotating mechanism, because the first person to the market has a definite advantage.

Sadly, this game does not continue to provide interest after several plays.

A very surprising game. A great gateway to deck building that seems light and very simple. This little box has tons of replayability and some depth as well. The most surprising thing about it is how different games you get based on which animalfolk you include. Each combination flavours the gameplay in a new way. I never thought that I will get that enchanted by a title that I would classify as a light filler game. Highly recommended!

small deckbuilder a la Valley of Kings - except that you are building 8 stacks in front of you, vs. a tomb.  you cannot use teh stacked cards, but the first player to make the 8th stack wins.  tom likes it a lot.   

Might be too chaotic with too many 'mess with other players' hands' cards.

Interesting UNDERDEVELOPED idea.

The cards are all too powerful and after buying a couple of cheap ones to use their powers, the other cards ore nothing but numbers you need to win the game.

If the game had two types of cards: 

- action cards you use to perform actions / buy

- goods card that can only be used to build your stall

it would work much better.

The "deck unbuilding" mechanism is one of the smartest victory systems I have seen in deckbuilders. Okay I haven't played that much of this genre but it's way way smarter than "useless VP cards". I plays remarkably well and tight with 2 players.
My animal preference list: chameleon, squirrel, panda, racoon, macaw, ocelot.

Provisional rating, two 2p plays mixing DoM and DoM2. Liked the lightness, and the variety of powers, Dissatisfied that most of the card powers seemed irrelevant to efficient play, and that the first player had a distinct advantage.

RATING: 7
Good, fast, easy to teach deckbuilder with a fresh approach to the genre. Nothing too revolutionary but it will see a lot of playtime, especially 2p and possibly 3p. Cannot see myself playing this 4p due to downtime/decisions ratio will be extremely dominated by downtime. It also suffers from a little too easily optimized strategies so for every combination of animalfolk it usually only takes 2-3 games until the game becomes formulaic and the favourite cards always get picked and win the game. Add to that that I dislike a few factions then the replayability starts suffering quite fast.

OK game, fast and simpler than it looks. The cards effects aren't complicated so you immediately understand what could be interesting for you.

I picked this game up based on Tom Vasel’s review. It looked like a nice simple deck builder of sorts, but one with player interaction, a progression curve, and some variability in the setup leading to different games. I’d say it has that, but it’s not entirely fair for me to judge the game quite yet because I botched a rule when teaching that really threw off the game: we didn’t take bonus actions with the bonus action cards, making them kinda worthless. Still, the game seemed interesting and I liked the building of stalls and the ebb and flow of your deck.

Tentatively recommended.

Deck builder card game where players represent merchants of the Dale in a race to play eight stacks of animal cards in the market. Animal cards are multi-use and can be added to a stack, played for the special ability, or used to buy more animal cards. Each anthromorph animal group provides a type of benefit during game play. Such as racoons screw your neighbor, ocelots bring random chaos, macaws provide hand management.  The tough strategy decisions are knowing when to lose a card's ability in your deck by scoring its value in the stacks you are building.

Awsome artwork, love the colors, nice card-actions with lot of flavor and easy to learn.

 But! to collect cards because of two different reasons (numbers for stall or card abilities) sounds like great fun, is actually not that much. I think there are too many cards with actions on it - it's so overwhelming in a chaotic way.

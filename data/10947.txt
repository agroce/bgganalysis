Expensive, but very pretty. With 2-4 players it is mostly a memory game, which for us quickly got tiring. With more players I'd expect the role selection mechanics to become more important instead of remembering what diamonds are where. So I still have hope for this.

I suck at memory games. So when someone went to the trouble to bring it along for a games day, I did the only thing I could think of to avoid heavy frustration: I poured myself a rather large shot of singe malt whiskey and had a blast.

Kind of cute as a family game, with lots of opportunities for things to surprisingly happen. Whoa!!! 

Nice general mechanics with the cards, but really, the nervous thrill one gets from opening a drawer and hoping for "good results" rapidly wanes after perhaps the tenth time.  However, you still have to do it ten more times with little thrill.  

Diminishing returns of enjoyment eventually lead to feelings of, please folks, let's finish this game! How do I end this thing?  There, I did it, got my last fake jewel in a drawer!  Now, can we play something else?

RATING: 3
{1 play • 5 player} Well, it's georgeous.  And it was certainly interesting (and, yes, fun) for the first half of the game... but then I just wanted to run away.  The memory aspect was too hard (you could really track only one drawer - okay, *I* could only track one drawer.  Plus, there are many better simultantious reveal your "action" card games, and it just took too long.  Mind you, it was a learning game for all of us, so maybe the next play will be shorter, but I have no interest in proving that theory.  Now, having said that, this may be the game I rate the lowest in which I still urge you to try it once, because, as I said, the first half was okay.  But with an $80+ price tag, you may not get to try it.  (If you do play it, I suggest using fewer gems per player - the game ends when 1 player gets rid of their gems).

Yikes...who knew it'd be such a yawner?  Perhaps the expectations were built too high, because I certainly found this to be a snoozefest from the first couple of cards.  Simultaneous role selection BS plus puzzle and spatial memory skills equals bullshit!  Having to open the drawers *just* so also makes it ridiculous.  The gang of people I played with also kicks down the rating, such that I'd prolly rather go for *gulp* Eclipse next time, given a choice between the two.

I was expecting a little more than I got with Master thieves. Yes, it is absolutely stunning to look at and has fantastic bits and chrome. However, the gameplay is decidedly ho-hum. I was easily able to remember where all the rubies were and handedly won my only game. The game seems to be more about second guessing what roles your opponents will play as opposed to manipulating the jewelery box.

RATING: 7
A nice puzzle game with role taking like Citadels and a large wooden puzzle box. It was impossible for me to keep track of anything, so I played randomly, which wasn't that bad. It is a lot of fun opening drawers and colecting gems and dropping gems, etc. But right now, it is unaffordable!!! A plastic version, perhaps?

I approached this one with some caution. Yes, it looks and feels fabulous but early comments sounded liike a memory game, not usually my cup of tea.
After playing it a couple of times I really like it. Yes you need to track a drawer or two (the more the better) but there is plenty of interest in the ordering of role choices and it certainly makes for a unique experience.
One warning, it can be a long game and might outlast its welcome, I suggest starting with fewer fake gems to shorten the number of rounds

RATING: 6
An engenious and clever memory/deduction game. And a fair amount of theme considering the abstract nature and unusual mechanics. The fact that there are little plastic jewels of "value" that are hidden and then rediscovered lends a curious, almost gambling-like patina to the game experience. The only real drawback is its portability and perhaps its price: it's not cheap and it's not the sort of game you can spring upon people (unless you always play your games at home). Still, a pleasing and fun gateway game.

RATING: 8
This isn't playable under all circumstances, but its certainly a great gimmick. Played with 8 players and it was a lot of fun. I'd like to get a copy of the game for my collection, but its a bit scarce. 

The memory element isn't my favorite, but the truth is that I can't remember that much detail. Mostly I just try to track where one drawer is and hope its right side up when it comes to my turn. With less players I think this would become less enjoyable and more technical (since you could actually have much more control).  But with a lot of people playing, it ends up being a very thematic, quick-moving and fun game.

RATING: 7
Trumps everything in the wooden bits department.  Yes, it's partially a memory game (so much that it's practically a luck game) but it's great fun if a little longish and I was suprised that there was more substance to it than I expected, particularly in the role selection.  There's some really fun tension in sliding the drawers out and waiting for the gems to drop out.  The box itself is genius, and is probably a better way to get non-gaming people interested in games than Settlers, TTR or anything else.  Completely unique, I'm sure it's going out of print within the hour.

RATING: 9.5
Played with 5&4. Very good enjoyable game, certainly a very unique design (it is the most unusual game device I have seen in thousands of games). Great Storage-Box, great pieces, maybe the cards are a little bit simple compared to the high production value of the other components. This is more than a simple memory game. The roles give you lots of choices and tactical possibilities. Watch the other players. As in Paternoster it pays off to track just one or two items (drawers), then you can plan your moves and reduce the luck factor. Might get a little chaotic with higher player numbers. Pass on your cards to your neighbour mechanism is similar to Zum Kuckuck.

If I were rating this purely on gameplay, it'd be a 6, but the experience of it is just awesome enough to make it an 8 - mostly with people who haven't played it before to see their reactions.

Slightly concerned that tracking/deducing rubies is a little too good (given that remembering/following one drawer is loads easier than remembering/following many, and learning about one ruby gives information about another), but it may be fine.

It is precisely that most humans can't remember where things are that this game shines.  Opening a drawer and knowing its contents with certainty would ruin it.  But trying to do that is also what makes it fun.  One of the few really great memory games, and of course it's super expensive.

Played at BGGcon 2015. 

You choose a role that determines what actions you take, then players compare cards (identical roles go in numerical order). Then you either add or remove gems from this huge, wooden box contraption, depending on what role you selected.

After your action, you can rotate different sections of the box or flip it over. Some drawers have a second compartment that only the "master thief" role can access. 

The central component is crazy and fun to play with, but I confess I wasn't very good at keeping up what drawers were where and most of my turns ended up pretty much as guesswork. Still, I recommend at least trying it out if you can find a copy in someone else's collection.

Played once with 8 players. It was extremely long for what the game gives you. I would prefer playing something else than Master Thieves if I would be playing a game for a few hours.

Characters with powers like in Citadels. Play one per turn. Play each character once, before getting character cards all back and than pass to the other players. Each character has a number to see who goes first when same character is played in the same turn.

Interesting memory game. Beautiful box and bits. Orignial. Expensive.

One of the rare breed of games with a really new idea and concept. I personally enjoyed it very much, but it is not a good game for people who dislike memory elements in games. Many are confused by the Rubik's cube mechanic of the game "board", but in fact it only is important if the cabinet is upside down or not and to remember the special wooden markings on each drawer. The different roles work well and add an interesting element to the game, and in fact the game comes very close to helping you imagine you really ARE a thief working on an ancient cabinet with hidden gems. Therefore it has to be applauded simply for the execution of the theme and the originality of the cabinet itself.

RATING: 7
I have played so many different types of games that it is increasingly difficult to come upon something truely original and new.  Master Thieves is a unique game for the ambiance and physical aspect.  The Box works so well that noone in our group had to be reminded that you could alter its configuration at the end of your turn.  The roles are well balanced and there is a fair amount of drama in choosing what to do at every turn.  The game flows smoothly and for some reason your eyes stay glued to that thing as you try to keep track of where those precious diamonds might be.  The fun factor is really there and it is for everyone.  I don't think the game is as interesting with fewer players; we played a 4 player game and less would remove a lot of the tension and chaos.  Steeply priced, but a unique innovative game that looks and feels wonderful.  Love the way that drawers snap shut!

As a rule, I hate memory games, but this one was different. If the task of trying to remember what's in all the drawers seems too daunting, it doesn't really matter. On the turn you decide to be the Master Thief, just concentrate on remembering one of the ruby-filled drawers. That strategy worked fine for me. Overall, I found it a fun, really over-produced party game.

Ok, so I've played several games now and it still holds a decent rating for me.  I really enjoy role selection games and while this appears to be a memory game on the surface, it's just as much if not more about knowing when (or guessing when) to pick the right role.

1 play...Very interesting game.  I liked the role picking aspect of it.  Memmory is a very large component of the game, but there are options for some strategy.  Knowing what other people have played (both in roles and gems) helps with deciding who to play next. I would say that this would be a good non gamers game, almost falling under party game, but there was little to no socializing as each player was so intent on remembering where gems are.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (August 2013)

What a weird different game, I’m not sure how I feel about it. We played it with 7 players but I think the game should be played at most by 4 players, each additional player makes the game harder (which is not a bad thing), but also makes the game a lot longer with lots of downtime (a very bad thing in my book). The downside of fewer players is that the smugglers/detective interactions will occur a lot less. I’m not really sure about this and I will play it more to revisit the number of players topic.

The game runs too long for what it offers, perhaps this will be solved with a more focused group or (more likely) playing with less players.

The game is gorgeous and very expensive. The theme works great with the game mechanics.

You need to be really concentrated on this one or you will be guessing most of the time so it is not a game suitably for large/loud game gatherings, all the players should be focused on the game. The game rules are easy to teach, and (in general) the decisions are not that hard, the “game” is in the memory aspect. With many twists and turn of the box, it is very challenging to remember them all or just the relevant ones. I enjoy that.
 
Bottom line, It is a very demanding and hard game with simple rules. I want to play again with less players.

The wooden storage box, along with the ingenious 'game cube' and other components are absolutely gorgeous... oh, and the game plays great too.

It scales well from 2-8 people and can be played seriously or in a more social setting.  The game has been criticized because of the memory element, but I've found that there's no more to memorizing in this game than tracking the cards in Mamma Mia, counting the cubes in El Grande's castillo, or tracking tiles in Chicken Cha Cha Cha or Dawn Under.

Choosing the right role at the right time can also offset the memory element to a certain degree.  There are lots of laughs when a player pulls a drawer and a jewel drops out and sighs of relief when you play the only smuggler to find that no one else has played a Detective.  

If you like to outguess your opponents in games like Adel Verphlichtet and don't mind a little memory exercise added on for good measure, you can't do much better than Master Thieves.  And the best part... the game plays to completion in about 40 minutes, even with 8 players.  A solid 9.

Wonderful game with an awesome wooden box to play with. This game is about getting rid of fake gems and retrieving real ones. You do this by putting it into this box with many many compartments. After spinning it around, you try to retrieve it with certain cards.

With twelve drawers in a binary state and the box changing every time it is not possible to track everything.  On the other hand it is very simple to track a small number of drawers and just forget the rest.  Since nearly every turn a player change the top/bottom state of every drawer by flipping the box you can simply watch for a large treasure being placed by someone an even number of turns from you and then follow it.  The game looks wonderful but if the player simplifies the puzzle it is too easy and if they don't then the game becomes nearly random.

A game I never thought I would get to play. Master Thieves is an excellently-crafted physical gamepiece. The workmanship on the central box and drawers is so fine that the game was expensive back when it was in print. Now it's incredibly expensive, second-hand.

The workings of the game are difficult to describe (find a video), but the short story is this: There's no hidden information, but tracking multiple drawers is so difficult that you'll eventually lose track of all but 2 or 3. This is worth playing if only for the novelty of it all.

While preparing a play for new years eve I found that it came without character cards. all of them are missing.

So I wrote a mail to Zoch. And what do you know, the same day they respond that the cards are on their way to me.
I said I was willing to pay for them but they came at no expense.
I own the expansion too now. Thanks Zoch Verlag.

You can't beat that service.

I have great diffivulty in trying to remember the right drawers. Not really a game for me.

But it is great fun. Allthough we didn't play with the expansion I believe the expansion is a superb addition to this game.
I will definately play this again and I'm happy it is in my collection.
It won't be my first choice however.

Memorizing which gem(s) are in which compartments and following the motions after players flip/turn the contraption is extremely difficult.  I just tried to keep track of the cards played and what cards other players might possibly play.  A unique medium-weight game that is so, so hard to be skilled at, that it might as well come down to being somewhat random.  Rating is after one play with eight players.

Fun at first but tends to drag by the end.  I think it needs to end a bit more quickly but perhaps it is our lack of skill?  Beautiful bits!  Hidden Citadels like role card play except multiple players can take the same role.

RATING: 6
I am really not very good at spacial relations game. This one has kind of a feeling like Citadels, but it just doesn't do it quite as well.  For what type of price you pay for this one, you should probably try before you buy.  I think I can skip this one in my personal collection.

In a way, Meisterdiebe reminds me of Citadelles: at every turn, each player chooses a character with special abilities. Unlike Citadelle however, two or more identical characters may be present in the same round. Add to that a game of memory where you must remember the position of a given drawer in the physical, 3D space and you get a very unique game that should be played not only because of its extraordinary presentation.

Beautifully produced... but all it is is a memory game. You have to memorize 24 states (3 levels x 4 sides x top/down) and memorize these states as each level gets rotated and the box flipped. Then you add in the double-guessing aspect of the action cards... and it's just not my type of game.

A memory / role selection game with an extremely impressive jewelery box.  Sections of the box are twisted and turned and players are trying to find the gems hidden within or place alarms to foil the other thieves.  A fun experience as long as Pinhead doesn't show up.

Beautiful production but the gameplay just isn't there for me. The role selection process could be interesting but the differentiation between the roles is too small. The rest of the game is even worse: it's basically an elaborate three-dimensional shell game. For those who are good at tracking such fast moving information, it's elementary. For those who are not, or those who simply want to go to the bathroom or refill a drink, it becomes random chaos.

I don't often drop a C-note on a game, but I was so intrigued that in this case I swallowed hard and dug deep, and I'm really glad I did. The centerpiece here, an intricate wooden chest of drawers, alone makes this an astonishing game. But the gameplay is also very satisfying, with role-selection as the primary mechanic, and it scales surprisingly well for 2-6 players. [4 plays]

It's a much better game than some on BGG might lead you to believe.  The variable player powers make the game very interesting, as you have to decide which role will best get you those elusive gems you're looking for.

How do you keep track of what's in 24 compartments, contained inside one chest which is continually being rotated and spun about every turn? If you're normal, it's hard enough keeping track of 1 compartment, let alone 2 or more. This means this game, which is all about tracking compartments with the most jewels, opening them and claiming them, is just a horrible random mess that goes for way, way too long. The playing of characters, which are variations of placing jewels and claiming jewels, is frippery to dress the game up into something resembling an offering of meaningful decision and choice. My choice in future will be to avoid.

It's a good game, but must be played early, when everyone still has enough concentration to pay attention to the game.  The winner was the player that could track a good drawer for many turns.

Surprisingly, I found it a good game, better than I was expecting. With few players the mnemonic element is crucial and can do the difference; with many players it becomes more chaotic but also more fun - a sort of party-game.
Components are some of the best I've seen around.
All in all, for me it's a '7.5' for now, which becomes an '8' considering the fantastic components.

Played once with 7P. The puzzle box is a very intriguing gimmick that works surprisingly well. A fair amount of memory, timing and luck is needed to manipulate the box to a player's advantage. The hidden role selection mechanism is well-implemented, although the rules for some roles are a little fiddlier than others. I just wish that a game with such a crucial memory element played faster, as it can be exasperating to pay such close attention to the box for over an hour and a half.

RATING: 5.5
1 play, 4er, short version (with half the starting gems)

An interesting game, but much more interesting for it's wicked-cool component -- the chest with 3 independently rotating levels, each with a double-sided drawer (short or long) -- than for the game play itself. The chest can be flipped upside down, too. You can keep track of some things some times, but eventually (for most humans, anyway) it'll come down to random chance! VERY cool components, though! 

--- Summary ---
Setup: orient the drawers so all the short ones are on opposite sides, and all the long ones on the perpendicular sides. Then place several blue gems (2VP) and red gems (4VP) in the drawers in drawers (some specific, some chosen by players). Then spin the levels and/or flip the chest. Players each get a white and a black pillow; place starting gems (we used 4 white 1VP and 2 blue 2VP gems) on the white pillow. Players have identical hands of 6 role cards. Place red pillow on table.

Each round, simultaneously choose and reveal role cards. Resolve in specific order, each with a different effect. E.g., place gem from white pillow to a drawer, take gems on the red pillow, open a drawer partially (thief) or completely (master thief), etc. After a player takes their action (ordered by role; same roles go in numerical order), may turn top level or two and/or flip chest over. 

After all 6 cards played, pass cards to left player. Play continues till a player has gotten rid of all the gems from their white pillow. Winner is player with most VP on black pillow.

RATING: 7
Far, far more than a simple memory game, although memory is certainly an important part of it. The selection of roles is equally essential to the game, as is the careful manipulation of the various pieces. So, you've got a memory game, hand management, bluffing, and even dexterity going on here. Wonderful piece of art as game that actually plays very well as a game, too, which is relatively rare, in my experience. 

Also, as crazy as it may sound, the pieces are all worth the price. It really is a game that needs all the different elements to work as well as it does - I just don't think a lower quality production would capture the feel/theme/design as well.

That said, I agree with some that the artwork on the cards is a bit garish - not my speed, either, but I do think the beauty of the other components more than makes up for this.

Incidentally, if you do choose to play this as a two player game, I highly recommend the variant for two players suggested here on BGG when Smugglers and Detectives oppose each other. Roll 1d6 - on a 1-3, the Detective has caught the Smuggler, 4-6, the Smuggler gets away, and may perform his normal actions. Really essential, as these two cards wouldn't interact properly without them in a two player matchup.

[RGG 2004 edition] {Thieves; special apparatus, memory, simultaneous-action; optimal 4-6p} MT is thematic robbery game, in which players tries to steal jewels from a treasure box. It's very fun for casual play; however, if players force themselves to remember everything, the fun fades for the slowness.   It is more suitable for 4-6 players although the game supports up to 8 players because a round may run too long with 8 players. Many players state that MT is a memory game, which I can't agree completely.  There are memory element but I think the key point is guessing which cards (roles) other players may play.  Then, one can improve his chance of getting gems.

The production quality of the wooden box varies. I have watched 4 copies.  Quality of each one are not the same - some are better, some worse. Some players are worried that the wooden strains will affect the game play; for my experience, it does not.

A cross between a memory game, a family heirloom and a character-picking outguess-your-neighbour game. My memory is crap, so I generally just played the odds on character roles. Possibly more spinning & flipping than I need in life, but I'd enjoy further plays as long as people take it fairly light-heartedly, and don't agonise about plotting where that juicy draw was moved to. The velvet pads make my flesh crawl.

First the caveat: My tastes do not run toward memory games, or games requiring that you be adept at spacial relations.

Played at Essen 2007. The wooden box is certainly a lovely item and the game itself is better than I thought it would be. I imagined it would be a weak game dressed up in fancy packaging, but there was more to it with the second-guessing role selection and trying to track where the gems went as the box was manipulated. I think it would see some play when we have a large group (it plays up to 8), but the price tag is somewhat off-putting.

A lavish production.  Master Thieves has a cool concept, but was unfortunately quite a chore to play in reality.  Part memory and part observation driven.  Round after round you select different roles to help you get rid of imitation jewels in return for real ones.  While there is definitely skill involved, yet the majority of time it feels more like luck than anything else when one stumbles across a drawerful of treasure or when an alarm is triggered.  I like games that are able to accommodate a big group of people, however, our session did seem to go too long with an almost full complement of 7.  I'm glad to have tried it, but I doubt it is something I would care to come back to again.  A nice display piece if you're into collecting gimmicks and rare/unique items, too expensive as a game though.

RATING: 5
Don't be fooled by the cartoony art style, this game is super cutthroat but not in the good way. The problem I have is there just isn't much "game" here. Clearly the best option is to take cards on your turn and then just hope you get good stuff to survive the votes. Nice production and the cards have some funny flavor text but it's not enough to make up for what is just a mediocre semi-coop.

Couldn't really inject the semi-co-op feel into this. The cards are interesting, but the base actions themselves are mostly uninteresting (add water. add food. draw a card). I was excited for this game, but the design is limited and has some dated mechanics (miss a turn, player elimination). Would be overcome if the rest of the game were more exciting. Not recommended.

Das Gefühl auf einer Insel zu sitzen und gegen die Anstrengungen anzukämpfen kommt durch. Als Spiel leider nicht so gut, da das Karten ziehen aus dem Wrack meist zuviel Zeit kostet, dafür das Nieten drin sind und das Kartenbglück die Verhandlungsbasis beim Abstimmen zu stark bestimmt.

Did a few games with 6 players, up to 12 players.
I think above 8 people the rounds start to get a bit too long, from 5 to 8 is the best to play this game.
Also every game has been the same so far, the first 2 or 3 days, everybody pretty much play coop and everything goes well and the game is very boring, but when water or food starts to be scarce everybody play their cards, then there is a big vote and dead people and then we come back to cooperation until some people can leave the island.
In my opinion the game is really uneven, the plase with cards and discussion is obviously the most interesting part, but it's not the biggest part of the game.
That's why I put "only" 7.

This is a great game.  They gave me a pre-release copy at Dice Tower Con, and I've been playing it constantly. 

The thing about Hellapagos is that you're probably going to run out of food and water, and when that happens, the only reasonable course of action is to start killing people. If you're smart, you might want to get started early. 

In my first game, I saw the writing on the wall and secretly got my hands on a gun, but I lied and told people it was a water bottle. Then someone traded me for a bullet, thinking I wouldn't be able to use it. Later, when it started to get real, another player got sick and had to be put down, and I found yet another bullet in their possessions. The next turn I executed all who opposed me, got most of their stuff, and ruled with an iron fist, just me and my empty gun. Which everyone thought still had one more bullet.

Good times. :)

Cooperative game that has players deciding from one of four actions each turn, collecting food and water in order to survive, chopping wood to escape the island by raft, or drawing cargo cards, which may either help everyone, or help yourself. Things get ugly very fast unless everyone is determined to work together.

15-30m, best with 4-8 players. < 5 plays.

It's not bad, it's just that I don't feel any inclination to play this one again. Players fish to improve the group's food, collect water depending on the storm card, build rafts, or draw cards from the "shipwreck" pile. If, at the end of the round, there is not enough water or food for everyone, players vote on one person to die. Players can prevent their deaths by producing a shipwreck card that helps them survive. 

Not for me.

Played at Essen 2017. The first few rounds I thought "this is a cute game for kids". We played nice. Too nice. The last two rounds the gloves came off and they lasted almost as long as the previous 6 rounds. It was the most fun I had at the fair - bought the game instantly (although I had vowed NOT to get another game on the last day....)!

Certainly this is not a game for everyone, if you are too sensitive and don`t like the backstabbing mechanic, then you`ll have a pretty rough time playing, because the game is all about save your life at all costs. Yes...you need to let people die from starvation or you need to kill them to escape, form alliances etc. The concept that this is a coop game, but just until a point is a really brilliant idea and due this shipwrecked theme it feels like a board game inspired, by the TV show Survivor. 

Hellapagos really really needs the right group of people to play, but when you have the group for it, this game is a blast and really fun to play. Absolutely recommended for people who are not afraid to bluff and backstab other players in a social game setting.

The game was very easy to pick up and quite fun.  Having the gun forces you into making tough decisions!

This game is a lot of fun! I've played it with smaller groups of 4 & 5 and also with the max of 12, and it's just a blast to play. You are stranded on an island with your friends and need to build rafts, and gather enough food & water to get off the island... but not everyone is going to make it off... Some people will be voted off, some people will die... and others will selfishly hold back resources to guarantee their spot on the rafts... as long as you don't take this game too seriously and have a group of friends who don't mind backstabbing each other, then you'll have a great time! It's a short game, great filler/ice-breaker.

We just could never make any progress in the game and it never clicked for my group.  Lovely art and components though.

A fun little group game here. Simple actions, an ever increasing escalation of danger, and reality-TV style group-think and voting to kill off players makes for a fun social diversion. Add in special item cards and the semi-cooperative nature (it is usually theoretically possible for all players to survive and win), and you have a strong package for a larger group of people.

I really enjoy this survivor like board game. You definitely feel the pressure to survive the island and your fellow players.

I played this last night in a group of 12.  The game itself was fun and very light.  I think with 12 it is overloaded though.  We ran out of shipwreck cards on the third day.  The can be unforgiving as well. We had two days of no water which all but wiped us out.  Overall a good game and fun for a group of 7-10.

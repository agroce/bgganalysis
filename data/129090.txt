GAME: Roll For It!
RANK: 2588
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's OK - a half-step up from Yachtzee, probably wouldn't want to play it more than 3-4 times successively, but it's a good filler. Gives you the illusion of having tactical choices.  Comes in 2 versions that will combine to play 8. Bump N Roll is similaR but plays up to 6 ?? Some slight possibility of blocking/intercepting other player's desired cards.

This is almost not even a game. I mean it's a game like LCR or Yahtzee -where you roll until you get the right value. But there's hardly any decision making at all. Sure, we laughed alot during play - so it fit the situation perfectly. We were slap happy anyhow and this just gave us the reason to laugh. No regrets with the play at all - but not a game I'm going to buy.

Roll some dice, then lock most of them and spend several turns trying to complete the one 15-point card to catch up with your opponent who lucked into a 15-point card six turns ago.  No thanks.

Simplistic to a flaw.  Not even as much strategy as Yahtzee.  Practically all decisions (including Press Your Luck) are decided by evaluating probabilities.

A great little dice game. Roll For It is a Game Crafter alumni, and a game that I'm very familiar with from its website, which has a version you can play online for free.  As a game designer, I think it's brilliantly simple and something I wish I had thought of myself. As a player, it's a game that can be taught to anyone in just a few moments--there's not really any strategy involved, since your decisions are based only on what you happen to roll (it is a dice game, after all), but there are some tactical decisions to be made on each turn. Do you go for the big card that everyone else is going for, or do you break off on your own to nab a few of the smaller cards? Do you think you can actually roll six of a kind before anyone else, or should you just take your dice back and start over? How many times will you spend a turn rolling for one card before moving on? 

Plays best with four players, although I look forward to trying it with eight. Plays unbelievably fast, and works great for a family game night, but also fits nicely as a filler with gamer geek buddies. Acquired via Kickstarter.

RATING: 9
Love it! I'm giving this a high score. Not because it's an amazing design or it is anything super special. I am scoring it high because it meets all my needs for a good game to play with any of my kids. It's cute and colorful. It's easy to teach. It's very luck driven but with some decision making. You roll dice, which is always a plus for me. And it's extremely portable. As another note, I think I like this a tiny bit more than Age Of War. Being able to build up to a set over several turns makes it a little less frustrating.

A very chancy, super-light dice game that feels a lot like Yahtzee. It's so painfully light, but I can't deny it's appeal. You get a competitive vibe, and its small enough to break out while waiting for food at a restaurant. For what it is, it's actually quite fun.

Very simple dice game to be played with virtually anyone. Small box which holds dice for 8 players is good when you have lots of players but bad if you happen to fall of the table.

OK as a quick filler, but there really are better choices out there (we've played Wurfel Bohnanza recently -- a much better game, but also a much longer game).  Works with kids, non-gamers.  Dice are pretty small, the game can get frustrating when the dice don't roll your way time after time after time...

Very basic game for all ages. Good gateway game for families, people who think they do not like tabletop games, or people who only know about the "Classic" games from many decades ago. It is a simple dice-rolling worker placement game. Plays quickly and requires a little bit of decision-making and strategy. No scorecard or paper/pencil needed. Just the cards and the dice from the small box.

Very compact. Good game to pass time if you are stuck waiting somewhere. I have the red and the purple versions as the cards are different in each set and provide more variety when mixed together.

Dice rolling game.  All players are fighting for cards (out of three).  The cards come in varying difficulty: hardest (six matched dice) to easiest (two matching dice).  Obviously the harder cards will grant more points (15) while the easier cards grant much less (2 points).

The only thing that I think doesn't really work is the fact that the game ends immediately upon one person reaching 40 points.  I believe that gives the first player a leg up against the others.

RATING: 5
Fun light game.  I find the only problem are the cards that have 6 dice with all the same number.  These are too difficult and not worth the 15 points.  they are also frustrating as you inevitably are down to one die and spend each turn trying to get that last dumb number you need.  

It only took a few games for everyone around me to realize this so nombody would go for them.  Since the other cards cycle you accumulate these difficult cards.  This makes the game less fun.  There are plently of house rules you could use to fix this, like just take those dumb cards out.  

In fact that is what I am going to do next time I play.

No real decisions.  It is all luck.  Perhaps we were playing wrong, but at one point three of the cards were the 6 dice cards.  But you only have 6 dice!  It would take far too long to get those 15 points for it to matter.  So everyone just rolled for the 4th card. The game became  "Roll these dice.  If you get these numbers you win."

Picked this up to play with my kids (8 & 6) and was pleasantly surprised by it. We had previously watched UndeadViking's review of the game and it looked light, but I'd actually pick this over Zombie Dice as a push-your-luck game, as it feels like there's just a little bit more here. The risk of assigning your dice to cards that may get snatched up on you is (to me) more engaging than simply rolling dice and hoping that you get more brains than shotgun blasts. By no means is this game revolutionary, but there's just enough to it to keep things interesting over multiple plays and I'm hopeful that it will lead into some interest down the road in Castles of Burgundy or even Panamax.

Roll For It
MFG: Calliope Games
#of Players: 2 - 4
Age Range: 8+
Overall Construction: There are 2 different versions of the basic one in a red box & one in a purple box. The cards are of decent quality. Both sets have a corresponding color backs. The red set has Translucent dice. The purple set has Pearlized dice. The artwork is basic. They each have a rulebook as well that is pretty concise. 
Gameplay: Each player gets their set of 6 dice. Cards based on the number of players are played out in the center of the table. Each player takes turns trying to roll dice corresponding to the image on the cards. Each card has a designated amount of points and you are playing until someone hits 40 points. You can Put your dice on multiple cards, just make sure that you will still be able to claim at least 1 card. On your turn you can choose to pull your dice off, but if you do you have to remove all of your dice, so placement is critical.
Yes/No Recommend: Of course I recommend it. It’s possible for this game to trump Yahtzee as the best, most competitive dice game ever. Because this version of the game doesn’t have a specific theme, it should be a game that no one would object to. Neither of the decks have the same cards so they can be combined if you want to play a 5 – 8 player game. I even recommend buying both. Heck, you can even order the deluxe version as well. 
This game is quick and easy to learn. As with all dice games it is easy to set up, doesn’t take up a lot of space, & is easy to learn or teach. Get a copy, take it out, and show it off to your friends.
Where To Get It: Roll for it is definitely available at the local game stores, as it has been out for a little while now. Not sure about the Big Box stores, but Calliope Games’ website does have a store finder on it. Here is a link to their website. Feel free to visit it and check out their other products as well. http://www.calliopegames.com/read/42/roll-for-it

A nice, easy to learn, dice game that is a bit like a cross between set collection and Yahtzee.  In however many turns you need, try to roll your die and match the dice shown on the cards.  But others will be going for the same ones and can beat you to the score, making you switch to another card.
My gaming group took to this game quickly.  Nice packaging where one box lets you play 2-4, and a second box (with different colored dice) lets you expand that to 8 players, without any big sacrifice in playability.
Accessible and fun game!

It arrived from the Amazon warehouse deal. Good thing too, a couple of the green dice are missing their pip decorations. :) -- Then the two year old promptly tried to open it & managed to EAT one top edge of the box. :( -- Good thing it was AFTER I'd decided to keep the game.

Olivia (age almost 4) loves this game. So. Much. We had to play it 8 times in a row the night we got it, and she was STILL begging for more plays. She's got the mechanics down, but the gameplay decisions aren't quite there yet. I think we need to take out the cards with 4+ dice, because she tends to trap herself by placing some dice on the 6-dice cards and then putting some of her dice on other cards (so she doesn't have enough dice left to complete the 6er).

Cracking little dice roller which is very straightforward and quick to teach.

You are simple rolling your dice to match common "target" cards in the centre of the table.  As you match dice you place them next to the card, meaning you can't use them until you decide to take all your dice back, or you (or someone else) complete the card.  That's basically all there is to it, the harder the target then the bigger the points - first to a set amount of points wins.

My only problem with this game is that the targets which require all 6 of your dice to match can be very frustrating, as you'll often be rolling your last die for the 1/6 chance of rolling the right number over and over again.  But, that's the risk with going for the big cards I suppose!

Recommended as a light filler, also good that it can play up to 8 if you buy 2 boxes of the game.

Good for children, a game about rolling dice better than your opponent and not much else.  It's weakness of not having any depth is also what keeps it very simple and easy to play.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2014)

I already knew I liked the game as I recently played the deluxe edition. It is still very surprising for me that I like this kind of game, I usually hate games that have a lot of uncontrolled luck and are low on meaningful decisions, however I have had fun in every play of Roll for It! I think it is because the game is so simple and quick, very unassuming and a hit with non-gamers. 

I think the game is best played with four players, with more the game length and downtime begin to increase to unacceptable levels for such a simple game. It is mostly luck if you win or lose so to continue to be fun for me, it has to be played under 20 minutes.

Ok card quality, great dice.

Bottom line, a very simple game yet very fun. I already bought it and (for now) it is a keeper in my game collection. Much better than Age of War, a (somewhat) similar game I recently played. Also read my comment for the Deluxe edition which I rate a bit lower than this one.

Good game to keep around for the family, combine with the purple box edition to play up to 8 players, it's fast and very easy to teach and great for kids as well. I prefer the simple artwork of this version to the ornate artwork of the deluxe edition but both versions are good. Do not expect much depth to the game, good simple dice chucker.

Same exact game as the Red version except it comes with pearl dice instead of transparent dice.  (And the card backs are a different color.)  Each game can be played alone with 2-4 players, but if you combine them, you can play with up to 8.  The only difference is that you flip up 4 cards instead of 3 when playing with more than 4 players.  :-)

A great entry level worker placement game. What a great gateway into this mechanic. But the quality of production turns me off. The dice quality sucks bad, they're small, and don't have defined edges so they keep rolling. Have to bend the rulebook to get it to fit in the box. Do yourself a favor and replace the dice, and you'll have a better play experience.

Winning feels good only because you won. This game feels very empty. A good strategy can be destroyed by bad rolls.
Rolling dice is fun and it works as a good filler for a person with many filler games already. This game is really honest with what it is too. Why buy an elaborate board game involving a crazy board with moving parts different decks crazy theme which is very luck based when you could just get this game instead. A definite buy, you will play it and enjoy it with people even though its strategy light and themeless.

If you just want to roll some dice, you're better of playing many other games imho (I'd advice Qwinto with a small group, or Liar's dice with a large group). I guess as an introduction dice game for kids it's ok, but even then I'd sooner play good old Yahtzee.

Absolutely love this simple game.  Grew up in Italy, and my family lived out in the boondocks, so we spent many a winter night huddled in the kitchen using the oven for warmth and playing games.  Mille Bornes, Spades, all the standard kid ones, and oh yes, Yahtzee!  To this day my mom loves Yahtzee and pulls it out for family games.  When I saw this game, I immediately thought of her and bought it.  Lo and behold, she loved it!  She liked it so much and was asking where she could get it, that my wife and I gave her our copy as a gift.  We had to run out and pick up another copy for ourselves the following week, because we missed having it in our collection.

If you need a game that doesn't require your attention to play.  If you need a game that doesn't require you to think too much about what you are doing.  If you need a dice-chucking no-brainer.  Get this game.

My wife and I play this game while watching the Olympics.  It's nice to play during all the fodder in between the actual events.  But when the gun fires you can stop what you are doing and watch the TV.  When you focus back on the game you can pick up right where you left off.

I actually enjoy this game for it being what it is.  We did decide to adjust the rules for 2 players to make it more enjoyable.  For 2 players, each player use 12 dice and have 4 cards in the pool.  This makes for more meaningful choices and funner game play.

My wife seems to really enjoy this completely mindless and far-too-long dice-roller. I have no idea why - it's too long for a filler while having very little in the way of meaningful decisions.

It's not perse annoying to play, so I can't give it below a 3, but it's not really a game. There are almost no decisions to be made - just roll your dice and take what you can take. The only one really is whether to keep trying to complete a difficult card you've already invested dice on or to bail out and pull your invested dice back.  There are other light dice rolling games, like Qwixx, that are so, so much better than this.

RATING: 6
This fast and simple game is fun for families. Players take turns rolling dice to get numbers that match cards in the middle of the table first. Each card is worth a certain numbers of points and the first player to 40 points wins. 

Pros: Extremely simple gameplay rules, Fast game, can support up to 8 people when purchasing 2 games. Group fun

Cons: No real decision making or depth, entirely luck based

It's a good idea, but it would have been a better game if they would have changed the 15's to be more than just 6 of the same number. It makes them too hard to roll and not worth it. Also the 2 pointers are dumb because you need 3 of them to make them worth anything since you end at a multiple of 5. It would be nice if the 15's were worth 18. It would probably fix both problems.

The game itself is just okay.  It's kind of a cross between worker placement and push-your-luck.  It's quick and easy to learn, teach and play.  It's probably best played with non-gamer friends and family or as a filler game when waiting for people to arrive or between games.  My biggest problem with this game is the VERY LOW production quality of the components, especially the dice.  I own hundreds of games (including mass market and hobby) and this Roll For It! has some of the poorest quality dice I have seen in ANY game, which is ridiculous considering this is a DICE GAME.  Defects include the following:  gouges, deep scratches, edge bulges/molding marks, sloppy pip paint (or missing paint), dark spots inside the dice.  This is such a problem that it took two copies of the game plus some additional replacements pieces from the manufacturer to assemble one full game free from *major* defects.  In addition to the dice problems, the cards are thin/flimsy, one copy came with one card bent due to not being in the stack correctly with the cards were wrapped, and the other copy came with a mis-cut rule book and had cards that were slightly off-centered.  All of these issues are just not unacceptable.   Given the price and all of the defects, there are plenty of other, better games with better production values available at the same or lower price.  I simply cannot recommend this game and I will definitely not be purchasing any more Calliope products.

From Spirit Games

An OK, but slightly flawed dice roller, as some of the cards can be quite tricky to achieve, and if you have several of these out at the same time, the game can stall.

May be this could be alleviated if playing with both versions.

RATING: 6
A fun, portable, inexpensive, push-your-luck dice game. It doesn't take up much table space and plays quickly. There are just too many other fillers out there that are more engaging. I do think this would be a great game for travelers or cafe shops.

Very quick "use the dice to capture the card" game I like that you can leave dice associated with a card at the end of your turn in the hopes of completing on your next turn.

The little dice are so darn cute! 

It's a dice game, so of course there will be luck involved, but there are still some tricky decisions to be made. Which combination are you going to try to win, and are you going to win it before Roman does?

This game is really too simple for me, but I'll sometimes be interested in playing it. Especially at family gatherings and functions because the game is so simple to explain. I haven't tried the deluxe version, but I imagine that it is very chaotic, but a great party game.

A pure luck game, however, I feel it has its purpose and it fills that purpose perfectly.  My 72 year old mom will sit and play this game over and over. We go through the entire deck every game instead of the amount of cards the game recommends.  It brings my mom to the table.  Nuff said.

Only have played this with two people.  The game was WAY too short with two.  I feel the complexity of deciding which card to go with, and losing cards will intensify as more players are added.  Will revisit after playing with more!

This was a GenCon 2014 pickup (GenCon Special Edition).  Another fun, fast, dice-chucker.  Although it comes supplied with 8 sets of dice, my wife stopped by Chessex to pick up three more sets, since the game wasn't supplied with dice in colors she wanted (various pinks and purples).  We have only played it with a max of 4 players...I think anymore may suck out the fun factor waiting on turns.

Simple easy to play family game based on luck.

We like to have a wide range of games and this is a fun and quick dice game that can take a half hour or run to an hour (depending on how lucky the rollers are) Doesn't take much to learn and with 4 people it goes quickly. If some one takes an early lead it is possible to still catch up and win.

This is a dice rolling game each turn you get to roll up to 5 dice depending on how many dice you have left. Then you can place as many of those dice as you want on 4 cards of varying score. Once you have all of the dice depicted on the card you claim that card and the points associated with it. Its not my favorite game because of the degree of luck involved, but its not terrible for a filler, especially if your just in the mood to chuck some tiny dice.

This is one of our family's favorites.

Quick and easy game to pick up and get playing in just a minute or two. Would make a GREAT stocking stuffer! Easy for young kids to understand. My wife loves the game because she says she "doesn't have to think". My only negative (which can be a positive for some) is that it plays pretty quickly. There were lots of times when I wish the winning point total was set to 50 or 60 instead of just 40. But I guess we could've changed that ourselves.

After over 20 plays, I'm upping my rating to a 9.5. I never mind playing this game.

This game would be incredible with some expansion cards.

Disclosure: I consider myself a friend of the game's designer. I don't know if he reciprocates that feeling, though, as the last time we played a game together, I lapped him on the scoring track!

Roll for It! is a great light game, perfect for teaching to family members, budding gamers, and non-gamers. It also serves as a nice fast-paced filler for game nights with your core gaming group to open or close the evening. There's a real elegance to the game design, and the game plays smoothly and flows well from one turn to the next. I suspect many of the lower rankings on BGG are from the more hardcore gamer demographic as they are not this game's target audience, and the relative simplicity of the game compared to other offerings found on BGG may be a drawback to them.

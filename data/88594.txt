You are one of several tribes on a island with an erupting volcano. You take turns placing hexagonal tiles depicting lava flows on the table in a way that diverts the lava towards your enemies and away from your village while you build fortifications of different materials (some good some not so much) to protect yourself from the inevitable. For some reason this game never took off in my group. It seems like a fine mix between dominoes and "take that" with pretty colors. I always wanted to take a whole day and start macro and work my way micro by playing the following games (of which Eruption would be one)in the following order: Survive-->Eruption-->Life Boats-->Get Bit!.

(KIDS) This game worked even better than I expected.  It's a fairly simply tile placement and blocking game that feels like there is a ton of take that... and there is.  But, it is very much calmed by all sorts of catch up mechanisms in the game that seem to keep it close enough to be interesting and keep everyone involved.  At least, that's how it worked in our first game.

I'm not sure who this game is catering to.  It's your typical "take that" game where everyone theoretically should tie.  It's probably too vicious to be a family game.

Anyway, my feelings about this one can be summed up in a single word... "whatever".

Initial rating 4
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Straightforward rules makes it easy to learn, plays up to 6 and moves along at a nice pace. I like these easy and enjoyable games because they make good introductory games for new gamers while still being interesting to experienced gamers. 

The game is themed around saving your village from an erupting volcano. So far it seems very tactical. The board state can change a lot from one turn to the next. Burning through the lava tiles as quickly as possible may be an effective strategy.

You do 4 things during your turn (assess damage, draw/place a tile, draw/play a card and build a wall) with most of the action revolving around tile placement and card use. You need to direct lava towards the other players villages while deflecting it from your own. Walls can reposition a lava tile if the wall survives its contact with the lava. Cards can be used to affect the board, ex. remove an existing tile, or be turned in for a wall. The game ends if all the lava tiles are played or if a village reaches a 290 degrees.

It's a game sort of like "Survive! Escape from Atlantis" in which you try to do bad things to your opponents while trying to survive yourself. It's a lot of fun and I don't mind the randomness in the tile drawing and in the card drawing as the game shouldn't be played too seriously. It's a lot of fun and curses are cast upon each other when a new volcano is placed right next to your village... A great game in which 2, 3, 4 and 6 players are all great numbers (5 are imbalanced).

Pretty fun game of 'melt the other guy first'.  MY first play was with 2-players.   Need to run it through with more for a true rating.  SUPER luck heavy with the random tile draw.

Play with 4 players was MUCH more fun, so I increased my rating to a 7.  Tendency is to attack players on the other side of the board, just because they are the furthest away from you and that's exactly where you want hot lava.

Play with 5 players was not as much fun as with 4, but it comes close.  The tiles ran out too quickly with 5.  6 player must be ridiculous...

Luck Factor
A competitive survival game in which each player struggles to save his or her own village from destruction caused by an onslaught of lava from an erupting volcano. As lava enters a village, its temperature increases until it has burned up completely. Players can protect their own villages by placing lava tiles defensively and strategically building walls of various materials to hold back the lava. They are also rewarded with action cards for directing lava to other villages. Action cards allow players to rotate, replace, or remove the hexagonal lava tiles as well as cool down and fortify their own villages. Once the volcano has fully unleashed its fury, the player whose village is at the lowest temperature wins.

Good family game - excellent recovery mechanisms (so if you're losing, you get some big bonuses).  Potential for abuse (let yourself stay in a losing position right up until the end, then win), but it's not such a deep game that I care :-)

RATING: 6.75
This is a simple tile laying / "take that" game where you try and protect your village from the lava, and direct it to your opponent's villages.  It is fun!  I'm not sure why it is so much fun, but it is.

There are some interesting strategies, and some fun combos that you can pull off in the later part of the game.  My biggest complaint is that turns during the last quarter of the game can take a long time, because it is possible to go through 10+ cards in a turn.  While that is part of the fun, it is the most annoying / boring part for the other players while they sit through you contemplating your options.  In a heavier game, the other players have a lot to think about even when it's not their turn.  In this game, you have nothing to think about.  You're just waiting for your turn to come along.

But besides that one complaint, this is a game that I highly recommend to families, or as a filler for gamers.  It really is fun.

Very impressed, this is a great family game!  See my comprehensive pictorial review: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/715994

Can be quite confrontational, which makes it good as 2 player (no ganging up).  With four or more down-time can start becoming an issue.  Some great in-built catch-up mechanisms to prevent runaway leaders.  Great theme, components, and fun!

Interesting tile placement game but immediately after playing almost all players said they felt there should be more tiles.

As you only draw action cards when you connect a lava flow to a village the game encourages you to burn your opponents villages as the action cards can be very powerful. However due to the nature of the game play it is generally best to dick the player to your left (whose turn is next) to maximise the damage you do to then at the start of the turn before they are able to build walls etc to stem the flow of the lava.

The die mechanic for the lavaflow versus your walls is nice as you can never be certain just how long that wall you build will actually hold back the floe of lava.

The burn track around the edge of the score track is a nice mechanic allowing players further up into the danger zones do more with their turns and if they are the first to that danger zone spawn a new volcano, however only in the final turn of the game did anyone actually push into the second of the danger zones and nobody came close to the third danger zone. Maybe we all just played a little too nice or may be the track is actually a little long for the amount of damage it is possible to inflict upon someones village.

Egy könnyed, gyors játék, amit nem nagyon lehet komolyan venni. Hangulatában nagyon hasonlít az Survive-ra, csak itt a lapkalerakás van a központban az emberkemozgatás helyett. Két fővel se volt rossz, szívesen kipróbálnám majd többen is.

Kipróbáltuk többen is (5-en). Nem éri el a survive szintjét. Kicssit fura a hőmérséklet emelkedésének a szabálya, egy ideig olyan mintha semmi se történne, aztán egy kör alatt szinte mindenki majdnem vagy teljesen besokall. Nagyon erős benne a -30 fok kártya. A végére hármat összegyűjtve szinte garantált a győzelem. 
Ettől fühhetlenül nem rossz játék, nem gémer társaságba, mert egyszerű, szórakoztató, és aránylag rövid, nomeg lehet akár hatan is játszani.

Actually pretty good cutthroat tile-laying game where you attack your neighbor's villages, try to save your own, throw up walls in defense, and play action cards to screw over everyone else's plans.

Cool catch-up mechanic where you grow more powerful (read: panicked I suppose) as your village grows hotter.  "If I'm going to cook, YOU ALL ARE!"

Surprisingly fun and satisfying.

What I didn't like:
- Some of the rules left us scratching our heads, but we worked it out OK.
- We can see where if you had more players, then people could gang up on you which is something I don't like (my reason for hating the game of RISK).

Love this game. It's just so much fun trying to burn up the other players villages. That in itself should tell you , that this is a cutthroat game and players will attack the weak, but the game balances that out, so that the weak have a chance and can come back, by allowing them more available option, than those that stronger and winning. Love how they balanced that out and it works well too. 

The game looks great, though the tiles are a bit on the thin side. Would've liked to see thicker tiles, but they do the job. There's also a lot of different ways to come up with and pull off some nice card combos, to really help yourself out or screw your opponents.

Lots of tension, fun and laughs to be had with this one. It's easy to teach/play nad plays fairly quick. Check out the video reviews and decide for yourself. I'm VERY happy I picked this one up.

I give it a five as a player that won't really play lighter gateway family games much anymore, but a 7 fun factor the rare times I do play it, so a 6 rating is a good compromise.

Bought a copy on sale from my FLGS. This seems like it would make a great double-bill with SURVIVE! And it reminds me slightly of Last Days of Pompeii, only this accommodates up to six players, while that only plays up to 4. 

This seems like a perfect casual game night game, or filler to open or close a regular gaming group meeting.

Played a print and play copy of this a friend received to do a pre-release review.  It is a highly interactive tile laying game with a lot of screw your opponent opportunities.  Players direct the lava flow away from themselves and towards their opponents.  Scoring is based on how often the lava hits your home area.  Low score at the end wins.  Subsystems include resource management you use for wall placement (to slow or stop the lava) and a card system with special powers that allow the players to do additional things with the lava flow, the walls, and the score track.  Dice are used to determine whether or not the walls are consumed by the lava, but the dice did not make the game feel out of control.  

Actually one of the pleasant surprises of the game was how little the luck seemed to decide things- surprising for a game with random tile draw, random card draw and dice.  The cards and tiles are very balanced, and overall, the other players' perception of your position plays a far bigger role than any of the seemingly random elements.  A couple lucky dice rolls and you will find the other players quickly concentrating on hurting you to compensate. 

We played with four, and it worked well and was very fast, with a lot of table talk.  I started the game winning but ended up as the ultimate loser because I failed to do any defensive tile placement, instead concentrating on hurting others.  

Overall, I liked this game for a light, fast, highly interactive eurogame.  For the type of game it is, it is very well done.

This is a decent game to play with your casual friends. Plays quickly and has lots of ways to mess with each other. Excellent premise, especially the lava tile-laying mechanic. 

My problem with the game is that the catch up mechanics are pretty heavy handed. Also, the actions available to the player evolve over the course of the game, but it's not terribly intuitive and can be difficult to track. 

The few games I've played seem to end very similarly. Solid casual game overall.

This is quite a novel game that uses hex tiles to represent lava flows from a volcano at the boards centre into one of six villages along the edge. The goal to be the last village standing while other villages are scorched. This is a great game for 4-6 people ... it plays fairly fast and there is ample screwage. A couple of house rules fix what appears to be a broken rule on tile placement. Highly recommended for a group game night. A visually appealing game that's fairly easy to learn and in my opinion is highly underrated.

I had thought I was getting into basically the latter half of Downfall of Pompeii wherein you draw random lava tiles to reduce your opponents possible score. In the most literal sense this is indeed what you're doing. This is not related to that experience in any other way, however. It's mainly trying to make best use of a lava tile, either offensively or defensively. You have to make some hard choices at times given that you harm others, or gain resources, or simply stem the tide of lava at your doorstep. Sometimes a play is a real gamble, which adds to the tension. The card play in the game is also multi-faceted and all cards are always useful. My favorite aspect of the game is that the more damage you take the greater the bonuses you have. It's even feasible to intentionally take damage or deal yourself damage simply to gain bonuses to strengthen your game.

So far with both 2 and 3 players this is quite a good game. It has moderate luck and moderate tactics. There are ways to make the game more strategic, found in the variants of the game, but I'm not sure I would want it to be. I'm interested in trying the game with all player counts. given that this goes to 6 I'm sure the chaos factor, and the utter insanity, will actually lead to a different kind of fun; or so I hope. With 2 or 3 the games were entirely different animals, in a very good way. This game has easily met my expectations and is a good deal of fun. It's also CHEAP, even at a FLGS, and the components are quite nice for the price.

I was pretty excited about this because Stratus Games is a local Tucson company.  It certainly helps that this is a great game and we've had a blast with it across several groups.  I tend to stay away from direct confrontation games, but this provides a nice mechanic (gaining valuable cards) which encourages everyone to dump lava in the direction of opponent's villages without it feeling quite so combative.  The progression track provides nice balance to assist players who take more of a beating early on.  For a light-medium game with a good balance of strategy and luck, a colorful theme, and the ability to scale well up to 6 players, this is a very good choice.

The volcano is erupting, quick prepare your village using anything you have on hand...straw, wood or stone. Perhaps I will brace this area with a straw wall...hmm...well...I hope it holds! This is a fun medium weight week night game. The board is a wonderful round island with a volcano of tiles in the center. I think it probably is a blast with 3 or more players. We have only played it so far with 2 players, and it plays very well. You basically play a tile of lava flowing out from the volcano, directing it's flow to your neighbors villages, trying to keep the lava from reaching your own. You can play cards to get resources or to have a game effect. As players have lava breach their walls the heat meter rises and the intensity of heat on the island increases. This is a great mechanic to the game.

An ill-designed take-that game. Players take turns placing tiles which represent lava flow, aiming to get the lava flow directed into opponents' villages. So when you leave your turn, there's no lava at your doors, 5 opponent's turns later and you've got suddenly for 4 lava flows at your doors and you're up massive points (low score wins), nothing you could do. Yep, that's fun. So theoretically, everyone should get their fair share of lava at their door and be scoring so that things are roughly level approaching the end-game (implying what's the point of the first 80% of the game to an extent), maybe a couple of extra people have been extra hosed, but the leaders should be directing lava towards their competitors now. But everyone's now scoring high each turn as most of the lava tiles are out and the board's mostly covered, so 1) who's lucky enough to miss out on a final turn (the players to the left of the player who ends up going last, good for them) and 2) who's collected the massively important lose 3 VPs cards, kept them all game and played them on their final turn after which no one can do much about it. Turns are pretty basic - draw a lava tile, place it so it goes into someone's village if you can as each flow you place into a village gets you cards and cards are massively important. Play your cards to move and twist tiles around (or keep score cards until the end). Thematically fun, turns are decent in themselves (choosing where to place, playing your cards), but 60 minutes of feeling out of control and then seeing the game lost by turn order and cards you never saw can have you considering whether that was time you want back.

This is a pleasure to play and teach. Colorful, thematic, and fun for women and men, young and older, 2 to 6 players. Everyone tries to keep their village cool, while redirecting lava flow to other villages. Quality components. Great artwork and graphics.  Eruption is also comparable to Survive-Escape From Atlantis, or The Downfall of Pompeii, but I believe it very much stands out on it's own.

IMO, this is Chris James' best game to date.

First of all I want to thank the publisher for having offered the print and play version of the game.
It is the first time when I see it. One thank you to him.
The game is a succession of pose of tiles and cards played to annoy hisopponents and protect its village.
There is so much strategy as fate. Strategy in the pose of tiles to invade the opposite villages. Luck when it is necessary to throw dices to verify if walls are or not going to resist.
The beginning of the party is a little bit slow, but it gets into a panic fast when the heat rises.
A good game which I recommend in all.

It is a family game, but cutthroat. You have to attack the other players rather quickly if you want to endure the lava. The cards and rolls add good variability, making this great for balancing different skill players.

Screw your neighbor - or more accurately, cover their village in lava! This game is only good if everyone is vicious to their neighbors - it falls flat if people play nice. A toss up between this and Survive! Escape from Atlantis as to the better "screw your neighbor" game.

RATING: 6
This is a good little tile laying game that supports 6. It can be very mean and cutthroat but that is okay because everyone has to do it. The game makes it obvious who is in the lead and the scoring/end game condition pushes players to attack the leader.

I suggest playing that only one rain card can be played on a turn. This prevents a player that got a lucky card draw from holding onto them playing several on the last turn.

The rain cards should be house ruled to limit them to one per turn.

Once I was hit i just continued to get burned.  With absolutely no way I could win.  Not that I didn't cause some havoc for those that attacked me, but there was no catching up.

I really enjoyed this game! It was fun watching the game develop & how people react to every tile placed. 

It's okay to play with 2 players, but I think you'd enjoy the game much more with 4 or 6 players, preferably with the "Clan" rules in play.  

The game is balanced & even if you aren't doing so well, you get enough advantage that you may be able to recover from it.

Success in this game depends a lot on luck--which tiles you draw, which cards you draw, and so on.  It doesn't really feel like you can plan from turn to turn very much.

A good tile laying game with confrontation that has players sending lava at the other villages. But with 6 players each player doesn't get a lot of action or chances to affect the game.

Eruption is a competitive survival game in which each player struggles to save his or her own village from destruction caused by an onslaught of lava from an erupting volcano. As lava enters a village, its temperature increases until it has burned up completely. Players can protect their own villages by placing lava tiles defensively and strategically building walls of various materials to hold back the lava. They are also rewarded with action cards for directing lava to other villages. Action cards allow players to rotate, replace, or remove the hexagonal lava tiles as well as cool down and fortify their own villages. Once the volcano has fully unleashed its fury, the player whose village is at the lowest temperature wins.

Enjoyable tile placing game with 'screw your neighbour' aspects. Bit of a slow start, but once you get going it's fun. The extra moves the danger zones give you keeps the game flowing and the players close. 

Played 5 player with kids and adults (ages 10 - 30s). Game ended due to running out of tiles. I think 4 player might be the sweet spot for the number of tiles included.

This game is more than the sum of its parts.  Its a fairly simple, probably gateway level game.  Its very quick to play and is over before you know it.  I can't point to anyone particular part of it that stands out that makes it fun and yet when taken as a whole proves to be a very enjoyable experience.  We have broke it out for two different groups of people so far who each had very good reactions.

玩家们将会用石头、木材或稻草建立围墙，阻止熔岩流入他们的村庄。此外，他们可能旋转熔岩棋子，让其流向其他地方。每个村庄的温度都在随着熔岩流入和火山爆发而升高，如果一名玩家幸运地获得正确的卡牌，村庄就可能冷却。一旦火山完成喷发，温度最低的玩家获胜！

我觉得还是个蛮有趣的游戏！互动比较好！

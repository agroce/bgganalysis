RATING: 7
Part of Kevin Zucker's superb Campiagns of Napoleon-Series (CNS-1x) depicting the French forces trying to defend their homeland, pushed along by Prussian and Russian forces. While Napoleon succeeded here and there, the victories haven't brought a change to the overall situation. At the end the Allied forces entered Paris to force Napoleon to his abdication leaving for Elba.

Napoleonic Warfare on operational level (regimental/brigade-size). 

A must for all the Napoleon-Grognards

The first of Kevin Zucker's definitive Campaigns of Napoleon series. A beautiful game, brilliant system, and fascinating topic. The scenario layout is a bit odd and hard to get used to, but the game is the best operational treatment of the 1814 campaign available. Maps are solid, counters are pedestrian but functional. The cover of the AH version is one of the worst ever. Don't be fooled. You can buy the game cheap, but it's a bargain at any price.

RATING: 7
AH version has an annoying map panel arrangement that springs up unless heavy objects placed on top. Balance was suspect in this version and too easy for the French. Balance is better in the updated OSG version.

Counters have very small typeface in this edition. Still this was one of my early games and was inspired to try after reading F.L Petre's history of the campaign.

"Napoleon at Bay is a division level, two-player simulation of the Campaign of 1814 which was one of Napoleon's finest. He conducted this campaign with subtlety and lightning speed against heavy odds, attacking isolated enemy forces on advantageous terms. This game shows Napoleon's skill in a classic use of interior lines, shifting to engage the combined armies of Russia, Prussia and Austria."

The geek description is copied here as frankly I haven't played this game and have little first-hand to say about it. It looks like another miniatures style game rendered into a hex and counter format. Looks pretty complex to play as well. For a particular taste in Napoleonics I suspect. I'd be happy to trade it away...make me an offer!

So far, this is the only Zucker design that I really like.
It has its problems (poor rules and set-up) , as always,
but the big difference is, for whatever reason, this one
is actually FUN.

RATING: 9
One of the best games of its era, the father of a system still being published decades later. This is the simplest game in the series, because while there are a lot of rules, but not a lot of chrome. If Napoleon wins some big victories early on, then you'll have a competitive session. Otherwise, just watch as the Coalition juggernaut lumbers towards Paris. Bookkeeping can get excessive and the pieces are hard to read.

I missed a component in this game (AH edition) and hence didn't play it over 10 years.  I hope someday I can find the replacement.  This is a great system and an excellent game.  Kevin Zucker proved himself the greatest researcher and game designer in Napoleonic operational warfare.  I can see no one can replace him even in the next 10 eyars.  Check out the latest "deluxe" edition of Napoleon at Bay by OSG too.

Great game.  The fold out board is still entact after 25 years and multiple plays.  Had a hard time with this system at first.  I overcomplicated it. I got it down to "Who can tell who". "What to do" Where to go" When to do it".  The French are easy in this aspect however the Allies are different.  One has to keep the two seperate and remember "Who belongs to Who". Tricky communications.  +'s It's a Kevin Zucker game;brilliant.  The game board.  Graphics are excellent and it set's a standard that you don't see anymore.  -'s Come on no die nor counter tray? The attrition Quotient?

Division level simulation of the Napoleonic Campaign of 1814 as part of the Campaigns of Napoleon System series.  One of the first Napoleonic games to simulate accurately the critical nature of roads and ability to maneuver and to reflect logistical and administrative considerations in a realistic manner.

RATING: 7.5
A fine game system, worthy of a 9 rating was it not for institutional bias in favour of the French side throughout Zucker's whole series.


Try and move the allies in an historical fashion between different set-up dates without driving them into the ground due to attrition. Impossible. Sometimes it is difficult to even GET them to where they were historically!

That said, with tweaking of the movement, command point and attrition tables to allow historical results it can become one of the best Napoleonic games on the market. The basic system is so elegant!

I got this game off Ebay and I was surprised & happy to see two mounted boards but that is where my happiness ended. The designer is all about logistics as the driver of Napoleonic campaigning and I agree with him. The problem is that that is no fun.

When I came across Kevin Zucker's games in the early 1980s, it was an epiphanal moment. He has distilled the really important aspects of operational fighting into a system which actually relates to military-historical accounts. After about fifteen years out of the hobby, it was curiosity about what Mr. Zucker might have been up to since which drew me back in. I liked this system from the start and the loving attention to the leader displays and the fact that OSG proofread their rules and playtest their games properly, means that they are the Rolls Royce of game design. Nothing is there which doesn't have to be there. The only thing I didn't like about this edition was the AH box art.

The game is fairly involved, but all of the rules make good sense.  Unlike a lot of games, this one forces you to maneuver and think.  The scenario is definitely rough on the French.  My main problem is that every time I sent Napoleon into battle, the dice decided to side with the Coalition.

Only played twice, and then realized that I'd really have to sharpen my intellectual framework of napoleonic-era strategy and tactics to fully enjoy this game and system. Glad I have it for the $4 paid in the early 90's at a Kay-Bee, as I will eventually invest myself more in the period and pull this right back off the shelf and onto the table, as there is alot here that reminds me of the GCACW system's relationship to the Civil War.

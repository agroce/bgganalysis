LIKE: Good gateway, tile placement game. Mining for gold using the tents is fun. Just enough competition and interaction. Blocking and stealing is more prominent than in South Seas (the Carcassonne version I play the most).
DISLIKE: Scoring is a touch fiddly. Players can possibly get meeples stuck if a bad position is chosen. Two trains on one track canceling each other out is a little odd.

OVERALL: Very fun, worthy game, nice competitive feel. The tempo of using the tents and when to place meeples in the prairie makes for a well-rounded experience. My wife says the game has a masculine feel. South Seas Carcassonne is easier to track scoring, but the cities in Gold Rush are more fun than the markets in South Seas.

RATING: 6
A very pleasant Carc game.  It adds some thematic elements and some hidden information to keep things interesting.  The brown of the mountain and green of the grass were almost a little too close for my liking.  (I giggled a bit at how "Ghost Town" and "Nashville" are listed as Old West towns next to Carson City and Deadwood.)

RATING: 7
A little meaner than usual Carc games/expansions since part of the game play is claim jumping and stealing gold nuggets. The luck of the nuggets vs. rocks on the backs of tokens might put some people off. Still loving this around the world series, but so far South Seas is the better of the two.

I love how this game manages to add new and interesting twists to Carc while staying thematic. Of particular interest are the town scoring (with complete railroads), mining tokens (which add a bit of luck and a very welcome uncertainty for the endgame scoring) and the mining tents. At first, I thought the art was a bit garish, but in the end, it works well and is very clear. All in all, I'm quite pleased with this.

Carc visits the Old West, morphing monasteries into cities, roads into railroads, cities into hills full of gold, and the critters from Hunters and Gatherers into Indian camps and horses.  The main innovation is gold mines, which add a rather random element to scoring.  For me this makes it the weakest of the versions I have played.

As ever, the tiles create a good looking bird's eye image of a patch of land.  Production quality is to the usual standards.

Just more good stuff. What I enjoy about Gold Rush is how differently it plays from the original. Whereas cities can be big scoring opportunities in Carcassonne, completed mountains may be boons, but only if mining tokens haven't been depleted. Like cloisters, cities in GR can be big-time scorers, but only if train routes have been completed. And the tent addition makes for some interesting decision making. Overall I enjoy it, and have yet to bring the Sheriff mini-expansion to the table. I still prefer the original, and playing this at times will keep Carcassonne from getting stale. Highly recommended.

I am a fan of Carcassonne and this adds enough differences to make it worth keeping.  The mining tokens add some nice bonuses for the end without making it swingy, and the tents help to balance that out by being able to take tokens before fully scoring the area.

The little cowboy-meeples are SO cute, I have to have this game! I like the tepees and the appaloosas in the prairie too!
The gold nuggets tokens are a bit fiddly though, and they take up space on the mountains, obscuring the tiles.

Spices up the base Carcassonne game in a new and interesting way. I think I'd rather play this than the standard game any day.

What I Like:
* The game has few rules and is reasonably easy to teach
* The game plays fast and is easy to score
* While it plays slightly different it is still fun with any number of players.
* Game plays different each time
* Can play to be cruel or kind to the other players.

What I didn't like
* The differences from the generic game are dull and don't add much to the game itself
* Nothing about this game makes it worthwhile to add to your collection alongside the base game.
* Better off getting the base game and expansions as needed

I enjoyed this version a lot. The tile laying element of Carcassonne is subsumed here, with a greater emphasis on constant scoring by using your tent. But with so few meeples in hand, getting one locked down could be fatal to your game, so it's a very canny mix. 

Opportunistic scoring and some luck in the tile draw but also some longer thinking. So it feels less like Carcassonne and more like a new game. Not an entirely new game, but this tent aspect, I can see that being used in other games.

Another excellent self-contained carcassonne game. The ability to steal points out of different areas before they're score is a very fun and interesting mechanic (albeit much more confrontational than standard carcassonne) and is well balanced by the fear of the Marshall showing up to stop you. I also really like the train bonus point mechanism for the railroad tracks (they can make railroads far more lucrative than roads are in the normal game, but they can also be used to devalue railroads controlled by other players).

RATING: 6
More complicated than the original
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Changes the points at which players interact. Reducing meeples per player means you can't threaten someones majority on a feature, but the tent means you can leech value. Four meeples means the choice to place is even more important than before, and knowing how likely something is to complete or the weaknesses of positions is even more important. I think for an experienced Carc player this is better than the base game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice, pleasant Carcassonne variant. The gold mining/stealing mechanic is the real highlight, as it gives you something to do on turns where you otherwise would have no useful actions. Having only 4 meeples makes trying to steal things from other players riskier, which is a mixed bag. The new cities feel a little risky to play on early in the game as completing enough railways for them feels somewhat like a crapshoot. The trains that can double the value of a rail route are nice and can be used both offensively and defensively. The different scoring for farmers felt fine although not especially different final-score wise compared to the regular scoring.

Carcassonne a vadnyugaton. Hozza a szokásos Carcassonne színvonalat, a tematika egész jól sikerült.Kevés emberünk van, így jól meg kell gondolni mikor rakjuk le őket. Bejönnek az aranybányák, amelyre vaktában rakunk fel pontokat érő korongokat. Akik be tudják fejezni az aranybányát 1 pontot kapnak minden lapkáért, de megkapják az összes aranyat. Döntetlen esetén szétosztják. Viszont ember helyett sátrat is rakhatunk bányába (akár máséba is!). És ha nem rakunk egy körben embert, bányászhatunk aranyat. 30-40 pont is összejöhet ebből a játék végére. De miután nem látjuk ki mit bányászik ki (0-5 pont között) így nem tudni, ki hogy áll a játékban. 

Viszont az útvonalat erősíti a játék. Vasútvonalat kell építeni és a mozdony megduplázza az érte kapott pontokat, márpedig nagyon sok mozdonyos vasútlapka van.

First impression better than base Carcassonne. Farms are based on icons, not cities, putting clearer emphasis on obtaining them. Mountains produce icons other players can siphon for random victory points. The monastery equivalent requires roads to complete, making it somewhat easier.

RATING: 5
the tents are nice, giving you something to do when you can't/don't want to place a meeple.

The hidden tiles that you get with tents or from completing cities are too random though, arguably the luck should even out if everyone has enough of them, but it doesn't work out that way.

Man, I'm really having a lot of fun with these Carcassonne games.  Gold Rush is so awesome to me.  I love having the random luck factor of the mining areas.  I also think how the cities work in this over vanilla Carcassonne is a lot neater of an idea with having the trains connecting everything.  For such small changes, it still stays true to the idea of the game, but adds a high dose of fun, at least for me.  I really love it.

The second game in Wrede’s Carcassonne-around-the-world series. It’s easier than Südsee as the mining action as main innovation is nicely integrated, thematic and less confusing than the fishing action and the added resource management in Südsee. The mining itself adds another source of randomness increasing the luck factor. The western towns add atmosphere. The tile set is peculiarly limited leaving few possibilities to block out players from mountains while making it easier to prevent closure of a region. Combined with the limited supply of only four meeples there’s a higher risk to be left without any placeable meeples than in any other Carcassonne version. Südsee avoided this trap with the possibility to retrieve meeples instead of placing one. At least, each incomplete region will be scored at game end. A good variation on the well-known system but only for completionists it’s a must-buy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Cities and monasteries offer something quite new and the tents are a neat addition to eliminate the effect of crappy tile drawing a bit. The one loc restriction on the other hand wasn't that nice because especially as there aren't that many meeples available the likelihood that everybody has an own road project is low and therefore the locs are often used to screw others' roads.

[11-July-2015] I prefer this to Carcassonne: South Seas, it is another standalone Carcassonne, but to me it feels closer to the Carcassonne than South Seas does.  It feels a bit like Carcassonne Hunters and Gatherers in that it is derivative and standalone.

Only having five meeples hurts, in the first game we both ran out of them.

The "cities" so far seem best used early in the game.

Yes, I also left Carcassonne collecting dust for years after I became a gamer, but somehow last year I found it again and what's more, I enjoyed what I saw, so while I'm preparing to play Carc a lot with my children soon, I'm enjoying this Carcassonne renessaince. And I did buy the newest spin-off and expansion as well...
Well, reading the rules I wasn't very impressed - the rules don't really add anything new (especially if you have played South Seas and Hills & Sheep) - it's more of a Carcassonne game designed around the theme (wild west, gold rush) by a designer who's spent so much time in Carcassonneland that he just does not even need to be innovative anymore. Still, the game is quite fun and even the gameplay does feel different. It focuses a bit more on greed and making your opponent score lower for a feature than they hope. And drawing random (value 1 to 5) tokens gets a relatively high importance, but as there are lots of tiles to be drawn, this more or less gets even by the end (just like many dice rolls vs. one die roll would have the same effect).
While placement of meeple is more fun than drawing gold tiles, it's a fine little 30-minute filler, even though probably not worth buying if you have a few other Carc variants.

This was surprisingly good. I wasn't a big fan of South Seas, but Amazonas was really good, so I thought I'd give this a shot. This may be my favorite version of Carcassonne I've played so far. The interaction between the players is much higher here than in other games of the series, and I really like how the game is designed in such a way to encourage finishing mountains (castles) and railroads (roads) quickly due to the tents and locomotives, respectively. The mining tokens at the end of the game can be a tad random, but as long as you make sure to get a decent amount of them, I feel like it will mostly even out in the end.

[b]Carcassonne: Gold Rush[/b] was traded away in a math trade 8/2015. (Received Dynasties version of Sun Tzu)

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]The hidden scoring ended up introducing way to much randomness and fluctuation in the scoring. It is way too easy to get a couple of 0's while someone else gets a few 5's. I originally liked the idea of a hidden scoring element, but it was too random for my taste.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Great theme, artwork and components (cowboy meeples) that will definitely draw kids in. 
- Simplified farmer scoring, you now look for tepees and horses on the tiles which score you 2 and 4 points respectively.
- Mining tokens which you collect these tokens when finishing a mountain, tents which allow you to steal these tokens before a mountain is finished.
- Railroad tracks can now score like inns (2p per tile instead of 1) if you have 1 train on a section of track.
- The Sheriff mini expansion adds a few excellent editions to the game play.[/i]

RATING: 7
Interesting enough Wild West variant but the mining tokens are perhaps a bit too fiddly for my liking, both flipping them all face down during game set up and dispensing them on mountain tiles. Would have preferred the farming working as tepees versus horses (as with wolves versus sheep in Ark Of The Covenant and saber-tooth tigers versus deer in Hunters & Gatherers) to make game play more cutthroat instead of both scoring. Found being limited to four followers quite taxing, especially as you cannot retrieve one as with the South Seas variant and did most of my scoring using the tent.

Prefer the South Seas variant both for graphics and strategy.

2nd in Around the World series. Introduces mining tokens (luck of the draw), and claim jumping mechanics (siphoning away mining tokens from uncompleted mountains). A mashup of somewhat fiddly scoring without providing much that is novel, although it feels like it has higher player interaction (not everyone's cup of tea - claim jumping, railroad engine spiking).

Best Carc theme so far, and the mechanic of placing tents and removing gold chits is clever, however, it's too easy to do. Every player seems to take a chit every few turns.  And placing those chits every time mountain tiles are drawn makes the game a bit diddly. Not sure if this is a keeper yet.

:thumbsup: There’s more turns with active decision making than vanilla [thing=822][/thing]. On turns when you don’t play a meeple, you can still place or remove a tent, and gather nuggets.
:thumbsup: Clever tile placement gets more attention: scoring of railroads (bonus points for [u]one[/u] train), different points in field scoring depending on number of tipis and stallions, towns that score for finished railroads,... These in turn open up more possibilities to hinder your opponent.
:thumbsup: Theme is very well integrated: cowboy meeples, rush for the nuggets,...

----

:thumbsdown: I can’t say whether or not the random draw of the nuggets lends an unfair advantage to nugget scoring.

So I went ahead and made some custom rattlesnakes for Carcassonne Gold Rush. Simple little theme-appropriate fan addition to offset the potentially imbalanced meadow scoring that can result when one player draws a disproportionate number of stallion and teepee tiles. Instead of placing a meeple or mining for gold "In them thar mountains" you can elect to place one rattlesnake token in your opponent's meadow. It acts to reduce their end game meadow scoring by one point per snake. If however you fully invest in the strategy and place five or more snakes your opponent is dealing with a snake den and suffers a two point loss per snake. 

Initial play testing is promising. In one instance it successfully mitigated runaway meadow scoring, in a second match the mere presence of rattlesnakes affected tile placement such that exceptionally large meadows did not form. Of course, the snake charmer suffers too because you aren't able to score points yourself when releasing serpents on your foe and it largely precludes you from later joining a bonus filled meadow. But, there are times when you have no meeples left or plays available that can result in scoring which is the perfect time to play a rattlesnake. With this new small edition we are really enjoying Carcassonne Gold Rush.

[2 plays] Great fun! Love the theme and the gold mining mechanic. There is always a way to make points and to interact with the other players' earning.

This is now hands down my favorite Carcassone game for more than two players. Carc the Castle may still hold the top spot for a 2 player contest.

Most recent play Memorial Day '16.

a little randomness brought by mining tokes compared to the original Carcassonne...

The new rules/changes to this from basic Carcassonne are really nice. I especially like the way the gold mines/tents work so that there is an incentive to try to make smaller mountains but also you always have something you can do on most turns after placing a tile (moving your tent or taking mine tokens from mountains. It's still Carcassonne at it's core but it's enough of a change from the base game that I like having both.

A very good addition to the Carcassonne family. It has enough tweaks (picking up gold in the mountains; finishing a city by finishing the railroads) to make it unique, and a bit of screwage for those that like to be nasty (stealing gold from someone else, adding a train to their tracks when it would be doubled).

This and Hunters and Gatherers are my go-to Carc games. The rules add some of the complexity without the length of the original game with some of the expansions.

This game is fun! I have not play the regular carcassonne, but I was told that being able to do some gold mining make this more fun then the regular carcassonne. Fully enjoy it
as a 2 person game. I think it gets a little difficult and slow to play if there is 5 players tho

Like the tents - gives you some,thing to do if you can't place a meeple. Plus adds a little interaction in the mountains. Also the logos changing the value of railways, and the cross incentives in  towns with railways. A really nice addition to the Carcassonne franchise.

[Zman 2014 edition] {Adventure; tile-lying; optimal 3p} This is a nice twist from Carcassonne since Hunters and Gatherers.  This one may be a better family game because there is more luck involved and less brutal.

The interaction is good and the game is more tense because players have fewer meeples.  Players cannot spend all their meeples casually.  Players have to actively complete for score in this game!

If one is familiar with Carcassonne, there is no difficulty in explaining the rules.  My daughter can understand the game instantly.

Love this game. I tend to find a prefer themed variants on certain classic games and this really fits the bill. I guess it makes life easier for the completionist in me, as there aren't 2000 expansions for this version. :) i like the differences between this and the standard version, with the tents you can let you claim jump the gold in them there hills. :)

I've played Carc a lot, but not in several years.  I was not expecting to like this overmuch.  I figured I'd moved on as a gamer, but this would be a good theme for when I introduce Carc to my kid at some point.  I played it recently, and was surprised by how much I liked it.  Some of the fun was just because Carc is that good (and I needed to be reminded of that).  The rest of it was because this version adds a couple of neat changes to the game. Nothing feels tacked on or goofy in any way.  Great stuff.

For me, this is the prettiest of the Carcassonne games. Love the look. I liked the horses in the green, the trains and steeling someone's gold. Would prefer this over the base game. The towns are a bit strange though, could have been done better.

RATING: 7.2
OK versione of Carcassonne, not as nice as Sudsee as a game and visually, but still a nice addition to the series.
The worst part: the tokens are too fiddly to manage and too often you turn them accidentaly showing what they are hiding.
The best part: finally something good to do when you don't have meeples to place: using the tent!

It's Carcassonne. There have been added gold nuggets and tents and the scoring is a little bit different, but it's still Carcassonne.

This is my favorite Carc variant.  Being able to do something with your pieces other than just place a tile every turn really keeps me in the game more.  In addition to that trying to only keep one train on each of your rails and getting your tent in the right position to steal gold out from other people gives you a little more to think about than vanilla Carc without the added length from expansions.

Ancora chiuso sigillato. Giugno 2017 finalmente dopo più di un anno dall'acquisto lo abbiamo provato. In due. Carina idea di un carcassonne nel west, ma poco oltre le "pepite" comunque rimane una "variante" interessante ma che non ci ha sconvolto come comunque era nelle previsioni. Facile rapido e rilassante specie in due.

Based on 1 game.  None of us had played before and we struggled with the basic strategy and the rules.  I think we need to read up on the 'geek some guidelines for newbies, if such a thing exists.  Played again and enjoyed it much more - it helped playing with some people who have played before.

A trick-taking game like Bridge, but without the arcane and brain-cramping bidding procedures. The game requires strategy at many levels -- bidding, leading, trick-taking, point-taking, and going out. Negative: better have someone else "tichu" the game because the rules  sheet is very confusing.

I do not like suicide Tichu anymore.  Not after learning this nifty passing convention.  I will not play Tichu without this convention any more.  Its a little convoluted but here it is.  If you draw one of the power6 cards (dragon, phoenix or aces) then pass it to your partner. If you draw two, keep them both and pass an even card (or Q) to your partner.  If you draw none, then pass an odd card (or J,K).   Makes for a great game!

This is a game if I ever play in a group regularly that will become a classic.  A little getting used to if not used to climbing card games.  Otherwise, not that hard, but the partnership aspect really makes it a totally different beast.  A hell of a lot more stressful than 13.  Still its great,but needs a different mindset.  Several plays later, I still find the allowable sets annoying.  I like it cause everyone knows it, but I'd prefer to try some other climbing games before settling on this one.

I really, really liked playing Suicide Tichu.  I might drop it if I like my Tichu/VC version more, but until I get it played, I'll take Suicide Tichu any day.  (Suicide Tichu, every hand one partner on each team must call Tichu or grand).

But now I have decided that what I really, really, really like is playing mega agressive tichu with no care for ultimate winning.  Unfortunately this requires a partner who is willing to go along, but when it does, its a lovely game.

Very smart team cardgame (2vs2). Involves a fair amount of luck, but skill is also important to increase win rates, up to a point of 65%-70%, if playing with average players. There is great amount of strategy involved to increase your chance to win. It is extremely addictive and can cause great havoc among teammates, when someone does something not so bright, or gets very unlucky!
A set up to 1000 points, can take from 1 hour up to 4 hours since there are also negative points so be wary!

I played this first in Japan in 1999-2001, but there it was called Daifugou. Then forgot about it for eight years until I found it again in 2009 (this time with a name Tichu). The two games have a slighty different rules but are basically the same game.

I prefer Rikken, but Tichu is a superior game to whist. Carefully estimating when it is ok to call tichu is probably the most difficult part of the game which will determine how well you will perform in end. I don't think there is that much skill when actually playing the game.

I got it once and I traded before I played. I thought that if I wanted to play it, I could use a regular desk of cards.

I am NOT a fan of trick taking games, but this one did pretty well for me. I have been cautiously interested in this game because of the high reviews it's gotten, and this one is the best one I've played so far.

Trick taking doesn't usually work for me, but I could see this moving up to an 8 with a couple more plays. It's on my wishlist now because of the portability and accessibility to non gamers.

Played just the once and went down in flames, but I'd certainly be up for more games of this.

Good as the game is, I'm a little puzzled as to why it's performing so much better here on BGG than many other excellent traditional card games.  Sure, BGGers tend to be hostile to mainstream games with a million analysts, like Bridge or Poker, but there's a lot of great deep but relatively unanalysed games out there like Solo Whist, Scopone or Piquet, and I just don't see how it is that Tichu rates the pants off them.

Sure it's got it's moments, but really?!

I'm not sure that bombs and specials really make this any better than 500 or Euchre. It's just the same old stuff, climbing or no.

I played Asshole nearly every day at lunch in high school and this is much better. The partnership aspect makes the game what it is more so than anything else. I kind of wish the bombs were played in turn order, rather than how they are.

This might be a 9 but I'm a little burned out on it after only 12 plays just because when we play it it's all we play and we tend to play this rather than other games I want to play, which sucks.

Update: playing the android version (while sometimes boring due to the lack on human element) has taught me a lot about aggressive calling but has diminished my opinion of the game somewhat due to the predictability element. 

another update: I continue to grow bored with this game. It's good, but the honeymoon period is over in a big way.

yet another update: After playing some trick taking games (notably 42 and Tarock games) I'm pretty sure I prefer them. I also don't know why a blown call accrues negative points instead of adding to your opponents' score. The way the rules are written the game could theoretically never end. 

After continuing to discover and play more trick-takers I don't know why anyone plays climbing games. There's no discovery phase and watching someone go out because nobody can play on a full house is utterly boring. I don't despise Tichu but if I never played it again I wouldn't care.

2012 - Superb. Elegant, efficient and tense. Only problem is that the rules for any number of players other than 4 are a joke. Has to be played with 4. With the advent of "Haggis" this is not so much of an issue, though. I prefer this game to that, but needs must.

2018 - not getting to play this as much, but probably my most played game if you included all the mobile plays. Still an incredible design and I love it after all this time.

Simple game with a lot of depth when you get into it. Quick rounds helps offset bad rounds with good rounds though annoying luck fluctuations can lead to runaway winners. It's giant flaw is the "Calling Tichu" mechanic. Rather than having a game mechanic which would assist what would be considered a "bad hand" the Tichu bet takes a hand that would have already been considered a good hand without the bet and turns it into a fantastic hand.

It's pretty addictive. I've played "Big Two" growing up, and the extra cards are great for adding strategy to the game and passing adds to the strategy. Obviously, there will be hands that are ridiculously strong and some that are total garbage. It's nice, though, that long straights are really nice to have but, often, having one will mean that the rest of your hand is going to be terrible and you may have difficulty getting the lead. Likewise, having lots of control cards is really good but, while you'll often be able to end up with the lead, it takes a lot of turns to go out and losing the lead just once may let a mega-straight player go out ahead of you. And etc.

An interesting game with unusual mechanics.  A four-player partnership climbing game. Tichu presents lots of decisions; the most subtle around when to break up a set to take a trick and get the lead, and whether to play for yourself or to help your partner.  How best to use the four special cards remains a conundrum for me.  It's clever that the phoenix and dragon are both extremely useful and present something of a problem.  The more I play, the more I enjoy Tichu.

I have to admit, I am just a sucker for any trick-taking card game.  At first play, I welcomed Tichu with a gooey heart.  And I loved its pokers style multi-card-trick-taking, mixing many classic card game styles.  It all works rather well surprisingly, however that is not to say it doesn't get a little messy in some places.  For one, I have trouble with the calling "Tichu" bit, it changes the basic mechanic of trying to get points anymore, and turns the game into an "uno" style rusher.  For me this a jarringly rapid change of thought.  Also Tichu is largely based on luck, with good hands dominating, compared to other more balanced card games like Bridge, or Gin.  What Tichu does though is take some elements from the old guys like (a lot of Bridge, and poker), and tries hard to entertain all at once.  It most certainly does, but don't expect it to kill off its predecessors.

I have a weakness for trick-taking games (which this is, nominally), but even so, there's enough of a twist here that the game is full of interesting decisions.  Note, however, that this is a partnership game, and so you are often forced to play the supporting hand (even when you'd rather not).

This and Fairy Tale are both fantastic four player partnership card games.  I like that light cooperative-competitive genre a lot, and I find it is worth owning both of them for variety.

Tichu is much like a trick taking game on the surface, but with a lot of important differences.  

The overall structure is like other games.  You get your cards.  You pass a card to your opponents and your partner.  If you think you have the best hand you call Tichu which means you get extra points for going out first but lose points if you don't make it.  Then everyone those cards in and the final best play takes the pot and any points in it.

The difference it that instead of following card suits you play a set similar to poker hands -- single card, full house, three of kind, etc.  If anyone else wants to play they have to follow that set -- but you can always pass.

And while some cards have point values, the real points come from going out as quickly as possible.

So the fun is analyzing your hand and figuring out how to group up your cards to get rid of them all.  And if your hand is really good, trying to figure out ahead of time if you will be able to go out first.

Added to all this are special cards with special powers as well as the trump-like Bombs which can unexpectedly steal a hand.

Probably had more high fives, excitement, dancing around the table and emotional swings while playing this than any other game I've played. Love it! I love the partnership aspect, the betting on whether you think you will win or not and the many strategic and tactical decisions throughout the game. This was an immediate 10 and I can't see this ever changing.

lots of decisions, and many of them at least seem important.  lots of replay too, but it seems that with an advanced group most of the game is determined by luck.  a common occurence, which can be fine.  the problem i have with it is that i don't find it at all fun when multi-hand/game landslides occur from either side.  maybe playing something like 600 point games would help.  it just takes so long, and the doldrums are getting to be unbearable for me.  but if you mix skill levels, you've got a new and arguably worse problem.  still a highly replayable classic.  i've probably played it for dozens of hours.

Trick-taking 4-player insanity in the core version, I really like the flexibility of this game, with the various playable card sequences and especially the 'special power' cards that really turn it interactive. No surprise that it's so highly regarded, it blows many Western card games out of the water. The variants for multiple player counts also help, and this Rio Grande small box comes with two decks for the larger counts.

Great trick taking card game.  Much tighter and more intense with four.  It's really fun playing a game with partners after all the me against everyone games.  Takes a while to figure out how to play partners.  I'm sure that if I had played a lot of bridge I'd have this down cold.

The little player aids showing the hands are a must.

Ah Tichu.  Tichu is a great way to get your significant other pissed at you.  Or maybe just pissed at me.

Actually Tichu is a wonderful card game played by four people in 2 teams.  It involves trick-taking and shedding and is great fun to play.

Tichu is also a pretty easy game to teach to non-gamers since it has a lot of concepts familiar to heart/spades/bridge as well as poker.

A '90-es évek közepén tanultam egy játékot, sima francia kártyával lehetett játszani, minél több pakli volt, annál több ember játszhatta: "Mocsár" volt a neve. Nagyon hasonlított a Tichu-ra. Nem tudom, ki magyarította, vagy a mocsarat ki vitte ki Kínába. Egy biztos, nekem nem sok újat mutatott ez ajáték. A speciális lapokat leszámítva ugyanez az ütés mechanizmusa a Mocsárban is, az annyiban jobb, hogy ott csak én felelek a sikerért, nem csapatjáték (csapatjátékos típusnak nyilván a Tichu a jobb).

Na újra tichuztam, most nagyon bejött. A múltkor sokat rontott az élményen, hogy ketten kezdőként két haladó ellen játszottunk...

A játék elvileg bármilyen hosszú lehet (kellően rossz bemondásokkal akár 1000 leosztásig is eltarthat), azért ez nem éppen előny:)

I love Pusoy Dos or Dueces which is a different variation of this game so I already knew I was going to like the game.  I ended up really liking this game because of the partnership dynamic and the four special cards that Pusoy Dos does not have.  This is my current favorite 4-player partnership card game.

I have read ridicuously ratings/rants that this game has too much luck and/or not to play against experienced players. I say baloney!. If you dont wont competition and appreciate it, then play "Go Fish"! .Name a game that doesnt ask yourself to make the most of any situation. Also read one rating that said that they'd rather play "Skat". I also am a fan of Skat ( considered the "Chess" of card games)but Skat to me is "Straightforward". Just the "so-called" complicated bidding of Skat is supposed to make it a superior game compared to its actual gameplay is a farx. Tichu is superior in all regards providing all kinds of options and having to adjust and re-adjust. The only losers of this game are the ones thats not patient enough to learn its idiosyncracies!

Very good traditional-style card game. Provides a wide decision space with both tactical and strategic options and requires good cooperation with your partner. The app gets more play than the physical game, as it requires a consistent group of 4 to get the most out of it. It takes a number of games to introduce a new player. The lack of accessibility and requirement of 4 players moves my rating from an 8.5 or an 8 to a 7.5 to 7, based on how much it can get played.

Tichu is awesome - it may well be the most interesting of all the climbing games.  On the negative it sits on the fence between lifestyle and casual game and unless you have a regular group who all love it you might not get to play it that much.  It needs people who like partnership games, can be forgiving, can cope with frustrations and enjoy the tense excitement that Tichu can bring.  They also need to enjoy the subtleties of the scoring system which is a mix of bets, trying to get key tricks, trying to get a 1-2 (you and your partner out before either opponent) and avoiding going out last (tricks dont score).  After poker and bridge this might be my favorite standard card game but need more plays to know for sure.  Its not the most versatile its 4 player only and whilst you could introduce new gamers to it I might try people on clubs, haggis or Franks Zoo first. I do miss the equalising element of everyone starting with 3 jokers/bomb cards in Haggis and the looping structure of Franks Zoo (aces are very awesome in this game as are the special cards).  There is more than enough to make up for this though although you need to be very patient as there will be times where you and your partner are not on the same wavelength and you mess up hands.

The partnership element is great, the luck is strong (it [i]is[/i] a card game) but generally manageable over the course of the game, there is a lot of strategy and interesting decisions to be made (especially for a card game), and it is very replayable. The only things I can find 'wrong' with Tichu are that it can be difficult to understand all the rules, and that it only works for exactly four -- and perhaps that it's highly addictive. Easily the best card game I know. Legendary. (2008-03)

A card game based on a standard deck with 4 extra 'special' cards. Those wishing to avoid paying £10 for a £1.00 ordinary pack should just adapt the two jokers and bridge score cards.

It's a card game, like any well established card game, whist, solo, chase the lady etc etc. It's OK but its just a standard card game. I really do question whether it deserves its own BGG slot above and beyond anything else in the Readers Digest compendium of card games.

Second Play: I can only endorce my previous sentiments and reduce the rating from 5.5 to 4. This is just a twist on a trick taking card game. There is nothing here to make it any different from a standard deck of cards. This does not warrant its own slot on BGG. What is all the fuss about?

Yet another unwilling participant in a agme and this experiemce just gets worse. Yes you can play well or badly but you can only work with the cards you are dealt. There are hands that are unsalvagable and as such this is a game controlled 95% by what you are dealt.

Rating reduced to 2, I really will object to ever playing this again.

RATING: 4.5
I can see why certain people will rate this very high, but I would rather track down some of those CIA camps here in Europe and volunteer for a few hours of white noise than listen to a quick explanation of what is a sensible way to play your hand.

It says a lot about my familiarity with trick-taking partnership games that when people talk about "conventions" for a game I am genuinely surprised that what at first glance appears to be a normal card game with its own set of arbitrary quirky rules, can apparently support its own pro-league and fan gatherings.    

It's not true that I have an inbuilt dislike of card games, or have a special beef with trick taking card games. "Lost Cities" is actually one of the highest ranking games on my list, and having discovered partnership play for that one has opened up a whole new world still. I love 99. When "Mu & Mehr" was first explained to me I completely glazed over, but that certainly had quite a few elements that made me want to learn the game. In my teens I frequently played a Bridge-light variation that I still instinctively prefer over its Big Mama. And "Zoff im Zoo" is another trick-taking one that I play with joy.

This, on the other hand, typifies the very sort of trick-taking card game I strongly dislike. Too many rules that seem to have no inner logic ("a mosquito sting enrages an elephant and makes it count for 2" is the sort of narrative I appreciate), too many arbitrary combos that are or are not allowed (why can I play 2 or 4 but not 3 of the same kind?), a lucky opening hand can set someone up for a gazillion points and there is often sod all you or your partner or even you and your partner can do about it. And why are certain things worth 100 points? Why not 150? And  then there are bombs, or trumps, or parakiets, or whatever, that you have or haven't got and can be another random lucky way to ruin thought out and decent gameplay. For some reason that bothers me a lot more in card games than in boardgames.

At least it left the suit-order intact, otherwise I would have signed up for a whole fortnight at Uncle Sam's pleasure.

I like the simplicity of Zoff im Zoo, and the way some normally weak cards can trump them for obvious reasons. I am still blown away by what Lost Cities has to offer for the few variables it deals with, probably surpassed only by "Geschenkt". I like the gentle incremental bidding in Mu&Mehr, where people slowly reveal information that offer you a whole range of options and how they play out.

To me, decisions about contracts (see, I'm learning card-speak), opening cards, information revealed to partners etc should be a slow and gentle dance with frequent dilemmas. Here someone declares Tichu and whacks three quarter of their hand on the table (two of which were lucky hand-me-downs) and then quickly afterwards get a gazillion points. Big deal.

I probably will play it more often as it is a highly liked game by some in our group, probably discover it is more of a gambling game with small pockets of information than a card game (it has to be if it comes from China), and might even get a bit better at it, gaining a small degree of control. But the moments where clever card play and anticipated dilemmas will keep me thrilled seem for now too thin on the ground. And when I can instantly think of a handful of other, less fiddly and random-rule heavy games that offer that same excitement far more frequently without relying on a lot of chrome to throw in the wackiness, I will have to persuade myself hard not to moan too loud when it gets suggested.

End of rant.

As a card game, it has a high degree of luck involved, but since it is played over many hands, the luck tends to even out, and the more skilled players will tend to do better.

This is a fun little game.  It is good natured and you can have a conversation while playing it.  Good for an afternoon or evening with an even number of friends.

Highly addictive classical card game for four players who play in teams. This game encourages the players to constantly make vital decisions during the game. Easy to learn, hard to master. Two tumbs up!

Tichu es un juego de cartas que tranquilamente podría ser un juego clásico de baraja española o francesa. El objetivo es ser el primero en deshacerte de tu mano y obtener los máximos puntos posibles ganados en la bazas ganadoras en los lances del juego. Juego que se juega por parejas done llevar la iniciativa de la partida, gestionar bien las 4 cartas especiales (bueno tres, ya que una designa al jugador inicial), saber cuándo y cómo debemos bajar nuestras combinaciones, hacen a Tichu simple en planteamiento y difícil en su dominio. Solo he jugado un par de rondas en plan tutorial para sentir el funcionamiento del juego. Extraigo como conclusión que, como el mus o dominó, hay que jugar mucho para concluir si se le odia o se le venera, sin términos medios.

Oh god, this game is going to plague me until I can play it regularly with good players. It's much like a lot of other 'trick-taking' games (that I'm not particularly strong at to start with, though I seem to be improving rapidly). 

I no longer consider the partnership aspect of Tichu to be a weakness, rather I think that it is the game's greatest strength. The partnership aspect makes each game different, adds more necessity for skill and makes Tichu a competitive game, while [GameID=3085] is just a meaty filler.

This game is raising in my esteem almost every time I play it.

This game is on my 'To Review List'. Watch this space.

Undoubtedly [i]the[/i] game for which my taste most changed in the first year or so since I first tried it.

This is the most-owned game in my gaming group, I think.

I can see why some people have a real addiction to this game.  The gameplay is just too similar to Gang of Four for my taste.  I'm not a big fan of climbing games and this one is no exception.  For those who do like climbing games, though, this is probably the best I have played.  The team play makes it much more strategic, and the special cards are a nice addition.

Played once.

Very good first impression, though I'm new to partnership cardgames and felt a bit useless to my partner at times. I can see where this would make a fine social game that nevertheless has a lot of meat on it.

Played many, many more times - all over the lunch hour.

This baby goes over very well. I love the fact that in each game, something wacky happens - something that we just look at each other and go "whoa". (Like the 13-card straight. Yowza!)

It wasn't on my "want to play" list, but I was curious about Tichu.  So, when the chance to play came up I went with it.  Like many trick-taking card games, the cards make a large difference.  We won by a ton and it had a lot to do with luck.  I enjoyed the round, but I won't seek this game out again.

It's a four player game.  Period.  With six it is a torturous exercise in futility because you can't have any strategy since bombs are more numerous than turds in a litter box in a house with six cats.

[b]Update[/b]: I was taught to play with two decks when there are six players. Whoops.  I think playing with just one deck would make the game even longer, which is scary, since there are fewer points each hand...

RATING: 5
My first play was particularly bad, both in the cards drawn and (of course) by my poor play.  I'll freely admit that I am horrible at climbing games and this results in a small hatred of them.  Gang of Four fares no better. 

A second play left a more favourable impression.  Closer score, and though it's still hard to see what to do, I had a lot of fun screwing up.

To me, an ideal game is one that, when you win, you feel like you're the better player, but when you lose you blame your bad luck.  Tichu is the only game I can think of that's the opposite.  You have enough control that when you lose you feel like you screwed up, yet when you win, you're not sure why you did and it could just be the luck of the cards.  That can result in a frustrating experience.

I can see what people here like about the game, since they love stressful decisions and turn angst.  I don't like those things, so I'm not sure whether I actually [i]like[/i] the game, but for the most part I'm OK to play if other people want to.  There are many other games I'd choose to play instead, though, so...

A climbing partnership game.  I really dig this one.  I found that I like climbing games, like Lexio and Haggis.  I also like partnership card games, too.  This one is really good.  Want to play more now. With my near 40 years of card play, this was natural to pick up.  I dislike the Mah Jong card.  I expect this to go up the more I play.

Arguably, the best card game ever.  Bridge, Gin Rummy, even my beloved Euchre now come behind Tichu.  For me it's the wild swings in the game that make it.  Yesterday, we played 12 hands, my team lost every hand but 3, but those three won the game.  Tichu is a thrilling, never give up, sneak attack game that is always a pleasure to play.

Tichu plays really well.  I cannot think of a normal card game I would rather play.  However, it can take a long time.  You must play this game with competent individuals.

It took a number of plays before I finally got to where just about every other round I could consistently call Tichu and gain my partnership massive points.  But now Tichus are thrown around a lot and they often make it, or if they miss the next round has a 300 point swing.

A very cool partnership climbing game.  For the most part, it's Euchre with partners, 4 extra cards and a couple of extra rules, but OMG, those extra cards and rules change the game from bland, stale saltines to crunchy Ritz crackers.  

Watching the other team calling Tichu and going through most of their hand before a short stall drops the lead into your lap and you call Tichu and run the remainder of the hand!  especially if your partner goes out 2nd?!  Absolutely amazing.

Unfortunately, it remains very difficult for me to get it played, but it's one I am always very eager to play.

Good grief! This was the most difficult experience that I have gone through introducing a new game. Complaints about the scoring (with the Phoenix and Dragon) almost took the fun out of playing. I began to see the sense of this game while playing, but by no means do I completely understand the strategy. I hope we will play it again - but this remains to be seen. UPDATE: Played again, and enjoyed it more having a partner that had some experience who could give guidance on the use/play of the special cards. Still not real keen with the card play that includes the four special abilities. Just doesn't offer enough to make it that special.

I always loved partnership card games and this one has quickly become my favorite. It hits the perfect spot, with relatively simple rules and lots of decisions and possibilities to help your partner.

The passing of a card to your teammate adds a nice signaling opportunity. There are different ways to earn points: finishing first (with or without Tichu announced) and points from tricks. Playing until 1000 points will put pressure on the team that is behind and force them to take more risks, that is, announce Tichu and even Grand Tichu more often.

There are of course stronger hands and weaker hands, but with the many possibilities of playing card combinations and especially because of bombs, practically no hand is a guaranteed win. And no hand is so weak that you cannot influence the game with it, you can always help your partner or at least try to prevent the other team from going first and second.

I was a tough convert to this one.  I'm not good at partnership card games, and I could never seem to wrap my head around this one playing online.

After several FTF games, I've gone from abysmal to only moderately bad, and I'm finally learning to enjoy it. I suspect I'll never be a rabid fan, but this game has plenty of  those without me.

Update: made the round of 8 at BGG.con, so I'm promoting myself to halfway decent. And really enjoying it now.

Tichu is a partnership trick-taking/climbing game for four players.  It's a staple of the Penn Gamers, and that's where I learned it.

I loved playing Spades with my family as a kid, so I've always had a soft spot for trick-taking games.  Tichu brings a more gamer-friendly level of strategy and complexity, but is still simple enough to teach almost anyone.  I love it.

Among my favorite card games, and I play lots of card games.

There is an intensity in this game, an intensity that has led to serious cries of "dirty wh*******er" in the middle of a gorgeous and stately bed and breakfast.  The tension is thick, the options myriad, the reliance on partner deep and meaningful.  Why don't I play this game more often???

Been playing this for YEARS, and I still play it whenever I can.  Love it.

Its faults: length (we only play to 500 points); the obscurity of the rules; and its need for exactly 4 players. Otherwise, this game is awesome! Calling (Grand) Tichu transforms this from a hearts/spades variant into something truly special.

UPDATE: Man, this has a steep learning and enthusiasm curve -- I'd say you have to budget in about 30-45 minutes for a few practice games before you start scoring in earnest.

Rather byzantine rules and scoring system, not long just a bit odd and unintuitive; perhaps it gets easier with practice.  Overall I can see that there's skill and, as ever with card games, a healthy portion of luck - I worry whether that is overwhelming but happy to play some more to find out.

I'd really like to enjoy this game more. But the playing time ... often up to two hours! ... really kills it, combined with it being a little overwrought (I should note, it's possible for games to come in at much less than that; 2 hours is probably not typical, but it does happen). Same thing has sapped my interest in Mu recently, and that game is both shorter and, to me, more interesting. I'm not a huge card game guy, they get a little repetitive for me, and I prefer shorter stuff. I'd play this game happily for 30-45 minutes, but the prospect of 90+ minutes keeps me away.

Wasn't expecting to like it a whole bunch, but thought it was pretty good.  That's saying quite a bit since I'm usually not a big fan of card or partnership games!

As with many trick-taking games, a lot is going to depend on whether you're able to get some good hands to play with, but it's always challenging when to risk calling Tichu and how to best play the hand you're dealt.

The partnership aspect is always a bit tricky, as you really have to get to know your partner's tendencies.  Not being in synch on a hand can really blow things up in a bad way!

Tichu may be my favorite trick-taking card game of all time.  The reasons I like it are varied and verbose enough that I won't go into detail here, but I don't think any other game of its type offers the same combination of simplicity of design, depth of play, interesting psychology, and fun.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Who knew that a font existed which could render a standard French set of playing cards near illegible? I've been playing with the numbers one to ten with the court cards all my life, yet somehow the makers of Tichu have chosen a font so hideous that I can have trouble identifying the cards and have an unnatural urge to look away from my cards while playing. Basically the least useable set of cards I have ever encountered.

As to the game itself, it's a little too long what with all of the yo yo ing points, and rounds are only really interesting if a tichu is called. Which is a problem because you can't actually call tichu until you've played the game a number of times in order to be able to identify what a good hand is. You might notice that what I've just described is a huge barrier to entry. The game isn't fun unless you have lots of experience. But to get to that experience you'll have to slog through your least fun games to get there. I already own plenty of fun games for four that are fun right away, there's no need for me to play this one.

I never tire of Tichu. No matter how much I play. Every game of Tichu is exciting and interesting. There's an impressive amount of depth to Tichu - I've played countless games and still don't feel like I've mastered it. Knowing when to call Tichu and how to break up your hand can be very tense, and because there's so many ways to split up your cards while trying to go out fast, take tricks with lots of points, AND support your partner, Tichu gives you a lot to think about. Luck of the draw factors in, of course, but after playing and witnessing countless games I can confidently say that the experienced players always do better. A perfect game.

Update: Our group has been playing this for some 8 years now and it STILL gets play at every single weekly gamenight we have. For eight. Years. If I hadn't rated this a 10 right off the damn bat it certainly would have one now!

I gave this game a hard time in the past.  I think because I didn't and still don't think it as good a game as say Pinochle, Bridge and Spades.  However, this game is much more fun to play as those games.  To make it so, you have to play it with people that make the game fun.  Playing online doesn't do it.  You can play a serious game of Bridge and love it, but with Tichu, it's best side is the turning of the tide in the middle of a hand and the suspense of calling Tichu.  These don't work in a serious game, but are great in a fun environment.  You really have so little information as to where cards are, it is all about playing the luck and percentages.  Making high percentage plays and playing the hand correctly given the situation of Tichu calls.  I like to give my partners grieve in this game to jazz it up a bit, otherwise it is rather dry and shallow.  Arguing about how to play certain situations is an attribute to this game rather than a detriment.  You have to play it with that in mind.  Otherwise, you will find the game lacking in the depth that you would find from Bridge or Pinochle and you will just be bored.

the rules are a little confusing, but the game is pretty simple once you've played it a few times.  Very reminiscent to other asian variety of card games, but with much more depth.  The scoring aspect when done correctly can add a new spin on the way the game is played.  Although it can be played with 3-10 players, I would not recommend the 3 player version.  Played with 4 or 6 people is a blast, because the game really shines when there are even teams.  I haven't tried it with the everyone-for-themselves version, but it looks interesting as well.

I've now played lots of hands thanks to the cool iOS app. I've gone through lots of phases with the game, and my current place is that it's not worth the next step of study and serious play.

RATING: 8
Rated 6 after one play. Ouch. That hurt. I played a learning game and tried to survive at the table with three other players. So, it's hard to rate a game realizing that I spent the time just trying to decipher some sort of strategy. 

A "6" reflects my willingness to try the game. But I can already tell this is better than Euchre, Hearts, 500, Spades, etc. The only question is if I'll play this with enough frequency to get to the level where I can enjoy it.

Update: OK... a 2nd play, and I felt a bit more confident at the table. This is the best game I've played with essentially a standard deck of cards. I still struggle to figure out how to balance claiming the lead with having enough gas to finish out, but that will come with experience.

It's tough... if this plays in 20 minutes or so, then I can be convinced to keep trying this. But, if it takes 45 minutes, then I'd rather be playing stuff like Glory to Rome or other "superfillers." I'll continue to try this one, however.

Update: 3rd play, and I'm bumping this up to a 7. OK, I finally feel like I have a sense of how to freakin' play a hand. I'm learning the strategy, and yes, this is the best basic card game I've played. Count me in for being willing to play this with the right crowd.

Update: It took me less than 24 hours to get in my fourth play. I want to keep playing this game. Having played a ton of card games growing up, there's a bit of nostalgia to busting out a good ol' card game. But this is not your grandmother's card game. This has every bit of strategy that fans of the game reference, and I like it more with each play. There is, however, certainly a barrier to entry.

Update: 10+ plays now, and this is my go-to game for people who like traditional card games. I've indoctrinated some coworkers, and this is turning into our lunchtime game.

I definitely haven't played this enough to even begin to grasp its full strategy.  It's a 4-player partnership trick-taking game, more or less, variants of which are everywhere.

This game took quite a few rounds to get the hang of, but as we progressed learning the game (it was new to everyone) we had more and more fun.  I don't think it will see much play time because of the severe player restraints, but I really enjoyed myself while playing.  Still have some rules questions, though.  Probably much easier to learn by having someone teach you than trying to glean understanding alone.  

UPDATE: The first few times I played this, it was difficult to wrap my head around.  After having some experienced players assist me, though, I feel much more in control of my own destiny.  Now I regard this as one of the best card games I've every played.  Certainly there is a luck element, but the whole process of playing off hands and the different tactics involved are incredibly satisfying.  Someone needs to write a strategy guide.

:indigo: :( :( :( :) Not technically a trick-taking game; apparently it's a climbing game, whatever the hell that is. Tichu is explainable in a few minutes, totally portable, accessible to anyone who's played poker and a game like bridge or spades. There is a non-trivial degree of luck but over a first-to-1000-point game, skill will usually win out. Newcomers are always shy about calling Tichu; they should get over it as this just slows the game down. Tichu is a perfect warm-up or cool-down game for the beginning or end of an evening, but with the right group I could play multiple games back to back.

Best game you can play with a deck of cards (abiet slightly modified). I like the sorting of the hand trying to find the best set of combinations to play the hand out and how it shifts depending on how the rest of the players are playing there hands through the round.

I do use one small variant rule, just like in Euchre if you miss a Tichu call your opponents get 100 pts, while you lose nothing, it keeps the games at a more predictable length, which I like.

Considering that I'm a bit biased against card games, this one is one of the best.

I dig the partnership play. I like that there is some intricacy to the scoring and budgeting the use of your hand strength.

What I don't care for about card games is that each hand is essentially played in isolation. Sure, you are playing to a certain point goal that may cause you to take wilder risks if you trail, but its not like a game where you are trying to rev up an economy, convert influence into gold into points...or otherwise build on each turn as you go. So in that sense, I think card games are a limited return for my gaming time.

All that said, Tichu provides some opportunity for creativity, some bluffing (always good), some teamwork, and plays very fluidly. I don't see myself requesting it...but I think I'd be happy to play anytime someone in the group had a hankering.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The bottom line: this is a really good partnership game and miles beyond the only other climbing game that I've played: Gang of Four. In Tichu the combinations you can play are more rigid (as you have to follow the exact same combination with 5 card plays rather than anything that involves 5 cards), and the deck standard. This makes bombs much less prevalent in this game, but I like the overall system much better in this, particularly because one can make long straights or double/triple pair plays that are almost impossible to follow. The removal of flushes (which are annoyingly common in Gang of Four because of the 3 suited deck) is huge and makes the game much better as well.

The joy in climbing games to me is being able to see the best path to take with your hand, and then following through with it. Tichu also gains points for awarding points to people based on gutsy bidding (calling Tichu) and by helping their partner out when they call it (or hindering the opponent who tries it).

I really like this, and I quickly raised this from an 8 to a 9. This is easily up there with my other favourite card games (Spades, Cosmic Eidex, Doppelkopf) and is among my favourite games period now. It's presently a default game to end sessions with in one of my groups and it has fervent devotees in the other as well. Fantastic stuff.

Aside: Tichu is a 4 player, partnership based game. Though the box says it can scale and rules are included for that no one I know is willing to play the game that way. There are too many games out there that are specifically good for each scale to justify trying to force this one onto the table with anything other than 4.

Aside 2: This is a great cross-over game for people who play stuff like Spades. The rules take a game or two to get a handle on, but this game seems to have legs with almost every card player I know who has tried it. Great potential family and/or game to play while having a few with the guys/girls.

Minor note: When playing with Mary Tomaszewski, be sure to pass her the doge hat wearing, crack smoking dog card, she'll be sure to thank you.

This game has recently grown on me. I think I'm starting to figure this style of game out. This is similar to Gang of Four and all the other get rid of your cards first type of game. Is there a category for that? The game is fun and accomodates up to 6 so its one of the better ones. Maybe even a 7

Thanks Secret Santa 2010! This is an impressive little ladder climbing game which makes you think about your tactics quite a bit. The low number of scoring cards and the presence of the Phoenix (with its negative points) and the Dragon (potential points for your opponents) makesd each trick worthy of careful consideration. Lots here to mull over. I'll be playing this one for a long time. My wife and I just need to train together to become a strong partnership. ;-)

Update: This has now become the game of choice if I ever have 4 players. My step-daughter and her fiancee beg for one of my gaming friends to join us so they can play this. 
Thank you oh angel of angels for this unbirthday gift. On first getting it my step-daughter and I read the rules and played a couple of open hands. That evening we had a visitor, and played three handed (despite being warned against it), and found that the person controlling the dummy hand was winning every hand resoundingly. Although I think it was a lot of luck - the dummy got dealt more bombs than everyone else put together, and twice got virtually lay-down hands to go out - we gave up playing that way. Instead we took out the Hound and all the 2s (the Mah Jong then counted as a 2 instead of 1) and played three handed with no partners. This worked quite well, and was a closely matched game.

I've only played this online, but Tichu is a nice card game in the style of Asshole. However, unlike Asshole, there's a lot of strategy to the game. Unfortunately, if you have fewer than or more than four people, Tichu isn't really an option, which is why I've only been able to play it online.

The ultimate trick taking partnership card game with deep levels of strategy and a steep learning curve.  After learning this game, the classic partnership card games (Spades, Rook, Hearts, and Pinochle)just pale in comparison. I've played about 20 games so far and I'm terrible at Tichu, but I love it nonetheless.  500-1000 games from now, I will probably still love this game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Slowly worked its way up to a 10 after repeated play. And actually it goes to 11. The description would be something like "Addictive like crack. The time played is more than your next top 10 rated games--combined. And not just always *want* to play, but literally... always play". Anyway...

Excellent partnership card game. I'm the type of person who usually enjoys variety of games over getting into a rut with a single game. But this games didn't reach 10 for me (or even 9) after first few plays (unlike some other games that I find instantly enamoring). But really, after playing a dozen or so times, this became infinitely replayable for me. Not just in theory, but in practice.

Update: A thousand or so games later, it's still my only 10. I have have spent a bit too much time thinking about Tichu. I did some extensive data mining of the Tichu logs on BSW. For example: [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/387350/9-million-hands-part-1-grand-calls]this[/url], [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/604836/tichu-trivia]this[/url], [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/402533/9-million-hands-part-2-cards-received-in-pass]this[/url], [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/605480/what-is-the-average-number-of-points-earned-just-f]this[/url], and [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/606162/equity-tables-take-2]this[/url].

First let me say that Tichu is NOT a trick taking game.  Its taken me a long time to really warm up to Tichu.  It will never be my favorite card game - or maybe not even in my top 10 card games.  But what it does, it does very well.  There is scope for clever play. Card counting is rewarded.  Like all card games, bad hands are still bad hands and you learn how to mitigate them until a decent hand comes along.  So for now it exists in the category of a game I'm happy to play with the right mix of people.  It certainly has earned its place in my collection.

Given to me as a gift; unfortunately, upon opening I found it is a weird mix of various trick taking games, poker, and additional complexity of pairing up with another player. All elements on their own I can appreciate to more or lesser extents; combined I draw the line. I'm sure it is a good cardgame, but it's just not my cup of tea. I won't play this game unless forced, and will therefore keep the game unrated.

[b]Update[/b] Games have a way of working themselves onto the table. Tichu proved no exception. I recall my previous statement about it being a good cardgame: it is in fact boring and unpredictable as hell, deriving more enjoyment from the weird non-regular gameplay than it does from clever tricks and stunts. Control is limited, so is guesstimating what others hold, there is no clear way to inform your partner what you are up to or are capable of, and the rules contain really weird and counter-intuitive things. My girlfriend, who has lots of experience with traditional partnership cardgames, proclaimed this game silly and irritating. ’Nuff said, really, I shan’t be playing again.

Oh yeah, before I forget: before writing this comment I searched high and low across the Internets to find out if someone was capable of explaining what is so [i]appealing[/i] about this game. Appealing in the sense that it provides an explanation why some people would play it more than 10.000 times. I read reviews, I read strategy guides, I read comments, and did so in multiple languages. Discounting self-referential answers like ‘Because it’s so addictive!’ and general remarks like ‘Because every game is different!’ (well, duh!) [b]none[/b] of these sources could provide me with a straightforward answer. The game either gets to you, or it doesn’t. In my case, it doesn’t.

interesting trick-taker with partnership and special cards

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Tichu is an enjoyable enough partnership card game of the "climbing" ilk. The special cards are the key element of its appeal; they, plus the passing, add some key tension even before hands begin and allow for some interesting tactical swings. (The downside is that they are unintuitive enough to make teaching this game pretty challenging).

That said, the game's flaws really do bug. Passing decisions are usually of more interest than actually playing out a hand, which is fairly rote and mechanical except for when unexpected bombs muck things up. The game also goes out of its way to value good hands over good play; not only are high cards empirically better than low cards, but the bidding system ensures that an opponent's good hand is extra valuable. And finally, the game simply overstays its welcome; it has the heft of a 45-minute game, but stretches out in some cases past the two-hour mark.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Components: Quality cards with simple, functional graphic design. The 5/10/K cards should have an indication that they are worth points. The specialty cards should have an indication of their powers, and their point value.

Experience: Great take on the 'climbing' genre. This is both more complex (because of the special cards and different card combinations) and more chaotic (because of the special cards and the threat of bombs) than the public domain version I first learned. I enjoy the partnership aspect of it.

Each hand is interesting and tense. And unlike in a trick-taking game like Bridge, where if the opposing team makes their contract there isn't as much tension in playing out the hand, in Tichu just because one opponent goes out first doesn't mean I won't restructure my hand to try to defeat the remaining opponent.

Heart-pounding trick-taking action!!!
I rate this as a 7 when playing to 500. 
Games to 1,000 points take too long, typically. Because of that, I rate it a 5 in that case. 

This game is a pain to teach. Even those familiar with traditional card games have a hard time with this because it adds "weird" cards like the Dragon, Poenix and Dog, as well as because the legal plays are different in this climbing game.

Quite difficult for a card game, though a lot of fun to play. I like the fact that you can play a game in 5 minutes, so you could quit at any time. Though it is more fun to play to 1000 points (the last few games have so much tenstion).

In my opinion, this is the greatest trick taking game there is.  It can be tough to grasp at first--with all the rules of the four special cards, the changing trick combinations, the bombs, and the point system--but casual card gamers can pick this one up quickly.  I have used this several times as a step up for the people I play Euchre with.

After so many years of playing this wonderful card game, I felt like I had to adjust my rating for Tichu. It's just the perfect card game for me whenever there are four people around. It's clever, has a nice depth and the tension while trying to finish your hand to score a Tichu is great.

[First comment]
It´s my favorite four player card game. The only drawback are the somehow difficult to explain rules. At least the people I introduced to the game didn´t like it in the beginning cause they couldn´t really get their heads around the rules. But after a few rounds nearly everyone was a "Tichu-Fan". So, at least in my experience, you have to "force" new players to give this game a try.

I love trick taking and ladder card games. Tichu is an excellent card game and I enjoy it better than Hearts and Spades. Although I enjoy both of those so much, that Tichu isn't too far above them.

The Dog card also introduces some interesting strategies, as well as the dragon card which is basically giving away points to your opponent if you don't play it right, or securing more points for yourself if you do!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
As a four player card game, it doesn't get any better than this.  The luck of the draw is minimized by the partnership aspect of the game and by the wonderful diversity of the possible plays.  The game really grows on you - at first you haven't got a clue what's going on, then you think, "Meh, it's ok, I suppose" and then slowly you realize you always want to play one more game.  Be careful though, the game spreads like a virus and eats other games' time - your group might soon be playing nothing but Tichu.

This is a great card game for gamers, as long as you have exactly 4 players.  If it could scale to more or less players, I would rate it higher.

The (German) rulebook is a mess. We gave this as a gift to some friends for Christmas but ended up having to teach the game to them because they couldn't figure out the rules. 

Once we got it rolling, however, there was a lot of game in those 56 cards. This one requires quite some strategy and card-counting. And there's lots of laughter once the bombs start hitting the table. Plays quick.

RATING: 6
Cerebral trick taking game, played in pairs. A standard deck of cards, plus four special cards (dog, phoenix, dragon, bird) are dealt out. Players play to the current trick, which could be a singleton or a combination of cards ranging from pairs up to straights. Points are scored by taking 5's, 10's, Kings, plus the dragon (+25) and phoenix (-25). Bonus points are awarded for predicting you will go out first, etc. It's more complex than this, with rules regarding the special cards, plus bombs. Well worth playing if you're into card games. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My wife and I enjoy playing Tichu with both family and friends.  The game is a little challenging to teach because it is unlike the typical card games with which most people are familiar.  The rules are not complex, just very different.

Since no two deals are ever the same, Tichu always stays fresh.  At my present skill level, the game is always giving me new strategies to learn and try out, giving me the feeling that I've gotten just a little better every time I finish a game.

I also like the exciting and dramatic moments that happen in every game.  From Tichu and Grand Tichu calls, to super long straights, to multiple full houses, to the unexpected bomb, the game offers a whole lot of variety and surprises, which makes it really fun.

For these reasons, the game hasn't lost its appeal after many plays (only a handful are logged), and probably never will.

My group is totally addicted to this, so I end up turning it down 90% of the time because I prefer more variety.  But it's still my favorite trick-taking-ish game when I'm in the mood.  It helped a lot to have played a lot of Great Dalmuti, so if Tichu seems too complex try mastering that first.

Ridiculously overrated card game. This game only seems a lot more complex and intersting than it is. There are about 10 different leads, and most are unusual and difficult to follow. Chance determines whether you happen to be able to follow an particular lead far more than any amount of skillful play. Similarly, being passed the odd cards to complete a four-of-a-kind is a similarly random.   
    
On the positive side, the four special cards are awesome additions: I would love to see the pheonix/dragon/mah jong/dog cards in other games! And what's absolutely brilliant is the mechanic for divvying up the cards of those who did not play out all their cards. It's too bad that the leads were not as well thought-out as the other, more novel, game mechanics.

This feels like where you go next after playing one-thousand games of Euchre or Bridge.  I can see why people love it so much.  It fits that casual card game niche.  The core rules aren't that hard to grasp, but maybe the deeper strategies need more plays to become clear.  It's best to learn by playing or watching.   You just have to experience it to get a grasp on it.   I liked it, but not to the degree that many other people seem to.  It seems a bit over-rated.  1000 pts seems a bit longer than necessary, we find 500 or 700 works just fine for a family game.

This game is a crude mashup of a handful of actual Chinese card games, which require only a regular deck of cards to play. (What versatility!) The despicable thing about this game is that the cards in this game are depictions of racist caricatures and yellowface stereotypes. It seems like the game developers don't realize or don't care how stupid and rude their product design is, from the nonsensical "Chinese" writing to the slogan that claims hundreds of millions of Chinese people play this excuse of a game.

UPDATE: Has improved on me after more plays and understanding the strategy. It's an interesting alternative to the classic partner trick-taking games like Pinochle, Spades, Euchre. 

This seems like a game that you need to be taught by people who know how to play it. I tried learning it myself and teaching it once and we were pretty lost throughout the game, at least regarding strategy. The rules are pretty straightforward, but the strategy eluded me. Needs more plays to earn as high of a rating as other trick-taking card games I like.

I despise Tichu.  
Don't tend to like traditional card games most of the time anyway, but there are plenty of decent ones I've found something to appreciate in.  This is not one of them.
Tichu is a ladder-style trick-taking game.  Nothing wrong so far.  It opens with a phase where you pass cards to other players, so you have to think carefully about trying not to break up your sets, but also try not to give your opponents something they might really want.  That's ok, but already we're getting into the part of traditional card games I don't like.  This is the card-counting, predicting, move-reading, deduction-y part.  The part where you have to look at your hand and say "OK, I see cards A, B, and D, which means the others have C, E, and F, and this means I have to play like so."  The part where someone else plays a card and you have to deduce "Ah, he led the Hippo.  That must mean he's protecting his crowns."  This sort of strategy completely escapes me for some reason.  I don't think it's bad, but not to my tastes.

But then it gets worse.  Oh, so much worse.  Because there are special cards.  And each one has a special function, and you have to remember what they do.  Ok, so it's some memorization, that's not so bad.  But using them correctly is vital.  And more than special cards, there are special sequences of cards.  These 'bombs' break all the normal rules about what can be played on what and even about when you can play cards.  That's right, this 'simple' trick-taking game has instant-speed nukes!  So then you have to track not only which of your cards are in your normal runs, but which ones are part of a bomb (and there are multiple possible sequences for those).  
And then you try to figure out the scoring, and feel the capillaries in your brain swell.  For you see, you want to take tricks, because they're worth points. But only certain cards are worth points.  So you can win a ton of tricks, but if the cards in them are worthless, you haven't gained anything.  So you want to look out for these cards and collect them.  Except during games played outdoors and days ending in 'y'.  Because what you're [i]really[/i] trying to do is exhaust your hand first.  Those points you get from the cards?  Those are piddly, dirty points; you don't want those.  No, the real points are in calling Tichu! (or if you're really gutsy, Grand Tichu).  So you want to look at your hand and see if you can win tricks in such a sequence that you can be the first to go out and reap the big point reward.

And then, just as I'm about to declare it a hopeless mess, the game goes and commits one more, truly unforgivable sin.  Because Tichu is a partnership game, so you have a teammate.  Now, you've got to pay attention to what your partner is doing, and try and do things like give them good cards, or pass them the lead, and so forth.  But if they make a mistake, you can't do anything about it.  And in a game like this, mistakes are all I can make.
So that's why I will never again play Tichu.  Most games, even if I hate them, I'll play if that's what everyone else wants to do.  But with this one, I'm not only sitting here having a miserable experience, I'm actively harming someone else's enjoyment, and that's unconscionable.

I'm at a loss to explain why this particular title got so popular, and why it's maintained that popularity for so long.

I am not sure there is much point reviewing this as it seems to be known to most gamers I have come across. 

Whilst I liked this climbing card game I would say that there was a lot of luck in its play. I say this as this was my first time and playing against experienced opposition and we thrashed our opponents simply from having great cards round after round.

I would certainly like to play again. Tichu has been built up in my imagination as an amazing card game since it has some major fans out here on BGG. I was actually therefore surprised to find it was quite an easy, intuitive and straightforward game. I am not quite sure why it is SO popular, but maybe I simply have over-hyped expectations and I need to play more to allow the subtleties to reveal themselves.

Tichu is a climbing/shedding game where players are trying to optimally figure out the best way to play their hand of cards to get rid of them all. As usual, the winner of a trick will start the next trick and let them try to set the tempo to their advantage. I haven't played many climbing games (Haggis and Frank's Zoo are the only other ones), but this felt very different due to the four special cards. This one certainly feels deeper than Haggis and Frank's Zoo to me, but it also felt like there was a lot more rules overhead. I think I also preferred in Haggis, that everyone is ensured a bomb, if they want to use their cards that way. It could be that I'm not used to this sort of game and it's painting my opinion of it. I should clarify, that it's not that I dislike the game, just that other kinds of games may be to more of my preference. I'm sure I'll try this one again, but the desire is low because 1000 points seems to be too long for the enjoyment I get out of it.

IMO, The qualities that make Tichu a classic are the four special cards, ability to pass (unlike standard trick-taking games), and the relative infrequency of bombs (compared to the much inferior Gang of Four), all contributing to a high degree of flexibility and creativity when playing each hand.

Rating is based on play after about 1 month.  I have no doubt that it will go UP from here. Edited November 2015. Tichu is a 10.  Every time I play I am dealt a hand that immediately provides me with amazingly fun and interesting choices that I have never had to make before... THAT is success in game design.

RATING: 8
There's a bit of a learning curve here, but lots of subtle decisions on how best to play a hand you're dealt.  An interesting game, and a welcome change of pace from most other trick taking games.  I find myself liking this, Mu, and Four Dragons when I used to stay away from trick taking games religiously...

RATING: 10
My favorite four player card game. Don't like to play it at all online though. That said it's a great time, I wish I had more people to play with on a regular basis. Getting equal skill level players is important too. 

Update: Tichu is my favorite game. I play almost exclusively online, but this is by necessity, not by desire. The only thing that can occasionally bug me about Tichu is your partner breaking the game. I try to ignore that as much as possible, and it doesn't come up much.  No game gets my heart racing (literally) as much as Tichu does. 

After over 100 games and 1000 hands I've developed some different thoughts of Tichu. First of all, my inability to count cards has really prevented me from stepping up to the next level. I can count A's, Phoenix, and Dragon and have absolutely no ability to count from there out. Maybe in 1000 more hands I'll have a better ability of counting. Strategy wise, I think the most important part of Tichu is understanding when to pass weak cards to your P, versus holding strong cards and hoping for a strong card from your P. Additionally, I feel it's beneficial to think of the game as a risk management affair. Understanding when to attempt breaking Tichus, calling Tichus, and taking the lead are all parts of the game that can benefit from this thought process. 

The most therapeutic part of Tichu for me is the luck of the draw. I'm a very, very competitive person, to the point where it can inhibit my enjoyment of social activities and other relationships. I really like Tichu, but I also struggle with the fact that although I think I'm good at Tichu, I'm not going to win every hand. As a matter of fact I'd be extremely lucky to win 55% of the hands, but I honestly think I should win every hand. Hopefully, by continuing to enjoy Tichu I can resolve some of my competitiveness within a few more games of Tichu.

[2 plays] It's hard to talk about Tichu without the comparison to Gang of Four, which seems to be constantly thrust upon you.  When I first played Tichu, I was struck by how much less resemblance there was than I'd heard.  I strongly prefer Gang of Four, which I realize puts me in the minority.  Most people seem to think "Gang of Four is Tichu lite"; I think more like "Tichu is Gang of Four made fiddly."  I do actually like Tichu, and I'm sure I could grow to like it even more with the opportunity for frequent play.  The main thing I don't like about it is that I dislike card games where, rather than the highest-rank cards being worth the most points, there is some other arbitrary assignment of point values.

Es un buen juego de cartas en el cual debemos ser los primeros en quedarnos sin ellas; hay juegos parecidos pero en éste se aportan unas cartas especiales que hacen más divertido el juego y además está¡ lo de marcarse un Tichu o un Super-Tichu(como nosotros llamamos) que consisten en advertir a los contrarios y a tus compañeros de equipo de que vas a ser el primero en descartarte de todas y si lo haces tienes un bonus, pero sino tienes una penalización.
Para ganar, es muy importante jugar en equipo y aprovechar tus ocasiones de Tichu e intentar desvaratar los Tichus de los rivales.

A huge thank you to Danny Mack for this gift!

Very high-rated climbing game, can be played with regular deck and four marked jokers.  Apparently far superior to Gang of Four.  Best enjoyed as a four-player partnership, many regard it as "the best four player partnership card game ever." Worth trying some time!  See the teaching video here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/404463

We actually have 3 editions of this game:

 Tichu - Abacus edition 2004 (2004) |	 English, French, German

and 

Fata Morgana Swiss tin box (2008) |	 German

Then, on top of that we have multiple copies of each edition. Why? 

BECAUSE THIS IS THE BEST CARD GAME EVER. 
EVERYONE IN OUR GAME GROUP MUST KNOW HOW TO PLAY IT or ELSE. 

Probably the only must-play game for every game session that we either host or attend, and that's been in various states. Really. It's that awesome.

I've played more games of this than I recorded on BGG and will play on occasion but the bloom is off the rose. My new theory on Tichu is: 40% of your hands are such crap that all you can do is pass your best card to your partner and hope they can do something; 40% are so good the best you can do is not screw it up; and 20% require smart play to be effective. Among equal players and equal card distributions, that 20% is what you're really playing. I dropped the rating as a result. I still think it's a good game but not quite as good as I used to.

If I can get 2 pairs of players and run this for an evening I'd be happy.  As it is, by far the most plays I have of this come from BSW - and it is briliant.  Line up those combinations in your head, call Tichu, and pray they didn't pick up a bomb. :D

Played the Nanking version.  I generally like trick-taking card games and this is familiar enough.  However the Bomb aspect is still not all that appealing to me as much of the idea behind that favors getting the right cards and not the decision on what to play.  When to play them remains a choice and I reckon that experience shows when the right time comes up, but not having a bomb has nothing to do with experience and all with the luck of the draw.  The scoring is interesting and I would play this again, especially since this is one of the most popular games on BSW.  But given a choice of all trick-taking games, I would pick others before this.  Tarot being the top in that category for me.

[4 plays] As usual, a partnership game brings many interesting elements to the table, but I think the four simple cards added to a standard deck really create a lot more texture.

I don't think my rating is going to go up, but I expect I will never tire of this game.

I suck at this game, but I love it. 

I've played versions of this game before: Scum/ A-hole, Big 2 (Chinese Cho Dai Di - usually played for money) etc so it's not completely new, but the partnership and scoring (betting that you will go out first) adds an element to the game that is new to me and much, much more interesting. 

Definitely will need to play more and get better. Just need 2 more people my husband and I can play against.

Egy alap felülötős franciakártya-játék némi bonyolítással. Nem csak lapokat lehet kijátszani, hanem pokerből ismert kombinációkat is. A kombinációkat, csak ugyanolyan, de nagyobb kombinációval lehet felülütni. Ezen kívül van négy spéci kártya, amikkel hívást lehet átadni, vagy éppen bármit felül lehet velük ütni. Ja és mindezt négyesben kell játszani, parban. 

Elsőre úgy kaptunk ki, hogy közünk nem volt a játékhoz, ez kicsit elvette e kedvem, de azért szívesen kipróbálom még párszor, bár véleményem szerint alap (magyar/francia) paklival is vannak legalább ilyen jó játékok. Pl. ulti.

Holy shit did this bomb with my dad...I thought it was a sure thing, being a mix of Poker, Dalmuti, and Rook.

Have to find a group for this.  There seems to be a lot to like but if I gots no one to play it with, I gots no one to play it with.  Which might say something to me about how it appeals to part of its intended audience.


EDIT:  I have found that of those gamers who are really into this game, they're generally not my style of gamers.  I guess that means this one's an odd duck for me; I like it okay, but I really do have no one that I'd actually enjoy playing it with.

So I bought a Chinese card game in Australia to find the instructions are only in German - yet to be seriously played (10/1/10).  UPDATE: It would be unlikely I would play this in the flesh (cannot see how I might find three other interested people), but playing this on the iPad / iPhone has shown me what a great card game it is.  Rating (7) is not higher purely is because I have not actual confirmed if the real world is as good as the electronic! (21/5/12). UPDATE: I'm resigned to the fact I will never play this in real world (15/9/12). UPDATE Still kept for some reason (Rating 6.684 Jan 17)

I like the flow and some of the ideas in Tichu, but there are much better, more interesting, more modern card games than this one. I don't really understand the foaming-at-the-mouth fervour that some fans fall under for this one. It's just... okay. A regular trick-taking game with a few special cards and risk-taking mechanics. Has some neat ideas as trick-taking games go. But honestly, I haven't yet played a trick-taking game that I've loved. Maybe the genre just doesn't wow me. It still feels like too much of it depends on the cards you're initially dealt. Of course, you have to know how to play, but after that point... what's the point?

We've been playing weekly and my skill is increasing! With experience I can judge what will win a trick and what won't. Now it's time to learn the finer points of the game, like do I hold onto cards hoping to get a bomb or do I give them away to ensure my opponents don't have one; or how do I change my play according to the points on the table.

From the description alone I didn't think I'd like it, but I figured I'd give it a shot. Dozens of plays later, I think it very well be my all-time favorite game. This is thus far the only game I've bought a second copy of because my first copy was getting so worn.

RATING: 7
With only a couple plays I have tentively rated Tichu a 7.  I see room for a rise in my score because this title does offer fun decisions for a hand management, set collection game.  I also enjoy the games team play which enhances the decision making with every play.  Yes, the cards dictate your play, but becoming aware of your probabilities and by therefore hindering your opponents while helping yourself and your partner make Tichu anything but luck driven.  The luck in this game will even out before it's end and more often than not the team with the stronger players will be victorious.

Becky is an a$$hole (for you iOS users).

I played Euchre for the first time in a long time in Summer '09 and didn't like it at all.  I see no reason to play it ever again after learning Tichu.  I thought Tichu would be OK, but had no idea just how good of a game this is.

I've heard about this game in a gameshop for the first time. I just wanted to buy a game which is small, possibly made for 2-4 persons and famous.
The shopkeeper offered me this. "It's an amazing card game, if you like poker, you will enjoy this also" - he explained.
No doubt about it, this is a fantastic game, where you have to cooperate with your partner, in order to win.
Poker has 52 cards, but this game has 4 "bonus" cards, which is the meaning of this game.

The oddball scoring of the special cards leads to some interesting strategic puzzles.  Still wrapping my head around how to play well as a team.

On the downside, it can be frustrating to have a great hand which turns out to be almost useless without the necessary initiative.  It seems like 500, my go-to trick-taking game, offers more opportunities for stealing initiative from the opponents.

Without a doubt my favorite card game. I enjoy the trick taking element that adds a form of bidding and team strategy. In addition to the highest card winning, smaller cards become powerful when their specific combination cannot be followed making almost any hand a potential threat.

There are only four card games in my book: bridge, mus, tichu and tarot. I dont play the latter any more since many years ago. Bridge is my favourite game but it takes years to become good enough to play it in tournaments and is extremelly difficult to find rivals in Spain. Mus, on the other hand, is a funny and fine game that is the best card game with spanish deck. But in this case is difficult to find players out of Spaın. And then I have Tichu, an exciting game of tricks that works flawlessly, perfectly, easy to learn but with a lot of room for tactics, a game that normally the better players win. Portable, thrilling, demandindg while accesible to learn... you cant be wrong with this one...

RATING: 9
Components: good quality of the cards
Complex: not hard to learn, hard to master
Weight: light to medium
Players: 4
Length: around 1 hour
Mechanics: trick tracking, partnerships
Decisions: a lot, what to play, should I go for this trick or wait, what my mate needs
Opinion: one of the best card games over there. Trick tracking game where you need to play all of your cards before the others (nothing new here), but the way you do that (lone card, pair, three of a kind, full house, consecutive pairs, stair) and the information you are revealing during the round is amazing.
You are not only playing to rid off of your cards, but to help your mate and mess with opponents, keeping an eye on the information you receive from your mate and... the POINTS!!!! oh, the points. This is something really hard to master, as I always say to people learning the game... forget the points, you will try to learn and manage them once you know well the game.
A game I could play at every hour, and my favorite card game (taking apart the traditional card games like mus)

Update 06/16:

After almost a year playing Skat I can say that it surpasses Tichu in terms of depth and long-term interest. Both games are equally addictive. I haven't had the chance to play Skat in person to offer a fair comparison in that sense, but I can say that is a more tight, less luck-driven game, therefore raking higher on my list.

Both games are my absolute go-to card games though, suitable for different occasions. Tichu is much more accessible than Skat, especially for players with any Poker background, so I suspect it will get many more live plays over the years.

Update 04/13: 

- The most fun I've ever had playing cards;
- The most addictive card game I've played;
- It only gets better with time;
- Could play this every day;
- Enjoyable by gamers and non-gamers alike, even when playing together;
- Minimal and cheap components;

As far as card games go, this is a 10.

------------------
(07/12): I saw its potential since the beginning, but it took me the right group to get addicted to this. Clever mix of other climbing games. What makes this one great are the four special cards and the partnerships. 

This is the kind of game that, once you find 3 (or 5) great players to play with, you simply cannot stop playing until after bedtime, no matter how early you start. I've never experienced any game like this in this regard.

P.S.: I also recommend Tichu with 6 players. A completely different game, but very enjoyable nevertheless.

I don't really like trick taking/climbing games.  I don't hate them either, so pretty much all of them get a 6 from me because I don't have enough expertise in what makes quality.  In general, I don't like competitive team based games i.e. I like co-ops or even asymmetrical games a la Fury of Dracula or Betrayal at House on the Hill, but not equal team versus equal team.  I don't like the feeling of depending on another player without the capacity of direct communication.

Sadly, it took an ipad app to finally get me well acquainted with this gem. What a partnership game!

Despite its popularity, I didn't find this fun at all. This whole genre of trick-taking is hard to get into if you're not playing with people who share a similar experience level with the game. Plus, there's a lot of terminology that you need to know in order to communicate to your partner.

But this one is incredibly popular and I'd like to know why, so I must give this a second chance.

I do enjoy a good card game sometimes and this seems to be one of the best. I've only played it 4-player but I think that is the best number from the sounds of it. Some great agonising decisions over whether to call Tichu or Grand Tichu/what to play/when to play/when to try to pass the lead etc. So far we haven't come close to the stated 30-90 minutes per game but I'm sure that the time will come down the more we play.

I have played more than 5.000 rounds on www.brettspielwelt.de, plus many more offline rounds with friends and family. I love it since many years and it has not stopped fascinating me. I think i am good at this, but i am still learning :)

If you do not outright hate cardgames, give it a try. If you like Doppelkopf (Double Sheepshead), let me tell you that this is better. It has more variety and more tatctical decisions per round. Thumbs up for my all-time favourite cardgame!

Initial rating of an 8 based on two plays.  Very fun, lots of strategy to figure out -- and different strategy than most other trick-taking games I've played.  Art-work is goofy but fun.  $12 is a bit much to spend on two four-joker decks of cards, but you'll have a hard time spending $12 on a better game, so I can't really complain.

Further plays have borne out my initial impressions.  Not as deep or interesting as Bridge, but very fun and much more accessible.

This actually is very good.  One of the best traditional card games the doesn't require money to change hands to be fun.  Its a trick taking game like hearts or spades, with a number of extra rules that make things more interesting and creative.

UPDATE:  Playing it on your phone means you don't need exactly four people, you don't have to shuffle or organize your hand, and you can play it anywhere.  Those criteria bump this up a lot in my opinion, its way fun on your phone.

Only one play, so it's possible I just haven't seen the light yet. It's awfully long for how much is going on here. You make the decision about whether to call tichu or not and that is the primary source of points. However, this is an all or nothing decision. Compared to something like Bridge or 500 Euchre, this seems simplistic. Then, you have to play out the hand. The decisions now revolve around whether or not to split up groups of cards and in what way. It feels a bit like Rummikub or something. My more favorite card games generally revolve around deciding whether to top what is on the table already, which is much more interesting to me. Granted, there is a bit of this, but I spent more time shuffling cards around in my hand and seeing what my options were. It's not bad, and I'd like to play again, but I don't see this unseating the true trick-taking games as my card games of choice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fun game but the partner setup drags it down some as you need to make sure everyone understands the different 'meanings' of the things you pass. Has a huge amount of depth after that but the hump of getting everyone familiar with the passing makes it rough to introduce. Can't really skip that or else the game is very unbalanced if the other pair even marginally knows what they're doing.

Wow, what a game. Having never really played traditional card games (trick taking, poker, etc.) and playing quite a few rounds of this only one time, my mind is buzzing thinking about his game. It is particularly wonderful for forcing interaction among players. The most fun I had was trying to figure what would best help my partner. I look forward to playing this one more. By the way I was taught the basics of this game in waaaay less than twenty minutes by Dave Arnott and he had a disadvantage in that I know nothing about card games like this.

[Initial Impression: 7]
Tichu is a strategic partnership and hand-management game for exactly 4 players.  It involves a regular deck of cards plus 4 special cards.  There are many types of hands that you can play (all loosely based off of poker hands), and each player must play the same, but higher, type of hand as was started on that turn.  If unable to do so, a player must pass.  The real meat of the game comes in calling "Tichu" or "Grand Tichu", both of which involve boldly predicting that you will be the first to play out all of your cards.  If successful in exhausting your hand first, big points can be scored.  For people who enjoy trick-taking games (Rook, Spades, Hearts, etc.), Tichu will become a quick and possibly addictive favorite.  Yes, as with any card game, there is a large luck factor in what cards you draw, but there is also some heavy strategy in planning out how to organize those cards into hands and when (or if) to interrupt that plan in response to another's play - all with the goal of best completing your Tichu or stopping another's Tichu call.  There's a lot of tension and a sensation of high stakes - players will sometimes pause for quite a while, and you can practically see the gears turning in their minds as they adjust their suddenly not-so-perfect plan.  It is also a game that rewards experience with the same partner.  As I've gotten better at the game, I've really begun to tire of it and will even refuse games now, but that is primarily because it so frequently hits the table.

[My "Grand Tichu" Success Counter = 2 (of 4)!]

Interesting to play in cooperation with your parner. The rules are quite easy, but the choices you have to make sometimes can be really deep. If you are capable of remembering the cards that went out, you can have high advantage. I usually play this as a warmup or filler game, because its playtime is super low. The four special cards are welcome these  makes strategy possibilities wider. 

Pros / Cons:
-Every game is different, or very rarely the same so its high on replay ability.
-Very good price/value it costs just a few bucks, but you can play it till you die.
-Fast gameplay, with almost no downtime at all.

-The artwork looks awful and the theme feels too dry.
-Only 4 players can play, no option to play at other player count.
-Sometimes the luck of the card dealing can determinate the winner without any chance of stopping that happen.

I thought I would like this game.  I like Spades, and hearts, but I just could not get to like Tichu!  I think that the large sets and special cards made it a little too random for my tastes.  My general feeling is that card games get enough randomizing from shuffling the cards.

I love trick taking games. I'm a big fan of hearts.

This is a trick taking game on the BGG top 100 so I expected good things. It's ok... there are some clever teamworking bits and I can see there is a lot of skill and tactics in it.

But it doesn't wow me. I'm not sure I like the poker style hands or the fact that bombs can be played out of turn.

Is it [i]Whist[/i] on steroids?  [i]Poker[/i] on Ketamine?  [i]UNO[/i] on HGH wrung from the livers of Third World children?

[i]No.[/i]

[i]Tichu[/i] is the stretch Hummer full of coked-out hookers of card games.  It's just plain nuts and makes my scrotum tingle with that "gotta-gamble" feeling.

And the best part is:  YOU CAN PLAY IT WITH A STANDARD DECK.  Just buy two decks, strip the jokers out of one and ditch the other 52, scrawl on them jokers with a Sharpie and you're good to go.  [i]Tichu[/i] anywhere, anytime.  No proprietary deck needed!

PS.  The 6p game blows, and not in the good way.  You don't get enough cards to build anything competitive—and chances are, you'll get a fistful of crap and sit in the stink watching everyone else play.  This really, [i]really[/i] wants to be a 4p-only game.

PPS.  The top end is kind of flat.  There's the initial learning curve of figuring out what the hell "good play" is, then there's figuring out how to pull off a Tichu and a Grand, and then there's mastering good partner play (to go out 1-2).  Beyond that—well, things just kind of flatten out and the decision space you arrive in is a lot smaller than the one you imagined while hacking your way upward to the top of [i]Tichu[/i] Mountain.  It ends up like this:  Once you've mastered all the preceding problems, the game just comes down to 

1) Getting good cards, and 

2) Not blowing it with bone-headed play.  

And that's... just about it.  There's very little you can do with a crap hand; there's really no such thing as clever defensive play with a fistful of junk.  You just get to sit and take it in the face like a pornstar.  I used to rate this game a 10 as I was making my way up...  Now that I've topped out it's really an 8.  It's still a great game—it's just that the luck/skill ratio is out of whack such that skill cannot overcome bad luck.

Here's our copy of the 2004 edition that came with one Tichu deck and one not-Tichu deck:

I love playing this card game. While there is some luck involved in the deal, there is a lot of skill involved too (over the long run). I prefer this trick taking game over any other

EDIT: I am upgrading this game to a 10 because it is so addicting that we now play it every week at our game group in Hollywood. We play our traditional board games at the Cafe and follow with 2-3 hours of Tichu at the Thai Restaurant next door. Used to have trouble finding players, now we have enough for two games at a time. I am thinking ofr starting a special TICHU game group in the Los Angeles area.

RATING: 8
Tichu is fun enough but I can't say that it is significantly better than the other 5-million card games out there. Playing to the full 1,000 points generally takes longer than I'm willing to spend on a card game; if I have 90 minutes for gaming I'd rather play lots of other things. That said, you can stop the game after any hand and just call it over which is what we do when we play it during our lunch breaks. Also, having to pay $30 (Australian) for a normal deck of cards with 4 jokers is annoying.

[Note: I've played this waaaay more than 13 times but I've stopped trying to update the counter. I play this at work during lunch at least 3 times a week.]

My favourite card game. It has it all: thought, fun, tension. There are wild swings of fortune and astonishing comebacks. Don't be put off by the rather tacky proprietary cards that you have to buy in order to play, this really is a good game. Sequences and Steps don't have to be same-suit, so multi-card powerplays are common and hard to follow, with little actual 'climbing' going on. Much of the rest of the game then consists of burning off your single cards with the Dragon and the Phoenix cleverly added to the deck to determine the winners. Beginners tend to be very tentative about betting, so play to 500 for the first few games. You get the occasional 'blowout' game where one team repeatedly calls and makes Tichu, but mostly the distribution of good and bad hands is pretty fair, leading to tight scoring and genuinely thrilling play.

Potentially, very funny.  Communicating with your partner is key, but quite tricky, since it is mostly done by passing cards and calling Tichu.  Great late-night or in-between game with a fair amount of depth. Can probably be played more seriously--but that isn't how I want to play it :-) (2 plays)

First played this on Feb 27th, 2007.  The rules are a little overwhelming, however it's worth it.  Having an understanding of trick taking games will help.  It's something I'd recommend playing every once in a while to mix things up.  The game itself is unique enough where you will have to work out strategies all over.  You will also have to play the game at least once before you have an idea of how to play.  After that you might get hooked.  There is a lot of luck of the draw in this game as well.

Some plays are from the Android App but most plays cumulated in 2017. This game is a total blast for me. I love the tactical aspect and that you really have to play together to get many points. It's a great game to learn giving up on your own tricks to strengthen your partner. "Selflessness" is quite uncommon in boardgaming :)

I've only played 1 complete game.  I agree it's good, but I'm not yet enamored like the rest of BGG.

I can't really put my finger on it.  Maybe it was just a little too much to take in for a single play.  I'm more than willing to give it another go.

In the meantime, I've got to rank 99 or Hearts or other card games slightly higher.

May09: Okay, the more I play it the more I like it.  We play it at lunch some now without the 4 special cards.  I actually enjoy it that way even more.  It's focused more on forming your hand into the most efficient melds you can while still breaking it up to steal the lead.

I think the best part is just the sheer number of options you have each turn.  Standard trick taking games are very limited in what you can play.  In Tichu, the sky is the limit most of the time.

I also like the Tichu scoring the best of all the climbing games.  Having the 5-10-K worth points and the last player not getting their cards gives a great incentive structure.  And the "Tichu" wager is just that addicting.

Sep09:  Alright, 30ish play laters I'll bump it to a 10.  I still want to play it and suspect I'll go on wanting to play it.

I'm not saying it's the best card game out there, but I am saying its *among* the best.

A more advanced, partnership version of the Presidents and Asshole drinking game you played in college. It does just enough to reduce the randomess where you still feel like you can win any given hand, but over the long run the better set of players win. Then again, given how much I love Euchre, clearly a luck-based partnership game doesn't bother me.

In high school we played a game call A****** that I loved, but which only had meaningful decisions if you played with certain variants -- and everyone I knew seemed to prefer different variants. Hard to describe my delight in years later finding this game that takes the concept and develops it into one of the best card games I've ever played. 

Only downsides are that it requires exactly 4 players and is really intimidating to new players, both because of some rules complexity and the whole "oh no my partner will be pissed if I screw this hand up" worry. 

Check out Haggis and Clubs for two other excellent games in this genre.

I played a lot of card games when I was younger. I loved scum, and played heads of 500 and Black Bitch at Uni. Nowadays I would definitely prefer playing a board game to a card game. Truth be told that was true then too. I prefer the development and strategy and the actual board. 

So what makes Tichu stand out as a card game that I want to play, and would play over a board game reasonably frequently. I'm not sure, I like the partnership aspect, and I like the puzzle aspect of figuring out how to play out your hand. There is definitely strategies and each new hand different during a game.

It is easily the best card game ever. Hands down. Also getting a Grand Tichu is just awesome.

Very nice card game.  It has a feeling of classic card games (like bridge etc.), but it has its own flavour and character (e.g. there are special cards like dog or dragon in it).

Although not the greatest card game in the world, it is quite addictive and no wonder hundreds of milions of Chinese play it every day :-))

EDIT: Sadly, the game's charm faded quite a bit for me and it's not so much fun as it used to be :-| (rating down to 6.5).

Sold.

A complete rip-off/updating of Gang of Four, Big Two and other Chinese Public domain games going by the dates, unless I am missing something.

Now that that is out of the way and I can't believe no one else mentioned it, this is essentially a partnership version of GOF which adds to the game nicely along with the special cards. There are some other slight differences too and I do miss not being able to play a flush but this is a direct derivative with slight but definite improvements, this coupled with the partnership aspect does give you a little more to think about here but not really deeper per se. 

Things to think about: 

 - 200 point bonus if you and your partner go out first (maybe it should be 100?).

 - Trying to get the 25 point bonus while avoiding the 25 point penalty card

 - When to call a Tichu or Grand Tichu. 

They don't sound like much but there is a lot of skill in all this and they are all improvements over GOF IMO. I also think the partnership aspect helps to mitigate the luck which is a great thing too.

Speaking of Tichu's it feels a little like Spades even in the partnership aspect although it is easier to help your partner or hurt your opponents in that game which is why it is so good. Here the "Tichu" is very much like the "Nil" in Spades and "Grand Tichu" is very much like the "Double Nil" in Spades. You are going out on a limb saying you will go out first upping the stakes, a great option in both games and can skillfully be pulled off with the right hand. 

Certainly addicting and right up there with Spades, Bridge and Schafkopf (Sheepshead) for me as the best meaty card games
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Tichu is a game that will feel strange to most people the first time they play it, but it is not super hard to learn.  Once they play through a few hands they will understand how it works.  The biggest positive here is the fun factor that comes from bombs and the tenseness of trying to go tichu or even grand tichu.

People who enjoy spades should really look into tichu.  This is really a wonderful partnership trick-taking card game.  If you don't have the actual tichu deck don't let that stop you.  Grab four jokers and mark them as the special cards and mix them into a standard 52 card deck.

This one was a lot of fun, I played a simpler ladder climbing game that used a standard deck of cards a lot in high school, so this was something I had a good amount of context for, but there's a good amount more thinking to this one which I like. Unlike bridge for example, which I played a bunch recently with friends, it's a game that you can sit down and start playing right away and have fun with rather than having to worry about all sorts of bidding conventions and memorizing flowcharts. Although it also seems like a game that you can get very good at and that rewards skill enough of the time. It's still a card game after all and so sometimes you can just get great hands, but it's fine because you can play a round very quickly and so you just play for a while and it'll even out.

My first play experience of this game was not very good. My partner and I lost, I kept confusing the special ability cards for each other, and I kept getting explanations as to why my plays were bad that I did not understand.

I keep saying that I'm going to play this.  Then I read the rulebook again, get confused, and put it back in the closet.

How is it that I can grok 18xx and wargame rulebooks, but this one just leaves me lost?

---- 
Having finally played this a couple of times, it turns out that the rules are simple.  The rule book in the Abacus version, however, is god awful. It spends more time on the fake "ancient Chinese secret" aspect of the game than it does on clear instructions of how to play.

The Rio Grande Games version has a much improved rule book.  Also, for reasons unknown, Abacus went super cheap on their set. The 2nd deck of cards is just a regular 52 card deck.  The four special Tichu cards are missing.  Rio Grande supplies two complete decks in their set.

== 
Short version.
The Abacus version is inferior to the Rio Grande version.

I kept thinking I wanted to get this game, but it's not often that I have exactly 4 at the table who want to play it.  I did finally get it, but my copy doesn't come out that often.  CABS has multiple copies in its library, so when I do play we usually play a library copy.  I could see this being a great game for a regular group of 4 to pull out over and over again.  It lasts longer than you think it will, though, so we have a lot of aborted games.  By the way, if you're thinking of getting it, you absolutely should hold out for the new printing (in 2008) by Rio Grande Games.  It has two complete Tichu decks, whereas the old version has one Tichu deck and one Tichu-suited regular deck.

Traditional card games like this are normally not my cup of tea. At all. :-)

But I must say that for a traditional card game I found Tichu quite enjoyable and I suspect that the special cards and the exotic flair they represent are a big factor in this. It's too long for my tastes, however, and I would prefer it to be playable in an hour or less.

Not a game I will clamor to play, but I suspect that if in the right mood, I might enjoy an occasional game of Tichu.

I love trick taking card games, however, I didn’t get Tichu`s reputation in my only play (It was kind of boring). I know I need to play it again to properly rate and comment, but every chance I had had to play Tichu I have decided to play something else. 

I know I have to give this another chance but for now I’m downgrading its rating to one that properly matches my feelings toward the game today (overrated). I really hope I can get to like this game in the future as the premise of the game (partnerships) seems great.  For now I prefer to play  Bottle´s Imp, Wizard, and Haggis over Tichu.

I didn’t knew I would play again so soon after my last comment, however I did and I enjoyed the game. This definitively has potential. It seems the game has a lot of depth and the partnerships adds the, defining, differentiating and most important factor. I still prefer to play Haggis but this could go up in my ratings. Now I want to play again.

There's more strategy in this game than it might seem on first glance, and knowing when to call (Grand) Tichu is a real skill.  As all card games with random deals, can get frustrating during an extended sequence of bad hands.

It's made the 'Top 20' in games played at our Club for the past few years and its popularity shows no signs of slowing down.  Well deserving of an '8' rating.

Starting player plays a poker hand and other players try to follow with same type, but higher. Four special cards help. Phoenix is wild, dragon beats all, dog jumps turn to partner, and mah-jong starts plus allows you to wish for card. 5s, 10s, and Ks (10) score with -25 for phoenix and 25 for dragon. Note with dragon win hand goes to other team. Call Tichu if think will go out first.

Good solid filler partnership card game. A better version of Bridge to my mind - it's superior in every way. If you like Bridge, you'll almost certainly like Tichu. And if you have a thing for Mah Jong too, this will float your boat.

One thing I love about this game is in finding the ways to play your hand.  You&#039;re playing multiple cards to the table at any time, and there are typically conflicting ways to organize your hand in a way to maximize its effectiveness.  It&#039;s one of the most popular games in our group, and always feels fresh.

It's kind of silly to have a special deck for this game. It's a standard deck of cards with four jokers.

This is fun. It's a trick taking game mixed with a hand-emptying element. The end result is like hearts, with a little more room for creativity and less card counting.

Update: I'm done with this game. I'd rather play Pinochle. (I like Pinochle.)

A great partnership card game (not a large genre, I'll admit). The main problem is that it seems to take a fair while for people to actually get comfortable enough with the game to play well, so for at least with new players Tichu really needs to be the main course, not the filler. 

And it's hard to sell a climbing card game as a main course...

Initial rating 5/2007: It's starting to make more sense, but I still haven't had that "Aha!" moment yet with Tichu.  Hopefully with sustained play I can explore the game more, as the few plays I have so far have not been the greatest.  It can be kind of difficult to explain to other players, especially since I have never played before.  Hopefully as I learn how to play I can get others to join in.

Update 12/10: Finally this year I have had some success getting others to play the game, especially my wife.  The iPhone app has helped us to cement our understanding of the rules as well as improve in strategy.  The more experience I gain the more enjoyable I find the game.  At this point the main thing keeping this from a 10 is the play time - if it could be shorter I would move it up.  Up from a 7 to a 9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A back up for our other set.  This one seems way better since there are two decks in the box.  It seems really stupid of the Abacus edition to have two decks but only one of them with the 4 special cards.  I know there are other games you can play with the cards, but who really plays anything else other than the main game?

One of those card games which seems familiar to everyone because its a variant of an older card game that everyone remembers playing. The partnership aspect was cool, but quite frankly, you could recreate this game from a standard deck of cards. [Updated] The six-player game is not bad. This game played much better the second time round.

The biggest drawback of this game is that it needs four players to be played. However this is quite an embracing game with several annoying rules. The worst of them is the switching of the cards before the play. Of course, the game would be different without it.

For what is essentially a poker deck game, it's really deep and exciting. There's real tension, real planning and shifting of plans in response to other players' actions as the game progresses. Its only downside is that it requires four players. That and how long it takes to explain before you can get a game going. Still, I love Tichu and I'll always say yes to a game.

Szerintem ez tipikusan az a játék, amit fix társasággal kell játszani, és úgy, hogy közben más társasjáték nem kerül elő. Érzem, hogy sok finomság van benne, rengeteget lehet fejlődni, de ez nem az én játékom. Nem mondanék nemet rá, de pl. szerintem ezt marhára frusztráló lehet különböző tudás-, tapasztalatszintű partnerekkel játszani. A kultuszt, ami körüllengi a Tichut nem különösebben értem, de azért azt látom, hogy jó játék. Mondjuk a szabályok nem túl elegánsak...

Awesome! This game allows you so much flexibility, each hand is a gem of a game by itself. The impact of a bad draw is considerably lessened by the options you have about how you organize your hand and when you choose to play your cards. The 4 special cards, bombs, calling Tichu -- all add flavor and lead to great variety in gameplay possibilities. You gotta love a game that lets you make a tremendous comeback when you're way behind, too. If it took a little less time to teach to newcomers, I'd insist on rating it 11.

Sad note: I had this as my lone 10 for years, but I have had to knock it down a half-point. This is not an easy game for a newbie to play well. If of your four players, there is one who does not understand that you can't play all your high cards first (and therefore never goes out) or who just never calls Tichu, it really handicaps his team. That might have knocked it down more than 1/2 point, but I love Tichu too much to rate it less than 9.5.

I've yet to meet a Tichu player who wasn't such a fan of this game as to come off as a total a$$ to anyone who didn't think the same of it.  It's not really my thing because I find climbing and trick-taking style games all so very basic.  Sure I believe you that there is a lot of depth and strategy to this game but I also have that in more thematic card games that I play that don't have mostly the same basic mechanics of a classic 52 card deck.  When we can agree to disagree then we can sit down and play some Tichu.  I think there is also a type of gamer that grew up on these sort of games played with a standard deck and as such there is a nostalgic draw they have that the rest of us never will.  Everyone has that to an extant and I'm sure my own gaming preferences reflect mine somewhat.  Maybe Tichu would benefit from a killer retheme and some crazy good artwork? Blasphemy!

03-23-2015 - Played once and I'm very impressed and eager to play more.  It's amazing how much you can get out of a single fairly small deck of cards.  There's randomness to it in the hand draws, as with all card games, but there's a good amount and strategery and it's not TOO often I suspect that you just get a "bad hand".  Side note unrelated to this game, it makes me realize how brilliant Diamonds really is.  It's not quite as deep, but you have so many ways to mitigate bad hands.  Anyway, back to Tichu, pretty stellar for a deck of cards.  8 for now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I have really enjoyed this game, but you need EXACTLY four players, of roughly equivalent skill (the same is true of Spades, Bridge, etc., of course, but it's easier to get virtually anyone to play Spades than it is to get people to play Tichu).  Also, the art is hideous.

My friend thermald and I keep talking about making a re-themed version. Someday, one of us will get around to it.

Tichu tries to look like a exotic card game, but it is very close to standard card deck game. Game itself is great partnership game - so if you have exatly 4 players, then this is a very good choice. I like it and I'd like to play it more...

RATING: N/A
Tichu is a partnership climbing card game, and the object of play is to rid yourself of your hand, preferably while scoring points in the process.

The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added: dog, phoenix, dragon and Mah Jong (1). When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination — single card, pair of cards, sequence of pairs, full house, etc. — or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, he wins the trick, clears the cards, and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards that can be played on that trick, so if a single card is led, then only single cards are played; if a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards can be played, etc.

Great pair played game that made the bridge obsolete and stiff. Simplier, quicker and more self-concentrated. The 5-10 players version is one of the best party games I have ever played.

Maybe not the most brain-burning, but the most 'colorful' game with a(n almost) standard deck of cards. The only game of this type that I rate higher than Bridge: while Bridge is undoubtedly a deeper and greater game, Tichu is simply more fun.

A ladder climbing game that looks & feel like a trick taking one.  Experience wise, this isn't much different from playing bridge or yuker with as much strategy but a bit more chaos thrown in (poker style "bombs").  It's fun but if I have real gamers around, I'd rather play a real board game, and if it's older folks / family, might as well play a similar game they already know (yuker, 500, etc.), leaving this with limited windows of play.

I understand Tichu has a good deal of depth and layers even if I don't get it all just yet (still learning the complexities).

Excellent partnership climbing game where taking tricks gets a few points but of primary purpose is really to play out of cards as quickly as possible.

3-6 players.  I completely understand why this is such a good game, so my rating is nothing more than a reflection of my own lack of skill at trick-taking games.  I don't mind playing them, and I was happy to be taught Tichu at Atlanta Game Fest 13, but I will never develop the love for it some folks have just because I have a much harder time with this category of card games.  I say all this, but my partner and I won the only game I've ever played, despite my protestations that no one would want me as a partner.  I even called tichu one round and actually made it!  Anyway, I'm glad to know the game, but doubt it will ever be one of my favorites.

My favorite card game of all time! So much fun. Love the partner aspect of the game. The German, French, and Italian decks are much more attractive than the English deck. (The boring English copy of Tichu does come with two decks though, which is an advantage, so one deck can be shuffled while the other deck is in play, keeping the game moving along nicely.) [I also own a special edition not in the database, developed for the "Gathering of Friends" convention.]

The artwork is amazing for the Uplay Italian version of Tichu. Only drawback is that they made the dragon and the phoenix look similar at first glance, in terms of color scheme, which confuses players who aren't familiar with this deck.

[I have 3 copies; 2 are brand new.]

I had heard so many good things about this game.  "Curt" rated it and Terra Mystica both as his only perfect 10s! I read the rules and decided it was just a deck of cards with four jokers, so I got my craftiness out and made four unique jokers for a deck of bicycle cards (picture to follow).  Looking forward to my first play and seeing why so many love this game so much.

RATING: 6
Ein Stichspiel, nicht unbedingt MEIN Stichspiel ;).
Das Spiel funktioniert zwingend nur mit 4 Spielern. Alle Karten werden ausgeteilt und die Spieler die sich gegenüber sitzen spielen im Team zusammen.
Bevor man die erste Karte spielt, darf man einen Tichu aussprechen, das heisst man wird als erster alle seine Handkarten los. Wenn man es schafft +100 Punkte fürs Team, andernfalls -100.
Ausgespielt werden dürfen Einzelkarten, (aufeinanderfolgende) Paare, Drillinge, Vierlinge (Stechen alles), Full House, Strassen (min 5 Karten).
Die ausgespielten Karten können nur mit gleichem Typ überboten werden (Paare auf Paare, höherwertiger Drilling kann ich auf kein Paar spielen).
Ziel ist es seine Karten los zu werden, am Ende einer Runde erhält man Punkte für Karten im Stich.
Habs verstanden, das Spiel ist auch ganz gut, aber mir tatsächlich zu hoch. Es ist ein Spiel für welche die es ständig spielen und auch mit einem Blick ihre Handkarten einschätzen können. Das kann ich nicht und habe auch kein Interesse es mir anzueignen...

Tichu has quite a cult following on this site and after one evening playing a few hands I would like to sign up as well.

I am not very familiar with the wide range of trick taking or partnership games but the multiple choices you have on each turn the role of the special cards and the scoring system have great appeal for me.

The rules seem initially confusing and slightly intimidating but play the first round open and immediately the subtleties, rhythms and originality of this game become apparent.  I now will carry a set everywhere and try and convert as many people as possible.  Join the cult (but dont drink the Kool-Aid)

Tichu is the new Bridge. There are very few team-based card games using a(n almost) regular deck of cards that can compete with Tichu. The problem with this game is that it takes quite some time to learn to play it properly and some people are outright confused as how to play it - more so than many much more complicated titles. This doesn't influence the score in any way though - it's still my favorite (regular deck based) card game.

Played only on BSW. Fun to play if you have a friend as your partner, that is, someone willing to forgive your mistakes, but not a game I like to play with random people on the 'Net.Took me several plays to get to this level of appreciation, though.  The scoring is pretty inelegant, so the strategy can take a while to grasp.  Also, what you can lead and can't lead is not entirely logical (running pairs is fine, but, for some reason, running triplets isn't).  I'm also not sure that the luck will necessarily even out over the course of a typical 1000 point game.  No worse than Lost Cities in that regard though.

UPDATE: Tichu often bores me now, and the importance of luck is growing increasingly obvious (although being able to assess your hand accurately [i]is[/i] important). I'm not sure that the passing mechanism quite works either. The emperor has no clothes. I'm dropping my rating to a 5, probably with nowhere to go but down.

I was told that most people either love this game and want to play it nonstop, or hate it. I on the other hand am somewhere in the middle: I enjoy this game but don't think I could play it over and over. I particularly would not want to play this with people who are too competitive, especially since there is card counting involved and you can really screw up your partner or set up your opponents if you don't play well. However, the added stuff to the popular Chinese card game Big Two were quite well received by me: the betting if you can go out first adds another dimension because your partner will have to try to set you up rather than going out themselves, and the special cards add a really interesting twist due to their nature of being really weak (the 1 and the dog can't beat anything, dragon and phoenix takes away points from you), but also very strong (1 can ruin your opponent's sets, dog can set up your teammate, dragon and phoenix can beat almost anything). The scoring does make the game drag, and making the score less would make the betting way too swingy, which is my only negative of this over Big Two.

This one is gonna take a lot more plays to truly start to grasp the depth of the strategy to be found. This is a very fine trick taking game. If you haven't had the opportunity you definitely should give it a try.

Update: A very good trick taker. One of my favorites.

After tons of plays later, this is not only the best trick taking game there is, but it makes you long to play it while you play others like it. It still needs 4 players, so there are other games I reach for with 3 or 5, but there are no other 3- player experiences that compare.

An interesting game, but one I can barely bring myself to play any more.  After 1000's of hands over the past few years, I have come to realize winning and losing is completely dependent on the cards you are dealt.  The skill plateau is pretty low in this one, and once everyone is there (and everyone after a couple hundred hands can get there) the only thing that matters is the cards you were dealt.

RATING: 7
Wonderful and addictive partnership game.  I had played Gang of Four before, as my first experience of chain games (in which each player in turn must play something higher in value than the previous play or pass), but came away from it with a bad taste.  However, Tichu has many of the same features but the differences make it a much more satisfying game - partnerships make it a team effort (and one bad hand is not necessarily the end of things for this hand), plus the card passing is not a required 'high card to the winner' mechanic but a selected card to each other player.  The subtleties of the strategy are slow to reveal themselves - I still feel like I could play better.

UPDATE: Having played a few more times, my enthusiasm for the game has waned a little (rating now 7).  At its best, this is a great game, but too many hands come by where one team has superior cards and there is little the disadvantaged team can do except for damage limitation.  When the hands are more evenly matched (with people ready to call Tichu) then this is a much more engrossing battle.

My favorite card game for 4p.  A wonderful partners climbing game.  Have spent hundreds of hours playing hands, but haven't recorded plays.  Brilliantly strategic, interactive, cut-throat, addictive.  Some luck is involved in the initial deal, but a skillful player will make the best use of every card and mitigate losses due to a poor hand.  Also play the non-partners climbing card games of "Haggis" [for 2-3p] or "Zheng Fen" [2-8p] for a similar experience.

Tichu, first published in 1991, still maintains a solid ranking in the top-100, attesting to its pervasive popularity through generations of gamers.  I hope to pass on a love for for this game to my children.

Partner, trick taking game that has a "climbing" mechanic.  You can play various poker hands from a single card to a full house.  Other plays must play the same type of hand and higher to take the trick.  There are four special cards with special powers otherwise it is a basic card deck.  

If you call "Tichu" before you take a trick and go out first, you get + 100 points.  If not, you lose 100.  

My family loves the game.  Very fun albeit a little complex at first if you are not familiar with climbing games.

This is an early rating based on one play. I like it quite a bit, but I don't quite get the strategy.

I'm not sure if everyone else liked it or not, but I see its potential.

Okay, now I think I know how to score, and the idea behind a "wish".  I'd still prefer pinochle, but this would be close in terms of my willingness to play a partner trick-taking game.

Although we were clobbered horribly in our first game (70 vs. 1030), I was willing to play again and things have gotten better since. Tichu is a bit too dependent on the luck of the draw to truly win my heart, but it's quite enjoyable nevertheless. Played 20  times.

I've owned a copy of this for years. I made one aborted attempt at learning/teaching the game with my family right after I bought it. It then sat on my game shelf gathering dust until I recently purchased the iPad App. After feverously playing the app version for days, I introduced it to my game group. I gotta say, playing with real humans is whole lot more fun. I love this game. 

One caveat: it is a tough game to wrap your head around at first. Not because it is a hard game, but there a number of moving parts in the structure and scoring aspects of the game. I would suggest player aids for newbie players and playing a dummy hand to help explain.

RATING: 4
Probably my favorite of the climbing trick taking games right now.  It does have a bit of a learning curve, but the game play is fairly entertaining.  

After all of the players reach the same level of experience and skill, however, things tilt strongly in favor of the player/team that happens to get the best cards in a hand, which can be frustrating for me, when I know that it didn't matter what I decided to play, I would lose anyway.

10+ (really 100+) plays with 3, 4, and 6 players.

I love card games, but I HATE this game.  The special cards are pictorially meaningless and therefore impossible to keep straight, I never have any idea what they do.  The scoring is nonsensical.  I look at my hand and have no idea whether it's good or bad or what to do with it.  Pure frustration.

There's so much Tichu proselytizing around, I'm surprised it took me so long to play it. But my attitude had always been that I didn't really need to know another trick-taking card game. And my verdict after playing? Essentially the same. Just learn bridge. I can see why people like Tichu, but bridge is all-around a better and deeper game.

I like almost all trick-taking games, but this one is especially good and powerfully addictive.  I really like the ability to pass once, but come in on a trick later.

7 JUNIO 2005: Comprado en Gamefest y esperando su primer juego.
Aun no jugado, 8,14 dado por mis Geekbuddies
4 de julio de 2005: jugado un par de veces. Excelente, aunque tengo algunas dudas.
SÍNTESIS DEL JUEGO: se juega en parejas y es para 4 personas (hay versiones hasta para 10 personas, aunque la versión de 4 es la mejor).
El primer jugador juega una combinación (carta simple, par, trío, escala, doble par consecutivo, etc) y el de la izquierda la sigue. Quien tiene la msma combinacón pero en cartas superiores se lleva la mano.
La idea es terminar las cartas de la mano (14 c/ jugador). El último pierde sus cartas y las manos ganadas y se las pasa al adversario.
Hay cartas especiales que permiten ganar las manos, a un cierto costo.
El quid del juego es: terminar rápido la mano, mas que ganar puntos y tener el control de la mano siguiente, para lograr el objetivo anterior.
Muy táctico. Por muchos considerado el mejor juego de cartas existente. Y por lo jugado, puede ser.

I like ladder climbing games, but this game is too tense for my liking, and is basically a 4 player only game. People get too tense while playing this, as one mistake can cost you the game. And i find the addition of the specialty cards, the dragon, dog, bombs, etc, make this game unnecessarily complicated. I much prefer The Great Dalmuti.

Classic. I'm not a huge trick-taking fun but I like the partnership aspect of Tichu a lot. I'm actually pretty bad at it and lose most of the games, but still like it a lot. It's really not a good idea to be on my team if you want to win.. I'd probably rate it 10 if I was better at it.

2-Player Comment:

Simply a superior "climbing" card game. 
Takes a little while to get all the rules down, but, wow.... truly exciting and fun. 
Without a doubt, my favorite card game. 
I'm hooked!
Update: Well now everyone (9 people) in my family plays Tichu and at least 2 to 3 times a week, there is a game going on at one of our houses. 
Simply printed out one of the player aids from here at BGG so that everyone that plays has a ready reference at their finger tips. 
Introduced it to 4 friends from church and now they all play. 
My wife taught 2 women from the consignment store and now they are regular players. 
At this rate, most of Indiana will be playing Tichu while Euchre becomes the card game of choice from the past.
Fantastic game that has earned my only 10! 
If you like partnership card games and you don't play Tichu, you are just missing out.

I love card games, and this one is better than most.  It allows for a lot of personal style in gameplay. Hands can be quite malleable which allows for *quite* a bit of post-game discussion.

RATING: N/A
I've now had my first play of this highly-rated game. I managed to get two cards out of my first hand before everyone else had cleared theirs. My partner was leader from the start and I only had a legal play after the first player from the other team had emptied their hand, by which point I was really annoyed that I still had a full hand of cards.

I'll give it another go as I'm sure I was just unlucky, but for a first game it gave me no reason to want to play again, but looks destined to be one of those card games for which I know the rules, but don't properly understand.

Euchre has officially been fired.  The special cards have more appeal than the bowers of Euchre.  Difficult to convert the average card player into giving it a try.

*Raised rating to 9.5 after a heated game with some seasoned Euchre players on New Years Eve 2010.  All of them adapted to the game by the second hand.  They even revealed some aspects of its strategy that never occurred to me.

One of the best card games avaible. An evening playing cards, with Tichu, Spades and 500 can't be less than a great evening. Everybody who's a fan of trick taking, strategy card games has to give it a try. 4 player is the best, but the 3 players variant is not too bad. More than 6 is a bit too much. But there's rule to play of up to 10!!

A very interesting trick-taking card game. I like to say that the suits in this card game are different poker combinations (a high card, a pair, two pairs,..) and you have to match them just as you would have to match suits in other trick-taking card games. First few games are very confusing and it take quite some games to get the strategy down. It is played in two pairs and is very competitive. I like competitive games :).

RATING: 7
Obviously this is a very good card game based on the reviews on the Geek, but I don't really get excited about team-based card games, and this is no exception.  Personally, I'd rather play Gang of Four for the "screw the other players" aspect of scoring and more enjoyable solo strategies.  However, Tichu does have a lot of very interesting scoring and gameplay mechanics (Dragon is 25 points but gets passed to the other team, Dog passes play to your teammate, Phoenix is a wild card but is worth -25 points, first person out gets last person's points, etc.), which definitely makes it stand out above similar trick-taking games.  With the right group, this game can be fiercely competitive and tons of fun, but with the wrong group, it can be tedious and downright boring.

I like Tichu. I initially hated the pass, but that is one of the more skill intensive parts of the game. Learning the nuances of passing is a cornerstone to proficiency. It is just something that isn't taught enough. How can you learn when you're playing, making the same mistake the umpteenth time?

This game has some good complex strategy.  While I can see how good play can break a lot of good hands, I still feel that an it is too easy to get an unstoppable hand.  I&#039;ll need to play a few more times.

After playing I am very mystified how this one gets so many consistent ultra-high marks.  Oh, sure, it is a fine enough game, but there are literally dozens of card games that are very similar.  I find Mu and even Rook as compelling, or more so, than this one, yet this has almost a fanatic following.  Has it been well distributed?  Have people not been exposed to other such card games?  Am I missing the boat on something mega-amazing?

I only play this when 3 other people look at me with tears in their eyes and whimper "P-P-P-Please?  Please play Tichu?" and then they agree to play whatever I want afterwards.  Otherwise no, I do not want to play Tichu.  The reality is, if I could go the rest of my life without ever playing Tichu again, it would be swell.

This is among only a handful of games that I would give a 9+ rating (the others would be Puerto Rico, RA, and Jambo), this is, to me the ultimate card game.  It has everything...enough skill to make each player feel like they can influence the outcome, enough luck to make each hand unpredictable, the chance of something completely unexpected happening (ie. 1-A, or 2 bombs in the same hand...).  The partnership aspect makes the game, however, by adding a whole new level of strategy.  You can easily kick ass with your own cards and end up with fewer points.  The subtle balance between helping yourself and helping your partner gives this game a re-playability factor much higher than the average card game.  This one is a must have.

A game with very tense moments (even more than Texas Hold'em Poker).
Tichu is fun because of:
- the tichu betting
- teamplay
- some analysis needed (as in poker)
- its simplicity of rules
- the tense finish of every game

One of the best games around, which is a lot to say for such a simple game.

After a couple of plays, Tichu is as good as advertised. I love team vs team games, and there aren't many. This feels to me like a mix of Euchre and The Great Dalmuti that somehow manages to be greater than the sum of its parts.

Like Euchre, I love trying to get on the same page with a teammate I can't communicate with. It's wonderful when it happens, and developing a rapport by playing with the same partner for a prolonged time is very rewarding.

I find that I'm teaching this a lot. I need to start playing with people who have played before.

I own the iPad application version of [i]Tichu[/i], which is beautifully done and quick and enjoyable to play--no shuffling, no dealing! The AI opponents are plenty tough for a beginner like me, even on their basic settings. Having this app is also a good thing because I've never been able to gather a foursome of real opponents, so at least I'm getting to experience the game in some form. As it is, I like [i]Tichu[/i] well enough, but don't anticipate joining the ranks of its adoring fans (no dragon tattoos for me, sorry).
 
P.S. About ten years ago, I remember some of my students were addicted to similar game called [i]Pusoi[/i]. If I had the chance now I would try to convince them that [i]Tichu[/i] is clearly the superior game.

My family and friends have played a "version" of Tichu under the name  Chinese Poker or Shou Ba Yi, which is more of a trick taking game than a true poker hand game (although, my Chinese inlaws insist on calling it Poker).

The best trick-taking game I have ever played. It is amazing how much adding couple of extra cards to a playing card deck does to the game. Tichu also borrows some fun traits from poker games - for example, some calling Grand Tichu makes the round feel completely different.

Tichu also has a lot of strategy going on. You have to keep track of many things and thinking ahead how to play your cards is not an easy task. And when you add your team mate to this, Tichu has a lot to learn for years to come. 

The biggest downside of Tichu is its 4-player requirement. I've not played the 3-player variant but I would assume it is not even not close as fun as the basic 4-player game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
The 1 rating is for the false provenance and actively harmful rule that you can play bombs whenever you like.

I think the essence of the game merits a higher rating, however. See my rating for Zheng Fen on that regard.

I play Zheng Fen [see pagat.com] with the addition of [ONLY] the partnerships, passing, special cards, straight-flush bomb, and bidding aspects of Tichu. No slapjack bombs.

UPDATE: The more I read the Rules forum threads concerning the bomb rules, the more I dislike the Tichu I never learned. Honestly, they break everything that is the game.

Tichu is in my top 5 card games of all time. It plays similar to Gang of Four (or should that be the other way around...) but Tichu offers much more depth and many more interesting combinations.

Tichu also allows for partner play and this is where it shines for me. Perhaps its greatest feature is the potential for comebacks, even from seemingly impossible positions. 

The only downside is the poorly written rules but the Geek can help here. Once you are past that speed bump you are in for a treat.

It's easy to see why this is THE trick-taking/ladder-climbing game that gets praised above all the others. The mechanisms of the game are simple, but there's just enough thrown in to make the strategy of the game deep and rewarding to those who play this a lot. I haven't dabbled into the variants that much, but the base game on its own has a great deal to explore. I feel like this is the perfect weight game for my tastes, as it doesn't feel as convoluted as Haggis, nor is it as light as The Great Dalmuti. In many ways, it feels a lot like Frank's Zoo, but adds in just enough extra things to make it feel like more of a gamer's game. Tichu is definitely a classic, and one that I feel deserves more recognition among modern gamers.

Big 2 has long been one of my favorite card games, in various incarnations. Tichu compares favorably to the other climbing trick games for having partnership play and greater strategic depth.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Partnership game where one tries to get rid of cards in their hands, leading out poker type hands (singletons, pairs, any length straight, full house, four of a kind, etc. but no flushes). Twist is that it is not the first player out, points are awarded on the tricks taken and whoever is last out must give their tricks to the first one out. Players also pass cards at the beginning as well. Deck is formed by adding 4 special cards to a normal 52 card deck. Before playing a card, players may declare that they will get rid of their cards first (called a "Tichu") to earn more points or lose points if they fail.  Fun game that gets tense when someone calls a Tichu.

I have no idea why this Climbing game is so popular in USA. It is the variant of Presidential/Asshole or more precisely, Zheng Feng. It feels very old as I played these games when I was 10. What is the big deal about this game?

The game has many small rules and high-luck factor with long playing time. It is ok to play for 2-3 deals but not for 1000 points!

There are much better climbing-like games around, namely, Poison, Too Many Cooks, Attacke and Escalation. 

As for better partner-ship games, we got Goita, Einfach Genial, Lost Cities, and Robot Master.

Play them instead of Tichu!

I love good trick-taking games and Tichu is one of the better ones I've played. It seems very confusing at first, but after a few hands, the strategies present themselves as you grasp the way to play the special cards and how to best take advantage of the lead. ***UPDATE 4-17-07*** My rating is now a 9. I grow to love Tichu more with every play. It is one of the few card games where a bad hand is not necessarily the kiss of death.

It's unlikely for me to decline the offer to play Tichu - it's a great, and highly addicting game.

Raised from 8 to 8.5 on March 22nd, 2007, after a wonderful game, with such highlights as me playing the A bomb on the dragon - saying Tichu - when my opponent, who also said Tichu, had one card left! I also made the call.

November 20th, 2007: Rating raised from 8.5 to 10. Why? Well, it fully fullfills the criteria. I think this game is outstanding, I always want to play it, and I expect this will never change. This is sheer perfection in a box.

I enjoy Tichu, but I've found it to be a dud among my other gaming friends.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Despite its recent development, Tichu is not a modern-style game at all. Tichu is a partnership, trick-taking game, and the fact that not even the cards differ much from regular playing cards may turn off board gamers. Team up with your girlfriend against your parents, who may feel at home with playing cards but like the variation enough to appreciate a new game.

If you are brand new to Tichu, good luck with the rules. Expect your first few rounds to be absolute chaos.

The combination of Tichu requiring exactly 4 players (preferably with equal skill), being not much to look at, and a bitch to explain to newcomers, forced it out of my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Very fun trick-taking card game.  Reminds me much of a game I used to play in college called 'Trapped'.  

Partners sit across the table from each-other and try to take the lead away from their opponents by playing better hands than them.  Over the course of several rounds a winner is determined by scoring 1000 points.

The partner/team aspect in this game is it's most redeeming quality.  There is something glorious about good teamwork that leads to you and your partner going out first and second.  Luck plays a role sometimes in this game, however with good play it usually can be alleviated.

Partnership climbing game for a standard-ish deck of cards. Like Bridge, the partnership aspect really makes an otherwise standard game take off.

Very similar to another Spanish trick taking card game (played with the Spanish deck), whose name I don't remember, but with the Poker deck + extra cards.

It's only a 4 players game. Its lenght can be tailored to your available time.

You have plenty of decisions to take and the gameflow is very dynamic. Overall, it's a great light game and you will especially enjoy it if you have a stable partner.

Tichu is basically standard deck of 52 cards + 4 special cards. If you're not a fan of traditional games this might not be too big hit for you.

For everyone else, it's a climbing card game with plenty options how to play your cards. Experience definitely pays of. Tichu is always a thrill to play. One game to 1000 points has enough drama but isn't too long. Just a great game for exactly 4 players.

Fondamentalmente non è un gioco ma un semplice mazzo di carte con l'aggiunta di quattro carte speciali. Bello giocarlo a coppie, senza troppi ragionamenti e azzardando un po' di piccoli Tichu o di grandi Tichu. Un giochino senza pretese dove non mancherà un po' di strategia e la necessità di fare esperienza. Il caso nella distribuzione delle carte influenzerà molto la partita, anche se alcune regole simpaiche (lo scambio iniziale di carte e la perdita delle proprie prese da parte dell'ultimo) rendono il gioco imprevedibile anche se non manca una strategia di fondo che gli eseprti del gioco seguono scrupolosamente a cominciare dal draft iniziale. Divertente il lancio, in qualunque momento del gioco, delle bombe!

Not exactly the bridge-substitute hyped by various proponents around here. A decent competitive rummy with the pairs version being the only variant worth playing. But it's really only a cheap shadow of two much more authentic games, with a novelty deck of cards which only just toes the line of not being a normal deck of cards.

Tai Pan, ik had het spel reeds lang gekocht, maar nog steeds niet gespeeld.  Een (verlengd) weekend ardennen was de ideale gelegenheid om dit kaartspelletje eens uit te proberen.  Spijtig dat het al bijna 1 jaar in mijn kast lag, want Tai Pan mag er best zijn.  
Helaas neemt 999 Games een loopje met de spelomschrijving.  Volgens de tekst op het doosje kan je dit spel spelen tot 12 personen maar op de speluitleg staat dat je vanaf 7 spelers 2 spelletjes moet kopen.
Eigenlijk vind ik het best met 4 spelers, nl 2 teams van 2.  Ik heb het ook met 6 gespeeld, maar vind de strategie en taktiek met 4 beter.

This is, without question, the greatest card game ever invented.  Apart from Poker, this is the game I could play for an entire evening and not feel bored for a second.

Unlike so many other games, where the cards you're dealt severely limits what you can do, Tichu's partnership aspects and special cards give you a much broader palette to work with.

This might be the only game I own three copies of where I'm worried that might not be enough - I know they'll wear out eventually.

Great initial impression despite high expectations going in.  Has a fun factor I do not quite get from hearts and other standard card games.  Maybe this can get the play time from my gaming core I hoped to get out of race.

Power cards are all balanced, and the luck seemed fairly even throughout the first game.  This is my type of game for teamwork.  This has potential to break 8 or 9 on the rating.

Edit: Broke the threshold past 8, this game is just so good.  It has 10 potential, I'll see how I still feel about it in a few months.  The strategy options are endless.

Edit: Had to move to a 10.  I play the game about 8 times a week.  Too much strategy, too many good decisions, too much fun to be anything less than a 10.

RATING: 10
50+ plays. It’s one of the all-time classic 4 player partnership climbing trick games. The decisions come thick and fast on what cards to pass on, when to play or hold back, when to Tichu (bet that you’ll be first to rid your hand of cards for bonus points) and when not, when to be selfish and when to help your partner. Someone’s always going to go out first, and if they didn’t call Tichu (it must be called before their first card is played, but that could be well into the trick while others are playing theirs out while waiting for the opportunity to pounce), that’s 100 points effectively lost, so there’s always an interesting analysis to perform on your chances. The other aspect that elevates the game is the ever-present fear that a bomb (normally 4 of a kind) is lurking in an opponent’s hand that will ruin your otherwise unbeatable plan to be the next person out. And the fun of holding a bomb! There’s lots to enjoy with each hand.

If I could only ever play one partnership game for the rest of my life then this would be it. Plays of Tichu tap into my childhood memories of 500 and Euchre but add so much more. The thrill of dropping your whole hand in a single straight, the agony of whether to break up that killer full house, the triumph of a last second overbomb, the added wrinkle of how to use the special cards. 4 player card games don't get any better.

One of the best card games out there. Playing in teams is especially good, you must play as a team but also ensure that you do not finish last and try to block others or help your teammate if they call Tichu (claim that they will finish first). A must for those who like trick taking games.

Partnership trick taking at its finest.  Well, Bridge is perhaps the deeper game.  But I enjoy Tichu more.  Never was a big fan of the dummy hand in Bridge.  But as good as Tichu is, I do find a couple of drawbacks.  One is the scoring.  Because of the negative value cards and getting set on Tichu calls, games can run too long.  In Haggis, for example, all scoring is progressive; if you are set on a bet the points simply go to the opponent.  I also like the bomb system in Haggis far better.  And as interesting as the special cards are, I still find them a bit wonky.  Great game still, though.

The partnership trick-taking game seems to have its roots in the traditional card game Big Deuces.  There is a good deal of strategy and interaction between both your partner and your opponents, but I think most of all, the game provides a good medium to socialize with people.  Trick-taking games aren't really my thing, but Tichu does have its niche.

I love Big 2.  I like Gang of Four.  But Tichu was just...annoying.  Based on all the great comments, I'm sure there's a good game in there.  But compared to the other two games, it just seems way too obfuscated and overcomplicated.  I'll reserve the right to change my rating based on any subsequent plays, however. 

Update 11/7/09:  Okay, I understand better how the game works now, and I do enjoy it.  Looking forward to playing more Tichu.

Playtime: ~30-90 minutes. Averages about 60 minutes.

Comment: This is the best trick taking/ladder climbing game I've played. I have a few complaints about it however. One, the game can go quite long depending on if you call Tichu/Grand Tichu wrong and both sides do that. It can also be over before it even starts. I've had games fly by because of a Grand Tichu call and a few one-two going out. Two, is that it's not the easiest to teach players. It's not hard to pick up if you've played other trick taking games, but man does this get confusing to a new player.

My only other minor complaint about the game is that it requires 4 players. 4 players is a tough spot to occupy because there are a LOT of good games that play perfectly with 4. This game requires it and as such, must fight everything else in that zone. Still, I love this game even though it's riddled with a few minor problems.

Side note: I wonder if we change the Tichu call to 'lose 50 points and give 50 to your opponent, or win and gain 100'. Either way, it's a 100 point swing, but not as brutal as losing a full round of scoring.

RATING: 5.5
Very addictive game, people usually catch up quickly when I explain the rules and it's a fast game, so you can play even 2-3 rounds within 5 minutes. I enjoy very much playing it, though I might turn it down for a euro game, as I slightly dislike the randomness of the cards -- if the other team has most of the high cards, you can't do much.

Un muy buen juego de cartas para 4 jugadores el cual se juega en pareja, quizás ésta sea la única pega que pueda tener el juego. Esta mezcla de póker y el clásico culo hará que te vicies a una partida que puede llegar a la hora. Su duración es lo único que le puede fallar aunque algunas partidas no se alargan tanto.

Tichu is played at work almost every lunch break. Even after more than 500 plays, the game still holds my interests. As a card game, luck plays an important role, but there's enough skill involved that most of the times when you win it feels like an accomplishment.

Card play is not straightforward, but it seems a large part of the skill needed to play tichu is in passing the cards, and in calling tichu. Grand tichu calls are worth many points; I specialize in them.

I also play on BSW.

One of the best card shedding games out there with decent strategy, which isn't always obvious to pick up on vs other games.  It plays quickly and over a series of hands to the end, can mitigate lucky (and unluckly) streaks.

The game has four special power cards, while adds to the strategy, also add fiddly rules to the game.

1/24/10: I have played a variation of this game with my cousins when I was a kid.  I think it was called K-10-5, or at least that's what my older cousin called it when he taught it to us.  Regardless of the name, it's an insanely fun game.  Recommended if you like trick-taking card games, which I do.  It plays fast too.  You can have long sessions of Tichu (by playing up to a high score), or you can just play a hand or three and be done in 20 minutes.  Great game.

RATING: 10
The iPad app turned me into a Tichu addict. 

It's a climbing game, played with a standard (well, almost standard) deck of cards. The whole game revolves around the tradeoff between keeping the initiative and getting rid of cards, which is fairly intricate and difficult (in a good way) thing to manage. You can also bet on your performance, when you think you'll do weel, for a significant payoff. 

The partnership aspect adds yet another layer and the result is very fun and addictive.

Fun partnership traditional card game. Doesn't have quite the fun of Bridge for me, but has the benefit of being much more accessible and still deeper than most card games. There's a distinct several-game learning curve, most importantly recognizing the potential point swing at the end of the game when player #4 hands over their tricks to #1, learning how to handle the Phoenix and the Dragon, and figuring out the importance of maintaining control of the bid. I'd be very interested in learning how advanced Tichu players signal information to their partners.

This was our favourite card game for a while, but like PR it has lost some of it's appeal. This should hit the table more often. 
We played a few weeks ago after not playing for a long time... My team had a lot of bad luck, but we still had fun.

It's back! We play it pretty often as the last game of the evening, or if we don't know how much time we have left - you can stop after any hand if you want to, though we usually manage a game 'til 1000.

My all-time favorite card game.  Each new hand is a new series of possibilities, and being dealt an identical hand 2 or 3 times (unless it's packed with bombs) will often lead to 2 or 3 different ways to play it.  Tough, meaningful decisions begin in the pushing phase and continue through each hand.  I love how dynamic and exciting this game is; there's nothing else quite like it out there.

Enjoyable member of the climbing family, with extra features adding a learning curve, elevating its status among the others (Great Dalmuti, Frank's Zoo), but at the same time making it difficult to access until experienced. Because of negative scoring possibilities, this may make Tichu overstay it's welcome as well as evaluating the card combinations can lead to slow game pacing. Still, an enjoyable first session.

A hybrid trick-taking & climbing card game.  While not as challenging and interesting as "Bridge" and lacking the elegant simplicity of "Oh Hell" or "Hearts", it is fun and gripping enough to give it infinite replayability value. Of course, Bridge is the ultimate 4-player trick-taking game and in a league of its own with a long learning curve.
Based on dozens of plays (first time on 03/16/05).
Update 04/18/06:  raised from 6.5 to 7.

There are many variations of the public domain game Big Two - this is one of them. Unfortunately the weird complexities of the special cards robs the game of the little strategies available. Gang of Four, Great Delmutti, Franks Zoo, etc are better games.  The absolute worst idea in this game is the Grand Tichu. Basically Grand Tichu has a player bet 20% of all of the points in the game on his next hand before seeing his cards!! What the hell was the designer smoking when he thought this one up?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
[floatleft][ImageID=354872][/floatleft][b][u]Initial Impressions:[/u][/b]
Tichu is an incredible card game. I cannot think of a better partnership game for two versus two players besides maybe Crokinole. When I have a group of four players at game night, the first question I always ask myself is, "Do we play Tichu or something else?" There in lies the rub... Tichu's Achilles's heal is that it is only playable with 4. The other player count variants are not even worth my time.

[floatright][ImageID=711341][/floatright][b][u]What I like:[/u][/b]
Tichu is a game that invokes a wide range of emotions. The emotion of joy is evoked by successfully completing a Grand Tichu call to make a gaming winning come back. Dread is felt when you miss that Tichu call by one card. A level of deviousness is felt when you complete a bomb from cards from the opponent's push cards or when you give the Dog to the opponent who just called Grand Tichu. There are so many things to love about Tichu that comes with the ups and downs from each hand.

Tichu becomes the most rewarding at a high level of play. At that point, the game begins to develop a flow. Partners can begin to synergize with one another with a higher level of game understanding. Partners must work together to achieve a win but at the same time you must balance playing for yourself to strengthen your position.

[b][u]What I dislike:[/u][/b]
I find teaching Tichu to be cumbersome without player aids, especially with non-gamers. Ideally I always try to teach only one new person in a game and I always try to have player aids packed away for emergency Tichu teaching. After people hurdle the hump of learning, they seem to have a hard time wanting to play anything else.

[b][u]Overall:[/u][/b]
I think everyone should have a copy of Tichu in their collection. This truly is THE best 4 player game.

Although Tichu can take a wide range of number of players, I've only played Tichu Nanking for 4 players.

The rules read a lot harder than they are and it's best to learn this game from someone who already knows the rules. Plays in about 45 mins and given that the cards played to the trick are similar to other card games, this is a good gateway game to introduce people to card games not played using a standard card deck. 

I'm still a long way off from figuring out the strategies though.

Because I was obliged to play Asshole during my lunch break while in high school despite my repeated attempts to introduce my friends to other card games, I can never rate *any* climbing game like Tichu highly.

Tichu does add interesting strategic choices in the game, like the four special cards, bombs, and scoring (as opposed to the upsetting and irritating richer-get-richer mechanism of Asshole). However, it's still a climbing game, and all those games categorically get a maximum rating of 2.

I was taught Big Two in college and haven't played in years, so I was excited to find Tichu.  It's every bit as good as I remember, but unfortunately this suffers the same fate as Mu in my group-- not enough "serious" card players to get it to the table very often.

I do like the game, but you need people that are just as engaged and get the somewhat bogged rules. If they cut a bit more off the rules such as the Tichu and Grand Tichu bets and streamlined the point system further, I think people would catch on easier. And the card passing system just slows the game more down than it should. Finally, this game is probably easy to replicate with just a standard deck of cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I had really high expectations for Tichu, so I probably have a more negative reaction to it than I would have if I knew nothing about it going into the first game.

Here's what I do like:
:star: I enjoy the hand management aspect and the kinds of decisions that are involved in managing a hand in this way.  Do you try to win a trick now or wait until later when it might be more useful?  Do you break up a three of a kind in order to get in on the tricks?  Those kinds of questions are fun and painful to answer and make for some great gaming experiences.
:star: I enjoy trying to figure out which cards I will get passed and which cards I should get rid of.  It's complicated and kind of wonderful.
:star: I love that it's a partner game.  I love partnership card games.

Here's what I don't like:
:star: Depending on how you play your hand, you can be left  doing nothing for a really long time.  It's boring to pass for much of the game. And if you do well, your reward is to sit around while everyone else plays.  That's less fun than a standard trick taking game where everyone runs out of cards at the same time.
:star: This is a personal reason.  I have a much more difficult time wrapping my mind around Tichu than I do a  trick taking game.  
:star: I don't like that the person who gets the Mah-Jong card can make a wish that will rip the heart out of a huge run you've gotten lucky enough to be dealt and render your hand worthless.  I realize that there is risk management involved in this and that as a new player, I have not figured out strategies to combat this, but as a new player, it makes the game less fun and I don't like that.

Overall, I plan to play more Tichu in hopes that I can some day figure it out.  But I would greatly prefer to play a standard trick taking game especially one that has partners.

I've always been a huge fan of Euchre and tend to enjoy any partner trick taking games.  Tichu seems like the ultimate combination of strategic depth, good partnering, elements of luck, and best of all, gambling!

It's hard to beat the excitement of a Large Tichu that comes down to the last trick!  My first games were the most enjoyeable as I was figuring out how to appropriately play various situations.  The more I play, the more "obvious" the correct choice of what to play becomes, but it's still got a great feel to it.

This game also tends to be received well by other people that are into card games, but maybe haven't tried out any interesting board games.  Of all the people I've shown this to, it only fell cold with one of them.

Euchre killer and that's saying something from a Hoosier. All of my Euchre friends agree and each of them I've introduced this to have either started playing online or bought their own deck. One guy even said he started having dreams of playing the game!!

RATING: 7
Currently played once and enjoyed it.  It reminded me of a cross between Spades and The Great Dalmuti.  Obviously its more than just that (and it certainly predates them I would guess) but that was the "flavor" I got from playing it.

By the end of our first game I had just started to grasp how the Phoenix and Dragon are useful.  At first I was puzzled by them as they can help your opponents.  What started to dawn on me as you can use them to help yourself *more* than you help your opponents if you can play them at the right time.  The "wish" ability of the Mahjong seems odd - still trying to wrap my head around how that should be used.

I had fun playing it and would certainly like to play again.  It didn't blow me away or anything, however, so for now I will give it a 7.

I was a nay sayer for a long while, but this is an excellent game.  A few tweaks lift it realms above other "climbing games" such as Great Dalmuti, Who's the Ass, Frank's Zoo.  Many ways to play each hand, with real choice and drama. It feels a little "lighter" in play than a hardcore trick-taking game.

As in most trick takers, experienced players will have an advantage.  That said, even when I'm out gunned, I still enjoy myself.  Fun game.  I do have to say that I'm just a recreational Tichu player.  Memorizing bidding conventions - past odds left, evens right - is not an investment that I plan to make in the game.

RATING: 7.94
Having now bought a copy and managed to persuade some people to play I can see what the fuss is about. This is essentially a Chinese version of bridge. Tricks are made in groups (a pair must follow a pair, a full house a full house, and so on) but while taking tricks is important players are also trying to empty their hands. The last player in gives away points to the opponents.
The game is played with a standard deck of playing cards plus four special cards - its about as traditional a card game as you can get.
But where-as Bridge is made interesting (or dull again if you get advanced enough) by layering an extra bidding mechanism on top Tichu is a dynamic and interesting trick-taking/getting out card game. 
The down-side is that this is a partnership game (two teams of two), and like any partnership game therefore just a bit harder to get to the table than games with a variable number of players.

Tichu is a fun card game for four players.  If you like spending the evening playing card games like hearts, rummy, gin, canasta, etc. This game is on par with any of those.  There are some great risk taking moments to be had as well as big showdown plays which are always fun and cause exclamations of delight/dismay depending on which end of the whammy you are on.  Highly recommend it to those who like classic card gaming.

Whoah... chaos, energy, developing a strategy for your hand, having it screwed, rearranging, changing your plans when your opponents threaten a Grand Tichu - glorious. I was originally going to give it a lower score - because there is limited think-ahead planning, given a certain chaos factor - but I really can't, given the sheer level of enjoyment I get from this game. i could play it for days straight and be completely ecstatic, until I drowned in my own Tichu-generated sweat.

Growing up in Indiana, I have always been exposed to card games like Euchre, Spades, and Hearts, and I was really getting sick of sitting down to play cards, but now I've played Tichu!

Tichu is a game you just have to play one more time, no matter how many games you've played. Every time I think I have the game down pat, something comes out of the blue and I find myself reevaluating my approach to the game.

This game is, to put it simply, amazing. Even when victory seems imminent, the losing team can come from behind if they play their cards right. This game makes every card important, so any hand can be used to make a serious influence in the sequence of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I underestimated this game, when I first played it. Oh just a new card game, it cannot be so difficult. I didn't get it quite. After a few plays it worked and was very much fun to play. I think the game weight is rated too low here (today 2.4).Or it's just not a kind of game I'm used to play. Many decisions involved, rules are quite short. I like that.

Plenty of complexity trying to figure how best to play a hand - which can change as cards are played.  Trying to pin my likes to a single point - I have come to the fact that I really enjoy the ability to pass playing at a point in time only to be able to jump back in later.  As a result, no plays are forced and every play is now an active decision to play cards.

Game needs exactly four players who all should be of approximately equal skill....taking my rating down a notch.

05-06-2014. Rated after 1 play. Tichu is a partner trick-tacking / ladder climbing game. I am no big fan of partner games, but I do like this game regardless. I think I'll have to recognize that much more plays will lead to mastery of the game which I think is what the game needs to shine. Probably the reason why I'll never get the full 100% out of it. Also makes it difficult to introduce new players to the game I think, as experienced players will find no challenge here.

RATING: 6
I don't understand why this game is so popular - it's ok, but it's not really worth spending money on a game that is basically just a traditional card game.  And it really has nothing on its progenitor, Big Two, which is a lighter but much more fun game.  While I understand Tichu is a ladder game, not trick-taking, if you want partnerships, play Bridge.  If you want scoring, play Hearts, where the scoring is intrinsic to the game, as opposed to the pasted-on scoring in Tichu (why do only 5/10/K score - because it's easier to count, although some traditional card games and Dominoes use this scoring as well). And if you want a ladder game, play Big Two.  No scoring, but you're always striving to be King of the Hill each game, works at several player counts, and players can drop in and out.

I have played a ton of this game. I really think its the best trick taking game at this point. Its not as deep as bridge, but its just plain fun.

I knew that Tichu was well-regarded by many gamers, but I had no idea how addictive and fun it is. It's a very thoughtful game, but it's also dramatic.

Something for everyone, as it were.

My go to card game for 4, so fun! s'like someone just took all of the fun things and threw them into a game--card passing! bidding! super high stakes extra bidding! climbing! 2v2! etc. 

can be overwhelming for some card players, as it does feel weird to traditionalists (not so much to boardgamers, who are used to all kinds of rules) which is why I'm happy to have Rook (more serious) and Wizard (less serious) on the standby for more traditional folk.

Wouldn't mind getting into Bridge as a 4p card game, but no one I know is into it. Bridge (like Mahjong) is one that am curious about & may get into someday, dependent on opponents. But I'm not excited enough about them to devote time to study them regardless of available players (unlike something like Space Empires 4X, which is so exciting I want to own it even if I never play it with others!).

Great teamplay cardgame. Lots of tactical decisions and more interesting than classic teamplay cardgames for me, because of bombs and special cards give the game some more twists and crazy elements. The good players will win often, because you have to look what the others have and manage your hand best. As always in card games, there is some luck involved. If you AND your teampartner have both a bad hand, then you will most likely lose. But hey, you play again. It's cheap, colorful and a marvellous game, also for carrying to the pub.

It seems to me that this card game is more dependent upon the luck of the cards than I usually like. Quite often the decisions seem to made for you. I like the game play, but the 200 points straight out for coming first and second is a hefty bonus that seems just too generous to me. Calling Tichu is a gutsy gambling mechanism to set apart the men from the boys. There are some nice quirks to the game and it's fun to play, but it's no Skat or Mü. The luck of the cards isn't really offset by a decent points scoring mechanism - instead it's mostly all or nothing. I prefer to play other card games to this one, but I don't mind it.

I love team games, and this one seems to have several layers of complexity: first you try to empty your hand first, then you try to take the value of the cards into account, then you try to say Tichu and Great Tichu at the right times to improve your scores... And the replayability seems endless.

There is a bunch of flapdoodle in the manual about this game being inscrutable, but try  to hold your eye-rolls and ignore that because once I got over the initial learning hurdle I found a card game of the traditional suit/rank style that I'm always up to play. Four players only. There's 3 player rules in the manual. Ignore those as well.

RATING: 10
Tichu is a climbing card game (in the same family as "President" or "Asshole") descended from Zheng Fen with a few less combinations and different "bombs" but with partnerships, card passing, four special cards, and extra scoring. And, while the card play and scoring of the parent game are sufficiently and tactically interesting in their own right, each of these additions, in their way, serve to increase the number of decision points and, consequently, the feelings of tension you will have throughout the game. Amongst these, however, partnerships are the linch-pin; each of the others ties back to this in some way. 

Partnership play, by its nature, increases poignancy as you and your partner's fate become inextricably bound and you worry from beginning to end whether it will be your decisions that cost you both the hand; or, worse, the game. Almost all of your decisions are tempered by this consideration; not only how this choice will affect yourself, but of how it will affect your partner. And it begins even before all the cards are dealt, when you are offered the opportunity to gamble, on behalf of you and your partner no less, on whether you will be the first player to void their hand (i.e. call "Tichu"). It continues into the decision over which card should be passed to which player and what signal you wish to convey to your partner about the strength or weakness of your hand. Are you positive you want to pass them the Dog and help yourself but also risk destroying what might otherwise have been an overwhelmingly strong Tichu hand for your partner? Perhaps you should keep the Dog and pass that Dragon of yours over to your partner instead? This constant pressure, however, also serves to magnify the burst of relief or joy you will feel at the end of an especially well played hand. The scoring, in particular, is excellently engineered to sustain tension and drive players to shed cards throughout the hand. It is also tied into, and re-enforcing of, the partnership aspect of the game.

Regardless of whether or not Tichu has been called, having one member of your team go out first will always be paramount. The benefits for this include the obvious potential for making (or stopping) a Tichu bid and scoring any point cards collected in the tricks of the player who went out last, but, perhaps most importantly, it also sets your team up for the possibility of going out first and second (or, "getting a Slam"). Because of this threat, after one player has gone out the pressure to shed cards remains wonderfully undiminished as you must now concentrate on going out second to either make or stop a Slam as this can result in a huge two to four (if Grand Tichu was bid) hundred point swing in fortunes for one team or the other. And, finally, while the pressure does ease off when you get down to the last two players, the scoring incentives available for not losing the point cards you've collected in tricks still continue the drive to shed cards until the bitter end. All of these objectives combine to help make even a poor hand feel somehow worthwhile as you can gear your efforts to supporting the team, be it ever so humble or cruel a contribution as to hold the Phoenix in your hand as you deliberately go out last!

And, so, to end this rather lengthy comment, I will say that after over 3 years of collecting and researching games, and after several thousand dollars invested so far, I am surprised yet delighted to find that the game I like most - far more than any other game - is one that can be played with a barely modified standard deck of cards! Heck, I'd be happy if this was the only game I owned - I like it that much. If I had gained nothing else from my time here at BGG, it would have been worth it just to be aware of this game's existence.

Un excelente juego, y más para mí, jugador de cartas de toda la vida. Lo hemos bautizado como el "mus chino".

Un juego con reglas sencillas, pero no inmediatas de entender, sobre todo en lo concerniente a las cartas especiales. Nada que se aleje de las reglas de un mus o un tute, sencillas pero con sus excepciones.

El juego por parejas es para mí el elemento diferenciador del juego, y el sistema de puntuación, la guinda del pastel.

En su contra, y al tener una curva pronunciada de aprendizaje de las estrategias, es absolutamente necesario que los jugadores estén al mismo nivel, una partida de Tichu cuando se está enseñando a jugar a un jugador es aburrida. De nuevo, nada que difiera del mus o el tute españoles. Otro contra es que sólo sea para 4 personas.

Un grandísimo juego y siempre una primera opción cuando se reúnen 4 personas que lo saben jugar.

RATING: 6
Combines scoring and other elements in Chinese card games with the partnership system of Western card games like Spades and Bridge (mostly Spades). Huge barrier to entry, and the learning curve is kind of flat after you know how to play. This means after you figure out some basic strategy and conventions, the game plays itself, much like most traditional card games.

That's not a bad thing. It's a comfort to master a game so thoroughly that it becomes almost a lifestyle game instead of something you actively try to understand, and it still provides tough decisions on how to play your hand sometimes, and it's definitely not lacking in tension and excitement, but it does lack a wide-eyed wonder which you find in other games when you defeat everybody else with some mind-blowing strategy that you can't even pinpoint how you arrived at or implemented.

This game provides fun and excitement, but it is what it is: better than almost all traditional card games, but still a traditional card game.

RATING: 8.5
Finally played with the right group. Right group = at least one seasoned player. With more pressure, focus and competition my card instincts acquired in long years of Slovenian Tarock immediately woken up and I had a blast. Goes from 6 to 8. 

So yes, before I was comparing it to Haggis and it's pretty much unlike Haggis. Some boxes are ticked by both games, but it's quite different feel. This one is about partnerships - I couldn't tell by playing with newbies, but playing it with this focus showed that's the spirit of it. Similarly to Haggis, there's this back and forth between trying to go for long combos or playing it safe and going step by step. 

Haggis is a tighter game and it has to be (it's head to head 2 player), the objectives there are much clearer and more focused (and the frequent use of bombs there gives a completely different focus). This one is more loose, but if teamwork fills in these gaps, it's much fun. Graphic design is a mess: just gimmick, no help with playing the game. Bah. 

EDIT: up 0.5 points. With the right kind of players (which include me of course) it's a blast.

I grew up playing lots of trick-taking games. So my ears perked up when I heard about this card game that many board gamers seem to revere. I took to it immediately and am always looking for opportunities to play. Though I would say this is one of those games where the group can really make or break it. I picked up the app for this one too and have played COUNTLESS games with the bots.

The game is another variation of climbing trick taking games (Great Dalmuti, Ass, Gang of Four) albeit with Partnership rules, 4 special cards and a slightly stricter structure of following a hand (You can only follow what was played previously. EG: If someone leads with pairs, you have to play a higher pair).

I think that Aldie/Derk is really trying hard to push this game, resulting in it's popularity.

Update: It's a very intense affair. Sure, the luck of the draw can give a player a strong hand but its knowing how to play out the cards. The high scores come in calling Tichu, Grand Tichu and going out 1-2 with your partner. Hence, the partnership is extremely crucial. 

The 1000 point game can take awhile to finish!

Fantastic card game that is both challenging and fun. Tichu has surpassed bridge as my favorite partnership game, and my favorite card game. One small complaint is is that the rules are some of the worst written I've ever seen (get the online version). And would it have killed the company to provide two complete decks with the game?

Update: Tichu continues to be my favorite card game and I often suggest it when I'm in a group of 4. The new edition has improved rules and two complete decks-- thanks for listening, guys. ;) Unlike some card games, you don't need a great memory to play Tichu well. You just need to develop a sense of how to assess your hand and be able to predict if you have a good chance of going out first. Oh, and you have to be able to work with your partner too!

Tichu is a tremendous trick-taking game for partners. Best. Trick-taking. Game. Ever.

Update: Now that I've had a few years' worth of games under my belt, I can vouch for Tichu's staying power. It has been a consistently fun game. There is a real art to playing with different kinds of partners, to calling Tichu, and to passing. A person can be a good partner player, yet remain poor at passing. A person can pass well, yet remain poor at going out. And even though communication between partners is not allowed, a good player will "read" both her partner and other players in order to win. If you like trick taking games and have not played Tichu, do so.

Only downside is the need for exactly 4p.  Have played a lot against ai on Ipod.  All recorded plays are live.

What I have loved is that it is so easy to get going and yet strategy just keeps revealing itself as I play.  Could be one of those "lifetime" games where you could just play it over and over.

Is the type of game that people want to play immediately after so you often play at least 2-3 games (to 1000) in a row.  Pretty darn addictive.

This game ruined my desire to ever play another card game ie. hearts, spades, etc.  I will always wish that I'm playing Tichu instead.  Recently I figured out why I like this game so much yet dislike trick taking games.  I quite dislike trumps in games, and this one doesn't force trumps.  A hand is much more fluid, and what would normally a very bad hand turns into a great hand.  Usually, every hand has three or four ways to play out your cards.  The tough decision lies in how you want to break apart what you've been given.

With repeated plays, this could go up, but for now, it's a little too out there for me to want to play all the time.  I will say that I do admire its originality.

Excellent partnership game. I love partnership games, and I love card games, so naturally I love Tichu. 

Tichu is to climbing as Bridge is to trick-taking. Granted, it can be hard to teach to folks who haven't played trick-taking or climbing games. Otherwise the only drawback is that it's 4p only. But if I'm going to play a card game with four players, it'll be Tichu. Few other card games simultaneously reward skilled play and provide as many opportunities for gutsy moves and dramatic swings.

Really interesting game. Shares many rules with Gang of Four but is plays with partnerships and has more more complex play. It takes longer, but it's much more fun (partnership play, the more interesting passing rule). 

Cards: regular 52-card deck plus...
- Phoenix: Solo = previous card + 0.5 (minimum 1.5). With others = wild card. Cannot be used in bombs. -25 pts.
- Dragon: Must be played solo. Highest single card. Trick given to an opponent if it wins the trick.  25 pts.
- Dog: No value, so must be lead. Lead passes to a partner. If partner out, passes clockwise to next available player. 0 pts.
- Mah-Jong (1): Possessor leads first trick. May use this, but not required. Lowest card in game, can be in a straight. May make a wish when played. 0 pts.

Legal Combinations
- singles, pairs, sequential pairs, triplets, full house, 5+ card straights
- bombs: 4-of-a-kind, 5+ card straight flushes; played ANY time

5 plays. Rating 7:
I played the game during my vacation with my parents and my sister. That is not my regular gaming group so the impression could be a little screwed. My mother, my sister and I all thought it was a fun game and would be happy to play it some more. My father on the other hand despised it and before the last times we played he was harassed by my mother until he caved and agreed to play. In his own words would he rather sleep.
Well, well. My opinion about Tichu is that it is a game that looks easy and simplistic but that it actually have many layers. The best part is that you play the game in pairs, that makes the dynamic in the game great and the game gets much more complex. Second, the four special card (with was a hassle for my parent to grasp) and the bombs create even more tactical depth. Downsides is that it similar to some regular card games I have played, and if you play it to 1000 points, it's rather long. I would love and will try to play it with my regular players and se if the game gets better when my father is not whining all the time...

The racist illustrations of yellow men on the cards are quite hilarious. Instruction manual is quite humorous too, like the absurd suggestion to ask a Chinese bus driver for tips on how to be good at this game.

The game seems to be a fun time, but only if you can get the necessary number of players for the game. I think playing at other player counts makes you lose out a lot on various aspects of the game. Also, it's very important to play with people who get the game, or it might prove to be a frustrating or dull experience. Probably won't be seeing a lot of play here.

Very interesting trick-taking game.  Uses a basic standard deck with 4 cards added in with special abilities.  Very fun, will have to pick this one up and play more often. Update, after 2 plays I'm bumping the rating up to "9".  One of the best partner-trick taking games I have ever played.  After 3 plays, I am really falling in love with this game.  Takes a bit of teaching time for newbies but once play is started, the game play is easy to pick up on.

I bought this in order to have some variation 
to Gang of Four while maintaining the style. 

It was a shame to find out that we could not play
it with 3. True the rules state that you can, but 
the dummy player is simply too cumbersome. 

I will re-review it when i played it with more.

RATING: 6.5
I finally got to play Tichu!  It seems to be one of those games every gamer needs to play and have in their arsenal.  I've only played it twice now and I do see what makes it endearing, but it seems like an overly complex version of Euchre or Smear.  Trick taking games are plentiful and if I play one its usually with my dad or sisters or with a few drinking buddies and I don't see the need for increasing the complexity for those games.  

So where I do see the good game in here, I also think it's unnecessarily complex, unfocused in its execution and a little silly in the rules description.

This terrific game is both a great filler and a game worth building an evening session around.  It has quite a bit of strategy to it - the four 'special' cards also spice things up and give this game a bit of flavor (separating it from its rummy-like cousins).

I can't believe I've been hiding from this game for so long. It was lying on the shelf for four years before I got around to playing it, and since then, I'm completely hooked.
It is sometimes criticised for not being very original, but hey, this is a card game people! 
The passing, calling Tichu and partner play make for constant interesting decisions. After more than 400 games, I still learn something new any game. The most replayable game I've ever played.

Quite possibly the best partnership card game--being simultaneously extremely deep in tactics while remaining easy to teach and learn.

Because it lacks the strategic depth of bidding, the game remains quickly accessible, but also suffers slightly from an increase in dependence on luck because the bidding element isn't there to help with mitigation.

That said, I will always say yes to palying this!

RATING: 7
Interesting partnership climbing game with some weird additions to (I suppose?) add strategy -- there are many to remember, but the weirdest are that bombs can be played out of turn order; the dog can only be led and passes play to your partner; the dragon is the highest single card, and worth 25 points, but if used to win a trick must be passed to an opponent; the 1 has an odd "wishing" rule; and, the big change, the goal is to go out first in a round, which scores you the last out's cards. If you predicted it ahead of time, you'll also score a big bonus.

I enjoy partnership games and this is a good one. The aim seems to have been to add depth to the card play, and the number of weird additions certainly does add some nuance to the decisions.

I just don't see what makes it so amazing that it's worth playing over, say, Five Hundred. There are a lot of great traditional card games out there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Rating based on first plays with parents and wife. Took a few rounds to get the hang of the special cards. Will take further plays to work out how best to use these cards. Calling Tichu is where the game gets exciting (just like making small and big bets in Haggis). 

I really wish they had printed the scoring rules for the special cards on the cards themselves (especially dragon and phoenix). This would make it much more accessible and easier to learn/teach.

SOLD - I just play it on Android now.

RATING: 10
This is my four player card game of choice.  The more I play it, the more I like it.  (And I've played it A LOT.)  
Tichu is a "climbing game" where players try to be the first to play all of their cards (similar to Dalmuti or Gang of Four) but it's far better than any other climbing game out there.  The things that set it apart from other climbing games are the partnership play, the subtleties introduced by the special cards, the scoring, and the ability to moderate luck through "Tichu" calls.  
Should only be played with exactly four players.  (Three is tolerable if you've nothing better to do.)  
Read the Tichu articles on my blog (http://hfog.blogspot.com) if you want to understand why this is so much better than most other card games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The only problem with this game is that it requires exactly four players. Since that's a very common restriction with trick-taking games, it's not much of a black mark on the game. This is by far the best trick-taking game I've ever played. If you don't have exactly four players, then I recommend Wizard.

Awesome partners card game. Can be played with a normal card deck and using the jokers and rule cards as the special cards needed to play. Can get very deep with strategy and is probably my favorite standard deck card game. I wish more games had partners.

EDIT: I still enjoy it but feel some rules are annoying and random. Things like bombs being able to be played out of turn order seems weird to me. Same with some rules on which way you play (clockwise / counter clockwise depending on who you learn it from). Also, teaching the game and the basic strategies is a huge chore. If it was easier to teach and explain I'd rate it higher. Plus, the fact it really only plays exactly 4 doesn't help. Still an amazing card game but not one I'll play 100% of the time unless are ready.

Played 10+ times.  Excellent game.  Lots of tension.  I have played a lot of "president" and the addition of 4 cards, partners and the Tichu rule make this a great game.  The fact that you need exactly 4 players means this comes out way less than I would like.  The random deal of the cards is greatly mitigated by the options you have when playing your hand and the way the hand plays out.  I always want to play this. **update** really don't get to play this enough. Must make more of an effort 2009/2/15

Having played only a few sessions, I am not as enthusiastic as many others. I find the special cards and enhanced bidding to be annoying additions to what was basically a fun, simple climbing game. Not sure as of yet, how much depth this really adds to the game or whether it is still mostly luck as I spent most of the game trying to remember the cards, perhaps this will change. On the good side: the game has an appropriate depth and does have interesting ideas. At this pt. I am mildly interested in playing it hence a "6" but this rating is likely to change in either direction with more plays.

Lots of lovely little nuances that make this a great card game. 5 minutes to learn and a year or two to master. 

Playing with 1 or 3 newbies can be unbalanced as 1 experienced player will almost always beat an inexperienced pair, but it is worth taking the lumps to learn.

Rating down from 7.something to 6.5 and then down to a 5. 

Update: I have really burnt out on this game and find it just frustrating and dull. Perhaps this in part (if not mostly) due to the fact that I mostly play it with Oliver who is a much better Tichu player than I am and so always beats me... :)

The game has more deept than its look like. 

It is a "normal" card game. Without the team play it wouldn`t be so good.

When you don`t call Tichu it`s a boring game. You will call Tichu after you collect expirience. So it`s a game for players, who are knowing the game. 

The problem is, you newer know, how long you would play and you need exacely 4 players. Very often one player don`t want to play more, so yoy must stop the game. The game with the most incomplete plays.

It combines the agony of "Should I play this or pass?" of President/Asshole/Great Dalmuti, the strategy of dealing with your partner, an added dash of the passing cards done in Hearts, to the Tichu bids that make me think Bridge.  Mix them all together, place on PREHEATED cookie sheet at 400 degrees for 15-18 minutes.

I'm not a huge fan of trick-taking games, which explains a large part of my lower-than-average rating.  The crazy scoring swings account for the rest.  One team can go up 1000 to 10 in one hand, and the other team can come back with a 910 to negative 100 on the next hand.  I'm exaggerating the scores a little, but it's still pretty wacky.
(Update from 5 to 7):  The more I play this game, the more it grows on me.  The depth of strategy starts to reveal itself as experience is gained.  Overall, a fun game, and one I would much rather play than Spades or Hearts.

Easily the best ladder-climbing card game going, and perhaps my favorite card game, period. Takes quite a bit of time to master, but the depth is incredible. Allows for some very, very creative play and is deep enough to hold up to endless replays. A definite desert island game!

I bought this game last week and showed it to my gaming friends this weekend. We read the rules, played two games and couldn't understand for the life of us what was so special about this game.

RATING: 7.7
A better version of President/Great Dalmuti. The fact that the deck could be made with regular playing cards is both awesome and a little frustrating.

Also, I have a feeling that people hate being my partner in this game.

RATING: 3
My rating of this game would be at least an 8, if it were not for the meta-game that surrounds this one.I don't find any other game to be nearly as exclusionary as this one; since it's only played with 4, there are many times when there is an odd person out as a result of the frothing desire on the part of some people to play this game.  That frothing desire is another reason that I've downgraded my rating of the game; it's like religion, in that I don't like what it does to people.

RATING: 8
Climbing game in partnerships, mostly about predicting who can go out first and making dramatic wagers on the outcome of hands. 

The card-play mechanism is engaging and flexible, so your hand is a puzzle with missing info, and playing with a partner makes solving that puzzle simultaneously easier and more difficult. I don't get to play this often enough (requires exactly 4 players), but it is a great game to play with two couples.

RATING: 6.75
After finally getting a play in, I can safely say...nothing.  What an odd game to try to learn--maybe because I am used to playing trick taking games, and this is more of a climbing game (whatever the heck that is).  I would love to play more, and will try to teach it to some friends.  Until then, I have no idea what to make of it.  Weird.

There are variants listed in the rulbook for different player counts, but Tichu itself is four player only game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Trick taking/climbing game in the same vein as the Great Dalmuti and Lexio.  Tichu is best played with 4.  The combinations of cards that can be played and the 4 special cards that come with the game give player a wide array of options to chose from when playing the game.  If I had to say anything bad about it, the limited amount of hand knowledge you can share with your partner is a minor drag.  If you're looking for something a little more involved than the Great Dalmuti but without the complexity of Bridge, Tichu is an excellent choice.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
By far the most over rated game I have ever played. There are some games I don't like, but I can understand their popularity. However, I can't understand the hype behind Tichu. It should be flushed down the toilet with the people who play it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is classic team trick-taking with a few special cards thrown in to the mix. I like the overall experience when played with players who know what they're doing. It gets pretty tense the more players know. But it doesn't see the table much as the player-number is limiting.

After gaining a little more experience with this one and learning how to better use the special cards, I like it more. Bumped to 8. Great fun in a card game.

RATING: 9
I believe this is the best climbing game, bar none. It's not the easiest card game to learn, much less play well, but that is part of what makes this game amazing. One the best things about it is the ability to come back from way behind. This is a card game that you need to play a lot to appreciate it's subtleties (I'm not quite there yet!). 

8-4-12 update: I have played the Android version and am loving it. I have learned so much. Now I can teach it to others for more f2f plays hopefully.

12-24-13 update: Strategy tip: NEVER give up! You can come back from almost any deficit. I was down by 900 points once and came back to win...

7-24-14 update: I've played hundreds of solitaire games on Android now, and still learning new tricks. Replayability may be near endless!

After one play, it makes much more sense...now that someone taught it to me.  I like trick-taking games, but I do lack confidence when it comes to actually playing them.  They're like bowling: I really like playing them, but am frequently not so good.  That being said, there are so many neat card interactions in this one that I look forward to playing it again.  Our first game lasted a bit over an hour, and I could have easily played twice that.  Excellent--rating after one play is 8.5.

Tichu is the best four-player game, or at least the best partnership game. It's completely approachable for new players (who may only get tripped up trying to remember the combinations of cards that can be played together). Yet the strategy is profoundly deep; after hundreds of games with serious Bridge players, we are STILL having new insights into strategy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
 I prefer traditional tricks as opposed to climbing, but the 4 special cards do add something.  A fun race to dump your hand and call your shots.  Its biggest sin is its my third favorite card game with exactly 4 players, I'm almost wishing I'm playing hearts or Barbu when 3 other people want to play a card game.


When I win I can always compliment my own play, and when my team loses its because I got stuck with a bad partner.  Its very good for my self esteem.

The luck in this game is magnified with people with the same skill level.  With 40% of your possible points needed to win being able to be scored in a single round is a bit unbalancing.  Despite the possible hand combinations, a good hand is always a good hand, and a bad hand is always a good hand.  You need big cards for controls.  Other card games I prefer have control over "which way" your hand is good. The trick is to not get too clever and overthink it.  It happens to everyone in this game though. It is still a very good card game however.    

The serious learning of the game can be hashed out in 35-40 plays, but there is always something to learn after that and it is quite enjoyable.

This is a game that everyone seems to know, but I had never played. I wasn't sure how good of a game it was really going to be.

The game is a partnership climbing game where you're trying to go out first. You have to follow the type of thing lead (single, pair, climbing pair, trips, full house, four of a kind, etc.) You can declare you're going to go out first (Tichu or Grand Tichu) which gives you points depending on when you declare it).

But there are a few wonky twists. There's a dragon card which is the highest single card. There's a phoenix card which is a wild (but can't be used in bombs) or 0.5 higher than the card it follows. There's a Dog card which gives the lead to your partner. And there's the wish card which starts the round and lets you force a player to play a number card of your choice if they can, until someone satisfies that wish.

There are also bombs, which can be played at any time, which are a natural 4 of a kind and maybe something else? And the first player out gets all the cards the last player out takes. And the unplayed cards of the last player out go to the other team.

I grew up playing card games, so this was something that I picked up fairly quickly. It scratches the card game itch, but generally I'd rather play board games with gamers.

If you want a trick-taking game with some serious strategy, you can't go wrong with this game.  This is not a casual game like most trick-taking games are, I tried playing this with my parents (who are big fans of Euchre) and it went over horribly.  This is an excellent partnership game, the more you play with the same partner, the more you understand each other's moves and can work together more effectively.  It is one of those games that I'll probably enjoy for the rest of my life.  I only wish I had the opportunity to play it more often, it is tough since it is only 4 players.

I've owned this game and wanted to play way too long to still be unplayed! Finally got to play a couple games and its way cool!

I've finally gotten to a point where I can readily teach the game, and handily win the game if the opportunity arises. I really love this card game. Having grown up playing Whist, another 4 player partnership card game, it feels very familiar, though the rules are completely extraordinary. I do admit to continually learning new things with each play. Don't underestimate your partner's play until you know why it was chosen. There can be some real surprises!

Played a couple of times with four players. Each time players agreed (and demonstrated) that it is an incredibly addictive game. It just took some effort to convince people to try it - which most likely has something to do with its generic looks (Abacus version) and the large amount of rules (for a simple looking cardgame). I do appreciate the fact that the box contains two decks of durable cards and variant rules for a different amount of players. With four players I really like it, even though the amount of luck involved really gets to me sometimes.

Kind of Bridge meets Frank's Zoo with Poker-style sets. Lighter than Bridge, but considerably more complex than Frank's Zoo. Partnership play adds some interesting dynamics, but the lack of bidding/communication limits what you can do with that. At the same time, the lack of bidding keeps it simple, so as to make it more accessible, IMO.

Honestly, I may give it a higher rating, but I really dislike the tacked-on Chinese theme (completely unnecessary). As for the game itself, I can understand the appeal, but I feel it brings out the hyper-competitiveness (it's a stressful game, and in ways that make it not the most exciting). Though maybe I'm just being a sore loser with this review (still haven't won!)

Edit: A few more games, and this would definitely be a 7.5/8 range game... partnership games always are interesting, and this game generates experiences regardless of skill. Except the pasted on Chinese theme. Gah. (I'm second-gen Chinese American and hyper sensitive to race issues, so take my ratings accordingly)

Special cards convey unique abilities when played and a card push at the beginning of each round can significantly alter hands, for better or worse. Tichu forces you to make many difficult hand management decisions - do you break-up sets to be able to take the lead or do you pass hoping you can dump a large combination later? Do you take the lead away from your partner? Is it time to play one of the "special cards"? Every round is thus dependent as much on the deal as it is the card play, meaning that tactical flexibility is necessary for success. Absolutely fantastic card game!

Finaly got to play the mighty Tichu!!  And it delivers........the ultimate beer drinking game......just enough lightness, strategy and screwage to keep you wanting more.  It is the medium in which 4 people can have a hell of a good time.  I want to play right now!!  

I can't wait to show my family......as we are a squad of four gamers plus a two year old and a husky.  I can see this becoming The Game in the house.........

1-10-10  finally introduced this to my old old friends of poker and dungeons and dragons and growing up days.....and they said it was the best game ever made...just a great time, and more to come.....i am sure so much more

We'll see.

I do not like bridge because of the pre-planned bidding systems, and this is looking like that's going to happen here.

And...that appears to be true.  Bidding system.  No thanks.  We used to play 500 where we had to read the other player and use bids to influence the other's bids.  That's fun.  Bidding systems are not.

Can run too long.  Some games are clearly just determined by luck with skill not really factoring in.  Despite these flaws, I still tend to enjoy it.  Always having a bunch of tough decisions on how to best use your cards, when to play what, etc. keep this game interesting.

This is apparently based on Big Two, which is a game I played _alot_ growing up, so I was quite keen to try it. It plays nothing almost nothing like Big Two, in that the strategies are completely different. That said, this game is very good and it's a lot of fun trying to get Tichu. The only problem is getting 4 people who like to play card games.

First impression: standard trick-taking card game with a few oddball cards added.  The added cards just disrupt normal play. (rating: 4.5)

After playing 10  times: I could have never imagined there would be so many different ways to utilize these cards.  Every round of this game is different and exciting.  The only way to succeed is to be agile, and ready to try adapt strategies.  I think it has as much depth as Mu, which really is saying a lot. (rating: 7.8)

After avoiding this for many years, I finally took the time to play it, and confirmed my suspicion that it really is just another boring card game.  Sure, there's a gimmick here in the climbing mechanism, but even that's just like [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6748/scum-the-food-chain-game]Presidents and Assholes[/url], a public domain game that's been around forever.  Basically, you take the bidding aspect from trick-taking games, which I hate, and make the game play less intuitive.  Sure, maybe this is some people's cup of tea, but I hate card bidding games.  This one is no exception, and is even more annoying when it is played by gamers who know of better games and want to play this drivel anyway.

Mostly played on line. The best tric-tracking game that I know of, except bridge (but getting new partners to play bridge is much more difficult...).

A game that has a bit of a learning curve, added to some randomness. Can play fast (though I hate BSW players who just say fast. I mean. Brains off or what ?)

Fun, addicting partnership game- is basically an elaboration of chinese poker, wherein you are trying to get rid of your cards by playing "poker hands" (exluding flush and including some others that don't apply in normal poker). I love playing this one online where there's no shuffling, dealing, or physically having to pass cards involved. I feel that in order to really appreciate the game, you have to have a grasp of its subtleties, so it is difficult to get non-gamers into it (or at least that has been my personal experience).

RATING: 5
To compare climbing games with trick-taking games is a disservice to both, so I'll avoid any of those comparisons.  Tichu seems to have a large learning curve, which puts novice players at a disadvantage.  I would still like to play it more, to see if I can begin to understand the subtleties of the game, but after a few plays, I seem to be far behind the standard.  I can also see this being a case of whoever draws the best start hand is the winner, if all players at the table are at the same skill level.  Odd.

Tichu wasn't as impressive as I thought it would be. Still, I enjoy it mainly due to how fast it is to get a few rounds going. It has some depth to it, to be sure, but I find that many rounds pass with one person plonking down 4 cards and everyone else going "pass". Perhaps, we are doing something wrong. Still, I'm giving it a respectable 7.

Partnership climbing card game -- object is rid yourself of your hand. The deck is a standard 52-card pack with four special cards added. When it's your turn, you may either beat the current top card combination or pass. If play passes all the way back to the player who laid the top cards, he wins the trick and can lead the next one. The card led determines the only combination of cards to be played on that trick. So if a single card is led, then only single cards are played. If a straight of seven cards is led, then only straights of seven cards, etc. The last player out gives all the cards he won to the player who exited first, and the last player's unplayed cards are handed to the opposite team. Fives, Tens and Kings are worth points, with each hand worth one hundred points (without bonuses). The first team to 1000 points wins.

Een slagenspel dat het meest doet denken aan presidenten.

Twee teams van twee proberen als eerste van al hun kaarten af te zijn. Dit doen ze door combinaties van kaarten uit te spelen die een hogere waarde hebben dan die door de speler voor hen is gespeeld.

Ik snap de popularitieit van dit spel niet. Het is opzich wel grappig, maar het spel voelt helemaal niet natuurlijk aan. Er wordt geprobeerd een combinatie te maken tussen voor jezelf gaan en teamplay, maar je zult zien dat je toch vooral voor jezelf aan het spelen bent, terwijl het toch echt een teamspel hoort te zijn. Geef mij maar klaverjassen.

Typical deal and draw - all luck. After you play a ton of games of Tichu you figure out the several strategic decisions to make and numerous missteps to avoid in order to better you and your partner's position ... and you also realize none of them mean squat because the outcome of the game always hinges upon one central flaw: if you don't draw anything, you can't do anything. 95% of the time a round/game of Tichu is simply a contest of drawing high cards because without them a player can never have a legitimate shot of going out first, barring god-hands. Get dealt Aces. Get dealt special cards. Get dealt high pairs and long straights. Get dealt bombs. Get lucky, and don't screw up after you've gotten lucky.

The passing of cards and scoring system of Tichu are innovative and give the game a unique twist, differentiating it from other climbing games. The partnership aspect of Tichu also makes the game more interactive.

Having 14 cards does limit the hand types and reduces flexibility somewhat, as does the limited types of combinations.

The artwork of the uplay.it set is gorgeous, though the card stock is on the thin side.

The pattern setting is very reminiscent of a card game called Capitalism that I used to play, which I didn't really like due to how shallow it was (not to mention it is very difficult to rise in position when you have to give your best cards away).  However, with the inclusion of partnership, the well designed special cards, the differences in scoring, as well as the addition of bomb, certainly made this trick taking game fun and worth playing.  I'm a big card freak and I can't wait to introduce this to my friends, I'm sure this will probably become a staple whenever I can get the chance to play it.

Hooked through the nose by the end of the third hand.  Tichu is quite an interesting game in that the hands have a tendency to even themselves out due to the passing of cards.  Lots of good stuff here.  If I had three other regulars, I can see playing tons of Tichu.

Incredible card game.  I like the bombs.  I like the four animal cards.  I enjoy how the game really incorporates the power of playing with your partner against your opponents.  This is one of my all time favorite card games.  However, no one in China knows how to play.  I would say, "Buy this game", especially if you have a group that loves to play card games.

What a great trick-taking (ok, ok, "climbing") game!  There are a lot of subtle nuances here.

RATING: 6
[gameid=40171] is most similar to this amongst the climbing games I've played.  Partners: interesting dynamic in the game.  Dog: a little strange, but it works well.  The procedure for the end of the hand is a bit uncomfortable, but it's what makes [gameid=215] [gameid=215].

I dislike classic card games. Neither trick taking. But this one is special and so the only one I admit to replay. Fun and challenging, can be tense and strategic. No doubt that many people may love this chinese game.

Jópofa kártyajáték, megfelelő mákkal, de azért eléggé gondolkodós is ahhoz, h ne érezzük annyira erősnek a szerencse szerepét. Sajnos igazán jól csak és kizárólag 4-en játszható, de ha van hozzá társaság, akkor megéri beszerezni.

After 20+ Plays: A great partnership game.  I don't tend to like partnership games, but if I did this would probably be a 10.  If I could, I'd make everyone in Indiana forget they'd ever heard of Euchre, and this would become the card game of choice for hanging out with friends and family get-togethers.

Non-standard trick taking game that can sometimes baffle long time Bridge and Belotte players. If it was not for the really cheap card stock the AS edition has.....i will probably go with an 8.

The single most played game in my collection. I usually team up with my daughter against my wife and son. We record the scores, and are on our third notebook. This is our default family game - if we can't agree on what to play, we play Tichu. 

I love this game, despite being wretchedly bad at it.

Is very popular among friends, and allthough I like to play it once in a while I still can't get a grip on it. But maybe that's the purpose ...

8/14/13 - Rating 7:  Pretty good, for what it is.  It's a little tough to understand at first, which I think is its main drawback.  Possibly better for couple's night rather than gaming with the boys night.

PS:  A Gang of Four is long gone and this has stuck around.

---Previously---

I played this one night, and afterward thought that Gang of Four was better, although it's clear that my experience, and therefore my ability to lay down arbitrary ratings, is limited.  As it is, I leave you to decide for yourself which you prefer.

A quick playing soccer based dexterity game that comes in an extremely large cardboard box.  Make sure that you have a place to store this before you buy it.

RATING: 6
Chaotic and tough to control, but a nice change of pace. Better for small kids who can't play Crokinole well, the chaos works to their advantage. Somewhat of a splurge purchase (even on sale), figuring my kids will enjoy it.

Wood Air hockey (or soccer).  This isn't a flicking game but a dex game.  And a damn good one.  Loved it!

RATING: 6
Love this game! I describe this as air hockey without the air and a few more rules. I only play with the simple rules located on the back of the instruction booklet as the heavy rules might tend to bog down an otherwise fast game. Everyone I've introduced this to loves it, especially my wife which is always a good thing. I'll play this any time. Great way to start or finish a game night.

RATING: 6
This is very fun for a while, but gets monotonous after a game.  Perhaps with more skill it would be less monotonous and more tactical.  This game certainly deserves long breaks in between sessions to get the interest level back up.  I dislike that unskilled players just aim to knock the shit out of the ball and hope it goes in.

RATING: 7
Oddly entertaining.  The flicking is hard to control so it seems pretty random to me, but perhaps we were just awful at the game.

Great dex game, you can flail around for a while without getting anything done in it.  So, it does take practice, but it's worth it.

RATING: 6
A very high quality production dexterity game that simulates an abstracted version of soccer via flicking discs around.

Each player controls three pieces on the board, with the goal of flicking them into a piece that represents the ball to hit it into the opponent's goal.

Overall, good flicking fun, but I wasn't overly enthused about it for some reason.  I'd rather just play something like Crokinole or PitchCar if I'm going to be doing some flicking.

The design is very cool. The powder makes the pieces glide across the table like air hockey. The problem was that we scored more own goals than proper scores. We also both constantly had our players on the wrong side of the ball. Lacked the instant pick-up-and-play fun of other table soccer games.

It could be my current dexterity fetish phase, but I really liked this game.  I now need to convince somebody that they should buy it.

This is probably the coolest dexterity game I own.  There are so many great shots you can make with this one, it's bound to be a hit if you can ignore the price tag!

UPDATE:  Okay, Crokinole is now the coolest dexterity game but this one is pretty good...

RATING: 8.5
Awesome dexterity game, that is well made and lots of fun to play and has a fair bit of strategy to the game also. The disc slide very nicely on the board and the game has a nice soccer/hockey feel to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Feels sort of like a cross between Crokinole and Pool, although I don't think I'd ever choose to play Zopp over either of those games.  Zopp requires *much* more precision than Crokinole, which can make the game frustrating for those who are anything less than expert flickers.

Zopp is a cheap retread of Subbuteo with an airhockey flaire.  I found it was easier to own goal than legitamatelly play the game with any true skill.  The ease in which the pieces fly around really adds too much chaos and detracts from the tedium of setting up tactical blocks (thus cheapening the experience).  I'd still play it time to time and enjoy it, but Crokinole is this game to the tenth power.  Heck, just go get some Subbuteo pieces and play the REAL version of this instead.

RATING: 7
Zopp is a very speedy and dynamic game. The game combines the Billiard and the Football. Occasionally, Zopp is compared to other dexterity games, such as Tumlin-Dice. I guess Zopp is far better than others. For example, Tumlin-Dice is more likely focused on children. Sometimes, that is a bit boring and tedious for adult. However, Zopp is joyful for all ages. Even adults can fully enjoy Zopp. Zopp is one of the best dexterity games ever I've experienced. In my opinion, Zopp, Crokinole and PitchCar are the best three dexterity games in boardgames.

Indoor soccer on glass dust.  This one has provided many hours of enjoyable family play over the years.

RATING: 8
Pretty cool game, especially once you use the mespi powder - the surface acts like an air hockey table.  I can't imagine playing Crokinole on a board that smooth because the pieces just glide too easily.  

Being only an amateur at games of flicking skill like Crokinole, I find Zopp to be a little above my skill level.  The precision required is a little beyond me and at this point I just try to approximate what might be the best angle and hope for the best.  I suspect that those with a strong billiards background might do better, but I struggle to get the game to do what I want to do.

That said, I feel committed to keep trying and improve my game.

Impressive production.  The game is OK.  Nothing wrong with it, it just seemed sort of pedestrian.  For me, since I already own Crokinole and Carabande, I see no need to add this to my collction.  I'dprefer to play either of those two games.  But I would play Zopp if asked.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Superb dexterity game with high quality components. I really enjoy that the game is highly tactical (more so than Crokinole imo) and you need to try to think couple of steps ahead all the time. Despite being themed as a "soccer" game, Zopp actually feels more like ice-hockey thanks to plenty of corner battles.

Expensive but fun. Ok if you don't use powder, but when you do use it, the pieces fly like magic...especially the red one :)

Bought it after reading Neil Thomson excellent review of the game.

Update bought myself today (3 december 2007) a wooden board from an icehockey game for five euro. (only the board the other pieces were missing) Perhaps I won't use it but if something happens to my Zopp board i have a replacement. The game is rather pricey  so to have a similar backup board sounds good.

Only had one play and think the rating of 7.5 is fair. I want to play it more and will sometimes take this with me when I visit family to have a fun game. Or suggest it when just one friend is visiting.

The only downside is that it is a really a 2P game.
Comparable games 
Pitchcar up to 8 players (allthough this can take to long)
Hamsterrolle up to 4 players (very little downtime)
Bausack up to 10 players (allthough this is too much IMO)

I paid 67 euro for it (around 100 US dollar exchange rate at that time was one euro = 1.48 US DOLLAR)
And if you can get it at that price and like dexterity games I can recommend it.

After first impression: what a wonderful game. Tactical ice-hockey game (I really think this is ice-hockey not soccer), where everything can happens. Use the stick or fingers... the choice is yours. Some house rules needed, but they are quite obvious I think. This and Crokinole are the best dexterity games I've played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played once.  Given my incompetence at dexterity games, this was a surprisingly fun game.  It really captured the feel of air hockey crossed with pool.  The puck couldn't glide as far as in air hockey, so each player needs other pieces to use as attackers/defenders.  Definitely a game that I would play again, with a better understanding of some of the rules (they rules explanation was weak).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Beautiful construction and great quality board and components.  It's almost like "billiards meets air hockey" with a soccer theme.  Rules probably need a little more clarity but this game is so open that it invites rules tweaks and variations from game group to game group depending upon fairness and tastes.  Lots of fun with the right player(s).  Great dexterity alternative to Crokinole and games of it's ilk.

Absolutely brilliant.  More social than Carrom, more engaging than Crokinole, greater variety of shots than Carabande and simpler than Subutteo.  Great stuff, now just got to find my own copy.

Add another game to the pile of big expensive games I'll probably never own. I'll especially never own this one since while it's a good time, it can't compare to some others in it's class (crokinole, pitch car).

RATING: 4
Yeah, it's cool, but you have to rate the game, not the equipment. The extreme volatility of the pieces decreases the value of "setup" moves, but you need to make setup moves regularly because you routinely end up with all three of your pieces on the wrong side of the ball. The offsides rule is either flawed or poorly written; if my opponent hits one of my guys into their goal, then I have to waste a turn taking that piece out? That's uncool. Maybe if you own a table, this is great, but for a casual pickup game, I'd look around for something else.

Ah Zopp...think Crokinole except this is played with a soccer field type set up with the walls protected by a layer of rubber so the ball/disc thing zips aroud like crazy.

Other major difference is that each player gets 3 flicks using a small tick each turn to help set up the ball ready for a shot on goal. 

It's cool in theory and I like it but...the skill factor is much higher than a Crokinole and therefore it can be hard to find opponent's willing to put in the time to develop the skill to make the game interesting and competitive.

RATING: 8
Sure feels a bit football but definitely has more ice-hockeyish touch. The board is enormous and can't be easily taken to anywhere. Too bad since I'd definitely want to own this game.

In our couple of first games, we made more errors than successful shots but that didn't prevent us from having a great time.
I've played only 1v1 version. I prefer it to the teamplay, because it gets you more involved and it doesn't matter how skillful you are.

Too bad that these big dex games aren't available to play too often...

This is a great dexterity game abstraction of soccer.  Enough rules to add some dexterity and tactical depth, but still easy enough that anyone can enjoy this.  I find this appealing in a manner similar to SoccerTactics, despite them being completely different games.

Yes, there's the magic 'Zopp' powder. But here's a secret: Use talcum powder. Makes the discs fly too! Yes, it may make the board look 'messy' but just use a wet cloth to wipe it down after.

Update: Got it! Now for a copy of Piratenbilliards...The game is a cross between ice hockey and football/soccer. Players use a stick to flick one of three pieces in an attempt to put the red disc into the opposing goal. You can set up defensive positions to draw fouls or to position for a better shooting angle! Fun! Quick and rewards repeated play!

This is a fun flicking dexterity game like Crokinole but with a soccer theme.  The bouncy edges of the board make for some crazy and unpredictable results, but that just adds to the silly mayhem that ensues with this game.  I played it four times in one day and look forward to playing it again soon.  I still prefer Crokinole, especially because it allows for both 2-player and 4-player with teams, but Zopp is very good flicking dexterity game in its own right.

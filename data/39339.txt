Tentative rating after just one play - I instantly fell in love with this. The combination of Euro-style scoring mechanisms and deep theme were a hit in our first and only 2-player game.

Update: Played again, this time with three players. I feel like the amount of VP given for correctly identifying the killer is somewhat too high and tends to devalue the efforts made throughout the game - after all, there is a considerable amount of luck involved in placing the clues. But then again, the game itself, its theme and mechanics make it more than worthwile to spend hours on it...even if someone else wins to his own surprise because of one meagre clue point on his guy. I stand by my rating of 8.

[thing=39339]Android[/thing]: 2-5 players (4+ hours).
The theme is excellent, with a beautiful board and with a lot of flavor text on the cards (you can decide yourself how much to read it during the game). All characters are unique with some of their own character-specific rules, personal storylines to finish during the game (happy endings give victory points), and their own demons to avoid when solving the case. There are many different murder cases to play. There is a great atmosphere, and although the board and the sheer number of tokens may at first intimidate you, the game mechanisms are actually quite simple when you have played once. Each game takes a long time (5+ hours for your first 2-player game), so stay clear of this game, if that is a problem for you.

I wish I could get this played more than once a year. :}

I remember how excited I was when I heard about this game - how cool it looked. Then, I read reviews and decided that I was better off staying away. Well, a few weeks ago and years later, I happened to find a copy for $20 - what the heck? I though to myself - how bad can it be?

Well, its actually a pretty bad game. It wants to be thematic - but its really hard to get into the theme when there are so many things on the board. More than that, the game-play itself is very repetitive. It just didn't feel like... anything. 

If you want a story-game, get Tales of the Arabian Nights. That game may not have strategy but it can offer a great time. If you want a cyber-punk game, get Net Runner. 

Android is an academic curiosity at best. An example of how not to do theme in a game. As such, I enjoyed it - but don't get it if you're looking for a fun gaming experience.

RATING: 6
Amazingly detailed and complex world. Android is almost like playing 4 different small games simultaneously, and watching the ways in which they interlock is fascinating. There's the "whodunit" aspect, the personal development arc of your character, the AP system, the "conspiracy" puzzle (an ACTUAL PUZZLE built into the game board), and the ever-present time limit all coalesce to form a very unique experience.

The reasons I rated it lower than my praise may suggest:
1) The guilt/innocence of suspects is arbitrary. You're simply attempting to "frame" who you think is guilty. I think the game would be improved by actually having a guilty party, and adding dynamics for convicting them.
2) Complexity, rules-lawyering, and the time sink. This is a game on par with Twilight Imperium, Firefly, and Risk in terms of it's time commitment. I enjoy this game, but I rarely get it on the table for this reason. On top of the time sink, it takes a good 30 minutes (at least) to set up the game, and even longer to explain it to new players. Once you grok the rules, it's a fairly smooth game, but the initial learning curve is steep.
3) Bits. It's a FFG game, so you know there are seventy trillion small pieces. The board can get somewhat chaotic, and the footprint on this game is massive. We needed two tables to accommodate a 4 player game. 

If you want a hearty, deep experience requiring a good chunk of time to get lost in the narrative, get Android. The personal plots for each character are interesting touches and make players more invested. The mechanics work, and the art is fantastic. Just be aware of the learning curve and time requirements, and you'll have a great time.

Great game, different from all the other games I've ever played, very unique, I'm a huge fan of Android: Netrunner so I already know the Android universe premise. This one is a game about investigation, conspiracy, prestige and individual storylines. My first game had a huge downtime I thought, but the other aspects of the game I enjoyed.

RATING: 9
It is busy, and takes up a tonne of space, yet it is exceptional. The board itself is a blend of intertextual appropriation and functional iconography; add-in components and variously-sized cards with full art. It looks like a labour of love already. 

Mechanically, there's also a lot going on. However, I think for the fiddliness, the central mechanisms are brilliant and overcome the chrome. How the game asks you to frame a suspect inverts a lot of expectations of your typically inductive gamer. On top of this, the control the players have over narrative development through card play is sophisticated. Android draws you in. 


The dynamics of the role-playing detective mean I'd really want to play this with 3, maybe 2. There's too many chits lying around with more, but overall, it's about intimacy. This is a game where the world is bigger than the players - you don't 'win' in the conventional sense, but you will find a greater level of satisfaction in the result than most other games.

People dump on this game, and although it's complex and basically playing 4 games at once, I like how all of the different elements work together. It can get a bit too nasty and cutthroat, sometimes, so it's probably not for everybody. Another one of those games that you really need the right group to play with, and sometimes with a lot of time, I might go to something else before I go to Android.

RATING: 3
In a way Android reminds me of another Kevin Wilson design, Arkham Horror.  It feels like in both chrome has been trowelled on to mask the fundamental simplicity of the game and make us believe it's worth several hours of our time.

In Android you are moving around the board picking up stuff, while playing helpful cards on yourself and unhelpful cards on others. Framing suspects (by picking up lead chits and drawing evidence chits), guiding personal stories to a happy conclusion (by picking up smiley chits) and collecting favours from two mega corporations at least offer some choice of focus. 

Framing suspects is the most painful element of the game.  Thanks to the random evidence chit draws, you can pay a lot of attention to it and come away with nothing.  Ignore it and watch someone else rack up a game winning score.  Wouldn't it be simpler to just flip a coin? 

Another element I dislike is the yawning chasms between turns.  However, you can't play a side game, read a book or make dinner because you need to be paying attention to your cards in case an opponent makes the play of one possible through their actions.  And another thing; only knowing how to give a player bad baggage by asking them is really poor.

The gravest sin of all for a game with so much chrome is that Android never comes to life thematically in the way that Arkham Horror does.  Its core, the murder mystery, is hollow, it never gets beyond move, pick up stuff, play cards.

RATING: 7.9
I'm really not 100% sure about the rating.  It's based upon one play (4 player) and I'd need to play it again before I can make a really good judgment.  But my first impressions were that while it's got some weaknesses, it's both beautiful and rich - a winning combination.  It's a long game though - nowhere near the 180 minutes they claim.  Our first play was six hours and only one player was taking a long time over decisions - everyone else was really pretty quick after the first couple of rounds.

A true to form FFG game - fiddly, involved and gorgeous, with a hefty dose of [i]take-that[/i].

The game revolves around twilight cards and to make strategically sound decicions you should have a good overview of them. However, this is a 4+ hours game and I can't see myself playing this very often, so learning the cards might take a while.

Cyberpunk + BoardGame + Anime art = Android
This is probably the best production fantasy flight has put out. From the box cover to the cards, board, counters, and rule book everything has been put together with attention to detail.
The rules are very clear and well ordered (seriously fantasy flight what's happened ;) ) The theme is piled on and the underlying game seems solid.
I'm this impressed even before playing it and that rarely happens! In fact I'm going to rate it now as a 9 without even playing... that how much I think I will like this.


Just played a two player to work out the rules and while fun it appears that the game could suffer some serious downtime issues in the learning stages. 
Also I think this has even more fiddly rules than Arkham Horror as each player has little exceptions here and there.
Rating lowered to an 8. I imagine it will stay around here.

Now have played 1/2 a three player game rating lowered again. This is disapointing.

Played a full 3 player game. It went much faster but still had major downtime issues. I think if more dark cards could drawn and held it would help this a bit. Still I'm going to persevre and play it a few more times as while some elements are horrible there are other that are really fun.

Played a 4 player.Took 5 hours for a full game so we're getting faster. Downtime STILL an issue, but players weren't drawing huge amounts of dark cards. Maybe reducing the time used each day and extending the number of weeks would improve things. I really want to like this game more :(

I've upped my rating to seven after a very enjoyable game that only took 4 hours including an explanation. Played light and fast this is a fun game. Let the mood wash over you and enjoy the ride. Vangelis in the background is a must.
Upped again to an 8. 3 hours ticked along nicely. Each time you play you peel back an extra layer of this game. Dark cards keep you in the game on other players turns and you must constantly be looking at your cards to work out what to do on your turn. 3 players is the sweet spot.

This game is a hidden Gem. There are no in between folks. Either you will love this game or hate it. The mechanics and play style of building a story of your character while trying to find out a conspiracy or murderer is simply amazing.

In other games you play a role in a predefined story. In this game, YOU are the story.. the game unfolds as you discover your characters and become part of the tale.

Absolutely fantastic.

This game has a reputation for being far more complicated then actual game play.  The basic mechanics are actually fairly easy.  Game play is highly thematic and if played as board game driven RPG can be quite fun.  The only odd or forced mechanism is the negative cards played against others.  There are times when the cards make perfect sense and fit the story and then there are times when it just feels mean to the opponent.  The game should be approached as a story game and an experience, not as a strategy game.  Play with folks of like mind and enjoy the experience.  Save the competitions for chess or something else.

How can you possibly rate such a shambling behemoth after one play?  Not well is the answer.  It's longish (3 hours for 4 players + 45 minutes of rules).

Mechanics are strong.  "Take That" elements are well implemented and don't feel capricious.  A strong experience game with the potential to be tactically interesting as well.

Will require learning the characters to become a good player, but that may remove some of the experience.

Quibble.  The "story" is specific.  So rather than having generic events that you fill in with your own imagination and story, you have specific characters and specific actions, which I feel will ultimately become repetitive.  I personally would have preferred a more generic iconic approach to the cards rather than the specific world-building approach FFG took.

A brilliantly epic game that will leave you and your friends telling stories for months after each play. It takes a while to play so you won't pull it out on a whim, but it really works as an EVENT game.

It's a mix of mini games and 'take that' while solving murder and conspiracy. It's really good, but players have to pay attention to the mood of their characters, otherwise they can lose everything in depression (with a little help from their opponent). People have to be able to handle quite heavy 'take that' mechanic, otherwise, they shouldn't play this. It's also not short and can take around 3 hours easily. But if people get over these things, there's a great game to be found.

Very thematic with various story aspects..true, it is not a deduction murder case, but if you see through that, it is a really nice game with so much flavor and perfect components..basic negatives are the looong playtime plus the feeling that maaaybe getting to know all the personal stories (granted, it will take several plays) might spoil the whole fun..remains a cool one nevertheless.

RATING: 8.6
Almost a perfect game. I rated 8.6 due to a bit of unnecessary complexity.

The atmosphere is brilliant. The stories are good, I'd like some more or different mechanics to convert favors into vps, and the thematic concept of a "favor" does not appeal well to me. I like the "arkham horror"-style board with the buildings of various uses and the personal character stories are a great addition to the game. The conspiracy puzzle provides some extra scoring conditions so it is also a useful element, although I disagree that you should be awarded vps for completing a line.

This games confuses me. I would like to rate it a 9. On the other hand it is probably the most confusing rules-wise game I've played. Some mechanics could be refined to offer the same gameplay with less complexity. And this comes from a person that LIKES complex games. Don't get me wrong: I like the fact that lots of things are going on in the game and I wouldn't like to see them reduced. However, in this level of complexity a game requires PERFECT mechanics. I rate the mechanics a 9/10 so overall the rating of this game drops from 9 to 8.6

Essentially Blade Runner: The Board Game. This is a weird game - as others have commented, it's like a Euro area-control game (investigation) hiding underneath a thick veneer of theme (moving around the board, personal stories, etc.).

The personal-story stuff works relatively well if you're getting into it - but the mechanism for it is counter-intuitive. The guilt/innocence part doesn't feel anything like an investigation - which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but does break the immersion in character quite a bit. The conspiracy part with the jigsaw is a nice idea, but thematically seems detached from the rest of the game and exists really just to score bonus points.

The main problem the game has is that - in keeping with some other Fantasy Flight games - it's a fiddly beast with a million pieces and it takes a long time to complete a game... which in itself kind of puts me off playing it. Which is a shame, because it's a really nice idea and so close to being brilliant.

This is one of those games where the story told by the game is more important than the actual outcome of the game. Don't get me wrong, there is a pretty good game here with challenging and fullfilling gameplay. But the biggest part of the enjoyment comes from the narrative the players create while playing. It's too bad that this nice storytelling sometimes gets obscured by layers and layers of mechanics which do work gamewise but do not always help the narrative. There is a pretty big take that feel to the game. It's not as bad as some reviews may lead you to believe though. If you read the strategy guides provided for each character, you can avoid most of the bad stuff that can happen to you. If you're into theme and storytelling games this game could be one of your favorites. If you just like to play to optimize your score and beat the game system this game will almost certainly fall flat for you. I for one love this game and appreciate the ambition and love that went into it. Even if the game has its flaws.

This game was painful.  I cannot see how the elements, when tied together, lead to any amount of fun.  The backstory is adds no value and takes up space on cards and player handouts. Not sure what I would change to make this game a fun experience. Would never play again.

An epic future story world that is more an experience than it is a game. Role players will enjoy it mostly because the heart of it's game play is developing the character's background through card play.

The game falls short as a game in its mechanics. Players can manipulate the scoring and steer outside the theme just to win. Because of this, gamer players may want to stay clear of Android.

I want to like this game more, as I love the idea, the theme, and some of the mechanics. But the various elements, and particularly the conspiracy puzzle, just don't gel together all that well. Some of the dark cards are just too crippling to be fun and you don't always feel like you have control over the murder mystery. I'll play it more for the experience than for the gameplay.

That said, I'm happy the Android universe is getting love in other venues.

The only good thing about this game is its different from most games in that you don't really know who is winning till it ends. It has lots of optional paths toward victory which is nice and plays fairly well. The rulebook is a nightmare, but once you get it all figured out it plays pretty easily. But all and all its not very fun.

Like a lot of people, I find it hard to get past the apparent framing concept.  Another game I've created a half-decent solo version of.  Evidence tokens are placed face-down at the start, and the player reveals them instead of placing them.

Has beautiful design and board layout.  Some great new mechanics - I love the conspiracy section.

RATING: 5.5
A very dynamic game that seems somewhat broken.  The large point swings (15-20 VP) from finding suspects guilty/innocent overshadow the rest of the game.  You can spend time (actions) to advance your character's storyline, to move and plant evidence on suspects, to build puzzle pieces that might provide direct VPs or VP-modifiers and to play cards that directly harm another player.  The balance of good actions and bad actions is well done; after playing a card that is really good for yourself, you'll need to play bad cards on opponents before you can play another good card on yourself.  The main problem with the game is that it's really tough to do well if you don't earn points with your secret suspects... and it's not easy to ensure that your suspect will finish the way that you want him/her to.  It seems dumb that the evidence planting is done in secret when you have almost zero incentive to play evidence (either positive or negative) on anyone other than your 2 secret suspects.  Collecting guaranteed points and largely ignoring the evidence-planting is a sure fire way to lose the game... so I don't think there are multiple paths to victory... I think you must stay involved in the evidence planting to win but it's all just a crapshoot of who gets the best numbers to plant at that point.

I didn't realize how complex Android was when we initially sat down to play it.  I still would have played because I wanted to try it and I value the friendships of the guys who invited me, but I should have prepared a little by reading ahead of time.  I was really overwhelmed with options and didn't recognize what I _SHOULD_ have been spending my actions on during my turn.

My Arkham Horror comment is apropos here:
I am NOT an Ameritrash fan.  Way too many rules printed on cards and game pieces that all interact with each other in confusing and forgetful ways.  And this game takes for freaking ever!  I was trying to be nice in offering to play this, but I was such a poop about the whole thing I'm sure it was just as much a miserable experience for the fan who wanted to teach me as it was for me to play it!

I really like this game; I think it's innovative, original, re-playable, gorgeous to look at and great fun with the right group.

RATING: N/A
Looks quite interesting.  I've heard that it's quite love-it-or-hate-it, but I'm looking forward to trying it.  I like that it seems that it's more about crafting a story than solving a crime.

I still have not pulled this one out and done a learning game.  I'm not usually bothered by complex rules and fiddly bits but there's a lot to this game and the rules don't jump out at me screaming fun.  I know this game will fall flat with at least two of the people I play regularly with so I have not been in a rush to learn it.

Well, I still have not got this to the table even for a learning game.  The fact that it's best with 3 and still a long game is a detractor, as is the hefty manual and fiddly mechanics.  To the trade pile with you!

Traded away without ever playing it, due to lack of interest.  I'm becoming less tolerant to bloated games with weak rulebooks and mechanisms.

The game has a lot of flavour and some interresting mechanics. Sadly the main mechanic of collecting and placing evidence is the one mechanic that lacks flavour.
Behind all the special cases and exceptions the game mechanics seem to be rather simple. This is not really a problem however, as other story based games get away with ithis too. Here however the story does not quite carry the game.
Overall the game is fun, however when you tend to wonder during play if the games core mechanic could be replaceced it´s not the best of signs...

RATING: 3
Tried once with original rules and once with Director's Cut.  Director's Cut fixes the original broken rules for the conspiracy puzzle and makes the murder investigation more thematic (not THEMATIC mind you, just more so).  There are some great ideas here - they just need to be split up into at least two different games.  Great theme, but you can hardly enjoy it due to all its' unthematic mechanical elements.Play time is too long at 3 hours plus.  Lots of downtime between turns if playing with four. I Would not even consider five players.

Es un juego temático ambientado en el universo ciberpunk. Cada personaje lleva un detective que tratará de resolver un caso de asesinato. Siguiendo las pistas, podrá descubrir además una conspiración en la que estén implicadas entidades relevantes. Además, tendrá que ir "luchando" con sus propias historias.. cada personaje tiene sus propios problemas y tendrá que tomar decisiones al respecto.
En cada turno los detectives tienen una cantidad de puntos de tiempo que gastar en diversas acciones. Cada turno representa un día de juego. La partida dura dos semanas. Al final de cada semana, se resuelve una historia personal.  En cuanto al asesinato, durante la investigación, el detective puede "apostar" por alguno de los sospechosos, colocando sobre ellos "evidencias". Al final, el que mayor valor tenga (sumando el número del reverso de la evidencias) es el culpable. Cada detective tiene una carta de culpable e inocente. Recibirá puntos si resulta al final que su carta de culpable coincide con el culpable desvelado al final de la partida.

Está bastante entretenido. No es complicado de jugar.. las mecánicas son muy sencillas. El gran mérito del juego es el tema. Es un juego muy cinematográfico. Es como ver una peli. 

Se supone que es de 3-5, pero a dos, por lo que opina la comunidad funciona sin problema. Eso sí, son cuatro horitas de partida.

Wasn't crazy about this game. The cards seemed way too punishing- I spent easily half an hour building up points to do one action, and two steps before reaching the square to do the action I had everything wiped out by one card. I was like "what's the point?"

That said, I liked the theme, and I was also sick when I played this. Had a real sore throat and didn't finish the game- turns out it was strep throat and I was out of commission for the next 4 days. :(

RATING: 6
Great theme! Love the idea of following three completely different ways to gain points: the murder, the conspiracy and the private life. A game where characters feel like real personalities: they have to make decisions that really matter...like sacrificing your private life and see your marriage broken to pieces because you spend all your time hunting a murder... 
The board is a piece of art...one of the best I´ve ever seen.
Still, it feels like the great concept is not completely developed to a full smooth game. In addition, the lack of support by FFG is a shame. Without expansions and new characters, replayability is kind of limited.
Still, I keep it because it´s so special and you feel the ambition in the design.

2-Player variants to try:  Quoted from forums

2p with the normal rules and it works just fine, but instead of number_of_player+1 suspects we have +2 (4 suspects). it's harder to find out the other's hunches and easier to bluff
Or

A classic way to play 2 players is for each player to play 2 characters and your final score is either the total for both or the lowest of the two.

If Raymond is in play, the other player should receive 2 memory cards, to balance the absence of the third player.

We keep drawing an event card until one turns up that applies to the current selection of NPCs or is in some way relevant to the game. Another way of looking at this is that we remove all events that apply to NPCs that are not in the game - but we are too lazy to actually sort through the deck and do so!

Fun and thematic.  An exploration of the life of a detective in a cyberpunk universe centered around a murder and conspiracy plot.

Android is one of those games I want to love, but I just can't.  Yes, the narrative elements in this one are innovative - my problem is that the game underlying them is deadly dull, and not hearty enough to hold the weight of 2-3 hours of play.  I'm not one who is pissed off that the murder-mystery element becomes more about framing a suspect than detecting them - my issue is that this process is boring.  You basically have the main mechanic of the game being the manipulation of number values on a chart with 3 areas.  Other than doing that, you'll travel around and add a piece to the conspiracy "puzzle" every once in a while (also a dud in terms of fun), and you'll work on your personal issue subplots.  The idea of personal "baggage" and moving your character through choose-your-own-adventure style quests is the most interesting element in the game - but after a few plays, the novelty of this has been exhausted, and during those plays you want to focus on this element because it is the most fun, but it's not the focus of the game.  I think in all honesty what is at heart a Euro like this just can't hold the weight of all that narrative - most boardgames are not meant to (nor can they) tell compelling stories.  This one had promise, but at the end of the day I'd rather play a game like Arkham Horror.

RATING: 7.5
The game that finally got me to start liking Netrunner. Though I had played the LCG over a dozen times, I never really understood or got into the theme. Once I played Android, I couldn't get enough: I pulled out my old Netrunner data packs to read the flavor text, and even began reading the Android novels to learn more about this cool futuristic world. 

The story element is unlike any I have ever seen in a board game. Your character has a backstory, their own friends and connections who occupy the board and can even die, and you get an entire plot line that changes from game to game. Your characters literally collect psychological baggage that affects their productivity and has a significant impact on the events of the game. The result is that the game really draws you in, and you actually start to get attached to your own character.  

The game is long, though, and mechanically, it's a bit of a mess: memory is a hugely important element, which I'm not a fan of, and most of your success in the game relies on lucky draws (evidence chits and character cards). Nevertheless, the game succeeds brilliantly in its creation of story and atmosphere, so much so that this is one of the only games I own where I don't really care who wins.

RATING: 3
I enjoyed the experience in parts, but the overall downtime was frustrating, and so was the "take that" nature of the gameplay in a 4+ hour game.  The other thing I don't like are the highly specific "take that" cards, which require a person to have certain things, or meet certain requirements in order to screw them.  If you're going to let me screw someone, let me just do it.

I wouldn't play with more than 3 people.. the downtime with 4 or 5 would absolutely kill me.

RATING: 6
There are far too many things going on. I felt like I needed to take my time and read all of the flavor text to really get into the game. But this was made difficult by the number of mechanics and the length of the game. That said, I enjoyed my one playing in part due to the people. If I was able to play this many more times, I think it would become more natural, but I don't think it will even make it to play #2.

A giant odd mess of a game. It's really a number of interlocking games all happening at once. Some are very story driven (trying to solve/pin the murder on someone and your personal character arc), while others are entirely mechanical (the conspiracy puzzle).

I thought this was a great game. Some people don't like the fact that there isn't a "guilty" person as in Clue and that you are fitting someone up for the crime but I just take the view that just like real police you gather the evidence and are leaving it up to the courts to decide which person is guilty.
There's a lot going on in the game and it is pretty complicated with a lot of ways to score victory points. However I think it is one of the better Ameritrash games I have played.

Dear FFG: it's okay to make a game without nasty fuckyou cards; there are other ways to encourage player interaction. Still, big ups for trying something new and nearly pulling it off. Cool story, background and flavor text. I want to play again so I can find out whether the tantalizing possibility of an interactive-novelesque experience is realizable or if it's just a VP-chaser smothered in layer of prolixity.

Heavily thematic tech-dystopian noir.  Carve out an hour or two to grok the 48-page rulebook, and sort the pieces each player will start with.  At least one hour per player.  Not for the masses, but for fans of the theme there is little equivalent.

RATING: 6
Great theme and some unusual and inventive mechanics. This is definitely a long game to play with a full complement of 5 (each day taking about 25 minutes once players have figured out the rules). I'm not sure why it's called Android as only one detective is non-human. I really like each player's special abilities (disabilities?) such as Floyd's 3 prime directives which he can eventually break. The flyer arcs are very thematic, too. Much better than a simple ruler. The several ways to score VPs and the amassing of evidence make the leader difficult to determine until the very end. Requires a play through before you really understand how it all fits together. It's tough playing such a long game when you are pretty certain you are way behind but then there aren't that many games with a cool Bladerunner theme!

Ultimately, it's one of those really long games where you can still win in the end by flipping a coin. 

There are some really neat things going on such as the car movement mechanic, the light/dark shifting mechanic for playing cards, the guilty/innocent  area influence hunches that are 'secret missions' and the neat plot progression.  However, these mechanics are cobbled together in a clunky manner and fail to produce much of a 'game'.  The tokens you collect (which may be too hard to acquire) make you think you need to have a long term strategy to succeed but the dark cards can destroy any hard fought for progress to the point that long term planning is essentially useless. You could spend the entire game focused on putting a hit on somebody and never get it accomplished because you keep getting screwed with.  For me, its' not satisfying to set out on an objective and never come close to achieving it.  In fact, it's downright frustrating and a reason why I won't play it again.

What the game essentially boils down to is running around the board chasing evidence and taking advantage of tactical point scoring oppurtunities. Long term planning is a recipe for failure and even if you put yourself in the best position to win, a lucky card/bag draw can swing the game by upwards of 20+ pts on the last turn.  As a side note, I feel I could really love this game if the dark cards were more of a deterrence/hinderance type of screw your neighbor and not so much of a "set you back 3 steps" destruction of process.  And dark cards that trigger on going to major locations are garbage.

I'll get this someday, but it's never the game I'm going to buy /rightnow/ because the play time is so long.  Love the theme, and what I've heard about the mechanics impresses me.  It could really use some sweet plastic minis though.

Slow game, lots going on, but very fun.  Played with 2 players - more players is really going to bog it down I think as there isn't much prep a player can do while they are waiting for their turn.  However, players are engaged in whats going on during other players turns - opportunities to play dark cards for example.  Overall very  fun, very thematic.

What a game!
I have playde this a few times now, and I'm still learning how to handle that beast. Its full of stories and atmosphere but first you have to dive through layers and layers of rules and mechanics. About one and a half hour for set up and explanation with new players. The game itself then takes about four hours.
Your gaming troupe needs to be commited to enjoy. Otherwise the experience is bound to be a frustrating one.
Play for the stories in your first rounds. Dont play for winning! It is hard to keep an eye on who is acctually doing best, thus in the end it often turns out that you where hindering the wrong detective.
The more often you play the more you will find strategies that enhance your winning chances.

*Works with 2 players, just use 4 suspects.

Very long play time. Good theme and story telling. General game mechanics are a bit loose. Not really about the murder/investigation itself, but the life of your detective over the course of the case. 

The point-based winning or losing is just a side note at the end.

Received this from a friend as a Christmas present!  Can't wait to try it out.

[b]Update:[/b] Played through part of a game, and I'm really excited about it.  I'm not sure about the rest of the game group, but we'll see.  A bit of a learning curve, and it was a late night.

RATING: 9
Tough to rate.  I absolutely love the theme.  I also really like that each character has a personal narrative to explore while there is simultaneously a global narrative that unfolds.  It really brings the characters alive and creates an attachment for me similar to role-playing games.

However, I don't like the action point system.  That can lead AP prone players to take a *long* time on their turns, which means Android will drag out for quite a while.  I'm also not sure about the Twilight card help/sham mechanism.  In principle it's fine, but because you have sham cards, you have to pay close attention while the other players take their long drawn out turns.  I would almost rather not be engaged during another player's turn.

In the end, though, I just like the theme and the cardplay enough that they overcome the other issues.  I feel like this could be a template for a similar game which is maybe a bit more streamlined.  I've seen it described as a multi-player fantasy card driven wargame, and that's not too far off.  To play well, you would need to understand your character's specific deck.  I'm hoping to play it quite a few more times, which says something given how long it is.  If it pans out for two players, then it will see even more play.

A tad disappointing since it didn't play the way I thought it would; I was hoping for Cluedo with a Bladerunner feel to it but got something else instead. It still is a good game but I feel that while there's a ton to do in the game it lacks something gameplay wise. I totally love the characters though - they feel very much alive and the whole thing about how there are different paths that they can take as well as different personal endings is just awesome. I'd recommend everyone to play using the fan-made Cluedo-like rules though (available in the Files section).

Two plays - a 5 and a 3. Both way too long for what this game is.

Too much take-that card play, and the cards seemed way too swingy. The designers hoped to offer many paths to victory, but instead, it seems your character mandates the way you should play the game, rather than offering a choice of strategies.

This game does not get enough recognition. My god.. this is a work of art. The theme is present in every mechanic. AND IT WORKS! Be careful what table you play this on though.. it has a huge footprint and may stain your table with awesome. 
Just remember.. you have to separate YOU the player( who plants evidence and shapes the conspiracy) and YOU the character(who has hunches on who is guilty). I think this is what most people can't appreciate.

This is an excellent, innovative, deep, complex game.  I really enjoy it.  It is not without its quirks - it may have been better has the designer left out the conspiracy puzzle portion of the game, playing faster and tighter - but heavyweights like this are my favorite kind of games.  This is a long game, but it is easy to quickly grow comfortable with the actions and turn sequence.  The main drawback is that there is a lot of down time between turns; I recommend you play with 3 players instead of 5 unless you have a lot of patience for it.

Great game with lot of player interaction but long player turns. It's a long game and has to be played couple of times to fully understand the beauty of the game and flavor and to be playable in 3 hours :-).

First play was amazing. Everything I hoped for and more.

I thought the writing waas quite good, at least I was very intrigued by how the Bioroid, Floyd, was relating to the world.

I wouldn't call this a "Who-done-it?", more of a "Who is the best at manufacturing evidence?" kind of game. Pretty dark and cynical feel which fits brilliantly with the genre.

Tells a great story. Can be a bit complex though especially with new players. Typical FFG polish and chrome on components and art. Set in an amazing bladerunner cyber punk style universe. I really like this one and it's very different from the other games in my collection.

RATING: 5
Oh god, how much I want to love this game but can't.
This is a mixture of great mechanics what at the and fails to being a good game.

+:
*Light-dark twilight cards mechanic forces you to use both because of the light-dark shifting. Great idea to motivate every player to play both. This causes  a good amount of confrontation.
*The plots. Such an elegant way to tell a story to every character which can be very different in game after game AND have an effect on end game scoring too.
*You are building a puzzle during the game (conspiracy part)

-:
*Overwhelming. You have too many options. I don't think any of them is bad but this game is like you add 3-4 expansions to the base game together.
*Way too long. One of the longest game what I ever played. Usually I have no problem with that but my group does.
*Downtime. You can sit there for 10-15 mins easily without anything to do. Especially with 5 players.
*Too many tokens, components etc. This makes setup a long process and hard to store the game. Also requires a lot of table space.

Overall I feel this game has some excellent ideas what should be implemented in other games too. On the other hand if the designer wouldn't want to put everything into this single game could end a better game.

RATING: 6
An interesting game... So far I've only played 2 player (with four suspects) and 3 player. I'm a big fan of theme in games and in some respects this game has it in spades. The individual characters are well themed but the "mystery" aspect of the game just doesn't hold it together enough for me. I do suspect that knowing the game better will create a different (better) experience. But it's going to take a loooong time to have played it enough to know the game. The game runs a bit long for my liking (although familiarity would likely speed the game up though. However ultimately I find I don't enjoy the "take that" nature of the game and I can't imagine playing this game with four people let alone five.

This was a bit too complex for its own good. I had the bad luck to draw all my cards relating to the conspiracy after it had been completed, but I suspect this was a fluke. I am perfectly willing to give it another go, and I suspect it's going to be much more understandable the second time around.

RATING: 6
My rating so far is based on just one play and may go up or down. I am still deciding how much I like Android, but so far I like what I see. The game just oozes with theme and it looks like there are many avenues to victory.

There is a lot to take in on the first play. That is not to say that the game is overly complicated, but there is a lot of different subsystems to learn. Also, each character seems to play completely different from the others. Being a wargamer that is used to exceptions in games this is really not that big of a deal. You just need to be willing to put some time into learning the game.

I am looking forward to trying this again.

If you are into short little euros with pasted on themes then don't even bother. If you like like long theme laden games then this might be the one.

A very unique game with a myriad of components and way to score victory points. It has a LONG playtime (we took 5 hours for a 5 player game, all but one of us noobs), but if I am playing a 5 player game, I'd rather play this over other FFG games, say......... Arkham Horror.

You are a character in a dystopian future earth, trying to investigate a crime. There are 4 main ways to score VPs: (1) trying to incriminate the suspects you think are guilty and protecting those who you think are innocent; (2) progressing your character's personal storyline; (3) discovering parts of 'The Conspiracy'; (4) gaining favors and spending them to get in the good favors of the corporations.

A very unique game, and if you are in the longer games crowd, a winner.

Only played once, so my rating might change upon future playings. My overall feeling the first time is that it has great theme and ambiance--and it would be great fun with the right group of people. I played it at my FLGS with a friend and a family consisting of a father & his two sons--needless to say, the family was a downer. If you did something to one of them, they all jumped on you, rather than playing the game and following with the theme. That made it less fun than it could have been. So, I'm hoping that future plays with my own gaming group will yield a better result.

Only played one incomplete game. Everyone was intrigued, but the lateness of the hour combined with the game's enormous scope and detail made it a poor choice for that particular night. This will need a few more plays before I can formulate an accurate rating.

Update: Finally got this to the table again for a 3-player game. My first full game; the others had played before, but not for some time. A little over four hours from start to finish; there was a lot of brushing up on rules in the first 90 minutes, but then everyone was up to speed. It. Is. Amazing. Yes, it's a collection of many discrete elements (mechanics), but somehow they all work together to create a unique game experience. I guess it's a bit like Karloff's monster in "Frankenstein"... he may be stitched together from many different sources, but he's his own unique individual. I can't wait to play this again.

Not primarily a game, but a rich story-telling experience with a bunch of innovative and fun mechanics that blend together well if you manage to remember them all. Don't get me wrong, this is the opposite of streamlined, first couple of games is just for wrapping your head around it, only then can you begin to make informed let alone strategic decisions. Also, everyone should have read the rulebook prior to their first session, explanation alone takes roughly 1,5 hours. Definitely not "we'll learn as we go". Our first game took 8 hours over the course of two evenings (including me explaining this glorious mess), but it was well worth it, with everyone agreeing that it was one of their most memorable gaming experiences.

Played half a game.  With two people, it is a pretty pointless to-and-fro pushing the clues between locations.  There isn't any real conflict, nor any race element, you just bimble around the board collecting guilt/innocence markers.  The only gameplay part of it I enjoyed was the placing of these; spread that out over 3-4 hours?  No thanks.

If I met a group that wanted to play, I'd give it another go to be sure, but I wont be suggesting any time soon.

If you approach Android strictly as an victory point optimization game you'll probably be disappointed by the disparate systems and potential viciousness.  I approached it not just as a game, but also as a story, an experience, and greatly enjoyed it.  Maybe that won't last beyond playing each character once or twice, but at that point it would probably be tighter and more strategic.  Still, it feels more like an experience than (just) a game.  Reading the flavor text aloud was very helpful.

This game is great with the mechanic is so novel! It's truly masterpiece in design, so many interwoven things that hard to separate mechanics and theme (except the conspiracy, weakest mechanic-theme link). All in all, the theme is so great and drenched, by the time you finish, you would be drunk by cyberpunk noir detective situation. The only downside is the downtime between player, without clear possibilities to formulate strategy in other players turn.

No other games quite like it. Very original so kudos for that.
However, it's fiddly. Having to memorize your hand of cards so you can "interupt" the other players with a card play when they step on some specific space is annoying to me.

Also, i hate Floyd because he's not carefully balanced. Many of his dark cards get him trauma, yet he can't gain trauma. His plots are also super-easy to achieve compared to other characters. Negative baggage is very though to put on him and positive ones are super easy, making it not worth the hassle.

I enjoyed exploring the storylines, but the gameplay felt somehow too simple and not very exciting. It also felt like you were playing 3 different games at once (finding evidence for your guilty hunch, playing out your personal storyline and connecting pieces on the conspiracy puzzle), with little connection.

Due to the abstract way of scoring, it's also very hard to track how many victory points people had, or were soon to receive. This made using the 'dark cards' a bit useless, while I would've loved seeing some more action on this part.

Interesting game. You move your investigator around the map and collect favors and evidence as you build your case. The catch is everyone else is doing the same thing, so you don't know if your hunches will be correct, which is a big deal given their VP value. You can mitigate it somewhat by talking to a couple of NPC's.

Meanwhile, your investigators have their own issues (plots) that are resolved as the game progresses, and these are also worth VP, and can be negatively affected by your opponents through the play of "dark" cards. Finally, there's the conspiracy board, which is a bit wonky, but can also be worth big VP points.

The whole thing is very thematic and the universe is pretty cool. I'm convinced that reading the flavor text and getting into the setting is crucial to enjoyment of the game. If nothing else it gives you something to do during downtime.

There's also a fan created "director's cut" set of variants that may appeal to some folks.

Update: After more play I've had to accept the fact, like so many others, that I like [i]idea[/i] of this game more than the game itself. For all its theme, the mechanics aren't that evocative given the density of the rules and result in too much down time with 6+ actions per turn, especially if someone at the table suffers from AP (and someone always does). Plus, the effects of the dark cards are too wild at times, with some cards nearly useless while others are brutal hosers. I do think that the Director's Cut variants address some of the issues regarding the disconnect between mechanics and theme, but come at the expense of adding more complexity to an already overworked set of rules.

I liked it more than I was expecting to, but maybe my expectations were overly lowered by the negative reviews.  There are lots of things that should make me dislike it (length, downtime, take-that, hidden voting), but somehow I enjoyed the experience despite everything.  Maybe I just like games where each player has different powers and goals; it's fun to just chase your own objectives even if you have no chance of winning.  I also give it credit for not being a cooperative game, as is currently fashionable, and also for having ridiculous amounts of chrome yet not being based on a licensed property.  The information overload just from the game mechanics was too much for me to pay much attention to the story, but I appreciate that it's there (and I like the theme).

Quite simply, there is no better "story in a box" game than Android.  If you approach a game of Android as a VP-hunter, you've already lost the game; this is narrative-driven gameplay with victory points only used as a measuring stick of success at the end.  This is an epic game that will take the five wildly different characters on different journeys, all in the pursuit of their own goals and schemes.  It's a time investment to be sure, but this game takes the concept of "winning" and turns it on its ear in a satisfying way that never fails to be memorable.  If you value narrative in your games, and you're not afraid of a time commitment, this is one of the best.

Gosh, this game has some great novel ideas and mechanisms but it's too baroque. The developers didn't know when to quit! Great theme too, but too long and overly convoluted for the payoff. Recommend with 3 players, and doubtful about a fourth even with veterans. We tried with 5 and it was torture: too much to track, too much downtime.

A detective noir story set in a dystopian future.  Android isn't really a murder mystery;  rather, the game is about the detectives and their character development, with the murder mystery serving as a convenient framing device.  As with any good noir story, each detective has various complications and baggage in their lives, and all five of the characters play very differently and have different things to worry about.

An odd and often misunderstood game. Much like Betrayal at House on the Hill, it's more about the experience than the actual mechanics, which are odd, to say the least. However, if you just roll with it I think it's a satisfying experience. Seeing your characters story play out over the game and the after game conversation makes it all worthwhile.

RATING: 5
It's a mixed bag...  some stuff is great:  the theme, the basic concept, the artwork.    Some stuff is not-so-great:  the twilight cards, the location mechanics that don't really fit.   In the end, it's a long game with a heavy screw-your-neighbor element, so that means it won't be popular or see a lot of plays.   With some polish, this could be a good game.  It's very cinematic, and there's nothing quite like it. It's too bad that the murder mystery plot wasn't thicker, and the character sub-plots less dominant.  In practice, they are actually weighted in reverse from how it should have been.   This game could be an "8" or "9" with some development.   As it is, it seems to have been released prematurely.

This one is a keeper. It has one of the most interesting gameplays. 
However, NEVER play it with less than 5 players. These two leads missing make a huge difference. The same is true for the one character missing, as he would otherwise pick up (and thereby move) leads. We played with 4 players, and felt the drag of having to move further and further.
Also, NEVER play "Revenge at the Races". The Dark-shifting will slow down cardplay, leading to a less interesting game.
I'd also strongly advise thinking about playing "Mons Wolff Massacre" (increase in VP for Guilty hunches can wildly swing the game, probably out of balance) and "Last Call at Roxie's" (the possibility to kill more easily not only makes the game more frustrating, it can catapult players out of the game very easily).
The lead movement in "Murder on the Midway" could also swing the game, but I'm not sure if this would be felt harshly. And I don't see many problems in "Freetown Fright". So I would recommend playing these, or just the standard scenario, every time.

RATING: 6
Good, I think.  This game is like that one ex-girlfriend who was beautiful and passionate, but also a complete mess who just couldn't seem to keep it together.

Alternately, this game is a stunning labor of love, but with too much love and not enough labor.

Anyway, I'm out of cute metaphors.  Overall this is phenomenally hard to rate.  Some parts are a 10, some parts are a 4.  Clearly a game that rewards intense, repeat plays; but also so limited in its appeal (sci-fi noir, long playtime, complex rules) that it's hard to see how it will get the plays it deserves to really shine.

One response to a bogus criticism:  This game is NOT about "solving the mystery" in the same sense as [i]Clue[/i] or [i]Mystery of the Abbey[/i].  There are no absolutely true facts of a crime to uncover.  So people who complain that placing evidence on suspects isn't "thematic" are missing the point of the game.  You can view this two ways:

(1) Your character is actively trying to frame a suspect.  It's a dark future, get over it.

(2) My preferred way: Things that you (the player) do are not necessarily things that your character does.  You are guiding your character through a story; the unstated assumption/insistence that there must be some kind of one-to-one mapping of your actions to your character's actions is simply not true.

I really enjoyed the theme of this game.  It is Space Noir!  The play is a bit chaotic.  And there was a tendency to pile on the "percieved" leader.  I really liked the individual plots that led to victory points.  It gave the game added depth....

Well, I thought I would try this since I have new found love for FFG.  In the end I didn't enjoy the game but I suspect that I should have known.  I don't feel burned by it and I was glad to have tried it, but in the end it's rated so low for two reasons: 

(1) Our first session was about 3 1/2 hours which is small compared to what others have reported.  So, the  game is long but it also feels really long due to the large amount of downtime in the game.  The worst is you have to pay attention during people's turns otherwise you may miss the opportunity to play a dark card on someone.  I don't mind the 'take that' elements of the game but when you lose your whole turn then the downtime becomes even worse again.

(2) I felt that a lot of the areas on the board were not worth the time investment compared to simply going and following a lead.  This could definitely be my own inexperience talking but spending 4 favors (each favor is technically worth about 2-3 time) plus extra time to put one hit token on a suspect just doesn't seem worthwhile.  Now I know you probably won't use this at all unless you're the character that can get these through light cards but I just didn't feel the balance.

Overall I liked that each character plays completely differently and you will even have some variation from game to game with each one.  It also has a great story going on and a lot of interlocking game mechanisms, some of which are new and innovative.  In the end, I likely won't play this game again due to the downtime but at least I got to experience it once.  I'm also grateful that it was the inspiration for personal stories in the Arkham Horror expansion Innsmouth Horror.

Games take forever, but I don't mind because of the gorgeous theme and and components. This game was a labor of love, and it shows. There's enough flavor text on the cards to write a novel.

Android is not a game for people who want to churn out an engine of victory points or spend action points with maximum efficiency. It's best enjoyed by those who want to sink into its theme and sacrifice some "better moves" for the sake of experiencing the game.

[1 play] Interesting game, with the scope, complexity, and fiddliness of Arkham Horror or Battlestar Galactica.  Our one play had 3-4 new people taught by someone who was on his 3rd play, so very much a learning game.  This is the sort of game that has a significant learning curve, so that you can't really get to whatever it has to offer unless you have a core of people interested enough to be willing to suffer some front-end pain.  It took us an hour of rules and then just over 5 hours to play.  

The alleged deductive element was one of the things that attracted me, but there wasn't that much of one.  There's a murder-mystery theme, but you don't so much solve the murder (by figuring out who actually IS guilty) as try to make whoever you want be guilty.  The deduction probably enters in more in terms of figuring out what your fellow players are trying to do and what their secret goals are, and that was a level of subtlety we were not prepared to cope with on the first time out.  It really seems like at first you don't have the knowledge to play the game very strategically.

Another problem with this kind of game is that one of the strengths of the game is its theme-richness and immersiveness; however, when you're blundering through it for the first time and it's taking forever, one of the first things you're inclined to sacrifice is reading the flavor text and so forth.  But without that, you lose something that makes the game enjoyable.

Probably the most interesting aspect of the game to me was my individual character and her plots.  Each character has a set of possible subplots about their personal life story that you try to make end favorably.  If I had it to do over again, what would have been most helpful to me would have been, before the game, to read all the character sheets, for a better understanding of who everyone was and how they interacted.  It's also useful to see what advice the other characters are given about how to combat your character!

I would probably play this again.  I definitely would if I had the chance to either play with people who knew what they were doing (though the newer player would likely get destroyed in that case), or play with people who were committed to playing a few times.  This game could be good if you got past the initial learning curve--how good, unfortunately, I'm not likely to find out.

RATING: 4.5
Not bad, but not good either.  The components are great, and the game would be really fun if it took 45 minutes instead of 4 hours to play.  The amount the other players can mess with you is completely exhausting.  The "puzzle" feels tacked on and completely removed from the gameplay.   And why did that thing need to have jagged edges, except to guarantee that the pieces would fall apart?  This is the first game where I want to try one of the fan variants.

This is more of a role-playing board game, if anything. I totally went into character without problem. Solving the murder actually didn't occupy me as much as trying to make sure my character had a nice date and found happiness. Absolutely have to try this some more.

What a strange game. You can tell it's definitely a 'labor of love' type thing and not a game for everyone. While I think it is possible to try to play to win, it's more about the experience itself.

It helps that I love the Android setting.

I put it in the "ambitious failure" camp but not without interesting aspects. The Blade Runner theme, asymmetrical characters/powers, and plot choices are inspired. Depending on circumstances, your character's plot can go different ways with different effects and endgame VPs. But then the game degrades into some laborious VP chasing with a take-that card mechanism that feels tacked on in order provide at least some type of player interaction. 

I see FFG doing reboots of game franchises these days and I’ll be curious to see what they do here. IMO, they should make this a 1 v Many game like their other franchises. At the least, I think it should be a mystery to solve or not (as in Mansions of Madness) and throw all the VP crap out the window.

Thoughts: love the theme, the game has been quite fun so far. Only complaint: rules are easy but brutal to learn. It falls into quite a few games (many of them Kevin Wilson designed) where the rules seem like they are introduced in the most complicated way possible, only to be a lot more simple than they look.

Way too much fiddly for too little awesome. This game would be great if a computer were keeping track of all the little rules. But it's too much work for a casual boardgame.

Difficult to rate. Would like to play more. I like what it attempts to model, and I have no problem with it not being a deduction game, a widely voiced and irrelevant complaint about its design. On the other hand, I dislike that the token pushing, which undermined the flavor for me. Repeated plays might mitigate this criticism. A related problem is that the very simple Euro-inspired mechanics play out in slow motion while one's choices seem weirdly constrained. My first impression was that cards don't synergize well or in particularly interesting ways (this might be unfair).  The dead locations on the board fail to add drama; they instead add to the game's playing time. A consequence is most of what's dramatic about the game is offloaded from the board and on to the flavor text. At the same time, much of the game seems intent drawing attention away from the cards and to the less interesting bookkeeping aspects. Will play again with more than two players.

Obviously a labor of love -- seems that a lot of thought has been put into this one. It has well-written flavor text, fascinating references to all sorts of genres, a few innovative mechanics. Its limitations are those of any adventure boardgame; it has enough of a game going on to have at least some replayability even after you've seen all the cards.

Such a painful game. A powerful game in terms of theme, art, and concept, but ultimately a flawed playing experience.

Really enjoy the theme of the game. Very long, but it's clearly more about the story than the mechanics of the game which for the most part is a lot of Take That cards.
In this instance this isn't a bad thing, the character setbacks fit the noir feel. You may spend more time focusing on ensuring your characters story turns out well, or perhaps descend into depression whilst seeking to get your suspect or figure out the conspiracy. Whatever way it plays there's a great story arc for each player by games end.
That's what makes this game.

Not a mystery solving game. The goal of this game is to get invested in your character and help him/her through the game as best as possible. 
There is a lot of tension when you have to decide between resolving your plot positively vs going for more points somewhere else. Just like in real live you can't succeed at everything. This is really an rpg game.

I always play with our house rules that allow for all the players to take their turns simultaneously. Feels like there is more of a time crunch make sure you keep those dark cards in mind. This same rule also makes those dark cards seem less like a personal attack played by a bunch of hungry vulture players and more like a bad card in a game of munchkin just a plot complication that adds fun. Try it out!

After a second play I don't really get this 'game'.  There is a lot going on which is fine, but another player and I agreed that you spend more time focusing on your own goals rather than stopping someone else unless you happen to have one of their cards.  The other player remarked best: this was a fine 'experience', but I don't know how good of a 'game' this was.

We played with 3 both times, and would not recommend going beyond that as it would add too much time, and this game is already a time commitment as is, our two games were 4 hours including rules both times.

The best part of the whole experience is when I accidentally knocked the leg of the folding table, and the whole game, chits and all, crashed onto the floor.

This game is too long. That's its fault.
But I do think that played with the right group, and having the right amount of time at your disposal, it makes a great experience.
You need to:
- enjoy the theme
- take time to get into the setting (read the stories of the detectives beforehand)
- have enough time
- read the cards aloud
- don't play to win.

You will rarely play another game like this.
It's not perfect, but it's unique.

Surprisingly, I'm really glad I got this played.  It's quite cool.  Unfortunately, so much of the love that went into this game is entirely lost on me.  I'm just not the target audience for this.  The core of the board play seemed rather simplistic and dry.  The card play is rather unique but I'm not sure there's that much of a game there past not doing stuff that will get your character screwed.  Highly recommended to the people who actually enjoy Fantasy Flight flavor text, but I'd recommend the rest steer clear.

RATING: 3
Just played it for the first time, and I expected to enjoy it much more than I did. I generally don't have a problem with games that have a long set-up time and many small pieces as long as all those pieces and all that setup contribute to the theme in very tangible ways.

It's such a shame that a promising game like this struggles in so many ways. The attempt to blend luck and tactical play only manages to be frustrating, although I don't know if the deck can really be considered a luck element with so many repeat trash cards. I was very excited about my character when the game started, but after cycling through half my deck, I found her abilities tedious at best. I had already deduced the other player's hunches, and yet I was stuck with 3 cards that allowed me to look at the evidence tiles on one suspect.

The board is also irritating. At first I found all the names charming, as well as the idea that various locations were primarily corporate, political, religious, etc. However, the filler-spaces in combination with the finicky and time consuming movement restriction made me begin to dread my oncoming turns if only because I had to use that stupid half-moon movement piece. The only satisfying use for that piece would be poking other players who take too long on their turns. For that purpose it excels, because it is quite sharp.

I'm sure I'm not the only person who expected this game to feel like an interactive Bladerunner. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Somewhere in between moving your Time track, adjusting the Day track, keeping up with all 4 Favor token types, all 3 Lead token types, your own Light-Dark track, various event cards and the deadening, sunken, reeking mire that is the Light and Dark cards, it became a chore to read the flavor text. When we did bother to do this, the descriptions were repetitive and frankly boring. Oh, the poor Bioroid is struggling with hate crimes and his own newborn humanity? Oh no, look! The Psychic Clone has a crush, but her helicopter boss is making her sad. Allow me to wipe away my single tear.

The common defense of this game is that the theme should not be the murder you're investigating, but instead the characters each person is playing. If that is the case, why does the game rely so much upon highly abstracted, Euro-esque mechanics? Euros with such clunky mechanics would be an abject failure at its core, and while I can understand clunky mechanics that add accuracy to an Ameritrash theme, so many of Android's mechanics are not. Why is it necessary to have 4 types of influence, plus the occasional Wild? It ceases to effectively add theme when the players want to strangle themselves.

I really do want to like this game. I intend to try it again with 3 players and see if that makes a difference, because with a theme so promising, I would be welcome to the idea that my initial judgement was unfair.

Very shiny and appealing, but ultimately fails to play well. There is an overload of information on all the cards and personal plots, and this information is not accessible enough to play fluidly. Despite the large amount of fluff, Android still manages to be very repetitive with lots of downtime and it drags on forever. Very relieved I managed to sell this.

This is not what you expect it to be!
It is not a murder mystery à la clue. 

It is a storytelling game not unlike Tales of Arabian Nights. If you know that going in, the stories are quite well crafted and come out well through the gameplay. Unlike Tales however this doesn't push you towards the story so you have to actively take the time to savor it. If you don't and just play this mechanically you won't enjoy it one bit because at it's core it is a mindless conglomeration of completely random events.

If there is such a thing as being too innovative, this game is it. There are so many new mechanics to wrap your head around that it makes play much clunkier feeling then it should be. Having said that, this game does have a lot of potential and there are a lot of interesting ideas used here. I just wish it was more streamlined.

RATING: 6
The setting for this world is a lot like Richard K. Morgan's Takeshi Kovacs novels - a mixture of Philip K. Dick and Dashiell Hammett.

Pro: The three separate divisions of the game - the murder case, the conspiracy, and the personal lives of the detective characters are superbly done. The light/dark mechanic, the puzzle pieces, the car rulers, and the mechanic for setting clue locations are all interesting. The theme and artwork are  excellent 

Con: The game is very reading intensive and the text on the cards is small. This is one game where the flavor text really matters and the small italic text is difficult for my 50 year old eyes to read. This is really the only major negative I see to the game but its a big one. This cost it at least 2 points in my rating. The sheer amount of color on the board can render the evidence markers hard to see. I believe this would make it difficult for a color-blind individual to play.

The bottom line: I enjoyed the game and would like to play again but I will need advance warning so I can bring a magnifying device to read and enjoy the text parts of the game.

RATING: 10
Best cyberpunk boardgame ever. I don't quite understand why this game got such low scores here on BGG; I suppose if you're looking for a "whodunnit" kind of game (like Clue), you'd be sorely disappointed. This is a different kind of game where you follow your "hunches" about who is the real culprit while trying to cope with personal problems (which is the best part of the game IMO). Really really cool.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Oh boy oh boy oh boy!  Smells like the movie BLADE RUNNER.  3 to 5 detectives go on a mission to solve a murder in a dystopian future with not one but TWO megacorporations who make near-humans.  The rules and results are a little abstract; you don't find the real killer as in CLUE, but it is more like you are cynically "framing" your preferred suspect.  The "conspiracy" section of the board is the most abstract, just a random game of Bingo.
The Plot Cards are the best part.  I wish Joss Whedon would make actual TV episodes out of this...

This game has a terrifically well thought out cyberpunk world with just the right tone of film noir and science fictional extrapolations. Theme (or fluff as some may call it) is integral to the game's underlying mechanics and is not just there to draw in those of us that like the near future setting. Fantasy adventure boardgames may take us on the Campbellian journey of the hero, but this is the closest I've felt to really playing my character in a boardgame. Yet, the game also has some very strong strategic elements (action points, hand management, area control, etc). One warning, if you are looking for Clue(do) or Mystery in the Abbey, look somewhere else, this is not a deduction game in the traditional sense.

RATING: 7
9/28/09 - 1 play - I bought this game when it came out because it is totally my kind of game.  But it's been almost a year now, and I've only gotten it on the table once.  I think this game is very situational.  If you have the right group of 4 or 5, and everyone is in to the theme, and you have 4 hours to play it, and everyone gets into all the little storylines, I think this game would be great.  But until I can prove that, I'm not rating it any higher than 7.

Way too long and too complicated, not so much fun. Dark cards can be very powerful and influence strongly the gameplay. It's very difficult to follow the play of the other players. I played it once with 4 experienced players, but we simply gave up halfway after seven turns and 5 hours. Fine bits (tons of, in true FFG style!), beautiful gameboard. The whodunnit theme is very thin however.

This game reminds me of a Choose Your Own Adventure book.  The game focuses much on each character as an individual with their own plot lines.

I probably want to like this more than I actually do. Android is an ambitious project, and while it ultimately doesn't quite achieve what it sets out to do (combining different euro-style mechanics in a thematic setting for a cinema-like experience), I can't help but admire the effort. Seeing as I will probably play it without hesitation whenever I manage to find others willing to play, I think I can justify keeping the rating at 9.

Android is a game that spawned the cyberpunk universe for FFG.  It unfortunately was not well received by the gaming community, but I think it is brilliant.  Lots of interesting mechanics all blend into this highly thematic cyberpunk noir game that I think deserves more credit than it has received.  I would have loved to see some expansions with new cases and investigators.  Maybe someday FFG will revisit this very cool game.

Probably the most fascinating and clever game I played. If only it was shorter... There are three ways to obtain points, determining the final winner:
1) A murder has happened: every character is a detective, competing to solve the case (although mechanically you are seemly more framing the murderer than finding him): during the game you pick up clues valued from -3 to 5 and add them to one suspect. In the end, the most guilty is THE murderer and you gain points if it was your "guilty hunch". Viceversa, you gain (less) points if your "innocent hunch" is NOT the murderer
2) A conspiracy is going on. You "uncover" it (mechanically you connect pieces of a jigsaw puzzle connecting different corporations with the crime) and gain points directly and indirectly (connected corps give some tokens of yours additional value).
3) Your personal story enters into game, with bad and good events determined by cards and other factors. There are checkpoints every 3 turns in which you count the "baggage" and follow the story towards greatness or failure.

Around this, nice and flavourful mechanics (like the cars represented by a measurer) and a system of good (for you) and bad cards (for opponents) which prevents you from "turtling" and ignoring other players.

Indeed a piece of art.
Rarely played (takes easily >4 hours), but I will never trade it away (unless a new version comes out, that's it)

Seems like too much down time in a 5-player game.  I think the game could have been more enjoyable without the conspiracy aspect - just focusing on the murder and your character's story line.

This game drips theme and is generally a good game, lots of ways to win, variable player powers.
Needs a bit of an "investment" until you completely get it.

From 2 to 5 players.

I'm in love with the idea of this game. Components are beautiful, and the rule book was good as well. A nice read.

But... honestly... can anyone tell me how to explain this to someone who has never played it in less than one hour? And why is it so impossible to have a decent strategy on how to win? And why does it feel like the conspiracy puzzle doesn't really matter all that much in the end? And why, oh why, for the love of god tell me why does it have to take 5+ hours to play?

Nope. I sold my copy. Not regretting it yet.

It feels like an unfinished game in need of some cutting. You get the feeling that Wilson was allowed to run wild, with the result being a game where every cool little idea is retained. There are some brilliant aspects, but ultimately the game requires you to digest a lot of rules, a lot of plot, and keep track of some confusing elements. This means a player can easily feel overwhelmed, or simply unengaged. I wish I could rate it higher.

It is like most Wilson games, in that the theme is ever present, but the mechanics feel off. At least here they are inspired.

So, yeah, it's an epic game that probably won't hit the table much around here, just because of time. And yet, when it does hit the table, you can guarantee that I'll want to be playing. This game hovers in between my "boardgaming" space and my "roleplaying" space in a really pleasant way. Plus, I'm a fan of Bladerunner, detective noir, and cyberpunk, so I'm constitutionally required to like this game.

And I do. I really, really do. Weird, huh?

Only one play, so far.  Not sure I want to try again.  After 2.5 hrs we just quit, so we could play something else with our time.  Despite winning handily, and understanding the game pretty well, I just didn't get in to it.  Of the four of us playing, no one really seemed to be having what I'd read as "fun" regarding body language, anyway.  On the other hand, some guys at the next table were hooting and hollering over the suspense and fun at their (different) game (which I'd have rather played).

Great background and theme, but a mish-mash of mechanics that just end up being a mess.

Game time is a week too long.  Very disappointed in this game.

Before I got this game I was a bit skeptical because of all mixed reviews it got but once I played it I loved it. 

Rules are really straightforward and although it has the thickest rulebook I have ever seen once you read them you hardly ever have to go back to it. Everyone from my gaming group understood the game right away and things made sence to all.

Lots of diversity in the game, lots of different strategies and for once characters in this game are different one from another, really different not just some occasional different ability.

I believe FFG abandoned it, not sure though, so I don't expect any expansions for it witch is sad really because with only 5 characters I can see it maxing out on number of plays that will hold it's appeal.

RATING: 5
Interesting at first, but once you have played each character (5 games), you have seen everything that can happen and the game is just too long and too random after that.

The balance between the various twilight cards is very poor, and you really need to read a ton of cards in advance of the game to avoid game-losing mistakes.

RATING: 5
I've only played once so far, and that was with 5 players -- a BIG mistake.  While I admire the creativity and originality, I found the game to be:
 
1) WAY too long.  We played with 5 players -- 3 new to the game -- and it took us right at 6 hours to play.  Yes, we talked and joked, but we do that in every game we play.  I would NOT play the game again with 5 players.  
 
2) There is WAY too much going on -- it is confusing.  This is coming from a guy who grew-up in the hobby playing complex war games that often had rule books 60 or more pages long.  I'm familiar with complex rules.  This one was just plain confusing.  In an admirable effort to develop a game that really evokes the complex theme, the folks at Fantasy Flight have given us a game that is on the edge of being too complex and confusing.  Indeed, for me, it may have jumped off that edge.
 
3) Story.  I also used to be a role-player, so I love immersing myself in a good story.  I never felt I was actually living the story.  We all did our best by reading aloud all of the backgrounds, plots and flavor text.  For me, it just didn't work.  The game failed to bring the story to life for me.  While some rave about the mechanism of placing evidence on the suspects in order to determine the ultimate perpetrator, I found this aspect to be weak and quite random.  This is NOT a detective game.  Rather, as one of my fellow East Tennessee Gamers put it, players assume the role of producers trying to lead their script to the best conclusion.  
 
There is no denying that the game has some very creative elements and innovations.  I really liked the puzzle-like conspiracy aspect.  Sadly, with five players, this played out before we were finished with the first half of the game.  With less players it would likely last longer, which would be better.  We also depleted the evidence tokens with several turns remaining in the game, greatly restricting our options over the final few turns of the game.
 
There is much to like here, especially for fans of American-style games.  For me, it was a matter of theme over substance, and it just took WAY too long and was WAY too confusing.  The confusing aspect would likely diminish with multiple playings, but it is not a game that I would play often due to its length.  Yes, the old argument of the playing time being reduced with subesequent playings could apply, but that assumes the game will be played with all experienced players in each playing.  That rarely happens in our group, as we always have folks new to a game involved in just about every playing.  Thus, I don't see the time to play being reduced substantially.
 
Will I play again?  Maybe -- but only with 3 or 4 players.  I will NOT devote a full day to this game -- it isn't that good.

Wow, talk about a convoluted table!

Its a remarkably interesting game, with a very cool resource assignation maechanic, however the agents different playstyles and the enormous amount of tokens, make it a bit confusing.

Not for the fainted heart... This is a niche game.

Need to approach this game with the proper mindset, which is IMO: "Let's hang out in this noir universe and explore the poor destinies of some broken guys against overhelming forces".

Have fun, take your time, expriment and relax and you'll be rewarded. Avoid this game if you are looking for elegant mechanisms and optimization play. It will be too dry for your taste. It's all about the universe, not about the winner.

3 players is the sweet spot. 6 hours for a first game. 3-4 hours for the following.

Incredibly thematic game with characters, plot and setting that is very engrossing. So why isn't this game a huge winner? The mechanics and flow of the game just don't work very well. There is a huge set-up time, and despite it's strong theme, the mechanics drag and gameplay just doesn't feel as epic as one would expect. There are some great ideas here, but it could have done with a lot of tightening and streamlining.

How can a game that looks so great play so lifeless?  I didn't like the frame-the-guilty system.  Seemed completely backward from how it should work.  You could have had a really immersive clue/deduction system but instead we find ourselves placing numbered tiles in boxes to be counted up later.  The conspiracy puzzle was a total abstraction that can result in some strong combos.  I really liked the plot system and thought it was well done.  The movement and resource management actions wewre pretty cool but I think the game could have been made with about 1/3 of the tokens they included.  Its also pretty long and repetitive as you run around doing basically the same thing every turn, then the game climaxes with a massive VP counting session.

Dear God. This game suffers from a serious case of "bit inflation." It's like the designer couldn't bear to eliminate any bit of chrome, and the publishers felt the need to create enough tokens to use up some vast underground hoard of cardboard. Entire forrests must have been wiped out for this. There are good mechanics in here, but they're buried under too much fiddly detail (warrants, hits, excessive victory point mechanisms, maybe even the conspiracy angle). There is so much to learn that just explaining the rules will take up most of an afternoon, and then so much to do that gameplay could keep you going through nuclear winter. I'm willing to play it some more because I like the theme and some of the mechanics are very good indeed (like the plots, which on first reading the rules I thought were completely extraneous to the game) and the cool movement and evidence systems. But finally, why is it named "Android?" It has nothing to do with androids...

A thematic adventure game of murder and conspiracy set in a dystopian universe. What more to ask?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very complex (probably needs at least a couple of plays to work everything out), but lovely and dystopian and twisted.

Really nice art and insanely detailed world; I could spend hours just reading the cards and absorbing the storylines.

It has a ridiculous number of tokens and cards and components. (I think if it'd been my offspring I'd have culled one or two layers of complexity.) There's so much going on that it relies heavily on honesty and remembering to do all the stuff you're allowed/supposed to do.

I finally got a chance to play this over the weekend.  I really enjoyed it.  It is a very long game (especially since we had a full compliment of 5 players), but, the first 90 minutes were taken up by rules explanation (we still missed a few, but it ironed itself out ok during the game) and there were also meal and toilet/cigarette breaks.  You HAVE to play this with a group that will read, and enjoy, the flavor text.  Definitely a unique game and not like anything else out there (that I have played, anyway).  The last day/round got brutal as everyone began dumping all the bad cards they could on everyone else.  I wound up losing, but, had I placed a piece of evidence differently on the 3rd day/turn, I would have changed the guilty suspect and won...  However, I was the only player (as I recall) with a Happy Ending... and yes, my group made ALL the expected "happy ending" jokes throughout the game.  I was very impressed with Android overall.

Provisional rating based on one truncated play. I enjoyed it a lot, but five players provide too much downtime, and too long a game for a Wednesday night. As a co-player said, "This game is supposed to simulate two weeks, not actually take two weeks to play."

A very intriguing game that certainly shoots for the stars (or the moon, in any case) and almost delivers.

Dripping with theme and storytelling ideas so neat that it keeps you engaged during others' turns and it satisfies even if you don't win.

The major downside is just that you have to plan to play it since it takes so long, especially with learning all the rules and mechanics. If you've got a group that's willing to do that, it is worth the effort though.

This game could have been awesome.  But it took 4 hours.  This is way too long for a game like this.  There are a lot of really interesting things happening, but I think about 1 or 2 sub-systems needed to be cut out of the deal to make this game not suck.

Played only one time, will rate it after at least one more game

Played a second time but it was late and some of us got tired. 

Next time we start this earlier and don´t play with 5 Players, think its better with 3 or 4.

Update: Played this with 3 and no distractions.
I like it very much, but it is really long & complex, it´s hard to get something from alle the storys going on and i don´t think this will hit the table very often, but i won´t turn down a match if i´m not to tired.

So let me start by saying that the folks giving it a low rating because it is complex and not like Net Runner need to research games before they buy them. 

Android is a masterpiece in every shape and form. From the quality of the box and art to the component quality. There is a ton of game in this box.  

The story flavor is immersive and does not let down in my opinion. This game is unconventional in a lot of ways.  From the beginning you are pinning a murder on a suspect, as well as the other player's so you may be going after a different suspect than everyone else. 

The balancing act of pinning the murder and trying to keep you're character in in good standing in their personal life is unusual and semi finicky but is what makes the game in my opinion. 

So if you are a fan Of Kevin Wilson's games, and like detailed games bordering an RPG with the incredible Android backdrop please do not hesitate to try this game. I do agree that the game is very complex and will not be for everyone, for someone like me who enjoys Arkham horror over Eldritch Horror or Descent 1st edition over 2nd edition Android does not disappoint in the slightest.

So much about this could have been good. The stories are great, as is the idea of having multiple paths they can take, and there are some innovative elements such as the method of travel and the light/dark cards linked to the twilight track. Unfortunately it all comes together to form a stinker of a game that plays like a long, boring, repetitive area majority Euro with too many over the top take that elements. Best to just read the cards and forget the game.

There are some cute ideas in this game, e.g. the way movement works keeps the feel of tabletop ruler movement, but doesn't suffer from the arguments over whether something is just too far or not. However, the game is too fiddly-detail for me. You have to keep track of of little details in other players play areas, e..g. which plot they are following, whether their NPCs are alive, etc, which means if you were to try to play properly the game would grind to a halt. Also, the way evidence works seems very random. And there are some other irritations, e.g. in many places favours (red, green, yellow or blue tokens) are referred to only by name ("political", "street", etc), not by colour.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Based on one play: the theme is great, the story is great, the production value is great.

But the game? Players draw and play cards to hurt other players like robots. There is no tactical/strategic choice in that mechanic. The evidence/hunch mechanic is interesting, but to have a game of 4 hours duration lost by half the points of your opponent is disturbing. If the mechanics / rules etc. would not have blended over the theme, it would have been a great experience. But in the end it just felt like too many random things were happening to me and I was not able to control the game.

I think I should try it at least once again. Maybe the second time the rules/mechanics would dissappear and I would be able to concentrate on the theme and immerse myself into the experience.

A "detective movie generator" game that takes place in the same universe as Android Netrunner. I was initially attracted to its game for its focus on theme and storytelling within the ANR universe. 

I have yet to play a full game of it as it is a long slog with a thick rulebook, but I think it has potential. My impression is that the game would be at its peak when you play with experienced players who enjoy the storytelling aspect of it.

I am looking for a story telling game to play with friends and alone... I hope Android meets my expectations (even if doesn't play solo!)

Edit after 1 solo play: AWSOME!!! I finally found what I was looking for: a good story telling game that actually involved me. I will try to make my wife friends and family memebers play this with me, but, even if I won't succeed, I will still play this alone. It's not the winning that is important, but seeing how the story develops. Will this burn the game for me, on the long run? probably, but, I'll deal with this when I'll get there.


Edit: Nov.18th 2014: I play it solo, with my simple solo variant you can read here: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1266985/simple-easy-solo-variant-wip

If you're looking for Clue, go buy clue.  This is NOT a deductive game, and it's suffered from the misperception that it's trying to be.

Maybe TOO many interesting choices, which is my one complaint, you never seem to get everything that you want to get done, done...

cferejohn, 1/21/2011: "Thematic games are at their best when the mechanics start to fall away. In a game like arabian nights, that happens almost immediately. In, say, Battlestar Galactica, it can take a little more time. In this game, it probably takes longer still. That isn't to say it isn't worth it to get there..."

The Good
- great components
- very good theme...sucked me in a bit

The Bad
- very long
- highly complex
- extreme "take-that" mechanic 
- unbalanced plots, some of which are just terrible
- steamrolling scoring on the puzzle board
- not a murder mystery, more like "make my plot be true" 

The theme is fantastic, but the cons drag this down.  Probably would never get played again due to the extreme length along with extreme complexity making it such that inviting new people to play who have never played might really turn the 4 hour game into 6.

RATING: 9.8
Absolutely love this game. It's more like a noir film or hardboiled novel (with cyberpunk trappings) than it is a cyberpunk detective game. It focuses more on the five characters, their stories and world building than it does detective work (which, if you're at all familiar with film noir, isn't surprising). The mechanics mesh well, especially considering there are essentially several interlocking minigames that form the whole. 

It takes a really long time to set up and play, and is very confrontational in some ways, so that can turn some people off. And lots of folks don't like it because it's not a true deduction game, per se (again, it's based on film noir...where finding out who the identity of the killer is usually the last priority). I think it's an insanely rich, incredibly rewarding game.

I really have trouble getting my mind set on what I should rate this game. On one hand, it's got truly innovative gameplay and awesome presentation and bits, but... it's kind of "too" heavy and cutthroat. And while the theme is really fun (and what mainly dragged me in), it's not really well integrated in the gameplay. I have waited a long time and play quite a few games before rating this, but I feel I'm never gonna be sure what I should give it... Let's say a 7 for now.

I adored this one! What a bear to get to the table though! Very heavy rules and a long play time make this one for fans only. You'll hear a lot of complaints about the detectives not really solving the mystery so much as framing the characters, but I'm cool with it. It's a reverse deduction similar to something like Tobago. 

It's also a very mean game. Players gain power by directly screwing over other players. I got shut down hard for about an hour of the game by a card. I learned to be prepared for next time, and the story that we weaved while I was trying to get out of my predicament was excellent! 

I suggest fans of this kind of dystopian scifi give it a shot for sure!

Initial Rating: 5.0 (July 2016)

I was a bit troubled about playing Android with 5 players, but I relented. I knew, in all probability, that the game (being a FGG game) would have lots of downtime and I was right. The downtime is WAY TOO MUCH and that decreased the fun of the game a lot!

Android is a thematic game and the first one in the Android Universe (obviously :P). I love the theme and, as I love Android: Netrunner, I liked very much to see the thematic tie ins between both games. I really like the dystopian future in which megacorporations control the world. In Android, there is a murder you need to solve and you play as a detective who tries to solve. It drips theme everywhere, the flavor text is excellent.

The game comes with full bio for the characters adding to the theme setting (I love that) but also comes with lots of tips on how to play them, I somewhat dislike this because I play boardgames to discover the strategies for myself. For example, in my detective sheet (Rachel Beckman) says that I never should have less than 3 cards and at the end of a turn to avoid attacks. At the end of the game other players told me they never attacked me because they couldn’t as I always had more than 3 cards. I never had the opportunity to discover this by myself and that bothers me. It also said Rachel Beckman should never focus on her suspects and on the conspiracy (but my suspect was the guilty one at the end :D). In general I dislike when the rulebooks or the aids say how you should play the game. 

Explaining the game rules isn’t easy. The rules aren’t complex, but there are many of them. You can explain them under 30 minutes. Playtime is around 4 hours (or more), the 180 minutes advertised by the publisher is a gross underestimation. 

We played Android with 5 players and the downtime was excessive, sometimes it went for more than 15 minutes between turns, very boring. Some of the “take that” cards can reduce the amount of time you get each turn or even make you skip your whole turn, those card should be banned from the game as they aren’t fun in any way (although thy are certainly thematic). In our game, that situation happened to one player and he got asleep between turn because so much time passed until he got his turn back. The downtime is HUGE negative for me and the worst sin a boardgame can commit IMO. Due to this, I think Android is best with 3 players. I refuse to play it again with more players.

The game´s components are very good as is usual from FFG. The board´s art is great as is the art on the cards. I particularly liked the cool looking “car ruler” you use to move in the world. The conspiracy puzzle is also very well done!

In your turn, you get an allowance of time that you spend in various actions. The game decisions are very interesting (where to move, which kind of clue to follow, what suspect to covertly frame/vindicate, should I advance the conspiracy? Do I try to achieve my personal goal? Which kind of card to draw and from what player?, should I try to use an space action? What player should I attack and with which card? How to manage the light/dual aspect of the game? Which card to play?) and non-obvious.

The suspect system is great and it can give a lot of VPs at the end. While you play you can bluff, deduce who the suspects of you opponents are and manipulate them into helping you. I love this part of the game. Less great is the uncontrollable luck inherent in the evidence tokens. A player can take 4 pieces of evidence and still be overwhelmed by ONE piece of evidence from another detective, besides each suspect has a different ratio for different pieces of evidence, that is, the evidences are more or less valuable if you play them in different suspects. Once you are pretty sure who are the suspects of your opponents you can plot to kill them :devil:, I like that part as well. The best strategy here is to never allow anyone to know who are your suspects and that’s easier said than done, but it is possible. This is the best part of the game for me, I like maneuvering evidence to make my guys or the opponent’s more guilty/innocent as needed.

Android has a huge replayability factor as is also usual from FFG. Each game plays very different because you use a different scenario, each detective plays very differently and the personal goals are also different and appear in different order. The guilty/innocent suspects are also randomly dealt

There is a lot of uncontrollable luck with the game, the light/dark cards, the consequences of the attacks (you choose blindly many times), the evidence tokens, the random events (in my game an event happened very near where I was so I was the only player to get VPS from that location). Perhaps luck can be decreased if you know more about the cards, but I won’t play enough times to reach that threshold. All of this is a negative for me as the game takes a long time to play. You ability to plan ahead is very limited.

Bottom line, Android is an unique game with an epic feel to it. I would have loved it when I was a newbie in the hobby, but now, I have drifted away from most thematic games (I prefer superior gameplay and mechanisms even if they don´t make thematic sense). It has a VERY HIGH downtime and that’s the worst affliction a boardgame can have in my book. I also have drifted away from “take that“ games and the attack cards can be devastating in Android, furthermore if they take time from you as I previously wrote. I’m open to try it again with 3 players, but I’m selling my copy of the game ASAP. Desire to play it again is low. Android reminds me a bit of Arkham Horror (which I love, although I confess that’s due to nostalgia as it was one of the first boardgames I bought).

Having just played my first game (with 2 players / 4 suspects) I think this is a game that, although it won't get played often, I'll always enjoy playing. It was a hard slog to get in to - set up and rules reading took a very long time, but by the end of the first week (of the game - not actual time!!) we had a good handle on the turns, options and a little strategy. I'm looking forward to playing with more players as it kind of felt a little empty with just the two of us, and the ability to play cards was limited. Reading some reviews, the "take that" aspect of a lot of the cards is something that I thought would get to me, but as they are so thematic I didn't mind. It's the kind of game, like Arkham Horror, that is interesting whether you win or lose because the story is so full. I'm looking forward to getting to know the characters, developing some strategies and finding out more about this world.

Ambitious, sprawling, engrossing experience in a box. It takes a certain type of player willing to accept a pretty non-standard game to make it work, and I'm not sure that the people who spend their time in the BGG forums bleating about how this title didn't meet their expectations were ever really predisposed to accept or enjoy what this game actually is. 

I've now played it as a 2P game, and I think it works just fine. It's obviously even easier to work out someone's guilty hunch than it is in the 3P game, but the way evidence gets discarded from the Strong and Weak files when the case is closed, we still had a couple surprises--enough of a swing took place to prevent my opponent from getting both hunches to pay off on the suspect he was obsessed with. The 8 VP he wasn't able to cash in because of that handed me the unexpected victory as Raymond, who had dominated the conspiracy to turn Street favors into 3 VP each (I finished with 4 of them). 

Awesome game, and it looks like my friend enjoyed it and wants to try again.

Took a while for me to wrap my mind around the game.  It has more free flow than I thought.  Definitely have to have a Arkaham Horror mind set for rules as you dig into this but the rewards of a great game lurk inside!

Android is a tough game to teach to new players.  Tons of rules and things to keep track off...can give a person a headache.  I like the theme of the game and like the general idea, but I would not play this with people who have AP or who don't "love" the theme.  Takes more than three hours with five people.  I love playing long games but then again there are people whose attention span is gone after one so choose your opponents wisely.

I love this game.  It is like no other board game out there today.  It is a "Story-driven" game & is not bogging players down in any "dice chucking" mechanics--with everything based on luck.  There's not just a murder mystery to solve but a conspiracy to reveal & an emphasis on managing your character's storyline within the game.  So much value is placed on whether your character ends their personal story at endgame on the upbeat otherwise it costs you in victory points.  I recommend this game to die-hard board gamers who are looking for something very different in their boardgaming experience.  It is a long & involved game so if you're looking for something "light", avoid this game.  You won't find it here.

RATING: 6
Such a strange, fascinating beast. Too long, too complicated and too fiddly. And I have to twist myself into pretzels to make the theme work without it feeling like I'm framing people. But...the theme. And the setting. That universe and those characters. I love them and if I can find a variant that allows me to get away from the thematic disconnect of "planting" evidence then this would probably rocket to a 9 or 10.

There are few games as polarizing as Android. After one play I can't tell which side I'm leaning to. I enjoyed it although I can see why people dislike it. 
We played with four and it took us more than five hours. It can happen that you have to wait 10 minutes until it's your turn again. There's an enourmous upfront investment in learning the game and its many subsystems. Much time is spent on managing the complexity of the game and decisions with doubtful relevance for the final outcome as luck of the draw and (in-)attentiveness of other players in (not) targetting somebody will have at least as much influence. Android clearly lives from the thematic experience.
For me, it's the competitive alternative to Arkham Horror. There's a potential that the take-that component tanks it. If the final determination of the murderer is as decisive and difficult to control as it seems it might reduce my enjoyment of the game.

RATING: 7
Este juego es difícil de describir. Incorpora un montón de mecánicas novedosas. Y el tema está bien incorporado al juego. Las historias personales y las cartas de luz/oscuridad hacen que haya bastante interacción entre los jugadores y crean la impresión de estar viviendo una historia.

UPDATE: Como otros juegos de FFG, Android es mucho más sencillo de lo que las reglas dan a entender. Tras un par de partidas todo encaja y se hace muy fácil jugar. Quizás por esa curva de aprendizaje está tan infravalorado.

FUNDAS: No enfundado. El tamaño de las cartas grandes es el estándar de FFG (como las del Starcraft). Según Mayday hacen falta fundas Chimera, pero las Mayday Eurogame y las TGB Size 4 ajustan muy bien (no perfectas).

RATING: 1
Some very creative and thought-provoking mechanics, but the resulting game play is excessively long, outcomes are disconnected from the player decisions, and horrendously luck-based. Any sense of balance -- or even independent play-testing in several areas -- is missing. It succeeds magnificently at theme and flavor, but sacrifices any concept of a playable game in the process.

RATING: 9
A truly immersive gaming experience. This game has a great theme and some very interesting mechanics. A very good cross between a Euro and a narrative boardgame (in something that looks like pure Ameritrash). However, the game is kind of long for what it is and my fiancée finds the game too complicated, so it is unlikely to hit the game table very often.

Probably the best game i've never played! Even so, I've rated this game because i'm so impressed with the rules. This is controversial (particularly since some reviewers get a barrage of abuse if they choose to write a review about a game even after just a single play) but i've told you where i'm coming from. The number of aspects to the game and the way they mesh is commendable - something for everyone, but probably everything for only a few? I'll revise my rating when i've played but if you want to comment...

Finally played it and it lived up to my expectations, still a 9.0. So much stuff and so many choices in what isn't an overly complicated game but takes a while to set up. Flavour text is excellent but so abundant that most of it didn't get read out. Maybe next time......

Fantastic game. I can't think of anything to compare it to. So many different facets. You play an investigator with a past and you have to travel across the city to collect clue tokens with which you moreorless frame a person that you want to be respnsible for a murder. It is not a deduction game. Along the way you can play card to benefit yourself and cards that can hinder your opponents. And to top it all off, each investigator has a personal plot that unfolds over the course of the game. Lots going on and lots of ways to win. Love it. Only a 7.5 because it can take a long time and explaining the rules to new players can bog you down.

This came out at a time where I was consolidating, rather than expanding, my collection, and I really didn´t need another big FFG game sitting on my shelf, waiting to be played...
I´ve "caught up" a bit since then, so when I found this cheap at an online shop that was doing a bit of spring cleaning, I bought it...
 Received the same day I got Mansions of Madness...

Not played yet, but usual nice FFG production, that I look forward to!

I really enjoy the scifi theme and the noir story that winds its way thru this game.  Think murder mystery set in the Blade Runner universe.   The mechanics are all over the place and detract slightly from enjoying the story, but it seems to be true to what a movie would be.  These are broken people trying to get ahead by framing someone for murder.  They don't really care who they take down.  Bad things are going to happen.  Bet on it.

This game is very long, with some important player dowtime, which is a major flaw for me. The principal systems, while fun, are not that visionnary and in fact, above the surface of a blade runner like adventure, you really have a bid system for the criminal, a jigsaw puzzle for the conspiration and other such simple systems, nothing ot be crazy about. I think that I will play once more time with less than 5 peoples to see if it finally clicks for me.

Edi: I played the game two more time and obviously, it didn't click for me...

Amazing storytelling game with a lot of theme but you need the "right" players to really enjoy this gem. This game demands from you to actively interrupt the other players in order to keep them from winning. It is less about what can I do to win and more about how can I prevent the others from winning?

In some way a bit backwards to what most players are used to, but if you get into it, the game can be very rewarding and at the same time trying to tell a story is awesome.

Played this once at Gamestorm 2011.  The theme wasn't my favorite.  I didn't like the mechanics much (putting influence on suspects, traveling from one side of the board to the other was difficult).  The puzzle mechanic was interesting and unique.  I won the game but didn't enjoy the process of getting there.

This is the only game I've played so far in which every bit of flavour text was read out aloud. That's how great and strong the theme is! It manages to create an amazingly vivid and strong dystopian world. For me this game is a masterpiece and it's a shame that it never really got the recognition it deserves. Just don't go into this game expecting it to be a cyperbunk version fo clue. That's not what is is and not what it should be.

After one game of Android I'm conflicted. On the one hand, it's really cool that someone got to make a game like this by throwing a lot of thematic rules in a heap.

Played in bleached_lizard's heavily modified version. I'm sure it's a vast improvement over the original, but it's still a random game at heart, and there's no papering over some of the slack design here. Movement is absurd, for starters: some players have a disadvantage (worse calipers) with absolutely nothing to compensate. Why? Because. If movement used a point-to-point system, you'd know where you could and couldn't move to without having to measure with the calipers and tip your hand, but this like any sensible idea was swept away by the cuteness of the design. 

I don't know the original, but the version I played was also prone to wild swings - I was ahead for most of the game, and fell behind in the turn before my last due to a gambit by another player. There wasn't anything I could do to recover; he'd just saved up for taking out a hit on someone I needed to live just before the last turn. Ta-da! You lose! 

I guess in theory the clever thing to do would have been to spend some more time shoring up resources to counter the hit, but I don't see it - I'm not sure that my choices would have been radically different had I seen the hit coming. 

There's might be a decent game in here, buried deep, and judging by what I read by lifting bleached_lizard's fixed cards out of their slips, the original was indeed atrocious, with a strange mixture of completely useless and overpowered cards. I don't know if there's any salvaging it, though, and I don't think it's really worth trying.

I guess I'm one of those who can look beyond the (admittedly) flawed game mechanics and really get immersed in the theme. The fact that I'm a huge Blade Runner fan is a plus.

Really a quite enjoyable game.  Much like Arkham Horror, it involves a large investment of time and interest to both understand the game and play a round, but it's the kind of thing I find worthwhile.  In some ways, it offered a similar feel to Arkham Horror except in a competitive setting.  In some cases this puts the devastating events of AH into the hands of your opponents, but for the most part the gameplay feels satisfying, as if you're accomplishing something with your time.

I look forward to more plays!

A long game, but I love the experience and the story. I would consider a very unique game experience, and will only improve with repeated play - i think this is why this game got a somewhat bad reputation... i needs some time and loving... but then it will give back in spades.
Problem is, i cant find anyone who is willing to spend the time to learn the game and enjoy it like i do...

RATING: 3
So lovely to look at, yet it takes so excruciatingly long to play! Not worth the time at all...there is great potential for storytelling, and it seems like it can be quite immersive. I like the theme, and the realization that everyone is essentially framing targeted suspects fits with the whole corrupt, dystopian feel. There's a nice innovation in how players travel, but the gameplay itself is repetitive and dull. The plots for the characters are another nice touch, but feels like it plays second fiddle. I am not adverse to long games; but in Android you really do feel the 3+ hours, whereas in something like Battlestar Galactica in my group, that same amount of time (for us, more like 2.5 hours or less nowadays) just flies by.

In many ways the quintessential Fantasy Flight game: great theme, ambitious ideas, but hobbled execution with some basic design flaws that should have been spotted during even a single playtest.

I like the puzzle aspect, although I would prefer if it let you alter other players' incentives more strongly. I also really like the cardplay, which is where the real meat of the game is. A lot of the cards bring out the characters strengths and weaknesses very effectively, and you need to know a character's deck to play them well. I'm not sure yet whether I want to invest the time to get to that stage, because the presence of the basic flaws mentioned above suggests the game could fall apart on detailed inspection. The cardplay is the only area where the theme really clicks though: sadly, I doesn't feel like I'm solving a murder or conspiracy, but very obviously placing chits on a board. The player really has to do the work to make the theme and mechanics connect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Comments based on one reading of the rules and a short run-through of the mechanics.  It's hard to know how to feel about this game so far.  It is clearly richly themed and quite innovative but the game play felt a bit dry.  Hopefully, more plays will alleviate this concern,
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
I absolutely refuse to play this one again.  It's one of the worst four hours of gaming I've ever had.  Yes it started with the owner of the game not really remembering how to play.  But then how can you with a game that has so many rules and is obviously not going to get played but once or twice a year?  Add to that the fact that of the few rules I could understand or remember I just chose to basically do the same action over and over again and I WON!  Now I well understand there is probably something the other 4 players were suppose to have done to stop me but that was anything but obvious.  Strictly speaking the game probably needed even MORE explanation than all the rules to include some strategy.  It just isn't a game that is ever going to work in a pickup group at a game night or similar.  Therefore I'd only suggest it if you have a regular group that is willing to be committed.  Likely a group well into the Android Universe theme as well.  I guarantee if I purchased this game I could do a better job at prepping and teaching it but given it ranks as my worst gaming experience out of literally tens of thousands that's just never going to happen.  If I long for an Android experience in the future I'll just play Android Netrunner instead which is plenty thematic for me.

This game is a masterpiece. Not for everyone endeed.
In the beginning players fells like they are playing a just a pick up & delivery game but when plots comes out and you learn how to use the twilight cards, the experience will flow.

It is heavy, slow, long play and you must keep track of all that stuff. But the theme and flavor are truly Blade Runner.

Another important thing; keep in mind that there is NO murderer! You MUST incriminate someone and innocent another person, like in a real case at all.

I am a bit conflicted.  I can't really say I played.  I like the idea and feel of the game, but my brain just kind of went blank and shut down like a quarter into the game.  When my brain was functioning right I really enjoyed the game.  When my brain died and shut off however, I just sat there either just moving or drawing 6 cards so I could finish my turns quicker.

I love Fantasy Flight games.  I think the rules were kinda somewhat glossed over on some points.  In a game like this that is so hard to deal with for me.

This would easily be my favorite game if I could find people willing to play it. I love the interlocking systems, the way the theme is so tightly integrated into play, the balance of gameplay mechanisms (the game is actually like a set of minigames, and the "game" is deciding which one to play when to yield the highest score). The universe is great and the flavor text is the best I've seen. The personal plots and twilight cards are genius, and I LOVE that there are NO DICE. It really feels like a bloated Euro made by a theme-loving American. My only complaint is the game length, which is not too bad once you know what you're doing, but by then, you've scared everyone off. I am working on a solitaire variant that I think has a surprising chance of working.

Edit: Now I have played it once online over the course of six months and this time I am certain that we got the rules right. My conclusion... this is not a good game. Score dropped from 3 to 2.

OK, I've played it three times, or rather 'tried to play it' three time. I really want to like it but I can't. Too many mechanics and I've figure out the one that breaks the camel's back: it's the conditional baggage. I can't see which conditional baggage is relevant to other player's plots as it is written in small print on their plot card on the other side of the table.


I've only played twice and I'm not ready to give a ranking yet.

Nice game in the cyberpunk-scifi-genre. Especially cool: You never know who will win the game until the last round. So you never get too frustrated like in other games when you are left behind - cause you don't know until the end. That's well done because everyone stays motivated till the end of the game. Well, beside this Android suffers a bit of the complex "dark-shift/light-shift"-mechanism, that makes it very complicated to play cards and stay "up-to-date" when to pay what costs and when to play a certain card on an opponent...

I *love* the flavor text, the characters, the atmosphere, the stories that emerge with every card played and every turn of the personal plot... Unfortunately, everything else is broken. The conspiracy and investigation elements seem totally arbitrary, the light/dark shifting mechanics enforce a "take-that" gameplay, which doesn't go very well in my gaming circle, the downtime is annoyingly high and the complexity too high for what it offers in return. I only hope that someday somebody will remake it into a good game. Until that happens, I give it an 8 for attempting to push the limits of storytelling in board gaming.

Given to me by a friend (thanks David!).  The thing feels broken, long and not very engaging despite the theme that's very close to my heart.  I need to look into the various promising home rules for this.  Transforming this into a real investigation (i.e. there is an actual, objective truth to discover) seems like a desirable shift.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I only read the rules so I cannot put a number on it.

I the worst thing about this game is that there is no investigation at all. You try to bid on the character you want to make guilty or innocent which does not make any sense. In a investigation, you do not make people murderers, you try to find them. 

So that's the thing that bothered me the most. Else, the game seems OK. There is a lot of components, personally I would have tried to cut down in these components.

The twilight system is an interesting mechanic but thematically it makes no sense. You do not constantly shift from good to bad during the weak. You drift toward one side or the other.

As for clues that can be found during the investigation, the player to your right moves the token as if it was a trail. OK, it's simple to implement, but it's not really an investigation trail.

The plot cards story is not a bad idea. Still, I would have prefered a common deck of cards to make sure the story possibilities are almost infinite.

There is a lot to like here and it really is an ambitious game. It takes some time to understand all the relations and links in order to get a hold on strategies and lower the impact of luck. Sometimes the turns can feel a bit repetitive, and some mechanics do not match with the theme, which is a pity and the reason why I do not rate it any higher. However, it is REALLY rich in theme, which is why I do not rate it any lower.

The best way to describe Android is a brilliant game that has so much going on in it that if it was split up into 2 or 3 games they would probably all be 9s or 10s. I am a HUGE fan of storytelling games, and this game probably moved the bar on storytelling games further than any game has in many many years. Set in a suprisingly cool cyberpunk future world, and with a whole lot of thought put into the overall story arc, this game has theme in spades. Kevin Wilson is cearly the best designer working at FFG currently, if not in the world. The one problem the game has is that there is so much crammed into the game that it really is daunting to try and get into.

RATING: 7
Looks like a thematic Euro finally appeals to me.  Detective stories adding characters' inner struggles against a crime scene backdrop - who would be the typical American detective on the run? I hope this game offers a lot of decision points, whereas each and everyone could have profound impact in the strategic end.  If so, I would definitely want to buy this game.  But then, will there be enough interest from others who share the same vision about the world?

This is a game from 2008 that I avoided for a long time (which wasn't very hard -- it's not like I turned down any offers to play it) because I thought it was probably not for me. I've now played it and discovered how wrong my preconceptions of this game were. It's an experience unlike any other, and I'm dying to play it again.

Doesn't get to the table often due to the setup and play time.  This one is hard to get a handle on it.  It is different, and you have to have the time and patience to play it.  Don't try and play it if there are lots of distractions around.  Take the phone off the hook, send the kids to the grandparents, disconnect the doorbell and play it.  Immerse yourself into it.

i absolutely hated this game the first time i played it because i was lost for the entire game. there's a lot here, a lot to keep track of, but once the rules sink in, and once you are familiar with ALL the player characters, the game becomes easier to understand. i still don't like that if you don't know all about the other the player cards, you can get completely blindsided by another player's special ability when you don't know what it is...

I played this game once at a con.  It was incredible.  Very deep and rich in theme - took a while to play (5-handed, all newbs)  but after it was over I sat back with a sense of having accomplished something.  Having experienced something unique.

I may only ever get it to the table once a year, but I know that one time will be worth it.

A good game, but it does suffer a few flaws. Tries to do *everything* which is both good and bad.

RATING: 9
Solid 8. I'm not sure that the rating could ever go higher for several reasons including:

- This game can be played by 5 players, but I'm not sure I'd ever want to. Time is the major factor here that even though there are a fixed number of rounds, it's still quite long. 3-4 is a great number for this game, and it scales amazingly well.

- There's a ton of fiddle here. I love the system and the theme so I don't mind that much, but the setup is 10x more arduous than the breakdown.

- The learning curve for a game of this length is VERY steep. So steep that they had to have strategy primers in the box (which I'm quite thankful for). Still, it makes new players start at a distinct disadvantage; and given the amount of screwage that you can inflict that could certainly be a factor to discourage repeat plays by newcomers.

It's a great game with quite a number of ways to play, and then there are "mini-games" that have to be managed within each character.  Once we got the kinks out our 3rd play was smooth, fun, involving, challenging, tense, suspenseful, and satisfying.

One final note is that I was surprised at how balanced all the point strategies in the game are; meaning that there is a bonus as well as a foil for every point system in the game. The conspiracy puzzle can benefit early adopters and late comers equally as well.

Android seems like a tremendous game.  There so much going on, and so much thought and effort clearly went into the design.  Almost every mechanic which the game runs on it cool.  Unfortunately, there is so much to this game, which should be a problem, but so much of it is not entirely intuitive or apparent to players without player aids or note taking.

This game is certainly aimed right for my sweet spot. My all-time favorites are BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and Knizia's LORD OF THE RINGS. What I like about both is the brilliant way that they re-tell familiar but highly complex, suspenseful stories through an ingenious combination of text and artwork with game mechanics that are actually _built_ to represent idiosyncratic features of the original stories' plots. 

ANDROID is certainly from the same general family of games, but the all-important difference is that you don't actually know the story beforehand - you're learning it for the first time AS you play the game. And this simply doesn't work, unfortunately. Because one lacks any prior familiarity with the characters, and because the narrative is revealed in such a random, piecemeal fashion, nothing like a narrative structure is ever really discernible.

If it's a failure by these lofty standards, though, then it nonetheless certainly qualifies as a brilliant failure. The rules are enormously complex, but hold together much more intuitively than those of Kevin Wilson's more famous ARKHAM HORROR, and the player is faced with all sorts of interesting tactical choices from start to finish. The art is very good, the flavor text (while a bit cliched occasionally) is always literate and interesting, and the gameworld is a wonderfully original feat of imagination.

RATING: 6.9
Played one game of it.
The setting is alright, the art is ok (though uneven), the game itself is fun, but about two hours too long. The main problems are the extreme fiddliness of the whole thing, the time it takes to play out, and the abundance of stuff to do and to remember - BUT it's much easier than it actually seems on the outset.

Some very interesting mechanisms here, but ultimately it's the kind of game that begs the question - why is this a board game, instead of a video game or RPG? Requires a lot of focus and a lot of good will from the players.

That said, I actually look forward to playing this again.

EDIT 18.11.2012: after a second game, I'm optimistic. There's definitely a pretty good gaming experience here, despite a lot of fidliness and heaps upon heaps of unique rules for almost every card and effect in the game. The kind of game that will definitely be better once played several times with the same group. However, the time it takes is a bit punishing - 4+ hours seem to be the norm, while it should take 3 at maximum to be really enjoyable and keep your attention.

3/2012 Game feeling slightly reminicent of ArkhamHorror though there's an entirely different theme. It's not so much about finding the murderer, but rather framing the suspect that suits your game objective. In that process you've got to keep a keen eye on several aspects and balance your actions.  There's lots of interesting stuff going on as the game progreses and when it finaly ends it's like completing an eventful journey with your fellow and equally shady investigators.

4/2012 Been through a 5 player 7 hour (!) game. There's LOTS of downtime with added players.  This gives one time to evaluate, and, while there's lots of 'stuff' to do in the game, there's really not many viable actions that really has an effect on the game.  Rating down 8 -> 6.

First Impression after on Incomplete 5 player game.  Beware of the BGG recommendation to play this game with less than 5 players, it is right.  The problem with Android is the downtime, which is even worse with 5 players.  It is the typical FFG production, with all the good, the bad, and the ugly that we have come to expect.  The good is the fact that there is an interesting universe, with well defined characters and interesting storylines, good graphics, and overall a very "cinematic" experience that stays with you after the game.  The bad is the rules with all the mini-exceptions, some of the playing aids, some of the mechanics (like the fact that players have to keep track of other players actions/conditions that act as triggers -- for example, you might need to pay attention to when someone's hand has seven cards, etc, many things that can be missed, overlooked, hard to reach/read, slow down gameplay), some of the iconography.  The ugly is the high downtime.  I would like to try this again in three and see whether that helps reduce downtime and focus/streamline/improve some of the mechanics like the investigation.  Otherwise I feel that it has many good ideas (including some bluffing/deception and some interesting mechanics) that are drowned by the size of the game.

RATING: 8
Good and strange game concept, close to a rpg-puzzle as clasification, is about building a dramatic story and to assemble clues to get a guilty (meanwhile you try to uncover a high conspiration) I was amazed by the game that seems pretty complicated at the begining but with the playing get used and apply strategies to get your guilty and innocent. Is an innovative and different game from what i have played before.

RATING: 3
[Played once]
Too long, convoluted and opaque to give any satisfaction.
The mechanincs are a mix of old ones (e.g. investigating the crime is an area majority game, you get Action Points to spend during your turn, etc.) and innovative ones, some of which feel as if they are present just for the sake of innovation (e.g. movement). 
Too many fiddly details detracts from the experience, the story never comes alive, the sevral "take that" elements are just more or less blindly thrown around (since you do not know who is winning).
Repetitive, not really evocative and fiddly gameplay.

Long game this one.  Worth the investment though.  It's more a story telling game than a deduction game.

Components are the usual FFG standard and the mechanics typically Kevin Wilson.

Android is a board game of murder and conspiracy set in a dystopian future. Detectives travel between the city of New Angeles and moon colony Heinlein chasing down leads, calling in favors, and uncovering the sinister conspiracy beneath it all. The detectives must balance their pursuit of the murderer against their personal lives and their inner demons. Android’s innovative mechanics ensure that no two detectives play alike.

RATING: 9.1
Simply incredible gaming event. Highly thematic crime-drama that feels almost like blade runner. The game is part strategy, part roleplay, part opportunity and plenty of suspicion and player interaction both with the cards and the potential of roleplay. It does take some time to familiarize yourself with the game and to set up and manage everything, but it plays surprisingly smooth and also offers great replayability despite the limited story lines.
Much of the game's joy is the deep amount of story telling the game offers via the plot cards, the crime and the events. 
There is also a tremendous amount of srtategy in the game. Some folks criticize the game as having too many mini-games within the game, but these are simply thematic vehicles of additional VPs. everything in the game is toward victory points, so if you're spending all your time ensuring your character's plot unfolds possitively, that can be just as many points as determinig the guilty person.
Fans of deduction can enjoy this game as well as you can spend a good amount of time trying to figure out who the other players are trying to frame or prove innocent. 

The game is definitely not for everybody, but it can be one of the most rewarding gaming experiences for those who dive into it and emerse themselves in it.

So far I'm impressed. This is the kind of game that leaves you thinking about all that happened for long after the it's over. The theme is excellently implemented and it really manages to convey the sense of dread and tension you'd expect from the cyberpunk/dark near future genre.

Although the actual murder investigation is not about deducing who the murderer is (like in Clue), deduction is still required to guess what suspects other players want to be guilty, and this information really affects the outcome of the game.

RATING: 8
Great Game. Wonderful theme and art. Not as complex as it seems at 1st glance. Probably best with 3 and maybe a little long with 5. 

This should appeal to both At fans and Eurogamers. The mechanics are very euro. Move about a map and activate things so that you can move someplace else later and activate something else with what you got.  However all of this moving and button pushing is wrapped in a theme and a world that is developed to a point most eurogames can not approach. 

I do not understand why this game got such a cold reception. It is a great and innovative design and all game fans should take the time to try,

Excellent production value, some original ideas, complex gameplay that may hinder fan. Actually is a masked euro loaded with heavy theme. For me it works well, but it seems very chaotic, if played with 5 players. I have to try it with 3 players, which in that case I believe that it will be better, concerning less downtime and more control over the actions of other players.  

EDIT: I played 2 more games with 3 players and as I expected there is more control over the other players' actions. I like it very much and still the element of surprise works well.

Finding the right opportunity to try this is going to be tricky, what with a three-hour play time, learning the rules, and its fiddliness. I fully expect it to be frustrating for my entire group, myself included, and to outstay its welcome (though I'd love to be wrong). I'm optimistic that it will also be a unique experience that's wonderful in its own way.

If a perfect time to play this falls into my lap, I'll give it the business. For now, though, I don't want to play it and it's staying off my Want to Play list.

Played around 10 or 12 3P games so far.  This game is a beauty.  For people who prefer story, theme, and fun over optimization and cube pushing (nothing wrong with those).  Also, this is not Clue or Sleuth or anything like a deduction game.

I look forward to many years with this wonderful game.  It is one of those games that deserved an expansion and won't be getting one it appears.

This game is the poster child for why setting expectations without prior factual knowledge is a bad thing.

Still, after more games it is starting to lose some shine. The luck factor is a bit high for my tolerance and totally imbalanced games do occur.

I was kinda nervous going in with all the meh feedback I'd been hearing but I was quite pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed myself and really want to play again.

It's a pain to learn, but once you understand what's going on there seems to be a good wealth of possibilities for how you choose to progress. Perhaps after a lot of plays one might figure out "optimal" strategies, but 1. that will take quite a while and 2. so much is dependent on what other players are doing that I don't know how possible sticking to the plan would be all the time.

Great setting, fun story building style and a pretty lavish production push it over the top for me. I also love how movement is handled.

I could see myself liking this a lot more or a lot less once we get a good number more plays but for now I'm really excited about it.

With a better understanding of the game, I would have tried to interfere with other players there. I´d be happy to play again, but I´m not sure that will happpen.

Set in a Blade Runneresque cyber punk universe Android is a wonderfully imaginative journey that plays like a novel.

It is truly unique.  You're a detective working against the other player detectives to prove your guilty hunch.  If you're right your career takes a turn for the better in the form of victory points.  It is NOT a deduction game and an attempt to turn it into one called the "Director's Cut" is just a bastardization that wrecks it.

Your characters have plots....lives that get in the way of their detective work but which if unaddressed will cause them to fall apart costing you major game winning points. In the midst of it all is the conspiracy you work to uncover by playing puzzle pieces -- another unique mechanic.

Android requires patience to play and you need the right group, but there is no other game quite like it.  It's a work of art as much as it is a game.   You'll either love it, or hate it.  I love it.

Somewhere between a board game and an rpg experience maybe closer to a guided Choose Your Own Adventure that plays out as you "create a case" against your suspect. This is a unique game that deserves an in-depth play even if you are remotely curious. It sticks with you in a different way than other games, and even more so due to the way the setting-think Blade Runner-is handled in the mechanics and design.

And since this is the only game like this, I guess I'll have to continue rating it a 6 until I make a decision either way or suffer a traumatic brain injury.

I think I like the idea of this game better than I liked the experience of playing it the first time. But, as much as it made my head hurt, I'm keen to try it again so that I can play more competently.

First FFG game I've considered worth owning.  Very good atmosphere and a ton of new ideas and mechanisms that seem jumbled together but really work in the end.  Very interested to try again with new plots and characters.  Lots of stuff out on the table!

As with most things Fantasy Flight, the production value on this one is superb. The theme is well implemented and premise engages the players before the game is opened, but unfortunately that's where the compliments end. There are some excellent ideas in this game, they just need to be streamlined and tweaked to make them really work. One day someone will make a worthy dystopian fiction game that actually works.

This really fell flat and it will be a while until I'm willing to touch it again. Having to explain and, in a sense, defend rules did not make it better.

Kind of fun to spot the sci-fi influences and references.  Ok as a game.

Definitely representative of the type of game that FFG does very well... an experiential/adventure game that melds together aspects of RPGs with decent boardgame mechanics.  Whether you'll enjoy the narrative or not is key to the game's enjoyment. 

Thus, Android is not "balanced" or a true test of skill in a strategic/tactical sense, but I found this game fun to play... if you buy into the game's setting and world.  As a fan of Blade Runner, thought this game was well done.

This game is a work of a genius and a work of art at the same time! Even though it does not hit the table very often (players need to be rested and concentrated for a long time to be able to play it), it is a game which impresses and mesmerizes me! Also, component quality is Superb!
It is a very special game, so research well before you decide whether you want to buy it... If you like heavyweight games and SF theme though, it is probably going to blast your mind, as it has blasted mine :)

This game, you guys. THIS GAME. Sigh. So fiddly, so long, so...not what you would expect from a dystopian future noir game. Some clever ideas (I still love the puzzle bit, and the rulers for movement has legs in another game) but this one mostly is a hot mess of over-production.

A pretty unique game. The game has a great deal of not only theme but strategic depth. 

The characters are unique unlike other games where you play a character with special abilities but you can still basically play the same strategy long term. In that aspect the game is very similar to wargames or historical simulations where one faction plays very different from another.

Picked up in trade (for my copy of War on Terror which my playgroup refused to play anymore).

Weird and complex ruleset, but thematically, it doesn't get more appealing - I am a humongous PKD and Heinlein fan, not to mention an oldschool Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett fan.

First play was admittedly slow - just wrapping my head around the mechanics and how everything fits together and interacts, etc. But I was deeply, deeply impressed. This is the immersive storytelling game experience I have always hoped Arkham Horror would be.

To be explicitly clear - it's not really a game in the sense that everything else in my collection is a game. It's a story-management system. I feel completely and totally swallowed up in the setting, I found myself making sacrifices in victory points just because I wanted my character to be... happy, and the events and occurrences actually felt like the events and experiences of a great cyberpunk noir novel.

It's absolutely a work of genius.

-----

edit: 6/13/09 - second play confirms it: played as Floyd - second attempt at plot card "Evil At the Estates." I feel like I just spent the last four hours completely immersed in a rich story, that barely (and only barely) ended happily, and was really more of a commentary on the selfish, brutal, stupidity of humanity, and the likelihood androids will never be human (but for all that, will also never be selfish, brutal, or stupid, and in that sense they will always be both far more and far less than us.)

This isn't a game, it's a work of literature.

The ONLY thing keeping this being a 10 and replacing my favorite game is that the LONG play time, and complex ruleset means there is an extremely limited group of people I will be able to play this with, and it will seldom hit the table. That's ok. It means the times I do play it will be all the more precious.


===========

Some more musings on this game:

In all the debates of Euro vs. Ameritrash, the key difference of design that is most frequently overlooked is whether or not game mechanics are arbitrarily imposed, or thematically meaningful consequences of embedded narrative within game play. This is far more complex than merely saying that Euros have "pasted on themes." 

In my mind, most classic Euros impose arbitrary limitations on players. The limitations to be solved in Euro games are so abstracted that they ultimately amount to pitting the player against [i]the game,[/i] rather than in Ameritrash where players are pitted against [i]each other.[/i] My own proclivities are to be pitted against another player - I frankly could care less about being pitted against game mechanics. Which is why I also find it so damn weird that I like Android.

Why? Because, strangely enough, players ARE pitted against the game itself in Android (and I know many people consider Android to be a clandestine Euro.) HOWEVER: the limitations, rather than being arbitrary and mechanical, are so closely linked to thematic considerations, that each choice feels meaningful in a way that really only happens in theme-heavy Ameritrash. 

This, to me, is one of the reasons why Android is a flawed, but ultimately inspiring, work of literature or art. In literature, characters make decisions not because of the arbitrary machinations of an omnipotent narrator, but because they are so well developed that they cannot but act how they act when they encounter conflict and struggle. Good characters, in literature, make their own decisions. And THIS is what happens during a game of Android...

The game play is frustratingly, wonderfully HUMAN. 

Which itself explains why so many pasty-faced cube-fondlers dislike it.

=================
And this, Android evokes this:
Of all the games I've played, Android seems to come closest to the kind of writing I love. The characters are neither good guys nor bad guys, they struggle as much with themselves as they struggle with the world, and although interesting plot-driven elements exist, in the end, the resolution of the external conflict doesn't matter. Things transcend themselves, and we are left after counting up VP, sitting in the dim light of a dirty cafe in New Angeles, sipping greasy hot black coffee, flicking ash, the smoke twisting from the end of our cigarette like the souls of dead android hookers. We order bad toast, wet eggs, cold bacon, and leaning back look out the window into the dark sparkling city, we see the 'stalk spiraling upward into the sky, not as a triumph, but as a worm, some vast malevolent parasite that has already eaten out the heart of the earth and now, bursting upward, is reaching for the fruit of the moon. And you'd know in that moment, looking at the worm, looking at your reflection in the filty glass of the cafe window, looking at the robot waitress, looking at the headlines on the coffee stained newspaper, looking at everything and nothing, that the worm did it's job well. It's all hollow now. You can solve a case, but you can't save nobody.

Fun with the right crowd and in the right setting.  Expect this one will take a while - it should not the main course after a couple of appetizers - it should be the whole meal.  I played with 5 and I played with 3 - I prefer it greatly with 3 because downtime is much reduced.  You can do stuff on other players' turns, but not four other players.  Two others keeps you interested in what they're doing without dragging your own turns along too much.  Also, expect to get screwed in ways you don't expect unless you memorize all the cards - which is not really feasible.

The game has a lot of things going on at once, it has some very novel and interesting mechanics.  However, the length killed it for me particularly since my first game (half game actually) was with the full 5 players.  I can see some potential in this as a 3 player game.

RATING: 10
The best hybridization of a thematic game and a strategy game on the market.

The theme level is immersive - everything from artwork to board design to flavor text works to enmesh you in the Android world.  At the same time, there are numerous routes to victory, as befitting a quality strategy game.  However, none of those routes feels divorced from the overall theme, or tacked on for competitive balance purposes - they are all of the place, and of the time.  The closest description I can think of is the board game equivalent of an open-world, Western-style RPG (think Elder Scrolls).

The core victory path - investigators trying to solve a murder - seems to frustrate some players, because the game doesn't predetermine a villain (a la Clue).  I try to avoid this by describing the scenario as follows: this is a cinematic game.  You are following your character through a rich, immersive world, and deciding which paths to take.  It is a game about discovering, not uncovering.  (Alternately, you're a corrupt antihero who is bending the rules in order to get the suspect you know is guilty.  Your call.)

Are there flaws?  Absolutely.  Don't start the game unless you've got at least four hours to burn, and six or seven may be a safer bet.  The asymmetric player abilities aren't horrifically unbalanced, but some are definitely easier to wield than others.  At times, it just feels like there's *too much*, too many options and paths and possibilities for deviation to just pick a clear strategy and win.

In the end, though, for whatever its flaws, the game is a truly one-of-a-kind experience.  If you approach it with an open mind and a little imagination, it will be unbelievably satisfying.  Just don't forget to break for dinner.

Android tries to build a bridge between euro and AT games, or rather hides its euro-mechanics within a gorgeous, strongly thematic setting. A nice game with lots of options, plays well with three players (which is not such a common feature, as I see it), and I enjoy playing it from time to time, due to its uniqueness. On the other hand, the end scoring is slightly awkward, and the rules are rather lengthy and sometimes a little bit unclear. Other than that, it's a very solid cross-over between the two completely different gaming worlds.

Found this totally overwhelming on the first play. I had little idea of how to achieve what I had to do and got criticized for Analysis Paralysis, not something I'm generally prone to.

If you like Bladerunner, then THIS is your game.  Very few games are are aggressive and thematic as Android.  Don't let the complexity scare you away, yet this is not a game for the faint of heart or short of time . . . also, don't let the first play sway your decision--it really starts to click after 2-3 plays (as the mechanics start to blend into the game play and strategy).  I think someone said this is the most ambitious game they have played and I have to echo that comment.  Some much going on, yet dripping with theme (like almost no other game around)--but does it work (i.e., is it fun)?  That is where the debate begins.  Several say no, but I disagree.  This game is loads of fun.  Maybe not the first play, but get it back on the table soon thereafter and you will not be disappointed.

You need the right blend of players for this game, ensuring your made of the right stuff too. There really is no game like it, approach it with the correct mind set and it cannot be beaten. A really fun, absorbing and deep game under the right circumstances. It is what you make it. Drop all preconceptions and ignore all BGG negative prattle before playing it, you will be amazed from start to finish. This has been sunk by some very famous BGG'rs but that's a failing in them, not the game.

Such a sexy production but my first plays set some alarm bells ringing in relation to some of the mechanics and board locations.

Way too much going on here to judge on 1 play though. In the end I decided that this wouldn't see more than 2-3 plays a year due to the length and this game needs 2-3 plays a month for a few months to fully understand.

So off it went in a math trade. Sigh.

NEWS FLASH - I lamented about losing this game so much at BorderCon '09, that Rene, Martha and Baby Anna surprised me with a brand new copy on our '09 visit. Yay!

This is definitely a once or twice a year game for me, but it's always a very enjoyable experience when I play. I wish that they would come out with a new version to streamline the game down just a tad, but I still think this is one of the most unique designs out there. The only real niggling problem with this game is that you aren't really solving a murder so much as you're trying to prove different individuals to be innocent or guilty, and you aren't really given any thematic reasoning as to why. If you can accept that, this is one of the best narrative-driven board games out there.

My first (and only) play was with 5 players - I would not recommend you try this at home! The downtime is excruciating. Top that with annoying "take that" gameplay and you could literally sit for 30 minutes and do absolutely nothing. With fewer players this wouldn't be AS bad, but the repetitive gameplay was enough to be almost thankful that I didn't have to take my turn.

I just don't see the complexity that others find. Confusion... yes, but the gameplay is really rather mundane. The characters are so wildly different that you really need to follow a different path for each. What that means is that the game will play differently each time you have a different character, but in that single game you will do a few things over and over again because if you don't you will not play well. But if the other players think that you're winning and decide to hit you with a few whack-a-mole cards, your gameplan will be all for naught.

I hate to use this statement, but if you like this kind of game, you'll probably like this. It's nicely themed, has plenty of eye candy and takes the better part of a day to play. Please don't ask me to join you, however.

The only problem is that this game has tooooooo many components,too many rules,too many things to keep in mind during your turn,as well as your opponents.

Android is certainly a niche game within a niche genre.  You have to enjoy experience games first and foremost.  If you are looking for something more than the experience that the game offers via the story and plot developments then there is a very real risk that you will be disappointed.  Beyond that, the game is also a fairly big time-sink.  Even if the playtime gets down to 3 hours or less (which I think is reasonable with 3 experienced players) that can end up being a dealbreaker for a game that emphasizes an experience over control or balance.

Again, I liked the gestalt quite a bit.  The narrative element is substantial and there are some innovative parts to the game play that worked well for me.  I wasn't turned off by the chaos nor the heavy take-that element that the various card effects have, but I can easily see how that could go too far for others.  If I were to make one change it would be to alter some of the point values for the different elements of the game.  Three points for a Jinteki or Haas token seems inconsequential compared to the amount of effort necessary to earn them.  On the other hand, a 30 point swing for the guilty hunch is just colossal. 

In the end, Android is a game I'm happy to own, despite the fact that it may never hit my table again :)

I absolutely love this game for both the theme and mechanics. It's extremely original and you have to play it to the theme and you must be involved with your character's story.  Unfortunately I still haven't been able to actually play a full game of it.  Only gotten as far as one of the two weeks played.  It's a shame but you do get quite a bit of an experience even playing it partially. I really need to get a couple people together for the sole purpose of playing a full game.

I love this game, it captures the Bladerunner style theme so well. The only problem is it's a little overwhelming for a new player, and as such I've had trouble getting anyone else to give it a second go.

It's a grab bag of mechanics and could have been split into several games, the multiple paths to victory keep you on your toes which is nice, and you never know who is going to win until the very end.

There are games that the length is not a problem. I have sat down to many, MANY games of Battlestar Galactica knowing that I was in for a 3+ hour game. However, certain games just feel like they drag. This is one of those games.

The other problem with this game is there are WAY too many things going on at once. There are three options for scoring points: 1) Plots, 2) Hunches, 3) Conspiracy. Let me break down the problems here.

1) Plots: The plots can be exceptionally difficult or exceptionally easy, depending on the plot/character and card draws. That said, only a few of these are actually nasty to the point of unplayability.

2) Hunches: With the random draw of evidence, it's actually really, really hard to get your hunches to pay off unless you somehow manage to get every piece of evidence right next to you character.

3) Conspiracy: Probably the most reliable way to earn points/useful stuff. Unfortunately, points earned from here are available to EVERYONE.

These are just my issues from this game after 2 1/2 plays (don't ask). I do enjoy how the cards interact with the game and the excellent flavor, but these don't fix the game.

Look at Go.  Drop a rock.  There's two other minor rules and THAT'S IT.  Look at this board -- each and every location has at least two pieces of information on it BEFORE specials and chits are introduced.  Most of this information adds unnecessary complexity that actually draws away from the theme, which I assume is the opposite of the designer's intentions.  But after four hours of this white noise, I'm done.  Uncle.  (And the second pass, the one where I knew what I was getting into, was no better.)

That was four incredibly theme-rich, incredibly over-complex, not terribly fun hours that I won't be getting back.  The game tries to be several things at once -- blind-bidding auction game for criminals, Carcassonne tile-play for conspiracy, storytelling for character, and more "take that!" play than most Euro-players will enjoy.  These various elements arrive half-baked in a way that TI3's everything-and-kitchen-sink approach managed to overcome, and as a result the game's theme feels more like "Southland Tales" clusterfuck than the "Blade Runner" dystopian noir it so desperately wants to be.   

The "Southland Tales" parallel is apt, and HiveGod nails it: The game isn't broken, but the magic circle the game creates pops very easily, because the game tries at every opportunity to remind you how very clever it is.  It's an alienating experience, not an immersive one.  And when that's gone, Android loses whatever flavor it's supposed to have and simply becomes a generic Euro with a heavier than usual "take that!" element.  It was a noble experiment and I applaud the effort, but no.

MODIFIED 5/22/15: Wow.  The "Director's Cut" variants really clean up the issues I had with this game: mainly, the verdict system.  I won't play Android without them, and I won't play it with more than 3p.  But under those conditions Android rises from the ashes.

I really enjoy this game. The way that the theme, mechanics, and art design come together really sells me on it. It's hard to learn and hard to teach, but once you get it down it's a very unique gaming experience. Also, has more bits then just about any game I've ever played, including Twilight Imperium.

First of all, this game is LONG. So, do not even consider buying or trying it if you do not have at least 1 hour for rules explanation + 3 hours to play! Do not consider it if the players' knowledge of English is not good enough.

It is a typical setting game, where rules do not play a major role as in German games.
In order to appreciate it, you should take your time to read carefully the plots and the cards' text, otherwise it seems just a sequence of abstract events with poor rules.

The 5 characters are very well detailed with interesting backgrounds. Plots are good and they have a good interaction with cards. In order to be fully appreciated, it requires also a preparation before the game, exactly like a role-playing game. Each characters reflects a different way of playing the game, which becomes evident after a few games.

It is NOT a "murder game": your focus is gathering evidence and not discovering the murderer. Therefore, it seems more a detective game, or a "lawyer" game.

It has some problems with the rules:
- evidence from -5 to +5 make the game too random, and alibi are completely worthless
- being first is worse than being last, and there is nor way to become last
- some puzzle pieces are unbalanced, and it is never convenient to dig through the puzzle.

My initial playthrough of this game left me with the sense that it is much more complicated than it needs to be and the theme is somewhat obfuscated under a mess of often obtuse rules and mechanics. In other words, a lot of potential buried under layers of unnecessary complexity.

Needless to say, this game has been sold.

RATING: 5
I've only played one game of this so far and it was a 5 player game and I suspect that 5 players probably isn't the best number of people to play this with.  It's a big game with a lot of stuff.  During the game I played I had little idea what other people were doing and no idea how well they were doing.  It was enough work to figure out what I was supposed to be doing!  It also took a long time and there was lots of downtime.

The game would probably be better with fewer people and would certainly be better after getting more familiar with it.  There's a heck of a lot to the game and some nifty ideas in there. 

But my first game just wasn't .... fun.

RATING: N/A
This sounds so awesome, but I am afraid that such a story driven, card and text heavy game cannot really work for us when using the English version, especially with incomprehensive rules/rule book. Also, practically all reviews I have read so far indicate that the game has many serious problems, despite all the cool ideas and approaches. 

Will try this at any opportunity nevertheless!

Bulky gameplay for the sake of nothing, poorly interconnected areas of play that seem as though they were added on just to make it "different" rather than really enhancing play.

Really interesting theme, but the rules are convoluted. I haven't ever gotten through a whole game yet (so no review score) as nobody will play long enough with me to finish it. I still have a fascination with it though. Something about it speaks to me and I feel I just need to decipher what it is.

This is probably the brightest shining example of the FFG game that got way too bloated. And it did so even without an example! But boy, do I really enjoy it anyhow. No surprise, since I do like complex games, and the neo-noir theme is right up my alley. My big complaint about the game, however, is that there's a lot of story that the game is trying to tell, but I don't feel like players are given enough time to tell it all.

Man, this game deserves so much more love than it gets. I think it's super interesting, and try to get it to the table a couple times a year. Lots of moving parts, interesting emergent gameplay, beautiful to look at. It's not super interactive and I don't love that. It probably runs a little long for the payoff. It's NOT CLUE, which to my mind is a good thing but makes it very hard to sell the game to other people. 

Anyway. Deserves better than it gets.

To enjoy this, you really need to have the mechanics down pat and to know your card deck - firstly, so that the game moves fast enough and secondly, so that you can wallow in the theme via the copious flavour text on the cards. For 3+ hours. Which means you're likely to struggle a bit through your initial plays, and your liking of the game will reflect your tolerance for theme over downtime. You're working towards three different ways of scoring VPs, and your deck of cards will lean you one or the other. It's an action point game, and you've got 6 APs on each of the 12 turns to move around the board, draw and play cards, or pick up stuff off the board. Most turns you'll want to move around the board's locations to where the evidence chits are, where you can add +ve (guilty) or -ve (innocent) influence points onto a suspect. Each player is trying to get different suspects guilty and innocent for (secret) end-game VPs so that's the main source of competition. Or you could use those evidence chits to add pieces to the conspiracy puzzle, which is literally a jigsaw puzzle, with which you draw lines from the centre out to 8 different possible destinations, each of which change the way VPs score at end-game. How this unfolds affects what becomes more valuable to pick up from the board, and obviously you want to put your 2 bits in to increase the VPs for the stuff you've been collecting. At the same time, you want to collect +ve "baggage" chits, which usually ain't that easy, to ensure that you drive your personal yin/yang plot cards towards +ve VPs. Your opponents will be playing "take that" cards on you to make life tricky, and you'll be doing the same to them. There's a nice mechanism which forces players to alternate between playing good and bad cards, so ganging up seems to add flavour rather than getting out of hand. Most of the game actually seems to be spent studying the cards you have and working out how best to use them (or which to spend San Juan style). The rest of the board-related actions are straight forward. As with all AP type games, getting the best out of your actions, and minimising movement, is key. Adding up all the VPs at end-game can bring surprises, as a large section of points is "unknown" - ie those awarded for guilty and innocent suspects. I'll probably enjoy this more in repeat plays, getting more into the theme, but conversely I'm not sure that the secret suspect and take-that card play mechanisms will sustain a game of this length over the long run.

I tried it the first time today (30th July 2011), there were a few doubts and many things we couldn't figure out instantly but it all started making sense throughout mid-game. For now I'll rate it an 8 for originality.

Finally a complete game with 3 players. This game has a lot of information for players to absorb, but once you play the game once, not only do things make a lot of sense, as does everything also turn much clearer. The game is actually quite easy to handle. Only after a full game did I become aware of the importance of the different seemingly "minor" things in this game! Really excellent stuff! This game is top notch!

- The rules are well organized, despite the huge rulebook of 40+ pages. Good work there, FFG is definitely improving in this regard.

I love this game so much ...it works for me ...an interesting mix of film noir crime and sci-fi ...I know there's a lot of criticism of it but I think its one of Kevin wilsons best games ...can't wait to see his new x-files game this summer ...

Deffo a love or hate it  game ...

Top notch components FFG really did us favour with this game plus a silly thing really but I love the stiff covered rule book just adds a touch of panache ...great art work very thematic ...cleverly interwoven mechanics and quite an original game ...hard to say these days ...the rule book hints at an expansion I wonder if we will ever see it printed ??

I also love the mood mechanic of the characters gives the game a very interesting twist ...

If you can't get your chums to play I would highly suggest popping over to the file section and downloading Byron Campbell's solitaire rules set " Android: Hunters v2 ...

This man has provided a awesome solitaire rules set that works so well there 40 pages long but twenty are the rules and twenty are character profiles ...they are well written and I wish I could rate them in their own right ...

● When I heard how great this game is, the three hours it's supposed to take didn't seem like much. I mean, three hours of great fun is its own reward, right? Well, that's the theory. In practice, I can play a bunch of different games in three hours and still have time to actually be responsible and productive. AND I don't have to get a bunch of people together specifically to play ONE game for THREE hours (not an easy sell). So, I bought this one, tried to lift the six billion page instruction book, and gave up. It's never been played.

Some people are into epic games. I don't think I'm one of them. I'll play it someday, but I know it won't be today.

EDIT: We tried to play it with four players. Seven hours later, one of us had to drop out which, of course, destroyed the game (since it's set up specifically for the number of players that start it). See you in another five years, Android!!

A good game, a bit long for what the game is. It is a very thematic game and to get the most out of it you would need to use the flavour text a bit more. It is a long game to play. The last couple of games I played it was at least 6 hours that was with 5 players (it may be better with less!)

I may look at acquiring another copy at some point.

I was a bit taken aback with a play in the first game we played where on the penultimate turn I forced a player to lose enough VPs to take the win with the play of a card that felt "wrong". I didn't feel clever for having played the card and it didn't see how my brother could have stopped me or prepared for the worst. Granted it was the first game, but no one else was willing to play several more 3+ hour games to find out if it was us or the game. I'd play the game again given the opportunity, but I had to let my copy go.

Story driven game of murder case solving in Blade Runner-ish world. Various ways to frame the suspect that you have a hunch on, guilty. On the meantime the story of your own character unveils through the character plots and dark cards that other players play on you. Lot of different mechanics are mixed together and most of them work well and are thematic, but the puzzle leaves me puzzled a bit: while connections are thematic and add to the game the row/column/diagonal completing does not feel thematic at all. 

Even though there seems to be some possibility for downtime, with three players there is no issue at all, especially thanks to the dark cards mechanic - as you have to keep an eye on others to find the right moment to introduce a little twist to their andventure. While getting a dark card played on you might screw your optimization part of the game it definitely enriches the character and story part of your game, so this game is a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

I refuse to rate this until the people I'm playing with try to get into the theme as much as I do. I've always been into immersive gaming, and I think this is the key (well, I could go full RPG, but there's plenty of pitfalls there, I know from experience). So the game remains unrated despite the fact that I had a blast playing it.

3/24/10: I really like Blade Runner, so the theme appealed to me a lot.  While it's true that it didn't really feel like you were "solving" a murder, that didn't really bother me at all.  It actually has quite a "euro" feel to it, particularly the conspiracy puzzle part of the game.  The game did go a little long, but that was because it was my first time playing it.  I can see the playtime decreasing significantly upon subsequent plays.  And it is a game that I would like to play again.  I didn't read much of the flavor text the first time through, but it was quite an immersive game (thanks to the beautiful board) even without it.

RATING: 8
After two testplays the feelings are finally clear. It's simple: I like this.

Probably no other game handles the lack of dice more beautifully than this. I didn't even miss some random factors created by dice. The game feels a lot like Arkham Horror (no wonder) and probably that's also why this appeals me.

There is over 300 cards to provide some thematicity to the euro-stylish mechanics. Light twilight cards contribute to the uniqueness of the characters and dark twilight cards make sure that players get kicked and no plan may be a solid one.

One of the best thing in this game is the uniqueness of the characters. They each have personal issues and they really distinct from each other. No player character is even close to being a copy of another. Excellent!

One of the downsides in this game is that scoring is a bit vague. The suspect thing is very clear, but other than that, there are no many ways to score some good points (except Raymond's plots). Sometimes this could lead you to a very difficult position when some suspects are eliminated or just too difficult to prove guilty.

The conspiracy may be tricky. Don't let it grow to every direction without intervention!

The game is best with four players. The dark twilight cards should be played equally to everyone since it's too easy to "kick the leader" in this game. You shouldn't kick the leader since you will have no idea of the leader. We have been mistaken a lot by who really was leading the game. Don't take anyone lightly in this game!

We managed to play our second game in 4 hours. A good lenght for a game like this.

After having owned the game for more than six months I finally managed to get it on the table. After all the flac this game has recieved I was quite weary, but at least I had to give it a try. After a rather confused and prolonged setup and rules walk through (1h+) the game flowed surprisingly smoothly (of course there where a couple of rules mistakes and a couple of frantic rule book searches) and the game clocked in just above 3h (3players). Not bad.
I really like this game. There is a lot of info to keep track of and it is almost impossible not to miss making an optimal card play every now and then. For the player who wants to feel in full control and who has a hard time accepting mistakes (own or others) and need to make a total analysis of the game situation and possibilites before making a move I can see that this is not the game of choice.
To me Android is an amazingly immersive experience (even more than Arkham horror). I can't tell if it is unbalanced, random or what, but I still like it a lot. If it wasn't for the long playing time and the high learning curve it would get an 8 or even a 9.

The circumstances in which we played the game was a bit of a last moment pick, I immediately knew this was a bad idea.  No one knew the rules besides myself and I had read those rules months earlier so the setup was extremely painful and the gameplay was horribly awkward.  By the time we got the hang of what we were doing the game instantly became time bogging and slow.  So with only one play under my belt in a less than stellar circumstance I give it a rating of 2.

RATING: 8.57
I see why a lot of people had an issue with this game, but if you take it for what it is, it is a fascinating game.  A character driven euro... with "character" as in literary characters.  Characters with impulses and motivations and flaws which all express themselves through the mechanics.  The flavor text enhances this, but it sings through the mechanics as well, which is remarkable.  The choices through the plot trees make you really feel like you are steering the character to different outcomes, and the tradeoffs are everywhere.  Balancing the light and dark cards is brilliant as well.  

An achievement, and it is sad the large portion of the gaming community was unable to appreciate it, because I think there is really nothing like it.  And its highly public failure probably discouraged many great ideas at FF for years to come.

Would love to explore this more.

A game that exemplifies all that is glorious and ennervating about FFG style Ameritrash games. Immersive and thematic to the max, with great components and artwork, and a game design that just piles on rules and mechanisms and victory conditions, leading to an end result that is, in this reviewers humble opinion, neither deep nor truly complex, but fiddly, overwrought and complicated. Funny how one game can be both greatly entertaining and bloated to a point where frustration reigns supreme, all at the same time. As ratings go, my '7' is probably a tad too high, but then again, I have a soft spot for games that try too hard. And that, "Games that try too hard", might well be an apt moniker for the whole genre of AT.

Got it but can't open it till Christmas, aargh, can't wait.
Finally got to play and it's awesome, great game mechanics, lots of options and beautiful production, Another quality FFG product and fantastic design by Kevin Wilson. A lot went into this game so there is a lot to get from it. Endless hours of playability and diverse roads to gaining victory points. Will be playing this lots.
Played again and gets better every time. Fantastic game, love the possibilities with each character and how you affect others with the Twilight cards. An expansion will be so easy for this game, giving one new characters with unique plots, new crimes and new supsects. The game board might be static but still has enough locations for good variety. Can't wait to play again, raised my rating to 10 for production, theme and game mechanics.
Played 2,3,4 and 5 players and loved it everytime and so did everyone else.

RATING: 4.9
This game was surprising and disappointing at the same time. The core game is simple, a murder has been committed and the players represent detectives trying to track them down in a future dystopia, a bit Cluedo, a lot of Bladerunner, and apparently in a long line of quest games coming from Talisman. But this game adds a genuine narrative sense. As you move to investigate different clues they move around, and you and your investigations determine the guilt or innocence not some random predetermination.More importantly you must balance the play of positive cards (played by you) and negative cards (played by you on other players) as you try to balance the devils and demons of your character. In addition characters have personal sub-plots that direct their actions.

Those mechanisms are excellent but on top of them are layered a whole layer of additional sub-games. There is a conspiracy going on and players can unravel it, while there is an economy of 'favours' in various different colours, a series of NPCs for each character, and a set of events which happen at various points. These all feel like the expansion bloat associated with a coin that has had layers of new material added to them but in fact they are all part of the basic game.

So in there is an excellent game. Our group has kind of wondered if you could cut out some of the fat (some of it is only tangentially associated with the core game) and leave a much tighter game, which might play quickly and allow more of the flavour to come through. But as it comes out of the box (or goes back in slowly, you can play a quick euro in the time it takes to set this game up).

RATING: 6
This game should really be better than it is.  Despite a beautiful design, great attention to detail, and a magnificent storyline, the game mechanics are irreparably flawed, your actions and choices are mostly random and don't really involve you in the plot, and for a game that takes 3-4 hours to play, you really don't seem to get to do much, or make many choices.  

With most strategy games taking 2-3 hours at most, a strategy game that can take 4 hours or more just isn't enough to keep most people's attentions, especially considering the incredible amount of down time between turns.  The Director's Cut rules help a lot, but not enough to make the game truly enjoyable, and equal to its peers.

RATING: 3.5
I found the physical components pretty enough, but the pieces didn't really stand out against the busy but attractive board.  The card text was small and difficult to read, with large swaths of card space taken up by flavor text instead of bold, easy to read game text and helpful icons.  In particular, trying to tell how to add baggage to other players plots was practically impossible without just asking the players each time you wanted to know.

Most importantly, though, the game failed to evoke the theme for me and just wasn't that fun a process.  It seemed clear enough that the game itself was going to be highly random, with lots of "take that", so it would be OK to regard it as an experience game...but the experience of it wasn't compelling to me.  I never felt like I was in a cyberpunk or mystery story.  The decisions I had to make weren't tense.  

Just not my thing at all, obviously, certainly not in this time slot.

RATING: 6
I love the theme, the art, and the ambition of this title. There is so much going on, between the murder investigation, the conspiracy (jigsaw) puzzle, your personal choose-your-own-adventure storyline, and all of the cards.... Delving into this game wanting a deep, complex narrative told in a totally unique way is fantastic.

The problem is that this game is really long and complicated to play. It has so many moving parts and different little sub-games that you can play to earn points at the end of the game that it is easily one of the most overwhelming games I've ever tried to learn, let alone introduce to others. Moreover, if the players at the table aren't willing to read out the flavour text of the cards you lose a lot of the story, which is what makes this game worth playing in the first place.

For the right group, in the right mood, with plenty of time on their hands to really dig into the setting, Android has the potential to be fantastic. I really wish I could rate this title higher, but it is rare for all of those elements to fall into place properly.

The reviews -- both good and bad -- are accurate.  Our first game (3 players) took one hour to teach and four hours to play.  That was after I studied the rules for a week and created pages and pages of player aids.  The second "week" went much better than the "first," after we were more used to the play.

The theme is as much or as little as you make of it.  It can easily devolve into a series of sterile mechanics if you let it; the theme is in your imagination, participation, and frame of mind.

There is a LOT to keep track of at any time in the game, especially the various triggers for your possible actions.  Once we got the hang of the cards, we had a lot of fun playing "take that."

My first play was not as fun as I had hoped, but I plan to play again, with the expectation that several sessions will be necessary to fully appreciate this game.

Truly magnificent storytelling.

Beautifully written.

Sitting down to the game it was made clear that it wasn't just winning that was on the table.  I was responsible for saving  my character's life, and the writing brought that message with very real impact.  I had a powerful reason to succeed, not just some point total  at the end.

One of a kind game.

The reviews are pretty accurate for the game, but I take them in a *good* way. This is film noir game, in which the players are writing separate stories for the characters. Much like film noir, the murder is unimportant. It's the character's personal struggles that are center of the story. 

In our first game, we *were* able to play with five players. I moderated and one player had played before. We stopped after four hours and after the first week of the game. But, by then, we accomplished quite a bit: The conspiracy puzzle was pretty much filled, we resolved our plots, we had a guilty suspect, and even Vinnie had been killed off!

I think this game had some unfortunate expectations, and it's not as accessible as other FFG games. But if you enjoy film noir -- and, I mean, *really* enjoy it -- play a game of Android.

I would need more plays to come to a better conclusion, but this game feels like one that is probably too dense for what it is. It's disappointing that it boils down to a victory point race, and all of the mechanics don't seem to add up to as much theme as it would indicate. But with a game this epic, one play is hardly conclusive, so this rating could go either way.

This game is quite incredibly complex. Have got part way through one game of it, which was abandoned by mutual acclamation of all involved. Desperately needs a "tutorial mode" which cuts out some of the learning curve for the first game. In particular, it was extremely unclear how to effectively make use of the conspiracy game elements. The conditionality of the Dark cards was also frustrating; it was entirely possible to find oneself unable to play any of them.

Theme is excellent and game clearly has potential; however it is unlikely to be revisited at our games club due to its lengthy setup/teardown requirements and lack of immediate success mechanically.

I enjoyed playing this. It does a pretty good job of getting across the feeling of being part of a sci-fi noir. It can be a long game though, so I must be in the mood for it. The only thing that bothers me a little is that you are less trying to figure out who the murderer is and more about pinning evidence on the person you want to be guilty. I haven't decided if this makes it more or less thematically appropriate for the setting...

Got this at 20% off regular price (due to a little dent - easily fixed - in the bottom of the box)... you gotta love a discount! I really enjoy this game, and I'm fortunate enough to have some friends that have really taken a liking to it as well.  Gorgeous production rich in theme with some neat gameplay ideas.  My only real complaint is that some of the mechanics feel a bit "tacked on," adding to the complexity of Android without integrating smoothly enough into the game.  Sometimes it feels like you're simultaneously playing a bunch of simple games rather than one big game.

RATING: 7
Over the top FFG production values, combined with bargain basement prices mean that I would be happy for this game to sit on my shelves virtually unplayed and unlikely to be played - which is essentially the situation. I can see this going down very well with the right group of players, although the necessity to learn a bunch of odd mechanics is a necessary barrier, as according to comments here on the geek is the 'fit up a suspect' rather than 'solve a mystery' gameplay - not a problem for me personally:it seems to fit in well with the dystopian sf background, and makes for an interesting and very gamey mechanic - always useful in a board game. 
Edit after a proper 4 player game: Plays extremely well and fits my expectations above. For me the biggest problems were - 
1) having to go through the rule book to give a rules explanation owing to not having 'revised' properly before play - with set up this took about an hour and greatly annoyed Mrs Schkff. Solution: prepare properly
 2)all the flavour text being a bit messy - we opted not to go through the procedure of everybody reading out their text so it was optional for players if they wanted to read their own flavour text or not. The game manages to flow on reasonably well almost completely ignoring the text, but some sense of the story is lost a bit here. As with the rules explanation, this problem was really just down to our own approach to the game, and did not spoil play. Solution: either want to read the text, or be happy ignoring it; not a particularly big deal.
3) Mrs Schkff being impatient about how long I apparently took on my turns, whilst wanting to stop and check if she was able to play a dark card on every player after what seemed like every single move. Grr. Solution: Do not play Android with Mrs Schkff.
4) Some annoying vagueness about how to use the day marker track, and a number of questions about the conspiracy board. Solution: read the rules properly.
All these problems aside, this was an intense and for three of us very enjoyable game, which in the end could have gone either way - this with a great variety in the strategy and approaches each player took. The whole evidence planting mechanic is pure genius, far more interesting than any deduction game could possibly be.

Players are investigators that try to solve a crime at a turning point of their lives in a [i]Blade Runner[/i] setting.  They get points for discovering the criminal and the conspiracy behind his/her behaviour, for defending an accused inocent and for resolving their personal affairs in a good way.  As usual with Fantasy Flight Games, at first glance it looks like a hard game to play.  The difficult to understand and explain rules and the million components stand for that.  Nevertheless, while playing everything fits in order and it is very straight forward.  It is so deep in theme that it is a game to play with a proper amount of time, for players to read the flavor texts and enjoy the story behind.  That's the reason why it shines at its best with three players; with more it could take too long.  One of the best from this publisher in the last years.

Nagyon gamer játék. A többiek szerint akik még játszottak (szinten FFG rajongók) az egyik legkomplikáltabb FFG játék lett. Minden-mindennel összefüggésben van, figyelni kell a többi nyomozó cselekedeteire, kire akarja rákenni a bűntényt. Tulajdonképpen nem egy nyomozásról van szó, hanem arról a karakterünkkel kire tudjuk rákenni a bűnösséget a szerencsétlen kiszemelt áldozatok közül és kit tudunk ártatlanná tenni. Időközben ha módunk van rá, akkor az összeesküvésre is időt kell fordítani mert akár a saját javunkra is lehet fordítani azokat. Minden karakternek saját személyisége van, sőt az egyik legzseniálisabb része a játéknak is ehhez kapcsolódik. A karaktereket a játék folyamán (2 hét) rengeteg inger éri és annak függvényében, hogy ezeket mentálisan mennyire tudja feldolgozni alakul a hangulata. Ha nagyon rossz passzban fejezi be a játékot, akkor az mínusz pontokat is hozhat ellenkező esetben meg pluszt. Rengeteg lehetne róla írni, de ezt a játékot meg kell tapasztalni.

In a word, horrible!  I gave it a few points for the beautiful art. Super fiddly, complex beyond reason, too much going on that a player can't keep track of it all.  There's no way to make any plans since other chars can screw them up with cards.  So many locations its overwhelming.  Ugh, a very bad experience.  After 4 hours we were only half way done, 2 of those hours were setup and rules explanation.  Unless you like super long, super complex games avoid at all costs.  This game needed an editor very, very badly.

An [i]experience[/i] that uses a game to make you care about an ambitious setting with its flawed cast of characters.  The flavor text, so drab and puerile in novel form, grips me in the context of a game.

Old-school Ameritrash sometimes tips the experience toward 1 player, with the other player serving as an 'AI' (e.g. Space Hulk). This one takes it a step further, with you working on the narrative of your detective, while simultaneously playing God for the other 2 players, helping with upkeep and putting down 'smart' events at the right time. And it's other 2, because 3 is way way optimal (like old-school Ameritrash, the downtime gets too much with each player having a bunch of actions to optimize and spend at once).

The engine that drives the game is the light/dark resource duality, and needing to manage it to properly time your card-play. It's fun, and forces you to strike a balance between helping yourself on your turn, versus screwing others on their turns (and there's a ton of direct screwage; view of it as teaching your opponents life lessons!); drawing cards and picking things up along the way, versus spending them to lower card costs. Reminiscent of Mammoth Hunters and Lords of the Rings TCG (hey, it's called twilight too!), but the engine is far more integrated into the theme than in either of those.

Four main things to do:
1. Place evidence on suspects to solve the crime and prove your guilty hunch (hidden objectives, hidden majority system, with plenty of bluffing and negotiation) for a ton of end-game VPs.
2. Work on the conspiracy puzzle, building a cute communal jigsaw puzzle to link factions to the murder, and raise the VP values of certain resources.
3. Accumulate good baggage to resolve your narrative arc favorably, and have your happy endings.
4. Trade between resources via board locations.

Thematic integration on all levels. Every innovative mechanism has a place in the theme, and is thoughtfully blended together. The flavor text adds so much color that you have to consciously stop reading them so you'll actually have a shot at finishing the game.

The only real drawback is downtime, since you take your actions all at once, and have lots of ways to optimize, but pick suitable opponents and you're fine. Plus I'm having a ball on others' turns reading flavor text, thinking up my next day, and looking out for opportunities to play dark cards.

Definite perfect 5 on design, and while I'm not sure this one has legs beyond the 20 or so plays the cards are supposed to provide (got abandoned expansion-wise due to the mass of wusses that misunderstands this game), this will be a 4 or 5 on want-to-play until further notice.

bleached_lizard develops thoughtful variants for several FFG games, and his [filepage=53229][/filepage] thoughtfully points out and tries to fix thematic inconsistencies. Will explore when I tire of the game.

Amazing storytelling game with a long play time and some clunky rules. Excellently captures the noir-cyberpunk universe as the player not only plays the character but also participates in manipulating the world. Complaints  about "framing the suspects" or "abstract victory points" are due to a thematic disconnect that is the fault of the players, not the game. Ditto on complaints regarding the light and dark cards. (Yes I will hate the players, not the game). If you enjoy the storytelling genre then definitely give Android a try. It may not be for everyone but it is so unique and engaging that it still deserves your attention.

RATING: 9.5
Currently my highest rated thematic behemoth (and one of 2 I tolerate). Simply put, while overhead is crazy and investment borderline tolerable, the payoff is worth it. To me anyhow. 

It's a a novel, or is it 5 novels about 5 detective on the brink of emotional, professional and general collapse in a nicely coloured cyberpunk Los Angeles of future. Not that they've noticed, they're in a noir story. And it's rough. These novels are cut into pieces, glued to cards, shuffled, a lot of thematic, semi thematic and kinda thematic mechanisms added and voila. 

Going in you have to know:
- 3 player only. (you don't have a week, do you?)
- This is a story driven game.  There will be take that effects that can make you lose half a game of progress in this or that, so it's better to embrace the game for the story and don't get too upset about the winning part. It's a good idea to prioritise personal quest above other in game goals. 
- If you're good the game takes only an hour to teach. Yeah - there's a teaching script in Android's bgg forums.
- universal head players aids and rules summary. Print it. 
- Oh yeah, probably worth saying, you're not out there to solve a murder, you're there to solve your own miserable experience by framing a murder on someone. Future is bleak. 

The whole thing is huge and overwhelming and kinda slow, but the good bit is that there are short term, middle term and long term goals and lists of things to do, which helps in basic orienteering. But given time and proper company to delve into the atmosphere of the game (put some 1990s drum and bass on) it's as immersive as these kind of games can get. 

I think I mostly enjoyed soloing it as you can really delve into the story part and atmosphere. But yeah, it is on the brink of collapsing under its weight and probably has too many things going on. And you'd probably need a second (robotic) brain to keep track of rules and strategize while your mind can focus on the narrative.

[i]75% Atmosphere, 25% Game... the Game Bit Isn't Super Strong, but it is Unique and Endearing![/i]

Will only play with 2-3 players.

Heard this was a love it or hate it game -- can't say I love it yet, but I [i]certainly[/i] do not hate it!

It's refreshing to see a game designed with such care, effort, and LOVE. This game is the craft of a man who wanted to make something significant -- when it comes to personality and flavor, it puts 90% of my shelf to shame.

[b]Cons:[/b] The downtime is significant and the game is a little messy... you probably wouldn't want to play this with any more than 3 players, as the playtime would stretch too far and the focus and interaction spread too thin. But what this game has going for it is its uniqueness. It's not being "outdone" by any other game I've played.

I suspect that the finite stories though are what give this game its legs for me. I was not as charmed by the mechanics as I was by the story. So not sure I will have a long-term relationship with this one, and conservative rating anticipates that

RATING: 3
Perhaps this year's biggest disappointment.  For all the cool elements to the design, there was just too much going in without any reward.  I feel like there are a number of cool and innovative mechanics that are just there for the sake of innovation, rather than leading to a more fulfilling game.  Piling stuff on with a "wouldn't it be cool if we added this" mentality.  

The caliper car travel and the awkwardly abstract twilight track are the best examples.  While they are fun in concept, ease and speed of play, and forward planning, all fall prey to unfortunately appropriate min-maxing.  I think it is a poor design to take all the down time from action points in Java or Tikal, and then make every action point spent tough to plan for or map out.  Oof.  

Planning was the biggest issue that I had.  There are too many "take that" cards. They are constantly foiling the extreme level of overhead that is required for decent play. Not infrequently, you will take your time and energy planning for the next turn on other players turns, but find it is all for naught. Often everything is changed from the chaos of people taking actions & playing cards. Not such a big deal.  You get the point where you realize that this is a tactical game. But, the expect people to give up planning when it isn't their turn.  

So, you recognize that you have to have a loose plan.  Fine.
Then the whammy cards come out. You aren't allowed to take your turn or you lose the work of your last few turns.  They operate to such an extreme that everything you do can be negated.  Causing someone to lose their turn is the least fun thing that you can design into a game. 

Still, you should attempt to plan your turn despite all this.  I just don't enjoy all the overhead when all of it goes out the window with crazy cards.

I felt that what you do on your turn was pretty repetitive with no real reward other than accumulating specific chits.  Story cards drive what you try to collect, so most of the time you are doing the same actions over and over again because that is what your character is supposed to do.  So you spend the game grinding to accumulate baggage to counter other player's attacks, or money or whatever a character specifically needs.

I feel that everything in this game is creating friction.  It is so hard to do anything well.  This isn't a Wallace thing where you want to four things but you can only do two.  You may not be able to do what you need to, but you still have to puzzle everything out.  

I love that you are trying to plant evidence on players that you don't like.  It is cool in concept that you get happy every time you try to do something cruel to another player, but all of it just doesn't add up.

This game is looooong.  Way to long for whatever could be the reward.  The story and color are great, I'd actually like to see more of this world, but not here.  I'd rather just read all the cards and get the instant gratification rather than suffer through the tedium to flip the page in the choose your own adventure.

Four hours in, I finally lost my moral check on this and quit.  I didn't give anyone the chance for The Bone.

Android is a unique game that combines adversarial card play, deduction, induction, and a fun action point allowance system.  The game tells interesting stories throughout, especially if the players role play a little.  Art and components are fantastic and moody.  Game is long - both my 3 player games took 4 hours.  A theme driven, complex game that rewards those willing to delve into its depths.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It's just too dang long. 12 turns x 3 players x 6 minutes per turn + 24 minutes for overhead = 4 hours. Playing with 4 or 5 players isn't a realistic option. 6 minutes per turn isn't unreasonable. You usually have 6 or 7 "action points", and while some things cost 2 or more, most actions only cost 1. You've got to move tokens around and read cards that you draw, and other players can interrupt your turn with negative card plays. So, you can't really shave down that 6 minutes per turn number any.

As theme-rich as the game is, it's not "really" a murder mystery. I've compared the scoring mechanic to Reef Encounter and Arkadia where you're trying to influence the end-game values of different scoring markers that you collect during the game. There's also one scoring rule out of left field that was dropped in straight from an abstract strategy game and makes no sense thematically.

I found the management of the personal plots to be the most interesting part of the game. Ironically, this is thematically the distraction from the objectives of solving the murder and uncovering the conspiracy. However, as my win in the last game shows, "solving" the murder gives you an almost insurmountable 15-20 point lead, so I fear that any future plays would degenerate with even more effort placed on influencing the murderer.

The theme and the personal plots were fun, but I can't see myself investing the time to play it again.

This game seems very polarizing, but as a Blade Runner-esque game along the lines of Arkham Horror -  except competitive - I couldn't resist when available at basically half price. Will probably be playing it in a week to evaluate.

UPDATE: After one play, I'm already feeling it. This is a game I'm going to always look forward to playing. I've begun to equate it to Yes' album Tales from Topographic Oceans: A work of great achievement and by NO means for everyone, but that's a whole other post.

At its core, a very Euroesque multiple paths to victory point scoring system with about 12 layers of theme added. It really does feel like a kind of competitive Arkham Horror - but rather than the board randomly throwing obstacles at you to deal with, the other players create the problems at times of their choosing to best hinder your efforts. It's a great system of introducing "screw your neighbor" rules that any rational person cannot take personally - because EVERYONE needs to play that way. The currency you need to play good events for yourself is gathered by playing bad events on others, and vice versa. A very elegant (yes, I used the word elegant with Android) form of direct conflict.

You could really explore the five detectives' strength and weeknesses - as they play so differently, honing this familiarity to produce the outcomes you desire. Hopefully I'll get the chance to play often enough to do so.

Played with 2 players which works very nicely, just make sure you use 4 suspects. Would like to try 3 players, but would be hesitant to play with more than that.

Basically, one heck of a $20 buy.

update 2: Still really digging it after numerous plays of 2-players up to 5. 5 is too many, but still enjoyed the game.

RATING: 6.5
Very unique and interesting game. Definitely has a lot of innovative mechanisms and ideas, but a lot of them seem random and not integrated together. The branching story aspect is really awesome, and the game exudes theme. The pinning a suspect is neat too, although a bit random; still a decent design choice. Also, the "take that" cards and "boost yourself" cards seem to work fairly well with a whole balancing act. However, the whole conspiracy puzzle and moving around the board with a ruler feels really out of place. 

There are a few thematic disconnects, but the biggest one is the conspiracy puzzle by far. Not really sure how you uncover some conspiracy between political favors and street favors and negative story endings and whatever. Also, there are some weird design decisions in the game. Like some plot bonuses being great for your first ending plot (every future plot gets 1 good baggage at the start), but would be completely useless if it was your second plot.

Characters are very different and all feel both unique and alive. You really want to play out their story and see where it goes. Unfortunately, it is layered behind so much stuff that it is hard to fully enjoy.

Ultimately, the game is fun and definitely interesting, but it could use a major re-design and overhaul. Some aspects just simply don't work like the huge travel times it takes to get from the Moon to Earth. Plus, each player really should know what Dark cards can be played on them since some of them are devastatingly strong.

Still, it is a game I'd suggest people who enjoy thematic games with lots of narrative definitely check out at least once. Just go into it knowing that the game is more about the story you tell than the actual individual pieces of the game.

Only played once so far, but the first impression was good.
But don't let yourself be fooled - there is no real murder case to solve here like in Clue(do) or other games like this.
Actually, what you do is to try to frame your prefered suspect for murder! ;-)
There are different murder cases to play, with different event card decks. The playable detectives all have their "life-stories" to go through - to the bitter or the good end.
Nothing in this "murder mystery" game is fixed and needs to be unconvered - instead, each player DESIGNS (or tries to, anyway) HIS murder case. You try to frame your prefered suspect, you create a conspiracy theory, you try to bring your life episodes to a good end, and you try to bring those of other detectives to a bitter one.
Once you get your head around this and the game's complex rules, I assume this can be a rewarding experience.
Don't expect to get everything right in your first game - that will just teach you how to play the game, show you what you have to remember next time, and understand what you did wrong.
I'm now waiting for my next chance to play this and hopefully I'll have the full Android-experience then.

Update 2012-Sep-03: Had my second game yesterday and a lot of fun. Next time, though, I think I will try a little variant with the conspiracy puzzle, and only award +4VP each time a player is the first to establish a link to one of the 8 outer groups, rather than awarding them for completing a row of the puzzle.

Update 2013-April-07: We played with the normal conspiracy puzzle rules, and it was fine. Limiting these points would just limit the chances of some players to score points.

It's certainly very good. I'm just not quite sure how good yet as the 1st game was abandoned due to to time constraint and all 5P were new to it.

No other game polarizes me as much as Android, at least after my first kick at the can.  During the first "day," I was seriously contemplating where among my favourite games this would lie: top 10, top 5, even #1?  I was loving it, or at least I was loving what I thought it was going to be.  After a few hours, though, I was deflated.  There is so much potential but too many abstract design decisions undermine it, taking what should be a richly thematic experience into a dry and kind of awkward set of procedures.  The flavour text may be there (too much, even -- I can't imagine how long a game would take if the players actually read it all out loud) but the mechanics obstruct the game's narrative.  

Probably the biggest blunder in the design is that the winner is decided by victory points.  The fact that this game is decided any way other than solving the murder/conspiracy is ridiculous.  And all the game's failings stem from this as players spend their time analyzing efficient avenues to accumulate victory points rather than, you know, TRYING TO SOLVE THE F'N MURDER!

Hopefully the story will shine through once the gameplay becomes more familiar, but I'm skeptical.  As it stands, Android is one of my bigger gaming disappointments.

UPDATE: I've tried it a second time, years later, and it still felt overly procedural. I've given up on it for good.

But I'm glad that FFG has used the setting in other games (Infiltration, Netrunner), because it is an eye-catching one.

I liked Android. Not in the way that I like the games I still own and play, but I liked it for what it tried to do. It has a few interesting mechanics and I really liked the story-telling angle that it aims for... but the whole thing just didn't come together for me. It felt overly lengthy and overly fiddly. I enjoyed it while I was playing, for the most part, but I didn't feel like playing it again afterwards. The three or four plays I got out of it were enough for me.

RATING: 7
Beautiful, ambitious, lengthy.  This is as much an exercise in collaborative storytelling as it is a game.  And so far, I love it.

It's tough to rate because I honestly don't know that many people who would be into this game, because of its theme, its (apparent) complexity, its length...whatever. For myself and a chosen few friends, this game is brilliant.  It's not a top-tier game, in terms of pacing or strategy, but it's a great experience if everyone really leans into it.

How could it be any worse?  Cards that are either worthless or extremely powerful... an innocence/guilty system that is as close to random as possible... 3 HITS!!! to kill a suspect.  Just insanely complicated horribleness stacked on horriblness... plus the game is not fun to boot.

Took the first week (in game terms) to figure out who the heck I was, what the heck I was trying to do, and how the heck I was going to do it. By that point I had a happy plot ending for Raymond and was well on my way to confimring my guilty hunch. I was fully intrigued by the dystopian cyber punk setting and the murder mystery opening up before my eyes. The light/dark thing is a different take on conflict and it is nice to be able to directly affect you opponent's plans. I'll definitely give this another go.

I'm not sure yet how I feel about this game.  It was most certainly not what I was expecting (a deductive detective game), but I found myself enjoying the RPG aspects of the game, and particularly my character's tortured choices.

The game is just dripping with theme, the character inner stories are interesting and compelling, and so I'm thinking I need to play this as an experience game (Arkham Horror) and not a strategic or must win game.

I'll update my comments when I play again.

About [thing=39339][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=39339][/thing] is a highly thematic game set in the world of tomorrow - the dread future, a dystopian place, sure, but not a wasteland or zombie infested. In this future, megacorporations run things and there are huge conspiracies happening. And there are laws. Mostly the same we have today.

Players will be detectives, trying to solve a murder case, while they also have to deal with their personal lives and their inner demons. Now, the suspect is different for each player, and during play, one of your tasks is to collect enough evidences to put [i]your[/i] suspect in jail. This is a neat thing. [thing=39339][/thing] isn't a deduction game, isn't [thing=1294][/thing], or [thing=2511][/thing] or [thing=594][/thing]. No, in [thing=39339][/thing] the one who did it is the one players say did it.

To do this, players travel between the city of New Angeles and Heinlein, a moon colony, going after clues, testimonies and leads, gaining favors, using those favors to receive help, access and other things.

There is also a inner battle between light and darkness, as using cards to help herself makes the players go towards the dark, and using cards to hinder other players will lead to light. Yes. Not what you would excect, right?

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
At the start of the game a scenario for the whole play is chosen or randomly drawn. Then every player receives two cards: one Guilty and one Innocent card, each one showing one of the suspects. One of the tasks is to use evidences those people fit the description received. Also, players take, at random, of personal objective to pursue in the first week, then a second goal for the second week.

Players have time on their turn - usually 6. Each hour is used doing one of these things:
a) Going to a new location - this is done by using a pretty neat "car range" ruler, which shows how far can the detective's card can reach and one hour;
b) Follow a Lead - either directly regarding a suspect or unravelling the conspiracy;
c) Draw/Discard a card;
d) Play a Light card;
e) Get a jump on the case;
f) Use the ability of a location (this varies in time used).

A player uses all her hours before the turns passes to the next player. After all the player had a turn, the timer advances (usually triggering an Event). After 6 rounds, the "week" ends. After two weeks, the game is over.

Evidences are revealed and the suspect with the highest sum of evidence tokens will be the culprit. The one with the lowest sum, will be the innocent. Players will score accordingly. Also, several things are worth points (fulfilled personal goals, favors, etc) and these can be worth even more due to the conspiracy. The winner will be the person with the most points.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Several. Which place to visit, which lead to follow, if advance in the conspiracy, or put evidence in the suspects (and in which suspect), if use a location ability, to deal with the light and dark in order to make use of good (for the player) or bad (for others) cards, how to handle the personal goals and the task of investigating the murder.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Uniqueness: [thing=39339][/thing] isn't like any other game I have played, even if the actions aren't unique, the whole is;
- Knee deep in theme;
- The sci-fi setting works pretty well;
- Lots of ways to gain points - framing the proper suspect isn't a requirement to win (but helps a lot);
- Several options to do in a turn: there is always something good to do.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Downtime: is [b]huge[/b]. Playing with 4 or 5 would be something I wouldn't advise to an enemy, as I'm against torture;
- Lots of fiddly rules make teaching the game a chore and remembering everything a challenge;
- Killing a suspect is something I find dreadful in the way it is handled. Though this doesn't eliminate a player, it is a enormous step back. Hits should only take evidence tokens out, as this would also make valuable to hit other suspects when someone already has 1 or 2 hits;
- Limited player interaction;
- The take that cards. They work well inside the theme, and are the biggest part of interaction between players. I'm not against them, but the way they work is, to me, weird. Normally higher value cards do the most harm, and also help most the player using it (as she gains light points to use good cards in her own turn), and for me it should work differently: cards take do most harm should have low value, helping almost nothing for you to gain light points, but hindering the other players more; while high value would do little harm, but would be worth more lights points. Yes, it would probably required a maximum of 1 card used per player for it to work, but I'm sure it would;
- There are several bad cards that lower the time available in the turn of other players. Add this to the downtime and you have a recipe for resentment.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like being a mix of Rick Deckard ([i]Blade Runner[/i]) with Del Spooner ([i]I, Robot[/i]) and a nudge of John Murdoch ([i]Dark City[/i]). There are no true good guys - everyone is at least half in the dark. There are very bad people, though. The future is bleak, but not without hope: there are room for hapiness, for success, for achievement, even beyond the Laws.

Anyway, [thing=39339][/thing] is a dense game, with lots of rules, long, fiddly and hugely thematic. It is weird, quirky and beautiful in its own ways. Plays will leave memories, will be talked about. Definitely not a game for everyone, as there is a big downtime, "take that" between players, opaqueness in strategy as there is a good deal in the hands of random.

[thing=39339][/thing] is like its setting: not easy to get by, but, play your chips right, and you might just do well enough. It is far from perfect, still, it is hard to look away, with all the lights, colors, life, schemes, all surrounded in a dark and mysterious atmosphere.

Arkham Horror meets Blade Runner. There is a lot to keep track of and I am not quite sure on the strategy against the other characters yet but I had a great time playing. Love the movement mechanic and conspiracy. It will take a couple more plays to really know what I am doing. I feel this game plays very well with 3 to 4 players. 5 just adds too much time. End game scoring can be complicated and you can miss some stuff if you're not careful. 

If you like Arkham you should definitely give this one a try.

Android is an investigation game where the answer is never truly known even when resolved.  This makes it more gritty and real to life than typical deduction games.  Android has a deceptive amount of interaction and intrigue.  It may be the most underrated game on bgg due to player expectation rather than implementation.  Length, including scale up with more players, is a bit of an issue.  I would pin Android as a dedicated 3 player game.  Overall excellent but the player number limitation prevents a higher score.

An exciting game with lots of mechanics going on at the same time. The unique thing about this game is that the flavor text on the cards is just as important as the strategical part of the game. You see the story unfold while you're playing the game. I've never played a game like this before. Truly unique.

Such a story heavy game... Where to start...

This game requires ALOT of time. Heavy investment into your character is also a must.

The last game i played, my story failed hard and my guilty character was killed off. I earn't a measly 12VPs, compared to the other players who earn't upwards of 30VPs. Left a sour taste in my mouth, but i still don't see myself selling this game. The world is amazing, and each character and what can happen to them is compelling. It may be sometime before it comes out again, but i know i'll have a way better time on that play through.

RATING: 4
Really wanted to like this game. Artwork and theme are amazing, but it felt like too much personal storytelling was required to become invested in what was happening. And the amount of emphasis on story diminished repeated plays for me, as you start to see the same cards again (there aren't that many).

The (large number of) different mechanics did not feel like they meshed particularly well, and made setup, learning, and teaching the game extremely long. Despite the number of mechanics, the actual gameplay felt restrictive; the dirty cop brawler character can't actually fight in any meaningful way, etc.

There is also a very high amount of "take that" for such a long game. Without thorough knowledge of each character's cards (which works against the emergent storytelling aspect), you could be blindsided and destroyed by certain cards without any way to compensate.

I really like the world and would love to see a version that was shorter, simpler, and slightly more thematic in its gameplay.

Comments based on 3 plays with 2-3 players. Unlikely to play again.

Not for everyone.  Just because you are a fan of FFG games does not mean this will fit in well with your collection.

This one can be very challenging to teach.  You're better off if you can find a couple of people who really want to play it who will take the time to read the rules on their own prior to your first game.

This is not a deduction game.  There is no predetermined murderer.  You are playing an investigator trying to build a case against the suspect you believe is guilty.

The game can be cruel.  Actually, it is the other players, acting as the hand of fate, can be cruel.  However, this is a necessary mechanic of the game, as the main way to play your own good cards on yourself is by using other players' bad cards on them.

This is one that I like, and fortunately, is gaining popularity with my gaming group.

Lavish, ingenious, and original - Tales from the Arabian Nights as a tile-laying area-influence game.  

While the actual murder-mystery part of the game is weirdly irrelevant, it really doesn't matter.  The characters' plotlines are really interesting and the struggle over their outcome is compelling.  

Despite the apparent complexity, the game flows smoothly once the mechanics all click.  It's hard to pay much attention to what's on the cards until that happens - there's an awful lot to get sorted out in your head - but once it does, the atmosphere really works.

Rating this game low was hard for me because of the wonderfully beautiful artwork story.  If you want your game nights to resemble a movie more than a cooperative game, then this may be just the game for you, though.

Each player controls a character that has multiple plot lines.  Each plot line takes a week in the game time, and has 4 possible outcomes, based upon the circumstances at 2 other points during the week.  I think this is an amazing concept.

Moving around the board felt much like playing Pac-man.  You seek out the trails that have the densest packing of dots, and often try to move in one general direction for a nice powerup.  Since all other players must watch you make your path each turn, this means that turns take a very long time, yet they are rarely strategic.

I really want to like the game, but I can't.

Beautiful in both concept and theme, but deeply flawed, unfortunately.  The story here is amazingly rich, with all the personal goals and differing story the real reason to play this game.  But, then a 4+ hour game gets in the way of the narrative, and what inertia the game has dies in a riddle of interrupts, slowdowns, and just plain wasted actions.  The writing, although corny, works well to set the mood. Each of the characters feels a lot different.  I don't know of any other boardgame that builds a story this strong for its characters.

In some ways, Android feels like it is two different games.  One is a story-driven card interaction game, with players playing light and dark cards to explore a world.  The other is a rather dry adventuring experience with resource collecting and hidden allocation.  Either on its own would be good, but the two together slow each other down to an unacceptable degree.

Long, long, long. I love the theme of the game, and the idea behind it is wonderful. However the game itself is really not that interesting to warrant this amount of game time and especially downtime between turns. It doesn't help that there is a huge "take that" factor in the playing of the cards. A missed opportunity.

Right, I had this game in my collection for quite some time, but had refrained from actually introducing it to the table after hearing other people voice concerns about "complexity","extended downtime" and "inability to enjoy if people haven't memorised the rules".

While it's not snakes & ladders, it's not really that complicated, plays decently fast if your group doesn't drown in AP, drips with theme and it is extremely enjoyable. I'll endeavor to explore it more soon enough.

Just did not do it for me. I am usually all about the theme and there is a lot of that in here. 
That being said I did not like how it was basically "take that"-type of gameplay for more than 2hours! That is too much time to play cards and effects that can easily cripple other players and they have parctically no way of defending...except to do it to someone else first!

Also this game tried to juggle too many balls in the air at the same time. 
Trying to blame the people of being gulty was interesting (poorly done) personal quest system was interesting and then the puzzle which was like extreme hard to win.

Would like to try again but I am glad that I traded my own away. 
First FFgame that has not done "it" for me.
In short: complicated, LOOOONG and vicious game that is not for everyone.

This game epitomizes all of the things that I both like and dislike about FFG games.

Good:  Great theme, great bits, novel, entertaining, social.

Bad:  Too many freaking pieces, too long, rules not "developed".

I really wanted to like the game.  However, after 90 minutes of set up time/learning, and 4-5 hours of gameplay, I wanted to shoot myself, and I ended up winning.  

Please don't think of it as a game.  It isn't.  It is a bit like competitive Arkham Horror, with the same "luck of the draw" elements to it.  Have some beer, play for fun.  By all means, don't take it seriously.

I played this game a handful of times years ago and I remember really enjoying it.  It was one of the first games I learned that was a little more rules heavy.  I haven't played in a very long time and I am not quite motivated to comb through the rules again.  But, I would happily play with someone who is proficient.

I typically love Fantasy Flight's enormous productions, those games where you get assigned homework in order to be prepared to play the game (which is a true story). In that sense, Android did not disappoint: it was deep, thematic, and narrative. I loved that you had good cards for your character and bad card for the other characters. I loved that your character had a flaw and that they just [i]knew[/i] which of the suspects was guilty and innocent. I liked the point-to-point movement system and the puzzle pieces (conspiracy).

However, there was so much going on and so much of that was out of your control. I enjoyed my game and would be hesitantly interested in playing again, but I hesitate because it was a big time investment for a game where I'm not sure I had enough control.

Too slow, too long, 3 player minimum, and any more than 3 players is *unbearably* slow. Could be streamlined easily and also there is some obvious optimisation that could be done. Overall an overly complicated game that uses an awesome universe to bad effect. Shame.

While I've seen some bad reviews for this game the theme (bladerunner-ish) and the story elements make me want to try it out.  After one play this game seems to have 4 euro-style games laid on top of each other plus a TON of theme.  I would say this game has more theme than Arkham Horror, and is as complex as Die Macher.  Need more plays before I rate it.

Android is incredibly exotic - unlike anything I've ever played - so we're lucky that it exists at all.   It's too detailed, earnest, and unusual to be a mainstream hit, so hats off to FFG for letting it all hang out.  You should definitely give it a whirl, regardless of what anyone else says or thinks.  

Admiration aside, based on my 10 games' worth of experience, there's one crippling flaw that rides my saddle the wrong way.

Like Dungeon Lords, Android takes a serious misstep in its bottom-line reliance on victory points.  It's not implausible, for example, that a player might skip the theme entirely and mindlessly gun for high-point favors just for the sake of winning.  Of all the possible ways for the game to be decided, favor-gathering is certainly the most mechanical and least satisfying.  If the game didn't have victory points at all, or if certain point categories were eliminated or minimized, I'd be more tempted to pull this out regularly.

Specific aspects of the game don't scale well, either, such as the hit-to-kill threshold for suspects.  It's much more difficult for suspects to accumulate three hits in a three-player game than in a five-player game - but I'm not going to add two players and two additional hours just to balance out the suspect-killing probabilities.

But honestly, these drawbacks aren't sufficient cause for me to turn up my nose at this piece of classic gaming literature.  Android's dash into futuristic grit and criminal despair is a refreshing change of pace, and it certainly deserves at least a half-point ratings bump for Innovations in Gaming.

I enjoyed this mystery game though it is long. The different players have different skills and history so each plays different from the others. This is good for replayability but causes some confusion the first time you play. With 5 players, it is very long.

Now in general I like FFG games.
I don't dislike it as much as I dislike Runebound.
But it's getting pretty darn close to it.

Too many bits, the whole clue gathering feels somehow off.

Then again, I'm not sure I like Mystery boardgames.

In short: 
Much to long and fiddly for what it is.
There's something cool beneath all the cluttered rules and too many bits. At this time I don't feel like investing the time to salvage it.


2nd play: 4 player
Took about 3 hours to get in the second week, 2nd day. Which is a huge improvement to the first attempt. Still not narrative enough for me to really enjoy. There's a lot to pay attention to and balancing the light and dark cards is a challenge.

Perhaps the most unique game I've played in the last decade.  Don't be fooled by the naysayers - the primary thing this game did wrong was not conform to the presuppositions and prejudices of its target audience.  The player is asked to be, simultaneously, a roleplayer, an author, a director, and a boardgamer.  This game is a treasure.

Holy theme Batman!  There is just as much theme as there is game-play here.  As such, don't play this and expect the full experience with a time limit.  Rob put in a lot of effort for my first play at this, and that made it a very good experience.

Like Arabian Nights, this would drag with more than 3 players.

This is a great, but sadly underrated game. I think part of the problem is that players need to approach this in the right spirit; by which I mean to say, they need to play this as though it's a movie, not the usual efficiency engine, VP hunt that many games are.

(Trade Interest: medium) wow... there's a lot of flavor here.  perhaps too much.  It's more like a role-playing game, than a boardgame.  i'm afraid i'm the only one of my group that fell for it.  the setup is long and complicated.  the rules are long and complicated.  NOT for a casual gamer.  But if you like your theme hot and heavy, with a storybook feel, then this may be a great game for you.

My wife chose this game for us to buy, but I think its going to be a while before I get it to the games table. Looks good though and I can't wait to play it.

It takes many games to learn to play this game. Playingtime with setup 4h+ it doesnt get played that often. Its complex with many rules and commonly forget something and play wrong which can have terrible effect on game.

On good side it has good storytelling, theme and mechanics. Dont play this with pure europlayer!

Wow...now this game is the first game that made me actually feel an emotional attachment to the character I was playing.  The writing is amazing, and the plots truly suck you in. 

It feels less like playing a game and more like being a part of a greater story.  I loved every minute of it and can't wait to get some more plays in.  

I do think that this game may be a little too complicated for its own good.

I like the baggage and personal plot lines mechanics of the game. Other than that, it's overly long, generally dry and not very much fun. This game has a lot of confusion as to what it wants to be, and although it has a very interesting theme, it does not shine through and make an interesting game.

Lovely theme, beautiful components, broken gameplay if more than three players. The dark twilight cards are way too powerful and can easily ruin a player's game from the start. A combination of bad card draws and unexperienced players can create a gangrape where careless cardplay will effectively kill a player's motivation to finish the game - for some minimal benefit to the offenders. Was this playtested at all? With three players there is more balance and and unexpected turn of events can create quite an enjoyable game.

A lot of new concepts, very good artwork, but all resulting in a terrible game. Too confusing to be played by casual gamers, too long to be replayed enough to discover the strategies of each character (who are apparently unique to each other).

For a game called Android, unless a player picks a specific character, there is no Android. For a game about solving a murder case, winning the game doesn't specifically rely on getting the murder correct. Gameplay feels too much like placing blame on suspects than over uncovering evidence - relying heavily on player imagination to see beyond the system to become thematically accurate.

A good inspiration which led to developments in other games by FF, but on its own its a failed product that I would recommend no one buy.

Masterpiece. 
Best ameritrash ever, period. The only real SF in board games (apart from hard SF of High Frontier), the only game that really does tell the story in the vain expected from all ameritrashers (and the only reason why I would play them) - the first one that really told me the story I remembered. It works mechanically also just fine, with only a few ways of clear scoring. It's less fiddly than all those decks and F...ing mini cards of Eldritch Horror. Someone wanted this game dead obviously, or it was an idiotic group-think... What was the complaint again? That there is no real mystery uncovering? Idiots. F...ing nerdy idiots looking to regress into Cluedo childhood. 
Works beautifully with two and the first game with rules checking lasted 2 1/2 hours. Setup of course longish, but not as Eldritch Horror (which nowadays is thought off as quintessential streamlined ameritrash - nonsense).
So much variety and replay ability, so much text that waits to be read. There is a review on BGG that tells everything about this gem and about how idiots killed this labour of love so there is no need to write further.

This is a pinnacle of boardgame originality. They could easily have made this a bleak whodunnit detective game and be done with it, but instead the designer drank a huge cup of inspiration lemonade and made a futuristic film noir character branched story development adventure game where you push into existence a conspiracy and frame a murderer because you already believe you know who the murderer is, you just need proof. All this while your character is dealing and struggling with his/her own life problems.  

However this is a difficult game to get an audience because it's unusual. And things that dare to do new things are often skipped for the next run-of-the-mill copy of something that has already been done a thousand times. It doesn't help that the game on top of its unusual gameplay is loaded with a confetti heap of tokens. Yet it is harder to explain the game than it is to play it. Once you get going, you roll with the flow. And if I wasn't clear about it yet, this game is an art of work, a refreshing fountain of originality.

The one negative I could tell is that it takes a while if you play with slow players and people that overthink it, because you plan your whole day during your turn. 

The gameplay is diverse. An overview at what you'll be doing : managing your given time, picking up evidence all over the place, linking conspiracy paths to score more vp's and bonuses, trying to deal with the suspects if you can, managing your characters life, dealing out troubles to your opponents, getting hit back with karma, cruising around in a car, taking a space elevator, mapping the useful locations for your strategy, bluffing with your hunch, finding out the story behind your character and accomplishing a good end to your story.

3 players seems to be the sweet spot for this game.  It is dense and should only be played with a group that is interested in getting into the theme (which oozes from every mechanic).  It's definitely not a game for every games day, but when the mood is right, it's great.

RATING: 10
I really enjoy this game, and my enjoyment is likely due to my interests in role-playing games, dystopian stories, and heady/complex games (though the intuitive system within Android isn’t as complex as it might initially appear.  I find it to be very organic.)  I agree that you should read the narrative excerpts on the cards as you play the game; they add that extra spice that brings the game to life much more than treating it as simple flavor text.  

There are several layers to the game and managing them is a beautiful challenge.  How well is your character getting on in his/her personal life?  Are you able to capitalize on the conspiracy?  That next piece of evidence is in a seedy part of town, but you’re fairly certain that you can point a significantly damning finger at your suspect with it; however, are any of the other players holding your Dark Cards and are they dark shifted enough to possibly do some harm to you if you step into that location? 

As for complaints with the game: the production quality of several of the components has been found lacking.  The box is somewhat soft, and I’m concerned it won’t hold up through the years.  Also, the layered cardstock on many of the tokens is also soft and under threat of fraying.  None of my other FFG games have this issue, so perhaps my copy of Android is an unfortunate case.  For the most part, the artwork in the game is really good, but the art of Vinnie the Strangler is annoyingly skewed, and the unnecessary cleavage of Eve 5VA3TC is sadly objectifying. 

My closing thoughts on the game:  It’s a beautifully designed game of theme and narrative, and I would classify it as one of my favorites.

Like nothing you've played before.  Visually it certainly has a wow factor, and a strong story element runs deeply through the game, but playing with any more than 3 means a PAINFUL amount of downtime.
Many have an issue with the way the guilty are determined - if you go into this expecting Cluedo or Mystery of the Abbey, you WILL be disappointed.  It's neither of these games, nor does it try to be.

RATING: 7
Checked the Director's Cut variants. After second reading the Murder and the Twilight -variants look interesting. Maybe also the Conspiracy. With standard rules the player who had guilty and innocent hunches right was the winner in those games I've played, and the huge number of dismissed evidence seemed to affect the outcome too much. But maybe the other players weren't efficient enough to collect VP from alternative sources...

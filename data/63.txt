I originially owned this game before the Milton Bradley game &quot;Shogun&quot; was released, and sold it in preference to Shogun.  The game was essentially the same, but Shogun (I admit it) was more appealing due to the gimmicks and all the 3 dimensional pieces.

Got this one when I was 12 or 13 with my own money.  It looked really fly up on the shelf next to my AD&D manuals.  My brother and I used to play this about once every 2 weeks and it really got me interested in Feudal Japan (remember that the mid 80s was also the height of the ninja craze in movies/TV).  We used to put all the light green pieces in our "fate cup," a really old plastic cup with Big Bird on it I found in the back of the cupboard.  While it was a great game, I remember that the board was kind of ugly and the three (or four?) pieces were somewhat warped and didn't always line up.  Something funny was that the back said there were extra rules which would create a virtually "perpetual" game, but when you looked in the rulebook, it was like 3 extra dorky rules that could have been easily integrated into the existing rules.  Also, Avalon Hill listed this as a complexity rating of 6, but I found it much easier to understand and play than Hundred Days Battles, which was also rated as a 6.

If you don't own this (and you're interested in the era), you've got to get your hands on one.  Even though it can last forever, due to ever-shifting alliances, it captures the scope and feel of feudal Japan like no other game I know.  I'm pretty certain this was the inspiration for MB's Shogun/Samurai Swords game.

Kingmaker set in Japan. Kingmaker has a lot of problems, and - surprise surprise - Samurai has a lot of problems. The biggest one is the unit strengths; presumably frustrated that troops never died in Kingmaker, now they do in Samurai. Problem is, that was one of the *better* freatures of Kingmaker, from a game perspective anyway, in that it was one of the very few things that enabled you to be aggressive. Anyway, not one I can recommend anymore.

Helps if you have an interest in samurai history - particularly the early period - as you can appreciate some of the subtlety and depth. Inclusion of roads and mountainous terrain sets it above the Risk-like Shogun/Samurai Swords. Wish the designers had researched the correct "mon" emblems though (Minamoto = gentian and bamboo leaves, Taira = butterfly, Hojo = three triangles/"fishscales", Fujiwara = wisteria)

Warring factions fight to become the next Shogun in Japan. My very first wargame! Actually just Kingmaker set in Japan. Each player controls a number of named nobles, and interestingly, many of these are named after the characters in James Clavell's novel "Shogun", rather than after their real, historical counterparts. :)

Take one part Milton Bradley's Shogun/Samurai Swords, add a dash of Kingmaker, then throw in a little Risk... what results is an very interesting game of power politics in old Japan.

The counter mix could have been a little better... and the 'pink!' box is a bit of an eyesore, but this game plays well for up to its maximum number of players.

Suprisingly similar (in general look and occasionally, feel) to Milton Bradley's "Shogun". Quite different on many levels, of course, but I can't help thinking that someone at MB cribbed a few notes from this game. Much more complex and historical than the MB game, but consequently longer, and quite frequently less exciting. A bit fiddly with many rules (especially one on one combat) but extremely realistic-feeling. Combat is, suprisingly, less colourful than the MB version, with men being more or less equal as strength points.

Of the 2 'feudal-Japanese-Risk' games I own, this one takes second place.  It is far more complex than Shogun, with an accompanying potential for tremendous depth of strategy, but the random events usually end up undermining even the best tactics and throwing the game.  Unfortunately, playing without the events only leads to an excruciatingly long 8+ hour game, which few of my gaming group are willing to endure...

This is a pretty fun game!  It definitely has nasty random elements that can really strike, and strike you HARD.  We had a great back-and-forth game that came down to the final turns.  The two-player game took just over 2 hours, and a 3-player took about three.  Easy to learn, but needs some house interpretations of the rules to work.  I also like it encourages attacking, something its successor, Kingmaker, sometimes lacks.  A nice addition to my shelf.

Played my first game last night, and we started without really knowing what we were doing. The game didnt feel too hard to get into, however the with the scoring mechanic and the fact that all players have the same set of tiles available to them, i can see that it is essential to keep track of what tiles a person has played and what pieces they have won. All in all the game was a little to heavy for my liking.

(Not the newer game, see its entry.)

Kingmaker done right, with a very bland presentation and tiny chits.

By having a time limit (20 turns, with sudden death overtime) and one of the four Imperial items fixed in location (Kyoto Castle), this game, unlike Kingmaker, moves to a climax and conclusion.

The retheming to Feudal Japan is nice.  The rules for shifting alliances in the middle of combat are very well done and nicely thematic.

Best with 4 brisk players.  Typical turns take ~10 minutes, so you're looking at a 3-4 hour game.  Second only to Britannia as a 4-player "light" wargame.  Miles better than Samurai Swords, if you can get past the lack of plastic bits.

When I heard this was just like [gameid=987], I was prepared to loathe it, like I loathe Kingmaker.  Thankfully, This game cleans up a lot of the problems with Kingmaker.  Staredowns in gigantically garrisoned castles aren't as common, and there are far, far less pieces of the imperial regalia than there are heirs in KM, which means that it's easier to get what you need to win. In addition, the event table seems far more brutal.  The one game I played of this ended up being a last-man standing affair, which is just fine.  Thankfully, too, there is a 20 turn limit.  That said, this still has some of the same problems, which is that it's fantastically random, and there's a definite 'eliminate the loser' component, which feels a lot like kicking a player when he's down.  With the far superior versions of these types of games that have come out since then, I can't see regularly playing this with any seriousness.

Very similar to Kingmaker in feudal Japan; the chits are less convenient than Kingmaker's cards. However, the event table allows the possibility of events repeating, and adding both duels and ninjas was a good modification.

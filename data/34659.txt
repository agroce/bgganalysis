 Jugado por mail. Juego muy bonito, bien engrasado, entretenido y con múltiples opciones. Tiene una tabla de combate muy peligrosa para el atacante, que debe buscar romper el frente para beneficiarse de movimientos extra. El sistema de suministro por ciudades y villas hace que tengas que ir conquistandolas una a una para avanzar con seguridad. Divertido y muy pensado. Una auténtica joya.

Just feels okay to me.  I don't know what it is about this game, but I just don't find myself super interested in playing it again, and I don't know why.  Maybe it's the fact that there's a whole section of battle that basically does nothing (the North?).  Maybe it's how I have to keep track of which side owns which empty, valueless hex for supply purposes?  I don't know.

After 5 plays, I feel comfortable giving comments.

This is a pretty much straightforward game with classic mechanisms and standard approach to design. It is well executed, well researched and in general, enjoyable. It "feels" right, but it is certainly not "innovative" by this century's standards.

However, I was somewhat disappointed.

This is an attrition-based system. CRT is built around step loss only, Breakthroughs are created only in an overkill result. As the game progresses, stacks become higher, factor count raises and chances for breakthroughs lowers, unless defender is careless enough to put more than 3 units in a stack to call for a Large Battle. This means the front is quite stable and it requires a great deal of effort to create fluidity, at which point it means the game is probably finished.

This may be true to the period and theme, but it makes for a somewhat repetitive if not boring game.

That being said, the transition of the armies from guerilla-style columns to professional organizations is well done. The most interesting part of the game is indeed the first half (< GT 10) when there are still a few strategic choices to be made, mainly by the Nationalists.

This brings me to the other big negative point in my opinion, the lack of choices open to the Republicans. Again, this may be true to history but as a game, it fails.

Of course, one may argue that this is the same as for any East Front game for the Soviets. In TSCW however, there is very little incentive to trade space for time because of lack of strategic depth so it is more a matter of "holding the line until the churn rate is too high".

Strategy wise, the Nationalists do have more choices but it is still limited. In my experience they have to decide early how they're gonna deal with the North, crush it or contain it. If they let this army build up they will never capture the cities there.

If they choose to crush it they can redirect many units towards Madrid and Bracelona, of maybe via the south. However, once commited in an area it is tough to change your mind.

Lastly, the campaign takes too long to play. Not doable in a single Sunday session (6-8 hours) even with experienced/fast players. The reward/time ratio is a bit too low.

To sum it up: Nice production, good execution but too dull to make it on my table too often.

The Spanish Civil War (TSCW) est un bon jeu avec une règle parfaitement rédigée, simple et innovante.
Le matériel est un peu décevant en ce qui concerne les pions. Vu l'hétérogénéité des deux armées, j'aurais aimé avoir des pions moins uniformes...
Je suis un peu déçu par la faible rejouabilité du jeu car la campagne est trop longue en temps de jeu pour envisager d'autres stratégies nationalistes...Comme le jeu est très favorable aux Républicains, c'est un peu frustrant.

RATING: 9
I have been fascinated by the SCW ever since reading George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia as a 15 year old schoolboy and, in recent years,  Anthony Beevor's the Battle for Spain. 
I chose carefully before buying a wargame on the subject and was not disappointed as Javier Romero has done a great job here. He has gone to great lengths to accurately portray the initial land grab by the columns of both sides in the summer of '36, then the upgrading of these columns into organised divisions. The debilitating rivalry between the various Republican factions is also in the rules, as is the German Condor Legion, the International Brigades, the bombing of Guernica, flying over Franco's Army of Africa from Morocco and loads more. The Nationalist player has to be sure to crush the republican zone along the north coast before driving on Valencia and Barcelona or he could be in trouble but it usually ends in a Nationalist win.
Includes a "what if" German WW2 invasion of Spain scenarion which I have yet to play.

RATING: 7
Rating after one play of the Columns (1936-1937) scenario is positive and could go up. It's an interesting historical situation with tough decisions and relatively simple rules. The event chits add some nice historical flavoring, too.

As far as the rules go, they do get a bit fiddly at times, and you'll have to house rule a couple things. For example, if you play with the limited intelligence rules as written, how do I know if you have a division or not in your stack? Since that can affect my movement capabilities, it simply isn't practical. There's also the overstated amphibious capabilities. We plan to add a 1 RP cost for that.

As far as the game play, it's a bit daunting trying to figure out how to position your troops in that early scenario owing to the ZOC rules for columns. Hint: keep them in towns so you have a full ZOC.

The first scenario may also not be that interesting for the Republican player, but it makes for a good solitaire scenario.

RATING: 6
Juego desequilibrado a favor del republicano, que puede ganar la partida sin realizar ni un solo ataque, dejando solo pasar los turnos y evitando perder terreno, ya que su moral debe de bajar muchisimo para ser derrotado (el republicano empieza con 72 de moral, y el rebelde deba de bajarlo a 30 para ganar; si el rebelde ocupa las ciudades que historicamente tomó (-24 de moral) y se cumplen los eventos de la guerra (-11 aproximadamente) no gana la partida)
La incapacidad de pasar de ZOC a ZOC enemiga y la tabla de combate que no hacen avanzar al atacante a no ser que destruya todas las unidades enemigas, hace que el juego se convierta en unos fuertes apilamientos republicanos en terreno favorable separados entre si por un hexagono.
La única forma que tiene el nacional de avanzar es concentrar todas sus fuerzas en un ataque sobre un hex y tras debilitarlo en la fase de combate normal, volver a atacar en la fase de explotación y avanzar. Eso si los dados te son propicios.
Tampoco me gusta que las unidades aisladas en ciudad mantengan toda su fuerza de defensa, siendo sólo perjudicadas con un -1. 
Los componentes me gustan (muy bien hecho el mapa), y está bien realizado el paso de columnas a fuerzas regulares.
En espera de unas nuevas reglas.

A great game!
The balance between playability and historical simulation is excellent. If you're interested in the Spanish civil war (but have no time to play "For Whom the Bell Tolls") or simply want a good game to be played in two sessions, this one is for you.
There is a 19 turns campaign, plus 3 yearly shorter scenarios, plus (if you are WW2-hoolic) a WW2 what-if scenario. The rules are easy to understand (quite classical).
GMT has done a good job: the components are beautiful and easy to use (9/16" counters is a good thing). And the price is reasonable.
Get it! You won't regret it :)

nice components, nice rules
must have on that topic!
negative after one solo playing :
-events must be read in the playbook
-lot of what if I do not care for
-no commun player aid, you have to put the nationalist and republican player aid on your table even if you are playing solo 
-complicated regarding the conversion and the political stacking (poum , anarchists and so on... but that is essential for this topic)

A very interesting game about a very interesting -and rather unkown- subjetc. A lot has been written about many aspects of the Spanish Civil War, but little about the military events. I am taking part in the playtesting process, and TSCW seems to be a great wargame. Strategic-operational scale, functional map, not too many counters, easy rules, diverse options for both players... And fun!

RATING: N/A
I proudly took part in the playtesting process. A nice game about the conflict, played on a traditional hex map. The evolution of the war is reflected by flipping counters from irregular columns to divisions; simple and effective. Later victory is usually based on attritional battles (as it mostly historically happened). Good historical and designer's notes.

one F2F of the War of the Columns scenario; winning as Republican with 74 morale.

I liked it quite a bit, although the column counter updates are a bit fiddly and I can see that the late war will become a pretty counter-intensive attrition war.

I am very interested in trying the hypothetical WW2 scenario, so this game will be a keeper for some time.

Grandisimo juego. Componentes calidad gmt y mapa maravilloso. El mapa es una de las cosas que me han sorprendido gratamente, no sólo por su tamaño, sencillamente perfecto, sino por su estética, genial.
El escenario que he jugado, el del norte me ha gustado mucho y hay mecánicas muy novedosas. El Comenzar la guerra con columnas y que progresivamente se vayan " militarizando " lo considero un chrome fantástico que le da muchisimo sabor histórico. 
Totalmente recomendable.....

Easy game to learn, hard to master. Especially if you play the Republicans, since the escalation of the war is very much in favor of the Nationalists.
What i liked is the map, the terrain features, lots of cities and towns spread everywhere, lots of railways, (in other words lots of things you need to take care of if you want to watch your back), the fact that the republicans don't like each other due to their political beliefs, lot's of historical events for which i found myself looking after them at the internet seeking for more information.

All in all, playing this game was like reading a book about this war, a good one.

RATING: 6
A new system (to me, at least) that almost ,every turn introduces new units in the game, but also changes some of the current units to improve them, as the militarization of the militia units went on.
An interesting point of view, but the Republicans have nothing to do in the game other than lose it, soon or later. It is very hard for they to get an Offensive, and consequently, win the game in the classic way; they may win retarding the triumph of fascism. You know: if you are good in the defense, you willn't loose, but to win, you must attack! And I think in the real life they had a chance, may be little, but a chance to win the war.
You know how the "what if..." can be, but if, for example, the Nationalists should no receive foreign help, or other events, maybe the Republic should win...

The rating is based on a solo run through of the 'Columns' scenario, but this is a nice game. It forces one to think like Lister and Yague, and thus oozes theme. The rail movement, combat rules and reserve function make you think ahead; and the EZOC rules make the experience taut. The event chits add to the theme as well as uncertainty. If there are problems with the design, I haven't played it thoroughly enough to experience them.

One downer is the lack of different coloured borders on the map denoting area control for scenarios beginning in different periods of the war. Repeatedly consulting a map printed on the back of the rule book is tiresome.

I think Mr. Romero's hex and counter designs are winners with their tweaks on a traditional format and refined combat rules. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Maybe the best game on the SCW to date. Classical concept hex and counter game, with typical mechanics and interesting yet simple layers added to the core system. At last, a game that reproduces smoothly the change from a mobile, column war with many non-professional low trained troops to a more classical warfare style.

After some plays I downgraded it a bit. Victory conditions seem too tough for the nationalist player, who even performing better than in real life can easily lose. Some gamey situations can develop in units withdrawals.

A little gem. Nice & traditional wargame with every ingredient to make a game session really fun. I-go-you-go system with usual concepts as ZOC, Attack-Defense-Move factors, Combat-Move-Explotaition.

Want to try again before solidifying the rating.  The early war seems very dynamic and interesting, but the mid-to-late war seems to get stagnant and become a measure of massing Nationalist firepower, inflict losses, move forward and repeat.  The events are well done and add greatly to the game (at times forcing a player into actions that are not really desired).

I bought this in London as a reward for the business I completed that day. Hex and counter game of the Spanish Civil War with several stages as the two sides get to grips with the war, improving their ZOCs, gaining HQ, air and armoured units (including Russians, Italians, the Condor Legion and International Brigades) and generally improving the quality of their units. It is a given that the Nationalists will win and the Republicans only have to avoid total defeat to win the game. They can either hold out in the mountains of Catalonia after the main front collapses or they can try to upset Franco by taking a few regional capitals (this rule is mostly to force the Nationalists to defend everywhere rather than give up territory to which Franco objected).

A low complexity game the rule set is on the same level as the Standard Combat Series.

Like how the rules changed from a more fluid situation in the column war to a more static feel as the armies organize. 
The withdrawal/conversion and the faction stacking rules add the most complexity but are necessary to capture the transition of the early war. 
It incorporates some random events, which is necessary for the conflict.

The game concept is brilliant (simple and deep at the same time), and the situation is extremely interesting.

Its main problem is the balance, as it is almost impossible to avoid a Republican automatic victory due to the bloody CRT (you just have to attack every single hex and wait for Nationalist casualties). If they manage to fix these issues, the game will be a definitive must-have for anyone interested on this war.

Very good material for an interesting and tense situation with confused fronts at the beginning.

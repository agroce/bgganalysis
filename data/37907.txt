10 years ago this would have been a big hit. Nothing new at all and while it all fits together very smoothly (I quite like the selection/coin mechanism) it really is not necessary to add it to a collection as Princes of Florence is one of many games that do it all just as well or better

An auction, resource collecting, building game with odd but nice components and good scalability- could be considered "Goa VERY light"

The goal of the game is to get the most points before the game ends (someone has filled their individual player mat).  Each round, you have a bidding/auction phase, using your money in a relatively unique way, collecting gems, mining rights, ships, animal tiles, start player points, or special ability track advancements. The advancements are tracks similar to Goa, where you: a) get more money (which is used for auctions), b) get bonus gems when you collect gems (including diamonds), and c) get bonus points for trees.  You can also get some minor bonus points when you advance far down some of the tracks. 

Then you "cash in" a set of mining rights + ships + gems, in order to obtain gems (you can also acquire the coveted diamond gems by having the most left over money after the auction, and by being in first place after the auction).  Then on to the building phase, where you cash in your gems for buildings and/or forests, which you place on your player mat (along with animal tiles from the auction phase).  You get bonus point cards for being the first (and in some cases, second) person to achieve certain building conditions.  Rinse and repeat.

The components are top-notch, the game seems to scale very well from 2-4 players, there are multiple ways to score (buildings, trees, animals, building bonus cards, advancement track rewards) which I always like, and there is some very light strategy and screwage.  A nice game overall, and surprising there is no North American distributor yet.  I was just hoping for something with more depth out of Dorn.

Usually not into this theme, but the options during the different stages at the game show a lot of different ways to go. The best strategy I found so far was to build a lot of forests, which somehow does not felt right, since the other building groups also require a lot of effort to build.

I guess the key here is for the different players to guess each others strategy early own and to prevent one player from getting away with all forests....

Diamonds Club is a very clever, fast paced game that will appeal strongly to Euro fans. The area control/money payment mechanic is novel, the turn order system is neat, and the fast paced nature of the game makes for a lot of excitement. I'm curious to explore the different strategies present, as I feel there are a number of ways one could claim victory.

My rating will probably go up as I continue playing this... it is one of my favorites from Essen '08.

Add four if you haven't seen all this before ten or eleven times. Putting trees and gazebos and ponds in parkland is so very old I'm surprised the designer had the nerve to try it. Adding in jewellery companies & plastic gems hardens the affront. The system of paying for stuff is vaguely interesting but not really liftable. Everything else had already been seen before, much too often. The counter artist has presumably never been to a deerpark.

This is an almost zero luck game, with the only thing changing due to chance being the set-up of the "board" which is made of strips of squares, each of which is randomly selected from a batch of ten. 
The game is not difficult: it's easy to explain, fun, and challenging with a number of alternative strategies such as collecting trees and pushing up their values; going for bonus cards; going for wildlife cards; and also the ability to accelerate the game end when you are in a comfortable position. Each strategy determines the way you collect jewels and whether you need diamonds and the chance to go first...as in all good Euro games you find yourself pulled in a number of different directions. Lovely.

An interesting game.  The coin-bidding mechanism is different and provides a number of interesting choices and elements to consider.  The hat-track jockeying is a nice touch.  There's even a mini tech tree of sorts that can push a player's focus in one or more particular directions.  The variable board layout should provide some replay value or, at the very least, it will keep things different from turn to turn.  The gem collection and expenditure is really just a set collection mechanism that's layered over the other aspects, but it works well.  Production quality is fine.

I like the game, but it's not deep enough to really get me.  Probably a hair long for what it is, but it's a good game with decent bits so I don't mind at all.  I'll gladly play this one again, though I feel no need to pick up a copy.  It's really the coin-bidding mechanism that makes this one interesting to me.

Inzwischen haben wir alle die beiden vermeintlich starken Strategien adaptiert: Wildpark oder Bäume.
Damit gleicht es sich wieder aus, da zwei Spieler um Wildparks und zwei Spieler um Bäume konkurrieren. Die zusätzlichen Errungenschaften, wie Bonusplättchen, entscheiden dann (auch) das Spiel. Dennoch ist die Lust/Luft raus, da die eigentlichen Strategien schon feststehen. Leider.

Buy stuff (mines, contracts, ships), convert those things into other stuff (gems), convert those things into other stuff (buildings, trees).  Rinse and repeat for a bit too long.

For me the only interest is in the initial round of buying.  This is quite nicely done, with a randomised layout determining what is available and the idea of spent coins being placed on the layout to raise the cost of what remains.

Production quality is up to the usual Ravensburger standards (the plastic coins are particularly nice), the artwork is nothing special.

After a couple games I think this a very solid although unspectacular game.  The rules are a bit creaky to explain but easy to recall.  Nice, tactile bits for a Euro.  Balance seems good, scoring sufficiently close but not too close.  All it's missing for me is that elusive theme or flair to keep the requests to play coming.  I don't think you should pass a chance to play this at least once, though.

Essen '08 purchase.  What a gem!

Enjoyed my first play.  Absorbing.  Very neat bidding mechanism.  Lots to think about and potentially different paths to victory.  Using the animal attractions proved a good way to force the pace.  Nice to see inlays in boards to hold counters.  Got used to the graphics on the strips and the plastic pieces a little disappointing.  But another very nice gaming experience to add to Rüdiger Dorn's Goa and Louis XIV.  Recommended.

Two subsequent plays.  The arboretum strategy has won both.  Will play again to see if this continues to happen.

Happily, fourth game and the one (of four) player who avoided the arboretum strategy won the game, albeit being very close.

Tetszett, hogy minden kör elején változik a pálya, és elsőre úgy tűnt, hogy a kellően sok pontszerzési lehetőség miatt jó kis agyalós játék. Viszont miután teljességgel egysíkú stratégiával megnyertem (gyorsan 14 pénz, utána fásítás), némileg veszített értékéből. De nem akarom leírni 1 menet alapján, mert ezt leszámítva jó kis játék.

Diamonds Club is basically a simplified version of Goa. Instead of collecting and shipping spices, players collect and ship diamonds.  Unlike Goa, there is no bidding, players simply pay for the diamonds & shipping tiles.  There is more to Diamonds Club than my comments suggest, but truth be told, this is nothing more than an entry level game.

[i]Posted: 1/10/09, Rated: 9[/i]

[person=381]Rüdiger Dorn[/person] has done it again!

I received a copy of [i]Diamonds Club[/i] from my [geekurl=/user/SteveK2]2008 Secret Santa[/geekurl].  I hadn't even heard of the game before then, which is surprising.  The last Dorn title I tried was [i][thing=25643]Arkadia[/thing][/i], which I really enjoyed.  [i][thing=13642]Louis XIV[/thing][/i] is a personal favorite.  And then there is [i][thing=9216]Goa[/thing][/i], which is a classic.  I should be monitoring his games more closely.

Speaking of [i][thing=9216]Goa[/thing][/i], I immediately felt there was a similarity between it and [i]Diamonds Club[/i].  The board is essentially a frame, into which are placed randomly-selected strips.  Once completed, this board forms the "market" of actions on which players will be bidding.  Each player's bid ends up increasing the cost of orthogonally-adjacent actions for future buyers.  In this manner, players can effect each other's options based on what has been selected on a variable board.  It's not the exact same scenario as the staged tiles and contiguous paths from [i][thing=9216]Goa[/thing][/i], but it feels familiar.

Actions result in set creation as well as a competition to be the starting player.  There are bonuses available for investing in the starting order, as well as finishing the buying round with the most unused coins.  These benefits offer additional possibilities if you cannot afford the actions you want to purchase (or if they have already been taken).

Collecting sets leads to acquiring gems.  Gems are essentially different forms of currency.  If we were talking about [i][thing=6249]Alhambra[/thing][/i], then we'd be using cards.  I like the fact that gems are used instead of cards: they give the game a more unique feel.  Gems are used to buy additions to your park, which is another form of set collection, and also what determines most of your victory points.

There are also three "technology tracks" in which you can invest.  This aspect of the game also feels like [i][thing=9216]Goa[/thing][/i], with only three options instead of five.  These tracks represent long-term investments.

At first glance, the goal would be to acquire your actions at reasonable costs, convert them to gems, and then expand your park as efficiently as possible.  However, it's not quite that simple.  You can't keep a completed set of gem-collecting tiles from one turn to the next.  There are a limited number of spaces to buy park improvements.  Therefore the idea of hoarding your gems and taking your time to improve your park will fail when another player fills up her board, and all of your wealth cannot afford you the opportunity to buy enough tiles.  I [i]love[/i] the tension, and the sense of urgency that this dilemma creates!

I have to say that this theme isn't the most logical, or compelling one I've ever encountered, although it is very family-friendly.  There are many decisions to make, but each one is simple enough that the game is not a brain-burner.  [i]Diamonds Club[/i] is an excellent game which may end up earning its way into the pantheon of "10" games.

Just okay.  An abstract-ish economic game with multiple levels of set collection.  Collect a set of tiles (1 mine, 1 boat, 1 contract) to make gems, then trade sets of gems to buy tiles that upgrade your garden (conferring special abilities or victory points).

The game is mostly a combination of game mechanics that work okay together (albeit toward a goofy goal of building the nicest garden).  The bonus tiles remind me of Nottingham, the "tree" points remind me of the jesters in Princes of Florence, and the orthagonal influence when claiming tiles reminds me of Hermagor.  There is a bit of a technology tree that I suppose is reminiscent of Goa.

Diamonds Club is a fantastic game, one of the games I enjoy the most in my collection. It's such a shame, that almost noone has heard of it.

This one came out of nowhere to be a surprisingly good game, although it's a Dorn, so it's not all that surprising.  I really enjoy the way the buy phase is done in this game; I'm not sure there's another game out there with this mechanism.  It kind of makes every buy phase a press-your-luck game, as you try to figure out what you need to buy now vs. what you think might still be available later.  Also, you try and plan your buys in a way that makes other items more expensive for your opponents.

In addition to the coolness of the buy phase, there seems to be a few paths to victory in this one, although some seem better than others, and I'm not sure there are enough viable paths to hold interest if played frequently. Good to pull out once every year or two though!

RATING: 7
This game has almost nothing to do with Goa and it annoys me that people have been comparing it to that game because the description made me less interested in this game than I had any right to be.

Diamonds Club is all about collecting the ability to produce gems, which are then cashed in to buy various improvements to your plot of land such as wild game preserves, gazebos, and the oddly translated "orangeries." The heart of the game is the extremely fun item picking phase which is played on a board which is made out of strips of squares which is re-randomized each round. Players take turns placing coins onto the board to claim the resources present, and have to pay more and more coins as the round goes on because orthogonally adjacent coins increase costs. I can't stress enough how neat this mechanic is in practice, well done.

The rest of the game is a fairly straight forward set collection bit with some player differentiation via the tracks that allow you to have more actions in the coin placement phase, that increase the value of one tile type, and that allow you to get more gems when you produce them.

It's not an amazing, top tier game by any means, but it is worth a few plays just for the coin placement system idea alone. Pretty accessible, fast teaching, and plays in about an hour. The kind of game that I would never need to own, but which I would rarely turn down because of the amount of punch it packs into a short period of time.

I tried this at a game night and enjoyed it.  Set collection for set collection for set collection - but fun despite the repetitive actions.  It's a lighter euro.

The market is interesting.  It's made of strips that are shuffled and reselected each round which means that the market will change throughout the game.  The prices increase as each player makes a purchase.  Plan well to obtain what you most want and to increase the price of things that will most hurt your competitors.  

I like buying improvements too.  There's a spot where each player can buy an improvement, paid for in gems, once (the forest is twice), plus one wild spot.  Like the market, the price increases according to how many people have purchased that item.

This game works with two players but the competition, especially in the improvements market, is much fiercer with four with greater opportunities to price someone out of a needed item.

Wow. Very surprised. Really nice system. Slight asymmetry on player starting boards to drive slightly different behavior. The only luck is randomized board. Nice balance between options to help yourself verses hose others. Specific "tech trees" you can advance down, but none are really critical to winning. It provides opportunities to speciialize or go general, a decision which affects one's strategy. After a couple games, I see what people mean by the dominant forest strategy. It will be interesting to see whether that self-balances with everyone aware of it, since it doesn't work (well) if multiple people are going for it. But what is up with the theme??? Going and producing diamonds so that you can come home and beautify your park, and best park wins??? What the...

Diamonds club is Dorn's take on worker placement mechanic. Players put workers (represented by coins) on a randomized grid (made of double sided arrangeable strips) of available actions. The cost of placement depends on previous choices in the turn (already placed coins in the orthogonally adjacent cells increase placement cost).
Actions allow one to collect sets of chits that can be exchanged for precious stones (the real currency of the game), or to improve ones' skills (more workers, more efficient stone digging, more valuable items, get further on the turn order track). Stones are then exchanged (following the new order) to park improvements, conveying victory points.

Though it is not overly original (apart from the placement method), Diamonds Club is brilliant in execution, offering interesting decision in a short playing time (about 60 minutes).
 
Good materials (cardboard and plastic).

Bought at Essen 2008.

The game is enjoyable, and the placement mechanism is different enough that you do not feel as if you're playing something you've played before. However, the options seem limited, as the player who decides to go for the forests will dictate the play of the other players, who must devote their efforts to countering him, or so it appears. I suspect that, before too long, one playing will come to seem much like the next. I hope I am wrong.

Very fun and interesting design.  I've heard people call it Goa light.  I guess there is a slight resemblance to Goa, but the game feels so different that I don't think it's a good comparison.  

Diamond Club is an abstract bidding / set collecting game.  It is very clean and has some interesting mechanics.  If you're looking for theme, this is not the game for you.  Otherwise, this is a great one.

RATING: 7
Based on 1st play: enjoyable game with some great mechanics - I liked the tactical placing of money for selecting/blocking investment and actions, that you then have to take forward into the building/point scoring strategy. All very clever and lots of choices.

There are two slight niggles. First, the term "pasted on theme" does not even come close to describing the disconnect between the mechanics and the theme - famous gem dealers/mine investors using the proceeds to buy garden features for their stately homes....errrrrr...that doesn't even make sense let alone represent the gameplay. Were gem dealers (who also happen to have to arrange the mining and shipping of the stones) well known for competing with each other for the attractiveness of their stately home's garden?! You may as well make a game about bricklayers competing to make the biggest and best wall in order to win different tickets for themselves and their friends at the opera - it would be as convincing. Costs my rating a full point  it is so far out.

Secondly I have a slight concern that the tree strategy might be too strong - in fairness it didn't win the game I played in, but it felt a bit too easy. More plays may reveal this to not be an issue - will be +0.5 if that is the case.

Still a good enough game for me to want to get my own copy to try it out some more - and then SOLD.

RATING: 7
Players are gem dealers, mining gems and using profits to fit out their country estates.  Ludicrous theme, but solid game.  Players take turns claiming actions off the typical Rudiger Dorn gridded game space, which costs increasingly amounts of coin, and nets them all sorts of stuff.  The main thing is gems, which require a mine deed, transport and gem type to turn into solid stones.  Stone sets are used to claim garden settings such as gazebos, rose gardens, fountains and so on.  All rather far fetched, but rock solid, fast playing game with a very neat purchase system.  Easy to teach, great bits... nothing really wrong with it.  Amazing that an English publisher didn't pick this up, but it's language neutral.

Played my first game. First thought was a Goa lite. Quite surprising game coming from Ravenburger.

I want to play this game again soon. I might look into getting my own copy.

If you enjoy Goa, you should enjoy Diamonds Club. Diamonds Club is a little more expensive than Goa.

Would need another game or two to see if it's worth having both games in the collection.

An excellent resource-acquisition and set collection game with an innovative bidding mechanic where one's bid to claim an item is determined by what has been bid around it.

I do not find this a visually attractive game.  For each round the game board changes in a unique way.  The going first mechanic is nicely done and has a bonus reward as well.  For those who like gems in their game, here you go.  Not sure why called the Diamond Club--gems of different colors, and the clear diamond-looking gems are actually  wilds.

As a hardcore gamer's game, DC probably falls far short, but as a light or family game it succeeds very well.  It's a game of finding differentiation from the rest of the players within two time frames - within a round and with the overall set collection landscape as a whole.  Add in variable endgame timing mostly revolving around animals and forests, and you find a reasonable amount of tension in what are fairly tactical choices.

I'm rather glad I decided to go for this one at Essen, because it is a rather good economic engine game.  After a minimum build, strategy options are pretty much open.  It's got a lot about it like [gameid=9216], but there are also a few possible [gameid=3076] influences, especially in the way the player mats are used and the game end is triggered.  

The core mechanism of mining gems works well, and player choices over what to mine and what to build lead towards interesting strategic approaches (such as trying to force an early end to the game, or opting for particular bonuses).

At this early stage, it seems approaching a money-rich strategy might make a difference (to the early game at least), but that's something that may be disproved easily after a few more plays.

Did you know the English upper class is dabbling in diamonds in order to pimp their gardens which is supposed to impress their neighbours? You didn't? Oh well, never mind then. I wonder what the original theme for this game was.

Anyway, to get your hands on said diamonds you need shipping, contracts, and mines. All of these can be acquired in a rather cool claiming round. At least it would be cool if it wasn't for a small issue: The stuff you can claim is too damn similar, no matter what strategy you are following. Some tiles are a bit better, some are a little worse but there is rarely anything important enough to warrant a large investment until all the cheap and not quite so good options are exhausted.

The process of turning the claimed tiles into garden ornaments that score victory points is nothing out of the ordinary.

Good enough to play at least once.  Not good enough to play more than twice.  Kind of feels like a Lite Brite with a very small number of holes and only two or three colors; it can be fun, but there's really only so much you can do with it before exhausting the possibilities.  In other words, your typical decent-to-good family Euro game.  With suitably embarrassing box art.

I hope we'll see this coin-stacky grid bidding thing again from Dorn, because it's a very entertaining system.  I just need better, more interesting things to bid for.

I find it an 'interesting' Euro.  Which is an 'interesting' comment coming from someone who likes Euros.  It's fun.  You place money to get actions.  The actions amongst other things gets gems.   You then use those gems to build things.  Lather, Rinse, Repeat.

So, 'interesting'?  I find it fun.  It's not 'quite' like anything I have that I can think of.  But, it still has a very Euro feel of having played it before.  I'm sure I'll be playing it again (soon).  But, I can see that it will probably wear out quickly for me.

It has been designed by the same R. Dorn and use a tableau to track "technologies" as in Goa (or Endeavor) but Diamond's Club is rather expanding and focusing on the auction part reminiscent of Goa.
The theme and it's relation to the engine is a bit strange, the bits are outstanding; as for the game, it is engaging and play fast. What I appreciate particularly is that your plans have to adapt to what others are doing quite literally.
However, I think that the number of strategies you can pursue is a bit limited.  And the theme... hmmm.

Hay algo de azar, pero sólo para aderezar el juego. ¿Similitudes a Goa? Unas cuantas en apariencia: tablero con rejilla en la que se colocan losetas aleatorias, pujas (distintas, pero pujas al fin y al cabo) y los jugadores afectan las decisiones de los demás en función de lo que eligen para pujar.PROS: la mecánica del mercado en dónde lo que compras se vuelve más caro cada vez.

First played March 26th, 2009. Setup in 10 minutes, taught in 15min, played in about an hour with four players. This game has good strategy/luck ratio. There is a lot of setup, however once you've gotten past the setup and rules, it plays pretty quickly. The object is to end with the most VPs. Each player has a play area where you track your income, technology, and prestigue. You start with $10 and one of each the 4 color gems. Each player is initially randomally placed on the diamond track located in the main board area. At the end of each round the highest person there gets a diamond(wild gem). The main board area is also filled with goods shuffled and placed before each round. Starting with the player lowest on the diamond track each player places a money stack on an empty space and takes that good. The cost is 1 plus one for each coin already placed orthaganlly to that space. Space are improve your 3 development tracks, (?) choose a development track to improve, one of each of the four gems, contracts 2-5 for gems, distribution for 2-5 diamonds, choose 1 of 3 animal items and 1-3 top hats. After everyone passes the player with the most money and the player highest on the diamond track each get a diamond. If a tie, each player recieves a diamond. Next players make sets (contract, ship, and diamond). The lowest number between the contract and ship is the amount of diamonds you get of that color. You may trade in multiple sets, however you can not keep more than one of any set item for the next turn. Depending on your tenology you can get a extra gem, diamond or both. Next phase you build/purchase landscape tiles from the price board with your gems. You pay 2-4 gems for a certain item. If you are the second, 3rd or 4th to build, you pay one extra gem of your choosing for each pawn there previously. You can't buy more than one item from any of the locations. Reverse players on the diamond track furthest right and on top goes first. Pass out money up to your money track and repeat.  Game ends when one player fills up their light green garden. There are also bonues ties for the first to have 3 of each of the four buildings (3VPs). Scoring 4VPs for each building, forest worth VP * forest VP track. Each set of three animals = 10VPs, each extra 1VP. Some technology tracks are worth VPs.

Another Rudiger Dorn style game. A nice combination of worker placement system with set collection management. Just like other Rudiger Dorn's game, however, this game is also inevitably showing game balance breakdown. This is as it is called Rudiger Dorn's chronic problems. In the game, what is called "Forest Tactics" is too strong. Because of the reason, the replayability of the game is low and strategic choices are very limited. Finally, I've sold this game away.

It's somewhere in between gamer's game and family game.  An appropriate amount of decisions compared to the moderately short playing time.

The most interesting part is the mechanism of acquiring tiles from the board; collecting sets and scoring is typical for euro.

EDIT: A solid game, but not enough variation after repeated plays.

RATING: 7
This does have a very Goa-like feel as there is a main board where everyone buys the things they need, its not an auction this time though, just sequential buying with things getting slightly more expensive as things are bought up. There are also progression tracks you can invest in to help you along the way, game weight is probably closer to Arkardia than Goa though. 

Some multiple ways to score and vie for a win so good stuff there, there are some little scoring races to watch as there are some one-time bonus cards up for grabs. Virtually no luck in the game, there is a random board set-up at the beginning which is needed for replay value and doesn't effect anyone any more than another. 

Nice components worth mentioning and other pluses are no real AP in the game and decent game time around 60-90 minutes I believe. There did seem to be one little wonky thing with the turn order and how second and third were decided but a small thing and of course tweakable if you dont like it as is. 

Summary - Overall a solid game as expected but no real spark here, much like Arkadia was for me, very Euro, solid but nothing new and nothing that really stands out about it either.

Diamonds Club has a certain charm that makes me want to like it. It's a near miss, but still a miss. 

The theme is fresh: early 20th century high society. The idea (I think) is that you play one of several rich English families whose fortune comes from diamond mining. The goal of the game is to leverage that for income to improve your estate in various ways. So far, so good. Families are not asymmetric in what they can do but they are asymmetric in their baseline goals (they must meet a couple of minor scoring objectives or be eliminated from play at the end), which is a nudge in the right direction. Finally, the core mechanic here is a pretty good spin on Dorn's classic Goa-grid (also seen in Louis XIV and other games of his). You make purchases from a market that it is laid out on a grid, and your purchases raise the price for adjacent items. Even that, though, isn't as tactically interesting as it could be, mostly leading to a fairly straightforward checkerboarding pattern. 

I think the game misses because it tries to be simple, light, and streamlined when it's built on a platform that's clearly one step away from being quite a bit more than that. Here's where things fall apart. First, there are three ability tracks ("tech" would be the completely off-target but common term for this) that players advance, but they're pretty tame in terms of how they enhance strategy. I feel like I'm going through the motions instead of significantly altering my approach to the game. Second, the thematic integration practically collapses when it comes to extracting wealth from the mines. You need shipping (makes sense), deeds/contracts (still makes sense)... but then for no reason at all the diamonds come in several colors (think: Ticket to Ride) and even include a wild. This rather arbitrarily leads to collecting sets which you exchange for improvements to your estate. This is basically a huge load of BS that you have to roll with. Why are diamonds themselves the currency required for improvements? Why does a rose garden require two red diamonds and a blue diamond? For no other reason than a designer choice to make players futz around with dreary set collection. That part of the game is terrible. Furthermore, the improvements themselves are simply flat point values. A rose garden is equivalent to a gazebo or a fountain. A deer-preserve is equivalent to a fishing pond.  

In sum: quite a bit of potential in asymmetric positions/powers, dynamic market (variably configured each turn), and good thematic baseline (obtain wealth from diamond mines to improve your English Country Estate). It's all bollocksed up in the excecution, though, with painful set-collecting, no diversification where it ought to be, and arbitrary diversification (of diamonds) where it ought not to be. 

Note: It's possible that the diamonds are supposed to be several varieties of gemstone (like sapphire, topaz, ruby, etc). In which case, the game again withholds any follow-through.

RATING: 7
An interesting tactical market system, but I wonder if it would be better without the rest of the game tacked on to it - i.e. boil it down to a straight auction game with set collection along the lines of Ra. Prototypical "lazy Euro" design with the whole "you can do A, B, or C which will help you with D, E, or F and you can score for X, Y, and Z". Theme is quite odd.

As often seen, players go through conversion cycles (coins -> resources -> VP buildings this time) while trying to build up a relatively tame engine to increase their efficiency. Furthermore, there are some goals that award extra VP's for the first players to complete them. All in all, standard Euro fare professionally developed and produced. I enjoy Euro games, hence that's fine with me and thus I enjoyed Diamonds Club which surprised me a bit as I didn't enjoy Goa too much which is the bigger more complex older brother of DC. If you're in for the deep end of Euros, skip this but if you like mid-weight games where inexperienced players don't get clobbered badly, it's a good choice.

I thought there was a lot of interesting strategy in this one, from when and where to place, to which path to victory one would pursue.  The randomness of the item availability gives this one a lot of replayability.

RATING: 7
Nothing new here, and (this is really nitpicky) I'm disappointed that there is no insert in the box to hold all of the components.  I don't know why, but I expected more of Ravensburger.  There's so much stuff in the game that I can see why they didn't put one in, but the abundance of bits is all the more reason for an insert.  Next gripe: what a lame theme - I don't really care about influence or riches or prestige or whatever.  Make this a game about cooks acquiring ingredients for their recipes or about bloodthirsty Black Friday deal hunters.

But the core game itself is pretty solid and works well.  With experience, this could easily be a 45 minute game.  If it was, I would really enjoy it.  Anywhere over an hour though would suck all the fun out of the game.  Everything is quite intuitive and makes sense, probably because all of the mechanisms are recycled from other games.  Still, this seems like a pretty nice intro to these types of games.

Reminds me of a lighter version of GOA. Both new and experienced game players seemed to enjoy it, the rules were easy to learn, it worked well for 3 & 4 players (didn't play it with 2 yet), it has many paths to VPs, it keeps you guessing as to who is in the lead, seems to always be a very close game, playing time (about 1 hour) is a good length.

Need to play some more to see if any particular strategy is better than others. I think maximizing gems with tech upgrades is a strong path.

Good quick strategy game with an original mechanism for the selection of the actions. Otherwise rather classic: collect gems and convert these in the most efficient way into victory points.

Sleeper hit for me as I really enjoyed the two part game of first using a coin system to claim things on a grid that cost 1 dollar to purchase plus another dollar for each other dollar spent on objects immediately orthogonally adjacent to it.  This grid changes each round which is another appreciated aspect as it never stays the same.  In this section, one claims gems, ships, bills of sale, wildlife preserves, three different indicator track improvements, turn order increase, etc.  The second phase of the game you purchase different items to build your palace/garden.  As always, different combinations of buildings are worth differing amounts of points.

RATING: 4
Diamonds Club falls squarely in the medium-weight euro category. I was able to sit with the rulebook for 10 minutes and completely understand the rules and was able to explain them to everybody else. That's a big plus.

The most interesting part of the game is the market, which is a very Rüdiger Dorn feature (grid with spacial elements). It's not really a bidding system, but it's a system that makes elements near other bought elements more expensive. Very neat and I almost wish the game spent more time on the market and less on the other aspects of it.

The rest of the game is a matter of turning the things you got into gems to buy... garden pieces. There's some set collecting (animals), increasing values on a track (trees), or just flat points with bonuses for whoever completes something first (regular buildings).

In a 3 player game we ran into the dissatisfying situation where one person went for trees alone while the other two fought over buildings. Apparently trees are a very strong (overpowered?) strategy and you really need four players who keep each other in check to prevent someone from running away with it.

When I read that you need experienced players that will go out of their way to fight over some things to prevent the game from being unbalanced, to me that means the game is broken.  Of it not broken, fixed with a bandaid. I don't enjoy taking time off from my strategy to do something that's not going to net me a lot of points just to take them away from someone else. And if I'm the sucker who does that, the other people might focus on what they're doing best and win.

Collecting diamonds and using them to build a nice park next to your castle, isn't as boring as it sounds. The game plays quick and there are many ways to win this game. The original bidding system makes this game authentic. Scores are always tight. It's not stupidly easy and it's not mind boggling either. Great game that fits every table.

And... Diamonds are a girl's best friend.

RATING: 8
A smart pseudo-auction coupled to a unique set collection system, and all by one of my favorite designers - enough reasons, normally, for this game to find a place on our shelves very quickly, but the achilles heel for Diamonds Club is that it feels similar enough to the totally brilliant Goa that I just don't see any way I'll play this when I could play Goa instead. Accordingly, the rating of 8 would probably only be really accurate in a Goa-less world (perish the thought).

So far two games in and we haven't found the forest strategy overwhelming like many other posters have mentioned.  The market system is amazing.  I expect a few games over the next year to lift it or rework it.

The game works but I don't find it overly exciting. If this had come out 10 years ago it would have been the buzzzzzz.  

Many people have likened it to Goa which I find puzzling.  Other than the grid with various choices available each round I don't see a strong connection.

RATING: 8.5
A set collection game where players are drafting products from a grid.  Each player starts with 10 coins and to place on the grid cost 1 coin unless there are other coins orthogonally adjacent to where you want to place --  in which case you need to pay the sum of all adjacent coins plus one.  You are trying to collect items that will fit into your garden.  Some can be directly purchased form the grid while others need to be bought by gems.  There's a purchase builds round where you can buy garden accessories (fountains, etc.).  To get gems you need to purchase mines and shipping contracts.  There are also a some tech tracks which provide more round-round income, gem bonuses and scoring multipliers. 

It's a quick-paced enjoyable game that's not too deep (otherwise I would rate this higher) but has a good level of competition.  The buying mechanism is fairly unique but the other mechanisms will be quite familiar to euro-gamers.

Usually when a game gets as many plays as this did, its position in my collection is secure.  But that darn forest strategy vexed me so much, I started to see this game as fatally flawed.

Would consider it.

You use actions to purchase items to develop your holdings using an intermediate of gems for currency. The player interaction is indirect as you try to increase the cost for other players while trying to maximize your output per turn. Sounds ok.

Rüdiger Dorn has designed some real gems (pun intended) such as Goa and Traders of Genoa.  Diamonds Club is a notch below those games, but is a very fun hour long game.  The core mechanic of placing your coins on the grid is very clever.  There are several paths to victory all of which require paying close attention to what your opponents are doing.

Set collection Euro with a great "auction" mechanism in which placing a coin on a grid raises prices for adjacent spaces. The game's scoring requires that players keep tabs on each other, as there are several ways for a runaway leader to emerge. This is a contrast to many contemporary Euros, in which each player can comfortably do their own thing. A feature, not a bug, I think.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite games of the 2009 Gof. I played 4 times and enjoyed each one, though I am starting to think that the forest strategy may be a little too powerful. If only one player focuses on forests it seems to be an almost guaranteed win, but experienced players should be able to recognize it and do something about it.

Again, this is another surprise hit for me as I normally am not the biggest fan of what I call "resource-churning" games. In this one, you spend coins to get gems to get tiles to get points. The phases all work together beautifully and the decisions are interesting without being brain-burning. I definitely want to add this to my collection, though my rate of play will have to drop from 4 games a week or I'm pretty sure I'll burn out on it quickly! :)

Not bad if played fast. Use money, to change turn order, to collect animals or to collect a set of ships, writs and jewel markers that together can buy jewels. Jewels can buy landscapes or trees, that along with animals can earn VPs. The cost of landscapes and trees can increase for players late in turn order. Animals earn the least VPs, landscapes earn more and trees can earn the most after full development. There is also development for getting more money or earning more jewels per collected set. Game ends after the total of trees, landscapes and animals in one player's collection reaches a certain number.
Paths to victory in this game may include getting lots of animals fast and finish the game early, or developing the tree track and getting lots of trees, or developing the jewel track, buying many jewels and getting landscapes fast thereby earning landscape bonuses. Money track development can help equally.

I've always wondered why what's been deemed a classic Euro was so expensive until I finally got my copy and saw more pieces tumble out than sand grains on a beach. It's a simple premise (get things, buy VP things) but well executed. The action-taking phase has been given a new twist (with variable cost dependent on what's been taken before), and there's a nice tension between wanting to take things to spend, and investing in position so you can take things more cheaply in the spend phase. Different ways to invest and obtain victory points leads to a tightly balanced and interesting mid-weight Euro. I like it.

Like many Dorn games, Diamonds Club revolves around picking up items from a two-dimensional grid as well as advancing on a tech track.  There are a few concrete strategies in this game, and you have to decide early what track you're going to go down.  I've only played this with 3, and I think it would be better with 4 because there'd be more competition for those strategies.  Overall, it's a pretty fun game, but I'm not sure it has a huge amount of strategic depth.

It's easy to tell if you'll like this game -- if you enjoy set collection style games then you'll like this game a lot. You collect gems so you can buy buildings that are worth victory points in the end. I like set collection games, so this was a good one for me.

A rather forgettable set collection game.
You bid mines and contracts to build sets of gems, and to get money for the next turn, then use those sets to buy sets of improvements to your property.
Yawn.
The most interesting part it the available mines, contracts and other items are put out in a grid and the bid price increases as each adjacent location gets bid on. That is no bids 1, one adjacent bid 2, 2 adjacent bids 3....

The game has great components and I like the way you get your stuff. It is a mingle between auctioning and workerplacement. There are many places where you can get things and you have to pay as many as one more coin than there is in total adjacent to that place.
Furthermore it is a nice paced game.

Fairly decent light-medium game.  The most interesting mechanic is choosing the spaces on the board, how the values go up next to spaces that have already been chosen.  Makes for some interesting defensive play.

Diamonds Club is pretty cool.  I like the almost area control aspect of the first part where each player is buying board space.  It's neat the way that coins are almost like actions and the better you utilize your coins, the more actions that you can take.

The art and the components are top notch.

The thing that has me less than excited is that after one play it already feels like there is one strategy that is stronger than the others.  It is really unlikely to win if you don't at least dabble in the tree strategy.  For that reason, I'm not sure that I'd be interested in playing Diamonds Club that many times.  But as an interesting and different curiosity, Diamonds Club is worth a play every now and again.

Spatial action selection (where the cost of each action chosen is equal to the number of adjacent actions selected + 1). Actions are used to do a variety of things -- e.g. improve abilities in multiple tracks (such as income, or a game-end VP multiplier for forests in your park), to acquire building or animal tiles, to acquire ships/contracts/mines -- which result in the gems used to build our one's park, etc. There are many ways to score, e.g. by building forests and increasing your forest "multiplier", by completing sets of buildings that pay out large VP bonuses, or to cheaply complete the park with animals before players with long-term strategies can gain a foothold in scoring. Plenty of player interaction (e.g. coin cost during tile selection is influenced by adjacency, gem cost when building out one's park is influenced by others having build in the same park region, etc.).

2+.

A pénzéből mindenki vásárolhat állatokat, pontnövelőket, vagy hajót+levelet+drágakövet, melyet beváltva kap igazi műanyag köveket. És ezekből különböző kötelező és szabadon választott épületeket megépítve szépíti a saját parkját.

Buy, exchange, build and score. A well balanced game with a feeling of progress all the way through the game. Has a unique buying mechanism when buying resources where each round a new buying board is constructed and players buy the resources by placing a coin on the tile. If there are already coins in adjacent tiles you need to place as many extra coins as there are there. New mechanism at least for me.

Elegant theme ... very elegant design. Dorn's games always have this grid pattern in the middle and I like it. This game is very deep compared to its game weight lightness. Very intuitive, interesting mechanics and easy rules ... a lot of ways in strategy and victory. The components are top-notch and especially the plastic pieces are well shaped and unique. I wonder why there's only one single edition of this game (German). It definetely deserves at least an English edition.

This is maybe the most underrated game I own.  The set collection aspect may not be groundbreaking, but the buying mechanic is terrific (and original and grid-based, which is a bit of a Dorn specialty).

Ami a másik hiányossága, hogy a fákkal bőven meglehet nyerni, én simán és nagy pontelőnnyel nyertem így. Elmondás szerint egy előző partiban szintén megtörtént ugyanez. Meglátjuk mit hoz a jövő.

Seems like the obvious thing to do is bu trees and upgrade your tree tech. However, I guess if everyone fights over that (see: action track in Hansa Teutonica) then it will come down to the other things.

I Didn't feel much like I cared [i]which[/i] gems I got, I just wanted to get gems - and I wasn't even going for trees (thought everyone else would so did something else). I got 2nd by 2vp.

At first this game might seem a little odd.  The theme of being a rich guy who's trying to lay out his mansion might not seem all that riveting, but it is a fun little game.  The board leads to interesting bidding and the different boards mean that everyone starts looking for different tiles to pick up.  Not a bad game and the fact that it plays quickly - an hour at most with teaching - is a big perk.

Diamonds Club -- Played once; three-player.

Great production design, implementation, and quality.

I was concerned that the multi-stage process for achieving one's goals would be ponderous, but I found it engaging.  The only part of the gameplay we found fiddly was the varying turn order, but after a couple of rounds, we had no difficulty with this.  In fact, the turn order (and the ability to manipulate it) fit  well into the balance of the overall game.

Played at BGGcon and enjoyed it. Uses the "urinal mechanic" (so called by Dan Manfredini): you choose actions on a board by paying a coin, but you must pay extra if you want to choose spaces adjacent to occupied spaces, heh. Many ways to develop your estate (to score points), combined with the pleasant action selection make this an effective, fun, fairly light game. I could see this as a post-gateway game to get new gamers into something deeper than Ticket to Ride.

Note: not colorblind friendly. I can actually tell the red and green gems apart (the physical pieces), but have a hard time telling the colored gem icons apart on the board/tiles. Could be resolved with a simple markup on the cost spaces (or if they had used different shapes for the different gems).

A Goa alkotójának játéka, de le sem tagadhatná. Licit, ami azért jóval másabb a Goáénál, de ugyanúgy nagyon érdekes és jól működik és fejlesztési sávok, amik szintén mások és egyszerűbbek a nagy elődéénél. A Gyémánt Club elnöki székébe pályáznak a játékosok ezért minél szebb parkokkal versenyeznek egymással. Egy licitálás során lehet épületeket és drágaköveket szerezni, majd ezekből vásárolni további épületeket. A játék nem túl bonyolult, akár családinak is elmegy. Nagyon szép a kivitel, mindenre gondoltak a készítők. Abszolút tetszett. Talán csak azért nem adnék nagyobb pontot így elsőre, mert annyira nem változatos maga az építés.

RATING: 8
Very clever action drafting system with variable pricing based geographically on how others buy in.  Highly interactive.  Nice little objectives to keep yourself occupied.  Many little tech advancements to develop make for fun decisions.

The variable board throughout the game makes for less game to game optimization and more tactical assessment which will allow this game to have some legs. The decision making process is the same, but the decisions themselves won't be.

Dorn has made yet another great game.

The theme is ridiculous and awkward, but in a way it is so absurd that I've enjoyed embracing it.

Since when has Ravensburger been putting games out in square boxes (Pueblo is the only other exception that I can think of)?

Really, really cool game.  There's an auction/area control round to obtain the tiles that you need and then multiple paths with different tech tracks that give you various bonuses.  It's a bit different from most games that I've played, so I'm glad to have it part of my collection.  Lovely bits as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Similar feel to Goa in some ways:
- auction is on a grid, but choices limited not by path chosen but by previous bids, which increase cost of adjacent goods ... very cool!
- technology tracks which improve abilities in several areas (some with direct VP)

But lighter and therefore maybe more likely to make it to the table?

--- Summary ---
Get 10 coins at the start of each round. Randomly set up the auction grid. In turn order, pass for rest of round OR buy an item from the grid: cost = 1 + #coins in orthogonally adjacent spaces (place spent coins on item acquired). Items include
- boats
- contracts
- gems
- movement on turn order track
- statues?
After Auction round, player furthest on Turn Order track and player with most money each get diamond. Then use boat/contract/gem sets to acquire gems of appropriate color (use smallest number showing in set). May only save 1 of each type of tile from turn to turn. Then, in turn order (till all pass), use action spaces on the board to convert gems to landscape types; pay an additional gem (any type) for every other player marker already in action space.

As players acquire landscape tiles, they may fulfill special VP conditions and acquire the matching tiles (e.g., first to have 5 rose gardens, etc.).

Game ends when any player fills their board. Get VP according to types of landscapes (each gets different amount based on #/type collected). Most VP wins.

Overly formulaic euro that feels uninspired and boring.  It seems like I've seen the different mechanics here hundreds of times before, such as the obligatory bonus victory point cards for certain combinations.  After a second play, I liked it a little better.  The scoring is a little convoluted to me.  It feels non-intuitive.  Then again, I love Ra and you can say the same thing there, so who knows!  Maybe I need to play it again...

Very nice 'deep' family game by Dorn. I like the money placement system a lot. The game seems to offer three strategies; after three plays, I suspect the forest strategy may be a bit too powerful, whereas going for animals won't get you far. But it all depends on what the other players do. If they let you upgrade and get the forests cheaply, they deserve to lose. A keeper.

RATING: 10
It took us a long time to break this one out to try it, mainly due to other reviews and comments concerning its "set collection for more set collection nature."

While this is somewhat of an accurate description it belies the true nature of the game which is viciously competitive, highly interactive, and delicately balanced.  Whereas set-collection typically has a small amount (or even no) interaction, this game requires the players to keep a constant eye on both their own ability to follow a progression as well as attempt to block or at least make very expensive, their opponents' progress paths.  With all the information being open it makes for a very very tight game.

There is just enough luck added by the randomized market each turn to keep it interesting and force some tactical decisions to change direction.

The trees are FAR from overpowered, in fact they are a useless path to victory on their own (against skilled gamers).  They are however, a source of significant pressure.  They can be used to time the game end to some extent, either by forcing it to end early by taking up slots (works well with animal/tree path) since you can add up to 3 trees per turn (but you opponents would be fools to let you do this), or slow it down by forcing your opponents to add tree-power to their own boards (at the expense what they really want to build).

Excellent!

We broke this out again, at least a year after it last saw play, and I must re-iterate, this game, at least with 4 players, is Fantastic!  It is one of the most interactive and contentious games, and if you are a competitive gamer, you do yourself a disservice to listen to the naysayers.  In general we tend to like games where the players influence the games timing, and this game is that in spades--this happens on several levels, firstly in the buy-phase as there are mini-rushes on certain gems/shipping, then on your actual garden acquisitions, and finally there is a great overall timing mechanism for the entire game.

The game is easy enough to teach to anyone, quickly and easily, but luck is very minimal, and will only play a factor if someone is entirely focused on one scoring path.  This means it is not really suitable for experienced players to play with sensitive newbies, and the new players will be demolished.  This is not a bad thing, by any stretch, since better players should always win, but it does mean the experienced players will need to tone down their game, or try unusual and different strategies, if they need to spare the new players.  Although I agree with Terry above, the buy-phase has an auction-esque placement strategy that is lenient toward new players, since they dont have to bid without knowledge (as in a Age of Steam, or Modern Art style auction), they will find themselves rapidly out of money as the other players cause the cost for competing  tiles to skyrocket.  So just be gentle with new players ;)

Components are amazing, but the sheer number of tile stacks, makes set-up and take-down, a teensy bit slow for the length of the game.

I'm bumping this one up to a 10--it's really stood the test of time, amongst very competitive players, and is extremely strong even in my extensive game collection!

FANTASTIC!

I really like the coin placement (auction with spacial element) and the race for first player.
The rest is pretty meh: theme is pretty ridiculous, resources collecting is fiddly, building is uninspired and the set collecting and scoring is the same you've seen in a thousand Euros before.
This is surprisingly more deep that I would have taught (especially from Ravensburger).  With everything out in the open, this game could bug down into an AP mess with the wrong players.

I really like this game, but I'm concerned about the  balance.  The Tree strategy seems unbeatable.  I'm not sure I can stand that.

EDIT***********************************

It appears that the only way to really prevent the tree player from winning the game is to rush the end of the game.  That's completely ludicrous from my viewpoint.  I really dislike games where controlling the end is such a massive component of playing.  I'll pass on this one.  Any interest in trading or buying, please Geekmail me.

I really liked the tactical 'auction' type part where you are selecting the different actions that you can take each round.  But I agree with the sentiment that in the end, you are collecting sets of stuff with those actions, to purchase sets of things, to get sets of something else, in order to score victory points.  More of the same interesting gameplay, but ultimately dry and boring.

Korrekt játék, bár számomra csalódás volt. Nagy kedvenceim a szerző játékai, de ez inkább vallott Stefan Feld-re (akinek a művei cseppet sem a kedvenceim), mint a Goa vagy a XIV. Lajos szerzőjére.

Ékköveket gyüjtögetünk, aztán az ékkövekből épületeket/fákat/állatokat építünk/szerzünk a kertünkbe. Ezek aztán győzelmi pontot érnek egyszerű számolás alapján. 

Valahogy olyan rosszul sikerült a játék kialakítása is, mint ahogy a téma is. De tulajdonképpen nagy baj nincs vele, közepes, játszható játék.

Egy egyedik játékmechanizmus van benne, mégpedig az akciómezők drágulásának a folyamata. De ez is kicsit laposnak tetszett. A játékosok az elején elveszik az olcsó helyeket, és a végén kell meggondolni, hogy a maradék pénzünket melyik drágább akcióra rakjuk rá.

Van még benne 3 fejlesztési sáv a Goa-hoz hasonlóan, de itt ezek nem a játék lelkét alkotják, hanem csak amolyan mellékes mechanizmus. Viszonylag triviális, hogy mikor melyiket kell feltolni.

Ebből is úgy látom tehát, hogy Rüdiger Dorn megpróbál a könnyedebb játékok felé elmozdulni, és így néha sikerült jó játékot is csinálnia (pl. az Arkadia nagyon tetszett), más próbálozása viszont lapos. Reméljük lesz még igazi Dorn féle komplex játék, és talán a könnyedebb játékok terén is alkothat még néhány gyöngyszemet.

After five or six plays, I'm giving this in initial rating of 9 ... something I rarely do. Diamonds Club is that good, and very likely to end up my favorite game of 2008 (although I just discovered this early in 2009). Only about 15 of the nearly 900 games I've rated have received a 10, but Diamonds Club could easily join that exclusive company. This game has a wonderful auction/bid-placement system that allows planning, defense and forces difficult choices. It's also more forgiving for newer players, who don't have to pull a value out of the air as in some auction games. The paths to victory are numerous, and with experienced players the game plays quickly. The one downside: Diamonds Club probably requires players of equal skill level who can keep each other in check. If one player is left to grab all the park animals by themselves, for example, they will likely win in a landslide. Another small drawback is the theme, which isn't terribly exciting. However, the game is streamlined and very well designed, the bits are terrific and the gameplay challenging. Definitely a game worth trying. Update: After 20+ games of Diamonds Club, this game now merits a 10 rating for me. It remains fun and challenging, and multiple plays have clearly demonstrated that no one strategy is best. It continues to get table time several years after being introduced to my game group. I find Diamonds Club a superior game in all respects.

At the center of Diamond's Club is a fast, fun, and above all, FRESH bidding mechanism.  It’s a beautiful presentation, too.  And everything else--more than half of the game--is dreadfully routine.  Buy this, buy that, convert some of those things into something else, combine the rest of those things to get some victory cards.  Rinse, repeat.  The whole affair ends suddenly.

Good game. You gotta pick out a strategy & go for it. If you change mid-sream, you might be in trouble.

Why in the world did this not get imported?  Seems like a very good game after my first two plays.

Still fun after six plays, but I'm wondering if it's a bit samey.  Avoiding the tree track seems like suicide, the coin track doesn't seem to pay off well enough, and rushing the end with a few animal reserves (3 or 6) seems to pay off.  Maybe it's that most of my plays have been teaching games, and this will tighten up with experienced players.

A cute auction game with a novel spatial mechanic. Might be a little unbalanced in different paths to victory, but a player can only do what others let them.

Meh at best. Interesting mechanics going on but the game itself is just a bit dull and lacks tension.

Frequently compared to Goa because of the way in which the available things to purchase are displayed and selected, but really nothing like Goa at its heart. Diamonds Club appears after my one play to be a simpler and more straightforward design than Goa, with slightly less convoluted scoring. This was one of those games that was very mediocre in my mind, which I don't mean in a bad way because I'm on the fence about buying it, but it didn't really stand out enough to purchase. And the one thing that really stands out about it if anything is its theme, which I find fairly off-putting.

A fun Princes of Florence type game where players develop the grounds of their estates. Some set collecting and a creative action selection mechanic that utilizes a central board that changes every turn.

RATING: 8
Excellent components, simple rules, exciting game. A problem (depending how you see it) is that at the end the player that will end the game knows (or he can learn by checking the other players gardens) if he will win or not and thus decide if he wants to end the game or not. I wish the game had a victory point track to record and update your victory points.

The materials suggest sitting at a very complicated game but that's not the case. The rules sink in fast and that fast it becomes a very well designed and fun game to play.

I like the mechanisms, and I really want to like the game, but I never saw a building-intensive strategy win. In games that went longer, trees won, and in shorter games, animals won. This drops the rating about 2 points.

Despite its unappealing theme, I really like playing this game with four players (although it scales down to two well enough). This mainly has to do with the very original action selection mechanic (selecting an action makes the neighbouring actions more expensive to select), the variable board layout (actions and distribution change in-between rounds!) and some nice looking components. Also, the game is very tactical, ensuring replayability. All in all, a highly enjoyable midweight euro game from Rüdiger Dorn which I like more the more I play it!

Three plays.  In two of those games, one person followed a forest strategy, and won by 15-20 points.  In one case, it was me: a player taking animals almost ended it one turn early, and had he done so, I think I would still have won but narrowly; had another player also been planting trees, I probably would then have lost to animals.  I like the game, and I don't think it is broken, but I'm disappointed that the success of a strategy seems dependent on other people's choice of strategy - rock-paper-scissors with more complex victory conditions.

RATING: 8
Very enjoyable. *Extremely* fast. Get some gems, buy some animals, or a pagoda, repeat a few turns, and boom, game over, add up the scores. 

For two players, we roll a die and add some unused player pieces on some random spots, which raises the prices and makes it like there's a bit more competition.

Forests are definitely very powerful.

This was almost a game that I bought without having played it, months ago, when I was thinking that I could always trade it if I didn't like it.  I'm glad that I didn't, because there's just nothing terribly exciting about this game to me.  I just saw that someone posted a review that's titled, "Set collection for set collection for set collection" (or something), and that's about it.  The "bidding" mechanism is interesting, but the game overall was just ... meh.  It works, but it just doesn't thrill me.

Better than a "solid 7" game, this one borders on a gamer's game.  The theme doesn't thrill me and comes across as very hoity toity which is why this game probably didn't do so well.  However, the game play is solid and there's plenty of strategy and decision making to be had.  Glad I added a copy to my collection.

Has all of the usual worker placement issues, only magnified.  If by happenstance someone grabs an action that you want to take, not only do you potentially lose the ability to take that action but it also makes surrounding actions more expensive.  So any given player can chip away at another player's scoring options by sheer luck.

This game also has its feet squarely planted in the "everybody gets points! hooray!" design scheme that has become popular in recent years.  There are so many independent means of gaining VP in Diamonds Club that it's nearly impossible for everyone not to do at least respectably well.  If the other players focus on four of the six main avenues for scoring, for example, then by default that leaves two scoring avenues for you.

Essentially, the game - not just this one, as there are many that fall into this category - shoehorns players into following leftover "strategies" if they want to be competitive.  Some people call the resulting style of gameplay [i]balanced[/i].  I call it lots of other things.

You purchase items on a grid that is randomized each turn. Base price is 1 coin but if an adjacent item has been purchased, it cost additional coins for each coin on the adjacent square. You need a set of ship, jewel mine, and letter to get jewels. Each ship and letter has a number from 1 - 5. The lowest number determines how many jewels you get. You can turn in more than 1 set on a turn but you cannot hold more than 2 different items for the next turn. The jewels are then used in combination to improve your land with various types of woods, buildings, and wildlife. There are bonus points for things such as 3 of the same buildings, 3 different wildlife, 5 different buildings, etc. You have to purchase wisely, spend the jewels wisely, and get the bonus points. This is a good Euro.

Another Dorn title that I really like. 

Nothing in the game strikes me as terribly original but I really enjoyed playing. All of the pieces work very well together. It moves quickly, it is attractive, easy to pick up rules, good replayability and it still has enough planning to keep it interesting for gamers.

Update: Still going strong. Are the trees too strong? I do not think so at this time but I need to examine this with further plays.

One of the best games I've played at the 2008 BGG.con and quite possibly my favorite out of Essen this year.  I love how the market phase is resolved.  Definitely the most unique mechanics I've seen recently.  The tension lies in the decision to either claim the tiles you need or to advance the tracks.  Don't overlook the importance of play order, especially during the purchasing part.

If I have any complaints it would be that the tree strategy seems to be too good, especially when it is unchecked by other players.

As a self-confessed Rudiger Dorn fan this is right up my alley. The theme is pretty ridiculous though! It plays quickly and so smoothly with just the right weight of decision-making. Legitimate different paths to victory too. A shame that its hard to find but I'll keep my eyes out for a copy.

I really enjoyed the mechanisms of this one, although apparently we played with incorrect action purchasing rules (the kind game-teacher later informed us of his mistake) that lengthened the game a bit.  As a shorter game, I think I would enjoy it a bit more.

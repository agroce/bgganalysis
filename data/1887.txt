RATING: 7.5
A very good card game that has locations to attack and defend. The different factions and their special abilities to win is a great bonus. The clash of great armies on the field and the squaring off between leaders of those armies are fantastic. Wished other games would mimic that design.

The ways the game could end is also a great improvement to the MtG idea.

The storyline is much batter than MtG but that is to ones' taste.

Overall more satisfying than MtG, though a tad longer in gaming time.

I have no interest in Japanese culture whatsoever, but I used to play this great CCG a lot. I liked the contrasting duelling and battle aspects, and one deck ("if it isn't a goblin it's not going in") which actually won as many as it lost. The art is great, but as like most CCGs it could become a cash cow if you want to build powerful decks. Very playable without these cards and given the chance I would play again.

This CCG has a great setting, and the idea of a whole storyline evolving around the tournament results is huge. Too bad AEG has messed too many times with the rules and card balance...

RATING: 6.5
While I like the game, the fact that each arc goes out after each few years just cannot keep me interested in this. Worst was that the cards dropping in value once it is out of the arc.

I like the storyline, art and factions of the Legend of the Five Rings, however, the constant drain in finances just cannot keep me interested in this game as it does't make sense. Should this become something like Netrunner where the cards continue to be legal, it might interest me.

L5R filled many hours on my weekends in 1998 and 1999.  This game was the first that I could recall that included multiple victory conditions.  The theme set this game apart for me and I absolutely loved the varied decks you could build.  Tons of strategy involved so the game never got boring for me.  I have plenty of cards from the Imperial set up to Honor Bound.  I'd love to play this again but CCG's have lost their flavor in my circle.  The cards are OOP too...

I don't know much about CCGs, but when I found 335 L5R cards, I knew I'd better snap them up. The beat up box that they came in says Lotus Edition on the front. However, I don't know if all of them are from that edition. There are 156 with the black back, 173 with the green back, and 6 with a green back where the five rings are intertwined. A very small percentage of them seem wrinkled due to how they were boxed (2-3%?). Please contact me for more specifics if you're interested.

I also enjoy the additional challenge of building two decks that will synergise with each other to defeat your opponent.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable, but the must enjoyable games seem to be between two decks trying to win via province destruction.  Then, the next most would be a "non-battle" deck versus a battle deck.  Finally, the most boring interaction would probably be between two non-battle decks... one deck trying to win via honor, and the other via dishonor... takes a long time!

So, I'm not sure if the alternate victory conditions of L5R are actually good design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Probably my favorite of the CCGs not necessarily due to better play mechanics but mostly due to the ongoing storyline shaped by the player base.

Certainly in the earlier editions there was a VERY strong buy in from players to play their favorite Clan, and not sell out to whatever deck is the most popular.  This went away at one point and leaves this game down one spot from an 8 due to that fact.

By far the best casual play of the CCGs.

Great CCG - AEG works hard on the setting and pleasing the warm and welcoming playerbase.  The game is strategically deep, tactically complex and endlessly fun.

I dunno, I found this game to be too Magic-derivitive to make it worthwhile. Eliminating the timing issues was a big plus, but while the game might be equal or superior to Magic in some ways, it just didn't seem to be different enough to overcome Magic's huge installed base. Also, it has way too many expansion sets.

Loved this game.  Unfortunately it became a bit too complex and unwieldy.

If Magic created the model for the CCG L5R took that model to the next level. 

Instead of simple colors this game has several very distinct clans you can choose to play. Each clan feels very different and has definite strengths and weaknesses. Most players will gravitate to one or two clans and play them most of the time. I tend to enjoy Scorpion more than anything, but I will dabble with Mantis and Spider clan occasionally. Most of the other clans baffle me to the point of being useless. I love that.

There is also a real story behind the game instead of one that's been cobbled together and introduced long after the fact. Storyline tournaments allow the players to affect the setting and each set moves the story along a little further. Sometimes in irritating ways (I got tired of my beloved scorpion being banished repeatedly).

Combat is also much more tactical than my monster smashes yours. Each player has a number of 'provinces' that you may attack in any way you wish. You can muster allies and attack them all at once or overwhelm one or two. Trying to determine how to best place attackers and defenders is a huge improvement (in my opinion) over the rather simplistic combat of most CCGs.

Add in the ability to duel, enlightenment victories, honor wins/loses and the other various methods to win and/or eliminate other players that have been introduced over the years you come out with something that should be to complicated to be enjoyable. Should be, but it isn't. Everything flows together and works beautifully without ever feeling clunky or overwhelming.

There are so many options and paths to victory that anyone should be able to find some aspect of this game that appeals to them. There is a bit of a learning curve, but I can promise you that most of you will find it worth the effort.

Weird balance and an overall gameplay that doesn't terribly lend itself to competitive play (compared to Magic or the late Vs. System), but for whatever reason, I really got drawn into this game. Community is very passionate and supported by a small, engaged publisher with a lot of interesting ways of keeping the fans engaged and involved. The older card design is a classic example of bulky frames interfering with art. The new card design is possibly one of the best in modern CCGs. A pleasant CCG.

Diamond Edition plus one expansion make this a great game.  But with each new set comes the inevitible power inflation of a badly designed game.  Expansions should have new mechanics and possibilities for combos, not just make characters go up to 15/15.

The only CCG I ever stuck with. It does have a high barrier to bringing a new player in, but you can generally find existing players. Of all the editions, I prefer Gold but Diamond is a close second. 

The basic strategies are appealing, the tactical feel is quite nice. The factions/specialization of the "Clans" provides a good start point for deck archetypes. I have a LOT of good memories playing this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My second favorite CCG after Magic. I love the multiple victory conditions, and they even pulled off the inclusion of additional victory conditions that are generated by individual cards, which is something that Magic never did very well. The mechanics are also very consistent with the flavor of the setting, and the clans are organized around a nice mix of flavor and mechanics. However, sometimes the degree to which a clan is associated with a specific theme or idea actually harms the usefulness of individual cards or strategies. 

Take the Crab Clan for instance: they are great at defending. That's their thing. Their strongholds boosts defense, they have access to strong, defense related action cards and other resources, and the Yu ability really evokes the idea of a samurai taking the enemy down with him as he falls in battle. However, defense cannot win games by itself. As such, the offense-oriented clans almost always have the advantage, or at least have a more dependable strategy. Conversely, the Unicorns aren't good for much other than calvary. (this is all based on older editions of the game; they may gave changed this).

That being said, I love the integration of honor into the game as a mechanic, as well as the character traits such as samurai or shadowlands. Even something like "tattooed" was made into a game ability through the addition of new cards as the game progressed. The "Fu Rule" as they used to call it allowed for a lot of interesting card interactions, and added a lot of depth to the game as more and more cards were added to the pool. It was sort of like a built into game-correction rule, and the game was generally designed with a conservative bent, so there was little power creep. At least until after the original story arch finished; then everything went crazy. 

Some of the mechanics remained arbitrary or poorly defined. I never liked the idea of being able to pay less gold for an in-clan personality and sacrificing the honor gain. The elemental rings were nearly impossible to play for the longest time, and as far as I know they never got that part of the game right. It was either too hard or too easy. Although I can boast to winning an elemental victory with the original monk stronghold once at a tournament (against Junzo's army I think). 

I also loved the idea of the storyline tournaments. I never played Magic competitively, but I played my fair share of tournament level L5R. In fact, I have the honor of placing both first and last place at storyline tournaments (playing Scorpion dishonor when I was the victor, and Ninja milling when I scrubbed out). I suspect most of the impact made on the ongoing story by these events was relatively limited, but it was still a lot of fun to get caught up in the spectacle of things.

Yes, it is a CCG and it was sold and bought and the flavor of the game changed over time.  I started playing with the initial sets pre WotC when the game actually had character.  What captivated me from the start was the wonderful mythological environment, detailed stories, art, and unique factions.  Unlike games like MTG this one actually has real character to the factions that make the game feel more like a RPG contained within a card game.  You deploy your characters, arm and educate them and they win duels, lead your armies to battle, cast spells , and change the fate of the empire! 

In terms of gameplay,  there are a number of interesting elements, multiple victory conditions, two different decks and potential for evolving strategies during gameplay.  The deck building process was always fun and intriguing.  There is more depth here than you find with most CCGs.

I am very interested to see where FFG takes the game, especially as an LCG which is more akin to the roots of the game (IMHO).

Wizards of the Coast bought Legend of the Five Rings ('L5R') from Alderac Entertainment, making it its #2 CCG to Magic: the Gathering. L5R's greatest strength is its theme, which ended up as the default setting for the Oriental Adventures expansion of WOTC's D&D RPG.

Magic is more accessible and at times more elegant, but L5R offers a level of tactical interaction that it simply can't match.  An amazing card game to be sure.

For awhile this was my #1 game. As a CCG I never felt the need to go out and get expensive booster packs so this game never drained my wallet like I thought it would.  I really love the multiplayer aspect of this game.  It works very well with more than 2, which is rare I think with CCG's. Plus the theme is right up my alley.  I also like that it's possible to win without ever going to war with someone.

OK CCG, but the "all or nothing" battle resolution SUCKS.  Hard to score come-from-behind wins after a devastating miscalculation.  If you're even one point off, you can lose your entire army.  Ridiculous.

I collected this long ago, and recently played a buddy's copy of the game.
And man, it did not age well in my opinion. It seemed like once one of us won a decently large battle, that was it. All units dead, nothing to stop total destruction, game over man.
I feel like Warhammer: Invasion borrowed good elements of this game and improved upon them.  I still like the samurai theme, but better CCG's and LCG's have passed this game by.

The only CCG I've ever played. Sucked in by my wife with an Imperial Lion starter she gave me as a gift (how she regrets that) and still a devoted fanboy 15 years down the track. I even played the RPG and miniatures game, Clan War. I'm not big on the idea of CCG's in principle and don't know how this compares to others but L5R has been a wonderful ride. Great story, great community, great friendships, great game.

Edit 27.1.18: Game now retired and I've disposed of my many thousands of cards, save a few Lion decks for nostalgia. I took a distant interest in the FFG reboot but it doesn't look anything like the game I loved, and I've moved on. I have fond memories, though, and most importantly have retained strong friendships with players I met through L5R that have endured long after the last Dynasty card was flipped.

This really was one of the best CCGs out there.  Gold Edition hurt it, although it brought in a lot of new players.  I played scorpion and had a blast doing it.  My deck was incredible in 2 player, but sucked horribly in multiplayer.  Even though I could never win multiplayer, I could usually ally with someone else and ensure they won.  This was one of the most elegantly designed CCGs ever with a storyline unparalled in gaming.  Not unparalleled in ccgs, unparalleled in gaming!  It was truly fantastic.  Still, this fell victim to the same problems as so many other CCGs.  They nuked tons of the old cards, alienating customers, the rules became increasingly more complex, alienating any potential new players, and worst of all, they killed the storyline, which was the best thing about this game.  I still have my signed Bayushi Kachiko somewhere.

I started with the first expansion (Shadowlands) and played til right before Samurai edition. GREAT game. Best played (at the time) in a large multiplayer setting. Very nuanced gameplay, and lots of different strategies. My own username is based on this game. LOVE this game.

I stopped playing at Samurai edition because they started "repricing" all the base cards, and I had no desire to get into that as I knew it would make it more a 2-player-only sort of tournament game and not the great, great game I'd come to love and enjoy.

Also, the storyline up til Spirit Wars was completely epic, and reading the little Heralds that came out (i.e. clan specific fan magazines) was simply great. An experience I will never forget!

One of the most beautiful, complex & exciting CCGs out there today.  & one of the ONLY CCGs to survive the monster popularity of MtG (thank God!).  It is a game one must truly experience if they are a fan of CCGs.  The Dynasty/Fate Decks constructions are complicated, yet flexible & the 3 paths to victory (Honor, 1st player w/ Five Rings in play & Military) make the game even more exciting & strategic.  If you are a board gamer at heart & don't care for CCGs, you MUST give this game a chance because it will appeal to you.  I've played this game only 4 times & yet I'm a fan.  I love this game & will continue to buy decks & boosters whenever I have the extra cash in my pocket.

The only CCG I have ever played "seriously", mainly due to the oriental feeling, secondly due to it's mechanisms, in third place there's a great atmosphere it tournaments and, finally, it's cheaper than others, as it hasn't extended that much.

Building decks for this one is hard, as the game is played with two decks and, as you draw cards from both, you need to build them in a way they have good synergies in between them. 

The power curve of the cards was raising too much when I left it (early Samurai arc), not sure how it is now. If you don't want to enter the tournament scene, I'd say the best arcs are Gold and Diamond editions, with their respective "expansions". You should be able to find cheap decks belonging to those on Ebay and such.

From a play perspective this game is very good. Two decks to play simultaneously, interesting variations on the cards, several factions each with its own flavor, very tactical battles...I could go on. Problem with the game is in the power of the rare cards. Sneak Attack, for example, is a must have for a tournament level deck. Problem is, you can buy a whole case of boosters and get one. This publisher is a stand-out in producing CCG's with this financially draining card distribution, and I find it pretty insulting. Alderac is down there with Games Workshop as publishers that abuse their customers. Game would rate higher, otherwise.

After most of the people I knew lost interest in Magic and the White Wolf CCGs, this was the game they picked up.  And kept playing it up until now.  I think I played it just once.  Seemed fun, but I had no intention of getting back into CCGs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of the few CCGs I still play with any regularity (the other two being Mythos and Netrunner).  It can be long with too many people, but a great 3-player quasi-wargame to kill a few hours.

RATING: 4
I got into L5R enough to know that it didn't hold a candle to Jyhad/V:TES or M:TG for me. Then I got out of CCGs more or less entirely, so I don't know if later expansions improved/changed the game.

The honor aspect and the strengths and weaknesses of the different clans were pretty cool, as was the theme. But the game itself just wasn't interesting enough to keep me buying cards.

Decent CCG - only played the old version.  Kind of put off by the removal of basically all of my cards from play.  Storyline at times seems more like a soap opera.

This is one of the best CCGs on the market.  I stopped collecting it after Pearl Edition, as I felt I had enough cards to build hundreds of different decks at that point.  The game play is solid and gives you multiple ways to win, albeit some easier than others. The theme is fantastic, and the art work is normally better than average.  I used to play this regularly and participated in several tournaments (the only CCG I ever did this with) before I had kids.  Now I build decks and look forward to the day my children are old enough to play it with me!

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

This is a brilliant CCG and my favorite "combat/conquest" CCG.  The only reason it's not a ten is that I just can't keep up with the different editions financially.  It's a wonderfully constructed, exotic, evocative, well-honed game.  PM me if you have any questions.

With the new Samurai Edition, this game moves up to my #2 All Time Top 10.  They really have simplified down to the essence of why this is an amazing game with the new rule set!!  I lived in Japan for over 10 years (speak, read and write Japanese) so just love the theme...great mechanics and very challenging to win...I have many mentors (nationally ranked players), but love the challenge of deck building!!  Used to play pretty much every Thursday night at our local game store...then board games afterwards!!  The only downside is you have to own many cards and therefore spend lots of money to be competitive and the experienced players almost always win...the sign of a good game, but frustrating as you're learning
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I bought a few starters (the Lotus Edition, my FLGS is practically giving them away now that they're getting a bit dated) to see if they could rekindle the old CCG spark. My wife and I had a lot of fun with a number of CCGs in the past, but that was years ago. Let's hope the old rivalries emerge - looking good so far...

RATING: 9
A perennial favourite of post-Magic CCG design, with multiple decks, victory conditions and strategy options seamlessly interweaving in a magnificent title. As with all CCGs it would inevitably collapse under the weight of the commercial model, the ruthless competitive scene, card legality and the inevitable power creep, but the fact that it took 20 years to do so is a testament to the solid design, incredibly involved theme and excellent gameplay it always offered all the way up to the bitter end.

RATING: 6
Loved the Clan Wars story-arc of this game, but I quit the game before the end of the Hidden Emperor story-arc. 

As with all early CCGs, L5R was a very unbalanced game during the Clan Wars story arc. Although victory could be achieved through a variety of means, most factions had only one method possible if they were to achieve victory in tournament play. Some clans, (Monk and Mantis) had no hope! Plus, there were a few truly overpowered Event cards that crippled some clans.

The artwork of Matthew D. Wilson, William O'Connor, Brian Snoddy, and Randy Gallegos was excellent and elevated the game, but everyone else's was bad-to-terrible.

Like all CCGs L5R is a money-sink, but it has the friendliest player communities of any I've encountered. Tournaments were a blast! The way championship results affected the game's ongoing story is unique among games.

With all the talk of the strategic elements of this game, I find it not much more strategic than your average high-quality CCG.  Much too much (e.g. duels) is dependent on luck and hand contents.  On the plus side, I really enjoy the storytelling elements as well as the deep universe that lies behind it all.

The best collectible card game, ever (too bad Ivory edition KILLED IT!). Great community, storyline and incredibly complex gameplay that offers you four distinct ways to win, through the strength of your army, by getting the five elemental rings into play (thus obtaining spiritual enlightenment), by honouring your clan and taking your place on the imperial council or by dishonouring your opponent and bringing shame to his family. Terribly underrated here at BGG, should be top 100.

Lots of good ideas in this game, but there are too many factions with too many different victory conditions for the game designers to properly balance. Through Diamond arc to Samurai Arc, they never got the balance right. Card errata was only issued after a broken combo wins a major story tournament, which is too late to stop it from warping the entire environment.

Rokugan is one of the greatest fictional settings that I've encountered, but L5R ultimately disappointed me as a player. The small minimum deck size made this the ultimate deck designer's game, and I am not a great deck builder but more of a tactical player. Alderac eventually made a better game with similar rules, Legend of the Burning Sands, but utterly failed to support it.

Not bad for a CCG.  Based on one play, I'm finding it a bit dense, though I understand there's a strong learning curve on this one.  It's not bad, and I'm sure I'll end up playing it from time to time, but I just think it's sort of okay.

RATING: 7
Fairly standard CCG gameplay. L5R makes itself stand out by having a much richer rules engine, a greater focus on combat and player interaction. If you're sick of just swinging for two damage year after year, L5R gives a deeper and more epic game. 

L5R has a host of problems too. Deck construction is fairly rigid (it's a clan vs clan game, unlike very freeform games like VS or MtG). Due to this, there are more balance issues than usual (clans with bad selections simply become unsalvagable). Some mechanics, like duelling and honor loss, never found the balance between being overpowered and useless. More than any other CCG, metagaming becomes a much bigger deal, with silver bullets all over. Finally, the rulebook gets significant changes every time a new base edition is released, making it hard to get back into the game.

Having said all that, I love the theme and setting of this game! It's always tempting (although rarely wise) to return to Rokugan.

RATING: 5
The only problems are 1) it is a CCG (which I refuse to buy more of) and 2) while there are players around, they are still a bit of a drive and require everyone's schedules working (not L5Rs fault). Another little quibble, but all games suffer from this (but exanding card games moreso, both CCG and LCG) is that coming to the party later tends to hamper competitive ability (at least as your knowledge of the card base builds to everyone else's). Maybe War of Honor will fix some of this if I can find someone to try it with.

One of the more popular CCG's of the 90's. L5R is still going strong after 15 years with its continuing story arc that has seen heroes and their descendants battle the forces of evil in its pseudo-Japanese setting. Players can join special tournaments that affect the ever changing story arc written by its dedicated design team. A major flaw of the game is that after an hour of tournament play games can end in a stalemate with the winner decided by a coin flip.

The nonsensical Japanese is at times hard to bear. But the worst about L5R: When two armies clash, the loser loses all of his cards. It comes down to a single digit of strength, and you lose everything. It is also easy to make a small calculation error and be hors de combat because of it. There are CCGs with much better gameplay.

Some rule changes have added and taken away from aspects of the game over the last decade that I've played, but this is still one of the best CCGs I've ever played, and by far the most successful in the long run among games that try to allow greater depth of strategy.

A truly interesting theme, world, and society; great artwork, and gameplay that you can really dig into. Fairly easy to learn, while allowing the player to plan with chess-like precision to find their way to victory.

RATING: 6.9
Wonderful intellectual property.  The Rokugan setting is my choice for best RPG setting ever created.

The game started off as slow and cumbersome.  As sets were released, the game sped up and found it's niche.  300 player Banzai's were common at GenCon.  

After the various sales, L5R continued, but with each passing set, the cards became more and more complicated.  Players who didn't like military or honor-running were pushed out of the game completely due to rules changes.

The focus on more recent cards along with many older players stopping has left older cards with little to no value.

Kind of a nostalgia rating. I played a long time ago, and don't really know anyone who still does, haven't bought anything recently etc. It is a great game though. If you want to chuck money at a collectible game, this would be the one.  But, you know, my friends aren't going spend money on collectibles, so I just buy boardgames I can play with a bunch of people.

Incidentally, my user name comes from this game: Toku, the 0/1 samurai that comes out for free :) he eventually gets fairly cool experienced versions

RATING: 7
A very well designed game and the one CCG I really got into.  I enjoyed the original expansion arc immensely.  Then they continued it...

Like most CCGs, this game suffers from having no format that I can play and enjoy.  So, this rating is just nostalgia and thanks for several hundred hours of past enjoyment.

Okay, I lied... I'll always turn down a game because I don't want to get sucked in again.  The only reason I don't give this a 10 is that it is a CCG and I have given those up (I get my ten year patch next week).

Forgive me as I use Magic lingo here. 

Imagine a game where almost all the creatures have the following ability;

0: Do something, use this only once per turn and only during combat. 

Now imagine both you and your opponent have multiple creatures in combat. How do you know which abilities have been used? How long are you willing to sit there and stare at the board trying to work out if one particular ability needs to be used first to neutralise another ability? Does that sound fun to you? Cause it sure doesn't sound like fun to me.

If only the "Japanese" didn't make me cringe to Yomi and back... Worse even than Shadowrun which starting with 3rd edition made vast strides in reducing its legacy vocabulary of exoticist nonsense, to boot. They didn't retcon any unbelievable names, but at least they made such characters disappear into the setting's now-backstory.

RATING: 7
This is one complex card game. Typically CCGs are built around a very simple framework of mechanics, with the cards themselves adding most of the rules text. This is NOT the case in L5R. A vast amount of the game's mechanics are rulebook based, resulting in a very steep learning curve. The game has rules for honor and dishonor, deuling, seppuku, and Imperial favor, all of which are not addressed on the cards. The game text that is printed on the cards can be extremely convoluted, and as my oft quoted friend Zxqueb says "I swear these cards are written in a foreign language!". Once you finally get a handle on what is happening though, the game is excellent. Unfortunately, getting to that point can be a fruitless endeavor, especially for a casual player. 

Personally, I have always been enamored with the world of Rokugan, and every once in a while I visit the AEG website to catch up on the latest news in the game. I read about how my favorite faction (Scorpion) is doing or what scheme the evil Daigotsu is up to now. Unfortunately, actually playing the game is just too much work. It's hard to teach, hard to build decks for, and almost impossible to play casually. New cards are too expensive for casual play, and the game's rules change so often that old cards are barely compatible with newer ones. All in all, it's just easier to admire this one from afar.

Another CCG that i loved very much and was very good at it during the first era of the game. I even earn my Katana with all the tourneys i've won. Again like Magic, i was too obsess with the game for the time i played from 1997 to 1999. Still have a few cards left as a souvenir, from the pre-imperial, imperial ed. & first few expansions with all the promos of that era also.

I'm proud to have an Imperial Inheritance signed by KC Lancaster (somewhere in 98-99) to go with my MTG Black lotus in my hall of fame of souvenirs.

Long live the Crane which i honored the best that i could!

Good game, and quite thematic. I like the different clans and their tendency toward specialization, but at the same time it greatly reduces variety (unless you have a freaking enormous cardset). Also, too much deckbuilding at the expense of in-game decisions (that is, it plays itself too often). A game you really have to get into, and that is difficult to approach more casually.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
My favourite ever CCG. I have gone off the boil on it since my life drifted away from the group who I used to play it with, but it can still get my heart going. 

Edit - got back into this (Celestial Edition). Still great, still painfully expensive!

I have been playing this game on and off since the mid-90s and boy has it evolved. Long gone are the times of crappy illustrations. The modern version of this game is beautiful and streamlined enough to make it accessible to new players. Creating balanced decks and playing the game however requires a great deal of comittment which my wife (as my primary gaming partner) is not willing to invest and so I hardly have the chance to play this game.
But I always come back to it. Why? I guess it is the story that draws me in - great pieces of short fiction about Samurai, Ninjas, Honour and Duty and the constantly progressing story arcs of Rokugan. And it is the most beautiful card game I know - the artwork for this game is exceptional. Well done AEG, well done indeed.

Likely my favorite TCG - I just rarely get to play it anymore. Since I've moved to Memphis there are much fewer players here and with the level of complexity in the game (and deckbuilding especially)I just don't have the time.

If you like confrontation and incredibly tight play where a topdeck isn't going to save you from poor early decisions, give L5R a shot.

Another CCG I played and enjoyed back in the day. I got out around the time they started the 'Rolling Thunder' release schedule. Probably the best CCG at integrating a story with the game itself; Magic doesn't come close, and I found Magic's Japanese-themed block laughable compared to this.

Pretty darn complex game.
Huge amounts of text, but it has something that keeps me going back. At this time it's pretty clear at turn 4-5 who's gonna win. Even though combat is tricky.
I'm still not at the level of reading the cards of my opponent. Reading my own is hard enough ;p.

I gave this game a chance. Bloated, unintuitive rules poorly set out in tiny rulebooks marred the learning experience. Flavour keywords do not help when learning the game. Poor proofreading on cards and in the rulebook made the whole package feel sloppy. Despite its foibles the game is interesting and inspires my curiosity. If the game had a greater online presence with an active youtube community to help me learn and understand it might have pulled me in but as it stands I can't see myself playing this.

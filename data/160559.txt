This is a fun game with a cool theme and stunning art. However, the board is waaaay too busy, and it can be hard to scan the board and find what you want to do. You also have to take a magnifying glass to the scoring cards in order to determine which dragon is which - many of the dragons look quite similar.  And why couldn't they have made the resources a consistent size? Basically nothing fits in the provided squares on the personal player boards. Too many clunky features that should have been easy fixes. I did enjoy the game quite a bit, and I see lots of potential for some strategic depth. But this game has no business being as clunky as it is.

Looks pretty at the beginning, but is mostly a worker placement resource wrangler with distracting and confusing graphics. At least the "short version" (played in Essen 2015) feels boring in terms of lacking interaction - action spaces are limited, but usually can be occopied by 4 players at the same time. I also see runaway leader issues, though this might be intentional.

Too light to be challenging, too heavy to be just fun for 30 min.

Nem terveztük hogy játszunk vele, csak úgy szembejött. 5 fős parti alapján nagyon kellemes meglepetés, rég láttam ilyen eredeti worker placement játékot. A különböző típusú munkások (gyalogos, sárlánylovas) jól el vannak találva, az akciólapkák dinamikus változása szuper. Lehet hogy egy akciólapka 1 körön át lesz csak kint, de lehet hogy végig a játékban lesz. A két végefeltétel időbelisége is nagyon egyedi, akár nagyon hamar is vége lehet, akár nagyon hosszú is lehet, de az utolsó körök mindenképp nagyon izgalmasnak tűnnek. Más játékokban zavar, ha váratlanul vége lehet, de itt kifejezetten tetszik ez a fajta dráma. Vajon ki fogja befejezni? 1 kör van hátra, vagy 5?... Elég sajátos az egész játék hangulata, tök egyedi az egész, nagyon jól össze van pakolva. Nem tudom a lapkák mennyire kiegyensúlyozottak, volt azért köztük elég durva. A sárkányok nagyon jó kombózási lehetőséget hoznak be, de az is kifizetődő lehet, ha nem használjuk őket.
A sok pozitívum után jöjjön egy nagy negatívum is, ami miatt 1 ponttal rontottam a pontszámon: szép ugyan a grafika, de mégis ezer sebből vérzik, mert nagyon nem gyakorlatias a megvalósítás. Bizonyos fontos elemek nem jól látszanak, azok az akciók töltik ki a tábla felét, amiket alig választunk a játék során, a sárkányok beazonosítása macerás, stb. Mintha a grafikai részre nem maradt volna idő, pedig ha erre is odafigyeltek volna, akár kiugrónak is nevezném, mert amúgy tök jól működik a játék, de sajnos az összképhez ez is hozzátartozik. Mindenképp próbálja ki mindenki, aki szereti a némileg tematikus eurogémeket, vagy aki kicsit újszerű worker placement megközelítést akar látni.

It's a really fun game to play with just small amount of down time and theme is really catch me up. It's the components that brought down the experience for me. The resource tokens are a bit boring compare to the big theme it has, some of them don't even fit in the player board. The dragon depiction on the objective tiles are small that you have to look it carefully in order not to make any mistake.

I like a good euro. But this one is boring and overly complicated for what it brings. You could win by rushing to the end or by building the better engine but which way the game is going is subject to the other players. It has a number of interesting twists to known mechanics, but overall it feels very reminiscent to many other worker placement/resource conversion euros.

Not special enough to claim it's space in the board game universe as far as I'm concerned. The artwork is beautiful though. Thick cardboard, intricate worker components and nice wooden custom resources add to the quality feel too. Too bad it's only superficial.

The graphic design in this game SUCKS.  White back slashes on beige backgrounds are impossible to see.  And white numbers on a background of white clouds?  Seriously?  And it is really hard to differentiate dragons on the tiny tiles.  I have seen people make game-losing decisions because they couldn't tell the difference between the dragons.

The game could be great, but the terrible graphics make it so much of a chore to play that I probably won't bother with it again.

Beautifully produced worker placement/ resource conversion game.  The action spaces are much more dynamic than usual, being put into play as the the players choose.  However, it is still basically a convert resources to points engine.  I would guess I'd rate this about a 7, but can't be sure until I play it.

Wife's Rating: 9

EDIT: 2 more plays later and it's much like I surmised, much more enjoyable once you have some games under your belt and know how to play well. Increased rating to 7.5 - would be 8, but hard to suggest this to others - the first game or so is really rough. (Wife originally gave it a 6 after 1 play, after another 3 plays, gives it an 8.)

For those interested, the expansion didn't really change the game too much, more of the same kind of feel - even with the huge extra board. I did enjoy the cards that gave benefits for recalling all troops - that sped up the game a little. The other expansions are more of a take it or leave it thing. Doesn't really hurt or help the gameplay much either way. That being said, it does provide a different feel each time you play.

Original rating: 7

Initial rating based on 2 plays - might change with subsequent plays/expansions

Fun little worker placement game that despite its art, is really just a dry euro point salad - that being said, I enjoy my euros :-)

The board building aspect lends some tactical analysis to the game play rather than strategic - due to the modular and transient nature of the mechanics, it's hard to formulate a long term plan. The game is played and won on who can plan the best in the current to perhaps next round before the board is once again changed or discarded. Players need to understand this in order to have a good time - it's not about planning any elaborate move that will score you bundles at one time, but more about grabbing any available point that you can while you can.

I do wish it was easier for beginners to play well, but due to the inherent nature of the game, the first half of the game will be lost on the newbie until they figure out how the game works - which is what happened with my wife: totally lost until she started chaining free moves off the dragons like a champ in the latter half of the game. 

While the game is quite light, I can't imagine myself teaching a bunch of new players to play all at once and expect them all to enjoy it - especially if they aren't regular gamers. I 'could' see them enjoying it on subsequent plays however, but it's due to this that I can't give it a higher initial rating.

I do have some complaints about the components however, but they didn't factor into my rating:
-Acrylic is quite pretty, but fragile - I worry that a drop would chip the spears off of the vassals
-The different components of the resources is just strange, either have it all cardboard, all wooden blocks, or all wooden shaped, a mixture of all three makes it aesthetically displeasing.
-The dragons, and modular boards, and objectives tiles could all have easily been cardstock instead of cardboard - they're so thick and unwieldy to shuffle as needed for setup.
-Dry euro, dragons don't actually do anything draconic. You can't fly on them, or use them to destroy things, they just sit around looking pretty.

Overall the game plays rather quick, some slight AP can be had depending on the player, but as there aren't any long reaching effects of your choices, it's mild. Can't wait to play it with the expansions to see how it changes the game.

RATING: 4
I guess it mainly comes down to, no one in our group actually enjoyed playing this game. The game is a mess. If you don't enjoy balanced, strategy games, this might be for you.

Very pretty, but so cluttered the art just gets distracted into looking like someone vomited on the board. The plastic pieces might look good at first but they distract from the game to me. 

I like the idea of placing out the main action spaces. If the game play was smoother, more balanced or predictable, the game might be fun. No one enjoyed playing this game.

The game is incredibly chaotic and not particularly balanced. A large part of that is the uneven feel of the pacing of the game. The action spaces are pretty horribly conceived as well. It appears that balancing wasn't really what they were going for, and that might be ok, in most worker placement games, but this one doesn't always let other people abuse the more broken spots. 

The game is very swingy. You can easily get a quarter of your points on accident from having a single ability on your only dragon. It is very very easy for a quarter of the game to be exhausted played in a single players turn. This makes it very difficult to determine when or how the game will end.

Been after this one for a while as I do like me a dragon theme

This one is a really interesting one, as none of us really enjoyed the first play of it, but all of us immediately saw things they would do in future games to make the experience better.

Resource generation on the main board is very very limited thus you have to pay very close attention to the cards that go to the wilds, otherwise you can end up resource poor and a bit stuck in gameplay terms.

I like the whole empty cards in the wilds go to the chronicles and there is certainly a rush strategy whereby you attempt to fill the chronicles, thus ending the game before other players are ready, and this also adds a layer of depth to the vessel recall portions of the turn as you CAN choose to have some remain on the board thus ensuring that the card does not fall off into the chronicles.

I am a bit dissappointed that the resources are bigger than the squares on the player boards designed to accomodate them, and the spaces which allow 4ppl to take that action seems a little pointless as we barely had enough workers between us to have to actually compete for the spaces.  The board is also very busy and difficult to look at, however once you get playing the symbology is actually very clear.

I like that only dragon riders can do certain actions, but feel there should have been some that only the spearman could do.  We also found that the exploration tiles seem much more powerful and provide many more points that all the other tiles put together.

I am not sure I really like the look at 3 cards, choose one put the others top or bottom mechanic, especially with the dragon objective tiles, I felt like this mechanic gave one player pretty much a monopoly on which dragons were worth points at the end, if they all went to the bottom that might be better.

Awkward game components with crappy cardboard quality, paste-on theme, overly busy (but beautiful) game board, lacking in interesting game mechanics.

I did like how the dragons allowed you to create powerful combo's and that you can play a short and a long version of the game. But all in all the game didn't really manage to grab my attention after one play. Will give it another try though.

Nice worker placement game with a cool Fantasy theme that is not a total waste only because of the beautiful artwork, as almost everything feels very abstract. And it seems that someone forgot to tell the cover artist that the simurghs in the game are simply dragons, not the gigantic birds of the Persian myth.

The gameplay features the standard gathering and conversion of resources, but it has a few twists. Action spaces are always changing, as players place tiles on the board and eventually remove them (either by excess or lack of workers on them). Also, there are two kinds of workers, spearmen and dragonriders, and some action spaces are restricted to the latter. Finally, there is a kind of tile that players can "explore", paying to move a dragonrider for increasing benefits.

However, there are also some quirks. The end can be triggered in two different ways, both by the players' actions: number of action tiles removed and objectives placed. Thus, a player can very easily rush the game end, especially by buying the relatively inexpensive objective tiles. Most of these give majority bonuses for unused ability tokens on specific dragons, and they can be very unbalancing. In my last game, a player got 12 points for a single token, as no-one else had the dragons depicted on that objective tile. Such occurrences are quite frequent.

The production is really odd. The publisher spent a lot of money on thick tiles (lots of them), when cards would have been perfectly fine (and even preferable, for ease of shuffling). The player pieces, though, are cheap thin cutouts in brittle plastic (one of mine already came broken). The resources are all over the place, ranging from cardboard tokens to wooden shapes, but only the wooden cubes fit the spaces for them on the player boards.

In contrast with the quality of the art, the graphic design is terrible and really harms the game. Although the icons are mostly good, they are often too small. Also, due to the backgrounds on the dragon tiles and some similar colors, matching them to the dragons on the objective tiles can be annoyingly difficult. Another thing I dislike is that all the action tiles have the same picture and no visual distinctiveness apart from the icons, which reinforces the overall abstractness.

The rulebook is not among the worst I have seen, but it definitely could use a lot of improvement. It's particularly noticeable the absence of any rule for majority ties, which is a major part of the scoring.

This is still a good game, with potential to be more, but marred by amateurish decisions and lack of development.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: euro de gestió de recursos col·locació de treballadors (estil Tzolki'n).

Les mecániques no tenen res a veure amb el disseny gràfic, el joc és un euro mooooolt sencill amb mecàniques totalment repetides i sense cap afegit interesant. Al cap i a la fi, es tracta d'acumular recursos (hi han com 20 llocs de col·locació de treballadors que et donen diferents combinacions de recursos: una fusta i una pedra, dues fustes, una eina i una fusta, etc...) i de gastarlos després per quanyar PVs.

Simurgh looks fantastic at first glance thanks to the artwork and the components are certainly good quality. However, when you play the game you realise that some of the graphic design decisions were very poor. Certain elements impact negatively on the playability of the game, including the lack of any icons or other identifying features on the dragon and objective tiles (you have to match them based on the artwork alone, which can be quite tricky), the incredibly small font for the tile numbers, the small size of the icons denoting the type of tile, and the almost invisible white dividing line on some action spaces. 

The game itself has proven to be more interesting than I had expected from a self-declared worker placement and resource management game. The variation in available action spaces due to the coming and going of action tiles in the wilds means that you sometimes have to really hunt around for the resources you need to realise your plans. The only part of the game that doesn't work well are the objective tiles - there are so many types of dragons that finding an objective tile that suits you is just pot luck. Not to mention those minutes wasted in trying to match up the illustrations on the objective tiles to those on the dragon tiles!

All in all, I think this could have been a very good game if as much time and effort had been spent in playtesting and development as was devoted to the artwork.

Each game is a puzzle to solve-- instant buy after one play at a convention. Really love this once and it is beautiful. Easy to teach but yet so much going on . . . in a good way. Lots to think about without it being overwhelming.  My only worry is that luck may play a stronger role than I typically prefer with regard to dragon powers and starting power tiles, however I have not confirmed this and all the games I've played so far have actually been pretty balanced.

2016-07-11 - We played this one time at Dice Tower Con, and I think there were a couple of expansions thrown in, but nothing too complicated. I really like the art. I wish the little guys were wood instead of acrylic, but they look pretty good, too. There's a lot of random to this game, which makes any kind of strategic planning virtually impossible. Once you embrace it as a tactical worker placement game, I think it becomes much more enjoyable. I need to play it more, though, to really make up my mind.

RATING: 5.5
Doesn't it look beautiful? Yep, but: [i]Simurgh[/i] doesn't [i]worgh[/i]. 

It has some serious quirky timing issues due to players collectively determining the moment the game ends. When a player is in the lead the incentive to push the game towards the end will likely result in engine building not paying off. So most of the time, players are left with a nagging feeling the game ended to quickly. 

Second, part of the thrill of a good worker placement game comes from the competition over limited space. This games lacks that tightness and some spots are hardly ever used because they are just not worthwhile.

Finally; yes the artwork is beautiful, but from a playability aspect it is lacking. The game board is overly busy. You will have a hard time matching the dragons on the their tiles and the objective tiles. Then there are slashes between resources that are printed white on light beige background and resource pieces do no fit on the sheet.

Much underrated game by far; brilliant euro-balanced game - very thematic once you start to understand how and why cards and spots are built the way they are.  The variety from game to game due to the cards that come up and the dragons that become available to you is enormous.  Only point of dissatisfaction is the player board is way to small for ample placement of your resources.  Minor issue in an otherwise amazing game. Love it!

First play with 3.  Board was way too loose to cause conflict.  Only the meat resource was scarce enough to cause any real consternation.  Some of the tiles were way over powered.  The player determined variable game end caused the game to be way to short and the leader can easily force termination.

Though the art is beautiful, it causes the board to be very busy.  And unfortunately, the dragon tiles are too similar making determination for the scoring tiles hard.

Final gripe is the components.  Its very clear the kickstarter didn't reach potential so some resources are shaped wood, others cubes, and finally the rest paper.  This makes the whole game look cheap.

This is a very pretty worker-placement type game based around castes and dragon-riding. It is fairly typical of worker-placement euros with a couple of twists. Some places are unlimited, some are not, some places are restricted to the type of worker you place, and some are not. That creates some interest for me.

More interesting is that, during the game, you can build the types of action spaces that you want to play workers on, selected from a limited draft. That can help you tailor combinations and create beneficial synergies. Each action space has a limited life, and many are cycled through during any game, but you have some control over how long they last, as do other players.

The last aspect that I enjoy is that there are global goals that can be created or changed as the game progresses. Once a certain number of them come out, the game end is triggered (along with other aspects), and they can sometimes be changed subsequently, creating an uncertainty that means you have to be paying attention or things can shift on you fairly rapidly.

I have played two and three players, and it plays differently between them. This is one game I almost like two players more than three! With two players, it is possible to effectively play your action tiles in a manner that the other player cannot utilize them - that adds yet another layer of strategy to the game because the action tiles you play are usually beneficial to other players too.

The one real cons for me is that it is sometimes difficult to differentiate dragon types and that the game is over when only 5 objectives are drawn. It can come to a close extremely rapidly, especially in a larger player count game when each player can fairly quickly get the resources for one or two objectives.

Overall, it is a very neat game, indeed.

Disclaimer: I demoed the game during Essen 2015 for the publisher, NSKN.

This is a very nice euro game with a cool twist here and there, that is one of the more flexible games I have in my collection. I can totally see it being played as a semi-casual filler game for 45-60 minutes as well as a longer, more brainy 90 minute strategy game with the right crowd. A lot of stuff about the game depends on the players - the length, the amount of strategising vs opportunism, how efficient the game flow will be...

At any rate, after I go on a Simurgh detox for a month or so I'll be very happy to introduce my friends to this game.

Worker placement and resource conversion, that's often enough to kill my interest. The cool theme made me try it anyway, and I'm glad I did.
The way the action spaces are continually changing because players bring new action tiles into the game and old ones are removed, gives this game a special dynamic and a lot of replayability.
Also, excellent artwork... and dragon meeples.
Update after a year: enthusiasm has waned a little. It's still a fine game, but not as special as I first thought. Also, some graphic design choices have been very unfortunate (i.e. bad).

UPDATE: Rules are not very clear, symbol heavy, very hard to make points in this game. It just doesn't feel like it comes together 

On loan from (XB_XB) first impressions before first play: lots of components crazy good value really ,  art is great and rules not ro bad although the 2 game modes is a little confusing, a lot of tiles that really could have been cards, plastic figures seem very tacky, hoping this games is better than the very dry and disappointing Mistfall.

A really interesting worker placement and resource management game. The board is divided into two sections, the wilds where players may place tiles down from their hand which creates worker placement spots that either generates resources or scoring opportunities. Then in the city players may spend resources to gain workers, tiles and choose end scoring opportunities.

It's not an easy game to summarize, but the mechanisms are solid and engaging and the production is absolutely gorgeous.

Found it cheap.  First play with my son in July '17. 
First of all, what a bloody terrible title.  Second, a stupid theme, really.  The game uses some poor graphical layout and poor rulebook making learning such a simple game a chore.  Plays smoothly enough, with very short turns.  There is no sense of story at all...you just get things and turn them into other things.  Maybe will try again with a third player, but probably not going to be requested by the boy.

The timing aspect of when to use the Wilderness tiles you have is crucial... the ability to stay focused on your objectives is also crucial, it's very very easy to get distracted by shiny rewards on the tiles placed by other players that can make you take a detour and that detour can be pretty significant and you might not be able to get back on your track fast enough!

I also liked that the City spaces for placing the workers aren't that exciting, the things you get there are in a very small number and if you want to get the big hauls you have to use the exploration tiles in the Wilderness... it's a very cool concept to have to Scout to get tiles... then play those tiles in the wilderness and receiving one resource by just placing the tile and then using the tile for the resources, power and/or abilities they give... and there are some very cool tiles and of different type, ones for production, others for exploration, others for research... very very interesting concept that the players put the good stuff out there and when to place it is very important because you don't want to give the good stuff to the opponents!
It's also pretty cool the way the tiles stay in the board or go away... so if a tile is ever empty it gets put in the Chronicles, the memories of the city! Depending on the number of players, when a tiles gets a number of workers on it it's considered exhausted and goes to the Chronicle and every player with workers on the tile will get them back, and this very important too because you your turn you do one of two mandatory actions, you either place a worker or you recall any number of your workers you want from the board... so if you can get workers back without having to waste an action on it it's pretty good.

We all liked the game but we all also felt it was too fast... will have to play it again with a longer setting

After one play, I need to play this game again. The rounds play very quickly when you become familiar with the possible actions.
We played the "medium" length game with 5 players and it ended in 65 minutes, which felt too short. The game progresses very quickly indeed and I like action tile placement mechanic as it means the board is ever changing.
Looking forward to my next game.
After my second game, which ended in 45 minutes with 4 players, I am really enjoying Simurgh. It is soooo fast that you have little time to get an engine going but that is the point: you need to get your VPs quickly!
With this speed of play, Simurgh is changing the WP game world and is making games like Lords of Waterdeep appear very slow and dated!
Simurgh is rapidly becoming my surprise hit of Essen '15.

I'm getting so sick and tired of these generic Euros with flashy artwork that serve only to cover up these tired, old resource conversion mechanisms. Pierluca Zizzi has some really good games, but this isn't one of them. There is absolutely nothing new here at all, and it's a shame that we're still getting these awful JASE games in 2016.

This game is over way too quickly - my last game took more time to setup than play!
There is something of an engine builder, getting extra workers and dragons and progressing along the explore bonus action but if one or two players decide they want a quick game then it will be over before anything gets going.

Wow so beautiful. SO SO SO PRETTY! I LOVE DRAGONS. I had to have it. 

Worker placement game with dragons. Perhaps the definition of a cube pushing game (with few cubes). Only played with 2p so I surmise it will be better with more players and have more tension between actions. 

I definitely enjoyed my first play. I already can see how I will play differently next game. Really excited to play this game more.

Barely a 7 for me; although everything worked, there was a little too much going on and some of it felt as though it was there to justify other things; e.g. the two different types of "workers" just felt fiddly rather than interesting, and some of the elements were there to enable the game to run long enough for engines to be built, rather than being integral parts e.g. the half-a-dozen different resource types needed to make the costs distinctive meant that there needed to be too many "quest" and "dragon" cards, leading to potential randomness.  On the other hand, this also creates a lot of design space for expansions.
Not really for me, but not a bad game by any means.

1 play - average worker placement game.  I think it tries to be the Manhattan Project ... but it fell flat with us.  The initial set up was wonky and the tiles just felt like they should've been regular cards.  We only played a short game but I don't think a longer game would've been much better (at least for me)

Sárkányos, munkáslehelyezős játék. Az euro játékra ráhúzott sárkányos téma a szép grafikai miatt kicsit átjön. Kétfajta "munkásunk" van, az egyik erősebb és vannak olyan akciók, amiket csak velük hajthatunk végre. A játék újítása a dinamikusan változó akciómezők ötlete. Minden játékos alapból kap 3 fajta akciómezőket tartalmazó lapot, amit választásuk szerint dobnak be a játékba. Ezek vagy adott számú jelölőt elérve vagy 0 jelölő esetén kerülnek ki a játékból. Nyersanyagok vannak, amikből új munkásokat, pontot és sárkányokat tudunk szerezni. Ezek a sárkányok különböző bónusz akciókat adnak, amit alapból egyszer használhatunk, de később újra föltölthetjük őket. A játék nem fix körös, hanem két végfeltétele szintén dinamikusan változó. Így a játék hossza kevésbé kalkulálható. Jól összerakott játékról van szó, negatívuma a hihetetlen rosszul megalkotott tábla és rossz jelzések, megérne egy újranyomást, illetve érdekes volt, hogy az első partinkban úgy nyert valaki, hogy tulajdonképpen nem sok mindent csinált a játékban, egyszerűen nem használta fel a bónusz akcióit, amiért a végén rengeteg pont járt, mivel más erre nem figyelt. Szóval a pontozás érdekes, főleg a játék végén nyerhető sok pont. Ettől függetlenül minden parti más lehet és a játékosszám is befolyásolhatja a parti folyását. Jó lenne vele még egy parti jobb értékeléshez, de mindenképpen tetszett elsőre.

Worker placement game with some "quest" tiles to place workers on that provide strong benefits as well as a game clock.  Iconography is overwhelming and somewhat confusing.  Components are a mixed bag:  the board is gorgeous, tokens are numerous and small, there are an immense amount of tiles that blur together under the glut of icons and the workers are cheap plastic and look awful.

This was a big impulse buy for me.  I love dragons and worker placement so it seemed like a no-brainer to at least give it a fair shake.  As I said, it is a worker placement game with dragons.  You spend your turns placing your workers on spaces to collect resources and those resources are used to score points and acquire dragon tiles which can score you more end game points based on the objective tiles played during the game.  The big thing setting this apart from many other standard worker placement games is each player has a hand of tiles that act as new action spaces they can add to the board.  This offers a huge web of decisions while you decide which actions to add for your own use while also being concerned about the benefit your opponents can gain off of your own plays.  There's a nice little risk/reward play going on in your head for each tile added to the board.

I have two main criticisms to this game.  The first is that the worker placement mechanic is very similar to games like T'zolkin and Manhattan Project where on your turn you can choose to place a worker or take your workers back.  This mechanic works well when you start with a lot of workers and/or workers are plentiful and easy to acquire which is true of both those other games.  In this game you start with two workers and they are typically very expensive to acquire.  This turns into a cycle where every couple turns you need to just retrieve your workers to play more.  This is compounded by the fact that there are progressions spaces where you need to keep a worker out to make progress for several turns as well as emptying tiles removes them from the game so you may want to keep a worker out to keep a tile around.  So in a worst case scenario you could spend every other turn playing and then retrieving the same worker until you get more.

The other problem I have with the game is the length.  They offer different game lengths based on the number of tiles removed but there is also a second end game condition based on the number of objective tiles played.  and objective tiles are incredibly easy to play, only costing 2 resources.  My first game was a short game and we got to the objective tile condition before even getting to the removed tile condition which means short, medium, or long game length wouldn't have mattered.  There's a lot of neat stuff to do but it doesn't feel like there is enough time to do much of it before the game ends.  In fact there is an area on the board where you can acquire more tiles and we never even used it in our first game, we had never even exhausted our starting hand of tiles before the game ended.  This especially represents a problem where most of the points are public and easily determined so a player in the lead can accelerate the end game with ease.  In fact adding objective tiles not only lets you choose ones you benefit most from but also gives you points for adding.  I think the game is still good, I mean I'm complaining about not getting to play more of it.  But it certainly could use an adjustment on end-game conditions.

As for the look, the art is pretty good but the board and tiles can be a bit busy.  I'm also not a fan of the laser cut plastic pieces although others love them.  It's a personal preference thing, I just prefer chunky wood.  In fact some of my plastic pieces arrived broken in the box because they are quite fragile.

Still, dragons are awesome and this is a good game.

„Simurgh”, czyli jak wytresować smoka.

Plusy:
1.	Proste zasady
2.	Grafiki
3.	Bardzo solidne wydanie
4.	Skalowalność
5.	Możliwość ustalania czasu gry i poziomu trudności
6.	Mechanika

Minusy:
1.	Klimat gdzieś ucieka
2.	Małe plansze graczy (jeśli masz egzemplarz ze wspieram.to to nie masz tego problemu)

„Simurgh” to piękny worker placement, który cieszy oko. Jest tu sporo decyzji do podjęcia, ale nie obciąża to zwojów mózgowych, co czyni tytuł stosunkowo lekkim, choć rozmach z jakim wydano „Simurgha” robi wrażenie ciężkiego suchara. Kafle modyfikują plansze, więc każda rozgrywka jest trochę inna. Wszystko ładnie, pięknie, ale coś jest nie tak z klimatem, mimo iż gra wygląda pięknie, mechanika jest super, to pojawia się problem z klimatem który nie porywa. Nie wiem czy to przez pionki, które jakoś mi nie pasują, są ok ale nie trzymają poziomu pozostałych elementów, a może to przez to, że… nie wiem. Gra jest bardzo dobra, polecam 7/10 (z dodatkami +2)

Overly busy artwork. Convoluted mechanisms. The process is basically worker placement and multi-step resource conversion, with a bloated smorgasbord of choices and not much competition for placement locations. However, a key part of your conversion chain may disappear permanently simply because an opponent recovers his worker. Strange in many respects and not close to any of my style preferences.

Normally I would rate this a 6 - it is basically a perfectly decent if unexceptional game about transforming stuff into other stuff.

It loses one point for the poor end game. A lot of points are scored at the end for the objective tiles, which require you to have dragon ability tokens. Therefore players in general don't want to spend their tokens if the end of the game is near. Players also score points for having few resources, which means they don't want to get caught with lots of resources (although this is admittedly less important). Unless someone is far ahead on several objective tiles this results in a drawn-out grind of an endgame where players take minimal moves in order to maintain their scores in case the game ends. 

It loses another point for the graphic design, which is really poor in a number of ways: nearly-invisible slashes between symbols in many places, the difficulty of matching dragons to objective tiles from across the board, and worst of all the way most of the symbols on the action and exploration tiles disappear into the background.

The good side is that it works and you can make it last as much as you wish. The art is of course really nice. Components are beautiful but with some problems: fragile miniatures and unshuffable thick (nice) cards.
The game itself suffers from being complicated and not very original. I feel the lack of cohesion between what you are doing and what you are getting. There are 6 or 7 resources to take in a gazillion different ways and nothing helps you remembering where and how to get them. With so many elements I need, at first during my first game, some tought organizing mechanism that helps me building a strategy.
The nicest (because probably more original) part is the fact you can easily change part of the board.
Probably better after three or fours games

A city ruled by the Dragonrider clans. Like Spinal Tap, this euro goes to 11 for that extra push by taking modular setup to new bounds. Player determined worker actions is crazy, player determined game end goals, complex scoring combinations between choosing and playing journey tiles and choosing and activating dragon powers. Add to that having to consider what combos will benefit other players. Even more decision complexity comes from a limited backpack size for carrying goods and action tiles requiring a specific worker type. There is no worker recall phase, you either waste a round or time an action with a recall bonus--I love this strategy consideration. Each game is different with lots to think on between the player determined journey tiles, activating dragon tiles, end game objectives, and not wanting to benefit the opposing dragon clans.

A very interesting worker placement game with dragons. Lots of interesting uses for your workers including spots that are constantly changing. You definitely feel a difference between the two worker types and it constantly feels like you are just short of being able to do everything you want.

In one sense Simurgh is just another worker placement game in the vein of Lords of Waterdeep.  Its minor twists include two levels of workers and worker retrieval as an action (so no round-ending mass collection).

But it's the most difficult worker placement I've tried in a long time.  Resources are hard to come by.  Sometimes you're better off NOT taking a worker back because doing so would cause a critical tile to leave play.  It's tough and interesting, and I suspect it will be best at 3 or 4 players (I've only played with 2 so far).

The art is exceptionally beautiful, particularly the dragons.  However, the art also actively impedes gameplay.  The rules are black text on dark background, which I found annoying.  White symbols and tile numbers (used to locate tiles in the glossary) disappear against light colored tile backgrounds.  A tile drawing symbol on the board lies outside the normal resource location banner and almost vanishes against the gorgeous cityscape.  Dragon types are relevant to scoring but too many colors and backgrounds get re-used, and we find ourselves squinting at tiles hoping we differentiate them properly.

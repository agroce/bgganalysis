IMHO this is better than the later (proper) implementation 'Kings & Things'. KotT is a nice, simple, fast & fun game to which extra bits (board pieces etc) were added to justify a boxed game price for K&T but only detracted from the game play.

Some neat ideas here.  I am interested in trying the variant for it next time, as smacking the player who is weak is a bit brutal in this game.

This Is great filler! the system are nice. and pretty simple to learn. but cons in the rules that sometimes a little bit tricky to learn like in the combat system. but overall, its a very good game for those who like raiding opponent's kingdom! :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D

Eh, it tries to be cute, and the artwork is actually really nice. But attacking is too hard, and there's too much die rolling. If you're looking for a zany dice-fest, you could do worse. But, I think you could also do better. Could be convinced, but don't really think I'll play this again.

RATING: 7.5
My brother and I played many times in the late 80's and had a blast. I always felt Magic: The Gathering took many aspects from this game (the lands, summoning creatures, etc). It's amazing my copy is still in as good a shape as it is. Just wish I had cut some of the pieces out a little better when I was thirteen. Recently downloaded the free version and now have better cut-outs.

Contains the pieces from my old copy of Kings & Things.

Have never played this version.

RATING: 6
I have played this a lot.  No, more than that.  More than you are thinking.  I cut my original copy out of the magazine it was first published in and played it that afternoon.  And I've always really enjoyed it - I've worked on computer versions and created a "sea" expansion for it.  Still, you've got to keep it in perspective - the person who gets lucky and draws the right army and terrain is going to walk away with it.

I played this in junior high school when I got it out of Dragon magazine.  I do not remember much about it but I have always remembered it fondly and I was sorry I got rid of it.  I would love to try it again.  Update:  I just got a copy from Nobleknightgames (unpunched) for $4.50.  Can't wait to try it again.

RATING: 7
[Wham] Incredible little chit game... I used to blackmail my older brother play against me!
  
The more I play games the more I see how much this game was a pathfinder for so many others: terrain types, monsters keyed to terrains, three initiative grades, and so on. I prefer this to it's descendent Kings & Things because of managing your little kingdom, and also it has less opportunistic attacks.

Amusing tongue-in-cheek fantasy game with a significant luck element.  Benefits from a few rules tweaks to suit your taste.  Art charms if you like the style.  If you like Snit's Revenge or Planet Busters, try this one.

Great game that makes CCGers cringe.  It's just too clear that WotC knocked this off.  The art is "classic", especially if you're an old TSR fan; of course it doesn't hold a candle next to Magic.  Yet this game is better.  Search it out on the web and get it: classic! A MUST own.

RATING: 8
Great 80s Dragon magazine game from Tom Wham, has a lot of potential and should really be tried.  It's not everyone's cup of tea, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A fantasy free-for-all with lots and lots of die rolling. It's not a game that one can take seriously or play competitively, as there is far too much luck involved. If a player wanted to be cagy he would just wait for the other players to weaken each other in battle and then move in afterward and mop up...but then of course if everyone does this then the game becomes a crashing bore. So, players must play "in the spirit of the game" and just launch themselves at each each other regardless of the consequences and chuckle afterward at the swings of fortune. It's basically the gaming equivalent of a snowball fight. 

I used to love the game back when I was thirteen, and out of nostalgia I got another copy of the Dragon magazine it came in and made a deluxe mounted set for myself. 

The one particularly wonky thing about the game is that the initiative rules can be ridiculously unfair to the defender if he has to set up first, so I cooked up a house rule to fix it. You can find it here: [article=6468385][/article]. Then I went further and started cooking up more house rules to deal with the other overwrought/random bits ([thread=791366][/thread]), but I've come to the conclusion that it's a bit of a lost cause; the game is just a big barrel of random luck and dice-rolling at heart.

As far as ratings go, I can't score it very highly because I know in my heart that it's a game I would dislike if there wasn't any nostalgia involved, and on top of that the initiative rule as written is a big strike against it. Still, though, I can enjoy playing every so often if the company and mood are right, and I'm sure the same would go for anyone who is a fan of beer & pretzel games. 

If nothing else, the little illustrations on the chits still make me chuckle.

A game which shows a lot of age. It has anyway a regressive value, so that you can go back to your youth. 
But either than that there is little left to play this game for.

An old Tom Wham game from Dragon Magazine (#77 in 1983).  Zany (as only Wham could deliver) and fun.  A fantasy-themed game where you build up your territories, structures, and forces, along with magic items and treasures and sometimes go to war on your opponents to reap the spoils of war.  It actually has shades of Magic the Gathering to it, with how certain mechanisms work, so it is possible that it had some influence on Magic, along with Cosmic Encounter.  Dunno, but I could believe it.  This is one of those old Dragon games that I will definitely still play today if someone asks for it.

RATING: 6.2
Built, and now on loan to Rick.  Our first play went pretty well.  This is a random - puss-driven game.  Our early leader was riding high, until the Black Plague killed over half of his standing army.  Suddenly he was weak, so the other three players victimized him.

We dismissed the initiative rule, as this felt broken.  Instead we diced to see who deployed a single troop first, and then swapped back and forth deploying troops.

Next time we will check out the Stamford variant.

Overall an enjoyable game, but it is good it doesn't take too long to play.

This game was way ahead of its time.  You only have to look at Eagles' "Age of Mythology" (tile placement and combat), "Puerto Rico" (tile and economics), and even "Magic the Gathering" (land determining the placement of troops), for a just a few examples of works inspired by this game and its mechanics.

As a roleplayer in my teens I bought every issue of The Dragon magazine.  I was pleased to find Tom Wham's 'King of the Tabletop' game in issue 77 (1983).  As my friends and I were into AD&D we loved this game and played it to death.  Based on the fun we had with this game I went out and bought 'Kings & Things' when it was first published (which, sadly, I have never played).

RATING: 8.75
Fun Factor: 8
Components: 8 (Components are just paper BUT they receive a bump because the artwork is spectacular!!)
Theme: 10 (This game really has its own flair.  Play it when you want something that STANDS ALONE thematically.)  
Mechanics: 8 (Nothing super special, but a few really good mechanics shine here:  Chit draw from cups, lining up for battle in various land territories, trying to get special characters to join your cause...)
Theme + Mechanics: 10 (Mechanics fit the theme wonderfully.)
Replay Value: 7
Scaling/Players: 7

Subjective: +0.25 What an excellent game.  Made even better by the fact that it was had at a pittance price.  The strategy is sometimes engaging, sometimes not, but the game is always highly entertaining and never dull.  Would play it most times over Talisman.  The combat system is simple and elegantly works.  The cup mechanic is brilliant.

Pretty cool.  Couldn't finish a two player game though.  Seems like it could run really, really long.  To be fair, it took a lot of back and forth glancing at the rules.  The prestige point system was very arithmatic-y.  Not sure if that'd be a complaint for someone who can keep numbers in their heads easily.  Oh yeah, and it was free, which I love.

I stumbled across a copy of this issue of Dragon magazine in an old bookstore years after it had been printed.  I put the game together on cardboard and have had a blast with it ever since.

Ok, I don't care about pushing cardboard and rolling lots of dice. I have beautiful color counters for this. I think it is a good game for a group of regular wargaming buddies. All that being said, I have developed plenty of house rules to improve it.

This was the old, dragon magazine version, and I played this one quite often.  I'd even play solo when other opponents weren't available.

Now, I have its successor, 'Kings and Things' and have yet to play it!  Not for lack of interest, but more due to having a collection of much greater size and not enough time.

Great Game!  When i was in middle/high school we played the crap out of it.  We actually went as far as taking ideas from Kings and Things and expanding Kott so that more than 4 people can play.  My only gripe is that combat is extremely die roll heavy, like large numbers of combatants can mean SCORES of rolls.

Game with lot of charm (I love the art of Tom Wham) and surprisingly good game mechanics.

But one thing is for sure, I really like this game.

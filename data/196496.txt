Good WWII "movie" generator. A lot of fun and a sense of adventure during the play. As a minor con, the board gets crowded sometimes and it breakes the flow a bit while you try to rearrange the cards.

Very similar to the original Warfighter. WWII weapons being less deadly than modern ones, I find winning some of these missions quite difficult. A good excuse for trying again!

This is basically a living card game, like Lord of the Rings LCG, Arkham Horror LCG and Warhammer Quest ACG, with a WWII overlay. Arkham's game play is better in both quality of narrative and in generating meaningful variation. Arkham's characters are more varied and interesting than the collection of soldiers in Warfighter. Arkham's scenarios are also more developed than the linear and mildly varied missions of Warfighter. In Warfighter, the variation is driven more by the loadouts, events, and action decks. The expansions of Warfighter are of the "more stuff" variety. But for the most part, they do not seem worth the money. They simply don't introduce enough new aspects to the game (I haven't played the Russian or Poland expansions).  Warfighter's board is barely usable once you have more than 2 hostiles at a location. The campaign mode is underdeveloped. The rule book could be much better.

It's not all bad, as there are some good aspects to the game play. The combination of planning your squad and its load out in combination with the action deck is pretty good. I especially like the action deck and the ability to cycle through the deck by expending actions. If the missions and/or campaign mode was improved, this would be a much better game. Further, if the expansions brought significant changes to the missions, soldiers and/or weapon choices, the game would be improved. Without those, we're left with a decent core of a game that's surrounded by an excessive amount of homogenous stuff.

The strategy of the game seems to boil down staying dominant over the hostile units. If you lose the advantage, you're likely to have a squad that's KIA or have a squad that runs out of time to complete the objective. Your ability to stay dominant over the hostiles is influenced by your pre-planning (squad construction and load out); your hand management; your in game movements/deployments; and the randomized elements of the game's engine (e.g., hostile draws and dice rolls). Also, as you move into higher resource missions, it seems to be much easier if you play with multiple player characters. That's not particularly fun and, for me, a further strike against the game. (If I want to solo play a card-based war game multi-handed, I could play Up Front; or if I want a solo game with easily manageable multiple hands, I could play Xenoshyft.)

For those just starting with the game, I found that the sample mission does a poor job of helping you understand what good strategy entails. In the rule book's sample, they were able to successfully suppress or kill a hostile on EVERY attack roll (with the vast majority being kills). That success rate for rolls is far from my experience (and far from what would occur statistically). It wasn't until I played around with the load outs and reconned location that I started understanding what needs to be done in this game.

In the end, I recommend the core box if people like the idea of a WWII-themed solo/co-op card game similar to FFG's living card games . I do NOT recommend the expansions.

Very disappointing components from Dan Verssen Games. Most of the art is a mish-mash of color and black-and-white period photos, some of which do not match the topic of their card. 

I have all the offerings for the original Warfighter game and while clunky at times, it is fun. But the unattractive components in this WWII version are distractingly poor.

Even worse, the expansions are poorly-labeled and incompletely described. For example, the U.S. expansion #1 is mostly U.S hostiles cards. As I have no German expansions, most of this expansion is useless to me. Would have been nice to have a hint before I bought it. 

This is the first Verssen game I can remember being thoroughly disappointed in. It has the feel of being rushed through production. Fair game system, very poor components and component mix. Not recommended.

Great game to play solo and with a group. Rules could have been more consistent/ better clarified (the sample play contradicts the rules in a few parts such as needing to roll equal to a cards cover or better than their cover value to score a hit).

A littlebit much luck dependent (a) so often an annoying series of bad dice roles can mess up a whole otherwise perfect mission, (b) the draw of the right location card decides how the game goes - but besides that very well designed and at least always really telling a story. I love the artwork (much more than the ugly special ops version) and how the game progresses from location to location. The complexity of combat is abstracted in a good way.

A perfectly enjoyable simple squad based war game. I much prefer Space Infantry for scratching this itch though, primarily because of the setting. I'm interested to see how Warfighter plays a co-op game. Despite being nothing more than different pictures the Second World War version appealed to me more than the Modern version.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very impressive warfare tactical tabletop!!  Excellent technical design and quality manufacturing.

The way the rulebook is laid out, it may seem a bit daunting the first few playthroughs. I agree with other reviewers that the rulebook needs work & since technical writing is a big part of my job, it tended to peeve me greatly.

But just relax...this game packs a bunch of action (for a board game) into an overall, very simple game once you get the rules down. It’s a consistent and well-thought out game design, though it’s complexity may be a turn-off for some.  But, not something a rulebook rewrite wouldn’t fix easily.

Despite the state of the rulebook, I’m very glad I was stubborn enough to work through it and I am enjoying myself greatly.

And that’s not where it ends either...the rules are designed as a solitaire game, however it easily integrates multiple players without needing to introduce new rules, expands to include War Campaigns instead of just playing single missions, and can incorporate Soldier career skills development mission to mission.  Then you have the expansions which add the British and Russian forces to the rumble.

I highly recommend this game for everyone who wants to try tactical board gaming and enjoys a little bit of complexity in their games or for ‘old school hex board tactical’ veterans (like myself) who appreciate good design!

The game that got me back into Warfighter, the rules updates that they brought to this, the polished difficulty and enemies. About damn near perfect. An amazing playing experience, you can SEE this game unfold in front of you, your troops laying down fire, getting hit, succeeding or failing. Plays out like a war movie.

pros:
- simple rules;
- very immersive gameplay - every mission is a great adventure;
- your decisions really matter;
- I really prefer photos on the cards instead of crappy cg graphics;
- a lot of possible tactics;

cons:
- the rulebook is not well organized and doesn't explain everything. faq really needed asap.;
- some cards seem unbalanced; 
- the plastic dividers form expansion are a joke and almost useless; 
- the minis and metal tokens are cool looking but useless in comparision to counters; 
- too expensive when it comes to content, especially the expansions.

Feels a bit like Up Front solitaire with some RPG elements. Takes some effort to get into. Some money too, because at least some of the expansions are necessary to get much variety. Requires clever use of resources, i.e., build out points, action cards, and actions to make much headway. Games take any where from 1-3 hours. Lots of die chucking.

Tough learning curve, but I really enjoy the system and I think the game delivers on it's promise:  It creates a great narrative as you try to bring your small band of soldiers through hostile territory, battling enemies and hopefully achieving the mission's objective.

Warfighter is a challenging scenario based card game where you play as a platoon of WW2 soldiers trying to complete a mission.  The game requires some character building in the beginning and is challenging  from the get go.  The decisions are tough and the enemy is not very forgiving.  I am struggling with the game so far, but nothing has made me feel like the game is just a puzzle, so I have hope.

My Review: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1780249/after-20-plays

There is an unnecessarily painful learning curve, mostly thanks to poor rules drafting.  If you can learn the game from someone who already knows how to play, then do so and spare yourself the agony.  It's actually a fairly straight-forward and simple game.  I was hoping for a bit more depth here, but it's a borderline casual game with the occasional tough decision here and there.  That's not to say that the game isn't without tension or excitement, because it certainly has lots of that and it tells a great story whenever you play it.

The luck-factor isn't nearly as great as I anticipated it would be and I never feel I have won or lost simply because I was lucky, but rather because I made good/bad decisions.

Well-suited to solitaire or small groups.  Given the level of coordination required and free-form turn structure, this really isn't suitable for 5-6 people and I'd be hard pressed to even suggest it for 4 players.

I bought most of the expansions, but on the whole they aren't good value and feel like Kickstarter Candy (a term meaning apparent value being provided, but very little game play value therein - i.e. a marketing device).  Just a product for the sake of being a product to encourage you to fund the Kickstarter.  I don't value having more cards, I value more cards that actually make the game better.   It's easy to make more cards, but it takes time and development cost to produce the latter.

Would have liked to seen some pre-constructed missions or campaign, rather than being given a whole bunch of stuff and just left to it. 

The game is actually a lot simpler than the rulebook would have you believe, but I'm just not sure whether the random sandbox missions are particularly satisfying to play. 

Will give it a few more tries...

Just got this today through Kickstarter. There is a bunch of stuff in this box and here is the kicker, I didn't even order all the add-ons! I enjoyed the original Warfighter but this one looks even cooler. After reading the rulebook, I'm not sure I understand what is going on. I played the original Warfighter but the rules to this one appear more opaque than the original game.

Two ratings for a game that just came out. One rating is a ten and the other is a one. Typical.

God awful card layout, a lazy rulebook that doesnt focus much on teaching how turns should go, and it is missing so many keywords which is necessary to understand some of the cards. Playmat is also kind pointless.

Overall, its still a decent that gives a nice story. Choices arent as exciting due to the abstract nature but then, I do rather play predictable (focus fire on the nastiest baddie out there) and there arent enough soldier selection variability as I had hoped.

Interesting game.  Seems hard to win and quirky to understand.  The AI is tough and makes the game frustrating.  If you don't roll good, you will lose. 

I come from a grognard war gaming background and this game took a little to get to understand.  

I found the balance off.  Plus I have all the expansions and wish some of the expansions were more balanced with the German and American cards.  There are too little and too few.  It would have been cool to make the other cards as complete so you could mix up the battles between other armies better.

It just didn't thrill me that much.  I rather play a squad based board game, not a card game, or at least not this one too much.

A very good game, but it is just not as good as the original Warfighter by the same designer.  To me, the game is all about designing a loadout to match a mission.  The mission itself is just an elongated resolution to determine how well you shopped.

The WWII version is nearly identical with fewer shopping options.  It has mildly interesting stuff about weather resistance via equipment choices, but mostly it is identical.

The content is diluted over too many factions, too much of which is virtually identical -- the basic weapons for all major nations have identical stats but different names.  All that does is mean that each individual faction has less variety and fewer options.  That may be realistic, but it is not what this game is all about.  Equipping modern special forces is a much better match for the mechanics as it capitalizes on the shear variety of options for equipment and the huge range of missions that might be encountered.

Setup frustrating as there aren't enough of each weapon card to assign to all soldiers using them. Board is way too small for the number of cards used in missions. Cards don't help as much as they should - a bit more thought given to card graphics could have made setup easier. The path to objectives is very linear - OK the locations you play break the journey up but physically all you're doing is placing cards to the right of your existing card and adding to the mess of cards already on the board.

Shame as the hand management and use of different types of soldiers is a good idea that in theory could streamline the game and reduce the need for bookkeeping. And there were moments where I was challenged and the game flowed quite well. 

Ultimately though I felt like I was playing a game that required me to fiddle around with tokens for a long time during set-up (I've played phantom/hornet leader I get that set-up is part of the experience) then when the game started I had to fiddle around with cards to work out what each card's keyword was then check underneath cards to see what tokens were on what and arghhh! What a mess.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The rules have some significant holes. You will need to dig through the forums for clarifications. Some of the card text resembles shorthand notes a designer might put on a card to remind themselves what it does. The rules confusingly refer to components that only exist in expansions without any form of heads up. The board is too small in some cases. Your table may be too small in some cases. In large missions there may not be enough components. Some soldiers have to "share."

But I forgive it all. The game is just that much fun.

RATING: 7
+ Super simple tile-laying game that doesn't put me to sleep the way Carcassonne does!
- The theme is practically non-existent.


Why it's previously-owned:
I like this game quite a bit, but there's really no theme to it.  Usually when we're wanting to play a game, we're wanting something that we can become immersed in, not a chess-like abstract.
I ended up leaving this game with my relatives who are starting to get into "real" games.  I'm hoping they'll choose to play this instead of checkers and it'll lead them to want more in their games.  We have the whole GIPF series (mainly because of their ascetic value) for whenever we want an abstract game to play.

Knizia. The theme doesn't matter. A good game where you need to put titles and miniatures (points) in the right place on the right time in 3 different boards.

This game is a redesign of Kingdoms. BTW, much better.

Super-Kingdoms.  This game takes Kingdoms and expands it to 3 different boards, and adds more variety.  A fun experience that can be rewarding, but gets stale quickly when comparing it to games with more strategy.

RATING: 6
I was always curious about Auf Heller und Pfennig.  Not so much about the Kingdoms retheming.  Comments about both seemed to say it was excessively mathy, but I just preferred the former theme.  Anyway, my first experience with any of them was with this game.  After one or two moves we expected the game to be comically bad, but it quickly got better for us.  Didn't find it at all too mathy either, although I was concerned with the strength of some of the tiles - particularly the swapper, which was used to swap the also-powerful dragon.  Inoffensive and functional title for my tastes, but not enough to justify the box size or inspire a "wanna play?"

This is kingdoms, but broken.
 - first 1/3rd is kingdoms, but worse as it's more chaotic.
 - second 1/3rd is totally absolutely random, with 2 insanely strong pieces. Luck of the draw with getting those is made much much huger by the 'play 1 tile out of 3 in hand' - it allows the person lucky enough to keep the devastating tiles until the very end of round, making anything others tried to think of this round meaningless.
- third 1/3rd has none of the extremely negative tiles, and has few negative tiles at all. you are practically sure to score big points with anyghing you place. this means you feel kinda stupid if you used your scoring pawns earlier.

all in all, this might have been an extremely annoying game, but as 'kingdoms redone' it's simply broken.

RATING: 7.5
Movie tie-ins are usually bad. At least that is the received wisdom. Not so in this case, as it seems to be Dr Knizia's attempt to theme an older, solid game called "Kingdoms". In my opinion, it is just as playable and as fun but slightly more randomness than in the original. Fun twists on an older classic.

How this game even RELATES to Beowulf is beyond me.  The theme was obviously pasted onto an abstract tile laying game to sell more copies.  You would think that a Beowulf game would have something to do with the story of Beowulf.

That said, as a game, this is pretty light fare.  It can be decently strategic, but it just isn't my cup of tea.  Those looking for an exciting game based on the movie are going to be disappointed.  If you like abstract tile laying games, you'd probably love it.  It's not really for me.

A brain teaser with a fantasy theme pasted on, Beowulf is a typical Knizia game: it’s a basic optimization problem that can be solved through heavy thinking but doesn’t really appeal to me.

RATING: 6.5
Haven't played this much, but I enjoyed it. I feel like repeated plays might yield more enthusiastic results, as familiarity with the tiles will allow for more serious strategizing.
AP can be a problem here. 45 minutes seems reasonable for a game like this, but too much thinking could easily stretch the playtime to twice that.

A nice take on the Kingdoms formula.  Not too deep, but a nice simple game for when you don't want to think too much.  Also serves as a decent gateway game.

Shouldn't like this - but I do! Pasted-on theme ffor an abstract game, but the theme is nice, the bits are nice and make sense (for example the treasure tiles are either instant vps or you can put them on the board for possibly more at the end of age scoring). Mead theme is great (+ve unless you drink too much).

3 different ages/boards is nice too, and decision about when to use your more valuable bits.

Overall, like it, kids like it - wasn't expecting any of us too.

Wow, a Knizia that we enjoy - and for an ultra-discount price!  It's definitely a little mathy, but it works great for two, with a lot of take-that style play.  I like the multiple boards (about the only thing I liked about his LotR game), and the game is just the right length for what it is (maybe just a hair too long).  Great FFG components coupled with simple yet fairly deep choices makes this one a winner.

Kingdoms Deluxe.  Meh.  I like Kingdoms well enough because it is "short and sweet".  The extra chrome in Beowulf doesn't do much for me and extends the game length.  I'll play it if somebody asks, but I'm not going to suggest it.

RATING: 7
Very mathy, and no theme, but actually a decently fun game. There are difficult decisions to be made from your limited hand -- a Knizia trademark. I would NOT play this with an AP-prone player, since somebody could go through every single possible combination in their hands...urgh. UPDATE: 6 -> 7. Just had a really tense, fun game. Knowledge of the tiles (especially the special powers) is CRUCIAL -- otherwise you'll unwittingly render yourself vulnerable to a well-placed hit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Decent light/middleweight so long as you crack on with it.  

The variety between boards is most apparent with the final round, which is probably as it should be.  Long time now since I played Auf Heller & Pfennig but I think it tailed off a bit, whereas this didn't.  I'd like to try AHuP again as a result, to check that conclusion.  

Nice production but I wish they'd used all that cardboard to give us a scoreboard instead of coins.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
UPDATE: I do like this game, but there is no denying it's pretty lucky ... so it falls into the category of "conflicted" designs for me, ones where you put a fair amount of thought into your moves, and there is a lot of strategy you can apply, but there is also a lot of luck which can wipe that strategy out. Anyway, it's still a fun game, and short enough it doesn't bother me unduly. But it's still the Auf Heller engine, and that engine does feel old.
---
Funny, but this is, on first impressions, the best design job to come out of FFG's in-house designers in ages (if not ever). They took one of Knizia's old, fairly mediocre games and tweaked it enough to make it quite interesting. The asymmetrical boards, the 2+1-tile hands, the progression through the three acts all combine to give the game a much more textured and satisfactory feel, all with the same, pretty simple engine.

I enjoyed this. It's light - probably still a little conflicted, a little bit too much work for the payoff, and a little sensitive to getting the right crowd - but I thoroughly enjoyed this one, while I've always strongly disliked Kingdoms/Auf Heller.

The theme is thin, but you can almost make it out. Not quite, but it's not the *total* paste-up job Auf Heller was. It's just barely enough for me.

Nothing on Kiniza's Beowulf: The Legend, but still.

YES!  This game may be light on the theme, but the gameplay is enjoyable and a little bit thinky.  Both 2 player and 3 player games were very good.  Fill the spaces that make up rows and columns with positive and/or negative numbers.  Then place one of your scoring multipliers in a space and score once all the spaces are filled.  Special tile powers increase the strategy.  Fun!

I'm not sure why this game isn't more popular.  It's fun and super inexpensive (as of March 2015).  I can't imagine this theme being that much different than the original Kingdoms.

I like the fact the game is divided into 3 rounds. It helps keeping track of everyone's score and also gives you a chance to adapt your strategy along the way. Perfect length (a little over 1h?). A great balance between strategy and simplicity. It pisses me off that it's missing more big attack (negative) moves to make it really shine, but like it nonetheless!

The game "Kingdoms", in a new, improved version.
Feels much less repetitive due to the different boards.

It has randomness, but the game's simple and quick enough that it's still a great experience.

Overall more fun than Kingdoms... shame that the Beowulf license (which has little to do with the game itself), prevented the game from effectively replacing the original Kingdoms, which this replaces in every way.

I think the game would've done better to be released as a generic number game.

Some of the tiles allow a player to move/remove already placed tiles/pieces.  This generally brings with it a feeling of either relief or frustration.

Worth playing if someone else brings it, but I don't recommend buying it unless you get a really good deal.

I'd be interested to know if Knizia had a hand in the update, or if it was like LOTR Confrontation expansion and was just designed by FFG team.  Knizia designs have a fun/cleverness about them, the new tiles and ideas had a fun/extreme element about them which appear more FFG style.

We remove the Golden Statue tile since it introduces luck-base out-of-place over-powered screwage.

Es como el Kingdoms del mismo autor, pero con unos poderes especiales, miniaturas diferentes y tableros diferentes. Quizá más variado y mejor, aunque algunos poderes puedan descompensar un poco y los tableros sean demasiado oscuros.

I haven't played the original Kingdoms so I cannot comment on any changes. Even in this new incarnation, however, the game is a pretty good example for an early Knizia, although the theme is a little more pasted on than usual. But hey, it's a licensed product after all.

So what you get here is simple yet engaging gameplay with the caveat that some of the special tiles can turn it into a fairly chaotic and somewhat confrontational experience.

Auf Heller w/a twist. Each round played on a different board, game play is ok, but the tension that exists in Auf Heller from tile counting and the strategies you can implement are lost in this updated version of the mechanic with a luck factor that comes from playing certain tiles. The ability of one tile allows switching of two previously played tiles, which can swing the game dramatically and ruin any strategic playing. I think such a mechanic works better when evryone has that same ability and it is known as in Samurai. Then the tension builds from when best to play yours.
Would play Auf Heller over this any day.

Contrary to most other reviewers, I did not find the theme to be pasted on. Most reviewers seem to feel the theme is the Beowulf legend. It is not. The theme is that you are a bard or skald retelling the Beowulf legend and it is your rendition of the tale which is represented in the pieces and the boards. The use of the three acts with elements of the tale varying with the act is a good integration of the theme.

As far as play goes this is an improved Kingdoms.

First, some context. I purchased this at Cancon13 for a single $1. So, provided it wasn't a bucket of fat, I was going to be happy. It's again your RK typical game; dryish, min-max abstract. Bit of angst when you play it, and you never feel your really in control.  There is one killer tile (Golden Statue) that can really sway the game, but I actually like it - it provides a deep slash to a game that can become locked into a groove.  I do like the fact of having three different boards for each round, with each board having a different flavour. In all, a solid seven game I'm happy to have as part if the collection, rules are easy to pick up and explain, but not something I would play too often (1/2/13). UPDATE: With three players, this is an even more intense game - recommended (15/2/13) UPDATE Still interested (Rating 7.415 Jan 17).

Where's Beowulf in that? There's too much counting in this game. Not planning, but counting. You can count almost everything, so if other players are patient, you do that. It's awful and NOT exciting.
But still, it makes your mind concentrated and sometimes, gives opportunity to invent some "strategy". 

Maybe i should try Kingdom first, to decide whether the Beowulf is a good game, or no.

Beautifully illustrated game that's very loosely based on the legend but the gameplay is original (although it's a re-theme of Knizia's Kingdoms) and engaging so why not to try?

Not sure about this one.  I like Kingdoms a lot, but this version may prove that more does not necessarily equal better.

Haven't played this.

The Beowulf version of Kingdoms/Auf Heller und Pfennig adds a few bells and whistles. First of all the new tiles look really ugly, but then again so did the tiles from Kingdoms. There's now a different board for each of the three rounds. Sounds like a good idea. Players now have a two-tile hand and can draw a third tile and then play any of the three. Sounds cool as well. There are now different types of tiles that can bump each other off the board. Okay, no real opinion on that until I try it. The tile mix appears to be more skewed towards positive points. Eh, I'm skeptical there, but I'd have to try it to be certain. The dragon now adds negative six to its column and row in addition to canceling all the positive tiles. Ouch, that's definitely a bad change. Finally, there's a new type of tile that switches the position of two tiles already on the board. Yikes, that just sounds like an utterly horrible decision.

I'd like to try it out just to see if the new boards change the feel of the game. I'll try the "hand of 2+1" rule next time I play Kingdoms. That sounds like it could be good.

Beowulf is a wonderful remake of Knizia's Kingdoms. The components are upgraded in quality and the addition of three different boards is magnificent. Enjoyable game with aggressive interaction among players. Often feels like you are fighting to lose the fewest points.

Not rated higher because of the lack of balance among the tiles (which is only intensified in this remake). This adds significant randomness and heartbreaking chaos. Can feel like you just got punched in the gut when someone places the Treachery or Golden Statue. If you want a closer, less chaotic game then amend some of these tiles or remove them altogether (or just play Kingdoms).

Have had no desire to play recently. Up for trade.

I haven't play Kingdoms yet, but I wish I had before this came out. I love the mechanics in this game.

This is an exercise in multiplication.  And not the fun multiplication either.  Would I like this better if the publishers had been straight about what this is; a Knizia abstract maths puzzle, rather than managing the disappointment of quickly discovering that the theme is pasted on (in truth, not even pasted on, rather, attached by small buttons of dried out blue tak)?  Probably not, but I wouldn't have had my time wasted, nor would my friend feel aggravated after spending her hard earned on what she thought would be a 'Beowulf experience'.  Doesn't do what it says on the tin.

The different boards are an interesting improvement over "Kingdoms", but some new tiles, having the ability to replace others, just add chaos. Having a hand of tiles seems to be a good idea, but it also increases the potential of those with special powers, as you can choose to play them when they are most effective. And at least one tile is ridiculously overpowered.

hmmmm.  I love Kingdoms.  Changes are enough to give it a different feel.  I'm not sure if they didn't do to much to it.  In the long run, I think I might like Kingdoms more, for it's simplicity.  

I don't like that you have a larger hand and that you get to draw and choose which of the three you want to play.  I liked the decision making prior of having to decide to play the tile in your hand OR draw and play the random tile.

Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms redone. Do yourself a favor and disintegrate the "golden statue" tile before playing the game, as it breaks the game. As this is essentially Kingdoms, and it is more compact game, you should get it instead of this.

Not to be confused with Reiner Knizia's [gameid=119], from which it stems.

Actually, it is an improved [gameid=119] with a different slapped on theme.

There are a few added twists such as tiles which can be removed, 3 boards, 3 different set of tiles (one per board).

FFG did a good job with the components, but sadly, it remains too close to the original to be that much better.

RATING: 6
This had some bright spots but the "take that" play is pretty disappointing. The tile play is interesting, and having 3 different boards is a really cool idea. Some of those ultra-powerful tiles should probably just be tossed out though. "Take that" is fine if it's just hosing each other out of a point or two, but that big negation tile can hose the first place player all the way to the bottom of the heap. A shame, because some of this stuff is pretty clever.

7 is the rating for our home made variant that makes the game playable. As printed the game is a 4.

Recommended variant:

Good Counsel becomes 'Shady Counsel': It works as printed in the reminder sheet, not in the rules, so you can use the effect on ANY figure, not just one of yours. This turns a very narrow, almost unplayable tile into a good thing.

Golden Man becomes 'Golden old man', and instead of letting you swap any two tiles on the board, it only swaps two ADJACENT tiles on the board. So instead of 50+ point swings near the end of an act, we get 20 point swings.

Treachery works like the Dragon in Kingdoms: It only makes the positives 0 when scoring that row or column, instead of affecting the tiles themselves. It still keeps the -6. This makes the tile quite powerful, but not quite as powerful. Still, turning this into the Dragon by removing the -6 would not be unreasonable.

And there you go, a much more playable game that is not a total luckfest.

A modest improvement to Knizia's Kingdoms in that you get a hand of tiles and various board shapes. There's still a high luck factor in which tiles you draw (values range from -6 to +5) and a substantial chaotic element with plenty of late game tile swapping. A superb game by the standards of most movie tie-ins, but not one to feel agrieved about losing.

It plays strange.  In Kingdoms you knew what to do, here you have no idea (at least in the 1st game).

EDIT: I prefer Kingdoms.
  New version is too chaotic and overly sophisticated/artificially complicated.  And there is at least 1 tile which is waaay overpowered.

In addition graphic design is dreadful - hopeless colors of miniatures and graphics on tiles.  Only graphics of boards is ok.

Still - at its heart it's good ol' Kingdoms so it's not a bad game.

I'm not sure Kingdoms really needed a retheming, or three different boards.  The theme is almost humorously slapped on in a way the original avoids -- the board and the tiles really imply that one can erect mountains in the middle of a treasure room, or stop to drink mead in the middle of a climactic battle with a dragon. The dragon's being upgraded to a -6 as well as positive-tile destruction is even more unbalancing than the dragon was in the original Kingdoms, and that's saying something.

A Knizia game based on an older game of his called "Kingdoms". The Beowulf version was thoughtful, pretty light, with a streak of nastiness mixed in. The game is played in three "acts", which are played on three different gameboard arrangments for placing tiles. On a turn, a player either places a tile (which has a value ranging from -6 to +6) or a scoring figure (which has a multiplier of 1 to 4). When all the squares of the board are filled, the figures are scored and players move on to the next board. Scoring means adding up all the tiles in a row and column that a figure is on, applying the mulitplier for a positive or negative score, and getting the points. Some tiles have special abilities that allow you to swap tiles, move figures, and so on. At the end of three acts the game is over, and the highest score wins. 

It's not earthshaking by any means. The difference from Kingdoms is that there are a few different special tiles and different grid arrangements between the 3 acts. While in Kingdoms all of the tiles are mixed the same way for all acts, in Beowulf there are act-specific tiles and there seems to be less negative/nasty tiles in the later acts, which is a curious design choice. I think I would have prefered the nastiness ratio to stay the same or get worse. The box is huge for the simplicity of the game.

For this game system, I definitely prefer the shorter and more streamlined versions like Dragon Master and Robot Master to something like this, which is essentially a beefed up version of Kingdoms. If Beowulf means something to you, maybe the art would be appealing. But for me this is definitely a lesser Knizia. I see the appeal, but the appeal is not for me.

Based on one play, a four-player game.  Note that as a first-time player of this game unless you're aware that the composition of the tiles for each of the three acts  is very different (primarily the first and second vs. the third) then you're bound to be disappointed.  Knowing how the three acts play out now, I may feel differently after a second play of this game.  But I really don't care if I have a second play of this game.  The game wasn't really interesting to me to begin with and the artwork was nothing special.  I might play it again (just to give it a second chance) and my rating could possible go up from a 4 to a 5, possibly even a six but I have no interest in ever finding out.

It's a pretty big box for a decent game. 
so this is Kingdoms with special tiles ??? Besides the overpowered Treason and especially the golden statue I think it's a fine game.
After one play and having an idea which tiles are in which age i don't see it as a big problem though.
In the third age  the leader will lose a big chunk of his lead and the person in last spot will e able to gain a lot.

Our scores were 196 (yeah) ; 187 and 146. I could have scored more but i was afraid of a treason or golden statue card in the last age.

OK, there is a bit of thinking or strategies but it does not generate any interesting feeling while playing. You just want to try to optimise your score.

The only innovative mechanic I found is that you play the game on 3 different board through the course of the game. The problem is that in the first 2 games, you don't want to sacrifice some characters because you don't know if they would be that much valuable later.

want your head to hurt?  Like math?  This is your game.  I like the 3 different boards ("Acts") as it does mix it up a bit and gives you the option of playing a full 3 act game or just go with one act for a quick game.

RATING: 7
Well - it's basically Kingdoms with a few additional rules and a different theme. At first I thought that the new rules would make the game more chaotic and make it lose its "elegance" but I was wrong. In Kingdoms the board was static. This meant that it was IMPOSSIBLE to make an informed decision, especially when playing with 3 or 4 players. By the time the round came back to you, you could have had like -10 points placed in the row with your x4 multiplier tile... Because of the new special tiles you can always try to defend yourself before the next scoring and the board is scored ONLY at the end of the round - not when a row or column has been filled. The only problem I can see is the overpowered "dragon" tile. There was one in Kingdoms as well but here it has a value of -6 in ADDITION to its plus-point nullifying effect which basically screws other players over REALLY badly. Your  10x4 row can turn into a -6x4 row in the blink of an eye... I suggest playing the tile disregarding its face value which makes the game far more balanced...

I picked this up for $6 or so, and it's one of the best bargain buys I've ever made -- it's a great game.

Ignoring the Beowulf theme, which is paper-thin but doesn't detract from the game in any way, everything else about it rocks. It's easy to learn, with very few rules, and it packs a great mix of strategy, tactics, and just the right amount of luck into a short play time.

The three boards, the ability to hold your tiles from round to round, and the need to conserve your non-renewable pieces for the right moment -- possibly in future rounds -- this game generates a nice amount of turn angst without crossing into analysis paralysis.

There's a lot to think about, but on any given turn you don't have 10 decisions to make; that's an excellent balance for me.

02/16/08 Played a three player game, once. Another math exercise from Knizia with a theme the thickness of a coat of fine dust. I didn't see the movie its based on. So most of the (dreary) artwork meant nothing to me. They were just positive and negative tiles, period. The plastic playing pieces were a mixed bag. The ships looked nice. The castles on a hill looked like something that dropped from the hind end of a dog. I might play it again, but I won't be asking for it.

Absolutely no tie-in with the movie except for the title. Wasn't crazy about [i]Kingdoms[/i] (what a joyless game) which begs the question why I went ahead and bought this. Well, my ony defense is that it was on sale for practically nothing. Still I should have known better: it's the same game with a few cosmetic tweaks. Admittedly the boards are very nice. I was hoping it would fit inside my other Beowulf/Knizia game (which is vastly superior by the way). No such luck. [1 play; gave away Jun'12]

Has a different feel to Kingdoms though basically the same game.  Whereas Kingdoms there is a good feel of what tiles are left because the distribution of tiles is fairly easy to remember.  In this game, there are three sets of tiles and very difficult to keep track of everything.  In addition, you have a hand of two tiles that you play on top of the one you draw.  All in all, I think it is a more enjoyable version to Kingdoms.

First off, the game has nothing to do with Beowulf.  The theme could be anything.  Second off, if you don't like multiplication and addition the game is not for you.

It's a numbers game looking to score points based on placed tiles within rows and columns. Various tiles affect opponents scores.  Best played with 3 to 4 players (and a calculator).

I really love this game. It's a true tile placement game. Like the other Beowulf game, it's designed by Reiner Knizia (spelling?), plays like an abstract euro game with clever mechanics, elegant gameplay and has about a 40 minute or less run-time. Also like Beowulf: The Legend, it's easy to set-up and explain yet still allows for layer upon layer of nuanced skill and strategy to work. Like Fantasy Flight's other games, the components and overall quality and art are fantastic--though you don't quite get enough for your value if you pay full retail for this. I definitely recommend this game. The theme is painted on, quite literally. This used to be called "Kingdoms" but they altered the fluff, the art, the tiles, and miniatures and cashed in on the Beowulf movie. I think this was an improvement as it reprinted a great board game but gave it a more specific and fun theme--even if it was just painted on a largely abstract game.

Fun game I definitely recommend of true tile placement and area influence and control.

First impression (4 players): 
As I liked Kingdoms and got this remake for cheap I thought to try it without reading too much about it. Somehow I don't understand how you can turn a good game into an average/bad by adding too much hassle and randomness into it. Some tiles in beowulf are simply changing the game too much. There is couple of symbols too much in game as you need a help sheet (provided with game). And those symbols are making game just too random: Plusses turning into minuses and then back to plusses and especially "swap two tiles" is already silly. In Kingdoms you basically knew what you're getting if your placing your castle but in Beowulf you can only hope for the best if you don't have one of the supertiles in your hand. Some of the best ones there is only a couple of but even those few are too much already. Oh yes, having different tile set for each of the 3 rounds is called overproducing..

I liked some changes though: Having a hand of 2 and draw-and-then-play a tile gives you more flexibility. Although with it you can wait with your powerful minus/bad ass tile for that perfect spot to hit your opponents. Not sure if this actually is good after all... Also having 3 different boards for 3 rounds is a nice change. Overall there are some good ideas but more bad ones added making this inferior edition to Kingdoms.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It is with a heavy heart that I rate a Knizia so low. Just bone-dry, way too mathy, opaque strategy, nothing to do with Beowulf (yes, I realize this was a paste on from Kingdoms). I might have seen the use for this game in the past, but now that we have Qin, it's difficult for this to find its niche. Qin plays shorter, with more obvious strategic and tactical considerations, with less of an influence by Lady Luck. It's also more elegant.

Some have called this a broken game but I disagree. The Statue piece is powerful but there's only one so it doesn't really tip the game balance. Simple house rules can tone down any aspect of the game that have been changed from the original Kingdoms version. Play one round for a quick filler, or a full three acts for a more strategic and involved session.

Beowulf: The Movie Board Game is a re-implementation of Knizia's tile-laying game Kingdoms.  On each turn, a player either places a tile that effects the scoring of its row and column in the grid, or places a figure to score its row and column with some multiplier depending on the piece.  In this version of the game, there are three different game board (one for each round), each with its own associated tile set.  The last round is on a double-wide board, which lends itself to the "epic ending" sort of feel.  I don't think I like the separate tile sets, especially as the round 2 tiles seem to be harsh to the extent that playing figures in round 2 may not be worth it.  Some of the tiles in this game also have special abilities on them, which generally has the effect of increasing the "take-that" factor of the game.  While I appeciated the increases variety in this game, particularly with the game boards, I don't find the other changes to really be an improvement.

Abstract w/ a theme pasted on.   There is no Beowulf feel.  It could be a good game but the luck of the draw makes the analysis sometimes worthless.   Analysis paralysis is huge with this game and the worst thing is that is can have no bearing since the luck of the draw can take control.   Wild swings especially in the second round can destroy this game.  For a game that is so numbers ordinated its too much work for reward.      I rate this game bases in the fact that knowing the tiles each turn is important.This is a math puzzle with luck thrown in to make your work useless.

It's Auf Heller und Pfennig / Kingdoms with additional chrome and a few rules tweaks.  We like the original game, and this chromed-up version seems nice, and the new special actions are interesting, though they may introduce too much chaos.

But the beautifully lush rich art is sort of overwhelming; we liked the simple elegant clear art of the original Auf Heller und Pfennig the best.  The plastic figures are hard to read/distinguish until you get used to them; the little scoring diamonds are hard to see.  I shouldn't have to think about painting them to make them clearer... It's a triumph of beauty over usefulness, which detracts from enjoyment of playing the game.

The Beowulf theme is a bit nonsensical since your unique powerful Beowulf piece goes away after using it once (even though thematically Beowulf should participate in all 3 parts) while the weakest pieces remain forever, so that's odd, but whatever.

Vicious abstract strategy game.

A re-implementation of [b]Kingdoms[/b] but with more tiles that are antagonistic (some may read the word "random" instead). I greatly enjoy that the game comes with THREE different boards to play on as well as THREE different sets of tiles, giving it high re-play value. True, it's more chaotic than the former as tiles can remove others or even move scoring figures, but changes in having a larger hand size and a larger variety in tiles and playing field are improvements.

[b]Kingdoms[/b] is probably the better game as one can form stronger strategies, but this one is slightly more fun as it's so reactionary.

We love it so far. It feels a bit like a 3-level puzzle game, except you're playing against each other rather than the game. Yeah, there's a little math to do when planning your move, but neither of us thought it was bad. I haven't played Kingdoms, but this feels like prime Knizia. I expect my rating to go up with future plays.

Purely an abstract, nothing really to do with Beofulf at all. Enjoayable enough if a little repetitive, played it a couple of times as a 2 player, didn't include the super-power cards from the word go, I got it cheap so it was worth it.

An enhanced version of Knizia's "Kingdoms". Even though this is sort of abstract, the production values are high and the theme is gorgeous. Just make sure to house-rule the Golden Statue as only applying to the row and column where it is placed (not all over the map).

RATING: 7.25
A nicely produced, easy to learn abstract tile-laying game.  Apparently, it's a souped-up version of 'Kingdoms' (which I've never played).  You place figures with different multiplier values and tiles with positive and negative scores, subject to some special actions/powers, then total the columns and rows for each player's figures.  It's played in three 'acts', on differently configured boards. Great artwork and plastic miniatures, but nothing really to do with Beowulf at all, so don't worry if you don't know the story or the movie.  Good fun, with quite some strategy, and plenty of opportunity for other players to mess your plans up, and vice versa.  Definitely recommended.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed this game quite a bit!  I was surprised by how different each Act felt.  I never was much for Auf Heller..ummm.. Kingdoms, but this one is something I could see playing again!  Has nothing to do with the theme, but the game is fun.  After second play, I'm going to take out the special ability of the treachery tile - it's too much.

A more complicated Kingdoms, but I'm not sure it is better for the changes. I suppose it offers the game a bit more replayability, but at the expense of the elegance of design...

Update: It really is pretty swingy with the tiles that cancel out others (the mead/drunkeness tiles and the valour ones too) though so long as you're aware of these you can at least choose whether to attempt to score them. The dragon in Kingdoms is here, except now it is also a -6 tile. All in all, too much randomness added to a game that isn't without randomness any way.

Rating down from 6.5 to 6.

Clearly a Reiner Knizia tile laying design.  Beautiful board, nice chits and sculptures.  I do think the Golden Statue chit should be removed- whoever draws this will probably win and that creates too much luck for my taste. That said, it's every bit as good as Kingdoms.

My wife, in some strange, altered universe moment tonight, said that she "really likes this game."  

It's been sitting on my shelf now for 3 years.  Tonight, after getting half way through the CGI movie, I decided to pull it out.  We had a tense game.  She won.  The game has just entered a permanent place in my collection.

Stunned.  I'm stunned.  An abstract by Knizia about Beowulf?  Huh.

Simply a masterpiece (call it a meaty filler) where everything builds to a crescendo on three stages. [i]You cannot give your opponents a break and expect to win[/i]. The one thing I don't like about this game, is when it's over.. and no Angelina.. and, the fact that we always seem to forget who goes first at the next act (but that's easily fixed with a tile or standee), and the fact this game has almost nothing to do with the movie, but, then we just start another game.

The fact that this game exists is very silly.  [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/17/fantasy-flight-games]Fantasy Flight Games[/url] clearly wanted to capitalize on the 2007 Beowulf movie coming out.  They already had one game about Beowulf, [gameid=17449], which is a serviceable, if light, adaptation of the poem.  Then they muddied the water and caused no end of confusion by putting out another game called Beowulf, this time called Beowulf: The Movie Board Game  As if it's not confusing enough to have one company publishing two unrelated games with the same title, both are by the same designer, and the second is really just a retheme of a different game entirely, [gameid=119].  What was FFG thinking with this title?  Maybe they were hoping to break into big box stores with this cash-in on a franchise with popular mechanics?  A rare misstep by the usually savvy FFG.

It's a decent game, but the theme is obviously quite pasted on.  Nothing about this game seems Beowulf-y.  Not only does tile-drawing have nothing to do with Beowulf, there's four different Beowulfs.  The gameplay is strong, but not exceptional, with microturns which force you to choose between placing a new figure or placing a tile to make your current figures more valuable.  The components are nice, but the art is somewhat rough, as the CG graphics of the movie don't translate well to the static medium of cardboard where all flaws can be seen more closely.

I like Knizia, I like tile-laying, I like Beowulf, and the game sounded great after reading the rules.  Put it all together and it just feels... blah.

I really think the crux of the issue is too much randomness, exacerbated by two extremely powerful tiles (golden statue and treachery).  While there is unquestionably room for strategy throughout most of the game, the fact that these tiles create such a huge swing makes the effort elsewhere feel a bit pointless.

I really like the three acts with different board shapes, the special tile abilities, and many other aspects of the game.  While the components are generally great, the little figurines have some minor design issues--their strength (represented by diamonds on their bases) are only printed on one side and are difficult to read.

I expect this will get at least a few more plays, but definitely a disappointment.

I love Kingdoms and this is better for the following reasons:
 - better components
 - more varied boards
 - more strategic planning since u keep more tiles in hand
 - some more interesting effects

What's not as good as Kingdoms is that some tiles have maybe a too strong effect and the player that draws such  tiles could be advantaged.
Beowulf doesnt feel so beautifully clean as Kingdoms as u need to learn more tiles effects. 
But i like it more !

RATING: 6
This "improved" version of Kingdoms is now significantly longer (larger hand size = more thinking and more downtime), dangerously unbalanced (Treachery and Golden Statue tiles), and less functional (values on new difficult-to-read figurines vs. original castles).

On a positive note, to be fair, some of the new special actions (drunkenness, valor, etc.) and board modifications are quite interesting.

Still, I honestly don't see how anyone can prefer this to the original.  In addition to the problems listed above - as others have pointed out - the increased hand size makes the unbalanced tiles even more powerful, since these game-winners can be held until the perfect moment of play.  Moreover, in the original, there was a real tension as to whether a player should play the "hidden" tile or be forced to play whatever tile is drawn.  In Beowulf, even if lousy tile is a drawn, the player can always play a different tile.

What was FFG thinking?

(Rating would be lower, except that Beowulf is based on a game engine that is still original and fun.)

The box says it's a Knizia, so I didn't think too much about the theme. Thus I didn't get dissapointed either :).
I really like this one, it's short, easy to explain and deliciously nasty. Personally I like it better than Kingdoms, 3 tiles to choose from, tiles that interact with others and 3 different boards. Plus, it's darn cheap to get and language independent.

I am of the opinion that Kingdoms is a much superior game than Beowulf.  The reason why the original is tight and cutthroat is due to its restrictive rules and the fact that once a piece is on the board, that is where it will remain for the round.  However, the latter version made everything so much more forgiving.  Not only in the tile draw itself, but also by introducing new powers where you can remove, swap and reposition pieces.  This added layer of randomness is unwelcome and served to dilute the tension that made Kingdoms such a neat game.  The only new element I liked was the variable board, but with the exception of the built-in mountains for Act II, bigger area simply translated to longer play time, it doesn't actually make the experience more strategic.

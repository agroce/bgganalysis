RATING: 8
UPDATE--just don't get to play this enough, despite liking it. Would love to trade to a good home.

Game looks great, but haven't had a chance to try it out yet.  The force wall grenades in particular look like they'd add a ton to the game.  

[update] Love the theme and minis, but the board is pretty ugly.  Would like to play a few more times so both sides can gain some tactical experience--I felt like the mission we played gave the machines a pretty big advantage, and the gap between forces got wider with more inexperience.  Neat, simple system--would like to play it more!

Good system and easy to play. The different missions don't seem very well planned though as there is always a strong benifit either to the machines or to the commandos.

RATING: N/A
Very much like the old computer game, "Laser Squad". The board and components can be mixed with those from Space Hulk as well as those from Doom the Boardgame. I haven't actually played this game as stand-alone yet.

Update: traded all my LoS stuff away. It's not bad, but setup and teardown is brutal and there are much better tactical minis games these days.

----------

Top-tier tactical minis game.  I own a boatload of ish for this game: template packs, tons of minis, tons of counters, several rulebooks, etc.  I never got into the alien races (Fantasians, Infranites, Black Empire), but I still love playing point-buy with the humans and machines.

RATING: 7
Fun, slightly complex miniatures game that reminds me of chess for some reason.  Very similar to Space Hulk.

RATING: 10
An excellent game with superficial similarities to Space Hulk, but way more depth. Easily the best sci-fi miniatures skirmish game I have ever played.

I have a large number of miniatures for trade from all 5 factions (U.N.E., Machine, Infranite, Fantasian, and Black Empire).

I am also looking for various miniatures from all 5 factions.

An excellent game with superficial similarities to Space Hulk, but way more depth. Easily the best sci-fi miniatures skirmish game I have ever played.

While I feel that the unit mix of the Black Box (1st edition) was better, this is still an awesome game.

Space Hulk-like, except humans are the close-in fighters (still ranged, but shorter range), while the robots are ranged fighters. Only one play a while ago, so no rating.

RATING: 7
A lot of fun to play.  In some ways it's superior to Space Hulk.  The cover fire rules make more sense than the comparable rule in Space Hulk.  It lacks GW's marketing power and therefore its name recognition.  Out of print and getting hard to find.  If you can't track down a copy of Space Hulk, this is not a bad alternative.

A friend of mine owns this. He bought it in large part because of the "one pound of metal" tagline on the box cover! We also saw this as a step up from the Hero Quest and Mutant Chronicles we had been playing at the time, and it was just that. It was a fun experience, and we played it a number of times. It's been a few years now, but I'd give it another try if he can find it (he's moved numerous times, and some of his games haven't turned up!)

Better than Games Workshop's Space Hulk. Top notch combat system, the weapons charts are wonderful and the command system rules. I love this and if you want it they can still be had cheaply on eBay.

I much prefer this game to GWs Space Hulk. While similar, it has more variety to the troop types on both sides. The expansions add greater depth and the potential for interesting campaigns. The miniatures in the full game set are pretty cool too.

I've got both the black box and the blue box.  Picked them up cheap a long time ago as an alternate source of Necron miniatures to play 40K using the early White Dwarf Necron army lists, but never developed a full 40K army and have not yet played the original game.

Played it in the nineties. I remember liking the first scenarios but the the game got impossible for one of the sides to win. As it was very unbalanced, my friends stopped playing it. The components aren't that good and my version only came with cardboard stand-ups.

This game has tons of cool options you can do in the game.  I can see the comparisons to Space Hulk, as they are similar games.  And as much as I do like Space Hulk, I have to agree LoS is even better.

Another attempt to get away from 40k.  Another rules system I didn't find players for.
Space Hulk was more attractive, more accessible, and more fun.

Played a heck of a lot of this back in high school - an enjoyable game with a very different feel than Space Hulk, despite certain similarities in genre.  Like so many other games, the expansions gradually received less and less testing and suffered from more and more power creep, but you can have a lot of fun with the basic set and the first expansion (which limits itself to only 4 new models and whose scenarios actually received testing).  Between playing with my friends and at cons, I've been through the first scenario about 15 times - I recall a pretty even split.

To expand a little on how it differs from Space Hulk, virtually every unit in Legions of Steel is equipped with some sort of ranged weapon and there exists much more variety in the sort of attacks you can execute. (for example: suppressive fire can be used to deny a hall way or spread fire to target a group of enemies)  The grenades should not be overlooked by new players - they possess considerable tactical importance - the force wall grenades, in particular, lend themselves to a variety of uses and hard decisions in how to maximize their return.

RATING: 8.5
More options than Space Hulk which makes for a deeper game but out of the 3 or 4 times I've played the marines have a really hard time. Even harder than the marines in Space Hulk but not quite as hard as the marines in Doom. Still a really good game wth a bit of a learning curve to the strategy employed.

Awesome game, brilliant mechanics.  Looses some points on the originality scale for the obvious Space Hulk influence and the cheesy Terminator-esque robots, and it is slightly clunky with so many modifiers.  Still, don't let that deter you from this overlooked gem.  There are tons of tactical options open to each player at any given moment, but the game plays very quickly and smoothly.  HIGHLY recommendable.

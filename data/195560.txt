RATING: 6
Mixed feeling about this one - single play. On one hand, it's a well-designed, quality game. it also has beautiful thematic art & amazingly well-designed component trays. I can see this being one of someone's favorite games, but the combination of pick-up and deliver mechanics with a bunch of dice rolling just makes it fall flat for me. I dramatically lost and yet I couldn't point to any particular error - just a whole lot of bad rolls. Being more of a euro game, I just don't really enjoy that. Toward the end of the game, I was also quite bored due to the repetitive nature of the game. Yes, I was making more money and bigger deliveries, but it wasn't nearly as exciting as a game like Great Western Trail, where the game culminates in massive super-powerful actions. I probably wouldn't play again, although I am glad I gave it a try.

By BGG rating it's Mediocre - take it or leave it. The components are absolutely stellar with some great inserts from Game Trayz, unfortunately the game mechanics themselves really fail to have any sort of lasting power.And while there's little to no downtime surprisingly we started to get bored and not care much by mid to late game. Not much player interaction. Pretty luck based if you manage to draw a card that has a location close to you. Combat mechanics aren't all that fun and unforgivably you can't attack other players in this mad max like world, it's obviously the first question people ask about. Great Components, interesting art (though not my tastes) but ultimately disappointing Mechanics and gameplay.

This is a beautiful production but a pretty boring game.  I had a similar reaction to this as I did to Riddle and Pinchback's Fleet.  There were a lot of clever ideas and things that seemed to work well but there was no fun, no tension, nothing in the way of interesting decisions.  

Shelf space is a rare commodity and highly prized in my home. If you are gonna be a game in a big square box, you gotta be something special.

Wasteland has a lot going for it but not much of it is in the game-play.  It sets out to have this rich mad-max theme paired with solid euro mechanics and it doesn't succeed well at either. While the SETTING is wonderfully realized, the detail doesn't shine through in the playing of the game. What you end up with is a fairly boring, plodding game. It falls into a category of games that I have started to call "Just a game that works", in that all the buttons and levers produce the expected result without the gears grinding, but there isn't anything fun or interesting going on.

Fun game with a Race for the Galaxy feel in the mechanisms/goals. Incredible value comes in the box..Yes it includes GameTrayz. Fully modular everything(hex board,cards,tokens) is ripe for expansion and non repetitive replay.Fantastic Art showcases the Mad Max theme.
The amount of pieces is fiddly and intimidating but the actual gameplay is simple and smooth. Someone who is slow at this game is definitely suffering from AP and should just quit the denial.
Can't wait to play PVP and or Campaign modes.

RATING: 6
The production quality and art are top notch. The game looks fun and the included trays save the game from being a disaster to set up. The production and art, however, belie how mechanical the game feels as you play it. The game seems to put the pressure on the players themselves to make a session pop with fun. 

The end-game objectives (priority contracts) are varied and add good flavor to the game. You can even select a set of priority contracts to make the game more raiding/pillaging heavy or more delivery-based. A few of them add new mechanisms to the game that inject even more flavor. But the priority contracts are what you build up to accomplish and not what you spend most of the time doing. The standard contracts, smuggling runs and raider enclaves take the majority of the action and they have little meaningful variation. 

Mechanically, Wasteland is very sound, but it seems like there could be a lot more game wrought out of this system. Perhaps this is the skeleton and the true game will come with the release of an expansion or two? I'll keep my eyes open, because there is potential here.

Pick-up and deliver with one of my favorite themes slapped on it! Love the Borderlands-esque art-work! Not without it's faults, jobs can feel samey, can't attack the other players, some randomness that can affect the games outcome but I still enjoy it. Hopefully the game will see an exp. at some point that allows for more pvp conflict and variety.

Not for me. Too slow of a build up and lots of down time in between turns with nothing to do. Plus pickup delivery mechanic seemed very secondary to combat upgrading. Not what I expected.

Mad max in a delivery game!?!?!? Yes, please. For me, I like playing with the two variants listed in the rulebook that allows for map wrapping for raiders and player vs player combat. I feel that this is more in the nature of the game. The storage solution that comes with the game is epic! It is still beastly to set up.

Very good pick up and deliver game. The theme is strong. The game play felt familiar. I felt is was similar to Merchant of Venus or even Xia. I liked this game more than either of those, but after 75 minutes or so it was hard to continue to care about the eventual outcome. Everyone ids boosted up and it's just a matter of who has side objectives that are more efficiently placed. I like the game and the theme, but it overstays it's welcome for me by 30-45 minutes.

I really liked the idea of an (kind of) open world pick up and deliver game, but the execution was not to my taste in this case. I think that it lacks in depth and the individualization of your truck is way too easy to accomplish and therefore not meaningful enough for me. I ordered Xia with the expansion, maybe that will be the game I was looking for.

RATING: 8
This is a really, really fun game, with great theme, strong mechanics, (mostly indirect) player interaction, and amazing production.  It is refreshing to play and like a friend of mine says, theres nothing else like it that I own. 

BUT - it would be ranked even higher if the setup and tear down weren't quite so long.  And the first few plays will take a while.  We have it down to about an hour and fifteen minutes for three player games, but we move pretty quickly.  This game can cause some paralysis.

A game with simple actions, nuanced rules, and all the extras to sell the theme.  At its core there is a good optimization game in there, with maybe some slight balance issues.  Some of the priority contracts are way more difficult then others, especially some that you can acquire through the faction deck.  Very fun, seems to scale well, though can take a while.  With three we can get through a game in an hour.

I just didn't think I'd like a pickup & deliver game until this came along (not counting Xia: Legends of a Drift System here, which is far more open-ended.).

Sure the theme adds some verve, some brio, but I liked it for the clever use of octagonal terrain areas with their uneven areas/spaces, combined with the "momentum" idea to govern movement. The Dashboards are straightforward to use and certainly aid by keeping important rules front & center, in an almost haptic way. Other games of this type feel overcomplicated to me (I'm looking at you, Roads & Boats), or terribly simplistic. WEDS fits a nice middle ground for me.

This is the game [thing=138161][/thing] should have been: a fun, replayable, theme-packed pick-up and deliver AT-Euro hybrid that doesn't drag on for three hours. Turns are quick, decisions are meaningful, and there is just enough randomness to keep the game light and fun while preserving the solid core mechanics. 

The movement rules are nicely implemented (you can go faster with successive move actions as you "pick up speed") and I like how the limitations on pillaging and delivering force players to diversify their strategy. Good stuff. Rating may even go up with further plays.

Maybe the PERFECT middleweight game.  My whole family loved it - fast turns, easy to explain, simple and quick combat that doesn't bog the it down - then add game-to-game setup variability.  Instantly went into our family's top ten.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 5
WEDS was a bit of a disappointment for me, as I really enjoy pick-up and deliver, mission-based play, and commodity speculation-type stuff. So, on paper, this one looked like a big time match for my tastes. And I did like those elements of the game. A lot of it was a nice optimization puzzle, with some really fun thematic chrome.

However, other parts of the game were just too Ameritrashy for my taste. There are pretty crazy disparities in the strength of the baddies, and a good deal of luck in your roll to defeat them. Failing when you're trying to pillage can be a significant setback, and it just seemed a little too much in that regard. Plus, the combat part was just plain kind of... boring. You have this deck of beautifully illustrated and fun baddies, but they're just numbered 3-7 without any actual game play personality. And then, the entire battle is just a dice roll against that value. I don't know, it just felt like this could have been more interesting.

Or, some of the missions, like the one where you're digging for treasure, are ridiculously out there, where the difference between someone succeeding, and another player failing, can be multiple rounds.

Other aspects of the game just seemed like they could have been developed more to smooth out the rules. There are quite a few unintuitive niggly bits. For example, usually when you make a delivery, you use the delivery action. However, you can have cards that direct you to make special deliveries which feel a lot like the regular deliveries, but those use an outpost action, and the cards don't reinforce the unintuitive rule at all. It's important to get the rule right, though, as you only have a limited number of each action you're allowed to perform per round.

The game just has a lot of little things like this that are clunky/awkward/unintuitive, which add up to frustrate the experience a bit, and result in players asking a lot of questions that it seems could have been avoided with a little more fine tuning of the rules and card text.

If you still really like it beyond that, I think what's going on here is super neat though. Game to game variability is huge, as the map layouts, as well as the selection of goals you're shooting for will vary pretty greatly from game to game, which is really interesting. Plus, the production is gorgeous, set off by great art and the super cool and well thought out GameTrayz trays. I just felt the game play attention fell a bit short of the presentation attention, in the end.

Quality pick up and deliver adventure game. Plays very fast and smooth, with the micro actions being a huge boon to avoid downtime. Doesn't overstay its welcome and the mechanisms are enjoyable.

In terms of theme it gives you just enough to chew on without endless exposition. You definitely need to soak in the flavor text in order to squeeze the most out of it. 

Love the vehicle upgrade system which is reminiscent of Car Wars. Much more streamlined here and only a few options, but just enough to make different upgrade paths interesting.

Mechanically this has some more Euro blood than comparables such as Xia and Firefly. Dice results are more tightly constricted and are directly mitigated through upgrades. You can even avoid fighting somewhat (although it seems impossible to avoid completely if you want to win), and run a route with minimized luck. Even the tiles making up the map are identical on both sides, producing a more constricted range of setup parameters and ensuring a more smooth, less wild experience. I definitely wouldn't call this a Euro game, but it certainly has a good deal of Euro genetic makeup.

Downside is that the campaign mode feels a little tacked on and underwhelming. The game can also become repetitive at times as most jobs feel somewhat similar-a problem commonplace in this genre. I also wish the event deck was bigger and more unpredictable, as you will have seen all of the cards after two plays and the edge is slightly dulled as a result.

Weeeeee!!!  What a blast!  There are so many things to do and the theme is fantastic!  The only down side is that it can take several turns to accomplish one thing if you mismanage your truck and your resources.  I learned that the hard way.  Hopefully, I will do better in future games.  Don't blow all your cash right away, save some for purchasing goods. Choose Machine Guns over Gunner and get a RAD Shield.  I also think it is wise to explore the private contracts.  Have fun!

-Components are GREAT! 
-Pick up and delivery GREAT! 
-A great idea having this *mad Max post appocalyptic* theme. 
-Art is Ok (13 year old players with truckers having their boobs out and having a latex costume with a spiked dong*!) Come on! 

Here are the problems 
-Huge problems with the fiddly rulebook and rules that doesn't make any sense (Raiders attack you on the same zone, but not players?) 
-Big waste of time problems (When attacking a raider truck roll a dice, you don't succeed, wait for your next turn to roll it and if you don't succeed...) or (When you complete a contract that needs a bonus, even if you have everything, you have to wait your next turn to put that little gear on bonus* and claim it. Why not do it like Lords of Waterdeep. When done, just put the card on the table at the end of your turn) 
-Repetitive  (Not much to do and do it over and over)

Hope they will fix some of the problems and that it will fix the game.

While I enjoy the MadMax / Borderlands theme, W.E.D.S suffers from a lack of focus, or perhaps more accurately a lack of proper focus. The fun of this game comes from souping up your doomsday truck, but doing so doesn't necessarily propel you toward the end-game. Players must instead focus on completing objectives, making the most interesting and fun part of this game auxiliary. In practice, this game is about accelerating your economic engine. Pick up goods, sell goods, buy more room for goods, buy goods, sell goods, etc. Granted, this is expected from any pickup-and-deliver game, but W.E.D.S. focuses on this mechanic too strongly, thus downplaying its greatest aspects.

Not my normal style of game but this is a fun Amerithrash game with cool atmosphere.  There are multiple player characters with unique powers, multiple quests, and different factions of bad guys so there's a lot of variability. Set up and game play are both a little long but this is a fun game that's worth the time.

RATING: 9.5
Man, each time I play this game I like it more.  Even the one time that I got stomped, everyone immediately agreed that we wanted to play it again (and I won!) - that's just about the highest praise a game can get.

And it's not really that long for the game that it is.  It's a really nice blend of Ameritrash and a eurogame engine.  Many paths to vicotry but I love that it's not a point salad but it's the first to 3-missions win.  The right amount of hidden information and public information.  

I don't agree that there isn't player interaction.  Yes, you can't attack the other players.  But putting a raider in another players way can really mess up their plans.  No one will completely die in this game, but since this is a pick up and deliver game, one damage (which potentially forces you to reduce your cargo space and drop cargo!) can be really devastating.  Also, the market is manipulated by players and you WILL be racing each other to pick/deliver items to certain places.  This is not an option haha :D

My only knock against this game: not enough cards!  I am not sure why they didn't include more in the base game for pretty much everything!  Either just for more of the beautiful art, or adding serious replayability to events and missions.  

I am really wishing I had that promo pack...  An expansion would also be appreciated and some new characters would be great, but I don't see it happening and where would I put them?  The box is pretty tight.  The Gamer Trays is fantastic, but it's not a bonus, it's a necessity!

The more information I see on this the more convinced I am that I must have it.
Played a couple times already and so far I like it. The family not so much due to the length. But getting the wife and kids to sit for more than an hour playing a game is a feat in itself.
It's a game that will remain in my collection due to the theme alone. It is indeed a good game, and I thoroughly enjoy the mechanisms at play. The different approaches to success are great, and make for a varied game that is highly replayable.

I'm just not 100% sold on the gameplay just yet. It feels very slow for what it is, and it almost feels as though there should be more actions allowed per turn. It's tough putting my finger on the exact things at play that are preventing full enjoyment here.

I'm close to pinning it down to not enough actions per turn. If it was twice as many, the game would clip along at a good pace and be done within an hour. Right now, it feels it overstays its' welcome by about 30 minutes to an hour.

A very solid, albeit slow, and excellently themed pick-up-and-deliver.

Great theme, high component quality and great art mar a game that is simply way too long to play. With four players, three hours is the minimum time investment with the possibility for way more than that if you pull the wrong contracts. I liked it way more than my rating indicates, but the fact of the matter is if I was offered a chance to play it again, I'd probably pass in order to play two great games in the time it takes to play this one, average-to-good game. I don't think I would ever play this again with more than three players.

Played it, and it is pretty cool. I just feel a bit on lighter side, some extra tensions would be nice, otherwise wouldn't mind playing it from time to time. Also when I thought the game just begun, it was over. Still gotta explore it allot more to exactly know how it is.

It's SUPER intimidating for new players (who aren't major board game players). The turns proceed so quickly once you get the hang of it, but it's hard to get a reluctant player over that hump. It starts very slow but ramps up to a furious pace. Ultimately we loved everything about it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
First impression of this game based on an aborted 3+ hour play is that the mechanics and basic moving parts of the game are very fun and engaging, and keep the turn to turn play moving at a brisk pace. However, developing a strategy to gain victory points (and end the game) is difficult. The game does not hold your hand in this regard. We eventually figured out just how important it was to go digging for additional priority first class contracts (which reward vp) and not just rely on building up to the public ones, but that was too little too late for us. 
Hopefully, if we go back to play it again (I hope we do) the lesssons we learned last game will make the game a more satisfying and enjoyable experience. Will update when that happens. Until then the game is a collection of streamlined mechanics, evocative art, and exceptional themeing and "Chrome".

Great theming and storage system.  Unfortunately that appears to have consumed 90% of the effort.  It is multi-player (near) solitaire. Game balance seems off (raiding rules), the cards emphasize busy art to the detriment of playability.  Most cards have one line of important text.  It is the line you can't read from across the table.  A FAQ is sorely needed.  Never again.

The bitsplosion makes it look heavier than it actually is. In general, it can be fast-paced (just snap and growl at other truckers who give into AP and/or aren't planning their move when it's not their turn) and you can do a 5 player game in 2 hours.

Some further buffing on the cards would bump up the rating--if each player mat had a baked in sleeper cab and machine guns, there would be a clearer indication of your base stats. If the missions that require using the [OUTPUT] action said as much on their cards, rather than the nebulous "Deliver", that'd help. Unless some of them actually DO use the [DELIVER] action...

Some confusion also with "Purchase" meaning goods, NOT items from the shop, and the unfortunate lack of a * on the Escort/teleport card hinder easy explanation.

After a few plays I also find that the public quests don't seem entirely worth it (at least, not the Nuke One, the varied smuggling one, or the Vision Quest), not when you could keep scrounging for reliably easier smuggling quests from the deck.

Raiders at first seem super scary, but ultimately they're just a mildly inconvenient store, which works well for a sense of progression.

Some starting powers seem overpowered--a RAD shield at the start or an extra trailer seem much more powerful compared to "go slightly faster", especially since most moves either are

This game is pretty pure pick-up and deliver, and the rules do make that easy to do. I would not recommend playing with 4 or more players lightly, though, as the game bogs down a bit doing so. The "Narrative Campaign" falls a bit short of expectations: don't rush to this one if that's your main point of attraction. 

An otherwise very interesting game, with good level of randomness and theme. I'd see this as "a shorter, more to the point Firefly".

RATING: N/A
Fun pick-up and delivery game with Borderlands and Mad Max vibes. The double action mechanism means you get to do something productive each turn and the variety makes each game different. The campaign mode is weak, though, and there needs to be a mechanism that fixes the market when the supply and demand are all the same.

I really enjoy this game! Only 2 issues:
1) Rules are a bit vague at times. Mostly cleared up with FAQ/Forums. 

2) Decks are a bit thin. After only a couple plays, we've seen all the cards in the decks. Looking to add some custom/personal cards to shake things up.

The board is what makes it though. The variability of the modular board is great even for the objectives you do get. They change your priorities and change the game enough that we still love the game - despite the lack of deck size.

*painted minis under my gallery* Super thematic and full of character. The game has a nice sense of adventure.

Not so much pick up and deliver as "blow up and deliver." Tried playing it without combat - that was a mistake. Pretty much gotta get in there and fight. The dice can hate you for sure, but there's ways to mitigate them. Just searching decks for point-scoring cards is a but boring. Nice production values.

It's been a long time since I played a game that only lasted as long as players let it. The first player to fulfill three contracts wins. No Scoring. No Tie Breaks. It's just done.

There are some interesting elements to the game. The pick up and deliver is fairly vanilla, but the rest of the package is so flavorful that it outshines the core mechanism. 

So far, so good. I hope they expand the game.

I really was attracted to the theme of this game as I'm a huge Mad Max fan but I wasn't sure whether or not this would pair well with a pick up and deliver style game.  I'm glad my hesitations were uncalled for as this is one of my favorite games that I picked up in 2017.  The components in this game are great and I only have the retail edition as I missed out on the KS campaign.  The vehicle minis are well crafted, the game inserts are as nice as those included in Mechs vs Minions and are even used during the game as the entire mod shop insert is just placed near the game board with all the available chits ready for purchase.  The modular play board is made from thick cardboard and I don't suspect it will be prone to warping.  I would have liked to see minis in place of the faction standees but I'm guessing this was a KS exclusive if it was even offered.

There is a fair amount of humor worked into this game as they have pseudo-plagiarised material from a plethora of post-apocalyptic franchises.  Many of the depot locations in the game share similar names to places from the Walking Dead or Mad Max and there is even a Burt Reynolds esque faction called The Bandit that drives a decked out trans am.

Variability between games is great due to the modular board setup so depot locations as well as the distances between them will never be the same twice.  Selecting 3 random Priority First Class Contracts (end game conditions) each time also makes gameplay much more random however I've noticed that some of these contracts are significantly more difficult and time consuming to complete than others.  Every time I have played this game, the winner has completed at least 1 secret Priority First Class contract that they acquired from a faction deck.

Game play is great and often comes down to choosing between modding your vehicle to provide greater benefits or trying to complete a delivery that will get you closer to victory while.  Spending too much time at the mod shop will give you a sweet ride but will significantly set you back in time if the other players have been focusing on making mostly deliveries.  

One of the common complaints I have heard regarding this game is that the play time runs for longer than a pick up and deliver type game should.  Most of our games have lasted between 2 to 2.5 hours however in each of these games, the winner completed at least 1 secret Priority First Class contract which helped reduce the game time.

I've also heard people say that some of the artwork is questionable as some of the raiders outfits don't leave much to the imagination.  I personally don't mind this at all and find it compliments the theme of the game quite nicely.

I would have liked to see more player interaction as you aren't able to attack and raid your fellow players.  The only real interaction comes from sending the raiders to ambush your opponents which often times isn't very detrimental if they have already made a few mods to their vehicle.  Early game this is a viable option but later in the game it doesn't accomplish much.

Overall, this game is great and is a must buy for anyone who is a fan of Mad Max.  Component quality is great, the included insert is straight up amazing, and game play is always fun and rewarding.

I fell in love with this game last year when I saw a Gen Con preview video, and have followed it on and off ever since. Was really pleased to finally buy it and crack it open t'other day - great miniatures, excellent box and storage tray design, and an enjoyable game to boot.

Strongly themed, our first play of this game was enjoyed by all players, although the lack of direct player interaction means there is a risk that players play the game 'in a vacuum' -- I'm  a little more lively and exuberant than most, so still enjoyed the whole experience.

The only other downside was that once a player was on the way to completing their last mission to win the game, there was no real way of stopping them or holding them up...  I've already got a workaround for this, but it's probably not ideal...

Nice game, though, and great experience, so looking forward to playing it some more.

Enjoyable pickup and deliver game in the same style as Firefly and Merchants and Marauders. Unfortunately I think I prefer both of those games over this one. WEDS is definitely more casual, but it also lacks focus. There are tons of things you can do in game, but you're really just trying to complete the central missions. This is a very streamlined design, though I think it could have benefited from more thematic elements, as the theme almost feels pasted on. It's not bad for what it is, but this didn't come anywhere close to replacing Firefly for me.

Excellent! It is was presented as similar to Merchants and Marauders, which I initially found to be scary. I liked the merchant part, but one player marauding took 10 minutes while my merchant actions took a few seconds, with multiple turns planned ahead. Fortunately, Wasteland Express allowed for almost all turns to be pretty quick, and was set with  a favorite theme of mine that connects well with  the game play. 

Overall after the rules were explained, it quickly made sense after the first few turns.. The edition I played would benefit greatly from a handout and a few clarifications, but I was told that was being addressed in the next printing. 

I am a little worried about the "image" of the game. I play a wide range of euro and amerithrash games, but fewer people in my crowd will play games heavy on the amerithrash side, especially ultra-violent-ish games (Zombicide is one I seldom see around). Games like Road Kill Rally are challenging enough to get to the table, but it is a bit more cartoon-ish  than Wasteland, which makes it easier to get the game to the table. The game mechanics are a great mix of the two game types, but the images make it appear more on the ameritrash side, which may limit the likelihood that it will make it to the table with many of my regular gaming buddies. 

Overall  I enjoyed the game, with a 3-player game (2 new players) taking about 2 hours to play after explanation and ended with a close finish. The game went at a good solid pace, with no one aching for it to end. The cost for it's extra glamour is also a bit off-putting, though decadent pricey games like Scythe and Terraforming Mars seem to  be working lately. I will probably end up getting this game, and hopefully I can convince gaming buddies to join in.

Wasteland Express Delivery Service is a pick-up-and-deliver game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.  Players move their trucks around to various outposts on the board, where they could buy goods, sell goods, or upgrade their truck in a number of ways.  The object of the game is to complete three public goals; however, players can draw cards that may be able to be substituted for those goals.  There's an action system that constrains what you can do in a round, making it essential to plan things out right.  There is some luck involved in the game, with card draws and dice-based player-vs-game combat.  I'm favorably inclined toward pick-up-and-deliver, though, and really enjoyed this one.

Fun game with excellent components and art work (except for the stickers on the raider trucks..). 
Not much direct interaction (even with Full Violence option!), but the pace is fast so there's little downtime. What I especially like is that supply and demand  change with every pickup/delivery so you have to be very flexible (or lucky). 
Minor quibbles : ALL allies suck, should have been left out. The events are often rather feeble, I would expect more mayhem in the Wastelands. Missiles should have been limited to 3 per truck, or made more expensive, or take up 2 cargo spaces.  
I expect that different missions really change the game so select them well.

Now I've only had one play of this one. And let me just say my pick up and delivery experience is this one and one game of Firefly. So I may not even know what a good pickup and delivery game is, but I'm going to give my two sense anyways. Firefly is too lucky and takes about 4 hours. Wasteland express mitigates some of the luck and takes 2 hours. End of story. I enjoyed Wasteland Express much more than Firefly and would be willing to play his one anytime someone pulled it out. With preferably three players who have played before. The game isn't really worth 3 hours to me. That being said, I probably won't buy it because I am still not in love with it, and I rarely get to play games with more than two. This one seems like it needs three to be best. The inserts in this one are amazing though. Great production. Give it a shot, even if you have tried some longer pick up delivery games, and thought you don't like the mechanic. I enjoyed this one quite a bit.

Solid pick-up-and deliver.  Plays pretty quickly.  Even with the trays, it's a pretty hungry table hog.  There are some parts of it that definitely seem like they could be improved like combat, which seems a bit too simple.  It's fun, though, and is more accessible than Merchants & Marauders, but won't be replacing that one.  I also recommend using the variant where you can't start with a priority faction job and you can only complete one of those during the game, to emphasize the public jobs. 
I was also a fan of how close the game was for a race-type game.  Just feels like there is something missing.

This is a pickup and delivery game set in a post-apocalyptic world. The board layout is randomly constructed, including supply and demand locations for several types of goods. Every time you make a purchase or sale, the supply/demand (respectively) randomly changes to something else. You do all of this by using a cool action point system, most points being spent for movement (so hopefully there's no real AP here). There's also combat with the raiders (3 trucks roaming the board, 4 fixed outposts) which can get you resources as well. You earn cash, which you can spend to improve your truck (more capacity, better attack/defense/other abilities). The actual win condition, though, is to fulfill 3 contracts (you start with some in hand and can acquire more during the game) -- it's a race! 

The production is absolutely gorgeous. The art is pretty good, I suppose, but the inserts are pure genius! On the other hand, the font is so small that anyone not sitting right next to the card or item or tray can't read any damn thing! The game, at least with four newbies, also took way too long and was way too random. I prefer a more logistical type of pickup and deliver (like Merchants of Venus, for example) with less random stuff (dice rolls, card flips, supply and demand changing constantly). I'd probably be willing to try it again, maybe with just 2 or 3 players, but I won't be seeking this out myself (and the others just HATED it!).

Pick up and deliver game with a post apocalyptic theme. The components and inserts that came with the game are great quality! The art/graphic design fit the theme well! Besides these points, I just thought it was just an okay game at best. At times it was very fiddly and random with having to change the little cardboard chits on a location after it has been used. I didn't like that the missions were rather random, so it wasn't beneficial to build your character to be good in just one area. The difficulty of the enemy factions also varied greatly! The events also just negatively added to the randomness of the game. I would prefer Istanbul or Yokohama to this as these do not suffer with the type of randomness that is found in this game.

This game sets the bar high for efficient, effective, and cost-sensible storage. Great value, great game. Other publishers should take note and follow their lead!

Has lots of similarities to Firefly the Game, but perhaps with a bit of streamlining. It is long and repetitious. The randomness of the tiles and cards is frustrating as you may have to spend a lot of time traveling around the board or taking sub-optimal actions just to have something to do.

Fun pickup and deliver game with a cool theme.  First 3 player game was 3.5 hours.  Great components and storage trays.  It does have a lot of setup and takedown time.

Love this game. The every changing marketplace and modular board means every game is a little different. While setup looks a little daunting, the actual gameplay is surprisingly simple, yet has plenty of depth as you have to plan out your actions, and use the momentum mechanic wisely to optimize your actions.

Wasteland Express Delivery Service is a serviceable — and outrageously handsome — game of delivery, raiding, and modding your rig to the gills. It misses a few crucial beats in service of simplicity, and will likely appeal to those who haven't experienced better-rounded fare like Merchants & Marauders. Still, it's not a bad game by any means, just a missed opportunity or two.

Only played once so far but we enjoyed it so much. In the game we played two people were racing to complete the final contract. The gameplay is simple to learn but I think it will be hard to master.

Shame this game is beautiful.  But it's poorly designed combat completely negates any other aspect of the game because to do them is inferior to just constantly attacking the raiders.  

Maybe with some rule tweaks it'd be better.  But i don't have time for fixing other peoples games.

Only one game under my belt so far.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, definitely feels heavily on the Euro side, even taking damage feels like a resource.  Fun, race-like feel with a definite arch to it as you start the first half of the game making a few deliveries and gearing up your rig, the second half is the race towards victory missions.  It has a nice pacing to turns if everyone is focused, but the game still goes long.

What stops it from being an amazing top 20 game for me, and makes it more of an occasional game, is you never feel like you're in a living world.  It feels very mechanical, buy things there, sell things there, plan efficiently.  The factions could be whatever, the enemy trucks aren't a threat.  For all of it's flaws, Merchants and Marauders at least felt like you were in a world at war with ports changing allegiance, countries battling, big imposing ships chase you, quests were actually things you wanted to read.  All of that gets trimmed down to a card flip and a die roll in WEDS.

Components are pretty spectacular, particularly the GameTrayz inserts. Set up is a bit fiddly but the game is pretty smooth and fun. Interaction is pretty minimal, consisting of just beating other people to opportunities for scoring or making money. If you're just looking at driving around the desert beating up raiders and selling stuff, look no further.

RATING: 3
Pretty bad game. The missions are 75% the same mission with slightly different rewards, there are only like 3 types of allies in the deck, and the events just slow the game way down for everyone

The worst part of the game though is the fact that everyone had to do every aspect of the game. You can only pillage bad guys one time per round. Why? Because the game says so. You can only purchase goods from stores once a round no matter how many you visit. Why? Because the game says so. There is no being good at something and taking that route to winning because you have to do all of the aspects of the game every round or you won't win.

Don't waste your money, get Xia instead

Post-apocalyptic comic styled standees pick-up-and-deliver Ameri-trasher. Far out, and by far out I mean way out there. I will never look at parcel delivery service the same way again.  This will be a cult classic if it isn't already.

**Updated impressions after a couple of plays**

The game certainly has some amazing components and art, and the insert is fantastic.

The gameplay ends up being a solid mix of executing delivery jobs, interacting with the economy, managing your inventory, improving your truck and also a bit of combat (against AI characters).

I like how the faction jobs and events tie into the overall "story" and lore of the world, and some of the events definitely made people change strategies or punished them for not hedging their bets a bit.

The rulebook isn't great. That's a con. Also, small text on the cards is problematic. Lots of small chits and pieces, and just kind of a lot going on.

Our second play had to be called early, as we played with five players, and it still wasn't done after 3+ hours of playing. There was probably still an hour or more left. The game is definitely not great for distracted or AP players. I'd probably never play with five again.

All that said, there is a cool game here. If you get the right group who knows the game or who is engaged, and you have the time, the theme and game do present themselves fairly well. I think I'll just have to be more strategic with how and when I play it.

RATING: 8.1
Early rating based on 2p game. One major con I have is that I really dislike "get x stars/goals/missions done" -ending type of games, I prefer a set amount of turns or point salad scoring. This sudden, abrupt ending happens with Scythe, Viticulture and also sadly with WEDS. 

Still the game looks great, love the art, love the gearbox action selection thing.. Turns are usually quick and smooth. The money ramped up really fast to both of our surprise and we didn't have almost any trouble with the raiders. Have to rereview the rulebook so that we played correctly.

Amazing stuff for an amazing pick and delivery game. A little bit long for 5 players but the flow is always good (one action each turn, five turns for a round : perfect if players play fast).
Some people complains about low interaction but you can play with the Full Violence variant.
Everything is great : modular board, miniatures, clear rules, incredible trays in the box, theme, gameplay and a lot of fun.
Ideal game after Outlive for post-apo night :)

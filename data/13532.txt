Absolutely love the OCS system.   Play this system more than any other.  Played GB II the opening full map 20 turn scenario twice.   Now on my way for a 3rd time a year later.  So many tough decisions.  TBL and GB II are my favorites of the OCS system.  But all are winners.  So many hours of gaming pleasure.

RATING: 3
Terrible balance and not fully playtested.  Classic monstergame problem.  Fun system but falls down when played by gamers out for blood.  Too bad - such promise! Gotta be the game with the longest setup I have ever played...took a full day to just set the thing up.  Then, on the third turn (10.5 days into the campaign), the Germans entered Moscow...it took only a little less time to put away.

RATING: 8.5
The eastern front really shows the beauty of the system when representing a small higher quality force attacking a much larger but mismatched foe (in terms of quality). When playing more evenly matched forces OCS seems heavily stacked in favour of the defender. However I still find the more unusual theatres the more interesting ie Burma and Korea though.

I finally got up the nerve to solitaire the whole thing. I don't have a big enough table for all the maps to be set up contiguously. But I improvised. This is, pure and simple, the most full immersion solitaire gaming experience I have ever had. I am inching up my rating from 9 to 9.5...

RATING: N/A
OCS series game. I'm not really an East Front gamer, but this looks pretty good. Think I'd prefer to play the Axis as the Russians will probably just act as speed bumps for majority of the game. Has 'bark soup' counters for hungry and pocketed Russkies..

I love OCS all of them. Having said that this is the one I keep going back to the most. Playing this combined with Case Blue in a 6 player game was the best wargaming experience I've had in my over 45 years of wargaming!

GDII is an excellent update of the original GD, and in my view is an excellent, tense, see-saw battle. The Axis starts on offense; runs out of gas likely; the Soviets counter-attack; they are fought to a stop; the Axis get another offense in spring 1942; then over to the Soviets again. As someone else says here it's a deeply-immersive solitaire game. the fact that you can only play a turn per session is helpful -- you forget what's in the "opponent"s stacks! I have it set up right now and find a layer of plastic on the maps helpful -- i've been marking corps boundaries and supply/trace lines in dry ink, helping to keep things neat (an essential pre-requisite to surviving the supply system).

Do you need to read another rave about the OCS system? Or about the quality of components, clarity of rules, depth of the play system? No, you don't. But this would be all that if I was to write it. I'll never play another WW2 operational system again.

RATING: 6
UPDATE: I re-aquired GBII. Haven't played it again though :)
---
OK, well, with the release of Case Blue, I've had to reconsider my rating. I would play GBII again, but the conditions are somewhat constrained: I wouldn't play the 1941 game again unless it was the winter counter-offensive. I wouldn't play the '42 German Fantasy drive on Moscow again. I'd play something in '42 or '43 where the Soviets get to do some attacking. I'd play something smaller.

Anyway. I find myself sort of hunting (half-heartedly) for a copy to go with my Case Blue, embarrassing since I sold by GB II off a couple years ago (although I got a lot for it, so it'll probably be a wash if I eventually find another one). Sort of kicking myself for selling it now. But it does have a lot of issues.
---
UPDATE: I've knocked down (way down) my rating on GBII just due to the practical impossibility of actually playing it sensibly. The core problem here is that the game requires 6 players to manage the huge amount of front line and numbers of units. But the supply is only sufficient for maybe 1.5 German players to really do anything. So too many people sit around for too long (days!) with nothing to do. And the game will take many, many, many days to play.

This could all be mitigated with a decent selection of smaller scenarios, so you can play something without the insanity. But the smaller scenario are obviously just thrown together, and there is nothing both sensibly-sized and appealing. This is a real killer.

So even though I love OCS as a system, GBII gets a low rating due to sheer unplayability. I'll stick with Burma, DAK, and Korea. The 3 sounds really harsh to me, but as per the guidelines that's the "I wouldn't play it again" level, so there you go.

---

Get GBII, not the original; GBII is a complete overhaul and much improved. Great game, great system, but before you crack it open you have to realise this is a big game. And when I say big, we're talking *huge* here. I tried to play just the Typhoon portion of the game, and while it's great, we played an entire long weekend at a con and got about halfway through. I'd love to finish that game out, but I just can't see investing the time to play the whole thing given I enjoy other games too. The shortage of decent, smaller scenarios is a real problem. This really is the pinnacle of the OCS system, though; if you're going to play a WWII game that sucks down a hundred hours or so, this would be the one to play. Now it should be said, there are imbalances that should be fixed; the Soviets have much too hard a time replacing infantry, I think. Then again, most wargamers are not good at playing the Soviets.

OCS gets too ambitious. The campaign is flawed by being too long for OCS to handle (unit fatigue isn't taken into specific account, and most players are too aggressive to have any realistic chance of making it all the way through), and the game flawed by having insufficient scenarios.

Nevertheless, this is still one of the best systems for portraying this level of WWII combat, and there's plenty of value in this package. Just not the best OCS game out there (by any means).

Updated (07/01)
Started the 1942 "What if" campaign at a convention in Lyon (France) : we were 3 on the soviet side against 2 on the german side. What a blast ! It's huge but fun to play.

2011 version.  I would rate this game higher, but after finally getting hip-deep into this system, and feeling as if I actually understand it, I find myself somewhat depressed that it all turns out to be a bit much of an "efficiency engine", wherein you try to get the most done with the fewest units, leaving 70%-90% of the forces you spent time setting up doing little or nothing.

Require a team of 4 or 5 to be properly played. The only problem (when it comes to team play) is that only a fraction of the front is active every turn meaning that most team members will not have that much fun. In my opinion, case blue gives a much better team experience

RATING: 4
Tentative rating after four hours or so of actual play. Not likely I'll ever play this again but you never know.

I have heard many great things about the OCS system but when I finally got to try it out I must admit I was quite disappointed. Perhaps my rating is harsh, but a game where it takes several hours for one player to make his move in an introductory scenario is simply not a game I'll ever appreciate. The low level of player interaction doesn't appeal to me either. Apart from the occasional FlaK roll there not much to do for the other player.

So all in all, thanks for the ride but please drop me off at the next stop.

Wow, what a monster! After 6 hours of play we made it through 2 turns and my head hurt. The OCS mechanics are manageable, but managing the game is tough. It really captures the flavor of dealing at the operational level and controlling troops and supply. Definitely glad I played it but this is a beast to get to the table and play.

This 2011 OCS remake takes you as close to Moscow as you think you can get while struggling to fend off one assault after another. A well packed game remake that both updates and improves the original. Incredible fun and what you come to expect of the OCS series of games. Personally I don't care for HQ's acting as engineers, and find the lack of a separation in supply types (fuel/Ammo) causes more problems than one generic supply type solves. The game scale is out of sync and the maps could use a bit more effort as they are too bland and generic. A game I recommend both as an educational tool and to play just for the joy of it.

In some ways this is even more interesting than Case Blue, since you have the focus on Moscow (the ultimate East front objective).  The period from October 1941 to April 1942 presents the first turning point in the East; the rest of the coverage is just a bonus (and not as compelling unless you're also playing Case Blue).

It appears that there might be some major balance problems with the initial Axis assault being far more lethal than was historically the case.  Nevertheless this is OCS for real men and will ultimately be extended to cover all the major fighting from late 1941 to 1943(?)

The main draw for me is the scenario covering the Soviet winter offensive as this is an area seldom simulated at the operational level.

Just getting into the Typhoon scenario.  I thought Drive for Oil (from Case Blue) and the Baltic Gap campaign were pretty epic.  This makes them look like sideshows.  I keep losing count of the German tank and motorised infantry divisions.  A great asymmetrical battle between surgical strike power (on the German side:  lots of AR5 units, backed by hipshooting Stukas and an effectively unlimited supply of reserve markers) and numbers (on the Soviet side:  lots of 12-2-2 infantry divisions and poor quality tank brigades - well supplied in good terrain).

This is imposing and hard - simple rules, but hard choices:  shallow encirclements to advance in an orderly well-supplied fashion; all out deep operations on a shoestring; or a combination.  So many choices it is mind boggling.  Each move is a major undertaking - particularly in the early going.  But the time flies by because it is an immensely satisfying challenge.

Updated 16 June 2010:  After eight and a half months real time--only two and a half months game time!--we have packed up our combined GBII/CB scenario, which we had been playing with 2-3 players per side.  I really like many aspects of OCS as a system, but I find that I prefer the smaller OCS games like Korea.  In our current game, even with three of us covering the German side, the sheer scale of the project has gotten to be overwhelming--too much info to process, too many decisions, too many opportunities for mistakes simply through forgetfulness or pressure to keep things moving.  Maybe if there were more of us covering each side this monster scenario might be manageable, but getting that many OCS players in this area who are prepared and able to make the time commitment has not proved to be a do-able proposition.

Better than the original in almost every way.  This is one OCS title that definitely needed to be reissued and GBII really is more fun to play than the original.  I think the major revision the system went through from version 1.0 to 2.0 and then 3.0 just made GB components out of date.  Plus they added the northern part of the battlefield significantly sweetening the deal.

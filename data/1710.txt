RATING: 1
Laughably ahistorical - and the designers tell you it is in the opening of their notes!: they purposely ignore everything Josephus has to say!?!  And then there are the late ancient / early medieval siege weapons -- the bad jokes pile up so fast you need wings to stay above it....
Therefore, normally I would have rated this a 5.5 for being a great simulation of a Generic late ancient / early medieval siege; but there are plenty of excellent generic siege simulators out there: I didn't need one masquerading as THE 70AD siege of Jerusalem.

You might call this game "Cohort Leader" or "Warband Leader." This is a monster covering the siege of Jerusalem in the truest sense of the word. Hexes are 50 meters and cover the entire ancient city. Three counters make up a cohort. 10 cohorts represent the heavy infantry of a legion. Then add in the legions artillery (10 pieces), cavalry (6 pieces), towers and rams (5 pieces), Vilitae (10 pieces) and slingers and bowmen (10 pieces or so). So 270 or so counters on the table at once for the Romans and nearly as many for the Judeans. Each turn represents about an hour of daylight and evening hours. 

It's as big an undertaking as playing the ASL module Red Barricades or Festung Budapest. You could easily spend 12 hours playing out each assault phase. And there are five of them to get through.

It's a mountain that's mighty steep for a person to commit to. If it were a flat-land battle, it would be one thing, but the plethora and panoply of walls, seige equipment, artillery, and troops make for a dense and complex rulebook.

It will reward the afficianado dedicated to playing such things. But even the most dedicated grognard will find it tough going. If you want a "lost weekend" (even a long one) of gaming, look no further.

My one game was fun, but it was a long day of gaming. As a newbie Roman handling but two of the four legions, I lost a lot of troops before our side could declare victory for the first assault phase. 

It's the sort of game that after you play through it once, you've felt like you've played as much as you ever want to play of it again.

Refined version originally designed by Historical Persectives (both versions are good). This game is the historically underappreciated prequel battle to Masada...the few survivors from Jerusalem fled to the mountain fortress (the escape is covered in the game).  The Map is huge, so you will need all of a very large table. Game is suprisingly playable with interesting components.  Rules are well done and easy to digest.  The Romans are under tremendous pressure to take the city in time, which requires the Roman player to be organized and relentless, exactly as they were in the actual campaign. Very intense game, with some interesting decisions to be made as to how to crack the Jerusalem nut. Has wonderful epic Cecil B Demille feel.  Excellent city assault game with mining, ramp building and siege engines. Contains some of the most pitched fighting you will find in any cardboard battle. One of the most underrated wargames of all time. This works well solo.

I played 6 complete campaigns, two, three and four players. This game is VERY complex and you better find someone teaching it to you. The feelings are great. The ebbs and flows of a siege are in this game. For me it&#039;s also very important that you can pack it up at the end of every siege period. This means you can play a monster game even if you don&#039;t have the space to let it set up (you can complete an assault in a long afternoon)

Had the original and loved it, lent it to a friend and got ruined in a flood.  Had to buy the second edition.  (caveat:  most of my plays were with the first edition).

Great map - though the first edition had its own charms, and find the Avalon Hill rules much denser than the original.  

Still, a great game I would love to play again.

The original, large-scale siege game.  Boiling oil, ballistae, siege towers, centuries forming into testudo, fighting in the streets of the city - it's all here.  The rules are not well-organizaed (or necessary well-explained, either), but it's all relatively errata-free.

Complejo y muy largo juego que recrea un famoso asedio en tiempos de los romanos.

La idea y los componentes son atractivos (hay catapultas, torres de asalto, calderos de aceite...!), pero no es muy realista pensar en jugarlo, por su complejidad y duración.

The single, large map is beautiful. Why don't more game companies do this? The counters and player aids could use a touch up, though.

Played a turn or two of the intro scenario. Seems relatively fun, but I do think the Romans are going to be far too abused to actually win the full game.

Update: After completing one full assault period and getting through half the second assault period, feelings are mixed. On the one hand I really love the topic and the map is gorgeous. You get to make the Romans man the towers, push them up to the wall and then bash their way onto it. All while suffering a hail of missile fire and rocks as you batter down the gate. It's definitely thematic.

On the other hand, the missile fire effects versus heavy infantry feel massively overrated and ahistorical, and you can end up with a sort of Napoleonic grand battery effect at times. This results in excessive Roman casualties that almost always create a Judean victory in the long game, unless the Roman player gets lucky with the mining rolls. Not that you would know, because playing the full game requires a massive amount of playing time, probably 7-12 hours per assault period, and there are five assault periods. This just isn't practical, even for people who enjoy larger games. Additionally, it can become especially boring for the Judean player who is often just going through the same robotic motions while the Roman player has all the fun.

Anyway, a game with questionable historical accuracy and extreme playing time that might be good for folks with heavy historical interest, but everyone else should avoid.

This is a demanding game: space, time, involvement. But what a pleasure to play, both strategically and tactically. 

In fact each assault should not last this long: often the Roman player should seek to end it as soon as possible with the least loss possible. 

Narrative is excellent and very fun. Still the game goes faster with 6 players, 4 Romans and 2 Jews.

RATING: 7.5
The map is big and awesome. It portrays the whole city divided in sectors, as it might have looked in classical period having Herod’s palace, the Hippodrome and the most significant edifice, the Temple. The game rules are enough to read but straightforward. The Roman player commands 4 Legions and gets the task of conquering hex by hex the whole map. The siege comes complete with ramps, mining shafts, boiling cauldrons, catapults, ballista, testudo, siege towers and rams. The game play has a lot of planning and action for both sides. It has an introductory scenario and a campaign. The campaign lasts after 5 assault periods. Every assault period lasts a whole day. The game runs smooth on the first two sectors of the city. The third assault period (the Temple area) gets stalled. It is really a quiz of how you can conquer this part of the town. Time is pressing for the Roman and a luxury for the Judean player. Nice challenge.

An interesting and playable monster game. One of the most gorgeous maps of all time. Some short, manageable scenarios also exist (including a couple post-production add-ons). It has stood the test of time to remain an enjoyable game, despite its age. Not too shabby as a simulation, either.

A friend of mine won this in a drawing at our FLGS in 1994 or thereabouts.  We took one look at the rules and decided that it's so ridiculously complex that it wasn't worth trying to figure out.  It's now become a standard joke for the "What do you want to play?" question.

One of the best wargames ever.  While the campaign game is long, each of the scenarios is interesting and playable.  The campaign game is remarkable for a siege game because you have real options about which wall and which section of the wall you will attack next.

My favorite ancients game of all time--still.  Tremendous dilemma facing the Roman regarding how much time to prepare assaults versus how many assaults he can mount over the course of the siege.  It's a tricky balance.  Color and "feel" is perfect.  Can't recommend this enough--get a copy and play it!

Untill today I have not found any person who has ben able of finishing a long scenario for this game. Old estyle AH game (hundreds of tokens, hundreds of rules, big map, many options...) ready for a ten hours game in a big table.

Looks like a great wargame, if you are retired, unemployed, or a complete geek - the length of play, however, only made it possible for us to play the Introductionary scenario.

Based upon 2 solo plays and a single 1/2 game vs an opponent.  Nice detail and a great wargame of ancient seige warfare in a box with great Avalon Hill componets that would cost well over $100 today.

one-of-a-kind subject, strategy for the Romans can become a lifestyle.  the rulebook is well written, but not very enlightening about what you should be doing; see the excellent session reports and strategy articles on BGG for that.  Play is very streamlined and easy once you get your mind around it.  However, the campaign is very big and very long.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wonderful map.  The combat system is quite complex, this is not an simple game. Siege warfare at his best with towers, ramp, archers, catapults, rams and hot oil falling on the Romans. Never have the chance to complete a game but I will never sell this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The game looks great once set up.  However, my main concern having played it 3-4 times when the AH version came out is that it is not much fun for the Jewish player in the early phases of the game.  You will feel like a target for the Roman siege artillery.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Boring, Roman player, if your units without the ram covered move within 2 hexe of wall the units were dead.

Day 1, Northern wall, using all the 4 ram try to destory as much as possible walls, The whole army wait at 5 hexe from the wall to be out of missile range, ALL the artillery concentrated to kill whatever up at the wall. When night turn comes, charge in kill as many Jedwish as possible. I repeated this tactic 3 days, my opponent and me were killed by the game......Boring...

Reasonable simulation of an ultra-cool subject. Has the coolest map I've ever seen in a wargame. Unfortunately as a game it has a couple of points against it. Primarily, the playing time.

A game I played much in my youth. Fantastic looking map of Jerusalem; great sense of Roman tactical combat with the works: siege engines, walls, fortresses, artillery, cavalry, cauldrons, and numerous different unit types. While it has short scenarios the campaign is time consuming and the rules are moderately complex and by modern game standards "old school". Nonetheless, a thoroughly enjoyable experience.

If a game is going to be a &quot;tweezer game&quot; (need to use tweezers to pick up the counters), then it needs to shine in the fun department.  Otherwise, playing the game feels like work instead of play.  This one is work for me.  I&#039;m usually all for more units, but in this case I think a lower unit density would have worked better.

My third favorite game behind Empires in Arms and World in Flames.  The amount of carnage is unbelievable, and it is an incredible simulation of siege warfare, something I have not seen done anywhere else.  Beautiful map too.

Also has the unique aspect where after each 'assault phase', you take all the counters of the map and then reset up your units for the next phase.  This allows you to not have to keep the game set up in between phases.  Variable endings too.  Cannot find a flaw in this game.

The components still look great after all these years - the map is so gorgeous that you might hang it on the wall. Caveat ist, as with most of the monster games, the downtime for the non-phasing player. One is active while planning and moving, the other one is just called to the table to fight. 
Solitaire playability is slightly impaired, because then the judaean player will know exactly where "surprise" legions are going to attack, and where the mines are dug. Can be countered by placing the legions on board. By the way - you will need a HUGE table for this one - the map is usable as a bedsheet if you need one...

Definitely one of the best siege games out there with a stunning map of the city.  The game play, while tedious at times due to the sheer number of units, makes for some interesting decisions on attack and defense.

Excellent Siege game with a good campaign - as the Roman you can really feel the pressure the Senat is putting on you! Could have a better combat system, though

Just acquired from a website.  Paid a bit much for it, and the box is crushed, and I am not sure there is much chance to play because it is about six hours, but always wanted to have a good look at it, so here is my chance.

Great map, great situation.  Take a long time to play, 10-30 hours.  Rules are tricky.  Good with 3 or 4 players.  Would still work with 2 or 5 players.  Each battle takes 5-6 hours.  Epic.

Siege of Jerusalem literally adds a dimension to the common war games. It's an epic war simulation where where the invincible Roman armies are faced with impregnable walls around Jerusalem. The game is spiced with "wall elements" like siege machines, ladders and boiling oil but unfortunately the increased complexity of this third dimension leaves a bitter aftertaste. For those who don't dare this, Siege of Jerusalem offers many exciting challenges. 

Update: Sold because the game was simply too long and complex to ever get to the table.

The game seems very balanced and each side has lots of options.  At first I loved the game but I have to lower the rating because of downtime - there is too much of the "old" feel of sit around and wait for the other player to take their (long) turn.  There are a lot of units to move around, which seems a little tedious.  If I am going to play a game this long I would rather play something more interactive like Republic of Rome, Revolution: The Dutch Revolt or Civlization.

Learning the rules requires real effort.  Very long and very detailed: infantry, archers, calvary, support troops, command control, mining, artillery, siege engines, morale, testudo, friendly fire, night turns, sorties and more are covered.  Huge colourful map and lots of units.  Roman player has tremendous pressure to take the city section by section as quickly as possible, Jews fighting desparately for their lives and freedom.  Some anxious decision making on both sides.

A truly splendid game.  Played to completion once (over several days), with 4 Roman (one per legion) and 2 Judean players - the Judeans just managed a hang on to a victory - tense and exciting; would get a higher rating if it didn't take so long to play through to completion!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Tentative rating after playing the Introductory scenario: The Assault of Gallus in 66 AD.

The map is very beautiful and can be considered truly exceptional, considering its age!

Historical victory for the Judeans: One Legion is clearly not enough to assault Jerusalem, with so many Judean units defending it!

With only one D6, the combat tables show their age, but the system globally works and keep both players sweating for the next DR. LOL!

I anticipate at least 4 players to play the full siege, but it is definitely a game to play for anyone interested in Ancients!

Beautiful theme, great map, nice rules....all is set for a great gaming experience.

Then you realise there is almost no movement, it is really a siege game that goes on and on...there were only a few scenarios and even the smallest took us an entire weekend.

Why anyone would play the entire siege....no idea.

RATING: 6
Large and long hex and counter game which is interesting to play, but does drag on a bit. A friend showed how you could arrnage the Romen artillery to get auto-kills and again it suffered from having one main scenario which took seven sessions to play. As my friend had one anyway I sold off mine.

I love ancients and that one looked so promising, the map is beautiful, the counters functional, the rules not overwhelmig.

But we never got that one going to be finished because:

1) The scale is off for playability. 98% of the map is empty while the rest, where the action is going on, suffers from insane counter-density. Stacking and small hexes make the map and the terrain disappear and doing stuff a matter of delicate surgery-like manipulation.
The hexes are simply too small - that sucks out the fun turning it into work.

2) Not much moving, but perparing, then some storm and lots of Close Combat once breaches take place. That is to be expected, this is a huge siege, but need it to be felt like one in real-time? It's insanely long, not much moving around, just endless attention handling to a point to be just boring. 

Given that terrain and time scale would have been better handled, this could have been a great love, so it's a case of failed love. Sadly!

This, with the possible exception of Magic, was my most-played game for about a year (1995-96, for anyone who's counting).  Epic siege battle with lots of flavor and two very different experiences for the two sides.  The big problem with the game is that the Romans are an extreme longshot to win, but that is compensated for to some extent by the fact that they're much more fun to PLAY.

Another problem--the game is loooong.  It can be easy to record between Assault Phases, however (just record wall damage/control/Roman weeks of sieging and keep your casualties separate from your remaining units) and this breaks the game down into manageable 4-6 hour chunks.

Used to work on the offshore rigs in the Gulf of Mexico.  Specialized wireline work so our stay was one to three days.  One time I brought my SoJ game and boom on the first day, we on the rig for 8 days. We only worked two of the eight days, the other 6 days were free time.  Dont spend your money all in one place. Space is at a premium on a rig. I set the game up on my bunk and solitaired the bejesus out of that game. Slept for the eight days on the floor of our little wireline control room of sorts.

This is one of the most intense games I know. Because of the igo-hugo game system and bloody combat system, each side can expect a total roller coaster ride of emotions -- when it's your turn you're thinking "I'm winning, I'm winning, I'm winning! Whee!" And then your opponent takes his go and it's "I'm doomed, I'm doomed, flee, save yourselves." Great stuff.

Easier to start playing than the rules might make you think, there's a simple core of rules with a load of special cases. But personally I did find the step up from the Introductory scenario to the full campaign game a bit daunting - even in the first assault period, the masses of additional troops made things very hard for the Romans! Quite easy to play solo though, after initial placement there's no hidden movement or secret choices to make.

Finally tracked down a nice copy of this.  I had been looking for a detailed siege game and this fully met my expectations.  Everything you could want is here - cauldrons, catapults, siege towers, rams, multiple walls and bastions.  If you are looking for an epic siege game, this is it.  Very brutal and deadly.  Incredible tactical game.  Campaign game is loong, but worth it.

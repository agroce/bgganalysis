My fav game of all-time.  Extremely replayable and interesting and tense even in a blow-out.  Variable turn length (over 7 turns), the great equalizer of uncommon but significant weather changes that let the defending side attack, and play that rewards good operational sense all add to the fun.

Got a beautiful shrink wrapped copy of this of ebay to add to my pile of Normandy games. Basic game is first week of the invasion. The rules around bridges I have found hard to grasp but its a beautiful package and can hold its head graphically against many games 20 years on.

RATING: 6
Difficult rules, wrong system, questionable history and almost entirely abstract combat. Suffers badly from "forgotten front" syndrome, where the troops may be lying in the surf on Omaha for a week if more things are happening in more interesting places, like Caen and the Cotentin. This system is tactical, not operational.

I have a rule that I have to play a game a certain number of times to be a 10.  I have a strong feeling this game will achieve the 10.

I believe this is the greatest area-impulse game ever made.  [thing=1423][/thing] was the first, but it has not aged as well and can feel too long.  This one is just right with its sunset die roll.  The scope of the games are different, but from what I have seen, this games DNA is copied a lot more in the succeeding Area-Impulse games than Arnhem.

The supply rules, D-Day, paratrooper drops...it just drips with theme on to the solid and successful operational level sunset die roll system.

Never have I played a game where there is minimal casualties and I still lose the game, due to strategic overview.

An excellent game that test the German's iron nerve to hold the line while the Allies pound you to the ground. Counter attacking only at the most oppotunistic moment!

The Allies had it easier, but every day the impulse passes, gives the allied player that much more headaches!

Good game if you want to get a stroke.

RATING: 8
The impulse system works very nicely in this game with the Allies and the Germans needing to both defend and attack. Lots of tough decisions every turn. Bit of a steep learning curve and it might take a learning game just to figure out how everything fits together and what's important.

One of my most played wargames. Easy and clean game mechanics, tensed, Interesting game for both sides. Rich in tactics. BKN is a very situational wargame. Long term strategy is of no use, simply break your way out. It is strong in the Normandy campaign too. Think of the occupation of Caen, the cut-through of the Cotentin peninsula and the connection of Omaha and Utah beaches.

On the downside is that die roll system is - although elegant - not always fair. If you are stuck with bad die rolls early in the game, this will often decide the game.

Great wargame that recreates the Normandy landings.  The rules are well written, but can take a few readings, as terminology created by the author is found throughout.  Once the rules are grasped, the game comes naturally and players can focus on the nailbiting decision making that exemplifies what makes this a great wargame.  Deserves a reprinting, as I obtained my copy from an auction site.

Very disappointed.  Even the extended game only gets you half-way to the date of the historical breakout.  Rules are simple, but the rulebook is written for lawyers rather than learners.  A few good ideas (e.g., simple mechanism for encouraging divisional integrity), just as many bad ones (e.g., supporting attack with the dregs of your army has exactly the same effect as supporting it with elite units).  Oversized counters far too big for the map.  Hard to take seriously as a wargame.

I do agree with those who say, more or less, that the rules should be better written.  One might think that after all this time, the kinks and clunks in the wording would have been sorted out.  Don Greenwood, having earned both his keep and his place in our wargaming hearts, seems to suffer from a "let them eat cake" attitude when it comes to his loyal critics.  

Seriously, short of Edleweiss and Ticonderoga, these may be the worst set of rules ever written for a wargame in the English language.  I think the only reason that gamers learned this game, and learned to love this game, is by much trial and much error, with knowledge communicated verbally.

RATING: 8.8
Great game with the "zone" system. I returned recently playing it, after I tried Turning Point Stalingrad (same zone system). Still a lot of + 1 and -1 modifications on the die roll and lots of chrome that adds to the complexity.
But after playing 5 years of Euro games it's good to be back in wargaming. So much more historical data and depth.
Upgraded the score because B:Normandy is a good game with a certain value for the serious (war)gamer.
Most eurogames give you the fun of a coke, but a good wargame has so much more to offer. Just look at the pictures.
Historical correct. Tense fighting with good balance. Makes you want to read about the campaign. Allied AND Germans can attack. No unrealistic losses (10 units for the Allied at most) and never complete Divisions. A game about strategic commitment, supply and readiness of your troops instead of exchanges and Defender eliminated results.
For beginners a little too complicated. But ANY wargamer should have this game.

After one play. A crunchy and slow-moving distillation of AH's old Normandy game (The Longest Day) using the game engine first introduced in Storm over Arnhem. High points include the fairly straightforward combat and supply system. Low points include the rule book and its tangled explainations of just about anything; the laundry list of combat and movement modifers; and the secondary game of taking, destroying, and repairing bridges. The map is colorful and constrasts well with the pieces (which are also nice), but ALL information is oriented for the convenience of the the German player. If you're a dedicated grognard, you can probably add a couple points to this rating.

15+ years old and still going strong - there are surprisingly few wargames you can say that about. The only problem is the "end of the world" effect after the first week, so the Germans can counterattack much more recklessly than seems reasonable. Still, the best game on the D-Day invasions that I've played, and a top-tier wargame of just moderate complexity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Deluxe edition? I don't know about that. But L2 has done a pretty nice job with this, with a decent card-stock map that won't require plexiglass, as well as the one key feature the AH version was missing: color coding on the battalions for parent division. This is a key piece of information that will be great to have. Other than that, L2 was wise and the look of the new version is almost identical to the original. It looks to me like the same original art, maps, etc. The only lame bit is the plastic X's for disruption - they look kinda cheesy. I'd have rather had the original's counters.

I still would like to see scenarios starting in the 2nd and 3rd week, just for variety. The 1-week scenario is great and almost certainly the best game, but once you've played it 20+ times some variety would be nice.

What can you say about a game you play for the first time in a year to find you can't tear yourself away from the table?  After the game ends you immediately want to play again...

BK:N is the definition of a 10 and the gold standard among games where you want to do more than you can, every turn.

The rulebook could have been organized better, but the rules are hole free - an achievement in-and-of itself.

Is it a good simulation ... it ain't a bad one, and for the bang it gives you ... nothing portrays Normandy better.

This game will *always* have a place in my collection.

---------

The pinnacle of the Area/Impulse system.  Once you absorb the rules employed by the family of Area/Impulse games - this is a fantastic game of resource management, tense choices, and strategy.

A certifiable classic.

I played it 5 times in a row when I first got it.

This is is my favourite of the Storm Over Arnhem system series. The Allies have overwhelming strength but have a tight schedule to achieve the necessary objectives for a victory. They have the choice of going in for a small number of very strong attacks or going for more attacks where the quantive advantage of each one will be smaller.

The Germans will be spread very thin and have to decide where and when to pull back to avoid anhilation.

The most balance in the area impulse game system with all the right chromes and historical detail to make it a worthwile game to played about the Normandy landings. Tense and engaging game that captures the problems and dilemmas of both the Germans and Allies in the campaign. New players to wargame may be turned off by the rulebook though since its written in the old AH style and is heavy read. But if you can get over that, BON is a gem of a game.

Avalon Hill.  Good game.  Fun to play.  The area movement dynamic is reasonably well designed and allows for reasonable flow as the Allies assault the beaches and move inland.  The Germans feel the full weight of Allied air and offshore naval bombardment and later the full weight of massed Allied artillery.  The Germans pray for bad weather in order to rush reinforcements into the holes or weak line.  Can the allies grab the bridges before they can be blown?  Will the Germans get enough reinforcements to stem the flow of men and material coming ashore?  Will the Allies successfully break out?  The game keeps players on edge with lots of dice rolling, heavy combat, and lots of casualties(mostly on the German side).  Different length scenarios are designed into the game.

stilted, broken game. lines of counters slugfest. not representative of WW2 at all. (see above). And looong.

Even battle-roll a 2 versus a 12 is 10 step losses. Luckfest. Historicity thrown out but playability not added. way way too long- too boring to be frustrating.

Amazing ideas couched in obscure rules writing L2 clearly didn't spend much time at all cleaning up the original rules set. Will persevere, but this will persist as an example of how not to write. To an extent, this sloppiness spills over into the design. 

Really expected more from a new edition. Get the old one if you can find it.

After a solo. Trying to get a feel for the subsystems. Rulebook written such that you must constantly do lookups. The flipside of the GoG rulebook, come to think of it--this one is bad because it is so verbose. Anyway, German victory in the one-week game. Will be able to stand it a little better after more play. 

An attempt at historicity. (US 359IR landed with 29ID, however, and not with its parent 90ID, but whatever). Seems hysterical to me that it follows the same weather script, turn by turn. Allowing it to change between impulses is neat, but not enough. Continued good weather was a huge worry to allied command and it should be for the players as well. The bridge treatment is fiddly and way, way overdone.

I've got a couple of plays in now.  Excellent system, with lots of tough decisions to be made between movement (and making your units spent), supply, the impulse system, and general combat options.

Finally after 13 years of this sitting on my shelf, I finally got to play.  I was impressed with the game.  Lots to think about.  Presents some tough choices on where to attack and how much to commit.  Really like the impulse system that keeps you guessing on when the day will end.  The downside is that the board spaces are too small to hold all the units.  Stacking gets really fiddly as some units are spent, some are disrupt 1, and some are disrupt 2.  It was looking bad for the Germans, but by Day 3 things slowly stabilized.  The length of the game is of concern.  We played 5 hours and still had 2 days left before we had to call it quits.  This game needs to be about 2 hours shorter.

A gripping simulation of the Normandy landings and immediate aftermarth.  You very quickly get to associate with the individual units and lay of the land, rapidly building a narrative across the course of the campaign with plans forming in terms of divisional assaults into such and such a town rather than moving counters.  Careful planning and and use of Divisional assets rather than individual units, is rewarded, with the initial moves being largely dictated by allied strategy with the Germans hanging on to key areas and launching limited counter attacks until the weather allows them to swing greater punches without fear of allied air cover.  Indeed, this passive stance on the German part is the one draw back in an otherwise fine game, with the German player having to bide his time in the early game and simply react - whilst historically accurate, this can be frustrating.  That aside, one of the best wargames around.

The only real negative is the rulebook, which is pretty bad, but this is compensated by the really nice map and large counters of the Deluxe edition. An additional factor in its favour is that the small scenario is playable in an evening.

This is a great wargame.  None of the "I'm going out for a food run" lag of the old IGo-Ugo hex and counter style games.  WAY ahead of its time.  I'm surprised this system is only now being revisited in other games such as Storm over Stalingrad.

An innovative "area impulse" game that's by general agreement, the best and tensest of the genre.  Among experts, various rule tweaks were needed to balance the game, but for beginners like me, you can just wade in and see how you fare.

RATING: 7
If you like area games, this is among the very best.  If you like regimental-level operational games of the Normandy campaign, this is among the very best if not THE best.  Takes a different kind of mentality to play the German; while there will usually be opportunities for serious counterattack (particularly when the weather obliges), they are few and far between until the last turn, which may put off some players.  Both players face quite a puzzle that is unique to their army and each game goes differently since players are never sure when the turn ends every turn, ensuring high replayibility.

This is an absolutely fantastic game.  I've played twice so far.  On the complicated side for me (basic mechanics are fine, details/exceptions means lots of rulebook referencing).  However, there are a wide range of possible strategies, highly variable outcomes, and lots of deep or meaningful choices whose impact aren't always readily apparent.  This means that you get a tense, very interesting, and very re-playable game.  Absolutely one of the best boardgames I have ever played.  I had to dock it half a point for two reasons.  First, it IS a bit complex, and two, the board is simply too large for me to play it often.  It's large enough that I have to use the kitchen table instead of my normal gaming table, and because the game is a bit long for single sitting, this means that it simply isn't going to get played nearly as much as I would like it to!

Fun chess-like back & forth Normandy campaign game, as I recall. The L2 edition sports nicer counters, but a flimsier map (the AH mapboard is still better, IMHO).

A recent playing revealed that Breakout Normandy hasn't aged well.  The rulebook is insanely bad, particularly when it comes to rivers/bridges.  The pace of play is too slow, and the vulnerability of expended units creates too many game-y unintuitive situations.  This impulse system works okay for tactical situations like Arnhem Bridge, but doesn't make much sense here.  Sold mine.

Two plays. In BKN there are some great mechnisms, lots of situational variability from game-to-game, occasional swings of fortune, and many different strategies available to the Allies and tactics possible for the Germans, but in terms of how satisfying it is to play I feel that rather than being a "great" game it is merely a very big "good" game, and overall it ends up only being an "okay" experience for me after factoring in the complicated rules and the long duration.

RATING: N/A
Not rated yet because I've only tested it solitaire, but this game has gotten under my skin a bit, which is a novel thing for an impulse game. Looks like just about the right level of chrome for me and the game has plenty of narrative. Both sides get to attack and every decision is important. It is unfortunate that Mr. Greenwood and I appear to be two wargamers divided by a common language -- I find his rules a slog for learning, and would accept their being twice as long if they made so many critical details that are presently implicit far more explicit and hard-to-miss.

*  I used to like this game more but feel like it's a bit dated.
*  Rules are non-intuitive, particularly in the bridges and rivers area.
*  L2 second edition is pretty much the same as the first from a rules, strategy, and tactics perspective.
*  Not a lot of 'movement' in this game but, despite that, it still can create moments of excitement.

Played a few times now, and there is very little variation from game to game.

Its plays out almost exactly every single time, and leads to the same forgone conclusion for result. 

Not overly complex, HOWEVER, the rules are laid out poorly and leave the player to assume or read into to many of the rules. Perhaps they are drawing from experienced players from another game system.

Less of a game, or more of a simulation ( or re-telling ) of the events of D-Day as the allies, as in real life, have won every time.

Breakout Normandy is one of the area-impulse wargames where players activate the units in map areas rather than hexes. This game creates tension and a very strong feel of playing out the invasion of Normandy doe to the back and forth play of impulses. Assaults are a whole lot of fun and supply is handled in a way only the AH area-impulse games (and their progeny) presented. Good, good stuff. There's chrome, mostly in the artillery and landing rules but with this revised L2 version (I have played the original AH game as well) it is clearly a mid-weight wargame. I love it. I would be playing right now if I could.

UPDATE: Since my first game i have played a couple more Area Impulse games. I enjoyed those much more for their easier accessability. I feel area impulse games should be rather small in scope.

______

Some games age well, BKN hasn't.. at least for me.

It's too long, too fiddly & pretty lucky for no concernable reason other than being designed in the early 90s.

The game feels outdated, counter density is way too high & could have been easily cut in half. You roll dice way too many times.. you wanna move german troops more than one step? Roll a die for each counter! You wanna land troops onto the beach? Roll once to thrice for each counter.
You wanna use an enemy bridge? Roll! You wanna bombard? Attack? Build? Roll! Oh wait, let's use "advantage" & REROLL!

Additionally the whole nature of the D-Day operation feels too scripted for me, in many wargames you vie for victory, whereas during D-Day the only question is will the Wehrmacht be overrun by the 12th or 13th.

You often have tiny spaces stacked up high with up to 10 counters that each has another disrupt counter on/next/between them, wich you have to flip a lotta times..

Also logistics will probably win you this game.. and i'm more of a tactical guy.. flanks get me more excited than extensive foresight-planning of where & when you can sneak in your supply points, while denying your opponent that crucial refresh.

The L2 Version has great components. The rule book is old-school bullet points with almost no examples & no pictures whatsoever, but they've included pretty good examples in the appendix.
Still took me about 10h of rule studying with the usual bgg search from time to time.

Deep and with near-infinite replayability. The system seems historically suspect - only the loser takes casualties in combats, for example, but everything works together very elegantly and it yields reasonable results.  Playing time is about 4 hours.

After hearing all the fuss from grognards (and many casual gamers) we gave this a try.  And a try, and another try.  The game could be easily explained by a pro in thirty minutes, but reading the "brief" rules is a chore -- note that neither I nor my opponent had previous area-movement game experience.  The third try was the charm, and I can now see why BK:N is such a highly-respected game (not so sure about the simulation part).  Minimal down-time for the players, nailbiting throughout, highly replayable and quick to play once learned (the June 6 to June 12 scenario can be completed in a long evening).  Rating docked a bit because, unless played frequently,  the poorly-written rules make getting into the game unnecessarily difficult.

My instinct told me that area-impulse movement system does not suit this D-Day campaign, where paddy fields and bocage are the dominant type of terrain for German long-drive counterattack strategy.  The area movement limits the possible thursting push that can be encountered in other D-Day game, e.g. the classical "Fortress Europa".  Better try the hex games "Against the Reich", or the more latest "Killing Ground" or "Ardenness '44" first.

I would probably play this again, whereas I would never play most of the AH war-games.

This is my favourite of the area movement impulse system games.

I think it is well balanced, but asymmetrical - so your experience of the game is vastly different depending on the side you play, but you have an equal chance of winning.

It is tight, tense and highly interactive.  It is also a wargame that is heavy enough (lots of historical flavour and direct conflict) without being so detailed as to turn away people from a gaming (rather than strictly wargaming) background.

It has been way too long since I played.

Highly replayable.  A little tricky at first.  After a couple games, you are fine.  This is an impulse game which means that the order of activations cannot be predicted - definitely a left-handed monkey-wrench in the perfect plans we all have.  Best Normandy campaign game I've ever played.

By BGG criteria an "8":  "Very good game. I like to play it.  Probably I'll suggest it and will never turn down a game."  That remains as true today as when the game was released back in 1991.  Rating based on over 300 playings of the Avalon Hill original.  Not the most accurate simulation of the Normandy landings, which has not hindered its popularity.  It's just a fun game.

The rules are hard to get into, but this is a very rewarding wargame: there are lots of things each players wants to do, but so little time. And it's very tense indeed.

I bought this when MMP sold off their inherited AH stock, and that was a good move! Great fun to play - it really needs a reprint now that MGMG has proved so successful.

I recently got this one out again and remarked, "they just don't make games like this anymore".  Big, heavy, MOUNTED mapboards, lots of counters, a dense rulebook but illustrated and layed out well...this is a great game.  Dense and meaty, the play time is a bit long for me these days and the counter art doesn't compare to modern games, but still...a classic.

One of the best *playable* wargames. Storm Over Arnhem was a great step forward for the hobby -- it was one of the earliest games that had a really exciting, interactive play mechanic, with a perfect level of complexity/abstraction. This game is probably the pinnacle of that system. More gamey in some respects than others in this system, but a great practical game.

The best of the area-movement wargames.  A time-tested classic.  The impulse system and variable turn lengths make it a real nail biter in FTF play and makes it work well as a solitaire game.

Very solidly-constructed game, great fun to play, slight bias towards the Germans, but then the Allies are more fun to play, almost endless re-play value and it plays out in 3 hours.  The game is simple but the rules are written in impenetrable Greenwoodese so best to get someone to talk you through it, which will take 10 minutes.  Easily the best in the SOA type area game series, including the feeble MGMG follow-up published by MMP.

Love this game system.  One of the few WWII games that emphasizes the need for keeping reserves for a counterattack.  Great logistics, air/sea/artillery bombardment, and air interdiction systems. Variable length turns and the impulse system lead to a great deal of tension and agonizing decisions.

Overall, one of the best war-games games I've ever played.

That being said, the rules (though not complicated) are not laid out particularly well.  It took me about four games to realize all the rules blunders I was making.  A great system poorly taught in the rulebook.  This game would be a 10 otherwise.

Upping the rating from 9 to 9.5 after repeated plays.  Damn entertaining game that has a great 'feel' for the campaign.

I don't think the house-to-house  "spent when moving"mechanic, that works well in the first 2 games, less so in TPS, can be applied to such a large scale conflict. A squad might become vulnerable crossing a street, but a battalion moving just doesn't.

Don't like the river/ bridge capture rules either, which are as clear as mud.

I've never found this game particularly exciting or entertaining. I feel the the game overreaches the limitations of the area-impulse system in terms of scope, and the front certainly wasn't static on one flank at any singular time. To me, the praise for this game seems to be coming from the perfect plan type tournament gamers, who have analysed it to a degree that beggars belief. I do know that my regular opponents found it scripted and stilted as a game once one became familiar with it, and like me would rather play the earlier games using the system. Certainly the initial landings are so abstracted that one loses much of the initial flavour. A game that attempts to cover too much at too high a level for too little reward. The Rulebook is atrociously written for what should be a simple system to get to grips with. Other than that the physical quality of it is very good, the mounted mapboard making for a long lasting lifespan if one is prepared to go to all that effort deciphering the turgid drafting of the rules.

An area movement game ala SOA. The the subject matter of Normandy 44 is great and the theme comes through well in the game. The rules are okay, with some questions around how bridges are handled and some flipping back and forth. The Player Aid Card is missing the 7>= statement for bridge construction/destruction. Using a depot to repair a bridge rules indicate that one can do it, but only the example below defines this as 1 SP. Little stuff like that.

Excellent tactical game that can easily be played in an evening. Play is not as constrained as in Storm Over Arnhem & it's a smoother game than Thunder at Cassino and Turning Point: Stalingrad. Play appears to be balanced. Rules shouldn't bog you down.

The game plays very differently for the two sides. Germans are struggling to get reserves into position, dealing with aerial interdiction and timing - you don't want to get those flipped units next to Allied tanks and artillery too early in the turn. The Allies are absorbed with getting their forces ashore and then punching holes in the defences to reach the VP areas and cut of Cherbourg. Both sides have to deal with the turn length uncertainty - there's much to do and only so many hours in the day.

It's a great package, but alas it takes a little too long to regularly get to the table.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is my favorite wargame of all time.  The Normandy campaign is my favorite aspect of WWII and this game does a fabulous job of recreating the initial landings and airborne phases without getting bogged down in the beach fighting.  It then does a perfect job in creating the back and forth tension where both sides must choose where to attack and how to reinforce the troops.  It is a great test of history to see if you can do better or as well as the historical counterparts.

I really love the area/ impulse system because of the back and forth nature of the mechanics.  This game has great decision making because you always have more to do then the time to do it.  The variable end of turn creates high tension as you progress through each turn.  Its is still the best area/ impulse game out there and an outstanding tournament game.

The only knock for me is it takes a while to play, but its a great PBEM game to play.

A great game that is always a lot of fun.  The game often comes down to the last turn and even the last die roll.  Because this is an area movement game, it has a chess-like feel about it with each side trading off moves.  The conventional wisdom within tournaments is that the Germans have an advantage and players will bid supply points to the allies to play them.  Generally between 5-30.  This game offers a high level of replayability as the Allies often find themselves stopped in one location and have to hunt for their VP somewhere else.  The allies have been compared to a tube of toothpaste in that regard...basically you squeeze them in one spot and they squirt out somewhere else.

Uses a variant of the [b]Storm Over Arnhem[/b] system, except only point units contribute their full combat power and spent units usually contribute nothing. Allied interdiction severely limits Axis movement, which is historical. Combat is extremely 'dicey', with wild swings in both directions, but the worst result an attacker can suffer is Disrupt 1. This is a fantasy scenario where artillery are the most powerful units in the game, allowing a devestating attacks at no risk. Supply is critically important for refitting your units, but the front lines are usually so tightly held tracing supply is not an issue; remember that the Axis can use Cherbourg as a limited supply source.

Flooded borders are a significant obstacle, barring all movement across except by bridges. Rivers aren't that major an obstacle, since the attacker can make a river assault with minor disadvantages. Bridge demolition plays a major part in this game, which is strange because it's so out of touch with the strategic–operational scale, as is the nomination of a point unit for combat.

The Germans are mostly a punching bag for the Allies, with few interesting decisions, but the Allies have to achieve a lot in a very short amount of time, making it very hard for them to win the standard game; I suspect the extended game is far more favourable to the Allies. The fight for Caen will be crucial to victory, being worth 4 VP and in range of the Royal Navy for naval bombardment. If the Axis hold out long enough for the SS divisions and Panzer Lehr Division to reach the front lines, they could end up establishing a static defensive line.

Oddly, this is the only game I know of where the victory condition is set to a fraction of VP, where you need 9.6 VP to win. The rule book is atrocious, written in a dated style and poorly organised. Moreover the rules are quite fiddly. I suspect there's a good game in there somewhere, and I'm sure this was a good game in its time, but it has not aged well. As of this review, the game is already 25 years old.

There are some stupid people in this database - One person rates it as "Overly complex and unplayable". Unplayable... what do they think the other people who have rated it are doing with their game? BKN is neither over complex or unplayable, unless you are a six year old. It creates a very tense, quick playing game on a complex subject and is solitaire friendly. It is the only game a have played four times in a row solitaire.

Extensive play does appear to favour a German Victory as the Allies need a touch of fortune with weather roles.

Not played in a while but it is the only wargame I've got that I've played (solo) four or five times on the run. Plays very quickly with little down time. My only critisism is that below average luck can really screw it for allies. The Germans, I feel can survive a few bad rolls but for the Allies....a day ending very early is bad news. However a gaming friend has played it at least 20 times and only record one loss, which indicates that good play is usually rewarded

This is a very good game... so why don't I play it more often?  I guess it's too long/complex for comfortable play. (I usually pull out SOA instead.)  However, what saves BK:N  IMO is the "Capture of Cherbourg" scenario you can find in the Boardgamer #5-3.  Try this! It uses only the west map and focuses on the Utah beach breakout, an interesting situation.  The historic goal is to sever the pennisula and capture Cherbourg within three weeks- no counting of VPs! [The typical BK:N game only covers the first week.] So, you can play the advanced concepts of the game within a tolerable time period; easily in an evening.  Enjoy!

The Area-Impulse games are really top of my gaming interests at the moment, fuelled by my recent CyberBoard playing of the founding game - Storm over Arnhem. From what I can gather, Breakout is THE game of this genre to play so it will be next on my playlist.

My first copy was unusable and trashed after water/mold damage while boxed and in storage in the garage.  Bought another one on ebay and hope to find the time to dive back in some day.  Normandy is my favorite military historical period, so how could I not have this one?

Too long to get it out very often, but what a great game.  Remarkably elegant design makes it feel much less complex than it appears.

I played a bit of the 2011 reprint. It certainly plays like an antique. The system tends to rely much more on die rolling than strategy. Given the time suck, it's far less satisfying than a game that offers more agency to players. This game could certainly be played in about 4 hours once both players have a grasp of it which is right on the edge of reasonable play time for a game of this nature. The game balance wasn't particularly rewarding. The allies are competing against the map or more than the other player. I found playing the Axis a miserable experience regardless of the outcome. Interdiction being rolled for each individual unit meant planning was basically impossible unless it was overcast. The supply discrepancy was wide and didn't make any thematic sense, but I'm not a WW2 buff by any means. The game should probably be rated a 6 and the rulebook a 2, so I'm splitting the difference here.

Terrible, unintelligible rules, but a reasonably nice ebb and flow to the game once it is up and running. I find the area impulse system tough to solo because play switches back and forth between the two sides so frequently (meaning you have to change your whole mindset and the side you are identifying with every minute or two).

Only played it once but I enjoyed it. The dice favored my opponent big time and I made some definite beginner mistakes. Looking forward to p,aging it again.

Impulse system taken to Normandy. Great simulation of strategical decision-making. A bit too long to play to get on the table often.

Rules are not complex but are quite numerous. Need more plays to put your fingers on each and every one. And heck it ain't no 'simulation' but so what? It's good.

One of the worst rule books I've ever struggled with, but the impulse system is a revelation! Interconnecting the supply and impulse track creates a terrific gaming environment. Dice fortunes have a huge impact, but that just makes it fun.

Prefer this to TP:S because:
- it's faster paced
- the default defender set up doesn't suck
- it's got Canucks ;-)

Rules are just too difficult.  Not because the game is complex, but because they are presented and organized poorly.  I think the game might be OK, but the rules prevent you from getting to the game.

With this game I feel the same  as with Republic of Rome, it could be a 10 to me, I love the theme, the components, it's very deep...BUT (it's a big but) I think you need 2 degrees, 5 MBA and work in the NASA to know how to play it, its rules are so hard that you need hours and hours and hours to master the game. If I would have these hours maybe I put it a 10.

Una caja imponente - de grande - que esconde en su interior un clásico de los wargames con un tema poderoso: El día D. Oleadas de aliados embistiendo con furia Normandía y los alemanes siempre insuficientes que tratarán de frenarlos como sea.

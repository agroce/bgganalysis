This is a decent, quick playing WW2 hex game. It's progenitor was the old Avalon Hill's War at Sea. So if your looking for a land version of that system this is sort of it.

Simple, playable combat system, but does the job in conveying the difficulties of the Ardennes. I just broke it our again after having it sit on my shelf for a couple years--it really is a gem to play. If I could only find a way to pick up the Command Magazine Japan's (Kokusai-TsushinCo Ltd) version they released in 2005--easier map to look at and counters updated--that would top off the package.

Simplest of the three Bulge games I own (Bitter Woods and Ardennes '44 being the others).  I like the simple system.  Map areas are tiny so I had the map enlarged 157%, which gave me a 3x3 foot map (with the original map tucked underneath to keep the charts visible) and that is a very nice size for playing on 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3.5
Congested map, another "Let the Germans Have All the Fun" truncated  framing of the battle in the "Kraut wet dream" tradition, even more one-sided than Attack In the Ardennes, from which it seems to draw a lot of elements.  The only redeeming comparison is that the congested map looks okay (even if it doesn't play okay),  vs AITA's point to point bland and ugly map treatment.  Played this 3 times, all easy landslide Ger victories.  I am just tired of Bulge Ger wet dreams  (and dice fest combat systems).

RATING: 6
Not bad, but there are serious graphical issues, and the game definitely lacks somthing - it's not tense, exciting, or all that compelling. It's also not a very balanced situation, as the game ends before the Allied counterattack. Far from bad, but not great either, and for me, not a lot to recommend it.

I had "long" hours of eniojment with this game. Really it's a game not a simultion. We could play only with a blow up (4 times) map. I don't know how it could play without it.
The game is slow paced and chess like. It becomes tense with 2 experienced opponents, otherwise it's a waste of time.

RATING: N/A
I should like this game. It is at the complexity level I prefer, it covers an historical battle of interest to any red-blooded American, and one can never have too many Bulge games. Right? But awash in a sea of green, it is very difficult to find the area boundaries on the map. Defenders indicate the game is point-to-point movement (disguised as area movement), so area boundaries don't matter. And the map is aesthetically nice enough to frame and hang on the wall. So if I can get over these barriers to play, someday I will figure out if this is a keeper in the Bulge collection. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The mechanics are surprisingly simple. The map appears complex due to lots of small areas and a non-intuitive numbering system. The game feels a little fiddly due to having to remove counters from the map for the combat resolution.

Ray Freeman&#039;s DTP game republished by GMT.  It&#039;s an area movement Battle of the Bulge game, however it&#039;s nearly impossible to see the areas!  The game play is quite simple and boils down to solving the puzzle of the road network.  Okay game.

I have just started playing this game again, and I have changed my rating to a 9. This game is a labor of love that is a blast to play, and has very clear rules-nothing is left to the player's interpretation. I really like the simple clarity of the system, and the artillery calls are cool. One tweak needed imho is to eliminate the combined arms penalty in the introductory scenario-otherwise, I don't see how the germans can ever win.

previous comment:
I really want to love this game.
I own all of the area movement games from AH, and love the system. Hexes, and stacks of units in hexes annoyes me. Anyway, I agree that the Map is very hard to use, because it is too tight and hard to see.
Zooming in by 4x would be a great help.
Also,I think artillery gets too much play as w/out it you lose some key DRMs.
This close to a great game....

Tigers in the Mist puts the Germans on steroids and then demands they go big or go home.  This isn't a game won by taking Bastogne or getting halfway across the map - if the Germans win, they do it by punching large forces through the American lines.  The impulse system is interesting at first look (there are three impulses per day, but units may only activate once), but sometimes seems to result in an ahistorically low level of activity.  Combat is extremely dicey and the game can end very quickly if the German dice are abnormally hot or cold.  What it offers over other Bulge games is a sense of mutual desperation, with both players feeling like the game is slipping through their fingers.

Ends before the allies get to counter-attack.  Other than that, a nice playable Bulge game.  However, it the allies are almost never going to attack because they need all of their units to plug the gaps in the line, they can't risk them on combat. It's a point-to-point map neatly disguised as an area game (you can only move along the roads).

This is an excellent game. While being a very tense, chess-like game of the Ardennes offensive, it's also the key objectives and problems of the whole campaign boiled down to its core. Master this game and I think you'll excel in any of the more complex and detailed tactical games about the offensive. 

I have played many small ASL scenarios from this campaign for great fun.

RATING: 7
Nice use of a relatively simple movement and combat system to give a very abstracted light simulation the Battle of the Bulge.  The map is very difficult for me to read and I found the small size of the area numbers made set up difficult and the difficultly in visualizing the web of roads on the small map added greatly to the play time as both players had to double and triple check to see if their perceived chokepoints were actually cutting off the intended route.  I enjoy the impulse system.  So far my two plays of the second scenario give the Germans a huge edge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The highest rated game on the battle of the Bulge by the serious gamers. Copies are few and were sold out quicky.  The use of area movement rather than hexes is an outstanding innovation in that the Germans usually push for advances for hexes unsatisfactorily.  From a game angle, this is definite a right decision for the battle.

This was my first real war game. I played the U.S. Game favors the Germans. In my opinion it comes down to dice rolls. If playing the US you better hope to get good dice rolls and hope your opponent gets bad rolls, otherwise there seems to be no way to stop the Germans. I would like to play again to see if using a different strategy can change the outcome of the game.

Dice are the king in this area movement version of the Bulge. Unit strengths are boiled down to a number rating that can have some interesting effects and will gain and keep control of adjacent areas if they are garrisoned. Not my favorite due to the need for many dice rolls and area movement. Still, it works well, teaches the history and is fun. Good points in my book.

Of all the games out there on the Battle of the Bulge (which offers an irresistible game situation of one sighty trying to plug gaps to prevents the stronger side from breaking through), this design chooses to depict the first week of the battle, with the Germans using the elements of surprise and advanced planning to maximum effect, while the American defenders scramble to prevent breakthroughs. Both sides have a lot to think about along the way. My rating of "7" is my initial one, based on the playing the introductory scenarios, which is well designed to introduce most of the rules by way of a game that takes an hour-plus to play. Then one can move on to a longer scenario or the campaign game. 

For a game that many experienced war gamers might rate low-medium complexity, this game is a bit on the fiddly side, plus there is a fair amount of errata, but errata that has been well addressed by either the designer or gamers. With this game in particular I found it easiest to learn by reading through the rules and errata but then just sinking into playing the introductory scenario, as the rules flow soon becomes apparent. 

GMT production that has some errata and rules clarifications to consult, but on the whole is toward medium complexity, with a rulebook that is written in a straightforward manner, and features useful notes from the designer about how both sides may approach strategy and tactics. Also, the chits are good and thick.

Nice game, and a nice change of pace from other Bulge games.  The map is a bit difficult to read and despite some comments to the contrary when the game first game out, I think the game is actually pro-US, which in the end harms play...it is too easy perhaps in this system to bog down movement with a single weak unit.  Still, a fun and well thought out game.

Here's some responses to comments made by others:  UPDATED 18 AUG 2016
Yep. The map areas in the original front line areas are too small to fit the counters in comfortably. It works, but it does look/feel cluttered. I've done some experimenting and blowing the map up 137% makes the smallest area big enough for two stacks and makes the map fit on a 30 inch wide table.

Reading the map boundaries. Yes, they are a little light. This was a conscious decision which, in retrospect, was ill-advised. Making the borders a little thicker/darker would help. OTOH, you can get used to them as they are.

There are lots of dice...the advantage is you don't get screwed by one bad roll. 1:1 on Tobruk in Afrika Korps anyone? We roll lots of die at a time, so the die rolling goes pretty quick.  OTOH, you CAN still get screwed by the dice. At the WBC this year, I whiffed with 13 shots on one attack. That's about 1/1000 probability. It messed up my offensive really badly.

Several folks complained that the game is lop-sided in favor of the Germans. Sorry, it is not. Most people bid to play the US in both the 5th Panzer and Campaign Scenarios. IMO, the Campaign is more pro-US than the 5th Pz Scenario. This year I went 1-2 as the Germans at the WBC. (Usually I do a bit better). While it may seem like a German cakewalk at first, if played with reasonable restraint, the US has formidable defensive resources.

US doesn't get to counterattack you say? In virtually every game I have played over the years, there is always at least one, perhaps more opportunities for US counterblows. These are usually spoiling attacks designed to recover a key position or perhaps isolate an overextended German spearhead. I'm making one right now in my current game of the Campaign, mostly to throw the Germans into a quandary. I don't NEED to counterattack, but assuming it works, the German player will have to divert resources away from more sensitive areas to keep me from fortifying Marche...a key VP area.

At the WBC this year, I had one 5th Panzer game where there were SIX battles in Bastogne. Half of those were attacks by the US. Never seen that before in 20 years.

I realize that this system is not to every players taste. If you prefer hexes, a standard CRT, and lots of chrome, Bitter Woods or Ardennes 44 are going to float your boat better. If you want some fun without a lot of learning curve, but also want a game that can require some serious effort to play well, Tigers might work for you.



These are comments by the Designer, so take with the appropriate grain of salt:

The game is not meant to be a hard core simulation.  It is first and foremost intended to be a fun game which conveys the flavor of the Battle of the Bulge.

The game system is like a wedding of a Columbia block game and the A House Divided system.

It does not take but a few playing to get used to the map boundaries...for better or for worse, the graphics were intended to make the best routes not so obvious.  Some think that is OK, others do not.

Play balance actually favors the Americans...at least that is the current view of experienced players, four years after publication.

One of my favorite wargames is War at Sea, if that gives you a clue as to what the Tigers system may be like. ASL or Barbarossa: AGC-AGN-AGS it is not!

Played this twice now - first time, the campaign scenario that we didn't get through. The second game was the learning scenario and was definitely a good way to learn the system (it does lack the combined arms though).

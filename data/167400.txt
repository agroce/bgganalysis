GAME: Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn
RANK: 373

RATING: 3
Beautiful cards, the lack of the CCG component, lots of things that offered a better MtG experience. Sadly, this didn't do it for me; the pre-constructed decks hobble you with card draws, and I found the game is much more gasoline ignition than wood burning fire. This last piece is really the crux of why I'm not fond of Ashes; I'm more interested in a game which has a much more clearly defined start/buildup/crux arcs than cool down/exhaustion style arcs to carry the game. 

One of the few games where I could see the writing on the wall 2/3rds of the game (which barely lasts 5 turns in many cases) and we would concede to reset and setup again. I'd play it over some other things, maybe more cards to work on specialty decks would help in terms of trash in your hand, but I can't see a time when I'd ask for it since, in our experience, it had a fundamental game pace that we weren't interested in.

[I]tl;dr - Ashes has the unfortunate distinction of being a good game that's exactly the opposite of what I tend to seek out: two-player-best wizard duel with a large metagame and steep learning curve.[/I]

Nothing against Ashes, but two-player games like this are not for me. I'm not sure what to call them (the actual genre spans everything from deck-builders, to dudes on a map, to miniature games), but the general concept is a two-player duel game, usually with a lot of custom cards or fine-tuning that needs to be done to the deck/faction to make it playable. Other games in this vein would be Arena of the Planeswalkers or Codex.

They may be fine games, but just aren't for me. For one, I value the accessibility of a game that doesn't make you build your own faction (though I recognize the richness of a game allowing you to do so). And for two, I just don't have a regular opponent for these types of games. 

Ashes may be a great game, but it wasn't for me.

Has a very interesting flow. Dice as mana is a cool idea, but sides being strictly superior/inferior is a let-down, would have preferred dice that could roll one of two colors or something like that.

There is almost no interaction while your opponent takes their turn, but each turn goes so quickly and smoothly that you still feel like you are making tactical decisions based on your opponents actions.

Yes, there is dice rolling, but some faces have multiple uses (so they can be used as if you rolled a different face), and you can either discard or mill a card to change the face of a die. The dice rolling seems to insure that each turn is its own puzzle, rather than being a dichotomy between having resources or not.

Your hand is refilled and your dice are refreshed frequently, which I think is a huge boon, but that also means that you can't really play a typical "control" deck, where you are trying to run your opponent out of resources.
The majority of the time both players have options, and you typically only have 1 turn where you just can't do anything before you draw a new hand and get your dice back.

This is based solely on playing the 2 of the preconstruted decks. If there is interesting deckbuilding, I will raise the rating.

Although I have only played 2 of the Phoenixborns, I don't really get where the hype for this game comes from. Choices are limited, and not much is going on. But, the artwork is good, and the mechanics are tied to the theme. So it's kind of an empty shell for me...

RATING: 3
Starting with the good about the game: The inclusion of many women Phoenixborn is a great move for women gamers like myself. The art itself is well-done. This is about where I stop. The art is good but mauled to hell by the plain-Jane white card design which muddles it up. The Attack/Life being split so far apart causes problems with memory of the cards. The lack of proper or memorable terms for each symbol in the game (there are 11 symbols with only vague descriptions!) makes it a chore to call out actions. The game lacks any flow and feels rote "do this: thing happens" and lacks very much fun player interaction. 

The player interaction in the game is generic or griefy. In fact, several decks appear to be built to "grief" opponents as their win condition instead of just playing, namely discarding or clogging player fields. Each element in this game has been seen before in another game that did it better: Conjurations are better as ARTS in WIXOSS and Conjurations in Summoner Wars. 

The dice-based supply pool was better as fixed ramp in Magic the Gathering, which is already not so great; Dice Masters did dice based supply better. The "vanguard" style Phoenixborn don't feel like anything I'd associate with a phoenix, moreso some generic Decipher Inc "main personality", which Cardfight Vanguard and WIXOSS (LRIG) also do better, with Panini's Dragonball Z perfecting it. The battle system is generic and yet another Magic ripoff with a few changes done (everything has Trample for example, but only one blocker per attacker can be declared. Counter damage is optional etc). 

Ultimately I believe the designers felt those small changes added more strategy than they do. Overall, it just feels like it wasn't play tested by anyone who's ever played a card game before.

This opinion is currently being revisited. I still believe this game to be somewhat of an LCG lite; however, that does not mean it cannot have a place as such a game (possibly precon and draft only to make it accessable to more players)

A "competitive" card game that introduces further variance and luck through dice..... I could say more, but I need not. This without a doubt is one of my largest disappointments.

RATING: 8
Magic the Gathering remixed into a different artistic aesthetic and story. You play powerful magic users who are vying for control of their world, Highlander-like, i.e. 'there can be only one'. Mechanically it uses a pool of dice rather than lands or other mana options, so there will be that constant chance guiding your hands, but the fact you can discard to change faces and mitigate that is refreshing. Attacking and defending are fairly simple if you've played MtG, but the Actions system and costs are a bit different. Cool game, Isaac is a good designer, but I think this will require some expansions before it really heats up.

Love this game and is a great substitute for Magic the Gathering. Games have been running a touch long for my tastes but offers such an interesting dynamic on creature combat by creatures remaining "tapped" for several turns until round end. Really cool game.

Another thing to note here is that the value of a card is very different from Magic. Card Advantage is measured on the board way more than what is in hand because of summons.

Once again, game is awesome and beautiful.

Well, the theme is not the most original for a card game, I guess... but Ashes is a game with a lot of great stuff in it!

The first thing you can't help but notice is the astounding quality of the production: thick and durable cards, heavy and hard-plastic dice, sturdy box. And then, of course, there is the artwork. One of the most beautiful, stunning examples of art in gaming.

Beyond that there is a simple but deep, solid game: combining cards and dice, players battle in simultaneous turns. Every deck is different and engaging, and beyond that there are constructed and drafting!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I haven't tried deck construction at this point and have only played with the pre-constructed decks but, feel that I have a good feeling for the game nonetheless.

The game feels more like Yu-Gi-Oh rather than MtG.  The game definitely has combos, but none of the combos feel over-powered.

I'm not a huge fan of the dice resources, but believe it works well enough.  The game is fun buck lacks over powered combos, but I believe this can be viewed as a positive rather than a negative.

Interesting game. It's very tempting to call it a Magic impersonator, but this seems to rob the game of it's ingenuity and uniqueness. The pacing is very different, and there are cool mechanical twists to be found in focusing spells, meditation, exhaustion and status tokens, and the emphasis on not burning through your deck TOO fast. Really fun head-to-head tactics game that is more than just a Magic wanna be.

What a wonderful experience! Fixes two of MtG's biggest issues; you are never mana-screwed (you CAN be mana unbalanced however) and you pick the five cards in your opening hand so unless you're an idiot you'll have a good opening hand.

RATING: 8
~16 hours of play.

The back-and-forth is very interesting and different from most CCG/LCG-style card games... tempo is clearly important, as suggested by the Masked Wolves side action "casting cost" versus the more standard main action cost. The inherent abilities of the dice are also interesting, as is all the ways to use your dice each turn. I'm also slightly amused by the natural terminology that develops - I "Wolf" (or Fox?) your "Frog" or "Snake" or "Bull." The rules are also very brief and readily explained as well.

Picking your starting hand is novel as well... Ashes does a lot of interesting things for the CCG/LCG genre.

Oh, and as everyone notices, the art is excellent, and more so the graphic design is aesthetically pleasing. Netrunner, and many other LCGs/CCGs, suffer from terrible clunky graphic design. I cursed that they didn't adopt something closer to a full-art card design when I saw Netrunner (and this is further reinforced when you see the gorgeous full art cards they produce as promos.) Ashes' graphic design is clean and straight forward.

---------------------
Interesting "LCG" type game that fixes the issue with most CCG's in which you draw horrible initial hands.  Uses a similar exhaustion mechanism as Star Wars: The Card game, which I really like.  I also found the dice mechanism for the resources to be new and interesting, however, as with all of these types of games, we won't know really how good it is until their are more cards in the card pool.  The art is gorgeous, and this is one I do plan on playing much more.

The boxed competitive card game is appealing, removing the chase of CCGs and the cash dump of LCGs. The actual gameplay is tactically satisfying even if a lot of the actual competition comes from deck construction. The overall presentation is strong but the rules are somewhat lacking which can lead to a confusing experience for new players. The delay between content releases is understandable but straining and the need to buy extra dice to integrate any expansion decks simultaneously isn't very consumer conscious. Overall it's a a good alternative for people tired of MTG or Netrunner.

RIN BUILD
Rin - personally, I find Rin's pre-constructed deck is boring to play.  I think some other players share my sentiments.  However, this is a very useful deck to be given to beginners as it has very straightforward strategy and style with little concerns over subtlety of tactics or dice/cards manipulation.

Coal Pre-Con Deck (when playing against new players)
Strategy: Have Summon Iron Rhino, Hammer Knight, Iron Worker, Anchornaut, Protect
Strategic and Tactical Tips
Don't mind discarding Spiked Armor, Expand Energy and Strengthen from hands to Slash enemy Units and opposing Phoenixborn.  When wanting to Slash, leverage on the Iron Worker ability to provide additional side action and also Anchornaut if it is still on the board to do away with enemy units so you can have a clear path to attack.
Against Aradel, Coal needs to sustain himself and his unit until he can get One Hundred Blades.  Always watch the board with regards the number of Units that Aradel has as she may play Out of the Mist especially when you see that she has a Power Illusion and Natural dice. 
Don't  activate Summon Iron Rhino to bring out the its Iron Rhino conjuration the first time you play the spell card.  Summon Iron Rhino is like a plan B or insurance in case Coal could not draw and/or play his Allies.
Aradel playing against Coal must always have Steady Gaze in her starting hand.
Saria should not Summon Seaside Raven early until she sees that Coal does not have any card left in his hand and/or the Frog dice and/or Anchornaut in play.  Seaside Raven is often good to target at Hammerknight.  As such Coal has to be careful as not to summon Hammer Knight out early unless he is confident that he can immediately a Seaside Raven when it is summoned by Saria.

Note to Self:
(1) Enchanted Violinist it is errata'd form is not a 'must' include right.  Previously, EV was useful to deal with first turn Hammer Knight drop.  Currently, there is Regress that can help address the threat of this Iron Mercenaries.

Two games in, but I don't want to judge it too harshly. 

In the first game (Coal Roarkwin (me) vs Aradel Summergaard) I got shredded. Constantly short of mana and couldn't keep more than one creature in my battlefield. I got trampled rather quickly. 

In the second game (Noah Redmoon (me) vs. Maeoni Viper), I came out swinging, but my deck stalled so I had nothing worth affording for several rounds. I also wound up short of mana fairly quickly. I got destroyed shortly afterwards.

I think the mechanics are decent, but I was getting frustrated at how well the decks I was playing didn't work. 

This game deserves another chance.

I really wanted to like this, but after five plays now, I  just don't get the appeal. The decisions are interesting... at first. I like trying to max out how you use your dice, what cards you can play, when to attack, etc. But ultimately the game suffers by being 1) WAAAY too long, and 2) really, really repetitive. You just do the same thing over and over again. As units die, you just conjure them again. The same spells get cast over and over, turn after turn.  And with blocking units, games can last over two hours! It's just not worth the time. Too bad, because I love the art and the theme.

This is a good game.   It also has fantastic art.  I need to say that up front because I'm not actually going to keep this one in my collection.  I'm letting it go simply because its a pain to teach and I have other two player games that are neither better nor worse than this game that that already fill the nitch that this game fills.  My collection of games is already larger than I would like and though I considered keeping this one I am taking the route that will cost me less in the long run.

Dueling card game. (can be played up to 4 but 2 is optimal)
Spellbook + arena : get ready to fight!


Pros: 
Stunning artwork, Fernanda Suárez is aaammaaazingg.
4 out 6 of base game characters are woman.
Dice are beautiful and great quality (at least for my edition)
Love it.


Cons: 
Lots of game of the same type so it has difficulty raising as much as it could have. (Not very popular around here)
I'm not sure about that whole voodoo-doll-ish white woman (or at least *very* light skin) 
I would have loved if the egyptian woman would actually look egyptian and not like some white hispter disguised as Cleopatra.


Note on diversity: 
With the expansions, especially the newest ones (2017) we can see much more racial diversity and it's really one of the rare games where we can see powerful and diversed people.
One male character is bi. 
There is also a trans character (we could argue tho, 'cause they were raised as a gender they weren't assigned at birth, but does the story talk about how that person actually identitify?) 

Anyhow great looking and fun game. Really love it.
Not sure is I'll buy the future expansions though, since they won't be illustrated by Suárez...  I already have more than enough cards anyways.

Deck building card game in the vein of M:TG. The artwork is beautiful and I love the variety you get from mixing and matching the various cards to form your deck and dice pools. For fans of CCG, this is definitely worth checking out with the many expansions available!

Very similar to Magic but with dice for Mana. The gameplay,unlike MTG, is broken down to doing just one main action a turn, whether it be plsying a card or attacking. This is interesting, it leads to some back and forth strategic play involving the card play and dice usage. After 3 plays I like it and look forward to exploring more. Not sure there's enough replay value in the base box though.

In a similar way as Netrunner, Ashes pushed me to think differently about a well-known game archetype (CCG/LCG).  Can't say how long I'll play compared to Netrunner, but Ashes is definitely a good game.  Fantastic art design, too.  Love the character art in particular.

Pros: Fantastic art and easy-to-dive into experience.

Cons: Derivative theme, lack of tactical complexity.

I think this would make either a fine starter card game for someone unfamiliar with the genre, or a good "non-card gamers card game." It was not unenjoyable, was well balanced, and fun for the first few games.

If you have some experience with other card games, the inclusion of a few dice will not revolutionize the experience.  The game is sold on the basis of the "first-five," but this double-edged sword is likely to hinder the strength or complexity of cards to formulaic simplicity.

I enjoy LCG/CCG/TCG genre pretty much and this one is among the best.
Using dice as mana is unique also surprisingly fair (even better than Magic's land) mechanic.
Stunningly beautiful arts. The only thing what I don't like it is too hard the get extra dice.

Horrifically imbalanced starter decks. Game might be good, but I have no idea because of the horrifically imbalanced starter decks. Honestly, guys, come on. Playing as the grizzled seadog, I got utterly shanked because I couldn't deal any damage to the lady with the blood puppets since she had a thing that dealt damage to me as I dealt damage to it. The iconography is BEYOND confusing as well.

I'm not sure if I just liked it cause in rekindled the magic I use to play but more fun than I expected.

Why I got rid of it - I enjoyed magic for the deck making and in this I was just using premade decks, so that was less fun.  When I played with others they did not make there deck so thay also seemed to have less fun playing.  Did not feel vested.

Demo'd once; found it kinda-fun - but I've always most enjoyed the deckbuilding (and subsequent seeing-how-it-works) portion of dueling games like this, so that I wasn't as enthused about piloting the prebuilt deck isn't really surprising.

I was expecting the dice to add more chaos than they did; they instead acted as interesting constraints, and seemed less swingy (and more *transiently* swingy) than M:tG's land draws/drops. My opponent did have to work to overcome worse die rolls, but did so semi-successfully.

I haven't gotten deep enough into other dueling CCGs/LCGs to compare/contrast to anything but Magic and Netrunner; Ashes is far more like the former than the latter, and in general, I found the many differences to be positive ones. (Start with any desired hand of 5, attacking minions directly, conjurations, battle/spell limits, exhaustion stacking, dice as resources instead of mana, semi-persistent damage, and more.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This might be the game that really 'fires' magic for me.  My biggest hurdle was accepting economy from the dice, but I find it works really well.  The active spellboard is nice to reduce swinginess overall.  Solid game.

RATING: 6
Ended up cutting only because I don't have the time to devote to it.  It definitely seems like a game that is designed for, and rewards, high-level experienced play.  Each deck needs to be aware of what the other player is doing, and how to best work around their optimal strategies.  I am sure that this gives a very satisfying experience at this level of play.

However, I will never make it to this level, the level where each tiny, individual decision (dice choice, or action selection, or adding a single card to a deck) has huge strategic ramifications.  We want something that is easier to pick up and play, with little reminder of (i) what the cards do, and (ii) how to play the decks.

The gameplay itself is interesting, and crucially relies on timing - when to activate this, when to cast that - to work around your opponents plans.

The starters also seem very linear: they all have a plan, one thing that they do, and only one thing.  This makes for some serious rock-paper-scissor action, as well as fairly repetitive play unless, as I mentioned above, you start to dive deep.

Great system, just not for us.

One of the games that I want to use as an excuse to sell my MTG collection, but sadly nobody else I know wants to buy in to Ashes yet. Because of that, I'm sticking with precon setups for now which while balanced, feel slow and a bit too grindy for my liking. I like that the decision making is more complex than Standard in MTG, and the back-and-forth turn structure is great.

Once I get off my ass and use consistent sleeves, I'll get a custom insert and keep a list of constructed decks which should make play a lot more interesting. Really keen to get into constructed and see its true potential, because I feel fairly confident that there is a much more exciting game than what the precons show, hence why my rating is more optimistic than what I've described.

FFG's Legend of the Five Rings reboot is a significantly more interesting game than this, but I still need to try making Constructed decks to see if it's worth keeping. Rating lowered.

I really want to like CTC games, but usually find the upkeep is expensive and frustrating.

What I really enjoy about Ashes is that it has that vibe of pitting deck against deck WITHOUT having to spend $100 at a time on booster packs. Additionally, the art is gorgeous and the gameplay so far is involved without being too complicated. I also really enjoy that it doesn't have to 1 vs 1, comfortably accommodating up to 4 players at a time - providing you have the dice for them!

The dice-as-resources and action management is neat to see in a two player deckbuilder. Hard to judge this fairly since there aren't a lot of deckbuilding options yet with just one core set. At least you only would need to get one core set rather than spend money on random packs or extra cards.

Initially a 7 and have to wait to see if the game design is successful.

+ The best artwork of any game
+ Excellent card quality
+ Beautiful custom dice
+ Offers a choice between building a deck or drafting one
+ The drafting mechanic makes every game unique
+ Drafting your dice pool to accompany your deck builds upon the uniqueness of each game.
+ Large number of cards available in the core box
+ >2 player games flow well and do not break the game
+ Excellent combat pacing

- The rules/how-to play are a tad vague or confusing regarding certain mechanics
- Playing with 4 players can make drafting the dice irksome, with only 10 of each variety available.
- Sorting the cards after doing a draft game can be tedious, as the only indicator for the different types of cards is in small text (could have done well to accompany the card types with unique symbols to help easily identify them)

I like the game better than MtG but the quick duel game seems overplayed. Each deck and set of cards has an ideal strategy and you just end up following that while you play. I guess the most interesting thing about this game for me would be the draft mechanism.

An interesting blend of mechanics from games like [i]Summoner Wars[/i], [i]Android: Netrunner[/i] and even [i]War of the Ring[/i] with its action dice.

This game is much more tactical than the other card games that I've played, with the focus on setting up your grimoire and managing a small number of creatures and/or allies using the resources you have available, which vary from turn to turn. For some people the flat power curve may be a turn off, however.

While the timing issues can be a little gritty at times, overall it's simpler than other card games in that reactions are very limited, so you don't end up with a long chain of stuff interacting with each other. The variable abilities and hit points of the leaders is a nice way to differentiate the players.

Anyway, thumbs up for now.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I'd strongly recommend picking this game up for anyone looking for a LCG. It has a lot of elements that have been rehashed from other series, sure, but the implementation is very well done. Using dice as currency instead of mana cards or some fixed income adds enough randomization to make the game balanced between players of a wider skill level than the traditional MTG game (but not too much randomization, as you can choose to change some dice faces at the cost of discarding cards). I would say the gameplay has less complicated mechanics than MTG, but complex enough to keep MTG fans interested.

The starter decks have great synergy and we actually haven't wanted to break them up yet, although we probably will at some point. The cards themselves have great artwork and seem to maintain a pretty consistent theme in this fantasy world.

In our playthroughs we've had a great time whenever we play with 2 players, although with 4 the turns can get a little long. To be fair, we were teaching the other 2 players how to play the game, so that definitely added to it.

I just bumped the rating up to a 9 after some more plays. Ashes is very obviously a Magic derivative, but I like how quickly your deck gets up and running thanks to the dice. There are some really cool card interactions and I don't find the idea of deck building to be completely intimidating the way I do with other games (although I haven't tried it yet). I also like the alternating action system. Combine this with first rate art design and the respect shown for gamers in the art choices and product release schedule and you have a winner. I will definitely by picking up expansions to this one.

RATING: 8
Another duelling mage game but not a bad one by any means. Nothing really new but it's solid and the artwork is well done and it's easy to play. It's not as good a game as 'Mage Wars', but it is simpler, has a much smaller footprint and is a good deal more portable.

A few more plays and the game is holding up well and have don some limited deck building, however the pre-built decks contain so many cards tuned to the individual Phoenixborn that deck-building is probably a case of tweaking a few cards from the pre-builds rather than radical from scratch affairs - I could be wrong.

One negative - the expansion decks are overpriced and over-packaged  - double shrink-wrapped and enlarged cardboard insert and outer-box that can be used for nothing once opened. No justification for this - at least make the packaging functional - make the packaging functional as a deck-box. In fairness Ashes is not the only game guilty of this.

Would like to see how the deck building works out with some more sets.

Generally not so good on heavy take that games however the added element of dice acting as mana in this game really work for me. It balances the game in that you can only use your strongest cards if you roll well but there are also cards that help you reroll if you've rolled really badly. The art is lovely and the pacing of the game is just right.

I've thought about moving this up from a 6, but don't think I'm going to.  Ashes looks wonderful.  Ashes looks exciting.  Ashes has this great idea of incorporating dice rolls to determine which spells you can cast.  The issue is that this completely dictates your actions for you.  You can take 1 main action, which probably only 1 will make any sense, then you take 1 side action which... probably only 1 will make any sense.  There just aren't very many choices to make at all.  You might just have to look through the elegance to see it.  If you want a card game, go get Android: Netrunner.  That's a game where you feel like you're always one step away from winning AND losing and you are in control.

The box cover and art (by Fernanda Suarez) are immediately striking and will create a draw, for sure.  Not since the first edition of Thunderstone has there been a card game with a signature, unified look by a singular artist.   That’s noteworthy.  The game itself has a pretty strong connection to games like Magic or Hearthstone.   It’s a dueling game in the CCG/LCG mold.    Dice are used for resources, which keeps the players at parity.   Each player also has a limit on how many abilities (Spells) and creatures they are allowed to have in play.  This ceiling is easy to hit, so it quickly becomes a tactical game as both players will be throttled.    The numerous tokens and dice are a little fiddly to deal with, which slows the game down somewhat.    As with most big-box LCG starters that include multiple decks to play, each of those decks appears to be pretty one-dimensional.   I don’t think its a game that I will invest in, but it feels pretty solid.

In my opinion, this is a far superior game to MtG. I love having the same selection of cards as my opponent and seeing the different strategies that people come up with.

Upgrade from 8 to 9 as I look forward to playing this with my son and the cards are balanced. Strategy, execution, and a bit of luck tends to decide the outcome of the conflict. This often leads to close games. Awesome artwork and a fantastic online community (Facebook, Slack, and TableTop Simulator)!

Upgrade from 9 to 10 as 6 months in, this is still awesome. The expansions add interesting variety to this game. Our gaming group now has 8 regular players. The global community for this game is also great and its members are very helpful.

Multiplayer - 2 headed giant (teams) is a fantastic format.

Coal Off - Everyone is Coal and has random decks and dice is hilarious and a lot of fun.

Ashes 500 is a great new format that lets you extend exploration of all of the cards that are available.

So far only played with premade decks.  A lot to explore and I enjoy it much more than I thought I would.  Dictating the pace of the game definitely depends on your deck and I'm enjoying the discovery process there.

The dice and dice mitigation just work.  The hand management is tricky so meditating is sometimes a painful choice.  It's over when it should be and sets up much quicker than similar games.

magic style game but exhaustion tends to cause a lot of inaction in a 3 player game due to inability to defend yourself if you use too many units to attack. 2 player game can be very unbalanced using suggested deck.

Ashes is a fantastic deckbuilder, but it's also just fun out of the box. The stock decks are thematic and engaging, and the art is just as wonderful as everyone says. The dice add welcome chance, and can be mitigated enough ways to not feel too swingy.

This game is a great card battler for when I am gaming with my non-Magic the Gathering playing friends. It has a decent amount of depth but is much simpler to teach and the randomness of the dice helps when playing with a mix of experience levels because even new players could get lucky and pull out a win. I recommend looking online for deck lists since the prebuilt decks are not great. Also: art is fantastic and card quality is high. 

Collection Notes: We also own all of the promo cards and expansions and have two full sets of the base games and expansion decks (only single sets of the promo cards)

RATING: 7
A great cast of characters set in a unique fantasy world. Extra emphasis is placed on how you order your actions, since players take turns performing one action at a time. Also, the number of creatures and persistent spells you can have in play is limited. This pushes you to try and set up a combination of cards that can be used to take advantage of your opponents weaknesses, if at all possible.

It's probably a better game than the 4 I am giving it, but that shows my desire to play again. There are a lot of great LCG's out there, I'm sure, but I can't be invested in more than a couple. It's just too taxing to take on more, and it's already hard enough to find regular opponents for Magic, Battlecon, Blue Moon, etc.

I found gameplay to be not really up my alley in any case. It felt too muddled with too much going on perhaps.

Lélegzetelállító grafika, magával ragadó alapsztori. Valahogy engem ez a játék csak ezzel kilóra megvett. 
Négyesben próbáltuk ki, és meglepően jól működött, annak ellenére, hogy voltak félelmeim, hogy ez alapjaiban egy kétszemélyes játék lesz. Persze merültek fel kisebb-nagyobb problémák a többfős játék miatt, de alapjába véve működött a dolog. Az alapdoboz tartalma impozáns az lcg-khez képest. 6 tényleg teljesen játszható pakli, mind különböző lapokkal, más játékstílussal, más kombókkal. A kiegyensúlyozottságról nehéz egy játék alapján állást foglalni, de azért volt olyan phoenixborn, akire jelenleg nem tudok ellenszert. Szerencsére 6-ból egyet akár lehet ignorálni is, ha nagyon beállna a dolog, de valszeg ennyire nem is vészes a helyzet. Jó kis játék, kéne még vele tolni a kiismeréshez.

Rather than racing for the quickest victory, Ashes has you assessing each other, constantly and looking for openings to jab in your damage.

I love LCG's and I love Plaid Hat, so I was actually a bit disappointed when I first played this game. Yes, it was fun and I thought the dice idea was great, but I just felt that there was not enough in the box to make the gameplay interesting enough. You keep drawing the same cards, deck building is not even an option with just a core set. Might get better with expansions.

RATING: 7
Ashes is a fairly interesting LCG to play.  Pretty much does the "dueling wizards" thing that Magic and Summoner Wars does, among others.  However, it nicely incorporates dice into its "mana" system and has a fairly straightforward drafting and battle system.  Nice card effects and asymmetrical decks.  Lots to consider when playing cards and executing them.  That being said, I felt after awhile that it was getting a little repetitive-feeling and there wasn't that sort of "building" feeling that I really enjoy in games like this.  Killing off units isn't too difficult, so quite a bit of the game is drafting units, battling, losing them to battles, drafting more, etc.  This isn't to speak of the spell system, which I think works well.  Overall, an interesting game to play and it felt very well play-tested (which is so important in a game like this).  Lots of stuff given right off the bat with the base set, so it's not as much as an LCG sinkhole as it could have been. Time will tell if it becomes a classic.

My first game was quite fun.  It wasn't too hard to learn after the first few minutes even though I have little to no experience with this type of card game.

Better game than magic, but like magic (as a good or bad thing) this really shines when you have a group of people willing to dig in with you. It's better than magic because it's more "tactical." Meaning in magic, your gameplay is going to be essentially dictated by the deck you built and the matchup - ie not a lot of creative decision space (the fun is figuring out the best move, but usually there is only one best move). I could see Ashes going more like this if I were to get all the expansions and get really into the tournament scene, but especially as a casual game, there were a lot of neat tactical interactions that made it feel less fiddly than magic while still having more choices.

I don't like Magic the Gathering's combat system. When one player gets ahead in board position, it feels like a hopeless situation. This leads to some very frustrating play experiences. This is what happened my first game of Ashes. It was clear who was going to win within 20 minutes. Yet the game lasted 40 more. That is not a fun way to game.

I'll stick to Summoner Wars for my 2p battle game.

Great strategy deck building game. 
Got my blood pumping, I was so mad when I thought I was winning then all my monsters were totally taken out. 
I've been reading up strategies so it wouldn't happen again. 
Really, great game, though. I love the mana dice, not taken up turns building up your mana, instead you focused on strategy and how to utilize your cards and dice without running out before your opponent. 
I've only played once and can't wait to build my strategies up with more game play. There's alot of potential in this game for strategies, but the love for this game speaks for itself.

I wanted to like this so much. I REALLY wanted to. The mechanics sound interesting, the female characters are great, I love asymmetric games. But it crawled, and the pre-packed factions don't feel deep, and I think the dice mechanics take too much luck out of the equation. I think I'll stick with Summoner Wars.

This game answers the bell when I was looking for a similar game to MTG. It shares the same feeling, with amazing artwork by the way. I like that you use dices for mana instead of lands (I just love dices) and yes, you have a lot of option to manipulate them. I LOVE the fact you get to choose your starting hand. 

The mechanic is simple and yet clever how things are distributed between main and secondary action. Lots of variety in the core box. 

This is also a wallet friendly game as like some LCG, you get access to all the cards and expansion are release at a good pace without exageration (so far, 4 new phoenixborn per year with 1 major expansion).

So if you want to play MTG, without the investment in money and time, this is your game.

Interesting changes to the Magic: The Gathering formula:
- dice = always there = you can't be waiting for terrains for a long time.
- choose your starting hand = always able to "kick start" your engine.

Not satisfied with 4-player rules (no teams? no team mate support?) and that took forever to go, so... I don't play enough 1 vs 1 games.

Solid game. I like the dice mechanism for resources -- you always have resources, but which ones you get will vary. I like the idea of the First Five, but I'm not sure how much I love the end result. Some of the fun of gaining your combo based on your deck goes away with it.

There are some combos/setups I haven't figured out how to beat yet, which is a little frustrating, but overall, solid, good game. The pre-made decks is a great way to get into the game.

I have been playing MTG since 1994, when I was in college, and ARPB has essentially replaced it for me for everyday play. It is not fair to try to compare the two games too closely because they are different. If one enjoys collecting cards, building decks, and finding the synergy in the sets, nothing scratches that itch better than MTG. However, ARPB has amazing game mechanics. It is, in my opinion, a far more strategic game then MTG and relies much less on the luck of the draw. While there is not the same diversity of cards as in MTG, the game mechanic does not rely on a multitude of cards where you need to find the synergy to the same extent as MTG. I am also anticipating new cards being released as the game continues to develop. Ultimately, while I still love and enjoy MTG, I find myself playing Ashes for more frequently and enjoying it much more.

This one doesn't really work for me, unfortunately. I'd rather play MTG cube or Epic. I've only played the starter decks but they feel extremely linear.

This is a really fun head-to-head card game (I haven't tried it with more than 2 players).  While the theme is unoriginal (dueling spellcasters... where have we seen this before...), Plaid Hat really knocked it out of the park making the game feel fresh.  The dice-as-mana mechanic is so-so, but the rapid back-and-forth play is great.  I like that you can create summons that you can use repeatedly.  Each pre-constructed deck feels very unique and play different from the others.  I look forward to the expansions.

Purchased at GenCon 2015, this game takes the hunting out of Magic, adds-in a conjuration mechanic and mana dice for reducing deck entropy, and places a focus on length of game as a weapon. Ashes shines in its simplicity of the more popular Magic into a respectably-deep and less random game of the LCG vein.

The "solution" to the mana problem in Magic is the least elegant I've seen. Clunky to a fault. It wouldn't be so bad if the graphic design on the cards weren't so bloody awful, but everything is so so SO white. You can't tell at a glance across the table what mana is important to the other player and what options they have. A little color would go a long way towards that, but then you'd still have to be able to spot what symbol they needed.

The back and forth actions are kind of cute, but I prefer the slam jam all-at-once productive feeling of a Magic turn.

Having so many spells that come out and stay out is... ok I guess. I don't have a strong opinion.

An interesting game. The dice are a very nice iteration on traditional MtG mana. You get the same amount of chance injected into the system, but it's easily modified to whatever you want, so long as you are okay with sacrificing tempo and long term strength. I also like how the dice give you access to a set of minor abilities that can nonetheless heavily influence how a deck plays.

The small card pool and deck size worry me a little. I'd be concerned that with a lot of play, decks could end up getting samey and result in similar board states being endlessly repeated. I've found that situations like that can lead to stagnant, chance dependent metagames. People know what the decks do, they know how they interact with other decks, and the only determiner is whether you get the dice you need to beat the other player to the punch.

Interested in trying the draft variant.

I'm a very big fan of the art as well.

Otro intento de encontrar el juego de dos para darle con mi hermano.

Estamos ante un juego de cartas "ultra novedoso" en su tema. Dos magos se enfrentan en el campo de batalla para intentar eliminar al otro, lo nunca visto oiga. Bueno, tiene lo típico de estos juegos. Se alternan los turnos, eso si de forma rápida. Solo tienes una acción principal y una acción secundaria que básicamente te permitan bajar una carta al tablero (hechizo o criatura) respetando unos límites marcados por tu personaje o atacar con tus criaturas, pudiéndose el otro defenderse con las suyas. Las criaturas y hechizos que usas se gastan para el turno. Las criaturas tienen un valor de ataque, defensa y vida etc ...

Donde están las diferencias? Pues basicamente en que el coste de activación o para bajar cartas son dados mayormente. Además los mazos son bastante reducidos, unas 30 cartas. La caja base viene completa, nada de cartas 1x cuando puedes llevar tres de la misma. Y para cuando controlas un poquito más, tu mano inicial la eliges. Es de tipo LCG pero mucho más controlado, una caja cada cuatro meses o así, pero vamos que con el básico tienes de sobra para un tiempo se supone

Además estéticamente está bastante bien.

While it doesn't do anything new really at all, and is just another MTG knock-off (and is nothing like Netrunner btw) with Mana screw/Rare hunting fixed at the end of the day (though saying that sells it short), what it does do it does [i]very well[/i] indeed

I played this the same night as [i]Allegiance: A Realm Divided[/i], and while on paper Allegiance should be the game I like more (certain aspects are more interesting), execution proved otherwise. This one is more fluid, cleaner rules, better balanced costs, DB options, shorter and really more fun at least so far (new to both). I liked many things here like; stacking spells, some control over the resources, choose starting hand, options but not too many, timing key and at times patience pays off, quick turns & gametime, luck mitigation, uniqueness of each deck, pre-built decks with option to also build and/or draft, great art.  

I appreciate getting enough of the good cards ie. 3 of each from the get-go in 1 core and like their exp. del plan much better than FFG's as well, but it does cut down on the variety of unique cards and thus makes me wish there were just a few more cards in the box to min/max this trade-off.  Having said that most of the cards are universal so there ARE DB options (though with Conjurations you need to match them up with their matching Summon Spells and also you need to ensure dice needed for deck built match up according), and the draft rules sound good to spice things up a little too. (I should note too the discounted USA price is very reasonable and a great value, a shame CAD price and Retailers are far from it). 

Definitely one of the better card dueling games I have played and if balance seems good through more play rating could rise, for now it will soon find a spot on my overburdened shelves

Great out of the (base) box. Not the greatest card diversity compared to FFG LCGs from the get go, but the game is so smooth and well playing that you easily forgive it. Its a duel game like magic, but since you have full mana potential out of the gate, it becomes a different game entirely. It is a lot about timing and resource management in the duel, a skirmish that feels more like Hearhstone than Magic. Highly recommended

Rated after 7 plays.  FFG may have put out more LCG product but Plaid Hat knows how to do a core set right - smaller card pool with max copies for every included card and viable, interesting base decks.  I've played with all but two of the included decks and against the ones I haven't played and found all the archetypes distinct and interesting.  Play is tense with a lot of decision-making.  This game is so good.

Further praise on the release schedule, with new content arriving 5 months after release and every 3 months thereafter, rather than every month ala FFG.  

11/9 - Knocked down to 8 slightly as precon balance isn't as good as it first appeared.  Still a great game.

I was looking for a decent card dueling game and wanted absolutely nothing to do with CCGs.  The dice as resources mechanic is interesting and new and the art is absolutely amazing.  Gameplay-wise it fell a bit flat for us trying to cobble together multiple decks out of a single core set.  Similarly to a CCG, we ended up not really wanting to chase down cards by buying multiple core sets and packs and thus moved on.  A hidden gem of a game called 'Allegiance: A Realm Divided' ended up suiting our needs for the card dueling genre.

3 player learning game. Stevie won in a tight match, playing Jessa.
I outlasted Mike, who was playing (Pah! I forget her name right now...the Pink Rose chick. ;)  ).
I used the big brute. His Iron Rhinos are great, but a tad inviting...they were picked on, incessantly. I understand why; they pack a whallop.

Fantastic initial experience... we eagerly anticipate more and see all the potential.

A real winner and instant favorite.

An awesome game. Dueling mages game that get rids of mana curve concept, replacing it with dice, mitigates luck of the draw by allowing you to choose your opening hand (within limits) and implements 'draw up to hand size' rule and...
Great artwork as well.

This game has potential to grow big if Plaid Hat supports it properly.
It does face one big obstacle: there. are. so. many. good. 2p. dueling. card. games. already!

If it gets good support, this game might even get a higher score. And Plaid Hat has supported their cardgames very well so far (Summoner Wars anyone?)

fantastic duelling card game. Tactically rich, Phenomenal card balance, and gorgeous artwork.

It has obvious comparisons to magic the gathering, however in this one: you choose your opening, you have 10 energy from turn 1, and it has single action turns that really keep both players engaged through out the game.

From what I've heard the deck construction aspect is very solid too, just not required. The game is easy to learn and plays pretty quickly.

A solid two player dueling game in the same vein as Netrunner or Magic the Gathering.  It features highly thematic decks and a unique resource system involving dice.  Rather than ramping access to resources, you start with a fixed pool that you can increase in small degrees.  Conjure decks mean you alway have access to units and the ready spell system is very unique in this style of game.  Plagued by growing pains as PHG is acquired two years in a row, hoping this sees a resurgence soon.

Szeretem a Magicet, és tagadhatatlan, hogy vannak rokoni szálak közöttük. Rengeteg nagyon jó ötlet van az Ashesben, és elég letisztultnak érzem, egyértelműek a szabályok. Kiváló az alapdoboz tartalma, a hat alappakli igen magas újrajátszhatóságot biztosít, de mondjuk a kockahiány már az első kiegészítő megvásárlásánál gondot okozhat. Ez a kockás erőforrás mutatós, de azért egyértelműen behoz egy plusz szerencseforrást, mert a szimbólumok között erősségi különbség van.
Mivel én alapjáraton is szeretem az ilyen jellegű kártyajátékokat, kedvelem az Ashest is, a minimalista dizájn a gyönyörű illisztrációkkal tényleg kimagasló vizuális élményt nyújt.
Ugyanakkor ezekben a kártyajátékokban nagyon jelentős eltérések lehetnek a játszmákban. Van, hogy kialakul egy izgalmas, kiélezett csata, máskor viszont csak simán bedarálja az egyik fél a másikat. Ez nyilván kevésbé izgalmas. Hosszú távon a két különböző élmény aránya határozza meg a játék általános megítélését. Meglátjuk. :)

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Ashes: Rise of the Pheonixborn:[/b][/size]
- The game lacks meaningful decisions because of the dice / rolling mechanism and the fact that there are no ways to mitigate bad dice rolls. 
- I am not a fan of the generic fantasy theme
- I think that the balance of the game is off. Some of the starter decks seem superior to other starter decks. I particularly did not like the smaller limit on monsters for some of the characters as this made them weak. I could have just sucked at the game so keep this in mind.
- The meaningfulness of your decisions could be improved if they abolished the luck rolling dice. The long duration of the game does not help. 
- I prefer other two-player battle card games.

A game that benefits form multiple plays and the game offers lots of replay value with the different characters. This is however a very agressive game, and that is almost always a negative for me.

In Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn, a two-player expandable card game, players take on the roles of Phoenixborns, demi-gods and protectors of this world. These characters are the great saviors of their civilizations. Before they came into existence, the humans were plagued by monsters like chimeras that took away their lands and forced them to live in walled-off cities. When the Phoenixborns came, they fought off the chimeras and freed the lands for humans to take over once again.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

The art is first rate and impressive. The game play feels pretty solid although the luck of the die roll can be exasperating (but managed to some degree with a side action). I'm not sure this is really much more than a two player game though. Dice play a role in casting spells whether it be attack, reaction, conjuration, etc. Drafting looks to make the game even more intriguing and this one, if popular, looks to become quite the collectible card game most likely.

Wir haben glaub alle recht lange gebraucht, bis wir wussten, wie wir unser Deck spielen mussten. Das Spiel ist recht einfach zu lernen, aber schwer zu meistern.
Mir ist es immernoch zu textlastig. Ich kenne jetzt mein Deck mit dem ich spiele, bei dem von den anderen Spielern kenn ich die Karten die mich nerven können bzw. von weiteren Völkern hab ich keine Ahnung, nur dass man sie nicht angreifen darf und wenn, dann auf einen Schlag killen!
Leider spielen wir solche "großen und langen" Spiele zu selten, als dass man sich an Decks gewöhnen könnte, geschweige denn sich selbst mal eines zu bauen.
Spiele es gerne nochmal mit. Gutes Spiel, mir nur zu lang und zu textig.

A great head-to-head card game.
The dice effects are a nice addition to the game and add to a number of choices available to players. This also is problematic as the game seems to gravitate to a status-quo in a zero sum game.

The publisher is acting pretty weird. The cards they release are associated with a specific character, I'd like to see a generic card pool expansion.

Best. Battle Card Game. Ever.

Extremely well designed with NO "buy to win mechanism". No booster packs, and you never buy more than one copy of a set. This game is made by people who just earnestly wanted to make a good game at a fair price. Ashes is competitive and has a random elements (dice and card draw) but there are options in the game to completely mitigate random occurrences creating interesting decisions instead of option-less frustration. 

Toss your money sucking CCG or LCG out and get into Ashes!

Comments entered on 28 July 2015:

I pre-ordered Ashes and received it on 27 July 2015. It is not often that I get a game and rate it the next day because it usually takes a little longer than that to get the minimum four plays before I rate a game. Currently, my rating is 4.66 but I placed this on my list to play 100 games this year back when the only information I had was from the pre-order articles on Plaid Hat Games' website. After just 24 hours, I think that I may have had a good sense on what to expect from this game.

Sometimes it's the simple things. Simpler is almost always better. That's Ashes, simple, but brilliant.

Take a factionless game, add smaller decks, short play, and you're almost there. Add a dice-based resource system that lets you completely manipulate it at any time, and you complete it.

First, Ms Suarez, I'm in LOVE. You're one hell of an artist, and you have my attention; well even more than DoW, but now I'm fully locked in. Something like this needs to be captivating, and you've made women everywhere happy with 4 of the 6 Phoenixborns completely powerful, but not over sexualized, women. BRAVO. 

So the system is rounds of back and forth actions until each passes. You play stuff, you attack with stuff, etc. I know it sounds mundane, but factor in the ability to manipulate your dice, however, your deck is so-very-finite at a scant 30 cards. It's amazing how much play can be had in a tiny deck size. The modes of play are here too; the draft is dead brilliant.

If you get the chance, play a demo. If you like lcgish games, you'll likely fall for this one. It'll even fit in to your economy with a slower release schedule. I have a feeling releases, though fewer, will have more value since every card is meaningful to any build. There is no chaff in this game, and no limits.

Really wanted to like this game, but it's mired in card interactions that require you to intimately know not only all of your own cards, but those of your opponent, and those cards are upside down and across the table. Knowing what to play and why is difficult to grasp, and even harder to teach someone else. Card triggers are hard to follow and easily missed during game play. Somewhat reminds me of Warhammer Invasion, Star Wars LCG and Lord of the Rings LCG... all games I either dislike or don't play anymore. I suppose if you're a serious CCG or LCG gamer with Magic background this may come a little easier, but I found it frustrating and finally gave up. Too bad; the art and design is stunning.

RATING: 7
Very good 'sealed deck' game, as in the line of Summoner Wars. A few concerns though:
1. Despite having 6 starter decks, the replayability still seems to be a problem as there is not a great variety of cards in each deck (only 10) and the strategy of deck matching, though seems varied vs different opponents, the variation is still somewhat limited as there is only 10 cards each.
2. It is extremely difficult to remove tough creatures as the phoenixborn can block attackers even when exhausted, which, could make some decks extremely powerful and sure win if no mistake was made by the player.
In contrary to many fellow geeks who compare this game to Magic the Gathering, this game actually is more similar to Mage Wars Arena. But Mage Wars offers at least 4 times more fun with double play time.

Got this game for free (rewards points from my employer). Still think I may have paid too much after reading the rules. I don't see anything here that someone hasn't already done. Broken decks? I have Berserk for that. Mage vs. Mage combat? I have Mage Wars Academy for that. Multi-player combat card game? I have Epic for that. Rolling dice to determine resources for the turn? I have DiceMasters for that. Standard CCG-style card game? I have original VS for that.

I only got this game because it seemed everyone was raving about how "different" it is. So far it just seems like the poor man's MtG with elements cribbed from other games.

[addendum after 1 play]

There's a bit more strategy here than I'd anticipated, mostly in resource accumulation/allocation (when and how do I use the resources provided by the dice, since a round lasts until both players pass).

The flavor text on the cards is positively cringeworthy.

[addendum after 2 plays]

God, this is such a DULL game. Arwen Windfarter casts a spell to create a snake creature to attack Loren Nounverber, but his enchanted animated armor blocks the attack! Yawn. Again, every time I play this game the theme/mechanics remind me of six or seven other games that do the same thing 20x better and in a third (or less) of the playing time.

I'm SO freaking SORRY that I didn't use my reward points on The Duke instead of this wretched poor man's MtG.

[happy ending addendum]

Bought the last copy of The Duke (now OOP) from the LGS, so at least THAT regret is laid to rest.

Doesn't make me hate Ashes any less though. Dropped it to a 3. I may play it again, but I'll have to be REEEEEEEEEALLY bored. Like "stuck in a hospital bed for days with literally nothing else to do except bleed out and ring for a bedpan" bored.

RATING: 5
This game errs on the "fixed mana" side. While I don't think mana screw/flood is a desirable feature in any design, everything is too readily available between fixed mana and card cycling. 

Moreover, the decks all scream their theme. Each deck does one thing and does it well, with all the cards seemingly designed for that deck. As a result, you don't feel like you are discovering anything clever; It was built right in with day-glo markers, and you can get to combo peices you need with relatively little hassle. Drafting might help, but we didn't get grabbed enough to try. 

In short, the design lacks tension. 

Art is gorgeous, theme and play very familiar, and the rules just different enough from MTG that I have trouble remembering what the differences are. If I visited this game enough, I'm sure I'd get them straight. But our games haven't had enough zing to get it back to the table. 

In retrospect, this game might have gained much going with a deck jam method like Smash Up uses.

I'm not a fan of Magic The Gathering and so the idea of playing a card game in that vein was a hard sell for me, but I'm really happy I gave this game a chance.  

Why I like this game as opposed to Magic:

A) It's more standardized, while some players might not like this, this is a positive feature to me as it makes the game more approachable in my opinion.  While you can mix the cards from one Phoenixborns decks in to your own, to make a custom hand, the game comes with pre-built decks for each character.  Also, you don't have to worry about new game elements or mechanics, what you get in the box is what the game is going to be.

B) Each character and their deck truly feels unique, with their own strengths and weaknesses.  Between the 6 decks in the base game, there's a deck that should work well for players of all strategy and tactic types and I'm sure 1 will emerge as your favorite.

C) The decks are well balanced.  I've yet to play a game where one deck/Phoenixborn is clearly superior to another.  They all feel like they have the ability to win or lose to another, so it really comes down to you as the player recognizing how to adapt to your opponents decks and strategy.

D) This game doesn't take a large investment to build a great deck like Magic does.  You buy the base game and that's it, it's all you need.  All the expansions are just new Phoenixborn and their decks.  There's no need to buy them though, to "keep up with" other players or play by new rules or new game play elements/mechanics, it's purely optional and would only be advised if you feel one of the expansion Phoenixborn suits your playstyle.

E) The artwork in this game is easily some of the most beautiful game artwork out there.  The game is a treat to the eyes.  My girlfriend and I, have on a number of occasions, had people come up to us in our favorite local coffee shop and favorite bar, just to ask what game we were playing, as between the artwork on the cards and the colorful dice, it's very appealing to look at.


This has become one of my favorite games and not just because I've won the last 5 out of 6 matches, much to my GF's chagrin, but because the game just feels so well balanced and the matches feel very close and tense.

Rating based on 2 players.

Still very much a newbie at this, and I doubt I will ever be proficient at it, but I like this game quite a bit. Despite my general dislike of card games with constantly changing rules, I'm okay with it here because there are only two sets of cards to keep track of (and once you become familiar with the cards it would be even easier, though I'm not at that point yet), and cards often stick round for quite a while. In addition, your goals remain the same, even if how you can get there changes. But I digress...

The importance of timing your attacks and actions gives this game an interesting back-and-forth, where success/failure can depend just as much on when you do something as what you do in the first place. The use of dice gives the game a "gaaah if only I had enough for another action!" feeling, yet also lets you summon strong cards right from the get-go. The duplication of ready spells gives a good sense of escalation as well, as conjurations become more and more powerful.

I enjoy the individuality of the art of the phoenixborn decks and how each plays differently (I haven't played with customized decks, and am not particularly interested in that aspect). Also, while female representation isn't a dealbreaker for me personally, I appreciate it when companies do have it and Ashes' got it in spades.

I'm writing this as I am midway through my first solo play to get the game down, and that should give you an idea right there how I feel about the game.

I'm not really sure how much I like the base game as is right now. Certainly it isn't built for 4-player games out of the box as easy as I would like, but potentially of what this game could be down the road? Mind blown. I'm even a PHG fanboy and knew of the hype, but I didn't see where it would stand out in a land of expandable card games, so I avoided it until Black Friday hit and I figured what the heck. I'm playing Mage Wars Arena next, but boy is it going to take a lot to prevent this from being my #2 new to me for 2015.

A stunning looking card game that takes a few tropes from Magic the Gathering and adds in an interesting dice mechanic to generate your Mana.

Owed but sold after only a play. There isn't a system of deckbuilding. With 30 cards 3 copy for each card there are only 10 different cards. But you have to start with 5 different cards. So you have the 50% of the own deck in hands. You could will draw 5 different cards.
System of fight nice but not original. In general the experience hasn't fun.

Just had a chance to play, and it blew me away.  It sounded fun reading about it, and was even more fun than it sounded.  This is bar none the most interesting Magic-clone I've played.  Different enough that it almost makes me feel dirty calling it a clone.  I've never loved the Magic style games, but I've usually enjoyed them for a little.  This was an entirely different experience, where I can't stop thinking about it.  It's not "Summoner Wars good", but it's not really the same style of game as Summoner Wars either.  I make this comparison only because the game will be compared to Summoner Wars because of the publisher/theme.

Ashes is a decent Magic imitator. They're similar enough that you'll probably like Ashes if you already like Magic, but different enough that you can enjoy Ashes on its own merits. The dice smooth some of the mana issues people dislike about Magic, but they're still random enough that you'll have turns when you're cursing your luck as well as those turns you tend to forget when you were ridiculously fortunate. Without the arc of an ever-growing pool of mana, turns are flatter, giving you more options at the beginning but never providing for those big splashy plays in the late game.

If you're looking for a card dueling alternative to buying pre-constructed decks for Magic, then you could do worse than Ashes, but you could also do better. Blue Moon Legends is about the same price, has more decks, plays more quickly, and actually feels more different from Magic than Ashes does. But if you've got any willingness to make decks yourself for casual play, you'll get far more variety from Magic than from either of these games. It's cheaper too; perfectly fine Commons and Uncommons can be as little as a penny each, so it's a cinch to come up with a half dozen affordable decks.

Here are the equivalents I see between Ashes and Magic decks:

* Noah = WU Tempo
* Saria = UB Control (Milling)
* Jessa = BR Midrange (Suicide, Burn)
* Coal = RG Aggro (Beatdown)
* Maeoni = GW Midrange (+1/+1 Counters)
* Aradel = GW Midrange (Go Wide/Big)

Basically, that's a deck for each allied color pair straight out of a Magic Core Set, plus an extra one for GW.

The card interactions felt very tit-for-tat-ish.  I play a card, opponent plays a card to discard it.  I put a token on a unit, opponent plays a card that remove the token.  I remove an opponent's die, they play a card to get it back.  It was so frustrating and zero-sum: +1, -1, +2, -2, -1, +1 .... 

Clearly this game doesn't suit my gaming tastes.  But it was beautiful, easy to learn, easy to play, and possibly one of the best games of this type - I dunno, though, it's not for me.

Not very good at playing this... yet.  Beautiful and fun to play.  I also bought lovely acrylic tokens from Team Covenant and sewed bags for the tokens and dice.  I have played it a good number of times— the dice are an interesting twist with the deck building.  I am working my way through the pre-built decks at this point and see no end to enjoying the game anytime in the near future.

I'm not going to give this one a rating as it's clear that deck building games are not my thing.

Bought this one out of enthusiasm for Plaid Hat and Isaac Vega, along with the nice art. 

We gave it a fair crack, but I felt like just about every single move required a perusal of the rules. Too fiddly to be fun for us.

I like everything about this game. Even with the default decks it's excellent as they each feel very different. I have played easily well over 100 games with my Girlfriend and we still want to keep playing. Neither of us has managed a win with Noah however.

RATING: 5
I wasn't sure what to expect going in aside from the fact that this was yet another game trying to capture the theme of MTG in a more modernized way. After reading the rule book, I was very excited. This game seemed to have a lot of the trimmings of a great MTG variant, but unfortunately the execution was less than stellar. I think this game is going to appeal more to those who want to concoct a grand strategy into a dueling mages game rather than act and counteract your opponent's moves. Whereas MTG is all about compiling a deck of a variety of resources to draw from, Ashes is about compiling a deck of a few spells in large quantities. For me, this was a little jarring, and as a result, I didn't care for the game that much. Even the dice being your mana pool, which I thought had huge potential, ended up being more of a gimmick than anything else. This is yet another example of how Plaid Hat disappoints me time and time again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
It seemed pretty simple.  Almost all of the time, the right decision was pretty obvious, and the lack of being able to play spells on the opponent's turn means you can't actually do very much to stop your opponent.  Drawing up to full hand size meant that card advantage doesn't matter, so you just want to use as many of your cards as possible most of the time.

If I liked deck building, I think I could have loved this game. PvP is not something I am super into but there a lot of interesting ideas here. The custom dice are great and you could probably play just buying and using the character decks as you recieve them rather building personal decks. I'd give this one another look but it just isn't the type of game I play.

This game is great! If I wasn't already in Netrunner so deep, I think I'd pick it up and begin playing it competitively.

The art is a nice fantasy art and I like the white borders, I don't care what anyone says.

Based on a handful of plays it is interesting, the art is fantastic and consistent throughout.  I personally would have liked some color in the graphic design, especially in the icons as they are hard to see across the table and to recognize at a glance.  I don't know if I will bother with deck building as that is a deep rabbit hole to go down.  I love the first five mechanism where you choose your opening hand, not completely sold on the whole package.

[b]Ashes: Rise of the Phoenixborn[/b] was sold via auction 11/5/15.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]My intial thoughts held true and Ashes didn’t see another play before being sold. To summerize my previous problems with the game I didn’t find the decks well balanced against each other making deckbuilding a priority. I appreciate even more the excellent job Plaid Hat did balancing the different factions in Summoner Wars where deckbuilding wasn’t a necessity. Also, at least with the initial factions, strategies seemed very straight forward if played with the prebuilt decks. All in all I really liked the mana system, but for me Summoner Wars is hands down the superior game.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]May be my biggest disappointment of 2015 so far. I'm keeping my comments short and sweet on this one. First off I love the use of dice in this game to manage your mana, but you can get hosed if your playing a deck that has a lot of top tier mana requirements. Yes you can discard a card to change a die value, but that is costly and you really can't afford to keep doing that throughout the game. Still I had fun managing my dice pool, but is something to be aware of going in. 

I have 1 major gripe with the game though. I do not enjoy deckbuilding, especially in games I'm playing with my kids. I knew going in that was a big part of this game, but I expected the base factions to be better balanced against one another. Summoner Wars, (another PH game) is extremely well balanced when playing just the base faction decks. In Ashes some decks will more often than not get destroyed by other decks and I'm not interested in figuring out how to balance the base game decks. I'm not a fan of the LCG model, but as with Summoner Wars, I would have been happy buying new factions that I wanted if I thought PH was making efforts to balance all of the basic decks. 

I have one other minor conern, after a few plays with each deck strategies become apparent and games become very samey. Again I realize that building decks alleviates this, but I expected more variety, balance and replay value from the basic decks in Ashes (Imperial Settlers pulls this off exceptionally well so it can be done).[/i]

心得:
玩過兩個腳色而已
基本上資源就是10顆骰
因為可以棄牌換骰面，所有骰到的結果影響不大
生物招喚多是透過場上的咒語書來做
所以手牌的使用不會太多，且每回合會回到5張
重點應該是快速抽出你要的combo來對打
不過第一場的經驗腳色強弱好像有差
規則:
*每人選一個牌組，主角牌放前面，起始手牌從牌庫選5張不一樣的剩下洗勻，招喚物排放一旁，拿10顆骰跟對應的骰表放一旁，每個玩家有一個咒語區跟戰場區(最前方)，可放卡牌數字看主角牌
*遊戲進行數輪，每輪有三個階段，直到擊倒對方的主角
1.準備階段 玩家同時擲使用區骰，第一次擲最多基本符號的拿起始，之後可棄任意數量牌，手牌補到五張(此時沒有牌抽一張扣一滴主角血)
2.玩家回合階段 每人一定要做一個主要行動跟可執行一個次要行動，順序隨便，直到兩個人都跳過才進入下一階段
>主要行動 
a.打需要主要行動符號的卡片，或是啟動需要主動符號的卡片
*打牌根據上方右下放置對應位置或棄掉，其他花費有，放使用標記/主行動/次行動/棄牌/支付骰點等，反應牌可在對方回合符合條件下打，裝備牌則放到指定單位下，準備咒語則放到咒語區，有多張時疊起並啟動focus效果(兩張1三張2)，且每張可分開結算啟動
b.攻擊對手主角
c.攻擊對手一個生物單位
*攻擊都先選一起攻擊的單位，在選目標，如果打主角該玩家可用自己單位幫忙阻擋，1個單位擋1個，如果被攻擊單位可改用主角幫擋或是有防禦特性的腳色代替被打(阻擋腳色不能有使用標記)，所有攻擊單位造成攻擊後放一個使用標記，防禦方如果是單位可選擇回擊，如果回擊則雙方互打，有回擊才要放使用標記，如果是幫擋傷害可自由分配
*受傷放傷害標記，傷害大於血量則放到棄牌區，直接放傷害標記的咒語不能被防止傷害牌阻止
*respark 有此能力的牌如果要從場上進棄牌堆可支付費用回手
d.跳過
>次要行動
a.打需要次要行動符號的卡片或啟動能力
b.棄任意張數牌(手牌，牌庫，咒語區牌)來轉對應個數的骰子到你要的面
c.使用骰子能力，看骰表
3.回復階段 每個有回復能力的單位回血，移除使用標記，可將沒使用的任意顆骰放到使用區，然後換起始玩家
***組牌規則***
>預組  選一個主角，選30張牌組成牌庫，每種最多3張，腳色特定卡只有一些腳色可用，選10顆骰，根據選擇的牌拿對應的招喚牌形成招喚牌庫(右下有上限)
>輪抽 每個腳色跟跟限定卡疊起，將所有其他牌選一張洗勻成牌庫，骰子放一旁，隨機起始每人先選一個角色跟拿對應限定卡，將其他牌庫發給每人9張，每次選1張保留輪抽到9張選完，在照順位每人選2顆骰直到10顆，在開其他牌庫等同玩家人數張牌，每人可用一張手牌換一次，之後拿手中9張牌的同樣額外兩張，組成30張牌，然後拿對應招喚物卡

Great duelling game. The different characters take a little getting used to but once you hit it, the different themes really show and it turns into great fun.

Will be interesting to see how deck building works out with this game.

Just increased it slightly. It's my favourite duelling game at the moment. I love how tactical it can be and tense players get trying to figure out the best moves they can do. Chosing the starting hand, whilst just a detail, is a big deal for me and really makes a big difference. 

Great game.

I traded it away when they started making erratas and I prmised to never have more than one collectible game in my collection.

I was not super excited about this game when I first heard about it. I thought, "Another battling card game from Plaid Hat? I don't need another one". I also thought it would be too MTG like, and I am not an MTG fan. Well, I don't know what makes this game so fun, but I really like it. I don't play competitively or anything, but I have enjoyed every game I have played even if I lost. The dice mana system is really nice, and I love that there are ways to mitigate poor rolling. You should really give this game a try if you are a fan of these sort of 2 player dueling card games.

I got to play this at my local meetup and I am glad that I did get to play this.

The game system is a mixture of Magic the Gathering and Hearthstone with a dice system for mana. The objective is to kill off the other player(s). I can't see how this is not a 2-player only game. If played at 3+, it will have too much politicking and it will not be fun (in my opinion).

I get to play the necromancer girl and her spells/troops really came together thematically. This is a solid thematic game that comes well together. To judge if it is balanced or not would have to come with more plays.

Very nice artwork. A big plus of this is that almost everything is clear. During our 1 play, there was only 1 issue (the Gaze ability of the Blue Jaguar). In most of these type of games (like Epic) there is a lot of downtime as you have questions on how things interact or what a certain term just means. Here there was just that single problem. With already 6 decks you also have a good variety from the base game already.

(disclaimer: after only one game) It's not a bad game, but not remarkable either. Very repetitive and one-dimensional - part of it is because of the limited card pool, which may thus get better as expansions are released, but part of it is that there is no sense of escalation to the game. The resource-over-time curve is a flat line: you start with 10 dice, end with 10 dice, you can manipulate them fairly easy to get the faces you need. So resource management is very one-dimensional... Card & effect cost distribution is very monotonic, mostly between 1-3 dice, which means you'll get to do around 4-8 things in a round, every round. What you do in the first round is very similar to what you do in the last round. And the alternating turns seems like a good idea to reduce downtime, but also means there is no way to string cards and effects together to surprise your opponent, since he can react to everything you do, which contributes to the flat-lineness, monotonic, repetitive feel of the game. Not a bad game, but as far as head-to-head card games go, this is bottom shelf...

I thought there was a lot to like when we opened this. The card art is really nice, and the "white" base colouring gives the game a very clean theme. Card quality is also great, as you'd expect. Rules were reasonably easy to learn too. All female mages, was a great thing too. Everything just looks great!
BUT, we didn't like it. We randomly picked two mages to play, and the game balance was just horrendous with the starter decks. Seriously, every creature I had had 2 HP or less. My opponent had an ability allowing her to kill creatures of 2HP. Maybe she just took the complete counterpick to my mage? Regardless, I knew the game was over within a few minutes. But I was hoping maybe I had some kind of card to help out my situation. Turns out - no I didn't. 
Maybe there is a game here, if you try other mages and buy expansions. But I'm not going to try. I've played other CCGs/LCGs in the past and present. If you screw up starter decks, then you really guarantee that a lot of potential customers will not buy in after they try out the game. And you can put me into that list of people.

Think of it as a MtG but the turn is called round and during each turn only one primary action is allowed making it more dynamic than Magic.
Mana is determined by dices at the beginning of the turn of both players making it a bit too much luck based but the cards aren't that strong so one (or even 2) bad round won't let you lose the game (and there are ways to fix bad dices).

06-09-2015. Rated after about 5 plays. Second time I write this because BGG apparently didn't save my comments on Ashes.

It is with heavy heart that I admit that Ashes was disappointing for me. It's very much Magic the Gathering light, with dice. And sadly, apparently that's not a combination I enjoy, while I like the constituents a lot.

In Ashes, you play a Phoenixborn, a magic user with a deck of cards, very similar to MtGs Planeswalkers. Each round, you roll 10 dice and spend the resources those dice give (in symbols) as part of your actions. Each turn, you have one full action and 1 side action to spend resources on. You play creatures, buy cards, manipulate dice. It's all quite ok. There are fun twists, Ashes has spellbooks and conjurations, creatures you can always summon for permanent locations. However, that is not as dissimilar from Magic with token-making enchantments.

All in all, Ashes feels very derivative. The artwork is nice, and the conjuration idea is nifty. I like that tried something in a genre that is 'as' competative, and I like that they tried it with dice. Ultimately, it falls flat for me because of three main reasons I think.

1. In my mind, the game is derivative of Magic and does not significantly improve/change the design.
2. The card effects seem small. This makes the the playing of cards generic and unexciting.
3. Two actions on your turn makes sure it never spirals out of control.

All in all, I feel what Ashes does has been done and better. I prefer to play both Magic, or Netrunner and at least a couple of other LCGs to this game.

WOW!  I mean, WWOOOOOOOWWW!!  When I first started playing this game I was a little confused (I come from MtG experience here) but once I got the concepts and saw what cards I had in my deck, the combos, strategies, and stuff just blew me away.  So much richness!  Granted, I've only played one game so far, but it definitely has me wanting to come back!

P.S. The art also blew me away.  It's awesome!

P.P.S. Man, the games are REALLY LONG for us.  Not sure if that is normal since we are still learning.  But wow!

RATING: 8
The art and production quality of this game is fantastic. The USPs of this game (namely dice as a manapool, quick turn system and the progressive gameplay) are great, but I'm still undecided if I like the very restricted actions one can take each turn. Not being mana starved/flooded is great, but I often have the feeling I can only utilize a subset of the tools at my disposal because of the combination of the exhaustion, main/side-action and attack mechanics. Trade-offs are great and make for interesting gameplay choices, but in this game it feels a bit to constricted. I have to play more matches though.

Beautiful to look at and those chunky dice are so satisfying to roll. The resource management using dice is interesting, timing is more crucial than cards, and each character plays differently. However, deck management is very limited and there's no element of a "sideboard" or specific cards to fight other characters. Combat is a mess with the targeting/blocking of phoenixborn or creatures unclear. MTG did it better with the Planeswalkers/creatures.

I'm not big on 1v1 card games, but this one is pretty enjoyable. It's easy to play out of the box and all the different characters play differently from each other. The only negative the bf and I have is that if you want to have multiple people play, it becomes a pain of choosing which 4 characters you can actually play as because how dice are split up. They sell extra dice on Plaid Hat's website, but it would be nice to have a retail option since their store has very bad shipping costs.

RATING: 6.5
Ashes is a more methodical dueling mages style of game than most, with players taking turns taking actions. The way that the different types of mana give you different special abilities and the way the spellboard allows you to repeatedly play certain effects round after round are both interesting differences from other games of this style. I really like the ability to start with an opening hand of your choice, and the way that you refill your hand every round. I'm not as big a fan of how easy it is to chump block, which makes it much more difficult to make good use of large units.

When teaching the game to others, they might find it a bit intimidating at first, but it's actually pretty simple once you have played a round. The artwork is stunning, and the gameplay is fast and fun. Each of the Phoenixborn seem to play quite differently, so we are expecting to get quite a few plays just from the base recommended decks before we start tinkering with drafting custom decks.

This is a card battler that can be played with up to four players.  I had been interested in this game ever since I first saw a demo of it and got a copy from my BGG Secret Santa.

The gameplay is very similar to Dice Masters.  2-4 players try to get all the others down to zero life.  They have a deck of cards they constructed beforehand filled with creatures and spells and the resources for playing those are determined by dice rolls.  I was a fan of Dice Masters but didn't want to invest the money into a collectible system so this really intrigued me.

It's just okay.  I like the idea of using dice as your resources.  That's what drew me to it and that's still good.  I even like that along with cards that can alter your dice there is a rule where players can ditch cards to alter their dice.  This is a heavy cost since a deck is only 30 cards and there are very few ways to get discarded cards back but at least it gives players an option to alter their dice at any time.

I think my biggest issue with this game is what actually comes in the package.  Like I said above, a deck is 30 cards.  The game comes with enough cards to build 6 decks, one for each combination of the 4 dice types that come in the base set.  Each deck is 3 copies of 10 different cards.  Even with trying all 6 characters that is not a lot of content in my opinion.  Only seeing 10 different cards from a card battler doesn't really give a player a lot of options or variety, which is one of the keys to this type of game being successful.  You can build your own decks but adding cards outside of the 30 included for a set of 2 dice types means you have to reach into a third or fourth dice type which can cause resource issues.  And even still, there's not much content within this initial offering to explore very far.  And even if there were, 30 cards seems a bit restrictive.

Past that there are a few points where I feel the product and intention don't match.  Based on the small deck size and reasonably simple and accessible rules this feels like it is meant to be a fast card battler, which was intriguing at first as while I love something like Mage Wars, that's a 2+ hour game.  But it doesn't go that quickly.  Even with two players, once boards are full the game plays with back-and-forth turns taking a single main and/or side action until both players run out and pass.  This can take quite a while, especially since while you can attack with all your creatures at once with one action, it actually makes more sense to attack with them one at a time.  When a player has 8 creatures on their board this can make the game drag.

And really, while it can play up to 4, I don't think it is meant to play more than 2.  Each deck is 30 cards and like I said above, there are few ways to retrieve cards from your discard.  With more than 2 players not only do rounds drag even longer but with attention split and 1 or 2 more people needing to be brought down to 0 life the decks empty much quicker.  And if someone is left with no deck left just slowly taking draw damage but with no new cards to play, that can be really not fun.

This isn't a bad game.  The card abilities seem varied and balanced and well designed.  The dice and how it is managed by the game are nice as well.  I just think it drags a lot for what it is and doesn't really offer the variety and legs that a game like this needs.  Sure, expansions can remedy that some but it doesn't do enough to make me want to wait.

I will say though, the artwork for this game is incredible.  But if you are going to sell a game like this, sell it with a better insert and dividers to organize the cards.

RATING: 3
I have a lot of positive comments about this game: beautiful, dynamic, tensed.
I have one negative comment, important enough to lower the mark to 6: The game forces you to deckbuild. I think it should be left to choice. I play almost all those games using the prebuilt decks and usually can get very far. Here, base decks are too thin with only a few cards in 3 copies, which means that the strategies of each faction quickly becomes obvious and repetitive. Also, the starting factions are not balanced with several poor matchups. 
It's not everyone who likes to create a deck at home and try it against an opponent who also has to do the same 
(and also needs to have bought the game...). I prefer a game that already proposes deep, tested decks for me to enjoy using the different possible matchups that are constantly augmented through expansions.

EDIT: Expansions did not help at all. The deck are still as shallow as they ever were. Lowered to 3. Sold.

When my husband told me that he was buying this A:RotP, he kept talking really fast, throwing in words like "value" and "good rating" and "people say", as if he suspected that when it arrived my nose would slowly crinkle in disdain and disappointment. Sure enough... It just really does not look like something I'd enjoy. (It doesn't help that some of the art/theme is very much not my style.) If anyone wants to look at my game ratings, see what I like, and talk me into why I might like Ashes, I'm sure my husband would be very grateful. Right now, it seems that he's going to have to wait until one of our few game-loving friends comes to visit. 

UPDATE (13 April 2016): The Ashes "Watch It Played" episode convinced my husband that he had made a mistake and that he didn't want to play it either. But then Shut Up & Sit Down's video overview made us *both* change our minds. I'm almost looking forward to playing now, and I've even come around on the art. (Look, I know it's technically quite beautiful, but dramatic fantasy poses that seem to take themselves quite seriously make me eyeroll. I'm a hater like that. However, mice will tug my heartstrings every time.)

LAST UPDATE (17 April 2016): Nope. Nope, nope. But it would be unfair for me to rate something that is so completely unsuitable for me while obviously being great and harmless for others (cilantro haters, take note!), so I'll leave it at this.

Ashes presents another worthy addition to the the crowded list of good two-player, asymmetrical, LCG games. Unfortunately, that there are so many good games like this out there, will be one of its only drawbacks. Unfortunate, because this game is excellent. 

It will be appreciated both by newcomers to two player card games and veterans alike. It does not impress necessarily on its uniqueness in theme or mechanics, appearing not that original. However, as you delve into the details of this game, it offers a powerfully subtle mixture of innovations and improvements to standard mechanics that make this game both simple to pick up and presents a tremendous amount of depth. I think this game, unlike others, requires a closer look where the genius becomes more apparent in the nuances. For example, things that I liked:
- Pick your starting hand
- Spells that stack and become more powerful
- Limitless conjurations
- Dice as resources
- Back and forth turns strike a nice balance between tactical play and strategic play over the course of a round

Ashes goes in my collection as it represents a fitting second LCG game to me. I play Netrunner which is time-consuming and a money commitment. Ashes enables me to play a first-rate LCG without the same investment (the card pool will not be as large and the releases will be more spread out), while still giving me an excellent head to head experience with variability and replayability that will only get better with time.

Card-battle game in the same vein as Magic: The Gathering or Mage Wars. It's not collectible and no plans for a set rotation have been announced so it's already blowing Magic out of the water. It has multiple copies of every card in the box so there's no need to buy multiple copies of the base set for deck creation. It even comes with six playable decks right out of the box.

The only issue I've had with the base game was it doesn't quite have enough dice to play multiplayer using only one set. I once had to play with three Phoenixborn that used illusion dice and had to substitute another type for illusion dice.

Very enjoyable after first few games played with my 9 yr old son. Simple enough rules if you've played similar games (we play Mage Wars Academy). Love the variety of characters, and am actually not currently interested in breaking out of the pre-built decks, as I like that they are all unique. The dice system is fun, and does not make the game as luck-based as one would think, owing to other to other in-game mechanics. Beautiful artwork, refreshing character types and eclectic battle units (mice with gold paintbrushes, voodoo dolls or magical violinists anyone?)

Highly recommended for all geeky gamers, both casual and more experienced.

I love the idea of an LCG that comes ready-made to do drafting, but there's a huge looming problem with this game: The card pool is awful. Certain schools and certain spells are superior to others to a point of absurdity... the forced natured of being restricted to certian sources. It's difficult to make a deck with that isn't filled with junk cards... two decks from one set? Forget it.

Update: Originally I praised the game pretty highly, but a couple of things have come up.

A number of the prebuilt decks from the core set can make for some really uneven matchups. After teaching the game to several of my friends, more than one of them came away with a bad impression of the game because it was clear early on who would win just because of a bad matchup. Deckbuilding could help, but then I would need a second core set, and even then the small card pool of the core set means limited options (FFG's LCG core sets typically include many more unique cards).

I'm also not sure how the balance is going to hold up. FFG has done an incredible job keeping Netrunner balanced (that's the only LCG that I've played long-term, so I'm not sure about the others), I'm not sure how a smaller company will be able to do the same. Summoner Wars seems to still be mostly well-balanced, but it has a much slower release schedule.

Epic, Mage Wars Academy, Marvel 2PCG, and Ashes all came out around the same time and I was really expecting Ashes to be the one that would stand above the others. But now it's not looking so good.

Update 2: They've already made some erratta and it looks like the unbalanced match-ups are still an issue, so it looks like this game just has too many problems. Also, I've played a couple of games where the luck of the dice was a deciding factor. Despite having ways to mitigate them, one person literally rolled nothing but basic symbols (the weakest of all) in two rounds, and therefore had to spend a lot of time and resources just getting their dice to a usable state. Luck of the draw is an inherent issue in any card game, but adding the luck of the dice on top of that is just too much.

Sold.

RATING: 9
Just one play so far (Jessa vs Noah).  Way too early to rate it without looking at all the different Phoenixborns.  Early impressions though: mechanics are cool.  I dig the resource-management aspect of the dice.  There feels like a lot less "I can't do anything I want this turn" moments like MtG has when you're just not drawing mana, or drew too many high-cost cards to start.  Part of that has to do with the First Five feature in Ashes, which is an exceptionally clever element.  There isn't a ton of depth here, as most decks have only about 15 unique cards.  Drafts provide some interesting possibilities, but this is definitely a game that will require expansions for a player who avidly consumes it.

Pretty good tactical card game. The premade decks are largely balanced against one another. The dice as a resource is a bit luck prone and decks seem to rely on getting multiples of a set spell to be effective.

Picked this up at GenCon 2016.  Plaid Hat did a great job with this dueling game, which ships with 6 different Phoenix Born who wield varying decks and strategies.

This is a game that is mechanically simpler than magic, but thanks to the dice pool mechanic and what feels like very tight play testing, it is extremely interactive and interesting.  The varying life totals, slots for both spells and creatures, and even art help differentiate the sides and make it feel more "class-based" than MTG or some of its other contemporaries.

I'd strongly encourage card players to check this out; it is a tight game that encourages a lot of plays.

This is a well made and solid game. For my taste though you are whey to locked in with your chosen characters built in strategy. And your dice results lock you in even more. 
If you like streamlined games and are scared of other card games complexity, this might be for you. If you are a MTG fan, you might feel like a free bird locked in a cage.

Oct 2017:  Have still only played this game twice despite owning it nearly a year.  Rating dropped to 4 (from 5).  If we want to go head to head, we reach for MtG (duel decks are easy enough) or Twilight of the Gods.  Both seem easier to understand and at least a bit more balanced.  This is probably a game we will sell eventually.

Original:
First play through was very confusing and we messed up horribly.  Boyfriend watched a few videos online and the second play went smoother, rules wise.  Once it made sense it was a fun game - though I haven't played any other dueling sort of card game.

However, 2 player felt very unbalanced with the characters we chose - Coal vs. Aradel.  I think it would play much better with 3-4 players (despite the rating on BGG) because you'd have to choose who to attack rather than constantly blitzing your only opponent.  It might also be better if we play with other characters, but we haven't had time to try that yet.

The best game of the MTG-inspired dueling magicians crop. Here's why I love it more than the others:

- Ashes uses dice for resources (instead of mana, power crystals, etc.). This is awesome because it gives players access to the full range of resources right out the gate. There's no slow build-up and no chance of your hand being bogged down with resource cards. Every card in your hand is something useful and accessible right from the get go. 

- To temper the immediate power, and keep the game free of overpowered combos (often seen in MTG and Heartstone), each player is limited to ONE action (e.g. play a card, activate a card, attack, etc.) instead of an entire turn of actions. So turns are more of a back and forth, creating a really cool tension and allowing players to sufficiently react to one another.

- Ashes also creates some interesting strategy because your creatures/ongoing spells can only activate once in any given round. So if you use a creature early on, it will be vulnerable to attack later in the round... but often, you want to use those creatures to clear the board and deprive your opponent of resources. 

- You also don't have to worry about dice luck, because dice can be used in multiple ways; you can even spend several of one type of die to change it another face. 

- I also like that the decks come pre-built. The cards are custom tailored to that particular deck's play style. Every card is unique to it and has a distinct theme. The game allows the option of custom deck-building, but doesn't force it upon players. I personally don't enjoy deck-building, too much trial and error, so it's nice having everything all put together for me. 

- I also like that Ashes, while great as a two-player game, allows for more players and works pretty well with three and four. 

- Finally, the art is so gorgeous! Seriously some of the best art I've ever seen in a game. And instead of generic fantasy tropes, each deck has different and unique art style. It's also worth mentioning that the art doesn't objectify women.

While this is intended to be an entry into the LCG genre, it ends up feeling more like an army in a box type game. While the game certainly encourages deck building, I think for most people the game will work better if the decks are left as is, as each character has a pretty distinctive collection of cards, both in terms of powers and artwork.

The game play itself is solid. I think it is a little too structured myself, with smallish limits as to how many cards you can have in play and a bunch of rules about who can attack who and in turn, who is allowed to defend. It's not complicated, it just feels like a step backward from what most card games are doing these days in regards to loosening up turn structure and by extension, freedom to make plays.

I'll need to mess around with it some more. Maybe after I see more characters in action, those limitations will make more sense to me and become strategy anchors rather than handcuffs. As for the rest, the resource dice mechanism and the art work are both fantastic.

My rating on this may change with more plays, but I really like it thus far. There are a tremendous amount of clever refinements and mechanics on the "wizard fight" subgenre here, and the potential for expansions is through the roof.

EDIT: Bumped down a tad because said expansions are starting to lose me. Lots of slight variations on preexisting cards. It doesn't help that PHG's distribution is horrible.

Oh good, another two player semi-collectable card game. I didn't have enough of these. I enjoy this genre, I truly do, but I worry about the amount of time I have to play these games since I play two player games with my wife (who's not a huge fan of confrontation) or with my **Netrunner** buddies (who'd rather be playing **Netrunner**). Still, I had been hearing a lot of good things about **Ashes** and I'm a sucker for good production values, so I pre-ordered it and it showed up *before* Gen Con (kudos to Plaid Hat Games!).

I've only played two games so far, but what I've seen I really like. I've seen all six base decks played and I've personally played two of them: Saria Guideman and Coal Roarkwin. Both played so drastically different, that after playing Saria's deck pretty well, I fell flat on my face with Coal. That's a huge compliment in my book: that two decks in the same game play that differently in the core set is excellent design and good indication of what's to come: variety.

If there's anything that I don't like it's the graphic design. Now, I love the art, and the graphic design is clear, but every card is mostly white and after a while they all seem *so similar*. Coming from **Netrunner** where there are factions who have their own colors it felt so strange to see every card be the same color. Now, **Ashes** does not have factions, so I get it, but still some color would have been nice.

Still, I enjoyed my plays and I'm keeping the game for the time being.

The gameplay is very good:
on par with M:TG or other battle-based CCG's.
Because it is an LCG, not a CCG, it gets bonus points.

The Precon decks have a sort of round-robin
rock-paper-lizard-spock effect, which we haven't quite mastered.
The 4 expansion decks are slightly more powerful than the base-box six decks (or we haven't played weak vs strong with them yet).

I really, -really- like the dice-as-mana mechanic,
You know exactly your own 'power' during a turn,
and also your opponents likely strength/abilities.
That is -excellent-. 

One serious advantage over M:TG (tourney format):
The surprise is the combos, not the smack-down.
I like that a lot as well. The abilities are diverse enough, and the combos feel emergent (even the pre-con decks).

We liked it well enough to buy a second set off of eBay for cheap (the first set was a Zak decision, because he really felt drawn to the artwork... [ was that a bad emergent pun...? 
Unintentional, I assure you !! ).

In summary; the gameplay is solid enough to make it repayable, and it's preferable to many other CCG's/LCG's out there.
So: it really comes down to one factor: The Art. It's....
Well: it's not quite my taste. 

Zak loves the hyper-realistic art, I prefer something more stylistic.
I prefer the gameplay (alone)of Ashes over, say: Blue Moon,
but the far superior diversity of Art in Blue Moon means that I like playing That Game (Blue Moon) far more than Ashes.

That being said...?
Blue Moon doesn't have League Play starting soon,
or League Support being provided by Asmodee.
Ashes does. Because of That? Ashes gets a 7-8/10 from me.

(original Review)
One part M:TG one part Blue Moon, one part Theomachy
the Dice /mana mechanic is a nice change, but tokens instead of Tapping is kludgey.
I feel like the game has a rock-paper-scissors-lizard-spock among the decks,
where a given two will always have the same result,
 I admit I need a few more plays to confirm/deny this.

This is most definitely not my thing, 
but my Son loves it..... so I really need to figure out strategies.

New Generation of Magic that fixes a lot of the things that drove me out of the genre. Mana hose is a thing of the past with this dice based mana system that is flat out brilliant and awesome. Pre built theme decks helps the wallet and gets back to creatures and enchantments instead of finding broken combo lock or mill decks. But there is still plenty of combo work to be had in a game.  It switches between spending mana and recycling mana types of differing rarity. Always something you can do. Adding a meditative action to change a dice symbol gives you even more flexibility and adds a level of uncertainty for opponents anticipating your next move. Turn initiative is novel and takes some plays to use effectively and not be victimized. This game will introduce tons of expansion decks.

Surprisingly enjoyable. The collectable nature (never-ending expansions) is a big turn-off to me; I like board games because they are relatively self-contained and I really don't have the time nowadays to build decks.

That said, the artwork was great and the mechanics, while MTG-like, were fresh. The overall experience was enjoyable enough for me to play again whereas most LCGs I quickly dismiss.

A very nicely executed ECG.  Builds on many familiar CCG mechanics, but adds several unique twists that strongly emphasize strategy.  Also eliminates any sort of "mana fixing" or "mana-acceleration" mechanic by randomly generating a fresh batch of resources every game round via dice.  Additionally, the art is gorgeous.

Unfortunately, I have not found a way to really make this game "work" in a fun way beyond 1v1 duels, despite being listed as a game for up to 4 players.  I would still strongly recommend this as a 2 player game for anyone looking for a fresh CCG-like experience, especially if you're sick of building decks out of nothing but rare cards to keep up with a competitive meta.

A very fun dueling game. The artwork is really something to behold and the game play is very smooth once you get it down. 

I really love just how much the starting decks vary in play styles and appreciate the slower release rate than that of A:NR or Doomtown. 

Would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in competitive play!

A nicely streamlined and aesthetically pleasing head to head card game. I'm enjoying the to and fro of the game there are plenty of meaningful choices to make. The ability to choose your starting hand is a really nice touch and it prevents those blow out games that can happen in Magic where you get nothing and mulligan the game away.

Another head to head card duel game that has slowed down for us despite not really getting that many games in during the initial trial period.

Excellent game! Totally scratches the "I want to be a magician with an army" itch, but is simple enough to fully immerse a new player quickly. I've only played pre-constructed so far, so am waiting to see what impact drafting and deck building have on game play before raising the ranking, but I feel it can definitely move up on my list to one of my favorites.  

Update: after playing constructed and getting a taste of the new decks coming out I have to say I'm even more impressed. I'm really excited to see where this game goes.

In this game it's all up to the player. Luck is reduced to a minimum. You will always have resources, can always summon creatures, always have cards in your hand for options. For me; this fixes everything that is wrong with certain other popular card games.

Very good LCG. Being able to choose your starting hand and having access to all your economy (dice) up front goes a long towards reducing variance. The gameplay itself is an interesting exercise in efficiency and the art is great.

Two (minor) issues: 1. I don't care much for the dueling mages theme. 2. Web-exclusive identities do not belong in an LCG. That's a dealbreaker.

I love the concept and mechanics of the game, it would be easy to house-rule a 2v2 variant for group play.  The problem I have is how the base decks feel very imbalanced.

Another head to head knock-opponent's-life-to-zero-first constructed Magic knockoff.  But it's a good one.  Gorgeous art, rather silly identity names, slim decks (30 cards and you CHOOSE your starting hand).  The potentially-irritating dice have minimal impact as there are only 3 possible rolls and all are useful.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Really good. Beautiful art and card layout. I love that you can use summon spells to repeatedly summon the same monster rather than having to draw each monster before summoning. The dice work well for generating mana, the gameplay is tight, it's ok value for what you get in the box, components are very high quality and best of all, my girlfriend loves it!

On the downside, the starter decks don't always play well against each other in certain match ups. The pace of games can drag a little at times and become very attritional as creatures are easy to summon. This does make room for a lot of strategy however. There's certainly plenty of scope for skill and strategy, the decks don't play themselves.

If you're looking for a MTG type game which is less of a commitment but with equally engaging gameplay, this could be just what you're looking for.

It may be too early to tell, but two games in...
First impressions:
1. Art work is killer.
2. Base Gameplay seems one-dimensional and lacking in variety. My girlfriend agrees. She feels that the strategies (or should I say strategy) for the different suggested decks feels limiting. I think it feels more like a race to be the first to develop your one strategy. Rather than a back and forth duel of strategies. I bet that future expansions and/or deck customization will fix some of this, but not enough here in the base deck suggestions to keep my interest.
3. Feels like a less interesting Dice Masters.

My opinion may change after a few more plays. If it does, I will make appropriate adjustments here. But so far, a resounding "meh".

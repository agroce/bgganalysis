Worthy Carcassonne variant. I'm not sure about the temples, but I prefer the field scoring in this game to the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A Carcassonne variant with a variation on Monasteries, the Hunters and Gatherers variant for field scoring, and a pleasant little sub game of moving the Ark of the Covenant around the map.

Not bad, but the original Carc (with original city scoring) is the best Carc making this game a bit superfluous unless you are seeking something extremely simple or have an interest in the subject matter.

Great Stand alone Carcassonne Clone, this is better than vanilla Carcassonne but not as god as carcassonne with some expansions.

This is a re-themed Carcassonne, with the interesting addition of an ark that can be moved in lieu of placing a tile.  Offers some interesting decisions, and a welcome change to the base Carcassonne game.

Least favorite of the series for us.  The ark movement is... distracting -- it's important, but it seems to not fit with Carcassonne.  Other than that, nothing really new here, and it's not the most visually striking.  No problem with the theme, though moving the ark around feels... weird.  Shouldn't King David come smack me?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Jokingly, "Christian Carcassonne," although really other than a couple of over-wrought religious comments in the rules, it's just a different flavor of Carcassonne. 

Basically they reworked the Mayor into the Prophet and gave him new powers, made roads better scoring with Oasis pictures, simplified fields with the wolf/sheep mechanic, changed cloister (now temple) completion and scoring, and added in the Ark as a way to score points when you don't place followers. 

Unfortunately, the graphics leave a bit to be desired. It can be hard to count wolves/sheep and really easy to miss a scroll which gives the +2 in a city that a shield would. 

Still, it definitely gives a different flavor - it makes it hard to control the big field and the Ark is a way of scoring points when you otherwise would not. It was about as enjoyable as regular Carcassonne, maybe even slightly more strategically interesting... but somewhat frustrating because of the difficulty managing the scoring because of the difficulty of mentally processing the images. City scrolls are nearly invisible and it's easy to miscount oases or sheep/wolves. 

Rated lower than Carcassonne because lack of expansions likely hurts replayability factor.

RATING: 8
I like being able to move the Ark to score points if I don't have an available meeple to place.  Other than that, it's pretty standard Carc, which isn't necessarily a bad thing...

A pretty solid entry in the Carcassonne family. Although the rules for the Temples are a bit arcane, they make for interesting decisions; the Prophet can be mighty powerful, and requires good planning; and the Ark is a simple yet effective way to score a few points.

RATING: 7
Medium Strategy
Multiple points-scoring methods make for a good range of choice in playing the randomly drawn tiles. Point tallies get so high in two- and three-player games, however, that I'd almost rather use pencil/paper than the limited scoring track.

Es un buen juego, pero demasiado pequeño para jugar más de dos personas. No deja de ser un Carcassonne con extras, que no es cosa mala. Más para coleccionistas que para jugadores.  Para los Cristianos tiene ese aliciente extra que supone la temática del juego.

Very good implementation of Carcassonne! Definetely would recommend to people wanting to begin playing Carcassonne or similiar games, since these rules are much more 'novice friendly' and easygoing than regular Carcassonne/tile laying games

Acquired 3/14/07 (BGG trade)

Good game, enjoyable. I've only played Carcassone a few times but those who I played with who are Caracassone fans said this is a nice variant, especially the Ark.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Have only played the base game of Carcassonne, but I can say that I enjoy this version a lot more.  The addition of the oases, scrolls, sheep and wolves help to make the game meatier while still keeping the gameplay simple enough for newbies to understand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Religious carcassone variant. Pretty fun adds the option of the ark which can be moved for extra points. Also the farmers feed sheep not cities which allows for opponents to place wolves down to reduce the sheep score. It also has oasis markers along the roads which add points just like the shilds do to the cities. Now that I have several Carcassonne expansions this seems like a small subset of the Carcassonne game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
{1 play • 3 player} After only one play, this is, right now, my favorite of the Carcassonne's.  It's essentially a "best of" Carcassonne, and all the mechanics that they've cribbed from earlier versions are ones I really like... so it stands to reason that I really like this one.  Plus, I like the new "Ark", as well, though I agree with others - it's too bad it's kinda of cheap-looking (though you can supply your own Ark piece, like I'm probably gonna do if/when I get the game)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A nice alternative to Carcassonne.  The game revamps some of the scoring mechanisms.  Roads and cities are carried over from Carcassonne.  Cloisters are replaced by Temples and Farming is altered to a system similar to Hunters and Gatherers.  The temple mechanism is quite good and adds a good twist to scoring.  Farming is still very important.  The new scoring mechanism is the Ark.  This is interesting but tends to be a bit fiddly.  Overall, a very good and solid variant on the classic.  [GTI Code: TPSL]

Definitely the best of the lot (carcassone series).
Carcassonne is an excellent filler and is best played with two players, though it is mildly enjoyable with more.  The ark of the covenant scoring rules are somewhat simplified and add an interesting twist with the Ark component.  Of all the versions, I think this one is the one worth owning.

Runs essentially like Carcassone with two additions.  1) A large meeple (prophet) that doubles the score of its city when finished.  2) An Ark of the Covenant piece that can be used to get a few points on a turn when a meeple is not placed on the board.

Nice little additions to expand scoring possibilities although I usually try to build my wife's prophet city huge to the point of not being finishable (the prophet advantage is lost on in-complete cities).

Instead of using the included scoreboard, my wife and I have used a Chutes and Ladders board.  This changes the strategy a little bit since you may try to get just the right number of point to climb a ladder or give your opponent a couple points to send them down a slide.  It give a little more strategy to gaining points.

A solid entry in the [i][gameid=822][/i] family, even for those not looking for a religious theme.

The one rule I don't like is the temples, which just don't fit into the finish a feature, score a feature mechanic of the game. If I play this with non-gamers, I will likely score them like cloisters in [i]Carcassonne[/i] to make it simple.

I like this somewhat vanilla, but self-contained Carc version, despite the theme. The field mechanism from H+G, the original cities, the intuitive and better-than-original roads w/oases, and the somewhat weird temples makes a nice set of features. The Ark movement is cool too. Similar to the dragon from P+D, but, you know, good instead of eating you. I dont love the prophet mechanic, but it cant be all good.

It definitely had some unique twists to it, I realized I don't take as many risks when I don't know the spread of possible pieces that I need still left in the game. Fields can get really big, really fast, without many pieces. The moving of the Ark is an interesting way to get a few points while you can if you have no other moves.

One of the better Carcassonne games.  Still fails to thrill me since player success is heavily dependent on luck of the draw... c'mon, one tile per turn!?!

Wow this is a fun game! The tiles are thick and sturdy, and the artwork is fantastic. There is a good bit of strategy to be had, and whats more - its fun!

The only downsides are:
1. it involves counting/addition (not so good when you're tired)
2. at least in 2 player games, the game can be all but over fairly early on

Still, definitely one of my favorite games!

Excellent Carcassonne variant.  Different, easier farmer rules means people learn much, much easier.  The Ark means you feel less helpless when drawing worthless tiles.  The temples are much more interesting than monasteries.  The only problem is the prophet meeple (preeple), which can dominate the scoring and decide the game - probably ought to be less powerful.

I like Carcassonne. This variant seems to improve on the original, though I still slightly prefer the original with the Inns and Cathedrals expansion. This is a cleaner play, especially with its unique farmer scoring. The new mechanism allows for placing tiles where you get more points and your opponent gets less points. Additionally, the movement of the ark provides choices for most every turn even when ones followers are depleted.

No more religious than Carcassonne; just a major improvement! More simple farm scoring (just add sheep and subtract wolves); removes runaway cloister leaders (neat "contestible" temples) and scoring if not placing a meeple (instead may move the ark).

This is a nice Carcassonne variation, combining basic Carcassonne with the field scoring from Hunters & Gatherers and throwing the ark in for its own unique twist.  In my games, the ark has usually been dominated by one or two players; it doesn't seem to particular help or hinder a player from winning, but just provides an alternate scoring method.

An interesting mix of basic Carcassonne, Hunters&Gatherers, and shades of Traders and Builders. The tile distribution is particularly distant from basic Carcassone and not too far from Hunters&Gatherers, but has a few interesting variations. The ark movement mechanic is _interesting_ and acts as a surprisingly effective hand-out to those that just don't draw the tiles they need -- and as a VP fountain to those that are out of meeples if the other players don't prevent it.

The combination of stream-lined rules, bold artwork, and unique play makes this my favorite stand-alone game of the Carcassonne series.  While I enjoy the simple fast nature of this one, I do wish there were more expansions to add.  I have purchased a 2nd set with the hopes of adding a few Carc-inspired expansions.  My only other "gripe" is that this version seems to suffer the most from the mega-fields; more roads are needed.

Carcassonne is OK as a stand alone but this is better. Expansons make Carcassonne lose its snappy pace and bog down its simplicity. This game has some distinct improvements over Carcassonne.

Played only twice, although I have quite a bit of regular Carcassonne experience.

I'm not at all bothered by the biblical background. A lot of people don't like the color of the tiles; I think they're just fine.

I bought this because the more expansions there are for the original Carcassonne, the more I like to play just 'vanilla' Carc -- with 'Die Baumeister des Königs', I won't have to sort through the tiles to get that experience.

I got this as an alternative to the increasingly bloated Carcassonne.  Serves the purpose, even if the biblical scholar in me doesn't like the ark scoring rules.

OK variant. It seems to have much fewer tiles than standard Carcass (maybe it does?). The Ark makes a nice addition for when your tile isn't worth putting a meeple on and the Prophets add a little more risk evaluation. Nice.

RATING: 7
I think that the only innovation is the Ark, which I do not find particularly compelling. Everything else will seem reassuringly familiar to Carcassonne buffs, who should like this game every bit as much as other versions, not least because it uses Hunters & Gatherers-like field scoring (sheep - wolves X 2), which I prefer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Many things improved over basic game.  The sheep make fields much easier to explain to new players.  Temples more interesting than cloisters.  But the ark doesn't do a whole lot, even when we remember it and not sure if I like the prophets.

RATING: 5
Place tiles then pawns on the board in good old Carcassonne fashion, and try to maximise points.  Slightly different - monasteries are now temples and only the five orthongal tiles matter (most pawns on the five tiles earns seven points), farmers are now shepherds (like the hunters in the Hunters and Gatherers game), big pawn scores double for a city once during the game (very powerful), and now there is an ark pawn that you can move in lieu of a pawn placement to score points for pawns passed.  Okay, because the base game was so strong, but not needed if you own any other of the Carcassonne games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Different enough from Carcassonne (and Hunters & Gatherers) to be worth owning.  In particular I like the way you can score points without removing followers from the board, with the Ark and with temples.  I was wary of the religious theme, but it's pretty much nonexistant (except for an odd sentence in the rules about people in the cities becoming wicked).

A nice variant with the shepherds reminding one of the field scoring in Hunters & Gatherers, and an added twist being able to move the ark 1-5 spaces for scoring possibilities -- especially useful if you've placed all you meeples.

Good Christian version of Carcassonne.  Doesn't add enough theme to be rated higher though.  Most of the time, I will just grab the original over this version.

RATING: 8
In terms of the Carcassonne games this one slightly edges out Hunters and Gathererers as the best of what I've played so far from this line.  

What makes it work the best is that it shares the more intuitive and refined field rules as with Hunters and Gatherers, where you count up the number of animals to score you points, rather than sorting out what cities are supplied as in the normal Carcassone.

The use of a prophet piece is a nice way to have each player "up the ante" and make others have to pay attention to each others game more closely, otherwise someone could yield a huge payout of points for their prophet piece.

Lastly, moving the Ark around gives a nice blanket option to do something when a particular tile comes up that isn't that interesting to the player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
So far my favorite of the Carcasonne games despite the theme (do not be put off by the quasi-religious theme). I like most of the innovations (like the fields and the Ark) but the prophet thing is very overpowered. Someone once referred to this as "Carcassonne's greatest hits" and I think that's a good assessment.

See my review for more details.

I play this with the kids occasionally.  We don't like the Ark so we don't play with it.  I think they reason the kids don't like it is because they always forget to use it and it was usually the difference in the game.  I'll have to try to get them to use it more.

But, really, this is Carc and I'm not a huge Carc fan.  It's fun but it's more mindless fun than thinking fun.

[2 plays] Carcassonne with a little religion mixed in... last thing it needed.  Though the whole religious theme is not difficult to disregard, especially if you are already the theme-disregarding sort of gamer.

My favourite of all the Carcassonne variants.  Nice, clear artwork so you can see easily what's going on.  Nice colour scheme.  Self-contained - no need for costly expansions.  

I prefer this as a 2 player game (where it tends to take experts less than 25 mins per game with < 60 seconds of setup) yet it also works well as a gateway game for up to 5, particularly as the move-ark-to-score mechanism allows for significant scoring even when a player has accidentally exhausted their meeples.

Kindly brought back from the US for me by Paul Allwood of this parish, for USD26!!! It must contain a golden Ark for sure...
*** Played it today, it has a lot of nice twists. The sheep/wolves, the oasis, the Prophet and the Ark all add to the mix. The Temples were pointless in my view, and the graphics were a little harsh. Much too yellow and brown, not as colourful as I would have liked. The change to sheep instead of cities made a big difference, and I'd definitely want to play this version again.

* Played 20+ times. Very similar to original Carcassonne. Roads score like they do in Inns & Cathedrals, Cities score same, fields score like Hunters & Gatherers. Different tile distribution that makes the game work better with more conatined fields. Nice tweak with temples, and very nice theme application. ((Copy from U; traded to friend for Big City.))

(Title edited so it would be grouped with the rest of the series, which this game is clearly a part of.)

At least as good as Hunters & Gatherers, and our group has actually found it to be the nastiest standalone Carcassonne variant.  The temples take some getting used to, but they definitely encourage clever, aggressive play.  The prophet is a major gamble, between knowing when to play it and the possibility of your opponents closing off the city he's in.  And the ark is a nice addition that you have to move very carefully.

If you're not a Christian, don't be put off by the theme.  It's as thin and barely there as with any other version of the game.  You don't really feel like you're building the French countryside in original Carc, and this is the same way.  Besides, an informal survey of our group determined that people were just as likely to think of Indiana Jones as they were the Bible when playing this game.

Targeted to be played soon as part of our ongoing "Oldies But Goodies" project. Last played: 9-8-07

Players lay out tiles, which are supposed to represent Biblical Israel. They gain points for the roads, cities, fields they build, as well as gaining points when the Ark passes over them and for being near one of the temples.  What?  There was only one Temple in Israel?  Okay, so the theme and the gameplay don't line up so well.  It's still fun.

It's Carcassonne with some extra rules (effectively, a couple expansions included in the box).

We have played this game a handful of times and my son, who does not like games outside of electronics, won't (shockingly) complain strongly when we have a game night and this is on the table. For him that is practically and endorsement.  Took two longish games (90 min) to teach the kids and now they are thinking an plotting on thier own.  I haven't played the parent game carcasonne, and probably won't since this is regarded as a superior product for game tactics and scoring.

Ark of the Covenant is probably the best standalone (i.e. unexpanded) game in the Carcassonne family.  I usually play Carcassonne with the first two expansions.  In that context, Ark of the Covenant offers a return to the short playing time and simple rules of the original Carcassonne - but with smoother edges, better balance, and more tactical considerations.  It's less cutthroat than vanilla Carcassonne because of (1) the more varied tile mix, (2) the extra meeple in each player's supply, and (3) the ability to score with the ark even after exhausting your meeples.  The friendlier play combined with the short play time and simpler scoring rules makes Ark of the Covenant a great choice for welcoming new players to the Carcassonne series.

Wow.  I don't like normal Carcassonne much but this game really changed my outlook.  The Ark adds a whole new dimension to this game.  The threat of the Ark points can be used to deter opponents from placing followers.  What a great idea!  I had an excellent two player game of this and actually didn't find Carcassonne dry.

For me, the more expansions you add to Carcassonne, the more fiddly and tedious the game often becomes.

Like this better than regular Carcassonne.  Field scoring is easier.  Temples are easier to complete, yet competitive. Oasi make roads a more viable strategy.  Prophets make cities more valuable. The Ark itself leaves another scoring option on turns you wouldn't normally be able to score.  All these little differences make this a fuller, yet easier to get into game for new players.  Like this as well as Hunters and Gatherers and better than the already fun base game of Carc.

RATING: 6
Not enough novelty to justify this game. Only improved mechanic over original "Carcassonne" is the temple, which can be disputed by all players. It copies the "farmer" scoring from "Hunters & Gatherers". The prophet is too powerful and the game is too often decided by how successfully he is played. The ark is a nice addition as a scoring option, but nothing special. I felt the components were a little inferior. Sadly, the ark is a mere cardboard piece, which does not go well along the wooden little guys (update: that has been corrected in a later printing run by the addition of a wooden ark). Besides, there are 71 tiles (plus the starting tile), which means that no matter how many players there are, they will always have different numbers of turns.

This one is a fresh Carc.  I don't know why, it just is.  I've been thinking of getting an new set of Carc just to play as a base set.  But, one night I pulled this out and played it.

Compared to carcassonne (basic game or basic + inns and cathedrals)

Note, I do not particulary enjoy the biblical theme or visual style.

Plusses (+)
* Sheep make end-game more fun than carcassonne and less complex.  
* The temples are less of an instant-bonus to the player that drew it than the cloisters were.

Negatives (-)
* each turn seems to take longer because there are more strategies going on at once.  I fell like i'm counting alot... "3 points for moving the ark, versus, 4 points for this quick city, versus 2 points for a short road but it adds a sheep that i need..."
* the Prophet on a huge city can really make the game impossible to catch up.  I completed a city in our last game worth 84 points. Same problem existed in Carcassone with the Cathedral, though this is even worse. (Cathedral is 3 points per city tile versus Prophet's 4 points.)

Hard to give it a "9" since the novelty is worn off, but still a superbly solid game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Up front, I have mixed feelings about base Carcassone, which has some nice mechanics and strategies, but doesn't always play nicely, or reward clever play.

Ark of the Covenant is a biblical re-theming of Carc by 
Klaus-Jürgen Wrede which adds some nice balancing mechanics, as well as additional tactical options.

Each player has a BIG MEEPLE (the Prophet) which scores 2X but counts as any other meeple for control, requiring clever placement.

Instead of Fields, meeples are put out to pasture as Shepherds, counting 2pts for each sheep, but subtracting a sheep for every wolf in the fold.  So instead of trying to steal fields one can simply penalize them with otherwise unneeded tiles.

Temples score like Monasteries, but are completed by only 4 roads, instead of 8 tiles- this also means you may want to use road tiles for temple completion instead of other things.

Finally, the Ark moves about the roadways, and if nothing else seems appealing having meeples passed on the roads collects points as well, though this seems a more minor strategy in play than in concept.

I definitely liked this version better than straight Carc, or Carc The Disovery.  Additedly the biblical theme appeals to me, but the added bits help to make vanilla Carc less bland.

I seem to keep looking for the magic Meeple that will make Carcassone a better game for me... I may have found it here.

Starting this at a cautious 6.5.

Even as a Christian myself, I find most Christian arts to be cringe-makingly embarrassing and this re-skinned version of Carcassonne does little to improve my opinion. There seems to be a smaller number of tiles this time, but perhaps I've just bought too many mini expansions for my standard set. Why is the Ark just a cardboard chit when surely an attractive miniature was called for? "Prophets calling on cities to repent" as theming for a double meeple? Nothing here adds anything to the standard game and I'd hesitate to recommend this even to a church audience.

Ark of the Covenant is probably one of the better large group Carcassonnes.  I think Carcassonne usually falls flat with too many, but the Ark moving mechanic provides a means to score without always having to get a beneficial tile draw time after time.  Don't be scared off by the bible theme either as its hardly present beyond the subject matter itself.  Scoring wise, the game keeps to its roots with a few new, novel modifications (cloisters are different).  Production quality is also very solid.

Only 1 play in, and I think it's among my favorite Carcassonne's yet.  It does many things right:

1. It keeps the theme of building a countryside.  It's great to watch the cities and roads form as you lay the tiles.

2. The field scoring is very straightforward to explain to people.  It also still works well.

3. Moving the ark around gives a whole new dimension to the game.  And, IMHO, a good dimension.

There are a few turn offs:

1. We've agreed to make the temples work just like cloisters from the original.  The way the temples work in the rules is too much of a paradigm shift from the other features.

2. The religious theme is a little distracting.

Plays exactly like regular Carcassonne with a bit of a theme twist, you can move the ark to gather additional points.  If you like Carcassone and feel like you have to have all in the family then you need this one.  Otherwise if you have Carcassone with the expansions, don't bother with this one.  Basically all you need is to create and Ark, get a token that represents the Ark move the Ark up to 5 spaces (no back tracking).  Moving the Ark takes the place of placing a Meeple after you have placed your tile.  Who ever has a Meeple in a space that the Ark passes through gets a point.  Now you have added the Ark of the Covenant Expansion to you Carcassonne game.

RATING: 7.5
This is a fun variant on Carcassonne. Overall it is similar with tile laying and castle and road building. There are a few differences. There is a prophet meeple that can be used in a city once during the game to score double points. There is an Ark of the Covenant that can be moved past meeples to score points. Fields owned are scored at the end of the game by the number of sheep after subtracting wolves. Overall I thought this was a little more fun than the basic Carccassonne.

Very strong Carcassonne offering and in my opinion has stronger gameplay than the original. Oases that you can also find as Inns in Inns & Cathedrals and the sheep and the wolves balance the scoring of roads and fields. Prophet is a neat lottery ticket and the area majority of temples is a lot more interesting than the classic monasteries. The actual ark is also a very interesting concept that balances bad tile draws and together with scoring challenge of the temples makes the dynamic of getting your followers on board and keeping them there very interesting.

Pretty much the same as the basic Carcassonne, but with the Ark-twist.

RATING: 6.5
I'm a pretty big fan of Carcassonne and all the expansions, so I was expecting The Ark of the Covenant be a "been here, done that" kind of experience. It turns out I was wrong. I really liked the oasis scoring, but I'm not so sure about the temple scoring. Overall I'm very impressed, but I think I'll probably choose expanded Carc over this one.

Update: Traded away in an attempt to downsize my collection. I have nearly every Carc expansion so this just seemed a bit unnecessary.

RATING: 9
We play this one a lot.  I felt it needed a little more of a Bible feel, so I made up cards, each card with a name of 1 of the 12 tribes of Isrial.  We draw from these cards to see who will go first (alphabetically).  My daughter is learning the names of the 12 tribes this way.  It is also fun through the game to know that you are a Levite, Benjaminite, (etc.).

Not as good a stand-alone game as Hunters & Gatherers, but it has a nice twists in how the Ark contributes to the scoring and strategy. Can't get my head around why the temples are scored the way they are, though. The tile distribution is somewhat lackluster as well, but that can be said about the basic Carcassonne too.

Acquired in 2006. Played 12 games so far. Good gateway game because of the simpler scoring than the original Carcassonne. I like the sheep and the overall graphics of the game (although I still prefer the graphics of the original Carcassonne the best). The prophet and temples are weaker aspects of the game compared to its numerous cousins. Gave away to folks who might enjoy it more.

[b]My thoughts[/b]: Nice twist on old strategies and requires a lot of focus to play efficiently.  Works really well with 2 people, as well as more.  Still too much open road, but better than the original in that regard. This one has some really unique strategies with the ark, the temples, oasis added from Inns and Cathedrals. Plus the double score guy (prophet) that you can only use once.
Needs some expansions to make this one really fun, idk, and the ark thing doesn't really do it for me. Maybe they based the game on that idea or added it to just keep people from getting bored when they couldn't do anything.

While it's Carcassone at it's core, it's missing specific tile configurations that make threatening other player's cities more probable. Pasted on theme and not as great gameplay - go with the original.

I can't say that I would recommend this over Carcassonne. In my opinion it's not different enough from what already existed (Vanilla and Hunters & Gatherers) to have even been published. That said, it's still Carcassonne and still a lot of tile laying fun will come from this package. I don't really care that the [i]farmer[/i] scoring is simpler; I rather like the farmer scoring in Vanilla Carc. The Ark movement is interesting, but too fiddly for me to bother. However, I do prefer temples over cloisters for the fact that you can actually compete for them. [b]6[/b]

Good game that plays fairly quickly and is easy to learn.  Have found it to work well as one of the games that introduces Euro games.  Many plays later, I still enjoy the game, but if not played cut-throat loses much of the appeal.  As well, as is typical of most carc type games, best with 2-3 players at most.  This is a great stand alone game in the series - but I prefer Carc's expandability and decided I don't need both.  Sold in the charity auction.

Sort of a combination of Carc with H&G (with a bit of a feel of Mesopotamia for me). The Ark works like the Dragon (Princess & Dragon expansion), but helps you instead of hurts others, and is a clever way to use your non-meeple placing turns. The Ark generally rewards the player with the most meeples on the board, and used wisely will nudge the scores towards your victory and their defeat. The large one-use Prophet meeple is clever as well. ('Ark of the Covenant, The' - my ass!)

i wish i could combine elements of this and carcassonne.  i like the oasis better than inns (which are double or nothing).  i like the sheep better than the standard farmer mechanic.  but the ark mechanic feels a little tacked on, and the temple especially just scores in a way that doesnt feel totally natural.

RATING: 6
Played a four player game, once, and a three player game five times. It was OK, but I prefer regular Carcassonne. When I said it was OK, part of what made it so was who I played it with. We did a lot of thematic jokes during the game. There's no way I'd play this game with a bunch of bible thumpers that can't take a joke. And because you often don't know who is and who isn't until an argument starts, I'd purposefully avoided this game until now. I didn't need to tread the religious zealot minefield any sooner than necessary. -------- Other comments - I'm not a fan of the bright yellow tiles. The soothing green of regular Carcassonne is much easier on the eyes. The Ark itself was... sort of silly. I'm not sure what its aimless meanderings around the board were supposed to represent. Nor do I understand why ancient Jews would be making temple "crosses".

I have always described this game as puzzle-like to new players.  In this game, the pieces are used to create the puzzle as you go rather than fit them into the right place in a standard puzzle.  The conflicts are not direct, but not very subtle either.  There is enough conflict to turn off those who don't want any conflict.  At the same time, there is not very much conflict in the game for those who enjoy it.  The conflict is only occasional, the rest of the time is spent gaining points for yourself.  Only one person that I have introduced it to has not liked it.

Seems like a very solid version of Carcassonne. The Ark is a nice rule, the farmer rule is good and prophets are nice.

I like the new rules, though they can be a little unbalanced towards a player (i.e. in a 3-player game, if two players are building in one area and a third is off by himself, the moving of the Ark is going to account for lots of points for the two together and little to nothing for the isolated player - this can add up pretty fast in this game!). I also think the game suffers from having a lot less tiles than Hunters & Gatherers (though we all assumed this was to make the game play faster and be more family-friendly). With H&G, The Castle, and the original to play, I don't know if Ark will get much playing time. but it's a nice variation and addition to the Carcassonne family.

This game is a variant of Carcassonne.  It has a different theme, but play is quite similar.  Although  it's not meant to be co-operative, the scoring system makes working together on a project that both parties will get full points for a definite possibility, and sometimes a very appealing option.  

As for the theme, it is biblical, but not heavily so.  Nevertheless, my friends and I found it easy to give it a sort of Indiana Jones RPG feel, by calling the large meeples archeologists and the small meeples research assistants.  Completing a road, city or temple was completing an excavation of the same.

The tiles are substantial and feature nice artwork.  I got my game at a thrift shop and it was missing its ark, but from photos I've seen on the Geek, that's no great loss.  I had fun constructing one for myself that serves very well.  (4+4)

I really like this edition's graphic style. The moving of the Ark (the whole point of the theme), is actually not really much fun, and I don't think it adds much to the game. It has a neat mechanic of counting sheep, which it probably borrowed from Hunters and Gatherers, which I believe is the best expansion in the Carc series.

RATING: 3
Another Carcassonne variant, only this time for believers... Some things are ridiculous and some things are just hilarious. Too bad that this baby belongs to the former group. 

The ark itself is ugly, too big, too stupid and too unuseful. Of course you can get some essential minor points with it but it's worthless imho. It feels quite a mandatory add-on to make this expansion have its distant religious touch.

I don't think I'll ever play this again when there's basic Carcassonne and many better variant games. I'd choose Hunters&Gatherers over this anytime. And basic Carcassonne is way more prettier too.

The scoring in this game is a little simpler than in Carcassonne and the Ark allows another way of gaining VPs. Whether or not you belong to a faith tradition that embraces the story of the Israelites, this game would be enjoyable since the theme is pretty thinly applied. It would still be in my collection but I gave it to my Dad.

Good game. The rating is boosted by the irresistible sheep (or 'Dollies', in my gaming group :) ). I just wonder why there is a player that has to use _yellow_ meeples in all that desert...

I think this is actually an improvement over vanilla Carcassonne.  In particular, the "farmer" rules are much easier to wrap your head around.  And although it's not a huge factor, it's nice to have the Ark around as an extra way to score some points.

On the whole it's very similar to some of the other Carcassonne titles, so I wouldn't recommend this if you already own any of the others.  But if you don't have any, and you're trying to decide which one to get, this would not be a bad choice.

Another minor (essentially scoring) variation on the Carcassonne format. I like it slightly less than the previous games but it is still an excellent one.

Fun spinoff of Carcossonne. Nice not to have to deal with dice. Wife hates this game because everyone 'viruses' onto her sheep fields and buildings. Probably more of a guys game because you can really screw people up by placing tiles in places where they can't finish their buildings. My experience has been that some women (see example above) can take this type of play a little personal. Overall, lots of fun and is different every time. We ended up buying 2 versions and putting them together for longer games.

This game had sat untouched on my shelf for almost 7 years before I introduced it to my girlfriend in 2014. I'd almost forgotten how enjoyable this was and what a great gateway game it is for light gamers. I sold off my copy of Carcassonne precisely because this game fits the 'gateway game' bill better. The temples still annoy me whenever they come out, but apart from that, I'm very happy to introduce and play Ark with new gamers.

RATING: 7
Takes the best of Carcassonne (etc.) and Carcassonne: Hunters & Gatherers and assembles them into a solid package. In addition, the inclusion of the Ark gives players that draw a useless tile something to do. Probably the most accessible of the Carcassonne titles.

RATING: 6
Nice mix of Carc with the hunters of H&G. There are a few problems though. The prophet gives enormous benefit to those who complete cities - if you don't score around 30 points with your prophet, you lose bigtime. There's too many followers (meeples), making the ark sorta useless as an option - it should be worth 2 points a follower. In the end, for the limited number of tiles available, there's too many scoring options and the games I've played have never been close.

A new game based on Carcassonne, Ark of the Covenant has players vie for control of cities, roads, flocks, and temples by using the tiles to create the dynamic play area and by placing followers on the tiles.

New features compared to Carcassonne include oases along roads which award 1 additional point to that road for each oasis, a one-time use "prophet" for each player which doubles the value of a completed city for that player, a simplified field scoring with each sheep in the field adding 2 points and each wolf subtracting 2 points, and a new scoring mechanism for temples. Additionally, players can forgo the placement of a follower on the board to move the Ark around the tiles and award 1 point to the owner of each follower it passes.

More options and a good Bible themed game too boot!  Highly Recommended!

RATING: 8
I like this game a great deal - you can pretty much think of it as a standalone Carcassonne game like Hunters & Gatherers. There are enough unique new rules to make the game play quite different while still feeling very much like Carcassonne. Except for the Ark itself, you can completely remove the religious context from table discussion by calling the small meeples followers and the big meeple the leader - this is a bonus for me. I'm pretty sure I will be playing this a lot in the months to come.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good addition to the Carcassonne line, with interesting new mechanics. The tile assortment, however, isn't as varied as it should be, in my opinion (I'm tempted to use these rules with the H&G set with the bonus tiles, in fact, treating the lakes as simple breaks in the roads).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The best of the Carcassonne versions that I've tried so far (i.e. this, Carcassonne w/ most combinations of expansions and Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers).  It avoids the messy farmer scoring that puts off most of my family (putting cute sheep in the fields instead) and the big meeple, ark and temples are good twists.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As a Carcassone variant this game has some great features. The scoring of fields based on the number of sheep present, along with the potential for wolves to eat the sheep is a great touch that works great with the theme. The movement of the Ark for scoring (and strategic placement thereof) is another nice touch that fits well with the theme. I have seem comments by some that don't like religious themed games, but that's too bad for them... this is simply a great variant on a very fun base game.

RATING: 8
Best of the variants in my opinion.  The Ark movement really helps the game, and I feel the original Carcassonne has had too many expansions to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A nice variant on the traditional Carcassonne formula. Borrows the "farm" scoring fromm hunters and gatherers, and the temples seem much more strategic and interesting than  regular Carcassonne cloisters (avoids game-long commitment of meeples). It uses a lot of the good bits from Carcassonne expansions and spin-offs without adding extra length. Just as good as base Carc + Inns and Cathedrals, or base Carc + Traders and Builders.

I own 2 versions of this game: the one with the wooden Ark, and the one with the cardboard Ark. The wooden Ark is fun, but due to its size, it's a bit unruly to move around the tiles. The cardboard Ark is more functional, but looses some thematic points and doesn't look as cool. It's unfortunate that such a good Carcassonne variant would languor in out of print status. It's worlds better than the garbage expansions they've been pushing lately.

This is a fun variation of Carcossone.  I especially like how the wolves eat the sheep.  I get a big kick out of laying tiles that put wolves in with the sheep.  Moving the ark back and forth is kind of lame, however, because it seems like the ark does nothing but move back and forth in the same four spots over and over again - pointless scoring IMHO.  

This game is fun, but I don't think this is the best variation of Carcossone, but since I haven't tried them all, I'll save my judgment for which one is best for later.

[BGCOLOR=#FFFF00][COLOR=#000000]Family.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Tile-laying. I think I like this better than original Carc: the field (farm) scoring is simpler and the Ark adds an extra option to play, especially in the sometimes frequent situation that a player doesn't have a meeple placement.

RATING: 7.5
A light, yet strategical tile-laying game.  Great for a filler, or can be played several times in a row for a fun evening.  Very similar to the core "Carcasonne" game (and some expansions, I'm sure, but I don't know them well enough to say for sure).  The religious theme makes it interesting, but at the same time isn't so "deep" that non-religious players won't enjoy it.  There's enough "interaction" to keep it from feeling like solitaire, but it's also non-confrontational enough that some non-gamers may enjoy it too.  My wife enjoys playing this with me, which is a big plus :)

The new features make the game more interesting. Instead of placing the road and field, you have more surprise with the number of oasis and sheep in the tile. The ark will give you option to score when you have no follwers on hand. Looking forward for its expansion if any.

A very enjoyable variation on the Carcassonne theme set in the Holy Land (rather than France), and with a Biblical theme.  It uses a few rules from other Carc variants (including the use of animals on the fields, like Hunters & Gatherers, and a large follower meeple (like Inns & Cathedrals) called a Prophet.  And it adds a few unique rules, such as an Ark of the Covenant piece that can be moved around the area for additional points.  Both my wife and I like this version very much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
With the wooden Ark piece.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a variant of Carcassonne. The theme is only mildly drawn out in the game, but in two important ways that also happen to be my favorite elements in the game - the prophets and the Ark of the Covenant.  The prophets can be placed in a city (once per game per player) for double points on completing that city, and this can be a real game changer. The Ark can be moved (up to 5 tiles) instead of placing a worker or prophet, and it 'blesses' any meeples in its path (score 1 point). Some game tiles also have a scroll and oasis for bonus points.

Because of the Ark and the prophets, I like this game as an alternative to the base Carcassonne.  The Ark token that comes with the game is small and unimpressive, so I made my own. And I added religious decorations to the prophets to help distinguish them better from the normal meeples (even though they are mega-meeple size, it can be hard to tell when they are on the tile area).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The theme does nothing for me personally, but it was implemented pretty well. The crappy little ark could use some improvement, of course! This could be my favorite of the Carcassonne variants - nice mix of the better elements from the other versions. The variant cloister scoring is an especially nice and thematic rule change. 

But it is still Carcassonne, and I'm a bit tired of the series as a whole.

After my wife and I unintentionally killed Carc - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/27391/guilty-of-meepleslaughter-how-we-accidentally-ki - we attempted to resuscitate it with "Carcassonne: The City".  I enjoyed it, but it didn't rekindle the Carc spark for my wife.  However, this edition has proven to be a hit, and I find it to be the best iteration of Carc yet.  It adds a couple of elements borrowed from some of the original expansions, it adds the interesting element of surrounding the temples, it adds the important feature of the Ark to balance unlucky tile draws, and it does all of this in a simple, quick-playing package.  However, it has finally occurred to me after all these years that Carc is simply lacking in meaningful decisions since most tiles have very few optimal positions in which to lay them.  And if players use a 2- or 3-tile hand variant, the analysis paralysis could kick in, leading once again to excessively long games.  But overall, I'm quite happy to own this version of the game.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

[2 plays] Initial reaction rating.  I didn't like it as much as regular carcassonne.  It seems like the prophet making the city double points can make a HUGE point swing, if a person is lucky enough to get that in a big city they can almost lock the game in one move.  Maybe I am just more used to regular carcassonne and that is why I don't like this one as much, not sure.  I will need to play it a few more times to be sure.

Variant to Carcassone with light Bible/ Desert theme and a few new ways to score. If you only get one Carcassone edition , this is probably the one to get since it plays almost identical to the original, with the slight changes making it a bit easier to play.  The Christian theme is not heavy handed, so its nice for Christian groups/ Sunday play without being annoying for non-religious players or fans of Indiana Jones.  Although the desert yellow isnt as rich as the lush green of the original, the art is appealing.

Neat version of Carcassone.  I'm not exceptionally taken with Carc or Ark, but it's very nicely made and not unpleasant and pretty easy to teach.

A very nice game in the Carcassonne line. If the religious theme doesn't bother you, it can be very enjoyable. The Ark movement is a nice touch.

A good rendition of Carcasssonne, combines best elemements of the game and some of the expansions into one tight package.  Uses much easier and IMO better farmer scoring from Hunters & Gatherers.

At first glance, this seems like a pretty straightforward copy of Carcassonne. However, just about every kind of scoring has been changed subtly - but enough that it markedly changes the dynamics, especially with monasteries and fields. Only cities are the same (and even they have a special kind of follower that can only be placed there). Basically, this has been fiddled with just enough to make it interesting, but not too much to ruin it. So far, of all Carcassonne clones, this comes closest to the goodness of the original.

I absolutely love this game. There are so many different possibilities that it's just crazy. The best part is that it's easy to explain and to play. And *everyone* wants to play it again. It has as much depth as you want, while being as light as you want at the same time.

Hát az a helyzet, hogy a vége fele már inkább játszottam vele úgy mint a sima Carcassone-val. A farkasos bárányos alap 5let nem rossz, de kevés kártya volt hozzá. A kolostor újra értelmezése már annyira nem jött be.

RATING: 7
Quite fun, but too many games come down to whoever draws one certain tile first.  Always a downer to realize you won or lost a game due to one draw.  Kind of like playing magic in constant topdeck mode.  Even playing with a hand of three tiles didn't add too much to the game.  

Also new players hate the ark because it is too easy to forget to move it to those few extra points. 

The prophet (doubles the value of the city it is in) seems swingy too.

One reason I prefer this version over carcassonne is the lack of "end around" tiles...the ones where a road terminates and there is a clear field on three sides.  They seem to just make super fields in Carcassonne...I prefer this version where people can fight over many fields instead of the one big one that inevitably arises.  Though the nice interaction between completing cities and making your fields worth more is gone...still the sheep/wolves (or tigers/animals in Hunters Gatherers) is an easy mechanic for new players...and new players are the ones I'll be playing this game with.

Bottom line, it is still fun despite all those negatives, (though it might just be because I love maps).

Preferred over regular Carcassonne. The Ark gives good reason to not place guys just for the heck of it, adds value to farmers, and other stuff. The temples are a big improvement over cloisters, and the prophet is a cool somewhat risky element. I still prefer The City, but this is neat.

I thought this would get my family into Carcassonne, but they didn't seem to go for it. I have a work colleague who loves Carcassonne and all the expansions, so we'll most likely stick with that. I like Ark for the clarity of the tiles, but ended up giving it away to a family I think will appreciate it more.

My first version of Carcassonne, a fantastic system.  I particularly like the Judaeo-Christian theme as well.  One of the best games that my wife and I can play together 2 player.

A good variation on Carcassonne.  I like the ark presesence, gives you a chance to get points with the meeples in the field before they score at the end.  I still prefer regular carcassonne, but might borrow the big meeple(the town, road or field scores double, but then you big meeple is out) rule from this for regular carcassone.  Probably wont double dip on this one, I own regular carcassonne.  Also, not terribly preachy.  Which makes the religion theme tollirable.

Obtaining this one was completely random. Was walking past the christian bookstore and this caught my eye on a clearance shelf out front. I saw that it was pretty much the same as Carcassonne (a game a I really like) so we picked it up. Played for the first time last night and it was really fun.

Have only played with 2 players and it has been pretty entertaining.  I think it would be better with 3 or 4 players.  The game is fairly long and repetitive with 2 but it remains fun for the majority of the game.  Once one player gains a large lead, which happens quite often, it starts to drag a bit.  I think this would be much less likely in a game with more players.

This is another solid Carcassonne variant. Like Hunters and Gatherers, Ark of the Covenant has quite a few of the ideas from the Carcassonne expansions built right into it. There are more ways to earn points, the fields are simple to score and the way temples are completed adds a nice twist to tile placement.

I don't like it quite as much as Hunters and Gatherers, because it can be too easy to abuse the scoring of the ark. I'm also not thrilled with the prophet meeples either, since they have a tendency to create some rather large point swings. I think I prefer the giant meeple rules found in Inns and Cathederals, but none of these are absolute deal breakers. It's still a solid standalone Carcassonne set.

Decent variation on original. I like the idea of the Ark, but are you ever really going to use it? This issue is created by having one or two too many meeples available. Reduce the number, and suddenly your choices are much more interesting. Perhaps the idea was for the game to be gentler, and not force hard decisions early on....

More of the same.  Nothing new to see here.  While I agree with some that this one is more "streamlined" than regular Carcassonne, I think I prefer either regular Carcassonne for a more strategic game, and Hunters and Gatherers for a more simple game.

A nice varient of Carcassonne. The Ark gives players somethign they can do if they run out of meeples, a nice addition for new players. Field scoring is much simpler than carcassone, unfortunately the temples that replace cloisters are boith themewas and game mechanically awkward.

I've only played it once, so I hesitate to rate it yet -- but I decided to give it an 8 anyway.  I'll revisit this after more plays and decide if it needs to be moved up or down the scale.

I really enjoy this.  It's my first Carcassone game, and I've read a lot about them, and anticipated playing this.  I'm glad that I wasn't disappointed.  I've read that this has the best of the other Carcassones, and tossed some rules that weren't popular with the others, so I'm glad that I chose this one to begin with.

Edit:  I've played it more now, and my initial opinions still hold.

This variant Carcassonne, has players vie for control of cities, roads, flocks, and temples by using the tiles to create the dynamic play area and by placing followers on the tiles.
Scoring fields is simpler than the original game, but there are lots of addition scoring opportunities.

[b]VERY GOOD LIGHTWEIGHT.[/b]

This is possibly the best of the Carcassone style of tile-laying games, with simple rules and more depth to the strategy than at first may appear.
Smashing standard of components.
This game, set in past-times Arabia, can draw in the interest of non-geeks after a few turns, even the stone-faced "I don't have time for silly games!" GF.
Some gamers may be switched off by the heavy-handed religious tone relayed on the box. Ignore this. During play, the game has no religious feel, at all. I do feel that this style of game is quite abstract, actually, with a player's immersion factor in the game's theme quite shallow.

PS. Do not underestimate the power of the sheep when endgame scoring! My GF regularly tans my hide with sheep-points, and its not often I can get that sentence into a conversation.

RATING: 7.1
Take [thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing].  Remove the cloister.  Add a temple, which scores rather uniquely.  Replace the farm scoring with the field scoring from [thing=4390]Carcassonne: Hunters and Gatherers[/thing].  Add one ark, which you may move 1-5 spaces, rather than placing a follower.  Add a one-shot prophet, a follower who goes to a city in an attempt to score double in that city.  Add oases along the roads that each add one point to the completed roads.  Tweak the scoring of incomplete features a bit.  Now you have Ark of the Covenant.

The ark doesn't do much worthwhile, unless you've run yourself out of followers (not as likely in this game as in a nicely expanded [thing=822]Carcassonne[/thing]), or have drawn a crap tile.  ...and happen to have followers within 5 spaces of the ark, and a way to reach them without giving your opponents comparable points.  (The ark in this game is not nearly as exciting as Indiana Jones might suspect.)  Still, it's a fun enough game to play.  Its subtle differences from the other [family=2]Carcassonnes[/family] can bite you if you don't read the rules carefully, but a good and worthwhile game.

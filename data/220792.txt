Abstract: Area control board game mixed with the card event system from Twilight Struggle (you play a certain story). Plays with up to 4 players (best with 4 because you can play with all factions). Each player has asymmetric player powers. There is a lot of player interaction without being vicious with a lot of back and forth. Scoring dynamically shifts over the game. Rules are not very clear (ambigious wordings)

Thoughts: Seems like a very decent game with solid mechanics I like, but the mechanics of Twilight Struggle and the art/theme does not attract me at all. Beginners have to learn the cards for being able to compete.

Game with similar feel: 
* Tammany Hall (temporarily alliances, cutthroat)
* Twilight Struggle (action point / card event system)

I had the chance to playtest this a couple of times, and I really enjoyed it. I'm a fan of the TV series, and this game really captures the political intrigue and complex narrative of the story, but the gameplay is very straightforward and intuitive. Very excited for the release!

The Expanse is essentailly a simplified, multi-player adaptation of Twilight Struggle, whose setting is a battle for control of our solar system.  As in TS, cards can be used for action points or their event text can be implemented.  If the active player chooses action points, then factions whose icon appears on the card may choose in initiative order to implement the event text.  The faction that chooses this sinks to the bottom of the track; a nice little sub-system.  Unlike TS, players are not dealt hands of cards.  Instead, they can be purchased using vps from a row, with those further to the right costing more.  As in TS, there are cards that rigger a scoring seeded throughout the deck.  When the final scoring card is taken, it's game over.  The four factions are nicely differentiated.

What's not to like?  Well, like a few other commenters I have a feeling that the one and only correct strategy is to sit at the back in the vp race.  That's mostly because, as in every other area control game, there's a lot of leader bashing.  To this The Expanse adds the Rosinante, a potent catch-up mechanism in the form of a ship that gives the player with the lowest vp total an extra action immediately before scoring.   

The artwork makes much use of black and grey.  Combined with murky stills from the TV series, the overall effect is rather dull.  As a wargamer I'll not grumble about the cardboard chits instead of plastic space ships, but as a card gamer I will grumble about the flimsy cards.

I LOVED this game, but i played just once and won. I like the mechanic where you play cards but someone else use the card ability. Should be a 8 for me but i have the feeling that someone at the table will not enjoy his game (every time you play) since if everyone focus on one player he will have not fun time. So mechanics LOVED THEM, how you play the game.. maybe is not for me (too much war and interactivity)

Oy. Closest analog would be a 4P Twilight Struggle. Area control, cards with ops + events. Seemingly-neat way to determine who fires the event if ops are chosen: first person on a track gets a choice, and if chosen, they move to the bottom of the track. Seemed far too random in practice, though. Placement constraints were un-fun for me, unlike El Grande. Maybe if I loved the books/show?

RATING: 2
A dry and tediously repetitive poor man's version of Twilight Struggle. Unlike that game, there was no thematic ebb and flow of global powers manipulating their positions - this was just arbitrarily adding and removing cubes driven by card actions that had no thematic correlation to anything. Scoring, which happens six times throughout the game and takes longer to perform than the actions between, was unnecessarily fiddly and deprived of us of any motivation beyond finishing the game as soon as possible. A huge disappointment to the group, and the game went straight to the scrap pile.

RATING: 8
Initial rating after one play. I think the game has a lot of potential and I found myself really enjoying my first play even though I did awful. Love the use of the Twilight Struggle-esque card play where you can either take the event (if eligible) or take the AP but risk turning the event over to your opponents. 

Really want to play more.

The Expanse is a quick-playing area majority game that is decent at 2, but much improved at 3 or 4 players.

This is definitely a riff on card driven games (e.g., multi-use cards with action points and events to influence area majority) and COIN (e.g., faction asymmetry and faction-specific events). Those aspects are mixed with other familiar mechanisms (e.g., card drafting), some of which were found in El Grande. The Expanse keeps a good pace clocking in often at 60 minutes and, in my experience, never exceeding 90 minutes.  At three or 4 players, there's some interesting competition for the cards (e.g., the OPA is eligible for events that can also be activated by the MCR and/or the UN). The initiative track adds in a welcome penalty for opponents activating an event outside of their turn. Due to the targeted resource scoring, the board play doesn't seem to devolve into constant slam the leader style area majority. The Rocinante, as a catch up mechanism, is a pretty brilliant addition and thematic touch. The scoring mechanism adds in a nice arc to the game, as certain bands become less important in the 4th and 5th scoring. This seems to be an engaging, quick playing, card-driven game for 3 or 4 players. 

The game loses a lot at 2 players -- and not just the OPA and Protogen factions. For one, there's a lot less competition for cards. The UN has lots of events on 4 AP cards that are exclusive to them (e.g., the MCR cannot activate the event). The MCR has zero exclusive events on 4 AP cards. That is "balanced" by the MCR having lots of exclusive events on 3 AP cards. And since the initiative track is not used at 2 players, there's zero penalty for an opponent activating an event if you choose a card for APs. Due to the cards' distribution of event exclusivity, there's fewer enticing events that both factions really want to select (unless, for example, you are playing as MCR and desperately need the 4 APs or are in a rare game state where the UN won't benefit much from the event).

As for the production, yeah, there are issues. The cards are too dark and blend together when they are in the market. The text on the cards is not very readable when they are in the market. The board is fairly functional, except for the delineation of Jupiter and Saturn being in different bands. It probably would have been nice for the board to indicate that the final scoring is in all bands, but that's minor. The rule book is passable, but if you look too closely, there's a ton of ambiguity in the rules and, especially, the cards. For example, compare the text on the Nauvoo card, which can target opponents, and the text on the Razorback card, which cannot target opponents. As another example, the UN's tier I tech is also ambiguous if you look too closely. Note that for the most part, your initial interpretation of the text is correct, but if you attempt to be completely consistent with the effect of the cards' text, the game can devolve into an unworkable mess. This is due, primarily, to the inconsistent use of "each" vs "a", "opponent" vs generic wording, etc.

RATING: 8
Does what it does exceedingly well.  It is a multiplayer area control game that utilises the We the People Card Driven Game mechanic where you can do the event or action points but if you do the action points it might let someone else do the event.  It is really easy to teach and play but packs a good amount of interesting decision in.  I dont know much about the show and I never felt that immersed in the theme but it is a fun, quick playing game.  The timing of the last scoring card particularly could swing the end score a lot which is a small concern but I do think any game where up to 4 players can be attacking each other or may or may not defend against giving each other powerful turns shouldnt be taken too seriously anyway.  There is not as much narrative as with other CDGs, partly because the events are uneventful, they can be powerful but they do not tell a lot of story, there is no "built the berlin wall" or anything like that.  Still possibly the best entry level multiplayer game of its type out there.

Interesting use of some of the mechanisms from Twilight Struggle.  Not sure the theme of the show comes through really well, but that might be a good thing since I think people who know nothing about the show can just enjoy a political intrigue game in space.  Currently at a 7 on rating, but could see this swinging up or down with more plays.  Also only played at 4 players, so want to try the other player counts.

I liked how the cards worked with the powers. Really nice and smooth mechanics. The theme didn't add anything but confusion to me, and so I started reading the book. And I don't understand how the board game fits with the plot besides just stealing the universe...

RATING: 8
Played at GenCon 2017 - very enjoyable game of influence and area control, with a clever mix of basic actions and special actions from card play.  Very similar to Twilight Struggle's action point vs. event decisions, but in a much more streamlined and fast-paced game.  I know nothing of the TV show The Expanse and still had a great time playing this.  Recommended.

RATING: 5.5
Borrows some mechanics from Twilight Struggle, but fails to capture the imagination or actually make these decisions interesting - instead the decisions are agonising and unfortunately it's one of those games that the person who analyses the hardest will likely win.

Don't feel that it's super balanced and your faction essentially dictates your exact strategy with little variation. The theme is pretty shallow and the board is very boring.

Not to say it's a bad game. It was... OK. Not rushing to play this again in a hurry and would suggest other games before agreeing to play again to be honest.

A nice implementation of Twilight Struggle mechanics into a light multiplayer game that stays true to its theme (I have never played the COIN series so I can't compare it to them). I like the clever theming of some of the cards, and think the implementation of the Rocinante is both a cool catch-up mechanic and a nice thematic twist.

The two-player game is balanced and fun, if a little dry. I feel the game would be much more interesting with a full compliment of players. But if you're into the show (or books), and you don't have the time to play Twilight Struggle, this might be up your alley.

RATING: N/A
After quite enjoying Fog of War, I was curious to give this a try. I kind of like The Expanse TV show in a casual way, although I thought the books weren’t great. I have pretty mixed feelings about the games he’s riffing on here (Twilight Struggle and COIN). So that’s not exactly a super-solid foundation on which to build, but it’s not nothing.

I think what this does right is that it has a quick and easy pace of play, with a nice escalating arc. Both COIN and Twilight Struggle are, for me, absolutely murdered by their play length and sometimes tedious pacing, This moves at a brisk clip and with some momentum. The play time of 60 minutes or so is perfect, it would have been so easy to make this egregiously overlong (see: almost every COIN game). The system is much cleaner and more intuitive that Twilight Struggle. The 4-player assymetry isn’t spectacular but is nice. The event preemption model works rather nicely, and I actually find the core card/activation engine superior to the COIN system in a number of ways.

The actual gameplay though is pretty uninspired. It’s just an area control euro without enough constraints to be anything more than a pick-on-who-you-think-is-winning game. Like COIN, it’s basically a less-well-functioning El Grande. El Grande really nailed this problem, and you really want to look at how it works and what it did right if you’re going to tackle this sort of game. This is just too random, in that it doesn’t give you the personal motivation to do anything other than pick on the winner, which makes for a kind of pointless-feeling game.

The themaitc tie-in is actually ok, but it can’t make up for the underlying weakness of the game.

Fantastic integration of Twilight Struggle/COIN yet cut lean and seasoned with The Expanse setting. It plays very quickly yet captures the politicking of the series well. 

Physically the game is a bit bland, but it's not altogether poor.

I originally gave this a 9.5 only because I wished I could play all of the factions at 2 or 3 players. Well now, thanks to the designer really caring about the game he put out there I can. This is a perfect ten in my book. It's Twilight Struggle for 2-4 players in 60-90 minutes set in the amazing world of the Expanse SyFy series based on the hit novels by James SA Corey. I'm really hoping there are some... Expansions (hahaha... I slay myself).

This is a good, lighter, card driven area control "war game".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
The innovation here is a marriage between the APs/event choices in Twilight Struggle with the event system of the COIN system (whereby only certain factions have the option of using any given card). So, one player chooses the APs and one of the factions (on the card) may use the event. In lieu of using the event, a faction may instead keep the card and play it later or (even better) during a scoring round for an extra, last-minute tweak to the board. 

Another innovation on the TS model is that when a player plays a scoring card, they choose which area on the board to score. They keep this momentarily secret until everyone plays any of those kept cards mentioned above. The factions are all different and representative of the source material (big fan of the show here). 

But in what seems like an odd design choice, your influence markers are limited. So in the last third of the game when you choose an AP card, you very well have to move your markers on the board because you have no more to place (happened to me fairly early on). 

So you’re left with the decision of leaving an area where you have control to try and break up the perceived leader in another area. The result is you’re simply robbing Peter to pay Paul without feeling like you’re making any forward progress.

While the innovations are neat on paper, the whole for me added up to less than the sum should have. The game is tactical whack-a-mole with adding and removing cubes and arguing about who the real threat at the table is and trying to stay in last so as not to draw attention until the right moment. 

That might be OK if the game were in the same neighborhood -- or even belt -- as the listed play time of 60 minutes, but we were 2.5 hours in and had to call it due to time. Had at least another 30 minutes to go.

I’m glad I played it once but after sleeping on it, I feel like my one play was enough to see what the game has to offer. I’m not curious as to how the other factions might play or trying out strategies. It’s far, far too tactical for strategies other than stay in last as long as reasonably possible.

The mechanics  are fine for the weight of the game, but the theme feels pasted on which is especially evident in the cards.  I think the more you're familiar with the source material the more annoyed you will be with the presentation.  Production values are fairly low given current standards.

As a fan of the TV series, I was really anticipating to play and even own the board game. When I finally got to play it this week, I was left a bit disappointed. Components and artwork aside, which had the potential to be richer and more immersive, the theme does not really take off here. 

The game is not bad and does grab you, perhaps a tad too much that you are focused mostly on the mechanics themselves. I almost never bothered to look at the card's title, or the artwork, having to focus on whether my faction's icon is present on it, which would indicate that I can trigger its "event" ability and what its effect would be. 

There are a few other problems with the game. For one, it does suffer from AP, especially with new players, and this can drag the game quite a bit longer. Second, it can have a runaway leader effect: our entire game, the player standing did not change from the first to the final (6th) round of scoring.

Overall, people looking for thematic immersion and ties to the book or TV series will be disappointed. This is not equivalent to BSG in either the theme or scale. However, players primarily looking for a mechanically decent gaming package may find it enjoyable.

Area control and take that in a game where luck of the draw and king maker plays big parts in how wins. Can I possibly like that?

Well, yes sort of. It is a quick game and you have interesting options on your turn. 
Do I play a card for actions or for the action on the card? If I play it for actions another player may play the card for the card action for free. And if there is a scoring card, do I take it to decide what area gets bonus scoring or do I take something else to improve my positions on the board. 

 Everyone also have interesting special abilities. 

Mixed feelings about the game. Would like an engine to build. Now the whole game is taking a card to get actions...to get majority on areas...which you will loose on other players turn, the progression is small during the game. You get a new ability after each scoring but that is not a big thing and nothing I can affect.

Manages to miss both "thematically satisfying" and "mechanically elegant," instead landing squarely in the awkward middle of "kind of mediocre." A lot of stuff happens, sure, but this is just El Grande without the polish. The cards are also pretty unreadable unless they're right in front of your face, which manages to be surprisingly obnoxious.

I got this title Dec 2017 from Amazon. I've only seen the pilot episode but watched a review of the game by Sam Healey and decided that it was something I wanted to try.

Very intriguing area control game with a little bit of a Twilight Struggle mechanism -- you can use a card to put influence on the board, but other players get to use the events on the card, which may be bad for you.  What's really interesting is how this game makes that a multiplayer thing by instituting an initiative track -- any player taking advantage of the events must move to the back of the line.  
Although I don't think that the game really needs the Expanse theme to justify itself, I do think that this is a good way of capturing a lot of the conflict that takes place in the show, and since I'm a fan of the show, it's always fun when something happens like a player using the Miller card to get Julie.  
We misplayed the scoring rounds badly, though, so I'll definitely need to play again with the right rules. (1 play)

Love the simplistic rules and the tight gameplay. Disliked the bland look, so pimped the components (metal ships from brigademodels.co.uk and changed the influence cubes into agent meeples), which brings tons of theme to the game. This, and the fact that slow thinkers can really slow the game down, are what keeps me from rating it a 10.

Very good strategic game! A plus for me because I love the tv show. I just wished my gaming buddies like it more... Muy buen juego. Condensa un mecanismo de manejo y uso de cartas para usarlo en un juego relativamente corto. Básicamente debes controlar áreas del tablero moviendo influencia mediante las acciones de las cartas que juegas. Tema diplomático en contexto de ciencia ficción. Tú representas una facción y debes procurar mover estratégicamente tus unidades para controlar zonas del espacio. De 2 a 4 jugadores, pero el modo para 2 no es muy bueno.

The expanse seems to be a perfectly good game. But nothing about it really grabbed me in a way that makes me want to play it again overly much. It's mechanically sound, and decently fun. But not 'special'.

Perhaps its the largely tactical feeling of that first play. Maybe it's not as loaded towards that side as it feels with some more experience.

It doesn't feel very thematic generally, and certainly isn't very evocative of the book or TV series.

I'm not a fan of the source material, but that being said, this was a pretty solid game. It certainly warrants its comparisons to Twilight Struggle and the COIN Series, but isn't nearly as deep in comparison. And I think that's the one thing holding this game back, for me. I'm familiar with the IP, but this game is both dry and fairly light, which isn't usually a good combination for me. Cards give you powers, but with a few exceptions, they don't really match the characters or events they're assigned to.

This is purely area control with an interesting form of card drafting, but nothing is all that captivating. Again, it's a solid game, but it's so mechanical and so much lighter than the COIN Series that I'm not sure who this game is for. Aside from diehard fans of The Expanse, I suppose.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]If you have played Twilight Struggle or 13 Days: The Cuban Missile Crisis you'll have a good understanding of how The Expanse plays [i](it falls between the two in terms of weight)[/i]. The Expanse uses the same card driven, area control mechanisms as the aforementioned games, with the biggest difference being The Expanse plays up to four. Cards can be used for action points or to trigger the event on said card and with 3+ players there is an initiative track which determines who gets the right of first refusal for an event [i](if the active player uses a card for the action points)[/i]. When playing with 3+ players there is an element of diplomacy in so far as you try to get your opponents to focus their aggression on each other and not you. The other major addition are the ships you control which count towards planetary control and you need ships in orbit of a planet you want to place troops on. This adds another layer of planning in order to execute your strategy effectively. 

Personally I found The Expanse to be more fun than 13 Days [i](which I do still enjoy)[/i] in large part because of how dynamic the player interaction is a 3+ player game of this type. The design is clean and not cluttered by superfluous or fringe case rules and the game moves a long at a brisk pace. This was definitely the biggest surprise of the month for me since I hadn't heard of the game before I played. I'm looking forward to playing again; unfortunately this isn't the type of game I could get played in my house so it'll have to be a game I play with my gaming group when the opportunity arises.[/i]

The Expanse is an area majority game based on the popular novels/TV show.  On his turn, a player selects one of the five event cards available, paying victory points for those that came out more recently.  Then, the player either performs the action text, or takes the number of action points printed on the card.  However, if a player uses the points, another player will get a chance to use the text.  This all fuels area majority at a number of locations in three areas: the inner planets, the belt, and the outer planets.  Scoring occurs via cards that are mixed in the action deck, and the player taking the scoring card chooses an area to be worth a lot of bonus points.  The mechanics all worked very well together--turns out area majority is a very good thing to do with a Twilight Stuggle-like card system.  However, it never really captured the feel of the show to me.  That said, I did enjoy it.

RATING: 6
PRODUCTION/ART/GRAPHIC DESIGN QUALITY: Poor
The game feels cheap. The board art is basically a composition of clip art. Not really interesting or evocative. The tokens and cards feel thing a cheap. Not sure why they have flimsy tokens instead of plastic ships, as they are only a few ships in the game. Worst of all, the cards feature poorly capture screen grabs from the show.

THEMATIC INTEGRATION: Poor
It doesn't really feel like your ever immersed in the world. Because you don't really hold the cards in your hand, just choose then from the row, you only ever look at the effect. Because I've watched the slow and read the books, I could see the connections... but a friend I played with, who hasn't see/read the series, said after the game that he now new nothing more about the series or what it was about. Only a hair's breath above a pasted on theme. 

GRAMEPLAY: Good
All the above said: the game play is, mechanically speaking, respectable. It's a pretty simple game. But that's not necessarily a bad this, and it is pretty quick. Agreeable enough, but not especially memorable. I feel like there are others which do the same sort of thing better, even if this one is quick (effectively a long filler, with experienced players). If only they could address the above.............................

Final note: Only worth playing with 4 players.

Area control using influence. Some describe as COIN-in-space but more like 4p Twilight Struggle with COIN-ish mechanics.

Fun thematic area-majority game. I really like the card dynamic, a bit like CDG's, COIN or Twilight Struggle, where you can select a card for its event or action points (ops).  I prefer how they are visible rather than in player's hands, and how non-active players get a chance to activate the events if you use it for ops.  I have not watched the Expanse yet, so the cards didn't mean anything to me, but it's really just titles - my friend who knows the show didn't seem particularly excited by the card references, whereas with a historical CDG some the event cards become very memorable because of the history that they relate to.  I would have like the events to be tied more to specific factions, as opposed to just the world types.  I also wish the event text was a bit easier to read from a distance or if some iconography could have been used in conjunction with the text, just because you're trying to glance at 5 at a time.  It feels like a lighter El Grande that works well with 3.  Your influence cubes are more static so once you invest in fighting for an area, you don't expect them to move much.  Competition over fleet control adds a nice additional feature to the less dynamic cube majority competition.  I would have liked each faction to have a deck of tech - like 3 level I, 3 level II, and 3 level III, and you have to select which one you want during each of the first 3 scoring rounds. As is, at least the 3 factions we played with all have the same level II tech, Open Warfare; it seems like it would have been a simple feature in the design to create some choice with how you want to tailor your faction's strategy by having multiple tech to choose from.

--Oct2017-- This is an interesting test case:  I love the books, and - perhaps as a result - think that the idea of the game is pretty compelling.   But my regular game gang aren't as familiar with the series: they might be a hard sell.

Fascinating area control game. I've got a couple plays under my belt at 2P which I  thoroughly enjoyed. Looking forward to trying it with a full complement. Easy to learn, but it is apparent that it has a great deal of depth and variability.

:soblue: Blue's tie break ability too strong

I'm a fan of the show and this game is touted as the 4p version of Twilight Struggle, so I thought this would be a no-brainer.  Well, I'm sad to say that I was pretty underwhelmed.  First off, the graphic design is not the best - all the screen caps are dark so everything blends together.  I found the game mechanics to be pretty good, but I didn't like that from about the halfway point, our relative places didn't change.  The one thing that I don't think works as good as it should is that the order of being able to trigger the event isn't actually tied to the event - it's initiative.  I like the way the COIN events make each event specific to certain factions first.  It just made this game feel kind of...generic.  I'm glad I tried it and I can appreciate what it's trying to do, but Twilight Struggle (or COIN) it ain't.

Area control game with special powers. I can't comment on the IP portion as I have never watched the series. The game play is ok, nothing particularly stands out to me.

Not a game for me. Too much take that and no theme at all. It is only about placing influence cubes. There is really missing something here

This is a good game, but not in a way I hoped. It seems to be missing the heart of the series it's based on and while it feels balanced, it suffers from the same issue as Twilight Struggle: you need to play it too much for it to become tight.

Great card mechanic (similar to Twilight Struggle) and the theme matches the game play well.  The Rocinante mechanic, in particular, is a great element and evokes the show accurately.  Very poor card picture quality, the pictures are dark and hard to see.  I'm fine with chits for ships, but would happily pay for ship models based on the show if they were available.  I'm also hoping for a 3rd season expansion.

I know nothing about the media the game is based on, but I nonetheless found this to be a very enjoyable area control game. It feels like a simpler version of Twilight Struggle mixed with El Grande.

This is a huge surprise, and not only because it makes me like stupid Captain James Holden a little more. By mixing relatively straightforward "control these bases" gameplay with a card system straight out of Twilight Struggle or the COIN System, The Expanse positions itself as one of the best licensed games not published by Gale Force 9. A complete triumph of thematic design, complete with distinctive factions, off-turn event manipulation, and an incredibly brisk playtime.

If you’re familiar with CDG’s or the COIN series from GMT, then aside from a couple of clever tweaks, there is nothing to see here. The game is aggressively bland with almost no theme andprecious few decisions to make. Combat was almost non-existent. Interaction amounted to cube removal vs cube placement. The tech tree has no branches. The Expanse would have benefited from implementing more from the source material to give the events a sense of place and the factions a bit more to distinguish them. A series of events that reflect Belt uprisings tossing influence out or similar events for particular locations to make them feel like more than an arbitrary symbol in a box would have done a great deal here. The factions do play differently, but having the same level 2 tech is entirely pointless. Overall, the game was shallow, boring and short without  evoking anything significant from the Expanse.

Played with designer at gencon 2017 and with buddy/reviewer chuck theel, outstanding area influence game, innovative action selection, you don't have to be a fan of the show to appreciate the brilliance of game design.  Geoff's star as a designer continues to rise and this is a major accomplishment.  Not sure if the board art is all it could be but from a gameplay perspective it's outstanding.  I'd put it in a category with Tammany hall, have to try to see how this game just hums, well done all.

This is quickly becoming one of my favourites. Learning/teaching the game is easy. It takes a while to understand how everything fits together, though, so the game can be rather confusing at first. Half-way through the first game the very clever and intricate ways the various factions interact becomes more clear. When that happens, the game gets really fun and every action becomes an agonizingly difficult decision.

The AI bots are cumbersome, so I definitively prefer playing as 4 persons. The Vassal module is excellent and the game works well PBEM.

2nd edition rules render A Distant Plain a quick learn and easy grasp. Its challenge comes in internalizing your faction’s victory conditions and making its parts work in your favour. In other words, this game takes 10 minutes tops to set-up. What you do with the few hours after that is pure gameplay. Unlike other COIN games (maybe with the exception of Fire in the Lake—and I own them all to date) ADP works best solo with at least a couple of its bots in play. Other COIN games play out easily solo with all factions under the gamer’s control but once again, those victory conditions are ruthless, at times complementary, and require something more than a split personality to run competitively. Kudos to COIN for its bot mechanics in toto.

Have you ever been standing in front of, say, a book shelf or a CD collection or maybe the ward robe of a friend and thought "wow, I'd love to be that person"? "I would love to have such a good taste, to be so smart, so witty, so creative"? 

And then you get a bit depressed because you realize that you will never be as cool as this guy. That you're boring. And average. And normal.

That's how I feel about A Distant Plain. I would love to be the kind of person that likes and plays A Distant Plain. It has an interesting and relevant and even educational theme, the components are impressively beautiful, the game mechanics are smart and creative. There is a certain sexy mathematical vibe (yes, I just wrote "sexy mathematical vibe", deal with it) I get from the balance of the four different interest groups of the game. 
But then again, I simply am NOT the type of person that reads Nietzsche or listens to Aphrodite's Child albums or wears crazy socks (actually, the 666 album is awesome, but I don't understand Nietzsche and I want my socks as black as possible). Although I would love to be that person, I simply don't feel like I could get through with that. Well, I guess somebody HAS to fill up that big fat pile of probability mass in the middle of your Gaussian ... How about a round of Carcassonne?

 Juego del sistema COIN. Interesante y divertido, pero, posiblemente demasiado caótico. La única vez que lo jugué estaba convencido de que lo estaba haciendo fenomenal y al final logré que ganase el gobierno mientras yo estaba jugando con los Señores de la Guerra. Pero es curioso, caótico e interesante.

RATING: 8.5
A light game actually made heavy by the strategy that it offers via 3 aspect. The cards, the independent options of each faction and the interaction between players, that creates the dynamics of the game.

It's one of those games that proves victory is possible if you are able to hold on to your gains.

A steep learning curve on an otherwise simple mechanic, made to suffer from a rather poorly written and worded rule book.(too briefly written, till the rules are not convey in proper) The 'commas' and 'hyphens' were printed in such a way that makes the rules statement ...... Vague.

Like Britannia, this game plays best with 4 real players. The decisions they make followed by errors on when to commit, makes the game dynamics - fluid. Programmed player makes the game, 'controllable'. Which makes it possible to orchestrate an action to happen or not. 

The activation of guerrilla units is an interesting mechanic taken from Eurogames and it works well here.

Victory requirements are well set whereby 1 factions' needs are intertwined with the other factions.

Overall, a good game that is challenging for both beginners and hardcore gamers.

Interesting system, but numerous things left it unsatisfying for me. Even after two plays it's very hard to look at the board and understand the ramifications of the position. The board gives little "narrative" (although interactions between players does, and does that very well). At beginner level (at least) a lot seems to ride on the timing of the Propaganda cards, and guessing when to "jump". Many events are very swingy. Found the system interesting enough that I'd play COIN again, but I'd rather try a different one of the series.

Excellent game.  At least every bit as good as its predecessor Andean Abyss, with a good bit of chrome and nuance that suit it to the war in Afghanistan.  The interaction between the two COIN factions is particularly fascinating.  I definitely want to play this again.

This is one of those games that just falls into your hands, and you're completely blindsided by how amazing it is. I hadn't heard of it until 3 weeks ago, acquired it two weeks ago, and now I wonder how any other Asymmetrical game can hold water compared to it. 

It's Chaos In The Old World with teeth and more on the line.

It's Twilight Struggle with more players and harder decisions.

It's dominant species with a better theme.

The hard part about it, and the only reason it does not score a 10 for me, is that it isn't particularly accessible. I can't just sit someone down and teach them this game, they really need to play Andean Abyss first. It isn't that the rules are necessarily complex. I feel like anybody can "get it" after a few cards. It's that the interactions between each player are so complex that a single player knowing what they're doing can run away with the game... 

The best example would be an experienced Khorne player in Chaos in the Old World playing with three newbies. This isn't entirely a bad thing, after all, good play SHOULD win the day in most games. It just makes the game less accessible, and less likely to hit the table.

The other problem with its accessibility is that the easiest game scenario (the extended campaign) is the also almost a two-day event. Even experienced players claim to require 6 hours to complete it. Inexperienced players can expect up to 12. Ideally the short campaign should be the easiest. "Mr. Obama's War" takes the war in Afghanistan from roughly 2008 until present. The problem, of course, is that the conflict is already heavily involved. There are pieces all over the map and it can be utterly overwhelming to start there. The extended scenario starts with hardly anything on the board, which makes for a much simpler digestion of each faction's actions. This is very much like Republic of Rome, where the easiest ruleset is the "Early Rome" scenario, and is also the hardest to not lose.

Finally, a note on the bots - they are brutal, and in more ways than one. Now, for a game like this the AI has to be pretty finely tuned to compete with a human player. These bots certainly are. While slightly game-able, they will beat even an experienced player with their fairly simple strategies. It's hard to learn how a couple of their actions work, however - Government Train, Taliban March both come to mind. Regardless, it was a huge endeavor to provide a bot for every non-player faction.

Amazing game. Hope to get it to the table with humans _very_ soon.

The third installment in the COIN series is a beast, and absolutely the more complex to date: it has a huge map, every faction has lot of pieces, events seem more powerful and factions interaction is quite convoluted.

Government and Coalition live in a symbiosis, spend the same resources and pursue different final objectives, but have kinda the same mid-term goals. Sometimes the resources are scarce, because both want to spend before the ally can use them for himself.

Taliban are the typical insurgent faction, but their relationship with Pakistan brings an interesting twist to decisions they face.

Warlords are definitely the more interesting "fourth faction" of the series so far: they're kinda passive, but have more arrows to their arc than Cartels in Andean Abyss or Syndicate in Cuba Libre.

Apart from these considerations, A Distant Plain shares the same pros and cons of the other games in the series: it is a very very interesting simulation of a complex asymmetric war theatre, that's not very complex (it has a definite "eurogamer appeal"!) once you've mastered, but at the same time it's quite hard to learn to play well (not as far as the rules are concerned, but as regards weighing options and take decisions), and it is quite long (the short game is very welcome, since it can last "only" four hours).

Eager to play it again!

Whoa... Ton's of interesting decisions to go along with a very thematic game.  The game is super rule heavy, and its going to take a play to really understand how to play / What is good to do.

Could see this moving up after more plays (so far only 1 incomplete game).

REALLY love the theme.  The way each faction abilities work all fit what they represent.  The way the victory conditions are all intertwined was super interesting as well.  If only the game was an hour (or 2?) shorter, I could see me wanting to play this a ton!

My first foray into the COIN series after having heard a lot (favorable) about Andean Abyss, so no comparisons here. Played a three-player version (Warlord as 'bot) with myself as Taliban. First of all, I have to say how impressed I am with the basic COIN engine. Not the first multi-player game to have different factions with different aims and ways to win (see "Sword of Rome," "Revolution: The Dutch Revolt," among others) but the turn order and action/event sequencing via the card system is unique and ingenious. The theme is well executed and you truly feel you are getting a realistic insight into the dynamics and challenges of the region from the card deck and general design.

I would not say this is a simple game to get into, so a good teacher/tutor is going to make a lot of difference to one's impression of the series. I think one will need to play each faction several times to truly grasp what is going on but I'm intrigued enough to want to try.

Volko is impressing me very much with his designs and Brian has made some important contributions to the series through his study of asymmetric warfare and the result is a superior game that is bound to rise fast up the charts!

Slightly better than AA simply because the setting is more accessible. Game does a great job of creating the same sort of dynamics we see in the real world, with the Gov and Coalition falling easily into bickering, the Taliban being the obvious target, and the Warlords being easily overlooked. Can't say enough good things about the game. I wish I could play it more...

Plays and feels much the same as AA. I guess one could

but the difference here is that this is such an abstract
game. I've said elsewhere - I wouldn't want different
versions of Junta for every political instability, 
and likewise, this system gets tired for me.

Flavor cards and nuances in the structure of the
factional alliances do distinguish, but it seems mainly
dressing.

A couple of plays into it now (4-person games). I really am having fun.

I like the larger scope in this game compared to the Cuban-themed game from the same series (although it has its own charms). By which I mean more provinces, a neighbouring Pakistan with its swinging allegiance, population displacement, etc.. There is a fair amount to consider here with each player activation, yet with experience I find that I am taking less and less time to make my decision. 

I am also at that stage where I can come up with some nub of a plan and try to carry it out. Along those lines, I think there is enough under the hood to try different tacks towards victory. 

There is still that thin veneer of a Euro feeling (due to some player abilities) for me which did bother me at first, but I have begun to loosen up over time since I am enjoying the game so much. It also helps to see results of individual moves as the result of long term efforts, not just spur of the moment actions. For example, if I use the Warlord's Suborn ability to remove three government cubes from a province, it feels too powerful for the amount of groundwork I put into making the move. Yet, that uneasy feeling dampens once I consider the effort I made to accumulate the resources for the bribe, etc.. 

I think successful play requires balancing wheels within wheels and I like that.

Ultimately lost interest in and sold this; the back-breaker is the fact that the Warlords positions is so constrained and boring to play, but somebody's got to do it. Now that we have Fire in the Lake, that game is just better. For someone more into COIN than me, this might be worth having - the non-Warlord positions are quite interesting - but ugh, the Warlords.
---
Picked this up in the fall GMT sale (2013); not sure if it's been tweaked since my comments below on a late play test version, but it seems a little more satisfying. Playing the Warlords is a bit of a mug's game, though; give it to the guy who doesn't mind the passive faction, or play with 3. A shame that the green factions have not been reliably compelling (haven't played the published Cuba Libre yet, but in play test they were only marginally more interesting than the Cartels - so not very).

Been playing it solo just to come to grips with the games, and see if the solo experience is satisfying. The faction AIs seem distressingly stupid at times (they don't have a fallback option to go for money when very low on cash, and for the Taliban particularly but also the warlords this seems to end up with questionable and very limited play, repeatedly doing stupid march + infiltrate non-revenue-generating moves when they are cash constrained. It also doesn't help that the Taliban March instructions are vague and borderline incomprehensible). However, solo does seem like a very good way to prep for what is an exceptionally confusing and bewildering game system.

In general, A Distant Plan seems better than Andean Abyss - more thematically sound (although still at least hobbled by the lack  of hidden information), with better and more powerful events, and more interesting factional interplay.

Do stick with the short game, though. There really seems to be little point in playing more than 4 propaganda cards, and 6 just seems nuts unless all you want is something to occupy you for 6-8 hours.
---
One play on a playtest version 10/12; interesting ideas, but not impressed overall. The Warlords just play like the Cartels, and both the Taliban and Warlords play such restricted games that they are pretty railroaded. The Government/Coalition relationship is more interesting than the Government/AUC relationship in Andean Abyss, but that only goes so far. It's still too long, too much of a whack-the-leader-fest, and the theme is still to light. I had high hopes for the COIN series, but the real heavy lifting to turn it from a great idea into a great game has yet to be done.

For now, this is the best game in COIN series. All factions has hard edge to win, all must watch even its potential Ally (Coalition vs Government issue).
Subtle nuances between all factions: some has to manoeuvre, some could get straight to the finish line. Alliances are constantly changing. It depends who is leader to bash (or second to lead...)
Game portrays Afghanistan situation in very good way, giving players opportunity to share responsibility and main concerns of participants of this conflict.
 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
So if you know the COIN series, there is nothing in this one that will come as a galloping surprise to you. This did introduce the innovation of factions that are formally allied but working at cross-purposes (explored more vigorously in the subsequently produced Fire in the Lake) as well as a faction with unlimited resources who are penalized for casualties and greater deployment.

I enjoyed Fire In The Lake, but I am not 100% sold on its attempt to wedge a (somewhat) (more) conventional 2-sided conflict into the COIN framework, so I found ADP to be a refreshing change of pace that incorporated some of the interesting aspects of FITL while being more of a multi-sided free-for-all.

Those who are not fans of the "green" factions in Cuba Libre and Andean Abyss will not have too much to like in A Distant Plain. Personally, I find them kind of fun and a different experience to play, while making the overall strategic situation interestingly complicated.

So this is an update to my original review. Distant Plain is a Euro styled war game, hence, the wooden pieces. Even though there is a set of dice, you don't use them hardly. For the type of game it is, the Euro styled mechanics play much better and make more sense. You have far more control over your actions and the points accumulation mechanic of the different factions is great. To be honest, I'm not a fan of most war games. This may change, but I've had bad experiences with some PC war games that have turned me off to the genre. Granted, they were considered to be mediocre. This one is different and that's why it appeals to me so much. I love the play mechanics. They keep me really engaged. I had to be pretty dang focused to learn how to play this game. But I did. And I played two rounds. Didn't have time to play the whole game. I played as every faction so that I could really grasp the mechanics of the game. The next time I play, I'll play with bots. And I'm really looking forward to it.

I really like the asymmetrical winning conditions. And also like that the winning conditions appear to be pretty just, relative to each faction, for all the factions. And I really dig having to buckle down to wrestle control from another faction.

I would say that the three coin games I have, Liberty or Death , A Distant Plain, and Fire in the Lake are my favorite games along with Dice Masters and Eldridge Horror. It's like these COIN games speak to me. Just reading the instructions to learn how to play was engrossing.

Update: The strategy is coming to me. I'm quite positive that I still suck, but I'm getting better than I was. I can see the board better. I am currently playing as all the factions to get a better understanding of the game. And that has been very satisfying and addicting. I'm looking forward to playing against the bots.

First play (f-t-f) was the most bewildering gaming experience I have ever had, bar none. I hadn't played any of the COIN games before but the rules didn't seem that complicated, but I had no idea what to do or how to do it when it came time to move the pieces.

Second play on VASSAL and things started to click into place - you may need to play at least one game with each side before you get your head completely round the game. This play started out as a gripping experience that I was enjoying greatly - although that was partly the result of the online banter the game was generating. However, after the second propaganda card the experience started to pall - the game suffers badly from the normal multi-player conflict problem of any leader being targeted by the pack and in ADP it's particularly hard to defend as all factions have the means to hit anyone else.

Getting across the finishing line therefore seemed a bit of a lottery in terms of timing a push to the front and hoping a propaganda card turned up at the right time for you - something over which you have little control or much foreknowledge, unless it comes up as the last one or two possible cards. So basically you all shuffle along trying to stay in contention and hoping for a lucky lunge across the line.

Also, some of the events seem very overpowered - one card came up about a third of the way through the game which, had the Govt player taken it, would have wiped out the Warlord player (in terms of bases) completely - at the time this happened the Warlord player did not have a chance to take a turn or mitigate the card from when it first became visible.

The game also didn't really tell a story (beyond the trash talk the players added) it was just a bunch of cubes.

So to get the most out of the game takes four players who know what they are doing - not sure I will see that too often - it might still bite one player badly and it plays long. I still admire what the game is trying to do and there is some clever stuff in here, but I'm thinking COIN may not be for me - I still might be tempted by 'Fire in the Lake' but only if it plays well with two.

More similar to Andean Abyss than I expected although I played the Taliban, I imagine the Nato forces would be quite different. Its about the same weight as Andean Abyss for the most part, but some of the cards feel a little more involved and there is quite a bit more information to track. Is it better? Not sure, the setting is closer to home but the extra rules weight didn't add much more reward for me. In general i found it harder to come up with a plan but then I have only played the one game.

Another great COIN game.  This game highlights a lot of the challenges of the conflict.

It's very evocative too.  I remember the first time I sent an opposing coalition player's soldier to the "does not return to play" area.  Something like that hits home, given that the conflict is still ongoing.

IMO, this game succeeds in what it has set out to do.

Pretty good game and better than Andean Abyss in my opinion.  I'm not a huge fan of the COIN system and prefer hex & counter, but the fact you can make it a 4 player game adds fun for the social aspect.  A bit difficult to grasp at first since the COIN system is so unique.

While I love FitL and CL for various reasons, I think this is my favorite of all the COIN Games.  It seems to hit the prefect stride between complexity, playability, and fun.  My deepest concern is the Warlords faction, because it seems that he is most reliant upon the other factions fighting for supremacy (and able to neutralize control).  An Afghanistan that is carved up into zones is a game he cannot win.  Aside from that one blip, it definitely is a great game with lots of appeal!

Awesome game with well weaved menchanics.

The only downside to the game, and it is a game killer, is the large amount of ambiguity in the cards and the bots actions. I always ask myself what does this card do? Then I check the description of the card in the book, which is only a copy-paste of what is written on the card, which is completly useless. This par of the book should be more than just historical facts but also a clarification of the cards. The cards are not explained at all. For example, can I kill coalition forces directly with suicide bombers or is it like an attack? There is a cards where the text ends "for each card." which cards? Momentum cards? Propaganda cards? Already played cards? Just too much ambiguity.

A second edition rulebook and playbook would be necessary for any player to understand. Right now, only those who have played the first two volumes can understand fully what is written since it uses a wargame slang that is now explained in the rulebook or the playbook, so you can only guess what it means. Ambiguity is a real gamekiller, it ruins my fun.

Could you at least make a clarification of the cards and the bots' actions in the rulebook? I think the cards and AI action boards are just right, but you need to have a better detailed version of these in the rulebook and playbook for the cards. Too many questions arises in a game  and that ruins the fun as well as the gameflow.

If it weren't for that, I would give it a 8.5.

RATING: 8.5
Full disclosure, I pitched in a little on playtesting.

A very nice design, derived from the Andean Abyss, with some additional cross-dependencies, especially between the Coalition and the Government, and other twists like Coalition getting VPs for removing units.  Fantastic "bad marriage" dynamic between the Afghan government (Team Karzai) and the Coalition (ISAF).  A great game that helps to illuminate some difficult to understand aspects of the conflict in Afghanistan.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent game.

 I especially love how the two COIN factions work; their co-dependence is a very interesting dynamic that opens up for a lot of different strategic approaches, negotiating  and backstabbing. 

The LoC, Pashtun/non-Pashtun regions, and the Taliban's relationship with Pakistan are all nice additions that - among other things - makes geography and area control even more important. 

All in all a very satisfying gaming experience. A tad too long perhaps, but hat's usually how it goes with these types of games.

RATING: 5
Better than Andean Abyss, at least. The events have been appropriately beefed up and there is some very interesting cooperative/competitive tension between the various factions. This only slightly mitigates the core issues of Andean Abyss, however, namely that this is an overly obtuse whack-the-leader game. I wish someone would do something more interesting with the activation sequence.

RATING: 8
This is a really good game. I've played it once and it's not for the feint of heart. It took us a couple of hours to get through the tutorial and understand the rules. That being said, I feel like the tutorial was a bit more complicated than it needed to be and the rules aren't as complicated as it initially makes it seem. There's a lot going on and a fair bit of bookkeeping but the rules themselves aren't overly complicated. 

This game does an amazing job of capturing the war in Afghanistan. I've been there a couple of times and from a strategic perspective myself and other players fell into the same traps and quagmires that have kept this conflict going on so long. I feel like with subsequent plays we'll figure out how to actually "game" it some, but it was really neat watching all of us make the same mistakes that the Taliban, Coalition, and GIRoA made in this conflict. Would definitely recommend for history buffs or war game lovers.

I'm giving this a 7 because, while I've heaped praise on it, there's a high barrier for entry to this game and I think even if you know how to play and jump in then you have to dedicate several hours to it. Thus the rating of 8 because I would have to be "in the mood" for a game of that length, but it does such a beautiful job of capturing what it represents that I've bumped it up. Awesome game.

Really cool game. The asymmetry is done really well and the theme really comes through. The major downside I'd say is that it really relies on the players policing each other and so one person could ruin the game by helping another player more than themself without realizing. But this is also a big strength of the game. If you have four players who all know what they're doing then it can be a really interesting dynamic of needing to help each other sometimes but not doing it too much, since the factions are so intertwined and often their goals will align slightly. There was also a minor annoyance in the way the cards determined priority order since it will be easy for there to be big swings where one player seemed to be going first a lot in a row and then all of a sudden they'd be stuck going second every time they were eligible, and second is way worse than first. This should even out over time unless a propoganda card comes up right after a lot of big turns for one faction.But this is a very minor complaint in an overall really fun game.

RATING: 7
The COIN system is a brilliant way of engaging players in the internal political strife of a given country. Most war games concern themselves with boots on the ground and subsequent tactics; the COIN series dares to ask the socio-economic, religious, ideological, and political questions driving the conflict. The nuts and bolts of these designs are equally incredible: an ingenious method of card-assisted play and turn order, menus of asymmetrical actions and goals, and a level of player interdependence rarely seen in games.

COINs third installment, A Distant Plain tackles the recent conflict in Afghanistan, allowing players to experience the war from familiar (Coalition), complicated (Government), misunderstood (Warlords), and adversarial (Taliban) perspectives. Individual decisions are hard enough without factoring in the connections and ramifications of each action upon the group. As an extra, there are two COIN factions this go around; unhappy bed-fellows constantly undermining one another. Immense, complex, and thought-provoking, the questions ADP provokes will stay with you long after the conflict is decided.

ok, I feel that this is good game. 

But for some reason I do not enjoy it so much. For my taste it is little bit too much on dry side. Also I usually do not like multiplayer games with beat leader syndrom and constant backstabbing.

However this is first COIN game I wanted to try due to theme. I am looking forward to Fire in the Lake as this could be another great theme for me and also could be little bit on wargaming side.

First time playing this game is going to be painful, long, and you will make a number of mistakes.  While the actions may not be overly complex, the interactions between the four factions are very interwoven and decisions are not easy.  Each of the four factions have assymetrical powers and abilities with some shared actions and interactions. The faction that may be your friend one moment will be your enemy the next.  The aspect where not all factions will have actions on a turn was different (but I believe is typical of a COIN game?) - only two factions can take an action although you can choose to pass and gain a resource or few to reserve your opportunity to take an action next turn, particularly if the forthcoming card has a powerful event for your faction and you are first to go.

RATING: 7
Realistic wargame that simulates the tension that existed during the Afghan war between the Government troops, Al Qaida, Warlords and coalition.

Rules are not easy to grasp and I would advice a serious study of the rules before playing. Once the rules are clear, you can start thinking about the role you will have to play in the game with your faction. 

First impression (after incomplete game): Thematically interesting and realistic game with rules that are not easy to grasp. Material is appealing and functional. The game can be played solo, with the other factions that populate via a robot (flow chart). 

What I like about this game is that it sucks you into the theme, whether you like it or not. This is not pure mechanism, but a lot of real life strategy that you need to apply to this game.

Rating based on 4 players.

The design of this game is really intricate, with four completely asymmetric sides with different goals and different actions, all interacting in beneficial/parasitic ways. The COIN system of the different players having priority to act on cards is clever and presents hard choices. It simulates the Afghanistan conflict in a really interesting way, and I can see how this system could be a great educational tool.

I wanted to like this more than I did because I recognize the greatness of the design, but in the end it was just too much for me. There were too many rules and too many things to keep track of; due to the extreme asymmetry, it's like learning to play 4 games at once on the same board. I'm glad I played it, and I didn't dislike it, but it's not for me.

A brave and hugely instructive simulation of the messy reality of Afghan politics. Particularly like the unique, horrible co-dependency between the coalition and government players. There's a lot of like and admire here, but the administrative overhead in counter-shuffling is annoying, and there's a strong element of pegging back the leader.

These comments are from a solo perspective. It takes a bit to get the bots going properly but once you're in the rhythm this game just flows nicely. Tough and interesting decisions to make almost every turn. There is usually a shortage of everything -- you want to do way more than you can at this moment.  The coalition is very capable but at the same time completely helpless as the chaos erupts all over the country. The Government is fickle ally at best and actively works against your best laid plans (however, there are ways to 'play' the bots or at least stear them in some cases to actions better suited for you). Warlords must be reigned it otherwise they will take over after the 2nd prop card. Taliban are just nasty and can keep eligible over long times (eg see Playbook example). 

Sometimes this game game feels a bit too much like 'whack-a-mole' with the Coalition/Government playing fire brigade all over the country, other times it shows nicely that, no matter how much effort and money you put in, there might be no optimal strategy for the coalition. 

One last thing: this game can be perfectly left set up. Individual actions are small enough that you can complete them in a couple of minutes and the board captures the game state perfectly. At the sane time this game has this fantastic 'one more turn/card' feeling :)

Even the intro game took us a loooong time to play but I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I was the Warlords who rely on everyone ignoring them to have any chance, and they did not ignore me.  I learned a lot about geography but wish I had more time to study the card to learn a bit more of the history.  Appears quite well balanced.  I thin I am a COIN fan, and this is a good one.  If I can find one for trade or something I might go for it, but because of the topic and the length of play not much of a chance to play again outside a convention or similar event.

I'm a sucker for asymmetrical area control and this is the most grown up instance I've played. Definitely epic, though I haven't played enough to see if dramatic game changing plays occur or if it's just a matter of grinding the opponent down (which would admittedly be thematic). I don't love CDGs, but in this case the event is rarely better than a regular action. I like the indirect means of attacking the opponent, such as squatting on LOCs.

The theme is of course extremely delicious.

A Distant Plain, at least when compared to Fire In The Lake, seems extremely clear-cut. All the factions have very distinct identities and abilities, they feel balanced and the game is fun. I think that ADP (much like FitL) is extremely immersive and it always seems to feel like a war story when I get it to the table.

The rules are a bit long, but once you learn a single COIN game, you pretty much are going to have an easier time with all of them. It's totally worth every penny and minute spent.

[b]#3 A Distant Plain[/b]  (aka ADP)
1-4 players 

GMT´s COIN Series Game #3, designed by [person=772][/person] and Brian Train, covers the modern conflict in Afghanistan.

[q="Gameluis"]I understand there won´t be "friendly factions" here, will they? I like AA and CL because everyone fights everyone and doesn´t have to cooperate with other factions. That part of the COIN Series is lost in ADP y FTIL....[/q]

This comment regarding Gallic War (5th part in the COIN series), makes me wonder whether I would like ADP.

RATING: 9
A Distant Plain is a fantastic strategy game for four players (no more and no less, if you ask me). The game is even better than Andean Abyss, which I like a lot too. A Distant Plain is a good simulation; its thematic, fun, innovative, tight and really interesting to play. Warlords are a tricky faction to play at first, as their victory condition is hard to achieve and they can be hit pretty easily, but they are a great faction once you understand what you need to do with them. The 'bad marriage' of Coalition and Government is pure brilliance. When we play the main game, our sessions take approximately 9 hours.

Simply an awesome game, and one that keeps getting better each time I play it.  I find myself thinking about it even when I'm not playing it, lots of strategy and the 4 factions are quite distinct but all interact with each other in a way that means you need to help someone to achieve your victory conditions.  Just means the person you're helping may not always help you back!
Hats off to Brian Train and Volko Ruhnke for this game.
Well played sirs!

RATING: 8
Just starting to scratch the surface of this playing a friend's copy.  Demands both a lot of analysis of constant fluctuations in the game and some good luck with the card order.  Challenging enough to be quite frustrating when you can't do half of what you need to do - a recommendation in my eyes.  Probably best with 4 - playing more than one faction is a bit tiring, and requires more mental agility than I seem to have available these days.  The accuracy of the situation and tools for all sides is praised by my Afghan veteran friend, for what it's worth.  Warlord victory conditions seem tough to accomplish, moreso than the other factions, but as I said it's early in my acquaintance with the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
COIN number three and a cousin of Labyrinth insofar as it has tan and black pieces and deals with the civil war in Afghanistan. In many ways the best balanced of the series as the Coalition try to withdraw troops asap, leaving their Government allies in the lurch, who in turn are trying to set up a patronage power base, while the war/drug-lords and Taliban set about destablizing the country.

I am really torn here. The game mechanically is brilliant however it takes a very long time. I do not mind long games but this one seems to outstay its welcome a little even with the short game. I do not think I could sit through a long game but I will give anything a chance once. Still a good 6.

I doubt I will play this gain though.

Unbelievable title: in case you might ever think you are good at wargaming, ADP is going to disprove the proposition; on the site, many comments swing about - well, frankly - nonsense. It is to be suspected either that gamers aren't able to understand its greatness (and live up to its complexity); or that they just pretend to have ever played it

RATING: 8
The COIN series introduces a fresh mix of euro and wargame elements with card driven game play. Essentially, A Distant Plain is an historically based, area control game with asymmetrical faction objectives that works very well. There is a learning curve to the rules because they are unique but once you understand them everything falls into place and the game plays very smoothly. I highly recommend starting with the short scenario since game times can run long and only playing with 4 players not the AI.

Pros:
* Highly thematic and expertly conveys the asymmetrical goals of the competing factions.
* Looks great on the table.
* The graphic design and color scheme blend very well.
* The player aids are fantastic.
* Very strategic and tactical game play.

Cons:
* AP-prone gamers grind this to a halt - you have been warned.
* Game time is misleading, our short scenario games with 4 players have taken 8 hours.
* The scoring track and resource track should have been separated to make them easier to read.
* The manual confusing mixes pairs of faction abilities that should have been separated to make them easier to understand (refer to the player aids instead).
* A true 4-player only game unless you want to use the AI.

RATING: N/A
A solo game. I think 99% of the difficulty comes in the rulebook telling you what each action does mechanically, but not at all what purpose it may serve. The playbook helps, but I think bringing it to the table with my group is going to mean hours of "I hope what I'm doing is meaningful" until someone gets something wrong and gets another guy crowned the winner, and we all learn not to let him do that, and again... Probably best solo for my case.

09/01/2014: Played through the playbook scenario once, and am in the middle of my solo introductory session outside of the playbook. I have no qualms rating this game full marks because of the myriad options available for each faction.

I am blown away by the level of interaction between the factions which result from gameplay decisions. This clearly shows the incredible amount of thinking that has gone into the game to ensure that the game perpetually remains in a tug-of-war state until it is time for final scoring, so kudos to the game designers for an amazing game and experience.

RATING: 8
I had high hopes for this game. Initially, the rules were impenetrable. Then, I had the opportunity to play Andean Abyss, and with that experience, I was able to tackle the rules and get very excited about playing this. After my first play, I can tell that this is the game that really deserves a dozen or so plays to get a good feel for the experience. I think it will likely move to a '9' after a few more plays. It is a bit fiddly, and there is a lot of accounting to do. Games take a long time, and it takes a certain kind of gamer to enjoy this experience. I feel like a student of this game, initially overwhelmed and now excited for more. I stayed awake thinking about what I'd do differently next time. That is always a good sign for a game. I like this theme much more than Andean Abyss.

Credit where it's due, this is an incredibly thoughtful game whose mechanics really do bring the Afghan war to life on your table.   That said the rules extremely dense, and a couple of the asymmetric factions are far harder to play effectively than others.

This really captures the complexity of Afghanistan. Very similar to Andean Abyss, of course, but the victory conditions for each faction are so intertwined that the game is more tense overall. Lots of decision points, great components, excellent theme.

This is my first COIN game. Upon playing it the first time through I immediately bought three more games in the series. The interactions between factions makes for masterful gameplay and agonizing strategic decisions. In addition the game does wonders for showing you how much of a quagmire the War in Afghanistan really was.

Good game with simple mechanics but yet needing deep strategy and cunning when playing one of the 4 asymmetric  factions each trying to advance their own own objectives via a mixture of cooperation and conflict with one another. Theme of the game came out strongly once we figured out how to play and may need repeat plays to get a hang of things. 

Rating dropped (from 9 to 8 and lastly to 7) now that "Fire in the Lake" has come out and replaced it as the best COIN game. Also game now on hindsight does seems unbalanced towards the US who can simply do a unrealistic and sudden massive withdrawal to win the game. Warlord faction does not seem well integrated into the game's theme as well or a reasonable "ally" to the Taleban.

the unique take on card-driven events is very interesting, and the emergent dynamics are thematic (if not always strategically interesting).  The game can be a bit random in places, a little slow, and too much down time.  So, I'm not sure I'd actually play again, but I don't regret at all playing it once.  While asymmetric, the game does seem to be well balanced.  I worry a bit that under expert play it might become purely politics, but it might turn out to be much more strategic than first appearances.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The best in a great series--so far. Having a second COIN faction really changes the dynamics of the game, especially since they share the resources that can be spent and the US can move the Government's troops along with its own troops. It really highlights the differences between the two factions' objectives.

This is my second COIN game and I like the setting and its overall a good addition to the series.  The mechanics are similar to other games so there is not much new or different that you need to learn to jump in and play right away.  If you are new to COIN then its not a bad starting point, I'd still go to Cuba because of the size difference.

I'm really not sure about the balance among all 4 factions.  I just don't like the coalition.  Their paths to victory push the gov't ahead of them.  I find the gov't even harder to play and almost as tough to win with.  With other titles in the series I like more, this one will not be my first choice.
Update:  After playing more games in the COIN series, I enjoy this one the least.

This is a great game. Perfectly captures the infighting and quagmire that is the conflict in Afghanistan. Have yet to play with four players, but the game is pretty easy to solo as all four sides. Bots are not quite as fine-tuned as those in some of the later COIN games (especially the GovernmentBot), but this is still a must-have for anyone interested in any aspect of the 2000s "War on Terror."

Perfection. The COIN system is absolutely brilliant game design, and this is the setting that I find most interesting for it. I love the way it plays, and the theme that it so masterfully evokes. Corruption, terror, drug trafficking, counterinsurgency. This is the present-day Afghan conflict in a box.

This is one of those games which I've played once, really didn't enjoy myself at all, but came away thinking - wow - I'd love to try that again! 

I'm hugely impressed by the simulation of the issues facing the various factions in the game. The design is fascinating. I'm just not sure how well it works as a game. Just one play so far - long play time, ages of downtime, and a dice throw on the very first turn wiping out half my resources(!) were all very negative points for me. Actually this might well play better solitaire. Anyway - an impressive design - I'm glad I've had a chance to play this - I'll probably persuade myself to acquire it if it gets reprinted. It's a game I would almost certainly study a lot more than actually play, but I'm sure I'd enjoy that. Recommended - with caution! Edit: Not waiting for reprint - have just purchased what I suspect is the last retail copy of this in the UK!

For all the standard silly reasons I've bought a bunch of these COIN games without playing one, until now. So far so good! It was a learning game and we made loads of mistakes but all of us were eager to give it some more go rounds. I like the 4 players side-by-side element. I don't know how realistic it is but it felt realistic. Each side had its own advantages and each side had to play differently. Great, now I know! I played the Taliban like I was the Americans and paid the price! Hmmm, maybe guerillas shouldn't fight a conventional war?
It's rated pretty heavy but I didn't find the rules that hard to digest. I think the heaviness is more in absorbing how all the various sides need to interact to win. Plenty to learn here.

This game is long, and complicated; 4 of us played through the tutorial, then restarted with a short game. We called the game after the second Propaganda card; by then we had been playing for 7 hours and it was 3 am.

Heavier than Andean Abyss with the bots being more complicated to understand.  Does a good job of simulating the conflict and identifying the motivations of the various factions.

Also does feel more "military" than AA with the need for aggressive action against the Taliban (less so the Warlords) - perhaps this is because there are 2 COIN factions instead of just one.

Overall, intelligent treatment of the conflict and a worthy addition to the COIN series (and enough to pursued me to purchase a Fire in the Lake)

Just a superb game.  A brilliant mix of Euro and Wargame.  The theme really helps drive this one, and is very well integrated into the mechanics.  Bigger than Cuba Libre (physically and conceptually), so maybe better for some as their second COIN game. (I would have preferred to start with CL and then move to ADP, but they are both great.)

Modern conflict war game of several factions fighting in Afghanistan using the counter insurgency system. Same system as Andean Abyss. I really appreciate a game that builds in asymmetry as opposed to traditional "everyone has equal stuff". That must be much harder to balance. This game did a better job than the news and internet to help me to better understand the region and the positions (good or bad) of the groups in this brutally contested region.  Quite a bit of rule exceptions as a newb war game player.  If I liked war games, this would be one of them.

I can't imagine a richer and more intriguing setting and theme for a political wargame. Gameplay creates a unique story, an alternative history of stuff that actually went down. Before seeing it in action, I hated the idea of missing Hand Management, but the Card Drafting mechanic of COIN is simply brilliant. This is the best effort of multiplayer wargame with Variable Player Powers and unique victory conditions I have seen. Some factions are natural allies, some not so much, but their goals aren't necessarily diametrically opposite. Every decision in the chaotic insurgency/counterinsurgency situation takes all the brainpower a player has in this easy to learn but difficult to win epic system.

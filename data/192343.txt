RATING: 6
It is a good game that remind me of Candy Crush, only for 2 players. It would be good if I didn't knew another great game that remind me of Candy Crush that is much better and can be played from 2 to 4 players, Potion Explosion.

Overall it is a good game with simple mechanics of finding the patterns of equal colors and activating the power it gives.

Wonderful filler that perfectly transforms the popular bubble-pop videogame into a smooth playing boardgame, adding a few cool special powers to add depth.
Production is also snappy.

Bubblee Pop is a simple game and doesn't offer too much of a challenge. However, this is a really enjoyable game for me. It reminds me heavily of Puzzle Bobble (Bust-a-Move) which was one of my favorite arcade games growing up

Must have played this at least 10 times now on BGA. The gameplay is okay,nothing great. I would be fine if I never played it again, but don't mind playing. there's a good amount of luck involved with the color of bubbles that com out which is frustrating. It has some addictive traits, sort of like candy crush.

Super simple game that is very fun. Played with my wife with just the basic game, no super powers. She enjoyed not having to think too hard about the super power effects but I'm eager to try with them so I can make some nice chains. My biggest chain was 2, and my largest pop was 5. Eager to beat those scores!

Random as hell! If there were more than just 2 layers of bubbles, the game could (probably!) be more strategic and less prone to complete chaos.
And the theme is just... fluffy and uninspiring.
The ,,take-that" element was a bad design-idea. I don't like it at all.
It's - hey, lets ruin someone else's plan. Just for pure fun. Why not?

RATING: 6
I love video game puzzles like Tetris and Dr. Mario, and more recently I've tried one or two match-3 games, and I love them. This game is a match-3 game slowed down to a turn-based puzzler. Because the speed element is removed, this is a little more of a brain-burner than its video game counterparts. There's also a good deal of trying to harm what your opponent is doing. I like this game, and it's something I would choose to play with the right opponent, but finding someone as interested in this as I am has been difficult.

It does have a solitaire mode, which is all right, but I'd play other solitaire games before this one.

Essayé à Essen 2016
Ca combine Candy Crush et Puzzle Bobble. Deux joueurs, deux planètes (représentée par 5 lignes de 5 bulles chacune) et un ciel (de 2 lignes) qui les sépare. Les bubbles, cinq ou six couleurs) apparaissent sur les deux lignes du milieu, toujours pleine au début d'un tour de joueur. Chaque tour, vous intervertissez deux bulles, puis vous en faites descendre deux sur votre planète (elles descendent en mode puissance 4). Si vous en alignez 3 horizontalement ou verticalement, vous les scorez en les enlevant du plateau et en faisant descendre ce qui reste, et vous activez un petit pouvoir qui va vous filer un avantage immédiat ou pourrir un peu votre adversaire. Le jeu s'arrête quand il n'y a plus de bobbles dans le ciel ou qu'un des joueurs a sa planète pleine. C'est très joli, assez sympa.

This game can be fun, but only if you have luck and "Bubbles" are either in your favor or neutral to you.

My biggest problem with this game is that it gives you illusion of choice but ultimately it is just random and can just screw you by bad bubble draw.

Very smart idea to make Tetris for one or two players with the two player version even having some actual interaction and not just puzzle solving. Special powers are a nice addition which also makes the small building area reasonable. Component quality and art are awesome and overall this catches the Tetris feeling very well.

In diesem reinen 2-Spieler Spiel schiebt man sich Bubbles (runde Plättchen) auf seine Brettseite. Sind 3 gleifarbige in einer Reihe darf diese abräumen (jeweils 1 Punkt) und eine entsprechende Aktion durchführen, die einem weiterhilft oder dem Gegner schadet.
Wer am Ende die meissten Bubblees hat gewinnt.
Ein Spiel, das ich schon lange suche und im Handel nicht gefunden habe. Gefällt mir sehr gut und kann ich mir vorstellen mit meiner Frau zu spielen. -> Haben will!
Der Zufallsfaktor ist gefühlt recht hoch, hat mich aber gar nicht so sehr gestört, da es wirklich flott zu spielen ist.

The artwork on the bubbles is a little odd, but the game is quite fun.  Think of the video game Bejeweled where you're lining up three of a kind to make them disappear in order to score points.  Now instead of a solo game, make it a versus style.  There are two rows of five bubbles each in the middle of the board (a neutral zone considered 'the sky').  On a turn a player swaps two adjacent bubbles in the sky, then drops two adjacent bubbles down onto their side (on the next player's turn, they draw two random bubbles from a bag to replace the two that fell into a player's side).  Connecting three like-colored bubbles in a row on your side eliminates them and frees up space for you.  Each color has a different effect when you connect them.  Some benefit your side while other effects impede your opponent's side.  It's simple to learn, but in later rounds it can get very strategic.

Candy Crush the Boardgame, that describes rather well. And it all works quite well. Score 3 in a row of one colour, then you will get to perform the special bonus action of that colour for some extra tricks. Not bad this one.

For those Candy Crush/ Gem app gamers out there. This is essentially the app game you know and love. I used to play bubble pop on the computer a long while back and I do very much enjoy Candy Crush. Your family and wifey who play those games will certainly enjoy this 2p abstract game. I really did. If I thought Ron would actually play with me, I might have bought it. It is a clever abstract game to try and get 3 or more of a color in a row and you get a bonus action depending on the colors you are popping. You get a point for each pop. Simple and clever and so adorable!!!

RATING: 1
It's nice to see an attempt to implement an app game in a boardgame form - especially as the shift is from 1 player to 2 player game. Saying this, the game felt very much autopilot for me, not being sure what made me win or lose - you can see one or maybe two moves ahead, mostly it's tactical positioning for randomness of the draw. Playing with special powers is kinda, whatever, as 2 of them help you combo and 2 of them hinder the opponent (take-that) and one kinda does both, so it evens out. 
My main problem is that it's kinda solitaire and puzzly, but with limited planning and interaction is mostly interference not unlike the luck of the draw (tactical in nature). I guess it's as much an autopilot game as the computer original(s) and it does look really cute (Fuzzy round creatures, Oog likes!). So, something for siesta or 5 'o clock tea.

Rating down: A definitive meh. A complete whatever. Hey let's push some cardboard bits around. Shrug. (Why not just stare out the window instead, it's autumn, leaves are yellow.)

Online plays at boardgamearena.com

A simple 2-player game in the Bejeweled family, but much simpler and faster than Potion Explosion. Here, player boards are across one another, with space for 10 "bubblees" in the middle. On your turn you can swap 2 adjacent center pieces, then have 2 drop into your play area (assuming there's space for them -- if not, you lose!). If you create a line of 3+ matching colors, add them (and any other matches clustered with them) to your score pile. You also get a special power based on the color scored (swap 2 adjacent pieces in your or your opponent's tableau, send a piece -- yours or from the center -- to your opponent's tableau, or move one of your pieces to your score pile). You can adjust game difficulty by adding some black pieces to your tableau at the beginning of the game (they can only be removed with color powers). 

Fun diversion for quick online play.

RATING: 5.5
[thing=192343][/thing] is a a Candy Crush type of board game - it is simpler than [thing=180974][/thing] and is mostly made for 2 players (but can be played solo). The goal is simple: align three or more bubblees horizontally or vertically. Once aligned, these will leave your play area, score points accordingly to how many of them were taken out, and activates a special power -  just like when completing a potion in [thing=180974][/thing], except that you can't save the use of the power for later. And these can allow room for some nifty plays, and also give some thought about which marker to take. While the game is pretty easy to grasp, there are a little depth to it.

The bubblees stay in an area between the players (the sky). In her turn, the player may change the position of two adjacent (not diagonally) bubblees. Then she must choose two to "drop" and add to her play area. The game ends when there isn't more markers to fill the sky, when the player with the most points will be the winner; or when a player doesn't have more space to add bubblees, then this person immediately loses.

The gameplay of [thing=192343][/thing] is very simple, with plenty of luck in the draw of the markers (at least the player can decide where to add the first, the last one is always a gamble). The interaction comes not only from changing the position of the markers and taking them, but also there are several opportunities of "take that", be by sending makers (from the sky or their own board) or messing with the position of the markers of the other side. Usually this isn't all that harmful, but may irritate those that want to play without interference.

Overall, [thing=192343][/thing] works nicely for what it purposes to be: a quick two player game, with some direct interaction, easy to teach rules and fast to learn. It isn't without flaws (mainly the luck factor and, for some, the attacks), but still it can fit many tables: for family time, lunch time or, even, gaming nights, as a filler. [thing=192343][/thing] is OK, and that is fine.

Bubblee Pop is a wonderful implementation of the traditional tile-matching puzzle game genre made so popular with smart phones, and tablets. This is a heads-up game, and it works very well. I love how you can even adjust the difficulty, and easily handicap a more experienced player.

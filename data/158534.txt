This is an awesome game, and one of my favorites lately.  My only gripe is that the rules could be much better.  But, once the puzzle-of-a-rule-set is put together, it's very fun.

RATING: 8.4
I've seen some lukewarm reactions to this game, but I really think it's fun as a light or Gateway euro. You are playing sets of cards as 'bids' each round, resolving them to fill up a gravedigger's cart which is then moved into one of two sides of a central river. The fun comes in trying to bid your way onto that cart and then occupy high scoring grave plots, but there are a number of little nuances through different grave spaces and Fate cards (like a Vampire hahahaah), and dumping extra coffins in the river. As Marco Arnaudo said in his Youtube review, it's a 'coffin placement' game. Lighthearted artwork, unique theme, simple mechanics, I actually hope they'll add more to this.

RATING: 7
Great game with a fun theme. I really like the ability to dislodge previously played coffins. Too often placement games don't allow for a "redo" to correct an earlier misplay. This allows one to rethink your initial plan and play accordingly.

This game is a lot more fun than I thought it would be. Setting the game up for the first time after buying it on a whim because of a low price point, I thought I would regret my decision. After getting through our first round and playing on subsequent dates I realized the game is a lot of fun, I'm a big fan of Ticket to Ride and this game is akin to that. Your placing dead bodies in plots versus trains on tracks. The added bidding process each round and fate abilities of dumping friends bodies in the river or stealing plots is great. The wooden pieces are great and the packaging is sound. The card art and stock is awesome too. I do appreciate the double-sided board for 2-3 versus 4-5 players. A great game that I got at a great price (19.99). At the $50 price point, I'd be a bit averse but for what you get it's not totally unwarranted.

The game had an interesting theme. I thought the card play, bidding and area control was good. I thought the coffin components were a nice touch but they were very small. I thought the choices when bidding were interesting but could have been better. I think a larger variety of wagons (spaces) could have made for more exciting bids. If you can get this for a clearance price, then I don't think you'll be disappointed.

06-2016: All tarot cards sleeved, great condition. Includes rare canceled Kickstarter Megan's Purple resin player pieces that were purchased from the original game creators.

Game is light and plays quickly (it only lasts a set number of rounds). I liked the artwork and the theme but there wasn't enough game behind that to give it legs. The victory point system is very subjective and a little too random. I feel this game would have benefited from more play-testing (just look at the cards in the instruction booklet and compare them with the final versions). The lack of ways to obtain victory points really limits your choices if you want to win. 

12-2016: adjusted the score to a lower value of 5 after having played The Bloody Inn. It handled a similar morbid subject but also had more game to back up the theme.

Great player interaction is the highlight of this game. There's little in the way of luck but lots of ways to screw over your opponents while trying to get ahead. I could see this being very cutthroat if you had a group of people all experienced in this one. It didn't overstay it's welcome and was a nice change from typical Euros that can often feel like solitaire.

I played this game twice at Origins and once at home. IMO the best new game at the Origins. With only a six page rule book it is easy to learn and easy to teach. Your ability to score points is heavily influenced by the actions of the other players, so you can not just do the exact same strategy every game and expect to win. Onc of the best aspects is players can focus on different avenues to score points and still be competitive with each other in the final score.

Aside from all the great mechanics, the theme of the game really pulls it all together. It manages to take a morbid idea of burying your dead relatives and gives it a whimsical touch. The layout if clean and the artwork beautiful.

Another sign of a good game... as soon as I was done playing, I was ready to play another!

RATING: 3
I gave this a "3" rating.  Not because the game is bad - it isn't.  It gets a "3" because the rulebook is a piece of crap with too many left-open questions.  To make it worse, when I inquired as to some of the concerns we ran into when playing, the guy trying to answer my questions (at Origins) became incredibly beligerant and answered many of my concerns with an answer of "well, it's just common sense".

Um, no.  Poorly written rules cannot be overridden by "common sense".  Such as how to earn/share points with an area-control scoring mechanism resulting in a tie.  Who gets the points?  Are they split?  Shared?  Reduced?  Both get it?  It's not in the rule book, and the explainer insisted that it was (no, really, go look for it).

The iconography is also for crap, since it isn't consistent.  Words/instructions would have been best placed on the card, rather than an icon, especially when some cards have icons and some don't, even though they do the exact same thing!

Overall, I hate this game because the rule book was poorly written, and I don't think anyone playtested it.  And using "common sense" is not a proper way to determine the outcome of any contest involving area control, as there are just too many ways in which such a mechanism can be utilized.

Stay away from this game!

RATING: 8
After several plays, I am really enjoying this game, light as it is. That said, it does seem to play a bit too fast. Right when our group seems to really get into the "screw you" factor of the fate cards and get highly competitive over grave spaces, the eighth cart comes out and we are suddenly in a rush to slip in a few more burials. By the time that eighth cart appears, we are usually running low on coffins but have yet to run out in a game of 3 players. Compared to the size of the fate and treasure decks, relatively few of the cards ever come out in a single game. I suppose this offers a more random experience between games. Looking forward to trying this one with 4-5 players. Great followup game after playing Gloom.
$25 from B&N clearance.

The thematic dressing doesn't quite cover the title's very abstract roots, and it is such a shame the score tracker included is a 'Crest' piece rather than the planned Gravestone (meaning the icons re upside down, most annoyingly), but... an interesting tactical bidding. bluffing, area control, AND set collection game - with plenty of ways to score points.

RATING: 7
The graveyard spaces had an interesting variety to them that I liked. We weren't able to quite finish our game, so I don't have the benefit of a full play-through, but overall I found this a pleasant surprise: I was expecting a sub-par game with an amusing theme, and found both interesting getting-into-other-players'-heads and decisions around grave-claiming. While you're mostly doing the same thing round after round, it seems like the player-driven endgame would result in a "use 'em before endgame" crescendo of special-ability card play near the end; our last round certain felt climactic that way, like everyone was pulling out the stops.

One person in our game seemed faintly annoyed that graves seemed to have a "base" value of 4 when the variety between most graves is only a couple points, but it seems pretty clear to me that's just to make burying your relatives at all better than letting them get dumped in the river.

(Egads, what a sentence to write.)

I enjoyed my first play of this game.  It had a good mechanic and was easy to learn.  It will be a good game to play occasionally.  It played good with 5 players.  It has 2 sides to the board, for 2-3 players and for 4-5 players, which should let it scale nicely.  It was a relatively quick game, easily less than an hour to be taught the rules and play.
I have played a few times and still enjoy the game.  Played good with 3 players.

A game that combines bidding with worker placement, with a variable number of potential workers (coffins) placed each round, and a limit on which area you can place them.

Overall this is fairly middling stuff, with a rulebook that could use some love, though it does have an original (and amusing) theme and characters, I'll give it that.

Played a couple times at BGDG with designer Aaron and publisher Max, both really good guys.  Interesting combination of elements in this game- the board play reminiscent of Revolution, the card play and hand management element, and the "action allotment prediction" (if you will) which is maybe similar to the market mechanic in Automobile.  I think it was this last part which made the game only moderately enjoyable for me, as that same issue ended up killing Automobile for me.  Overall, this is a very solid, somewhat simplistic game with a ghoulishly fun theme.  I expect most players will rate this higher than myself.

Played it twice at Origins. It was okay.

The Theme is great. Lots of bonus points here. The coffin tokens are high quality and very cool. The artwork on the board and cards is likewise very colorful, gloomy, and nice, and very evocative of the theme.

The mechanics and balance are pretty good, although after watching and playing several times, I think that the best strategies are always going to involve doing whatever it takes to get a lot of fate cards and gem (treasure) cards.  I don't think there's as much room for changing play styles as there is in Stone Age, for example.

As someone else has pointed out, the icons on the cards aren't helpful, especially for new players. This is my number one complaint. The icons on the fate cards are too small, and there are too many of them, making it kind of tedious to look them up the first few times you play. They should be a little bigger, and they should go ahead and write the text explaining what the card does on the very bottom of the card.

Overall, it was a pretty fun game, and I would play it again.

07-01-2015 - Don't know what all the fuss is about with this game.  It was a huge hit at DTC but I don't see why.  Mostly just worker placement (coffin placement actually), but not in the way you think.  You don't get cool actions for placing coffins, you're just trying to claim end-of-game points.  And people can "take that" you and move your coffin to lower point areas.  There are cards you play to determine turn order, take actions, some set collection, but blah blah blah.  I don't know, there are just other games to play.  5 and I might be generous with that.

This is kind of a neat title with an unusual theme of putting dead folks in the ground. It's not quite as dark as it seems as it has kind of a lighthearted feel to it. There are opportunities to give your opponents some trouble as you try to get your corpses in the best plots and keep them out of the river. The little coffin pieces are pretty cool.

I saw this at BGG CON 2014 originally, and even though I liked the theme (twisted, I know), I wasn't sure about the gameplay. I'm happy to report that Bring Out Yer Dead is a very fun game. That said, there's really not a lot going on in this one. You basically bid for grave sites, assign your dead into various graves, and use special cards to enhance effects/get more points. That's it. For what is is though, it's a lot of fun.

Straightforward take that card game with amusing, albeit morbid, theme.  Manage your hand and stock of coffins and try to grab the best plots and keep your opponents out and dump them in the river.  Would play again with the family but not really hardcore gamer fare.

Wow, this game has not aged well. I really enjoyed this when I first played it, but ended up trading it away with the hopes of getting it back if I could get it for less than $30. That ended up happening, but there is very little in the way of decision making in this game. It's a quasi-bidding game where you're each revealing cards to do certain actions. It works well enough, but I feel like the game is a little flat. Plus the component quality and stuff you get in the box does NOT match the price point. This was just really disappointing to see a game I used to like now be almost laughably bad. Along with the fact that the theme doesn't match the target audience in terms of complexity, Bring Out Yer Dead is just a clear miss of a game.

A quote from Monty Python's Holy Grail. This one is a bit morbid. The artwork is pretty indicitive of this, but the game is easy to play and fun.

The game board is simply divided into a number of grave plot areas.
Each turn a cart comes around to collect coffins, but there's only so much space.
Each player chooses a coffin card to play from their hand and they will all be revealed simultaneously.
In turn order each player loads their coffin on to the cart. If it doesn't fit it gets thrown in the river.

Coffins on the cart are then placed in any grave on one side of the river. Each grave site has a certain amount of points.
Some spots are more lucrative places to grab over others.

Players count up their points and the most points win.

We received a demo of this game at DiceTowerCon 2015 which led us to immediately purchase it.  I can see playing this multiple times with gamers and non-gamers alike.  The theme is wonderful, cartoony macabre.   

I agree with the negative comments on the rule book.  In two out of three games we had ties in the mausoleum spaces and had to make up our own rule. 

One concern was that the bottom half of the box had a split corner with no evidence of damage to the top/corner which leads me to believe that this happened during manufacturing/packaging.

This is a hand management game where each player plays the role of a family member whose family has suffered an astonishingly large number of causalities and they are trying to get all of their deceased loved ones in the best graves.

Each round the starting player will decide which half of the graveyard will be used.  Then players each play 3 cards in secret.  Each player has an identical hand of starting cards and can also collect new ones throughout the game.  The new cards are one-time use however while the starting cards can be re-used.  Each card has a number on it dictating when that card takes effect.  The cards place coffins on a cart, manipulate coffins already on the board, and also grant victory points.  After all the cards have been played the coffins on the cart are placed in empty graves and any that didn't make it onto the cart are tossed into the river (losing that player points at game end).

The gameplay is reasonably simple, it's just a matter of hand management and choosing the best time to play certain cards for the greatest overall benefit.  I can see how the theme can be a little off-putting.  It's morbid and honestly, doesn't make a ton of sense.  I do wish there was more variety to the cards you can acquire.  There's only a handful of different options so I'm not sure how long of a life this game has (no pun intended).

The artwork is pretty nice and the little coffins in each player color are well-done but a board, coffins, and cards are all that is in this game.  The box is mostly air.  All the more reason to give us more cards!

It's a fine and pretty accessible game.  Not the best hand management game I've ever played but it plays a lot quicker than most of the others.

Cool theme, almost great game but the two player game is no good, and the rules are atrocious to the point where we never could figure out what some of the cards actually do.

Ok worker placement type of game. Gets pretty chaotic. Too chaotic for my liking. Fun but not great.

Some set collection, some competition over majorities, and guessing what cards your opponents will play. There are plenty of better games available.

Amusing game with an easy premise and a great theme. A few different ways to score points that keep us guessing, and when someone plays the card that switches the side of the river, everyone goes CRAZY mad.  Excellent.

A fun game in a surprising setting/theme. But pleasantly surprised on the fun I have in both plays so far.

Not a terrible game but after playing a number of times it has run its course.

Nothing wrong with the game itself- I just wasn't a fan. Looking to trade. All parts of the game are intact. There are a few small scuff marks on the sides.

Fast and light card / placement game. Rules are very simple and can be learned and taught in a short span of time. Fun when in the mood for a something a little more simplistic.

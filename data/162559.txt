Elves seem to be the least useful faction as they help everyone, but not themselves all that much.  Dwarves seem incredibly over powered due to the large power bonuses from treasure.  Halfings get lots of extra minion plays, but balance out when you run out of minions.  Orcs are very big and strong with very few effects.  Clerics recycle the graveyard a lot, by returning cards to hand or shuffling them back into the deck.  Warriors kill lots of things and give power bonuses.  Thieves steal treasure and get boosts for having lots of treasures.  Wizards discard lots of cards to perform different effects, like getting extra actions, minion plays, minion destruction.  Like the monsters and treasure additions.

I hate munchkin, but this is a great expansion for smashup.  It is really Smash Up: High fantasy. The slight drawback is that it is a little challenging to play with the other expansions and decide how many location that reference monsters you should be playing with, etc...  This expansion does especially bad when you just mix it all together.

Mainly I got this to Smash Up the fantasy factions with my pre-existing collection. I imagine a Dwarf/Kitten army is in my near future. But it's neat that the bases in this one spawn Monsters, and that there are additional Treasure cards, so the mechanics are ever so slightly different than the previous expansions yet easy to combine.

Not one of the best Smash Up expansions but by no means a weak addition to my Geeky Box. As long as you actually use the bases that implement monsters the new races and classes can be entertaining. This might even be a nice gateway into the other expansions for someone who really love the "Take That" appeal of Munchkin but wants to branch out a bit.

Definitely a unique expansion that has challenges mixing with the others. There are many forum posts about this, so I won't discuss in detail. In summary, the bases bring monsters (special minions) which complicate the game. Killing the monsters or scoring a base that they're on grants treasures, which add chaos and surprises to the game. Together, these complications and chaos make Smash Up a longer and less strategic game. My friend generally prefer to avoid these factions, although sometimes we all jump in head first and play entirely with Munchkin factions.

RATING: N/A
So far I've played one game with only Munchkin races.  That took too long.  The monsters and treasures are fun, but it just adds too much complexity for this level of strategy.  I will try it with the Munchkin races mixed in with the other sets.  

For the record, I thought the original Munchkin game was hilarious - for 15 minutes.  I will never play it again, but I might browse the cards.

I have much higher expectations from Munchkin Smash Up.  :-)

Interesting spin on smash up. There is a separate treasure deck that all players have access to, and monsters guard each of the locations you battle over. 

It works fairly well and does have the munchkin theme and the smashup gameplay.

More factions!

At first, I was worried about how they were going to implement a Munchkin themed expansion into Smash Up. I mean, don't get me wrong — I like Munchkin — but the theme doesn't improve upon every game.

This time, however, the theme is a solid hit!

I really enjoy this expansion, but it adds a lot of complexity and requires a good system for keeping track of base power and changing breakpoints, which can be annoying if you haven't developed a system.  I would recommend this expansion to players who have played the standard game A LOT and want to add a new element to spice things up.

I'm more tolerant of Munchkin than a lot of users on this site (it allowed me to satisfy my roleplaying-related urges in a time where I couldn't get a real group together) but this is a crossover I didn't need.

Then again I assume this would actually be a very well-selling product.

Munchkin and Smash Up fans unite! This game brings the fun characters and artwork from munchkin into the foray of Smash Up. Expansion introduces treasures and monsters into gameplay which only takes a game to pickup and fully understand.  This expansion is also capable of being a standalone game, it has all the components within for doing just that.  The factions do seem to have a bit of a leg-up on previous factions but it really just comes down to how savvy you are with your other favorite factions when playing against them. A bit over powered they might be, but if you know what you're doing not a problem whatsover.

Regardless of how you feel about Munchkin (and I know there are strong feelings out there)  Smash Up is a very fun game.  The characters and iconography of the Steve Jackson Game are utilized well in the game and the additions of Monsters and Treasure to the game add a little bit of complexity (and at times a fair bit of math) but also can add to the fun of the overall experience.   
MY wife and I have never played Munchkin, but the SMASH UP: Munchkin was an enjoyable experience and we look forward to  blending this with the already diverse amount of factions in the Smash Up library.

Plays logged under Smash-Up the main game - Monster cards adds more maths to the game which can sometimes be hard to keep track of, needs a better method to keep track of scores. Can also be a little prone to AP, but the game does offer a lot of replayability and a couple of nice combo's to explore.

(After two plays) I actually prefer this to normal Smash Up.  I was surprised to find it an improvement over Munchkin (not surprising) and over normal Smash Up (surprising).
I think we will try one faction from this version and one from normal Munchkin to simplify a bit.  This version requires a good amount more reading and pondering over a turn -- so more of a combo may be better.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The "shufflebuilding" game Smash Up starts with a simple premise: Take the twenty-card decks of two factions, shuffle them into a forty-card deck, then compete to smash more Bases than your opponents! Each faction brings a different powers and sometimes different game mechanisms into play, so every combination of factions brings a unique play experience.

During play, Base cards (each with their own difficulties and abilities) are in play. You attempt to have the most power on the Base from your minions when the Base is smashed because when that happens each player in first, second and third place scores points.

Smash Up: Munchkin is a Munchkin-themed version of Smash Up. There are eight factions; Clerics, Halflings, Orcs, Warriors, Elves, Thieves, Dwarves and Mages.

This expansion adds complexity to a game that does not need it, in my opinion, also prolonging game length very much. Furthermore it is a very random complexity, so quite useless for its own; tons of cards in hand and tons of cumulative effects is not the way the game should go - always in my opinion.
For sure the weaker expansion/stand alone right now.

I also dislike the Elves mechanics and Clerics are a bit too weak. I applied some tweaks to both these factions to rebalance them.

Finally hit the threshold of "not worth the time and effort" with this one.  The Cthulhu expansion walked that line but managed to keep it all together and is a fun iteration.

All the beauty of the orginal and many worthy expansions (and I have them all and have played them all extensively) is thrown out the window with this one.  

Bloated, time consuming turns, down timey - everything the original wasn't.  Seriously, if my very experienced play group and I have to spend more than 5 seconds during mid-game every time we want to see if a base will break on the next played minion then there's something wrong.  Monsters are a fun idea but are that one-layer-too-many.

Mixed with other expansions the game suddenly lengthens by at least 10 minutes and for the first time you'll sit there looking at the other three people wondering why it's taking so long for them to play.  Monsters, treasures... sheesh, and I dare you to mix it with the Cthulhu expansion and get a game in less than 30 minutes long even with 4 experienced players.

As a stand alone expansion I can only assume its 5+ rating is fueled by nostalgia for Munchkin.  Sure, if you love Munchkin, enjoy!  But despite a bit of cleverness in its conception this one is at best a mess if you take it solely on it's own contributions (or lack thereof) to the Smash Up franchise.

Why we culled it: It left with the base game. See my more comprehensive comments on the base game entry for details. In general, all of the expansions are fairly similar from the standpoint that if they add a trope that excites you, it is probably worth adding to your collection if you're interested. Mechanically, they do differ and add new things, but they do a good job trying to keep it thematic, so you aren't missing much if the theme of an expansion doesn't grab you.

Smash Up Munchkin does exactly what it sets out to do. It adds a dash of Munchkin flavor done up Smash Up style. If Munchkin appealed to me in any way, that might have been a positive. As it is, I don't really love Smash Up and I detest Munchkin. So this didn't work for me at all.

Basically, this adds monsters and treasure to the base game and you can play races and classes from the Munchkin universe. The monsters and treasures pretty much just make an already long game more complicated. They ended up making Smash Up decidedly worse for me.

And I don't know if it was that Elves and Theives didn't work well together, or if I wasn't drawing the right cards, or if I just completely don't know how to play this game, but I just felt like nothing worked in my hand in this game. But honestly, I didn't really care that much.

This was a fairly miserable experience for me. There was no part of this game that was enjoyable to me. Almost immediately I was just waiting for the game to end. The group graciously decided to call the game at 10 points instead of the standard 15.

Great on it's own, but doesn't work well if you mix it with the other smash up expansions and the monsters turn into an annoyance without the munchkins. In addition some of the Munchkin factions are very weak without the monster bases/treasure deck. This expansion didn't have to exist honestly...still there are a few good factions that work well. Mages are my favorite faction.

The best Smash Up expansion. The addition of the added monsters and treasures really up the replay value.  If you are going to buy one stand alone expansion box to play as a core, this is it.  Doesn't work as well as with the base set.

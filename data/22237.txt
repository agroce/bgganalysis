RATING: 6
Very cool metagame above the basic mechanics. Being the sherriff is really fun - stare down your opponents; ask them questions to try and make them nervous; perhaps even trip them up and get them to say the wrong thing.

The only thing that would make this better is if the suitcases (which are pretty cool metal tins) actually had little handles, and you could then play the game by having the smugglers standing in a line and walking by. I suppose you could still do this.

Add one if you have the right group (accents, smack talk, etc.).  Good bluffing game.  The endgame is almost a little too mathy.  I recommend playing without it for your first game.  Just reading about it put me off from playing it for six months!

Two people asked if Hart an der Grenze is close to Contraband. In fact, the games are quite different. I have never played Contraband, but I read a review. Contraband seems a version of Liar Dice with no dice. The mechanics of Hart an der Grenze are quite different. I think that the apparent similarity is due to the theme and to the fact that both are bluff games, but from what I read, it ends there.

(1 play, 5 players) Really wanted to like this one more, because the theme is neat and it looks like fun.  But, well... there was kinda no game here.  And by about halfway through, we all figured that out on our own.  Now, maybe it was group-think on our parts, but why wouldn't you just put all 5 cards into your suitcase?  Especially with 5 players, where the likelihood of being inspected is basically 25% (plus maybe those extra tokens).  And even if you get caught, you just bribe, which the Sheriff is gonna take, because otherwise s/he gets nothing, too.  Yawn.  Even worse, with 5 players doing this, we ran out of cards before the end.  I can't even imagine playing this with 6 players - even less of a chance to get caught, even more of chance to run out of cards.  Very disappointing.

Fun little bluffing game. The suitcases are wonderful chrome, but sort of unnecessary. There is quite a bit of strategy in this as you try to remember what cards have been played and what everyone declared each round. I really want to give this one a second go around! 2nd play was with 3. Not as much fun with only 3. I would guess the sweet spot for this is 5 players.

The best part of the game are the bits. A fun idea for a game, but in practice the game sort of broke.  Once everyone figured out that they could stuff their whole hand into their suitcases and get away with it most of the time, the deck ran out prematurely. 

Anyway, I think the description of this as a "gamer's party game" is correct.  It's fun with the right crowd, it's random, and it's pretty. Might be good for playing about once a year.

RATING: 6
I liked how it played and definitely had fun.  I wish there was some practical limitation on how much a player can smuggle at once.  I smuggled somewhat cautiously and was occasionally caught, not bad, but I had the worst score.  Others were stuffing their suitcases, so when I was picked by the sheriff, they made an absolute [i]killing[/i].  It'd be better, in my opinion, if such swings weren't as dramatic.

Hart an der Grenze is a fun activity with the right crowd, but I've never thought the bluff/double bluff mechanism made for much of a game.  Throw some crap in your suitcase and hope the current sheriff doesn't bust you if you put any illegals in there.  The fun of this game is all about the joking around with other players throughout the game, but the game itself isn't much of anything.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great party game. Lots of room for humor/roleplaying. I think people naturally take to the theme and being in this position of power in such a fun way. It's also funny to play a bluffing game in which EVERYONE is likely to be lying but you can only call one person out on their shit.

The little suitcases are awesome. It seems like it would be an easy game to get nongamers in on if you show them the suitcases and explain the theme. Only issue is that it can wear a little thin if played too often (probably due to its length, which is a little longer than similar games) - I like to think of it as a "limited frequency, but not limited lifespan" kind of game.

Update: It's worth saying that this is one of the party games that has REALLY stuck with our group over the years. We play it a couple times a year and always get a kick out of it and get really into the roleplay. Not sure what magic is at work here, but there's definitely something!

Update the Second: I'm so happy that this came out in English as Sheriff of Nottingham and that it's gotten so much love! I don't think I'll bother "upgrading" as I prefer this theme and am too enamored with my little suitcases, but I'd be curious to play the new one and see the difference.

RATING: 6
Filler game.  Players try to smuggle goods in their suitcases.  You put things in it, and then declare what's in there to the sheriff for the round.  If the sheriff decides to search your case, you better have what you said you had or else you'll need to bribe the sheriff or pay a fine.  On the other hand, if you declared honestly, you get paid for your trouble by the bank.  A fun (if a little bit too long) bluffing game that goes for about 45 minutes.  It made me nervous, and I always like games when they make me nervous.  It bothered me, though, that they made these fun suitcase components, but then they tell you to make these different piles of cards, beside your suitcase and under your suitcase.  It's a little tricky to figure out which pile is which when you pick up your suitcase.  A small point, but it is annoying.  I doubt I'd play with more than 4.

This one seems like it should have been more fun than it was. The investment at the end of the game for double the value is a bit weird. Also, at least in a 5p game, it was too easy to sneak across a full suitcase with little risk. The components are nice...especially the metal suitcase tins. I'd play again, and maybe the game would shine better with 4p.

RATING: 1
I think that a game should always make the player “care” to some degree what is happening in it- HART AN DER GRENZ is one of those games where in playing it I really couldn’t have cared less about anything that was happening. I didn’t care if my bag got searched, I didn’t care if I successfully smuggled out a cigar in a bag full of sombreros. I mean come on, the theme of the game is customs declarations and searches! Talk about excitement! HDG (hereafter referred to as “That Mexican Suitcase Game”) is an example of Euro design at its absolute worst, a pointless exercise in low-stakes bluffing that fails to deliver as a game- it’s nothing more than an activity for 5-6 people to waste 
time and use “funny” Spanish accents. Maybe that’s OK with you, but I’d rather play something I cared about and where I at least feel something’s at stake if only in the context of the game. The bluffing is pointless because there is no sense of tension or stress, the “negotiation” boils down to handing someone money so they won’t search your suitcase (which 
pretty much indicts you as having illegal goods), and the only mechanic that approaches interesting is how rifling through a bag that contains exactly what its owner declared gets them compensation, encouraging the customs agent player to choose wisely. The dimestore tin suitcases, although cute, are completely superfluous and make a game that could have been a $12 card game an expensive, big-box game. Completely, utterly pointless but undoubtedly coast by as a popular mid-range Euro based on the novelty of the suitcases alone.

2007-07: acquired in the Rick Thornquist Great Games Sell-off.  First play was good.  Pat noted that it was interesting that even though I was inspected more than anyone else, I won.  That, actually, is a good thing.  No, not the fact that I won, but rather good for the gameplay.  My fear was that should someone prove to be a popular target for the sheriff's inspections, their chances of winning would invariably sink, but this wasn't the case - at least in this particular game.  Still, bluffing games are not my favourite genre (otherwise I would have rated it higher) and this one needs a minimum of four players to be at it's best, so it won't get played at home.  I might end up trading this game away.
2008-02 update: traded this away for "Tycoon"

Players are attempting to smuggle goods across the Mexican border.  Each turn, one player takes the role of the sheriff, while the other players stuff up to five cards into their cute tin suitcases.  They each then "declare" how many of what type of good are in their case.  The sheriff can then search a player's case, which can lead to bribes, duty fines, or recompense for defamation!  Any goods not found are stuffed away to be sold at the end of the round (or end of the game for potentially double the profit...or nothing!).  Fun game, stunning pieces - the tin cases are fantastic, but not really needed - still it adds to the atmosphere.  A clever game of bluff, card counting, and maths disguised as a party game.  Great crossover potential for non-gamers too.  Strongly reminiscent of Contraband, which I played a ton of as a kid, but enough differences to make it it's own beast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Lavish Kosmos production for a good, fun group game. You take turns being the sheriff and inspecting one of the suitcases, or accept a bribe to leave it shut. Goods that make it over the border are sold for cash, but contraband and undeclared goods mean you have to pay a fine. A fun group game, but nothing earth-shattering here except the awesome components.

Very funny little party game; its basically all about bluffing and pretending.
Nicely overproduced -the suitcases are totally superflous, but pretty.
Not short for its depth, but never boring.
The distribution of the cards is random, so there is a luck factor there (since all the merchandises don´t have the same value); but I´m not sure it´s a problem for such a game...

Hart an der Grenze is a stupid game of bluffing and luck that, while overproduced and massively overpriced, delivers in silly fun and fits of laughter.  For such a simple game it can be tough to teach the rules (especially for end of game scoring), but it succeeds in the realms of wit and charm.  I like the special ability tokens as they alleviate the motony of the otherwise straightforward gameplay. I would suggest that players do not overlook the power of bribery though, as this is half the game alone.

The suitcase tins of this game add so much charm and feel to the game and make it all the more fun to play.

This gamed is banned in Brazil! ... a little silly .. but I guess a game about smuggling contraband and bribing border guards wasn't welcome in Brazil.

Remade as "Robin Hood" ... but trust me ... you want the original.

There is some fun in it, but you need a proper company.  I was not excited in general, but there were some thriling moments: hard negotiations with both sides bluffing, lying, changing offers dramatically etc.

Final scoring is insanely random and basically makes it a non-competitive game.

Single 6 player game only.

Fun, light game of bluffing and guesswork based on smuggling theme. Very reminiscent of old 1960s Pepys game Contraband. Attractive components, especially the metal suitcases - although I do like Contraband's 1960s artwork.

Not actually a lot of game here; decisions are limited to choosing when to smuggle and when to play it straight, and as the sheriff deciding whose bag to open. In all but two turns the sherriff accepted a bribe when we played, meaning searches were essentially a case of agreeing a bribe value. It's fun, but winning is essentially a case of getting lucky.

Docked a point for overstaying its welcome (felt like a good 30-45 minute game, but went on for well over an hour), plus we ran out of cards on the final turn.

A nice take on smuggling games... and in our first game we took it to the limit.  We actually ran out of cards in the final round.  The number of goods is limited so there doesn't seem to be enough interaction and we found that the rewards and penalties are much too low.

A light filler which should probably see more play at our club... I rate it a 7.

Fun because the idea is unique.  I can see how the more people get into playing their role, the more entertaining the game can be.  Most of the faults I had read about this game I found true - mainly that the gameplay is repetitive and lasts a little too long.  Ultimately you are held hostage by the cards you are dealt - if you always get legal goods it's hard to make money.  But the overproduced bits and humorous theme go a long way and make for an enjoyable game.  Not one you'd want to play every session, but every once in a while it's good to pull out for some laughs.

Nice little bluffing game. Simple enough for non-gamers except for the confusing endgame. There's a nice bit of keeping-a-straight-face while secretly carrying 4 loads of tequila across the border.

Components are overdone, but very nice and certainly helps set the mood for the games.

"Stop right there!  I'm the customs sheriff and I want to know what you've got in that baggage of yours."  It's a game of bluffing and lousy accents.  The best aspect of the game is the table talk used by everyone in determining who (if anyone) is bluffing and who isn't.  This game depends strongly on who you play with.

Smuggling, heheheh, now that is a game to me!  Lie to the sherrif(as if everyone has already...) or speak the truth, and make your way across the border!

[b]Great components and theme, but gameplay is lukewarm. You can't smuggle high-value goods if you never draw them. Not much info to base inspections on.

Gorgeous suitcases!  Why did they give us paper money though?  The game is best with 4 players.  Three is a little tight, and more than four players means that everyone has a pretty good chance of smuggling way too much through.  Great when played in Southern California, where most of us have experience, er, crossing the border.

RATING: 6
Better than the game it's based on - Contraband.  But still, it's just a little long.  Also, I think there's a problem with the role of sheriff.  It's tough to get anything for being the sheriff - you only gain from it if someone bribes you, and when accused by the sheriff, it's often just as good to just buck up and pay the fine.  You lose money either way, but when paying a bribe you also give money to an opponent.  So you lowball the bribe, and if the sheriff doesn't take it he gets nothing, and you just pay the bank a little more than what you would've paid the sheriff anyway.  Stick to your guns a couple of times and the sheriff either refuses any of your bribes or starts taking your lowball bribes.  Then being the sheriff doesn't help you at all as you're going to gain almost nothing, which means people stop taking being the sheriff seriously, and then it just all boils down to who gets dealt the best cards.  I played the whole game and saw an idol card only once, and guess what?  I lost.  The person who saw the most idol cards won.  Shocking!

RATING: 7
In this bluffing game you have to sneak legal and illegal goods across the border.  A player plays the customs inspector and everyone else declares their goods they are bringing across.  The inspector can elect to let them pass or can inspect their suitcases. 

If they are honest and they get inspected, they score points, if they are dishonest they score the points as long as they don't get inspected.

The trick is trying to detect who's pulling a fast one.  The major gimmick of the game is the suitcases which are altoid like tins painted like suitcases that you put your 'goods' in.

TRY July/07: what a hoot!  You would not want to play this every week, but it's simple & good fun.

Looks like the English translation for "# of cards" declaration should state that no lying allowed for that.  You can lie about what the goods are, at risk of inspection, of course.

With 6 players, we ran out of cards.  Using the proper declaration above MAY have avoided that.  However, we also figured that you could just play the whole 6-player game with 4 cards in everyone's hand, and you'd be fine too.

Fun game, but you have to play this with the right people - it is a mix of a card game with a lot of bluffing and strategy mixed in. I'll be honest, if the group you are playing with is mostly straight-laced just wants to play strategy or co-op games and likes to analyze game-play, it's going to be the worst game ever. If you have a ligther group, that's willing to try new things or likes to gamble and talk with stupid accents and stare one another down occasionally to see who starts laughing first, then they'll love this game. It's just a fun light-hearted game - overthinking this will kill all the joy and if you don't like to bluff people, then the game just won't work for you. I like it and think it's fun, win or lose, but only with the right group.

A great older game about bluffing, bribery and all-out fun.

I might actually prefer this game to its successor "Sheriff of Nottingham" for its simplicity and for its clever twist on set collection and end-game scoring. In this game there is no discarding of cards, which solves the issue with the players who never lie in Sheriff of Nottingham. In this game you HAVE TO move contraband or your hand gets clogged with it. Which is fine, because the sheriff can normally check just one suitcase per turn.

The metal suitcases are simply gorgeous! :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Nice components the tins painted as suitcases are cute (but unnecessary).
Extremely random - mostly depends on the luck of the draw. Yes it is a bluffing game, you have to ham it up as the inspector. the special game action (confiscate or second inspection) do add a bit of interest. 

Too long for what it is - a party game, by the last round the joke wears thin.

Another version of the 1950 game Contraband with a whimsical border smuggling theme. Nice little tin suitcases are provided to store your loot. A few deals are struck, lots of risk taking, bluffing and guessing and not much else. Repeat the same thing over several rounds and you end up with a winner. It's okay, but not a game I feel the inclination to keep bringing to the table. More of a social experience with disbelief at what players will try and get past you with an innocent look on their faces.

This is a masterfully done party game.  For those that like Werewolf and other social bluffing environments this is a blast.  If you want a deep game here, you just aren't going to have fun.  This is really all about acting out the parts.  That said there is enough game here to make this other than just an excercise, but really there is a significant chaos factor in that you may get picked when you are carrying contraband or you may not when you are honest.  Regardless, with the right crowd this is a belly buster, with the wrong crowd this would be a serious bore.

I do have some critisisms, the game is perhaps a little too long for what it is, with five players this should only go at a maximum three rounds (and even then it may wear thin).  Also, while I appreciate the high quality components, Hart an der Grenze just shouldn't be a big box game.  This should have been much more portable, with a much lower price point (as it probably won't get played more than twice a year).

A light game of bluffing, set collection, and negotiation. The deck of cards has 3 legal goods (maracas, jugs and sombreros) and 3 illegal ones (totems, whisky and cigars). Players get a hand of 5 cards. 1 person is the sherriff, and everyone else is trying to bring goods from Mexico to the US: put 1-5 cards in the suitcase; then, in turn, declare what you've got. Sherriff can search 1 person's suitcase: any illegal goods are lost, but if all goods are legal then the player gets a payoff. Once a target has been chosen, that target player may attempt to bribe the Sherriff to NOT look in their suitcase. Draw back up to 5 cards at the end of the round, and next player becomes Sherriff. At end of the round (everyone sherriff x 1-2, depending on #players), players can set aside 3 of the cards from this round. Repeat x 3. Then, compare all cards set aside; some of these in each type (depends on # players) will be sold for double value. Most money at end of game wins!Everyone else seems to like the game - what's not to like about taking with a funny accent? Well, not me. I don't like the bluffing, or the luck of the draw, or the negotiating over bribes.

Almost falls into the party game category and reminds me in some ways of Cash and Guns.

In this game you get to pretend to be a Mexican border guard and guess which player is lying about the cards he or she has placed in a little suitcase.  The little suitcases are supplied with the game and are, on a scale of fabulous to disgusting, somewhere right around "nifty."  Meanwhile the other players are trying *not* to be the one you guess while they have contraband cards representing tequila and Aztec artifacts and such in the suitcase instead of the legal cards like sombreros and maracas.  So it's a game of trying not to look suspicious so the border guard won't guess you -- or of trying *to* look suspicious so that people will think you're faking -- or of trying not to look suspicious so that people will remember the last time when you *did* look suspicious and were faking -- or -- well, you get the idea.  You have a load of guesswork and choosing your targets and it's hardly the most strategic game in the room, but there's every possibility (even in a large room) that it will be the most *hilarious* game in the room.  And there's a lot to be said for that!  Best played, I would have to expect, with 5 or 6 players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
[Kosmos 'Hart an der Grenze' 2006 edition] {Smuggling, beers&pretzels, gateway; bluffing, set-collection, secret-goal; optimal 5-6p} I believe it's inspired by Contraband. It is a fun and thematic party game. It's undoubtedly more attractive than Contraband. Besides, I find it's more streamlined and interactive than Contraband. Therefore, it's substantially different than Contraband.

Not all players like lying games; and the repeating lying round may be tedious. Therefore, it's only good to get it on the table with a correct mood and beers.

Basically, it's a card game and it's clearly over-produced and over-priced. It'd be wonderful if the Sheriff badge is made of metal. It's a pity that it doesn't come with English rules.

[Rule] I usually make it mandatory that a sheriff must challenge a player (rather than the optional action in the rule).  This would increase information exchange at early rounds.  If every sheriff refuses to challenge, the game will break.

[Special cases] The draw pile would be depleted before game end. I would just shuffle all discards and form a draw pile, although it would impact the card distribution.

This is a really funny game of trying to smuggle illegal goods into the US from Mexico. Everybody gets a turn at being the border patrol where you can search the other players' suitcases.

Awsomely strategic game? No. Bits could be made cheaper? Yes. A lot of fun to play? Hell Yeah!

The only problem I have is the double payout at the end. All the illegal goods are saved and (in our game) one person stores one good in large quantities. Everyone seems to try to corner a single market and then throw in a few cards from something else. The bonus for cornering a market increases as you go to the more expensive items. If someone isn't getting illegal goods during a round (likely) then they're losing points in more ways than one. If you change it to a +3 or +4 bonus, then you might see an even spread of goods between players.

One of those games, like Mama Mia, that players seem to instinctively know must be played speaking in bad accents to enjoy. To an even greater extent than most bluffing/negotiation games, this one really thrives or fails based on the mood of the group playing.

Hart an der Grenze will forever be condemned to rarity and holy grail status, but not because there's an amazing game in the box.  It's a pleasant party game with some bluffing and an ideal theme.  Nothing more.

This game is a lot of fun with either gamers or a social group. We've gotten some good laughs with this.

RATING: 6.5
My daughter and several of my friends really enjoy this game - and there's a lot to like:  it's fun haggling with the border guard, trying to bluff and sneak your contraband across; as the sheriff, busting a second person or seizing their goods makes for a fun guessing game; and finally, the bits really add to the game (the metal suitcases are absolutely fantastic).  At it's best, the game has some fun bluffing and a lot of laughs.

Somehow, though, I've passed on playing it the last few times it's come out because it just doesn't seem like it's going to be that fun.  Maybe I just need to sneak a little of that tequila for myself, and the rest will work itself out.

There do seem to be some broken strategies, though.  What if everyone just smuggled their whole hand every turn?  The sheriff can't bust everyone.  It feels like there needs to be some kind of rules tweak to prevent this kind of group play.  Or maybe I'm trying to squeeze too much game into the box.

Fun game. Definitely has some strategy, but light enough to play with non-gamer types.

Pretty fun little bluffing game. It's tricky, and I'm an awful bluffer, but I liked it a lot.

Pretty much a silly game about smuggling contraband out of Mexico. How is it that this game doesn't make those lists of "controversial" games? I don't know but man it's hillarious IF you play with a crowd who are playing in the spirit of the game. I love this one. I never turn down a chance to play it. Now that I own a copy I am so excited!!!

This one took way too long for what it was.  It's really just a pretty simple bluffing game, but playing all 18 turns (when you have 6 players and go around 3 times) seemed to take forever.  There wasn't enough game there to warrant such a time commitment.  It also seemed like there wasn't any incentive to tell the truth because the chances of your luggage getting inspected were so slim that it pretty much made sense to throw everything you drew into there.  It also didn't seem like there was much incentive to actually open another person's luggage when you're the sheriff because if you take their bribe then you get the money and if you open it then the penalty goes to the bank.  I might be willing to give it another try, but I'm not particularly eager to play again.

This game had a lot of things in favour for me to like it (I tend to like bluffing, the theme was fun and the designers are Brazilian). Even so, I did not find it so challenging or interesting. A pity.

This seems to be a pretty good little game.  The suitcases are cool, but I wish there was a hole in the bottom to make it easier to push your cards out.  

There are really two parts to the game.  In the main part, you try to smuggle some goods and hope you aren't caught.  If you are caught, you can offer a bribe and since that is the only way the sherrif is going to make any money that round, you have a good chance of being able to work something out (unless you are the perceived winner).

The second part of the game is where you can save three cards per turn for the end of the game.  These cards score double, but only if the total number of cards save (between all players) is below a certain amount, or if you have the most of that card.  I totally messed up on the last part of the game, so I am giving the game the benefit of the doubt.  If I play it again, and it seems like the end can be manipulated by good play, then this rating stands.  If the last part of the game is a total crapshoot, then I will drop my rating by a point.

My negative reaction is probably just because I have a personality that radiates untrustworthiness, and thus, had a frustrating game of this. (As in I lost badly. Yes, I freely admit that how well I do affects my ratings, and I think there's nothing wrong with that.) You'd think being in last place in the money would stop me from getting searched every other time, but no. The mechanics encourage this, as it makes sense for the player(s) in the lead not to smuggle much, since they are targets and don't have much to lose, just as it makes sense for those who are losing to smuggle more, as they need to catch up and because they should not be targets so much. This, however, gives incentives to the Sheriffs to search the players who are losing more often than those who are winning. That's not really a good thing. Add in the luck of the card draw and the end-of-game scoring and the whole thing is just a mess. I don't think it's awful. It's just too long to enjoy for it's own silly sake, and I'd rather play Werewolf or Poker if I want lying and bluffing.

A really fun bluffing game.  I had so much fun playing this game, and am disappointed it's import only and so expensive.  I really hope I can find a copy of this one some day.

This is a fun bluffing game. It's easy to learn and supports up to 6 people. It plays fairly quickly and the smuggling theme creates some hilarious comments.

RATING: 6.75
A light party type game.  It was a perfect game to end the night on with 3 couples, including one novice gamer and three wives in the mix.  Not a ton of strategy, and a fair bit of luck on the card draws, but the bluffing aspect keeps it interesting.  After a second play with 6, I actually think that this game will be best for about 4.  6 is too many, as there is little likelihood you'll ever get caught.  We ran out of cards near the end.

After having played Sheriff of Nottingham before this, it really doesn't fare well in comparison. I can see how it inspired later games, but I am not really keen on this version. Would always prefer Sheriff.

A light-hearted bluffing game that really shouldn't be taken seriously.  Unfortunately, it could get quite frustrating if others keep targeting you for inspection, especially if you're behind, since in order to catch up you have to be able to smuggle more than everyone else.  I see the humor, but I didn't really enjoy the gameplay.  There is almost an underlying mean-spirited feel to the whole experience, once is enough for me.

The mechanics are in theory quite interesting, but this does not work. We played a bit incorrectly, but anyway one should always bluff and cheat as much as possible, as the penalty is quite small compared to the profit that there is to be made. Simply not my kind of game.

RATING: 7
Funny game with the right group (and you should know if your group is the right group). It is overproduced, but understand this is basically a party game toeing the line into strategic bluffing. Take it for what it is and it'll be good for laughs.

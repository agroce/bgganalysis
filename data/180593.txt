Anteprima Essen 2015 scritta da me: http://www.goblins.net/articoli/anteprima-essen-2015-bloody-inn

-

Acquistato al primo giorno di fiera, si è rivelato un gioco molto divertente e proponibile nelle più svariate occasioni.
Grafica originale e, per me, bellissima; meccanica di gestione della mano semplice ma raffinata (il costo per carta, a fine turno, è una regola semplice che limita strategie di accumulo); tempo ridotto; interazione presente nell'approfittarsi dei loculi altrui e finalmente un'ambientazione che lascia da parte pecore/legno/cavalieri/principesse per virare su un grottesco molto simpatico.

Da avere.

A game that surprised me. Simply put I did not expect to enjoy the game so much. It's theme comes out well as one can assume that it takes a bit of work to kill someone consistently and dont get caught and thus the lack of actions really means you feel like you are planning the perfect plan to not get caught. The tension of others aiming for the same victims also adds another dimension to the game as wait too long and you probably wont get that victim or recruit him to join your cause. Gameplay is fast and finishes in less than an hour once everybody knows what they are doing. The dept of preparing for the next turn or getting a sure smaller profit now is also another great feature in the game that builds into the theme of greed and such. 

Downside is the theme  might put some people off if taken too seriously. Also, it takes at least a full game to get use to the little nuances of the game and reading the text but after the first game, all of us did not even need to read the text and knew the powers. The second game was actually so much more strategic than the first.   

In conclusion, amazing and after I instantly went to order a copy. Great game and a different theme to be taken with a sense of humor.

RATING: 5.5
Despite the theme, it's quite a bit more bland and mathy than I'd been hoping. It fits an uncomfortable spot between something like Isle of Trains and Gloom.

The economic engine is a little too tight to really be very fun, and the game plays a bit too solitaire-ish and numerical to really take advantage of the theme. It doesn't have anything like Isle of Trains' player synergy, and while the sheds seem like they should give a bit of engine building potential, the bonuses are too small, you get too few of them, and it's very difficult to get synergy between them, due to a general difficulty in getting what you're aiming for.

Maybe with more plays you'd get a handle on the economic ebb and flow of the game and how to better angle for the things you want, but I'd still say that you're better to buy Isle of Trains or one of the Fleet games than to get this one.

Gloom has you swapping around good and modifiers, playing pranks, making the occasional big move by stringing cards together, etc. Bloody Inn doesn't have any of that. Here, I figured out that I could have really dicked everyone over by plugging their sheds with murdered peasants, but that's really the only thing you can do interactive in the game and I feel like there would be no winners if people started to play that way. There's no jokes on the cards, macabre nor otherwise. The only secondary mechanism in the game is swapping cash-on-hand for checks, so there's nothing else in the game to try and bring life to the theme.

Overall, this game is fine. But I'd suggest going for something better. The only reason to purchase it is the theme, and that's not a winning argument when Gloom exists.

I was very excited for this, but upon first play I found it a bit unwieldy and boring. More sessions will be necessary  to determine whether this was a product of mood, player count or a legitimate disconnect with play, but if left a bland impression (and little enthusiasm for another play). 

My partner in the two player session rather enjoyed it, however (I won).

Played once or twice, and I think the second time was a bit cumbersome but need more plays to decide.  Love the idea and how the mechanics *should* work.  Update: The game is a bit complex, which is good but means the learning curve is a bit steep for occassional play.  Still rate it 8/10

Wrapping your head around the concept of needing X number of cards to murder someone, X more cards to build a place to bury them, and X more cards to actually bury them, all before you're investigated by the police can take a while. For as simple as the rules are, the game requires a surprising amount of thought and planning. Not as light as it would seem, but is a very interesting game.

Nagyon tematikus játék a maga morbid módján: a szállásra betérő embereket lehet benne megölni, eltemetni, és ebből pénzhez jutunk. Mások sírhelyeit is használhatjuk, ilyenkor osztozunk a bevételben. A temetetlen halottaknak pedig kockázata van. A pénz beváltás része nem tetszik, felesleges szerintem. Összességében nem rossz, de nem vagyok benne biztos, hogy 4-5 parti után sok izgalmasat tudna mutatni.

Je runt een hotel, waarin je de gasten omkoopt, vermoordt, en begraaft.  Dat brengt het meeste geld op...
Maar je moet natuurlijk ook eerst zorgen voor voldoende begraafplaatsen.
En zorgen dat je genoeg zwart geld hebt om je handlangers te betalen... en op tijd witwast om weer plek te hebben in je zwart geld portemonneetje.

Biggest surprise of 2015. Just a real gem. The mechanics seem odd, at first, but there is a good deal of strategic depth in pretty straightforward gameplay. Fun theme, if you like a little darkness, and a good deal of strategies to try out. Top-notch, mid/light engine builder.

One of my favorite game ever. All of my game groups enjoy it so much and it plays well with all player counts. 
While many people say it's frustrating to have a very limited action, we found it very fun and quite challenging. IMO, formulating the best strategy under a restricted movement is one of the fun part. My friends always laugh and amused when other player took the wrong step. 
It also has a good replayability and pretty easy to teach to a new player, so it hits the table a lot. 
I don't think there's any negative point worth mentioning in this game. Oh.. and the artwork is awesome!

Quite a challenging game to say it looks like a filler, certainly not one to introduce new gamers to. Sort of an engine builder but the way the money is managed makes it difficult to have loose cash for long and therefore difficult to build a big engine. After one play I certainly want to play it again to get a better feel for it.

There’s nothing to redeem in this dry, uninspiringly Bloody Inn: it’s an eurogame of the worst kind, one of those that take a sick pleasure in preventing you from doing what actions you need whenever you need them done but force you to be content with the little you can take out of their oppressive rules.

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------------
Didn't think much of the end game, where in the last round you play as long as you have enough cards as # of players.  Didn't find the combos all that interesting.  I personally found the theme actually cool and different, but the gameplay was very disappointing since from the rules this sounded like a game up my ally.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite ~1 hour games. Seems like the variety of cards will wear thin at some point, but for now it's fantastic. An expansion could make this game even better.

Some players over-value cards that give you income based on guests as the game progresses. They don't realize that the more powerful cards are the 4F per card in the exit stack of a certain color, or the flat 2F per turn, or the reduction in spending cards until the end of the game. Not an issue for repeat players, but definitely one for new players.

Bloody fun time! Beautiful artwork and a light approach to a rather morbid subject helps The Bloody Inn avoid any moral qualms about sending your "guests" to their final resting place. Plays decent as a solitaire game too though I prefer a living opponent. Quick set-up and simplistic rules help drive the game forward at a decent clip. Average game takes 30-45 minutes, longer with more players.

RATING: 7
Very thoughtful and tricky strategy game. Did not expect the decision matrix to be so complex. Fantastic game that I am not even remotely close to mastering. Only downside...the better player will always win...likely by a large margin. Because of that and the time I have put in this has become a solo game as friends are tired of getting blown up all the time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
The story of the game is so much different that you must like it. But you do not have enough options or simply enough cards in your hands. So the real "kick" is missing, what you would expect of a game for killing people...

RATING: 6
9-25-16: Have been trying to get my hands on this game, for a decent price, since it was released. Game play was just okay, but it has that constant feeling of never being able to fully complete your plan with only two actions during each "night." However, the biggest let down may have been the anticlimactic ending. Your score is pretty much just what you have in front of you when the last action is taken. 
Very much on the fence about this game.

I usually tend to view the BGG rating on the low side, but for this initial play through it seems to be right on target.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Theme in this game is so cool. Everyone should try this game. It's different. Main mechanism is deck building by bribing guests in THE BLOODY INN or if we need money we can always kill them using our powerful band. Game is very solid. It is not boring, it is actually kind of exciting. You will also find negative interaction in this game which I am huge fan of :) Many decisions in a short time.

If You ever wanted to do something bad, out of law it is the best thing You can buy now (and avoid punishment) ;)

***There is a mistake in Polish edition on card "Konsjerż" (in the rulebook too - this error completly ruins sense of this card if You don't know how to play it propely!). Huge minus for printing game with mistake like this.

Es un juego de cartas en el que cada jugador es regente de una posada. El objetivo del juego es asesinar a los huéspedes para robarles el dinero, con la precaución de enterrarlos antes de que te pille la policía. Por lo visto está basado el juego en una película.
Las ilustraciones son impactantes.. y el desarrollo del juego es bastante rápido e interesante. El hecho de que acabásemos la primera partida empatados a puntos todos los jugadores da que pensar. Me reservo una opinión más definitiva para cuando haya jugado más partidas, pero de momento, es una buena impresión. 
No es  un juegazo, pero entretiene y es apto para no jugones.

Hard to decide on this game as I do typically like multi-use cards but for some reason the multi-use aspect in this game just felt confusing. Maybe it was the iconography as it took a bit to wrap our heads around. It felt really hard to get into the flow of the game because of that and while fast playing there was nothing exciting about what I was doing. The art is eye catching for sure, I just wish I felt more drawn in to playing the game as the theme is certainly unique.

I was pleasantly surprised by how good this is. Tough decisions each round about how to use your cards, which ones to discard, who to bribe and who to kill! Good tension between keeping cards to build up your engine and using / discarding them for powerful actions. And I love the macabre theme (especially the fact that it's more profitable to kill rich, powerful figures), and that the poor peasants can just hang out in the 'bistro' waiting to be hired.

Hey, I've been to that place in real life. The bloody Inn is a macabre game of engine building in which you enlist the help of various wayfarers and the ever-willing, ever-drunk and ever-bloodthirsty country folk of rural France to murder and filch innocent travellers. Some of your victims might even be former accomplices of your dastardly deeds. The game itself is simple enough and tightly designed. Players get to spend two actions a turn to either build, enlist, murder or bury to their hearts content or may pass in order to convert their victims cash money into more unsuspicious assets. Like it.

Theme and art made it stand out but the card play did not feel like it was anything special.  I'd play it again but no need to keep.

Good game but theme can be off-putting for some.  Also the game seems to end very quickly, this can be good as it adds a frantic element to the game, but it can also cause people to feel like any strategy they were coming up with was a failure.

This is a good card game which plays about 30 mins score points by having dead bodies buried under your annexes. Tight game as you use the cards as currency to buy as well as take actions...happy to play anytime!

The game really stood out for me for two reasons. 

First, the designer and the artist did a great job turning a morbid theme into a comical game.

Second, the art on the cover and the cards on this game was great.

Nonetheless, the game fell short for me.

I love this game, but only because we don't play it according to the rules. We play that you can only place bodies in your own buildings. It creates a more challenging experience that has less of a take that feel. If we played it correctly we would probably trade it off.

Un jeu français dans le lot. Mais ... un jeu Pearl game (ils font un jeu par an et, en général, c'est de la bombe). Une auberge sinistre au milieu de la France du 18ème siècle. Vous vous y arrêtez. C'est cher pour la chambre que c'est, mais où aller d'autre. Minuit, ça frappe à votre porte, humm.. l’aubergiste. Mais il cache quoi dans son dos ? aarrrggggllllll.....
L'auberge sanglante est un jeu de deck-building, où vous allez devoir éliminera vos clients, leur faire les poches, et aller les enterrer derrière la grange, sans se faire chopper par les flics. Sympa comme ambiance, non ?

Pour 2 à 4 aubergistes pas bien nets, pour des parties de 1H environ

I don't see the depth here. Acquire green annex guests. Build them to get free money. Acquire police cards to kill high ranking/money guests. Bury them safely. Ignore low ranking card powers as they are not worth while!

Some tricks may be to kill and bury low money cards on the leader but I don't think you gain much by doing so. You either got the cards you wanted as turn order favored you or you don't. Maybe everyone else can manipulate the police flop to ensure killers lose out before they can bury but that's not always likely.

Strategically seems shallow. Maybe a better game with fewer than 4?

After first two rounds I thought - what a boring game. After another few rounds - well - it's not that boring. You have of course randomness with the card draw (and deck preparation) - however the game is engaging and interesting. I did not expect it to be good (that's the reason why I did not pick it up at Essen) - however after few reviews I decided to give it a shoot. And it works. Mechanic is quite interesting and you don't have that much time to achieve what you want - so you have to make it quick.

Jugado en solitario:

Me gusta mucho. Eso sí, creo que hay que ser conscientes de que se han de poder hacer pocas cosas durante la partida, incluso en una partida "larga". El mazo vuela y hay que saber bien a qué se está jugando, a por cuáles cartas hay que ir en cada momento y no engolocinarse intentando siempre ir por las grandes. 

Siento que, más allá de parecer simplemente un juego táctico a primera vista, tiene un componente estratégico importante dado por los combos de construcciones de un mismo color y, también, debido a que hay que planificar, en lo posible (y hasta haciendo malabares), el desarrollo de las acciones a realizar.

Una cosa: al principio es inevitable estar completamente desorientado.

Lo que menos me gustó es que las primeras rondas se pueden hacer poco lentas. Tengo la sensación de que el juego demora en arrancar. Quizás esto cambie con el correr de las partidas.

RATING: 5
Multi-use card game with a very unique theme and artwork as well. It has four main actions which cost you cards in hand: bribe (get characters into hand), build annex (play characters from hand for special abilities and usually as places to put bodies), kill (choose a character to kill for potential money), bury body (get money from the body you've buried). Different suits of cards in hand can help with these actions, but cards in hand costs money per round. The end of the round could cost you money if bodies aren't buried. So, basically you get cards to help with actions and build annexes for additional efficiency. Nickle and dime your way to the most money to become the winner. There is a kernel of an interesting game here, but I find the card powers to be kind of bland and the round-to-round actions are pretty dull and devoid of interesting decisions.

Bloody inn has an interesting hand management mechanic, but really that is all that is here. Two actions per turn is very limiting and thus you never really connect with the theme as usually you need to spend a couple of turns setting up to actually whack a guy on the back of the head.

I am disappointed that there are so few 'murders' given this is the main theme of the game.

Diese Zangengeburt ist die eigentliche Brutalität des Spiels, an dessen Ende dann punktemässig alle mehr oder weniger gleichauf liegen.

The artwork and theme are great! The gameplay however seemed a bit lacking. Perhaps I need to play it more but something feels unnatural to me. Money is essentially points and is never really used. Instead, you have to use cards as trade currency. In addition, characters (cards) also become vaults...

I wish their was more components and that money was perhaps used to dig or purchase vaults, as if I was not only managing the inn but the cemetery.

One interesting dynamic missing from the solo version is the ability to bury your cards under an opponent's annex (and they yours for that matter). Besides that, works pretty well solo giving you the chance to try out different strategies and explore powerful card combos.

[b]Recommended player count: 1-4[/b]

[b]Comments:[/b]

Seems quite difficult to teach and is surprisingly complex but should be easy for those used to multi-use cards and games where you pay to activate cards by discarding other cards in your hand.

There is a limited form of interaction in that you should be paying attention to what your opponents are trying to do so that you can deny them the cards they need but chances are that you will be so focused on trying to achieve what [i]you[/i] want to do that you won't notice.

Will reward regular play with the same group of gamers that enjoy deep and thoughtful game play.

INITIAL IMPRESSION
I was going into this knowing the theme was something different that I liked the sound of.

However the game play wasn't as interesting as I thought it would be. There is a flow to the game where you want to start getting discounts for recruiting/building and then transition that into killing/burying for money. Of course there is tactical play to be made here based on many factors so say a kill/bury could be worth going for early strategy if the situation is favorable.

Ultimately you want to be getting some discounts on your actions as most things take at least 2 actions to setup. (recruit + build and kill + bury). I think the leaving people in the room part of the game is very marginalized.

We played the shorter version of the game and I think the game ended earlier than I would have liked. None of us were able to develop too many discounts/combos and only some people cashed out before the game was over. I would like to try it with the longer version and see if it gets enough engine/combo building going

Components are very good, and the art excellent for such a dark theme. The game is a typical euro, pretty fast to set up and play.

UPDATE 
The game in fast mode plays, well, fast! Which is a bonus if you consider that you can modulate the length of the game. Also the game seems to play differently in relation to length: in a short game, immediate goals are better than creating a motor for points which may be a best strategy for longer games.

It took half a game for most of the details to even make sense, but once they jelled, this was like a more relaxed Mottainai, and with an actual narrative arc. Very promising.

I have a soft spot for engine-building card games, The Bloody Inn is not an exception of course. Cards have multiple uses and you have to find synergy among cards and different combinations in order to build your engine early in the game. Some cards seem overpowered but the 40F limit makes a great balance for that. Theme and mechanics are perfectly blended, artwork is just outstanding. Fantastic game, I love it!

After several plays: It is much more deeper than it looks. Brilliant mechanic building and hand management game. My rating is slightly improved. Still more cards are needed for a replayability.

[floatleft][ImageID=2618699][/floatleft]The Bloody Inn is a light card game with a hefty dose of hand and action management. It's been well developed, has beautiful art, and probably a slightly polarizing theme, which personally I found charming despite the chilling thought of it being based on a true a story. The central mechanism in the game is how actions are taken, you play cards from your hand (1, 2, or 3 depending on the strength at which you need to perform the action), then return to your hand any cards that have an icon matching the chosen action. This incentivizes you to have a hand filled with lovely (and possibly soon to be dead) characters which specialize in the various actions. However, at the end of each round you must pay $1 per card in hand, dollars are VPs and that is one of the central tensions in the game. You can have a more efficient engine, but it costs you points, of course you'll make points more easily as well. 

[center][ImageID=2711711 medium][/center]

The positive interaction comes when you need to bury a corpse. You can bury them under one of your own cards in play receiving all of the money listed on the card, or you can bury them under an opponent's card and you split the money with them evenly. It's an interesting mechanism, which serves as a sort of catch up, but also opens up interesting strategic options. You can fill up your opponent's graves with inferior corpses, or you can try to entice people by having some graves available. There are some fun decision points in the game and different ways to play. In our game one of my friends attempted a no-kill strategy which nearly worked out, he ended just 3 points behind the leader. 

Okay so why the rating of 6? Well we played the short game and I felt that was a good choice for our first play, but that the pacing of the game would work much better if it were a bit longer. However, our game was about 45 minutes and I wouldn't want to play for longer than that, there isn't enough there to fully justify 45 minutes, let alone 60 minutes. Ideally this would play in 30 minutes. Perhaps that is possible once people have a play under their belts, and if it is I would certainly rate this a 7 and it could conceivable have a shot at being an 8 if future plays revealed more depth than I currently suspect exists.

RATING: 7
The outstanding feature of The Bloody Inn is the combination of a gothic theme (an episode from 'The Monk') and expressionistic artwork, an area where Pearl Games repeatedly succeeds in doing something different and more mature compared to the average artwork used in boardgames.

The game is enjoyable although nothing outstanding. It's a conventional tableau builder with multiple use cards that stays on the simple side of things. The card effects are limited and the same across four of the five different card types. Replay value is generated by the mix of the eight cards put on display each round. The competition for these few cards and only two actions per player per round assure that players want to do more than they can and face interesting decisions. Some strategic focus is needed but the tactical choices are dominant. Suffers from a slow buildup unless players are familiar enough with the game and play faster than we did.

Unlike most others, the theme is a slight turn off for me.  However, the game play mechanics are reminiscent "San Juan" which I really enjoy.

In my first (and only play so far), I screwed up and had to pay the gravedigger twice.  However, I did build a 3 building which gave me almost half of my points and the win.  I thought I'd finish last, but I finished first due to this building.  I wonder if it is overpowered.

First thing that jumps to mind is the oh so different theme, and has the exact right art style: not too cartoony, not too gory, but a bit of both. And not only that, but it's rather well integrated.

The central mechanism (pay with cards, some come back) is an incredible twist on the Race for the Galaxy/San Juan "cards as money". Plus, having each card have multiple uses, defined by their state (a dead card can't be built, for example) is pretty awesome. Perfect control of what come in your hand and incentive to keep it small also has great synergy with the rest of the mechanisms.

The game really flows well and I really didn't expect that. The theme is dark but the game is kind of abstracted for us and we don't feel like we kill and bury those people. We focus on the abilities and values of the cards so the dark theme doesn't prevent us from enjoying it. There are many great combos that you can pull off but if you focus too much on that you might lose the game because other person started profiting before you so, it also feels like a race in that aspect.

感想：
1.相當高主題性遊戲，而且是難得一見的黑色幽默
2.畫功很好
3.機制上運氣存在於開牌的順序。每局的遊戲變化存在於出場的牌，牌數，以及次序，重玩性還可以。
雖然長遠規劃不大，較重視如何當下組成自己的引擎並加以發揮是重點，有創建所帶來的滿足感
4.互動性只存在於搶奪手牌，警察，和充填別人房屋，但由於turn order是輪流，所以互動也只能是順道，整體而言都以自己顧自己為主。
5.每次玩都有屈卒的感覺。而且做好人是不會有勝利的（奸笑）

I really wanted to like this game but am very disappointed.  During each round there are very limited options in what can be done because cards are needed to pay the cost for everything yet you can really only acquire a couple of cards each round.  Thus conceivably it could take six or seven or more rounds to get and score a level three guest.  Additionally the card powers themselves are rather bland and boring.  Someone here made a comment about dancing in a straight-jacket which somehow sounds fitting.  It seems there's potential but the actual gameplay is slow, dull, and disappointing.  I was ready to buy this game untried but not now.  This is now an example for me of "try before you buy".  I'm willing to give this game another try but it won't be on my own purchase.

RATING: 8
I am a big fan of this game. It is a somewhat light card game and engine builder. The artwork is absolutely incredible, which drew me to the game in the first place. The theme may not be for everyone but I am a fan. And for a game about killing people, there is not much there in terms of violence or gore. The game plays smooth and each action you can take is clear and identifiable thanks to the very helpful player aid cards. I really like the money max and laundering money mechanic. It definitely changes how you play and losing a few Francs due maxing out and not laundering money early enough can definitely come back to bite you. Have only played with two players but want to try with higher player counts. A great, somewhat quick game that offers light gameplay and lots of strategies. I actually wish the game lasted a bit longer.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Cool artwork, but the game itself has problems. Like Race for the Galaxy (which I love), cards are your currency in addition to granting special powers if you put them in your tableau. The problem is that getting more cards to pay for all the actions in the game costs cards. There's no action to simply get a decent amount more cards. The result is that you're often left without good actions since you can't afford anything. Can't save up for a big move either, as you're penalized for every card in your hand at the end of each round. Not recommended.

I think making a game where players have to effectively kill innocent sleeping people, just for getting points, is highly disturbing and irritating.

For me there is a big difference between killing/defending against evil enemies and killing innocent people while they are sleeping like you have to do it in this game.

Probably their next expansion will be poisoning newborn babies for victory points while they are sleeping.

Don't get it why people are even playing this game.

Extremely annoying.

Verdict: [b]Enjoyed my stay![/b] I played and really enjoyed this game, and later bought a copy to add to the collection. My buddies argue that a few of the cards might be broken, but I'll reserve judgement on that until I play this a few more times to see how balanced the cards are for myself. (Suggestion to compensate for overpowered cards; instead 6 initial and 4 each remaining in exit deck.)

This is a curious little beast.  Based on real-life historical events, the game has you play the owners of a small French country in who waylay and murder their guests -- and bribe local officials to get away with it.  It's a basic resource management game, really no more than a series of simple cost-benefit analyses; the rules aren't the big hook, but rather the theme and the artwork.  It's got decent replay value, but it's mastered very quickly.

Thematically, though, it's just fantastic -- perfectly executed, making you balance moral and practical choices, and very creepy.  The art, I can't say enough about; it has some of the best visuals of any game I've ever played in my life (very reminiscent of comics artist Bill Sienkiewicz).  With a better ruleset it'd be amazing.

Excellent card management game, with good replayability and good play length.  Scales well from 2 to 4 players.  Everyone I have introduced it to has enjoyed it and asked to play it again.  The rules are unusual enough and complex enough, and there are enough exceptions, that it is not a good fit for light/non-gamer type of players.  I really like the art and the theme adds some flavor to what is simply a card game.  Good degree of interaction, interesting choices.

I'm drawn to games with multi use cards so I knew I would likely enjoy this one.  Right now my rating is affected (lower than I anticipated) by the tight nature of the actions and some of the luck of the draw.

Tight actions - You only get two actions per turn and you have to balance what must be done and keeping your money in line.  Makes the game a little more tighter and stressful than I typically enjoy in a game, especially for something this light and quick.

Luck of the draw - sometimes the cops show up and you can't deal with them effectively (because you only have 2 actions) - costing you the future income from the dead body and the money to dispose of it.  Is it poor planning on your part and pushing your luck? Yes, that is likely, but it's also really demoralizing.  You have to hope your opponents end up with a similar mistake or you'll be too far behind to catch up now since the game is so tight.

Still, it has been enjoyable to play.  It's always fun when the cops show up and you hear the groans from the players with dead bodies that need dealt with quickly.

Don't let the box fool you--this game is basically just a deck of cards. Interestingly, considering there aren't many components, the game does feel a bit fiddly. Also, the art is certainly not for everyone. I like it fine, but my wife doesn't care for it. The game is rather straightforward. At it's heart, it seems like an engine building/card management game. I don't think there is anything particularly innovative here, as the "killing" is just another way to gain money/victory points. I do appreciate how the mechanics integrate into the gameplay, even though I don't find it particularly thematic. It might seem like I'm ragging on the game, but I actually like it. It's not my favorite in this category by an means, but it's light, quick to set up, offers a unique theme, plays great with 2, and can be played in under an hour.

It is certainly not a heavy game, but you do have to decide how to best use each card, create some synergy in your deadly engine, and keep track of your money situation; light to medium weight decisions in a quick and easy to explain game is always nice. In some ways, the gameplay is oddly similar to Last Will. I LOVE the macabre, so that may play into my rating a bit. A killer of a filler ;)

I found it a bit tricky to get my head around at first. Most things in the game require a couple of steps to perform, and you only get 2 actions a round, so it's hard to play ahead.

It's not terribly thematic, but I enjoyed the setting and especially the artwork.

This game has some simple fun mechanics and is easy to learn. Its hard to get an engine going but it's great to play simply because the theme is hilarious!

I enjoy games that ask you to discard cards to pay for things. This game is very tight on actions, however, and I'm not sure it really works for me. It reminds me of London in that I keep trying to build engines when there really isn't time to do so. I know I shouldn't play against a game's grain, so maybe it isn't for me? I hope further plays change my mind, but I'm not sure I will get them if I don't pick this up.

It's hard to put my finger on, but I find this one rather charming (despite the somewhat morbid theme).  It plays somewhat longer than a filler, yet has a good bit of depth.

It's a card game with a pretty cool and unique theme where players each have an Inn and they want to kill and bury the clients in order to get their money... and they want to do this without obviously attracting the attention of the Police!

RATING: 6
Unlike any other card game I think I've played. The Bloody Inn takes the core concept of multi-use cards and combines it with the element of using your cards to pay for actions. First, the Inn is populated with visitors (of different types). Then, players will decide how to use their two actions to kill, bribe, build annexes, or bury bodies under annexes. It's a strange but interesting tightrope walk of trying to select the best actions with the best combination of cards available. I've only played this one at 1 and 2 players, but so far it's been successful. I think that 3 or 4 would likely be the sweet spot, but 1 and 2 are both good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
If not for the art work I would probably have never picked this up. The macabre style is gorgeous. The game isn't half bad either. It's a surprisingly tight engine builder where you always feel that you're 2 steps away pulling off the perfect move. This will frustrate some but I find it fits well with the morbid theme. It's simple, plays relatively quick at 4-players and doesn't outstay its welcome.

Interesting and entertaining theme which is only as deep as the artwork.

You know those limited actions games where you always have the feeling "if I could have just done one more thing". This game just takes it too far IMO. The theme is fun, the gameplay is fun as well, but you just can't seem to get anything done - while the game, on top of that, seems to drag on just too long.

Really fun and unique game, both thematically and mechanically. Sort of feels like a more enjoyable Bruges, to me. I especially like the economy of knowing when to bank your cash and when to keep it around to pay your accomplices. I was interested in this game, but I'm very happy with the result, now that I've played it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Don't let the many different cards fool you - The Bloody Inn is not about building powerful combos but rather managing your hand carefully so that you have the cards you need exactly when you need them. Whatever you need to do (murder guests, prepare burying places, hire accomplices etc.), you must first acquire cheap cards, then pay with cheap cards to buy more expensive cards and then pay again to actually play the card. But too many cards will cost you, as will having murdered but not yet buried a guest if policemen happen to stay at the inn.

This is exactly the kind of tense "never have enough actions" gameplay I like. Unfortunately, the game doesn't seem to know what kind of game it wants to be. Personally I think The Bloody Inn would have benefitted from a cleaner design with shorter gameplay and less special card abilities while other commentators would like to have more time to build stronger combos from those abilities.

It's a very thematic card game, which some may consider macabre. I however, think it's very well done.

The game never seems to have enough actions to do what you need. You get two per turn and seemingly need twice that to do anything.

The game plays quickly, a four player game can be done in an hour.

Very good game overall.

We assume the role of greedy innkeepers that slaughter their guests during the night in order to rob them. You must set-up a nice network of helpers dedicated to kill, rob and bury the bodies below buildings before the law enforces discover your diabolical machinations. And surprisingly enough, the theme survives the abstract nature of the game.

The rules are very simple, yet their offer many possibilities with each action. Each round, new guests arrive at the inn and you can interact with any of them in a number of ways. But you can only do a couple of actions each round, and this is what will make you despair and also love the game. The good moves need several actions and you will have to assume risks. Will you prepare for big hit during several rounds or will you just pull the trigger and pray? If you do the first, you expenses will be much higher and maybe there will be no rich guests whenever you'll be ready. If you do the later, maybe the law enforcers will come in numbers during the next day and will catch you with your pants down.

This is a tactic game about how well you can adapt the changing events, a tactic game about plans B, plans C and Plans D. In the very first play you realize this is a very polished and solid game. They have spent time to make it a good game, you can see the mechanisms have been designed to make your life more difficult; and this is something that the average gamer is not going to enjoy.

There are many ways to go, but none of them feels stronger than the others. The tension is always there, especially if you assume risks.

The game flow will be quite fast, but ocasionally some players will hit a wall and they will need some time to decide. Fortunately, these are rare occasions.

L'auberge sanglante est la dernière bonne pioche que j'ai pu effectuer, le jeu venant à peine de sortir. Ce jeu regorge d'une multitude de mécanisme tous plus attirants les uns que les autres : votre stratégie et votre adaptation aux autres membres de votre famille d'aubergistes sanguinaires vont être mises à l'épreuve pour remporter la partie :-). La partie solo peut être bien pour tester des nouveaux combos/mécaniques avant de les mettre dans les gencives de vos adversaires ;-). Du fait qu'un certain nombre de cartes sont retirées du talon avant de commencer la partie, cela implique que l'on ne connait pas ce qui nous attend et cela nous appelle à nous renouveler à chaque fois. Il y a des parties par exemple où il est difficile d'assassiner car il y a toutes les forces de l'ordre dans le talon :-). Le thème est également original et reste bien pensé. Je recommande vivement ce jeu qui peut être joué autant par les experts que les amateurs du genre !

A very nice card game with a brilliant, although macabre, theme.

The starting player in a round welcomes the guests. The purpose here is to put the guests, which he thinks that will not reside in their room for the night, in the other players rooms. When they do not reside in their room, they will be either bribed or killed. Bribed guests will work for you. Killed guests will earn you money once they're buried. You can also build more annexes to the inn by building a place to live for your bribed staff, which will give you extra space to hide those dead bodies, and it will also trigger a special action.

Your purse can only hold 40 francs, so once in a while you will need to launder that money and turn into cheques. This way you can earn money again. The player who earned the most money (including cheques) wins the game.

I have played both the short as the long version. I recommend everybody to play the long one. It takes about 15 minutes extra, and only then you can really put those annexes to good use. Short version can serve as an introduction but there is not as much depth.

A game fueled by theme. Unique stories are crafted each game- your right hand man could be the local mechanic. enlisted to help in the crafting of annexes, while the town's newspaper boy can sweet-talk the local priest, making that exposed body get buried that much easier. 

Enlist the local constabulary, or bury them all in your butcher's shop? Regardless of the decisions made in the game, the results are always amusing, in a morbid way.

The mechanics themselves are interesting enough, in that there are many options per turn to choose from, and the need to launder money means that planning is often necessary, especially so high ranked kills aren't wasted.

The gorgeous artwork (what initially drew me, and many others in), only makes the experience that much more engrossing.

A holiday gift from Jon!

The Bloody Inn is about being innkeepers who murder people, loot their bodies, and bury them before the cops show up asking questions. Mechanically, this game has a lovely escalation as you build up your hand (and at the end of each round you have to pay francs to keep cards in hand), build necessary annexes, and begin killing guests and burying them. 	

The art is lovely and weird, and the setting actually sorta forgives the standard lack of diversity (it's 19th century France, so of course it's wall to wall white people). This game makes me happy, and it is experiences like this that bring me joy.

I was underwhelmed after playing this. Not truly bad, but not a game I'm likely to seek out playing again. I personally don't like the artwork that much, but I did quite like the idea of the theme. Too bad then that most of the game has little to do with actually killing the inn's guests. 

The rules are a bit tough to grasp making this hard to teach, but the decisions are not that tough meaning many experienced gamers will be looking for more meat for the time this takes. (I know I did). I sense there are some good and cool ideas here, but I wish they were implemented in a more streamlined fashion that highlighted the interesting bits and took out the rest.

I had high hopes for it... In fact it offers too few actions, only two in a round. THat's not enaugh for what you are planning for. It takes too long until you get your engine to work. And this is point 2. After you got you hand to a certain point, you wont change it a lot and it will be allways the same.
This one was one of two must-buys and now is the only disappointment of Essen.

Esteticamente es un juego que me gusta mucho, el arte en mi opinion esta muy bien escogido para el tema. El juego es sencillo en cuanto a reglas pero con combos de cartas que en un principio y en mi caso me abrumaron un poco, con la segunda partida la cosa fue mejor. Jugado a tres.

Hate the 3 cost characters, not enough time to make use of them vs the cost. I just hate when a game forces the actions you have to take during your turn. This makes a short game with little options become a short game with very little options.

The Bloody Inn's main draw is undoubtedly the quirky theme and yet, unfortunately, it fails to deliver for me on that front... the macabre vibe is all but coming through and gets less immersive with every play.

On the upside, while a light game, The Bloody Inn offers some interesting decisions, and it is pleasant enough, the game delivering a veneer of depth just deep enough to dip a toe in every now and then.

A decent game, but by no means great.

The macabre theme works extremely well. The mechanics of having multiple ways of using each card are interesting, and there are many different approaches you can take to try to win the game.

game starts off feeling a little random and swingy, although with fun (immoral) push-your-luck choices. you want to get a strategy started, but you don't really know what's going to come down the path so you often find yourself engine building only slightly and with an emphasis on flexibility. ah, but in the second half the unaccosted guests will return. this time you know if you're going to see a majority of a certain color! the last half is about leveraging your network of helpers, annexes, and/or money to pin down the biggest scores. oh, but knowledge and solid groundwork isn't everything! you can have the best murder machine around, although if you don't stop to launder money occasionally then you're doomed to spill over and reap only inefficiency! the game is really clever, although thoroughly morbid. the impressionist art fits to give everyone a sense of unknown thoughts, perhaps a potentially evil aura, or maybe almost paranoia. and they'd be right to be afraid! a great game, but not one i feel comfortable having on the shelf at work. i'm considering trading it away not because i dislike it, but more because i pass it over these days for more family friendly games and because it really does deserve a good home.

Another game that i would want to like with all my heart, but ultimately i can't. The art is fantastic, but the game really does not give you enough resources to enjoy all the options it offers you. Every tun you got two actions, the basic action allow you to take two cards to use as a resource...and you actully need cards to do anything: kill a guest, you need cards. Hire a guest, you need cards. Turn a guest into a "building" (makes very little sense), you need cards. Bury a corpse, you need cards. The fact that every turn the board get a reset does not help: you will usually find yourself gathering cards in your hand, losing point for those, and hope for the next board to got something you need. You end the game with the feeling of having done very little of what you could, and that the game could have been better with just some little fix.

Not a bad game, but it just didn't really click with me.  I felt a bit at the mercy of what I drew and what came up every round and it was hard to get any engine going.  While that may just be "the game," it felt like I should have been able to do more...and then it was over.

I find the theme quirky, but it's a turn off to those I've introduced it to. The game is a convoluted and players tend to be a little lost until about half way through the first play.

PRO: extravagant theme and visuals over a run off the mill multi-purpose card based engine building euro.
CON: see above. 

On one level there's this interesting theme with a bit different visuals (from artists of Brazilian Coup) that could have worked a bit more on legibility of fonts. On the other level's it's same old optimising game with restricted actions and a chain of resource conversion (to get money you need to: get cards in your hand, build a new building, kill a guest, bury it under a building. For each of these you pay with cards). The there's a whole lot of restrictions and most of your actions you're trying to somehow bypass them or walk around them or whathaveyou and maybe even build a bit of an engine that will make this easier. The game has a promise of a little bit of interaction (burying people under other people's buildings sharing profits) we didn't manage to explore yet in 2 plays as you need to internalize all the clunky cogwheels first. On the third level the whole thing is kinda clunky where you sweat a lot just to push it along. And there are some restrictions there just for the hell of it - seems like somebody read that Knizia's mantra of "you know you want to do so many things, but you can't do them all" a bit too literally as not much gameplay is gained, everything just adds another step in the whole procession of steps.  

Basically you win by optimising the heck out of all your actions and those few bits of your engine. Or grab one of few cards with enormous end game bonus and win (which I did twice. Only by small margin in both cases, but still). 

So all in all - small production game, tried tested and tedious mechanics over a unique theme and different visuals - a typical KS game or an Essen release. If you own zillion of such games and want a zillion more of them, knock yourself out. Otherwise nothing to see here.

Rating down to 1.0 because: Uninspired. Yeah it's a crime. Run of the mill engine building tableau builder with hard to read visuals and a supposedly "quirky" theme. Oh, gee, picture me ... being more engaged staring at the ceiling.

Played twice with 3P. Checking guests out prematurely in the 19th century is no straightforward task – there are accomplices to be recruited, annexes to be built and bodies to be buried. All actions require cards to be discarded from hand, plus there is a two-action cap and card-hoarding penalty to work with.

The theme here is well-integrated and matched by some equally ghoulish artwork. It takes a little getting used to the sequence of actions and restrictions, but beyond that the game is a little ordinary.

A játék témája eléggé véres. Fogadónkba vendégek jönnek, aki vagy túlélik az éjszakát vagy kilyuggatva végzik. A hullát muszáj eltüntetnünk a rendőrök elől, különben kemény pénzekkel fizetünk, amire a játék megy. Épületeket építünk, amik alá szépen elhantoljuk a gyilkosságaink áldozatait. Itt is minden lap többfunkciós. Velük fizetünk, velük gyilkolunk, őket építjük és őket gyilkoljuk. Szóval sok újdonság nincs benne, de gyorsan véget érő játék miatt van min gondolkodni, hogy hogyan építsük föl a gyilkos tervünket. A grafika egyedi, de nekem annyira nem jött be. Egy játékra nem könnyű megítélni, de annyira nem éreztem átütőnek.

Although the game is somewhat derivative, it's saved by a great theme and even greater art.  If the theme were farming in the middle ages I'd almost definitely not bother with it, but watching *bodies* pile up instead of apples or ducks just makes the game more fun, evocative, and engaging.

If it wasn't for the theme I would ditch this game but... how many games are about murdering residents in a hotel and trying to dispose of the bodies? I have to keep it for the premise. The game play is very very basic. The only reason for me to play it (besides the theme) is to see if I can find good card combos, otherwise you seem to just do the same thing endlessly. And with the luck of the draw... typically not my style.

RATING: 7
Quite elegant, every action is done by the same mechanism, so once a player sees one of the actions in the game they'll most likely understand most of the game. I certainly needed multiple plays to get a feeling on how the game flows (how long you can 'set up' a engine vs. when you start using it to earn money).  It certainly has an engine building feel where you eiter get the right buildings to make actions really cheap (and maybe get some 'combos' - like the ability to bury multiple corpses and other building which make the bury action cheaper) or you try to get the right hand of characters to to your actions (if possible with some additional income buildings to pay those cards in your hand). There are certainly multiple strategies which can be used to get a good score.

The only rule which seemed off was the launder money rule, but as soon as we were in the middle of the first game we saw how many tactical decision come out of that rule, so after playing the game it seems genious.

The solo mode is fun and gives a great feel of the game. In a multiplayer game you have plenty of choises which can have  consequences for an opponent, even the distribution of guests in the rooms.

Since not all guests are used in a game you can never be entierly sure what effect will be available.

„Krwawa oberża” to bardzo oryginalny tytuł który wyróżnia się nie tylko tematem, grafikami ale i niestandardowym rozmiarem pudełka. Gra się bardzo dobrze we 2, 3, 4 osoby lecz też wariant solo sprawia dużo przyjemności i nakłania do kolejnych rozgrywek. Największa bolączką tytułu są bardzo cienkie karty, ale mają ciekawą fakturę. Grając w ten tytuł nie mogłem się oprzeć wrażeniu, że taki system prowadzenia hotelu sprawdziłby się w hotelu poselskim. Bardzo dobra, groteskowa gra. Polecam 7/10

This game fell flat for me. Too much calculating in your head and reading cards for this to be a sheer party game or light filler. But I don't think it had enough meat to be a serious game either.

RATING: 7
Rating is likely to change over time, though whether it will go up or down remains to be seen.  I love the art, of course, and the feel of this game just seems on point.  Especially during the first few plays, there's a very evocative sense of tension as you plan and execute your first few murders.  Maybe you strangle a newsboy and hurriedly stuff him under the floorboards?  Then you realize that you've gotten away with it, you're safe, and you just made more money than you'd be reasonably expected to make in months of honest innkeeping.  Later in the game, you've taken it to HH Holmes levels, with teams of loyal accomplices bribing, killing, and burying on your behalf, and you feel both unstoppable and very rich.  It's morbidly thrilling!

That said, I'm not sure whether repeated plays will start to feel too similar (it's a fairly light game at heart) or whether new elements of strategic depth will reveal themselves.  Time will tell!

Love this darkly delightful little game of murder and theft. The more I put this on the table the more enamored I am with it. Its a nice little tableau builder with some interesting concepts. I like the way you must as some point take the pass option to launder money so that you then have the ability to get more. Great idea. You should look into this one seriously.

I like that the game doesn't over stay it's welcome either.  Honestly the game itself gives you the option for a short or long game but I always play long and still feel it's not grown old.  If i were strapped for time I would  play it as a short game and I feel certain it would be just fine there as well.  The game plays wonderfully with 2, 3 or 4 players.

The Bloody Inn is a game that struck me the first time I saw it. It's got a creative and unusual theme (you murder, rob and bury the visitors to your inn) and the artwork is a unique style that I think is quite beautiful.

I had watched an overview of the game and knew that it was something I was interested in. I've been waiting a while to play the game, despite knowing two people who had ordered the game a while back. So I was pretty excited to try it out.

I liked the game a lot. One thing that hadn't been apparent to me in watching the overview was just how painful it was to only have two actions in a turn. I ended up muddling my way through the game feeling like I was completely off in my timing.

I spent a lot of time recruiting peasants and building annexes, and only late in the game got around to the serious business of murdering people. I definitely need more practice trying to figure out how to dance with this game at it's pace, instead of trying to force my own onto it.

I also didn't realize how quickly we'd end up going through the deck and I was unconsciously playing for a much longer game than it ended up being. I was surprised when the game ended and found myself with a handful of cards and nothing to do on my last turn of the game.

RATING: 5
Allright game, with rather simple yet somewhat unique rules. Advantages: somewhat unique theme, design and feeling. Disadvantes: too little strategic options, too many buildings are too weak. It's a fine little game without too much think - the playtime is a bit too long to be a filler though, and the short game option is too short to make a good game. It could be a great game, but the strategy is too simple to be a really good game. It's "ok" but there is always games I'd rather play... 

3 actions pr. round or something like that might improve it, making the choices less locked (kill one at the right level, burry him as well).

The Bloody Inn effectively makes players feel they are under resourced in number of actions, constrained even as they power up in Euro economy engine effectiveness.  The action windows are short and turns play real tight, which makes the game flow quickly.  The short game variant provides an alternative to play The Bloody Inn as a filler.  Solo play means you can play it yourself before teaching others.

Cardgame that is just as involved and brainburner-y as a full boardgame. And its theme really comes to life through the original artwork. Still, I do need to be in the mood for such an involved cardgame. The game can easily have a runaway leader if he or she manages to build a good engine and sticks with it. Also, it really needs a playthrough to get a good grasp of how to win.

Fantastic medium-weight limited-action card game. Tense all the way through due to limited actions and interactive in the lovely indirect way that still sees you playing with the people around you.

While it may be a turn off for some, I get a real kick out of the morbid theme and the way I can spin rules explanations thematically ("You can't take money out of the pockets of a fresh corpse! You're not a monster, after all...").

If there's one complaint, it's that the Short game is nearly always *too* short, making it overly frustrating with familiar players and not much of a teaching tool for new ones.

Super duper excited about the announced expansion!

Provisional rating, one incomplete play at Spiel.  Maybe didn't see enough of the game, as it's quite slow to get the engine going, and I do want to give it a more thorough play. Not as keen on the art as are some people.

Not a bad game but the theme is awful (to me at least). Outside of that, it is a card game with some strategic plays. Won't play again due to theme.

I find the theme is quite unique, though kinda bit hard to chew the game play. Its OK but I don't get the wow part in the mechanic. Still consider to let this one go.

Interesting hand management, engine building, card game. Very hard to get your head around how to play this well. I do not know if it is a good game to keep long-term, but a keeper until I figure out how to play it properly.

I also played a game called, 'The Bloody Inn' which I like the theme of - that of the dastardly innkeeper who kills and/or bribes off his guests, in order to loot the bodies for cash. I did struggle to take on board all of the options and card combinations but the three who played enjoyed the experience.

Ok, the theme is a little bit odd but the game has a good pace, difficult decisions and a lot to do. Unfortunately I have played it only solo so far but I am guessing that it will be much better as multiplayer. It's definitely getting more plays.

Great to have a different theme/art work to the game. I really enjoyed it and would be happy to play some more. Thought it was fairly well streamlined, enjoyed the system of laundering money. It is a little apparent how some of these things are used to trammel a runaway leader but I think it is all to the benefit of the gameplay.

First off, the theme is awesome. When I sat down to play it, I expected a one dimensional half-baked game that would only be interesting for as long as we took the time to tell little stories about our adventures terrorizing peasant at the inn. Most games of this sort run out of interesting things to say after a game or two.

What I found instead was a masterfully crafted puzzle, a game that always leaves you feeling like you are one action short of what you need to do, which is always a welcome trait for those who enjoy challenging games. The tight action constraints have a nice side benefit of racketing up the tension too. A big part of the game is figuring out when you can take your time getting rid of the evidence, or if you will have to bribe half the town to cover it up. It can make for some hairy situations when three cops check into the hotel the day after you have "checked-out" one of your wealthy guests.

This seems like it would be a fairly rules intensive game, but it's not. There are only four types of cards and the bulk of the rules fit on the single card player aids. On the other hand, it might also sound like a loose role-playing game. Nope. While the rules are simple, the mechanics are very tight and you have to unlock a puzzle almost every turn. It feels like plotting, executing and covering up a crime, absolutely nailing its macabre theme.

Honestly, it might get old after a few plays and the shocks and laughter wear off. For the moment though, I like what I see. Hopefully it holds up.

Great theme and artwork. Think this game is going to take me a few plays to workout, it seems really tough to get going. I suspect it needs some bold moves to get the big numbers moving, and probably the not the short version of the game.

I love the artwork and the theme, but what turns me off about this game is the limited number of actions I can perform in a round. I constantly feel restricted in what I can do during my turn. The fact that you have to "pay" for everything with the cards further limits your options. There's a lot of randomness in drafting cards and the tableau building part of the game is rather boring. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A fun card game with a cool theme.  What's not to like about killing your guests!

Rating might go up a little with further plays as we just played the short game, so we didn't quite get our engines going.

On second thought, While the theme is fun, there are a few unfortunate design choices.  First, annex powers are really almost pointless.  And, what is the $1 per guest reward about??

So, dropping the rating a bit.

I received a horrible explanation of the game and I thought the game was quite lame. After a few turns we got the gist of it and we all quite liked it: good rhytm, symple enough but with some interesting choices (more tactical than strategic, i'd say).
It would be slightly more than 7 but the art is soooo awful to behold that i will stick to my 7

A twisted family of farmers, cold blooded killers, buy a hotel on the outskirts of Peyrebeilrle to profit off the misfortune of unsusptecting travelers. Card game of bribing accomplices, killing hotel guests, taking their wealth and creativily finding places to bury the dead bodies without being detected by the visitng local enforcement. Get the best return from your assigned hotel rooms. The trick of the game is timing the best action (recruit, murder, bury) with your limited hand size of special ability accomplices to recycle them back to your hand. I'm also amused by the laundering mechanic converting score track points into laundered money. A lot of groups playing this during Essen they seemed to be having fun. Its missing something for me.

Bought in Essen (2015). Higher rating pending more games. Our first game was great fun, because the theme of murdering the guests of your inn while creepy is quite entertaining ("You should really start burying some of the dead bodies piling up in your yard!" "Nope, I'll just keep shooting the police.") and our first game promised quite a bit of depth with a smooth mechanic that's easy to remember (just pay the cards level with your hand cards whatever you want to do with it bribe/shoot/bury/build).

RATING: 8.3
Relatively simple card game with very dark humour and awesome artwork. The theme is pretty gloomy, as players are running an inn and try to kill off their patrons in order to steal their money. 
Once you know the number system behind the card play the mechanisms of this game are really pretty easy, but the hand management ist extremely difficult and you are never quite satisfied and always want to play some more.

6 after 1 play

Artwork and game components are average. Player interaction is not particularly strong. The game also lacks a strong story arc. The short game length is such that players do not get the opportunity to have the time to build a strong engine. The theme is rather morbid, with a dose of black humour.

Much deeper and smarter game than it looks.
After 1 play, you really have to think about every move, because you don't have many actions, and you have to be very careful not to be punished for not hiding a corpse.
Simple mechanics, hugely interesting.

What a strange theme... but surprisingly funny in a throwing dudes in the Volcano in Pompeii sort of way.

The game itself is a nice combination of card/money management, tableau building and a splash of press your luck.  I'd like to try again to see how it plays with a better grasp on the engine building from the get go.

Interesting theme and simple mechanics, but a little bit boring: you find yourself doing always the same things over and over, with not many possibilities to choose different strategies. Very often there is just one thing that you can/have to do and this becomes boring after a while.

Each guest that comes through is a tradeoff on several levels: I want the guest in my room to live so I can earn a little money. …but I want to kill guests for their money. …but I want this guest to build her/his annex for me so I can have its benefit. …but I need someone with her/his skills to help me accomplish these gruesome and dirty deeds. Wads of what I love in a game (tradeoffs) in a quick playtime (extensible as you see fit). The theme is off-putting, but the presentation and mechanisms make it so appealing that I can thoroughly enjoy the game anyway.

Sleeve your cards.

The game has some nice ideas about the story background，so in my opinion the theme is pretty strong and fit in the mechanism along with the amazing ironic and odd artwork.
But there are too much unbalance in the game.Some cards are far more stronger than others,and since there is always a first player and the existing of the random-formed deck,you usually cant fix or cover the luck problem with combo or other advanced actions because the game is relatively light and some cards are too strong too catch on.I have a really bad experience about the game although it seems really cool and appealed me at the first place.

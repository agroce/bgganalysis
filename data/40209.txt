Although there are rules to play short scenarios, you really have to play the full campaign to get any satisfactiuon from this because good/bad play is all about strategy over the full timescale not what may or may not happen on a single day (which is largely luck based. This is good but it can get a bit monotonous and drawn out. Evokes the theme very, very well though.
Better than the original because it allows you to play both sides.

RATING: 8.2
Great and considerate update to a genuine classic.

Feels a bit more difficult than the previous version (a lot more consecutive raids seem to happen to me - the most tense part now seems to be drawing the second event card when you find out how many hours will pass after the current raid... In my last game I had used almost every single unit in luftflotte 2 before 12pm! I'm willing to put this down to randomness but it is painful when it happens. There is one event in particular that says "all [A] squads on patrol move to inflight box" which has crippled me more than once)

Looking forward to trying Eagle soon!

It has grown on me (only played Lion so far). The first plays felt mechanical, with not much decision making but a lot of game admin to work through. Now the die rolling is familiar, the subtleties of squadron deployment, reserve management and deciding how to respond to raids have come to the fore, It can be a surprisingly tense game, especially when yet another TA-0 card comes up and a major raid heads for a depleted sector...

My only problem is the classic boardgamer's wargame issue.

Paper map!

Going to invest in some perspex. Should be easier to make a detailed judgement then.

My initial feelings are very positive.

Trade: Punched but hardly played. Just didn't suit my lifestyle. I enjoy the game a lot but opportunities to play never come up.

Very engaging solitaire system.

The rules aren't all that heavy. A little procedural in nature, but not heavy. Before the end of your first complete campaign, you won't be checking the rulebook anymore.

I just think that RAF suffers from a slight lack of decisions to be made by the player as the commander of the british (or german) air fleets.

It's not at all as simple (and "un-exciting", IMO) as B-17. It certainly has some interesting decisions to be made at every round. Just not enough for me to rate it a "top 3" game among the solitaire systems in my collection.

I like wargames (solitaire or otherwise) that put many interesting challenges of different natures to my analysis and decision at every round. Generally, you can boil everything down to resource and probability management. RAF has that, but not in many dimensions.

You decide where to patrol, you decide how many squadrons to engage on individual raids and (sometimes) you decide on how to engage the enemy (avoid the german hunt fighters and go for the bombers directly). And at the end of each day on the campaign you decide if you want to relinquish VPs in exchange for more planes. That's pretty much it.

Again, it's not simple and dull. But more modern designs have more different dimensions in which you have to decide on courses of action.

Be advised that my opinion is based on only three full campaign games of the Lion scenario. Maybe it's a whole different story with Eagle or the 2-player game.

Long and interesting solitaire campaign on the Battle of Britain.  Unfortunately the AI that plays against you can be gamed in a couple of situations, which can lead to easy victories.

RATING: 8
A good operational game (actually, three games in one) on the battle of Britain. Overall it's a very well designed package, with some elegant solutions to certain elements of the game (the way british green pilots are handled comes to mind). Unfortunately, it can still be a bit procedurally intensive, particularly the Eagle game, and doesn't avoid the common problem with solitaire games of getting repetitive.

Overall it's a very enjoyable experience, and it can provide some very tense moments. This should be particularly true of the 2-player variant, which I haven't played yet. Otherwise, both solo variants are quite good (in fact it's one of the best solitaire games I've played), although from my experience so far it seems a bit too easy to win.

Straight in at a rating of 10.  Unbelievable value for money giving me 3 games for the price of one.  The rules are not too complex and give the right level of decision making.

A brilliant update to [b]RAF[/b], already one of my favorite games!

The new version improves the historical simulation, adds a 2 player version, and the ability to play solo as the Luftwaffe. These improvements do add more fiddly stuff that may put off casual gamers, but wargamers and BoB enthusiasts should enjoy the enhanced realism of the new [b]RAF: The Battle of Britain 1940[/b].

Excellent refined treatment of the Battle of Britain. The original version was solo for the British. This one you can play solo either side or 2 player for both sides. As a solo British game it's a lot of fun, giving you a game where your decisions matter, but which uses a lot of tables to give you a really authentic experience. B17 done right.

Love the original RAF.  Will pick this up since you can play both sides which is a cool concept!  :thumbsup:
It just arrived!  6/12/09.  
So far have played the Eagle intro. scenario.  Like the mechanics and the game has eliminated the one major problem I had with the old version: the all or nothing combat approach.  The varied squadron results  are a great improvement! :cool:
This is one of those rare games that improves on the original which was a fantastic game to begin with!  While I admit that I have only played the Eagle portion of the game thus far, the basic mechanics are greatly improved upon from the original.  I was wondering how the new version would measure up and it has delivered in a big way! :thumbsup:  To me, this version of RAF is like listening to Jimi Hendrix's version of All Along the Watchtower: a souped up version of the original tune with a flavor and style all its own. :cool:   And yes, it IS better than the original!  Yes, I know that sounds like blasphmey :blush: but 'tis true!        

Update: The changes in this version of RAF are indeed good, but I am beginning to wonder about the strength of some of the approach and target events.  They appear to heavily favor the British, and are taking some of the fun out of the game! :shake: :angry:  While I still need to try the Lion version, I am beginning to wonder about the Eagle version.  Hence, I have lowered my rating some.

Further update: After getting some info from the designer concerning my concers (can I phrase that that way :what: ) and making a, IMO, critcal adjustment in my strategy, things are looking up! :thumbsup:  Perhaps I jumped the gun on my raising of the issues I found, but I think that was just from the level of frustration I was feeling at the time.  Now that I've made the adjustment, the game has, once again, that old RAF grind'em out feeling where it is tense and both sides are feeling the pain!  :cool:

RATING: 8.5
Played through the Lion beginner scenario and The Hardest Day, performing indifferently in both.

At that point, I felt the game lacked atmosphere, and seemed to be a little to reliant on luck - but many games are, no? The Luftwaffe is so strong early on and so it's tough to win, as least that is what I perceived.

Then I played a Lion campaign game and this for me is where the game really comes to life. I played with all advanced rules bar night bombing. In the early days I hung on as the Luftwaffe pummeled the airfields and there were times when I thought the RAF would buckle. Nerve-jangling stuff.

Nothing like having 11 Group's sectors all but empty as Time Advance is 0 and another raid is coming in! Then I managed to get a couple of Ace squadrons, and as time advanced past 1 September, more chance of Altitude Advantages in combat. Suddenly things don't look so bad.

Tried to attrit the German fighters, sometimes sending lop-sided mega formations up to meet small numbers of them on minor raids. Had some woeful dice rolls early on which almost made me lose heart, but then the tide and the dice began to turn. And thank goodness for the Delayed Response rule which allows you to sacrifice bombing damage to send more planes to meet the enemy.

Another thing which saved me was when I was at my lowest ebb, target cards started sending the bombers against deeper targets and more against LF3's sector, and so just when the targeting the south coast's airfields was on the verge of ending my resistance, the Luftwaffe changed target priorities - a real narrative was being played out through the cards and rules, wow.

And so in 2 glorious days in September I destroyed the Luftwaffe as a fighting force. Once they reached Depletion Level 1 the tide had turned, and then on 8th September, RAID DAY 8, I administered the coup de grace. From 12+ to 35+ in one heady day as the Luftwaffe crumpled. This had been helped by being at Depletion Level 2 and the fact that a whole lot of their fighters were stuck in Light and Heavy Losses.

I think you can tell that I like this game. Really good solo game, includes tension, a narrative (in the Campaign Game). Tactics do have an effect, although dice and cards can undo them, which is what you want. I now want to try Lion again, and then try Eagle (the German solo campaign).

Heartily recommend.

LION - RAF solo

This is much more balanced than I first estimated.  

I played the campaign game and it ended very near the historical end date. You need the VPs from the passing days and the first four raid days can take you a long way into negative VPs.

EAGLE - Luft solo

I really like the feel of this part of the game.  Unfortunately I think it may be unbalenced.
 
I played the campaign game and won in the first four raid days.  By defending each raid with a sizable contingent of fighters the RAF can become depleted in an extremely short time span.

I will try again with the campaign that does require deeper raids straight away.

This is certainly the best game I've purchased this year.  Superbly illustrated.  High quality components.  Lots of value (3 games- two of them solitaire!).  But, let's not leave it at that.  Fun, challenging, not overly complex, and well researched and amazingly recreates the feel of those dark days of 1940.  Not only am I addicted to this game- my son won't even let me get to it.  I missed this game the first time around, but the wait was worth it!

I really want to like this game a lot. It is well thought out and addresses many realistic themes from the actual campaign. But I'm finding Lion to easy to win with the advanced rules. I just confidently stay with the RAF plan. I.e., patiently inflict losses on Luftwaffe that will eventually the deplete the Luftwaffe past the point of being able to recover while avoiding losses to the RAF. I.e., either pounce heavily on a raid or leave it alone completely. Stress-free RAF victory seems assured with patience.

For the Lion game only (where you are the RAF). Clever yet accessible solitaire game. Most of the gameflow is determined for you, yet there's little in the way of AI management to burden the player - most raids are over in 10 minutes and you (often) have decisions to make throughout. As with any good solitaire game, the story elements and tension are great, especially when you start running out of squadrons to put in the air and are hoping desperately for a minor raid with a single ME109 (and hoping *against* a minor raid that suddenly becomes a six-gruppen fighter sweep). 

I found the Eagle game (where you play the Luftwaffe) to be interesting from a historical standpoint, but boring to play out as all of your decisions get made at the start of the day and then they simply play out for the next couple of hours. That may scratch an itch for some, but not so much for me. I would find the 2-player game interesting only if I played the RAF. However, I'd rather have the games in the box than not, and the component quality is far better than in the original WEG version, so this update was well worth the price.

The best solitaire game I have found. It allows two people to play, which I have never done. It also allows a person to play either the Luftwaffe or the RAF in the battle of Britain with several scenarios and the grand campaign. The longest campaign takes a few days to a week to get through. Each time I have played this game it has felt different.

I enjoy that you can play solo 2 different games out of the box (and also have a 3rd 2 player game included, but haven't tried yet). Instead of having the one game and adapting it or yourself for solo/multiplayer game and being one side focused you have 3 separate games with similar rules and such so easy to transition from one to the other.

The rules can be a bit iffy, I highly do recommend getting the fan made 'Flipbooks' (hosted here on BBG) they really do help get into the game quicker and start playing.

Game play is ok, if you can call it 'game play'. You pretty much just follow instructions and watch the game play out. You dont really get that big 'battle of Britain' feel out of it.

The biggest gripe I have with the game is the counters.
The images and colours are great but some of the printed numbers and letters on there are printed quite small and hard to see and it doesn't help the fact that the counters where 'off-cut', so some of the letters/numbers are sliced on the edge making it even harder.
They where also not cut all the way through, I had to re-cut them with a sharp blade (carefully) to get them all apart.
Other then that, the maps (yes 2 maps) are great, the cards are nice, I did replace the dice (some of the 'dots' on one of them where not coloured in like the rest), the 'chart/aid' card-sheets are a bit flimsy, but work fine (and are not glossy, yay!!)

The 'Battle Of Britain' really was our 'finest hour' and this is a brilliant game which really captures that period of 1940 when 'the few' defended 'this sceptred isle' against the Nazi war machine. It helps the theme for me that I live on the South Coast which saw such drama unfold overhead. 

In the early '80's I had a 'Battle of Britain' game on my Sinclair Spectrum. You sent squadrons of Spitfires and Hurricanes up to intercept the Luftwaffe raids based on their last known Radar positions. Sometimes you found them, sometimes you didn't. It was a really enjoyable game for the lowly Spectrum and this board game takes the theme to new levels.

While innovative and seemingly a decent, playable simulation, it just seemed too repetitive for me to want to play again after winning my first campaign.  It is basically a series of educated guesses followed by card draws and die rolls.

This rating is provisional, and I've only played the Lion version so far.  I'm disappointed with the Lion game.  I find it very repetative, with few interesting decisions to be made.  Every turn looks pretty much like the last.  There is little sense of a story arc, and little long term planning is possible, you are mostly just reacting to what the German does.  You look at the planes available and any advance warning you have, distribute planes accordingly while usually leaving a few planes for the next round, see what happens, rinse and repeat.  Playing advanced rules with aces and delayed response helps, but it isn't enough.

A game like D-Day at Omaha beach is better because the situation is changing as the game progresses.  Thus, win or lose, there is a nice story arc.  Turns feel different as the game progressses.  

I hope the RAF eagle will be better.

Well designed solo game for The battle of Britain.  It is heavily scripted, and by that I mean the majority of the time the game plays itself.  The heart of the RAF player's decision making is choosing what squadrons to send on patrol.  Probably one of the better combat results table I've ever used.  So far I have just played the RAF solo, looking forward to trying it solo with the Luftwaffe.

I can't think of any way to improve on how this game handles the RAF's challenges and strengths.
Can be frustrating, as it absolutely should be, followed by a period of relief.  

Read up on the Battle of Britain before buying this game and you will understand why it is implemented this way.  A casual observer might find it confusing and unfair at times though.

I believe you must understand the BoB in order to get full enjoyment from RAF:TBoB 1940.

Wanted to like it. But unfortunately after trying Burning Blue I cannot go back to RAF. I know that they are different scale, but Burning Blue creates tension of campaing for me much better. RAF is too much abstract for me - Raid resolution is too boring.

Overall I had feeling that there were almost no meaningful decisions during my plays. I have played once Lion game and once tried 2 player which was even worse in this regard as neither of us did enjoy it.

If I look on game strictly from perspective of resource management in this view only it is interesting game.

It is an awesome solo play experience. The depth in srategy, the crucial decisions you have to make, the unexpected events, the roll of the dices, everything is absolutely fantastic. So far is my ultimate solo playing experience in a "leader of the army level". B 17 is my other ultimate solo experience in a "rpg platoon level"

Aquired Dec 2016. Only tried RAF Lion. The game does have it's limitations (once 'solved' it becomes much easier), however, with good house rule (double German bombing VPs on unimtercepted raids) looks like the best solo game I've played so far.

Outstanding game engine that simulates numerous aspects of Battle of Brittain in very authentic way. One thing I don't like is fact that game doesn't provide You many decissions to make. You bassicaly go on rails through whole raid days procedure using dice/charts&cards to created german raids, then decide which Spits&Hurricanes You want to have in the air, and based on that "lucky guess" decision You manage your available aircrafts to engage raids. Then you go into dice&charts combat, and that's it. Rinse and repeat.

This is a superb game. You never know how many raids you are getting each day, and the system works brilliantly, whether it is to frustrate you, by making you patrol lots of squadrons against very few raids, or draining your resources with raid after raid.
Scoring works well, every game I have played so far has been very different.
With the German and two player variants included, this is a total winner.
One of the best solitaire games you can buy (and it has the bonus of the 2 player option!)

RATING: 6
A good simulation of the raid planning and attritional campaign strategy of Battle of Britian.  I've only played the solitare version (from the German side, RAF: Eagle).  It has a feel much like Compass Games' solitaire submarine games (e.g. Silent War).  There is a lot of card and chart work running each raid, but it flows fairly fast once you get used to the mechanics.  Also as in Silent War you get the feeling that you're pounding away at a some vast random engine that is only partially impacted by your tactics and strategy.  Yeah, you can die fast by doing something dumb, but brilliance only slowly gets you somewhere.  Tension in a 2-player game would help a lot.

One of the best solo games I've ever played. The only problem with the game is that it's to easy to win once you figured out the optimal strategy. A solo game should be harder to beat than this and that is why I give it an 8. If the game were more challenging I would give it a higher rating.

I really liked the first raid day I played. The second day was exactly like the first and I gave up after that. While there is a certain flow to the game, it's lacking any kind of 'development', story arch or anything like it. Maybe I have not played enough days, as the Battle of Britain was a war of attrition, but I really could not bring myself to play the 3rd day :(

I will certainly give it another go, but the first impression left a bitter aftertaste.

---
Okay, corrected my score one up. This _is_ a battle of attrition and it takes 3-4 raid days to actually see the impact and difference your actions make. It also heavily depends on your luck in the first one or two days. If you get a lot of 0-time advance cards you will have a hard time; 2-hour advances, combined with 3-day advances make life really easy. 

I had more fun this time; completed a game of Lion in 3-4 hours and had complete Luftwaffe destruction in the first week of September. 

---- 

Corrected my score again, it goes up again. It is a really interesting game -- it gets better the more often I play it. Also it's a game I keep thinking about once in a while. Setup is quick and the mechanics get easier and more automatic after a while.

RATING: 6
The Battle of Britain presents unique opportunities for game design. The experience of the RAF Fighter Controllers over their plotting boards was already halfway to a board "game" in the way it abstracted key elements of the air battle raging overhead. Butterfield ports these elements to specific systems in his game. For example, the Tote Board displaying squadron readiness status serves precisely the same function here. 

There's one exception, however. While in the real operations rooms the map was the absolute focal point of people's attention, I agree with the poster above who points to its curiously subordinate function in the game. Players miss out on the tension of raids inching ever closer as the plots are updated. Likewise, the fact that the game system does not accommodate simultaneous raids (it abstracts them by not advancing the time clock) also dilutes some of the tension. In the end, I find a lot of the game is taken up with pulling cards and counters, and relatively little with decision making. (That said, I've only played the intro Lion scenario, so that might well change once one gets into replacements, reinforcements, and shifting targeting and strategic priorities. Hence no rating yet.)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Clever and well thought out.  The key mechanics all click with my reading of the history.  I enjoyed Eagle more than Lion, as setting the raids seemed more challenging and interesting than responding to randomly generated ones. I'd like to play the two-player game sometime as well.  No matter how clever the solitaire systems are, a game against another player would be great.

Brilliant macro level game.  As the Brits you just have to outlast the Germans until the fall of 1940 when they run out of time to invade Britain.  Holding back fighter units is how you wait out the Germans, but it's counterintuitive since you are forced to sacrifice the frontline fighter units by willingly sending them forth at less than full strength. This also means you are going to take more damage than you want to critical facilities. But you have to preserve the RAF...

Fantastic game. The map sheets are a little thin, and the rules/player aids could do with some colour. The counters are clear and easy to read though. The rules are relatively easy for a newcomer like me to follow. Once I'd played through a turn or two, it all started to come together nicely. Compelling game play - I really got hooked and found myself going to bed late, after "just one more raid". It seemed quite straightforward initially, but there is a fair bit of strategic depth in how the player manages replacements/losses as well as in disposing of forces to meet raids over a period of time. Highly recommended for solitaire play!

Another great game by John Butterfield. The game system is very polished and requires the player to make A LOT of decisions throughout the campaign. 

The components are sadly a litle subpar. With better counters and a mounted board, this would be the only game I would ever need.

RATING: 8.5
Fairly simple solo game that you can breeze through in a few hours. It definitely captures my attention better than most other solo games I've played. But... it's sometimes less than fulfilling to realize that you're playing against a dumb system, rather than an intelligent opponent.

This is especially true when playing the Eagle (German) module. That role is all about planning and bluffing: get the British player to over-commit to the small raids and under-commit to the large raids. And the AI will certainly do that, but there isn't the satisfaction of having outsmarted an equal opponent.

Haven't tried the 2-Player module, but that may likely satisfy the game's short-comings.

The Battle of Britain is one of the turning points of World War Two.  Having just evacuated what was left of their army off the European mainland, the British were isolated and facing a possible invasion from Hitler’s forces.  Before the Nazi forces could land however they had to neutralize any defences that could hinder their progress.  This would lead to the massive bombing campaign launched by the Germans, and what would become known as The Battle of Britain.

Designed by John H Butterfield, ‘RAF: The Battle of Britain 1940’ gives you the chance to defend British skies from the Nazi bombing raids in the ‘Lion’ scenario but also play the other side in the ‘Eagle’ scenario.  There is also a two player head-to-head game if you don’t feel like playing solo.  (This review is primarily about the ‘Lion’ scenario.)

Like many solo games the game play is quite process heavy.  There is a clear order in which things must be done and it can take a while for this to sink in, but once it does the game begins to flow nicely and you can concentrate on your tactics.  When playing the ‘Lion’ scenario the German actions are determined by decks of cards.  These cards tell you where the attacks are headed, how severe the raid is, and what planes will be flying in the raid.  The British response is determined by what sort of intelligence they have received about the raid, and how early they received it.  When you have accurate and very early intelligence you can scramble more squadrons to meet the threat, but poor and late information finds you committing squadrons before you know anything about the raid.  (This is one of the places the game can get very tense.)

The ‘Lion’ scenario is a constant balancing act.  You need to balance the needs of meeting the current raid against the need to husband your forces for future raids.  Keeping in mind planes can’t stay in the sky forever, and need to land, re-fuel, re-arm and repair.  This can keep planes from participating for a number of raids depending on what has happened to them.

This is where the design shines in my opinion.  There is a real tension and it requires a bit of thought and some calculated risk at times to overcome it.  Do you push your lightly damaged fighters to chase after the bombers, or do you get them fixed for future battles?  Do you scramble fighters from neighbouring sectors (and if so how many), or do you let the limited number of squadrons in the sector handle it?  And so on.

To someone watching all this it may seem like you spend your time turning over cards and moving counters and then rolling dice without much happening.  But they would be wrong!  As well as being a brain burner, this is a story game.  I got a real sense of a narrative as I sent my plucky squadrons against the hordes attacking them, and every loss was a blow.

As you can probably tell by now I enjoyed playing the ‘Lion’ scenario.  There is lots of re-playability just in this one scenario without trying the others which suggests that there is a lot of game in this box.  The game also gave me an appreciation of the job done co-ordinating the defence during the battle.  I can only imagine how nerve wracking the actual battle was.  So in summation, a great game that makes you think and deserves to be played multiple times.  In other words a keeper.

RAF is genuinely excellent. If you look at my review of the original game, I had many reservations about its history. In this game John has addressed many of my criticisms head-on and done a brilliant job of reforging the system.

Though I have some quibbles with the historicity of the Eagle and Lion vs. Eagle scenarios, which seem to generate too many raids of too great a strength, the overhaul has fixed a great number of problems with the original game model. The Lion scenario is close to spot-on as a piece of history and it even models the stabilization scheme, which I regard as a remarkable achievement.

Though it is expensive I think this is a great value-for-money game and give it a hearty thumbs up.

Great game with a gripping narrative, but not the same depth of decision making as D-Day at Omaha Beach. This is why I cannot rate it as highly. Resolving raids is fun and the swings of fortune make for an engaging playing experience but there isn't much diversity. Event cards provide some uncertainty when resolving raids, but these are drawn once squadrons have been committed. On the plus side, the game provides a really compelling commentary on the Battle of Britain and the campaign game evolves nicely so that the RAF slowly wrestles control of the skies from the Luftwaffe. I feel sure that I will enjoy playing this for many years to come. It is an easier game to win than D-Day, so if I can't face being put through the wringer then I think I'll be more likely to turn to this. There is, however, still enough challenge that successes are worth celebrating.

Eagle is rather dull by comparison to Lion. Far fewer decisions and way too easy to win. I also have less emotional investment on the other side of the Channel so I think I'll be sticking to Lion.

Learning the game by following the sequence of play was very easy. Setup and played first scenario in a couple of hours. Nearly everything you need is on the map, not much need to refer to the rules (although I would have preferred the rules numbers came with the sequence of play).
The gameflow is fine and becomes very fast intuitive.

Solitaire doesn't get any better than this. What sets this BoB game apart from others I've played (computer or board) is the realism that (as the German player, at least) you aren't in charge of everything. Big-picture target priorities aren't your call; those come from Berlin.

This is a fantastic solitaire game.  It is actually 2 solitaire games in one box AND a 2 player version as well.  The system is very easy to get into and most of the important charts are on the map.  Only for combat do you need to reference any player aid's.

I've only played the British thus far, but really enjoy the decision making process.  The 'AI' is nicely streamlined with a good variation due to the cards so the replay value is endless.  You really do not know what to expect and you have to prepare for everything.  I have not played a solitaire board game in about 20 years until I stumbled upon this title.  The design of this game has made me reconsider solitaire gaming.

As far as solitaire games go....this is a true classic!
However to get the very best narrative from this game ,you really have to play the entire battle,which can take a long time.(12 hrs)
Like all solitaires, it can become repetitive...
I have yet to find an opponent ,but must say that it is slightly more enjoyable playing the Eagle and planning those raid days!

RAF, both editions, are my favorite historical solitaire play . . . and not by a little.

The new RAF is great in that it updates the graphics and introduces two new games:  RAF Eagle (German Solitaire) as well as 1 v. 1 play.

Both this edition and the original rules are the gold standard when it comes to clarity and taking the player step-by-step through the game play.

Conversational and heavy paragraph formats of today's rules do not hold a candle to RAF.

My only quibble is that it is fairly easy to master the strategies for victory in solo play.

Mr. Butterfield and everyone involved with this design, thanks for making this game!!!! A true labor of love!!!!

The Old West End version of RAF was one of my favorite games. When Decision Games announced they were publishing a new version, I was more interested in getting it because my WE edition was worn and showing some age. John Butterfield did some fine tuning and made the game even better which I didn't think was possible. There is a bit more detail in the phases of where the squadrons go light & heavy loss, re-arming, landing. It feels like one is managing the RAF. I like how replacment points are used in repairing light & heavy damaged squads. Also the British player has to worry about having experienced pilots as well as replacements. I like how one can get (or lose) victory points for light losses. A big plus is that one can play the Luftwaffe side and two can play it. One of the downside for me was there is so much infromation on the counters now I have a hard time reading them.

Outstanding game.  So far only two Lion solitaire scenarios played.  It took a while to get comfortable with the rules and the flow science I usually play hex and counter games.

The game is exciting and tense, especially when the majority of Spitfires and Hurricanes in sectors are in the landing and rearming box and there's a potential for an incoming or follow up raid.

This game has high replay value for me.

Really nice strategic game. Still need to play it a bit more though to rate it correctly. But so far the only thing rating it down is the quality of the map (paper map).

Im so torn about this game. It is a great game that is good and addictive BUT the combat section is imho bad. The fact that you need the complex chart where you first add numbers to get a collumn and then roll a dice to use a chart in that collumn is just horrible. The chart is too complex to learn by heart so you need to reference it on each and every dice roll. This totally breaks immersion for me.

I learned to really like solo games during my wife's pregnancy.  I especially like historical war games.  Just reading the rules and exploring the history is really satisfying.

Plenty of tension, and all the fun of the original.

The fact that it can be played from both sides solitaire, as well as two-player adds a lot of value.  Bonus points for the originality of this alone.

This qualification refers to Eagle only. I have played 3 campaign games. I have won by decisive victory in the three games, always before 1th September day. I'm sure that I have played correctly (with advanced rules).
I think that I.A of RAF is weak, and this fact in a solitaire game is important. Is necessary a revision of RAF I.A.
The system game is good and fun. But the weak I.A is a critical handicap for a good note to Eagle game.

There goes the siren that warns of the air raid, then comes the sound of the guns sending flak, out for the scramble we've got to get airborne, got to get up for the coming attack. Grueling and difficult decisions at every turn. Elegant board, minimalist art.

Just given it my first play. It was cut short by the horrible layout of the rulebook, map, and player aids. I expect to enjoy this game more as I get used to it.

One of the best treatments I've seen for this battle.  I really like the fact that you can play either side solo with the F2F an added bonus.

Really enjoyed this at first, but after completing the campaign scenario, it lost some luster as it gets pretty repetitive.  Would love to play this 2-player though as I think that could really make for a fun and interesting experience.

Superb game - a must companion game for D-DAY Omaha Beach. I seriously can't wait to get this back to the table and try out various strategies and bomber configurations. I have only played as the Germans at this time so the replayablility in this title is immense. Just a fantastic solo game design and a must for any serious WWII solo board gamer. 

UPDATE: played Lion... major victory on first Sea Lion check. Will have to play it again to see if I fee like others have mentioned - that Lion is to easy to win.

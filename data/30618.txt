I prefer over Telestrations because I want the ability for detail a pencil or pen gives me, not a big fan of the markers.

RATING: 10
Played with the right group, this game is absolutely hilarious.  I think this may replace Time's Up! as my favourite party game.

After six plays, this is definitely the hardest I've ever laughed playing a game.  I think I need to make a place in my Top 10.

Update : Several more plays this Xmas with family.  Never laughed so hard.  Love this game.

I don't get where the name comes from since it's Pictionary meets Broken Telephone.  The game has also been commercially published under 'Telestrations' and 'Cranium Scribblish'.

We call it paper pictionary, which granted, is not as evocative as EPYC.  This is great non-competitive party game.  Tried a boxed version of this game with scoring at Dan's a while back.  I think it was called Telestrations or something, but frankly, I think the original is more fun, since the whole point of the game is to have a good laugh.

RATING: 9
One of my favorite choices for party games.  

The game is completely non-competitive, but still very engaging as you have to make sense of the sentence/picture each round and provide your own interpretation of it.  A little creativity and drawing ability helps, but being a terrible artist can be equally funny.

There's a great payoff at the end and lots of laughs as each person reads through their work.

As far as creativity, rules simplicity, and cost ($0), this game is hard to beat for a party game. Sober, or less than sober, this game allows for a beautifully collaborative trainwreck. Couples tend to pick up on each others strange humor and it can be just as weird when the chain of concepts doesn't entirely jump the track.

It's a party game, so it's not really my cup of tea. There's no winner at the end, so what's the purpose of playing? Well, this is pure FUN! It should have 10 for the fun, 1 for the (un-)game... so, it's a 5.5...!

7/10 for an activity

+ a way to learn what is in the heads of your friends
- this should be in the Outside the Scope of BGG

Honestly, this may be my favorite party game.  I can't bring myself to buy Telestrations when this only requires paper and pencils.

Update: an advantage this has over Dixit is that it also rewards creativity and appeals to creative people, yet it doesn't punish those who aren't as creative.  Drawing a crude picture is not as intimidating to a very left-brained, introverted person as having to come up with a "story" is.

It really doesn't get much better than this for a party game, and it's free!  Basically, what we have here is a game of telephone, where the game starts with a sentence.  The sentence is passed to the next player who draws a picture based on the sentence.  The paper is passed again and again, alternating sentences and pictures.  At the end, the whole progression of sentences/pictures is revealed and hilarity ensues as the story takes wacky turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Funny little party game where all you need is some paper and pencil.  I like to use the player aid here in the geek.  Use the 4 player one for 8 players and write below each dotted line and then draw below that.  That definitely seemed to work for us.  Quick little 15 minute game.

RATING: 8
More of an activity than a proper "game", but so what? This has infinite replayabilty and is literally always funny. Seriously, I want to meet the person who played this and didn't laugh. And it's like the only drawing game where not being able to draw just makes it [i]even funnier.[/i] I'm terrible at drawing and in fact, have always hated drawing and this game routinely makes me laugh to the point of tears. If that's not a ringing endorsement then I don't know what is.

Update: Now available in a commercial form as Telestrations - have to admit I'm sort of interested in the whiteboard notebooks (though I do have some of our "best ofs" saved - I'd miss that aspect!), but why on earth would they make it one word only? I love that this game starts off funny [i]right off the bat[/i] when people start by passing you a really weird sentence.

I've played this several times and it went down well with both gamers and non-gamers. 7 or 9 seems to be about right as you can start and end with the writing and there's enough scope for change in between. With the right crowd this game is a hoot. And it's free!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Some friends taught us this (as "Telephone Pictionary") last year, and now we've taught it to a couple of other groups. We love it!  Great for older kids too. And the more people, the better.

One note-- we play it how we learned it-- instead of one large paper folder over, we all start with X number of index-card-sizes of cut copier paper, with X being number of players in the game.  Using one large paper would cut down on the paper confusion and chaos in the game, so we'll have to try it that way sometime.

One of my favorite games for big groups of people that want to play a game, but aren't there specifically for gaming (such as family get-togethers). One great thing about it is it tends to work well with a wide range of people, and is almost always really funny. The one thing I've experienced that made it less enjoyable is if a player tries to influence the next player with their drawing or description, rather than purely drawing or describing what they received.

If the old game of Telephone had a baby with Pictionary, this would be the result.  And that result is far more enjoyable and 10 times more hilarious than its predecessors!

Considering you just need pen, paper and imagination, you can't go wrong with this party game.  I've played using just nouns, verbs, phrases, you name it.  It all works.  Especially fun with a mixed group getting to know each other - you'll become comfortable sharing very quickly!

I understand Telestrations is an attempt to box this game up and make money off it, but I'll be fine just going with this unboxed version.

I played this game as a kid in high school so I know it around before 1990.  It should be dated at least 1986.  We didn't have a name for it back then, but we played it a lot along with Fictionary (Balderdash) and Pictionary.  I think I learned how to play it in English class.

(Commercialised as "Telestrations")

Pen-and-paper activity, perfect for post-dinner for a creative group.  Takes perhaps 15 minutes for a 9 player game.

Great for fun-loving non-gamers.  You don't have to be able to draw - in fact it's funnier if you can't.  Short rounds and negligible teaching time make it yet more useful.  

Home-brew is far better than the store-bought "Telestrations". Though the latter has nice components, it ties the game to a max of 8 players (at least with the UK version) and the markers don't allow resolution to sketch a detailed scene (fine for the single-word topics that telestrations provides).

Some suggest you use the cards from the awful "Cards Against Humanity" as the starting sentences.  I'd give a creative group more freedom.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Anyone with a pencil and paper can add this to their collection if they so choose.  And they certainly should choose to, because it's probably the funniest game ever conceived.  

That said, you have to play this game with imaginative people.  Trying to play it with a rather stolid family member was an absolute drag.

We play this game a ton under the moniker "Telephone Pictionary." Gets especially good after drinking and if the group has any running jokes to riff on. We've also used Cards Against Humanity cards as starting points for people who are stumped (or daft).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The absolute best party game. You can play it with just paper and pencil and you can include everyone no matter how much they like games. And best of all - it's always a riot

Best with 6-10

RATING: 6.5
This is difficult to rate - it has the potential to be incredibly funny, but many of the papers turn out to be only mildly amusing. I would definitely play this once in a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
All you need are pencils and paper for a hysterically fantastic time. A Pictionary take on the game Telephone, everybody starts writing some ordinary sentence on their paper, and then passes it to their right. Each player then draws a picture attempting to describe the sentence. Each paper is folded to hide the original sentence, and each paper is passed to the right. The next player writes their interpretation of the picture as a sentence. This continues until each paper returns to the original owner. The way each original sentence is mangled into something completely different is hilarious. It is also fascinating to see one or two sentences return intact. Great party game that is scalable, but is probably good with 7 or 8.

RATING: 8.1
Jun08: Who'd have thought this could be so much fun?  It really is a great party game that's sure to draw some laughs.The actual game is very similar to "Telephone"; the game where kids whisper a message across a room and see how garbled the interpretation becomes.  In EPYC, you pass a stack of papers and alternate turning a phrase into a picture and turning a picture into a phrase.There's nothing competitive about it, but the absurd illustrations and interpretations make for just a great time.

Okay so I thought with such a ridiculous name this must be a cheesefest, and I see now it isnt much of game really and will grow old fast but after reading Morgan's comment, it looks like I have to try it...

"I can't imagine my parents thinking shoving a penis through Hitler's head would be all that funny, so your mileage may vary"

Update:  Okay so after playing "Telestrations" I'll have to try this now...LOL.  Great game Tele was and could be better not sure, its a simplified (two or three words only) commercial version of this which I've played with several groups and all loved it. This one would probably have even more creativity allowed it with whole sentences and rarely have something make it around the table in comparison, will have to try.

Everyone "owns" Eat Poop You Cat, but I wanted to comment on it here. This is the best party game you will ever play... and it costs pennies per play. You might think, "I'm not creative enough to play this," but you'd be wrong. The less creative you are, and the worse you draw, the more fun everyone else will have with your creations. I laugh until I cry every time I play this game. Play it once, then throw away all your other party games.

This is a paper verion of "Humor Rumor", when you seed the rumor then pass it to everyone to see what comes out.  A lot of the humor here comes from misinterpretation of handwriting and artwork, at least from the photos of past games that are posted here.

The level of fun involved depends entirely upon the circumstances. Sometimes delivers a solid 9 on the hilarity scale, but sometimes churns out a pathetic 3 on the fun scale. It's very dependent on who the players are, as anyone would expect from this type of game.

Excellent party game.  I learned it as 'Telephone Pictionary.'  We always played with books of paper stapled together and an odd number of people (~11 was ideal) so you always start and end with a phrase.  And then pass the books around so everyone can see them.
I guess its not exactly a game as much as an activity, as there are no winners and losers, but its a guaranteed silly laughing fun hit.

Game in a Nutshell: A fun game of imagination and mis-communication. Start by writing a sentence, pass to the next person who draws a picture of your sentence. Pass it along again after folding over all but the most recent addition. Continue; sentence, picture, sentence, picture, etc. then stop and see how far things have digressed.

Played as: 8,10 player

Pros: There's no part of this game that doesn't tickle me. From seeing what I've been tasked with upon having a paper passed to me, to making some awful scribbles only to anticipate how the next person will interrupt it, and finally the overall hilarity as game comes to a close and you get to look at the picture as a whole. And all you need to play is pencils and paper.

Cons: Scrounging up enough pencils is always a pain. People sometimes draw at different speeds which can cause bottle-necks in the progression of play. Should be played with a certain amount of flair in order to be good, so flair-less should avoid.

Other: I'm a self-professed hater of all games 'party.' But this is one party game I would jump at the chance to play anytime. Add that distinction to a list that only contains Werewolf and Curses and you have my three go to party games.

Best Use: Good party game for that 7-10 player range where it's too many for an ordinary game, but just shy of good Werewolf numbers.

The only reason I'm rating this so low is because a) like most party games the enjoyment of EPYC will be based on your player's involvement, creativity, and willingness to look ridiculous, and b) it's not really a game, it's just Exquisite Corpse with a twist.

But if you don't find SOME enjoyment out of this game, something's wrong.  The last game we played featured the immortal lines "I sold Grandma's body to pursue my dreams" and "The yo-yo burglar stopped to look at himself in the mirror and wish for hair."

This is a fun party activity with no winners or losers, but is side-splittingly hilarious each time I've played.

I can see the appeal, sort of.  However, this is more of an activity than a game.

Surprisingly better than expected, but still flawed.  Kind of like the telephone game, but with pictures.  Unfortunately, it's a bit of a logistical nightmare to keep the game going for more than a few rounds without running out of paper or having previous rounds accidentally revealed.  And, honestly, I don't think anyone would have even noticed or suggested this game if it didn't have "poop" in the title . . . *sigh*

I have yet to introduce this to a group of people and regret it.  Without fail it has produced a great time, with everyone crouded around laughing so hard they almost come to tears.  The nice thing about his drawing based game is that you don't have to be a good drawer to enjoy the game, in fact, some of the games most inspired moments will likely come from the worst drawers in the group ;)

One thing I have noticed about this game is it tends to make people hesitent, the kind of people that aren't sure if they want to be silly, etc.  I've had to goad people into joining the group on more then one occasion, but they are usually glad they did.

Try playing it with naughty starting sentences for even more fun! ;)

Paper Telephone is my favorite "party" game, even though it's really more of an activity than a game. I'm yet to play a round of this where at least one person didn't end up in hysterics by the end.

God knows where the ridiculous cat-poop name comes from - it seems to be on Wikipedia (referencing BGG) and on BGG (referencing Wikipedia). I can't help but feel someone's pulled off prank that's being reinforced by this (rant over!).

This is a great party game - have also played at work as a team-building exercise.

It is difficult to play with people who tend to be extremely practical - if they start focusing too much on getting the exact picture or sentence and not letting themselves think outside the box, they'll miss out on the fun.

This is an amazing party game -- my family calls it the "foldy paper game" and adds an additional twist.  Instead of one person writing the first sentence, the first person writes a noun phrase (the lumpy stew, the irresponsible grandmother, an unsettling bust of Abraham Lincoln....), folds their paper and passes it to the next player, who writes a verb phrase (couldn't dance to save its life, walked on the surface of the moon, defeated the Khan in single combat.)  This makes for even weirder sentences.

This, on the other hand, had the table raucously laughing with the game. It's simple yet ingenious concept. Each participant writes a sentence at the top of a piece of paper and passes it to the left. Then each player draws a picture attempting to depict the sentence, and folds the sheet of paper such that only the drawing is visible, and passes to the left again. Now each player writes a sentence explaining/interpreting what is in the drawing, folds the paper so only this second sentence is visible, and passes to the left. This continues until everyone gets back the sheet of paper they started with. Then you unfold all of the sheets and read them aloud and look through them together. Much hilarity ensues. I can't believe I'd never played this game before, but it takes the idea of Telephone to a whole new and improved level. This is a party game that I can definitely recommend.

Cherries are sad, a rectangle explodes, and a turtle gets naked. If you are confused, you obviously haven't played this game. (Well, even if you have, you're probably still lost.) :) I have played this many times, and can't remember a round where I didn't bust out laughing. This game is responsible for some of the funniest moments in board gaming, and probably life in general. As a party game, the only downside of Eat Poop You Cat is that you will probably pee yourself from laughing so hard.

Quite hilarious, especially if you have creative people in your group.  It's deceptively simple, and the amusement of getting your own mangled sentence back is amazing.  Somewhat time consuming.  I'm not really sure that this is a game.  I'd call it an activity.  However, as far as party games go, I would rather do a party activity anyway.  I wouldn't hesitate to play this if the atmosphere was right.  It's reliably funny, which is something not many other party games can claim.

RATING: 7
[b]Summary:[/b]

I use this game in any situation with a large number of players and in any situation that includes non-gamers who don't want to even temporarily try to be gamers.

+ Everyone seems to like it, at least for the first 10 or so games. It is very high interaction and causes a lot of laughter. It scales to any number of players. It works with virtually any age. It's the perfect party game.
- Someone might be embarrassed about their drawing skill. Players can choose to make the game offensive.


[b]Rules:[/b]
Very easy to remember, and very simple but a bit difficult to teach. People figure it out easily enough when they attempt to play, but I've never seen an entire group understand the rules before play starts.

[b]Components:[/b]
Any drawing/writing tools.

[b]Theme:[/b]
None.

[b]Luck:[/b]
None.

[b]Interaction:[/b]
This game has two phases: drawing what someone else wrote, guessing at what someone else drew.

[b]Strategy:[/b]
None.

[b]Tactics:[/b]
None.

[b]Analysis Paralysis:[/b]
Sometimes a huge amount of AP plagues this game. This is very rare. It usually doesn't happen even in a room with 24 participants (a player count I regularly have for this game, since I use it in college classrooms.)

[b]Difficulty:[/b]
Easy. Can ramp up for people who are not confident about drawing skills, but poor drawings are very effective, so their worries are unfounded.

[b]Length:[/b]
About 10 minutes.

[b]Replayability:[/b]
It has infinite variety, but most players do not like to play it beyond a certain number of plays without a long break.

A fun way to end the night. Write a phrase on a piece of paper and pass it to the left. That person draws a picture and then folds the paper to cover your phrase and passes it left. That person looks at the pictures and tries to guess the phrase and writes it under the picture. Then they cover your picture and pass it to the left and it keeps going until they get their page back (write your name on the bottom of your starting page). It's a lot of laughs and you can see how sick and twisted your fellow gamers truly are.

Telestrations is fun, too, but for sheer laughs, get the right people together and play this game to straight-up bust a gut.  I guess you could play it with folks who wouldn't take it into "wrong" territory, but when you're willing to take it that far, it can be a ton of fun.

Heerlijke partygame die iedere keer weer voor veel plezier zorgt. Iedere speler schrijft een zin op die zijn/haar buurman/-vrouw moet transformeren in een tekening. En dit gaat zo verder tot het weer terug is bij de oorspronkelijke schrijver.

What a hilarious party game. I have never had a bad experience with this game, and since the only requirements to play are people, paper, and pens, I can pull it out whenever I want.

The gameplay is as interesting or boring as the participants make it, but it doesn't take a creative genius to create a fantastic chain of pictures and phrases. It's also a very open-ended game that can be played for any length of time.

Honestly, this is one of the best party games around.

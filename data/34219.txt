A great game that gets played a lot on lunch break at work. Plays fast and has a good amount of card luck and strategy. Our group likes it so much we have come up with our own variants to add additional challenges.

RATING: 7
Fun and fast card game. Split into two phases - the first phase is a draft phase where you must discern your opponents' strategies and decide your own. The second phase is an auction where you try and strengthen your position. There is some randomness but the game is so short that the randomness is fun rather than frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is a great little fast game. It changes greatly from 2-4 players. I prefer 3-4 but 2 is very interesting as well. 

The theme does not shine through, but the art is beautiful and it helps make the game enjoyable. 

Game play is based around set collecting, but it is the placement and auction portions that really make the game shine. Choices are important, and determining what the really important cards to your hand to attain victory is a very sublime aspect.

Lots of game for little money. Love it.

A nice game but my wife and I aren't a huge fun of auction mechanisms in games. We prefer Steve Finn's newer title Herbaceous, which shares some similarities with Biblios but jettisons the auctions (and is more pleasing to look at).

RATING: 3
130929 I have no interest in playing this game anymore.  I think I just don't like blind bidding. Which isn't part of this game per se (or is it?) but somehow does seem to be part of the feel of the game

120218  Just played it 3P and the partial deck is starting to bug me a lot.  However, its still fun, so I haven't adjusted the rating, but now I'm getting mega conflicted about whether I like this game or not.  I suspect that it will end up staying "in the middle"

Wow small cards but packs one hell of a punch.  I've been interested in the auction mechanic for 2 players and I gotta say this game must be one of the best at doing that.  I'll most likely push the rating up once I play it a bit more.  

Update: I've played it a few more times, and I have to say I'm not sure I'm so enamored with the game anymore.  I like it well enough, but Tichu is a big favorite in my gaming group and since I like climbing mechanics....that and RA has kind of taken care of my 2P auction fix.

Interesting mechanic of drawing three cards, one at a time, and making a decision where to put the cards as drawn. A smidge of "press your luck" mixed with some strategic options for planning the endgame. All in all, a nice filler, but the cards are stiff, hard to shuffle, and smell horrid.

Card sleeves are mandatory for this title. With more plays, I expect to revise my rating -- most likely HIGHER, if I had to guess.

RATING: 8
20+ plays / 2,3,4 players

LIKE: Quick, very fun and competitive. Feels like a stock game more than an auction game. Love the partial-knowledge mechanism. Deeper game than it looks.
DISLIKE: Some randomness, so sometimes draws can be poor. Sometimes you can't tell what someone has. Theme is thin as paper.

OVERALL: It's a great game in a small package. Combines the stock feel with push-your luck and a bit of auction. Card counting is recommended, but not imperative. So many ways to trick people so you can slyly grab a different category majority. Great with 3 players, since you can try to get the other two players to compete for a category you don't want.

It's common on BGG to say that a game has a 'pasted on' theme. Biblios is a fun, enjoyable game, with the character of Canasta (IMO ... bluffing, deception, guessing, leading to a big reveal), but much shorter and more random.

However, it literally has NOTHING to do with its theme. The mechanics, the win conditions, the style of gameplay, the interactions encouraged ... nothing. The theme is just an art direction. It's well-presented, but about as relevant as putting football players on Skip-Bo and calling it NFL, the Card Game. 

That presentation also serves to double the price.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
You would think that a theme about monks collecting different libraries of books wrapped in a brown box with a bald guy on it would be a good enough reason to make you want to play this game but wait, there's more! This is a really fun two phased set collection auction game where you spend the first phase allocating a series of cards into different regions (your hand, the flop for other players to draft from, and a deck that will be auctioned off in the second phase of the game) and the second phase bidding on the deck of cards created in the first. This leads to some really interesting dynamics reminiscent of games like for sale and modern art that keep me engaged in Biblios and the title in my collection. I still think that the "forbidden lore" library is the porn.

In some ways it's like For Sale, in that at the end you give up cards in a bid for another card. But the theme is just so dry. At least For Sale has the funny homes. This is just... draft then sell then add up points really. At least the point system is simple. But still... it just doesn't do it for me. Maybe a Euro-gamer would like this more as a filler-type game.

This great filler surprised me a lot with the actual depth of gameplay that can offer. It's so simple... and yet there's so much with the bluffing, the foreseeing, the memory and the hand management! I love auction and here this mechanic works great and it's very intense.

The component are also great, the dice are awesome and the art is very nice. Yet what I enjoy the most about this game ist the satisfying feeling that comes, when I can foresee something or deduce what the other players might be doing. Biblios is my favourite filler card game at this point. I'm going to play it a lot!

RATING: 5

Zu zweit sehr schön spielbar mit einem gewissen Unsicherheitsfaktor: Man weiß zwar, dass maximal 11 grüne/gelbe/rote, bzw. 25 braune/blaue Punkte im Spiel sein können; da aber 21 Karten am Anfang vom Spiel entfernt werden (plus 6 Geldkarten), ist nicht klar, wieviele Punkte man für eine Mehrheit braucht, und welche Karten man weggeben kann, um in der Auktionsphase Gold zu ersteigern.
Ausserdem wird durch das Entfernen der Karten die Spielzeit skaliert, was auch sinnvoll ist.

Schlisslich sehen die Karten schön aus, und die kleine Würfelablage zwischen den Spielern passt auch dazu.

Sehr gutes Reisespiel, findet Karin.

I was surprised my kids aged 7 and 9 had no trouble playing along. One of our families top 5 games. Like other great family games, it scales really well, and with adults you can make this a very engaging game.  With kids, there's just enough of a lack of contorl to make the game fun if you play more fast and loose.

RATING: 5.5
It's OK: nothing more. The Church cards really don't make much of a difference to the final score; and really, although mildly entertaining, there just ain't all that much to Biblios. 

The comparisons with PAX (the far superior game) have me baffled. The only thing I see in common between the two is the card-drafting mechanism, which appears to have been lifted from the much, much better Reiner Knizia game, The Merchants of Amsterdam. In fact, Biblios feels very much like a Frankenstein's monster version of many a Knizia title.

Very nice looking, though, with a theme which has been lovingly pasted on.

A nice drafting and auctioning game that plays quickly. The card for me, one for the auction and one for each of my opponents draft is reminiscent of Knizia's Merchants of Amsterdam. There is a fair degree of chaos, but it still gives you a few things to  think about.  

I like the artwork in my Dr Finn's edition, though members of my group complain about the preponderance of blacks, browns and dark blues.  The production quality is good all round.

Fun and clever filler with some interesting decisions.  Not exactly fireworks, but good for what it is.

Okay, the privately draw cards and decide whether to take a card, put the card in the phase 2 auction pile, or put it in the "available to the other players" array, is a fun central mechanic.  

One of my favorite fillers.  Giving it a 7.  April 2012.

This is a game that both gamers and non-gamers enjoy.  It is quick and pleasing for just about everyone.  Raising it to an 8. October 2014.

Putting this game into perspective, in particular, comparing it to all the other short games out there, considering how readily even non-gamers embrace it, Biblios deserves to be bumped up to a 9.  May 2016.

Well designed, I enjoyed the two phases of the game and I think this is something my family would enjoy. It’s a good filler with seemingly interesting choices but ultimately felt too much like guess work for me. I’d need to play it more to get a better feel. The first phase was mainly pushing your luck to acquire the best card while seeding the auction deck and keeping half an eye on what your opponents are collecting. Having only a 1/3 knowledge of the auction deck in my 3 player game felt like too little knowledge to make any solid decisions or plans. For what it is though, a light filler card game it is fun and I wouldn’t turn my nose up at playing.

Tentative rating. Played two three player games last night. Both were very close games, but all involved seemed to have fun. The spin down/up vp mechanic for the categories was interesting. It also felt like a double edged sword - if YOU choose to go for the church card, you tip your hand on what you're strong in/what you're weak in. I suppose you could bluff when playing the church, but it feels (emphasis: feels - with only two plays hard to say for sure) like there are too few church instances of those church cards to want to throw it away on a bluff. Maybe that's the meta though?   Anyhow, I enjoyed it, looking forward to more plays to come.

The theme is non-existent and could be anything; board is completely useless as you're just competing for the highest total of each colour. Despite that, it's a really light and fun bluffing/bidding card game. Can be easily taught to anyone in 1 to 2 minutes.

RATING: 8
We shied away from Steve Finn games simply because they typically involved mechanisms we don't enjoy. This one especially as it has auctioning in it, one of our least favorite mechanisms. But after getting and really enjoying his "Cosmic Run" we decided to give this a try. And after getting it in a trade discovered that it really is a good little filler game. The game plays quick and easy. In the first half of the game players alternate drawing cards, keeping one, discarding another to a common deck then distributing the rest to other player(s). The strategy comes in knowing what to keep, what to discard and what to give your opponents. In the second half of the game you use the cards in your hand to auction for the cards that were discarded to the common pile earlier. So it becomes a very thinky game where you try and decide do you keep the gold to get better cards later or hold on to other cards to increase your chances of winning one of the dice that count towards your point total at the end of the game.

Really good and interesting card game.
2 main phase during the game. At first a drafing phase and later the bidding phase. Both phases are interesting and you can learn someting about the bluffing strategy of your partners.
The compoents are very nice. Especially the book-box looks great.
I gave it also as a birthday present.

Die 2 Phasen des Spiels (erst Card-Drafting und dann Versteigerung) erscheinen spielerisch einfach aber ergeben eine Menge Potential für ein spannendes Spiel. Es ist schwierig abzuschätzen wie man selber steht bis es zur Endabrechnung kommen. Das Ergebnis kann schon sehr knapp und überraschend sein.

Great game, small package. One of those "how could something this simple be this good" games.
The mechanic of drawing cards 1 at a time equal to the player number +1 and deciding whether you keep it (1 card) put it in the auction pile (1 card) or give it to the other players (the rest) is clever and means that the game plays very quickly.

Good filler that is engaging throughout and actually has some tough decisions. I like that you can bluff in the auctions and bluff in how you manipulate the point categories.

I think the game lacks a certain elegance because there's a lot going on - card drafting, set collection, auctioning, market manipulation, memory - and I kind of wonder what the game is trying to be. Doesn't help that the game is quite abstract.

Neato.  I haven't played For Sale in ages, but this reminded me of it a lot.  I think it's a great middleweight, gamer-minded way to burn a half hour.  I was around to experience the original smell of this, and it was so powerful that I actually declined to play the game.  It took a long time, but the owner's copy did eventually settle :-)  Game-wise, no real complaints about any of it.  I think it works.

Very fun, fast filler-type game.  I wish there were more dice-manipulation cards.  In the future, we're going to try rolling the dice for the set up (instead of all 3's) and making sure all of the dice manipulation cards are in the deck and not discarded in set up.

An engaging game that utilizes card-drafting and hand-management in order to win auctions at the end. Sounds a bit complicated but the game is quite simple and quick to play. The game does reward a good memory but includes elements that reduce the importance of a good memory; personally, I see memory as a fun/skilful mechanic and don't particularly like the design choice to minimize its importance. That being said, many gamers dislike memory and the end result is still an enjoyable filler.

RATING: 8
I'm enjoying it thus far. The components are good, with a nice game board and colourful dice. It's quite striking when set out on the table. The cards are pretty and are quite thick and study, but thus are hard to shuffle (forget riffle shuffling). The colour scheme is a bit odd, but the symbols does allow a nice workaround for colourblind people.

This game does combine nicely a short playtime, with a good amount of strategy. I could see people getting annoyed about the draw one card, push-your-luck mechanic of the gift phase. I'm not sure if I'm not annoyed about it; thus far, I'm not, but I'm going to need a few more plays to cement how I feel.

Great filler game.  A drafting and auctioning card game with imperfect information.  It plays great with 2, and I imagine it plays great with 3 and 4 as well.  I think actually place it above Jaipur in my 'need a quick game to fill some time' category. Biblios does reward players who can card count, but there is enough blind information it isn't predetermined who will win.  Also, scores aren't evident until the end, which helps when playing with my wife.

This game is great, we have fun every time we play. We have renamed this game "the hand of regret" because after the initial draft you seem to always regret the decisions you made.

Like playing two filler games, one after the other - first, you play a game of agonising drafting decisions, trying to build up a nice set of cards. The second game is an auction, where you use those cards to build up stronger sets from the cards that were set aside during drafting. There are also cards that let you adjust the worth of certain sets which is where the game's tension really sets in.

Glad I bought this. What a fun game! Plays quickly, but packs a lot in. 'For Sale'-like auctioning, guessing what kind of sets everyone's trying to collect, plus a little bit of press-your-luck during the donation phase. Very nice game.

We did get a couple of 'I like the art in For Sale better' comments (my wife and mom), but I'm fine with the components.

The choices of what to do in the first round (throw in a card to go up for auction later, keep it for yourself, or give it to your opponents) really guide how you bid in the second round.

This is the game I break out to teach new people what a fun modern game can be.

Biblios is the perfect marriage of great mechanics, push-your-luck card drafting, set collection and auctions.  They give the right mix of known and hidden information, enough signals to strategize while leaving room for small surprises and intentional misdirection.  There is still quite a bit of luck of the draw, but a great performance at auction is more than enough to make up for it.

It has engaged nearly everyone who I've played right from the first game.  Almost always ends up playing twice or more.  Plenty of post-game analysis from all players, a sure sign of a fun game.

Plays fast and wonderfully from 2 to 4 players in a small package.  What more could you ask for from a light game?  Superlative.

Very original card game. It's goal is basically to get a point majority in the five card colors. In the first half of the game you draft the cards in a sort of push your luck way. In the second half of the game you bid on the cards. You can pay color cards with money cards, but you can also buy the money by discarding color cards that you don't (think) you need. This makes for pretty interesting decisions. Besides that you can also manipulate the value of the different colors. All in all a quick but challenging card game with a nice balance between luck and strategy.

Looks pretty straightforward. You draw and decide cards to keep, give or auction until the deck is exhausted. Adjust category values whenever Bishops come up. You then auction the cards in the in the shuffled auction pile one by one, spending gold on workers and resources, spending numbers of cards on gold. Again, adjusting category values whenever Bishops come up. After auction, player with highest points in each category takes the die. Tie breaker is letter closest to "A". The die is the number of VPs for winning that category. Add up die value VPs. Highest VPs is winner. Tie breaker for VPs is most gold.

More plays might elevate my rating of this game, because my first play was not under ideal conditions. I liked that the game is easy to teach, quick to learn, and fast to play all at the same time. The challenge of grabbing enough color cards in the early rounds, and enough gold to have strength in the auctions is very interesting. The problem I foresee in this game is the fact that memory may play a stronger role than I'd like. The player who can more accurately track who has taken what colors and how much they are worth is definitely in the power position. I wonder how the game might work if there was more open information. My first thought was to only keep hidden the cards you take for yourself in the early rounds. Don't worry, I'm not changing (ruining) the game with my own variants yet, I need to play more by the written rules, but after my first experience these were my initial thoughts. Definitely a game with strong potential to move up in rating when I've played more.

A solid push-your-luck and bidding game.  Good filler.

Still, I am not entirely sure how I feel about the push-your-luck element.  Furthermore, picking the other two cards (in a 3 player game) that the drawing player put out is almost always a painfully obvious decision.

I'd play it again, but I'm not sure if I'd buy it to play with non-gamers (even though it can be had for fairly cheap, $17.)

A fast, fun, two-stage game. It's totally slap-a-theme, but it works well for what it is. I would play this in a series of rounds rather than one quick game.  If one player gets to manipulate the dice more than the others, it could be a bit unbalanced.  I have only played 2-p and liked it.  May be better or worse with more players.

RATING: 7.75
A really fun filler with meat to it. Simple gameplay that brings a push-your-luck tension to card allocation. And the second half is sizing up your opponents as you bid for cards during the auction and pick which categories you hope you can squeeze out a win. I love pushing my luck, I love bidding in auctions, and I love playing with simple mechanics that support deeper strategy. It's great!

Quickly becoming a second go-to game for a peaceful end of the evening.  Fun, with a pleasant level of strategy and press-your-luck.  Plays quickly.  I like the artwork.  In the 2-player game, you end up holding a few too many cards for comfort.  The 2-player game differs quite a bit from the 3 and 4-player game, but it scales well, even if there's not a lot of control with 4 players.

The cards aren't as thick as I'd like, and they're already somewhat worn after the first dozen plays (with a tough crowd).  The green is so dark it's hard to distinguish from black in dim lighting.  That's not a significant issue, though, because the green and black images are quite distinct.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
Interesting for a filler - very gamey and whilst most gamers will find it simple it is way too complex for the non-gamer. Sort of an area majority game with an auction element to it.

If I have a criticism it is that it is all over too fast. The mechanic seems to demand rounds of play and a steady build up, but hey, I am probably being too picky to expect that, its a solid gamers filler, nothing less, nothing more.

One play.  A nice, quick game.  A bit similar to For Sale in that you spend the first half of the game building up your hand to use in the second half of the game, but there are more (and cleverer) decisions to be made here.  The scores tend so low, though, that the luck of the cards has an overly profound effect on whether you are competitive.  There's also a very strong memory component, I feel, if you want to play well.  But the way the game plays is somewhat compelling, and the choices you make are very interesting.  I'd play again, but probably not buy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Once as you've prepped the deck the game gets going without a hitch.  I think I prefer to play this at 2p as, despite the removal of 21 cards, one is more able to maintain a cursory history of the cards given the opponent and the cards buried in the auction deck.  It challenges your memory, flexibility and ability to manipulate your opponent all in under 20 minutes.  The card quality of the version I have, however, leaves much to be desired as the cards can't help but be marked up with nicks and rips.  I've played it enough that [i]every[/i] card is nicked and ripped so it affords no real temptation to remember which card is ruined which way (I hope).

// This game combines several elements into a streamlined

a little more control over end game scoring and how my
hand of cards is constructed compared to those of my 
opponents; it feels a little random as to whether I'll
be able to win or not, but that opinion may change with

A fun little trick taking game and there is a lot of depth to it at first play. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
2 phase card based game. In the first phase, each player takes it in turn to pick 4 cards, 1 at a time. Of these 4, you can save one card for yourself, put one in a face down auction pile and place 2 face up for your opponents to take. 

You can bid for the auction cards later on, which is the second phase of the game. 

The simple aim is to have the highest numeric value of a particular set of cards. There are 5 sets. There are also cards used as 1-3 gold. 

There are 2 clever mechanics in the game. In the bidding portion, you bid for cards with your gold and for gold cards with numbers of "suit" cards you are prepared to give up. The second clever  bit is the bishop cards which can be used to raise or lower the score awarded to the player with the nighest number on the cards of each set. This starts at 3 and can range from 1 to 6, as scoring is denoted with 5d6. 

This is a pretty clever mechanism for a card game and only takes 20 minutes or so to explain, set up and play to a finish. One of those fun filler type games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In the center are five dice representing different colors. The number value of the die represents the point value of that category at the end of the game. 

This game takes place in two phases. In the first, players take turns drawing cards one at a time and designating where they go: one into their hand, one into the auction pile and others equal to the # of remaining players into the public space for the other players to take. This continues around the players until the draw pile is empty.

In phase two, the top card of the auction pile is revealed and players bid on it with the cards in their hand. In the end, the player with the most value of the particular category get the points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5

RATING: 7
This is a fine, "low investment, good yield" game. It is a rewarding filler in that respect and I think it deserves to be considered alongside Battle Line as one of the better of that category. Seeding the auction deck allows for long term strategy, choosing cards and bidding allows for tactical play. The decisions are interesting without being brain-burning; nor does the game overstay its welcome. The theme is original and the production is well done. Like most filler games, the theme doesn't permeate the game but I can't think of many examples where that is the case. I'm glad I own it and would definitely recommend it as one the better fillers available.

When You know the rules (very easy) the game is super fast :) Many decisions to make, it is not possible to accomplish in 100% (You don't see all the cards that go to auction deck) but You have to track what is going on all the time as much as possible ;) Great, small game!

Anxious to try it in w/four players.

RATING: 4
Collect sets - in 2 phases, first you draft and build the auction deck, then auction off the cards put in the auction deck in phase 2.

As an abstract this is ok - but the theme and colours actually get in the way for me - I struggled a bit in low light identifying which were which in some suits :(

Theme is so paper thin (is that ironic?), and my overall feeling was the experience was pretty dull - I certainly didn't feel engaged enough to care about the outcome, not a good sign.

Quite like the draft the deck mechanic, but the lack of information you have means it isn't actually that useful, and the luck of the draw means sometimes you can't bury cards you don't want others to have. Knowing what is in the auction pile helps, but of course you won't know most of it - and that lack of info means it's impossible to know when you need to bid high for a card ... 

For me that overwhelms any careful play you can make - and the sleeping cards guarantee you can't card count/deduce what others have. So first part of the game (draft) is ok, second part (auction) I didn't like at all.

Overall - a game I'd play if nothing else was on offer, certainly not interested in owing it and many other games I'd rather play. For a drafting filler Fairy Tale beats this hands down and it's only the drafting bit that interests me!

RATING: 8
This game is just a joy to play.  It's one of those rare games that you can teach in a minute or two yet it is full of tough choices that keep you coming back for more.  The first phase, the gift phase, can often have a bit of a push your luck element.  Do you keep a decent card or send it to the gift pile or auction pile in hopes of drawing something even better?  And the agony when you are faced with having to gift a card on your final draw and it ends up being a great card (why do I never draw single gold coin cards in this situation?!!)

The second phase, the auction phase, is equally as enjoyable.  Even with two players, which is how I always play, the auction phase holds interest.  This usually isn't true for two players, but in this game it just works.

I also love how you eliminate 21 cards from the deck at the beginning of a 2p game.  This gives the whole game an air of uncertainty right up to the end as you don't know what is and isn't in play.

Almost all games are agonizingly close and this, coupled with the short play time, ensure the game gets played over and over.  Me and my wife have no problem playing a full night of this game.  It's just that fun.  Go ahead...do it..add it to your cart and checkout.  You won't be disappointed (just be prepared to air it out for a day or two..everything you hear about the funky smell is true).

Edited 11-17-2011:  Has lost some of its luster after many plays.  Still a solid game that I enjoy very much.  Dropped to an 8.

It doesn't seem like there's much to this at first.  You're basically distributing the deck of cards and trying to get the most of certain suits.  The second half of the game is an auction phase which works really nicely and feels a little like For Sale although in this case the bidding does go around like a normal auction.  Kind of a hard game to describe the feel of.  The dice which indicate the values of winning the suits seem really important after about 5 plays and the game is starting to flow where I can see some strategy and try to manipulate things.  Really neat light game with some deceptive depth.  And I'm liking it more the more I play.

Juego de cartas curioso. En una primera fase del juego, cada jugador se queda con una carta para sí, otra para la segunda fase, y otras tres, que van escogiendo por turno el resto.
Cuando se acaba el mazo, comienza la segunda fase, en la que se van descubriendo las cartas que fueron apartadas. Si es un libro, se puja por ello en dinero. Si es dinero, se puja con cartas.

Además, hay cartas que permiten variar el valor de los dados, que a su vez, son los que dan valor a cada color de cartas. Sencillo, elegante, rápido.. sin grandes pretensiones.

Fast pace, with decent decisions to make with each card play. With five categories to develop, there is a decent amount of decisions in both the gift and auction phases.

The atmosphere created by the push-your-luck draft is a lot of fun - you'll always feel like you've "played it safe" or been too greedy when you're inevitably forced to give your opponents valuable cards, but the game doesn't just create an incredibly enjoyable social dynamic, it's also a mechanically sound feat of game design. The draft is agonising but runs very smoothly, as does the bidding phase. The game also scales superbly and is equally enjoyable at all player counts.

The game itself is a very good filler based on a interesting mechanic. I like the two distinct phases of a game and the two different rules for bidding in the auction phase, everything forces the player to take tough decisions. Bad luck with the draw of the Church cards may ruin your game with few possibilities of reply, yet this is hardly an issue in a 20-30 minutes game. Very good packaging and artwork, excellent game manual. Too bad the card quality is very low and the cards won't fit anymore in the box if you sleeve them. :( I hope they will use better card quality for Uchronia.

One of those games that seems just right from the off; the balance between choice and randomness is neat, the push your luck aspect of choosing cards works well, the game plays smoothly and quickly and all in a nice package too.  A very nice wee game.  Recommended.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ A great filler that is played in two phases: First a draw and split cards among yourself, the pool and the auction (where you have an incomplete knowledge of the cards since you do this, one card at a time) and then, for the second half of the game, the auction/bidding phase, you try to buy the cards to get the majorities you are aiming for.
++ Small table footprint and portable game that can be played really almost anywhere.
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion (though the box is a bit too big for nothing)
++ Super easy to teach, super fast to set-up and fast to play.
 

:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- The small memory aspect of the game, sometimes annoys my wife, as she see that I have an advantage over her.
-- The box is a bit too big for nothing (though the book look of it is great!)
-- I'm not a theme fanatic, but the theme is just pasted on, as it could have been anything and it would work (it is more an abstract, so instead of calling thing the right name, according to the theme, say like "Pigments" card, we just say things like "Value 3 blue" card).
-- At the 2-player count, the game is more predicable, and offer less replayability (better at 3+ player count).
-- Lightweight.

RATING: 5
Updated 8/17/10.

After hearing rave reviews about Scripts & Scribes from Geekbuddies who had managed to snag a first edition from Dr. Finn, I had an Artscow version prepared.  The quality of the Artscow cards probably detracts a little from my enjoyment, and I would love to get my hands on an copy of the original.   

Basically, Scripts & Scribes combines a semi-blind card draft, an auction, and a very feeble stock manipulation mechanic to produce one of the better set majority/plurality games I've encountered. Mechanically, it's an interesting game, but I struggle to connect with it because it lacks any sort of thematic explanation for the action.  We're auctioning off items to try to collect the most of a few types of items (ideally, the ones that end up being the most valuable).  But there's no story arc, no cohesion.  We could easily have played a similar game with a Sticheln deck.  And that is precisely where my disappointment lies.  It's a game that's hard to invest in emotionally, and as a result the outcome often feels meaningless.

Really nice filler and mixes set collection, an auction, and even a little push your luck in about 30 minutes. Components and artwork are nice but the book-shaped box is very thematic and even had a magnetic strip to keep it shut! Plays better at 3-4 players than at 2 in my opinion but I would definitely recommend this light and quick game to everyone.

Major advantages: simple rules, good quality, does not require a lot of space. It is great on a trip. Can be easily played on the train or airplane. It has some randomness, subject does not matter, but instead has: betting, bluffing, elements of the strategy, interaction, counting. And it's all encapsulated in 20-30 minutes of playing! Beginners catch rules quickly. Nice and solid edition. Top game in two, because less chaotic. For me, as a filler it is a really good one.

A really well thought out game. Collect a bundle of cards hoping to get majorities in the five categories who all start with the same points worth but can be changed through the game. But you also have an auction after the card drafting to gain more cards that you buy with the gold cards that you collected in the drafting phase. Get the most points to win. Simple!! 1 Play.

Bought this game because it was listed by Zee on the Dice Tower's top 10 "essential" games.

At the time, it was between print runs, so I ended up purchasing it online, and got it shipped from Europe. :(

It's a good auction game. It has interesting decisions: "Do I want this card? Or do I let everyone bid for it and thake another card later?"

Not sure if the meatiness of this game or the simplicity of For Sale is better.

RATING: 6.75
So clever in the way that the 2 phases interact with each other. The gift phase is facepalm inducing, and the auction phase gives so many extremely tense choices. It's a game that is secretly about insider trading, whilst putting on the most innocent and unique of themes. Highly recommended. One of the best fillers I've ever played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is harmless. Short games, for me, need something cool about them, something to say to me, oh I gotta play this again. That could be a nifty dynamic, a really cool mechanic, but it has to be something. This game just has, what it has.

It isn't a bad game, I just can't think of a compelling reason to play it again.

It's been awhile since I've found a filler this good. This is straight-up addictive. The hidden information makes for some lovely tension, and careful attention to other players' moves is a must. Anytime we bust this out we tend to play 2-3 games in a row!

Fun two-phase set collecting game, with card drafting first phase and auction second phase.  The cards that you draft are currency for the auction phase.  The hook is that cards may be useful both as currency and as final collectables.

Nicely produced for an independent publication but, the card art was muddy and difficult to see when not perfectly lit.

This is one of the better fillers out there! It is a bit longer than other fillers like For Sale and such, but it's not by much, and it's vastly superior than almost every other short games! The push your luck-element when you split the cards, the auction mechanics and the dice modifier cards all add up to a great game which is almost as great with 2, 3 and 4 players.

My recommended number of players: 2, 3, 4
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple and original card game with lots of tough choices. It's useful to know the composition of the deck and that 13 points and 6 points will get you majorities in each of the first and second groups of cards respectively. Uninspiring theme which doesn't relate to the mechanics but the game is quite decent despite that. About 20-25 minutes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Played with 2 and 4 players.  This game takes the cool mechanic from Merchants of Amsterdam -- drafting the cards and assigning them before seeing the entire set of cards - and creates a quick-playing light strategy game around it.  Merchants of Amsterdam went over very poorly with my group, but Scriptorium works well.  Not sure how many players I prefer to play with; in both combinations I've tried, it's gone over well, as players try to estimate just how much it will take to win majorities.  I really enjoy the dilemma of sacrificing a card in a category you think you're winning to get gold - have you scared people away from collecting, say, scribes, so that you only need to keep one or two?

Bumping my rating after more plays because this game is just so easy to get out and play, and it nicely fits into gaming groups.

RATING: 7
Biblios is a very clever card game and much more enjoyable than a first read of the rules led me to believe. It is a card game consisting of five different suits, money cards, and some "point tweaker" cards.

The game is in two halves, somewhat like For Sale. The first half players take turns dishing out cards (one for me, one for you, one for the auction pile...) and there's a pleasant angst in where you have to decide how much you value the card in front of you over what else might crop up.

The 2nd half players auction off the cards that were dished out to the auction pile, bidding money for suit cards and bidding suit cards for money.

It's a slick game that plays fast with plenty of player interaction. I dig it and wouldn't mind owning a copy at some point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A delightful filler that lived up to expectations. Tense decisions in the first round of where to place cards (hand, auction, public offer) since you can only look at 1 card at a time, but also keeps everyone involved since they will get a card too. Then the auctions start where everyone bids on the cards from the auction pile using either gold or cards from their hand. While this is going on players can also influence the value of each set at the end of the game based on certain clergy cards. A quick 30 minute game that offers some good decisions. Since you also discard some cards randomly at the start of each game you're never sure what cards may be out of the game. I only wish the theme was a bit better for non-gamers to be interested in.

Main Positives: Very engaging. Had some weird feeling that it was actually a good thing that we're not rolling the dice provided by the game. 

Fun Factor: Medium to High
Complexity: A bit hard to explain the role of some cards but overall, it's not a difficult game to learn.
Replayability: Yes. I like this very light game.

Main Frustrations and Caveats:
Nothing much. The game's pacing is just right and I don't feel like losing a game is like losing what I have worked so hard for. Very light game indeed!

I'll admit to being totally lost for the first third of the game, just drafting cards randomly.

The game I wanted FOR SALE to be.  The auction mechanic works surprisingly well at 2 players.  With more players, the manipulation of the dice and the ability to corner a strong color seems to be key.  I am still trying to balance the gold in hand with the point cards I need to carry the day in the end game scoring.  Neat way to handle hand management through the two phases on the game.

My kids and I have played this several times and even during the first "explaining everything" round, they got it.  They are gold hoarders and figured that the more gold the better, but quickly discovered after the auction phase was coming closer to an end that keeping some of their less needed "color" cards might have scored them more points than making sure they bid 5 color cards on a 3+ gold card.  Even keeping just 1 "color" card, when all other kids were playing "give me all the golds" would have been enough to win an extra 3 points.

The game is easy to learn, teach, and set up.

RATING: 8
My group was split on this one. Half of us found it boring. The other half (of which I was part) really enjoyed the bidding system and the "Take That" method of feeding crummy cards to your opponents. If you don't like "Take That" games, you won't like "Biblios." Otherwise, it's a great little filler game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
A basic area influence game of sorts with an auction phase at the end and some hidden information. The turn structure is as follows: draw cards from the deck which has 5 influence sets, a money set, and a mess with the value of the area majority fights set. Keep 1 card, leave X out where X is the number of other players so they can each draft 1, and toss a single card into the future auction pile. Build up a hand. Once the deck is exhausted, auction the cards that are in that deck using the money set cards to build up bigger hand majorities and/or to mess with the value of the influence fights again. VPs based on who wins the aforementioned influence fights wins.

This isn't a bad game in the abstract, but I honestly can't imagine getting excited about such a run of the mill overall package. Reminds me of King of Siam in that way, I guess if I was dying for a filler that has these sorts of elements I would find it decently engaging, but I'm not and so I don't. Knowing what is in the auction pile can be very important, and is more than touch unpredictable as well, as there are enough cards in that to swing majorities in a major way at the end of the game, but knowing when you should spend deep or when you should sit pat is a partial crapshoot. Not impressed.

RATING: 8
Cheap game, quick to learn, small easy to take with you to game nights. This is a filler game with a bit more strategy and time needed to play. It's a press your luck style game with multiple phases that keep it interesting. It can stand on it's own, just barely, but usually played as a filler. We always have a good time playing and teaching this game to others. Plays well with 2 players, but more fun with more. This game is out of print, so grab it if you see it.

RATING: 8.5
Simple game that scales well from 2-4. Each player tries to get the highest value in five categories. Inevitably, a player cannot get the highest in every category and must focus on what they can. The first half of the game is the "gift" (or allocation) phase where one gets cards "for free" and the second half is where players auction off the remaining cards. It works very well and plays quickly.

I think I like this one so much because I usually win with the groups I've played against. I even try and share my basic strategies that often prove successful. There are a lot of games that I just don't do well at, this isn't one of them. Really fun, clever, and plays pretty fast. I love getting a card every turn and having to make tough decisions about where I distribute my cards without having all of the information at once. That is a cool and clever mechanic.

Great short game with 3 that still works surprisingly well with 2. I expect 4 will be even better as the tension of the unknown increases and the difficulty of deciding how much to specialise in particular colours especially when they become devalued adding to that tension.

My favorite 3 player card game.  Some great looking dice that are only used to show their current values.  Quick, fun play with interesting decisions.  "What to keep and what to put in the auction pile for later?  Did I control what cards I gave away that turn??  First part is a card draft and the second part an auction for the first round's auction pile.

I love that there are 2 parts to this game.  A delicious two course meal.  The auction is just fantastic.  Plays quickly, but it's not a filler by any means.  I've seen this referred to as "For Sale on steroids"... WRONG!  It's far superior.

The game is so good, I will even forgive the noxious chemical stink bomb when opening the game. And the graphica blunder of not putting the numbers and symbols on the same side of the card. How that got by playtesting is beyond me. But for those of us with no color problems, it doesn't matter.

Biblios made it to my Spiel 2010 list, but unfortunately due to printing problems the game couldn’t make it in time for the fair. Fast forward a few months and I was able to play the game at a fair. It turned out to be a quick cardgame where the players first divide up a large deck of cards by allocating, one at a time, one card to themselves, one to an auction deck, and one card to every other player. A player draws all these cards in succession, but must decide upon the allocation immediately after seeing the card. After every card is allocated the remainder is auctioned with the purpose of building up several majorities of various resources, while at the same time sparingly altering their value. That value determines the VPs, and most VPs win.

The game plays pleasantly quickly enough, and the material in the Iello edition is gorgeous. But the game was a bit... I dunno. Out of control, perhaps? There is a good deal of guessing what to do with cards, and then there is the fact that with low player numbers, a significant amount is withdrawn from the deck at random. It creates a bit of turn angst, without doubt, but it’s not turn angst of a kind I find enjoyable. I’m not a card games player, but if I compare to Jaipur, then [i]that[/i] game allows for much more direct control over what you do and don’t. As a result, although Biblios is not really a bad game, I just couldn’t bring myself to play a second game.

Played this on the same day as Slush Fund.  So Slush Fund seemed worse than it probably was, or this seemed worse than it is.  I am not quite sure.  Not that this is a bad game.  A nice mechanic for setting hands and a fun auction.  And that I won 10-3-2-2 didn't hurt either ;)

Just like Slush Fund the quality is great as far as I could tell.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Setting aside the thin veneer of a theme, this is a game about collecting the best cards you can in various categories, and at times trying to manipulate their relative value for scoring points at the end.  What makes the game unique is the two phases.  

First you select cards and assign them to yourself, the "grab bag" for other players, or to an auction pile.  The auction pile is then sold off one by one, and players are using previously collected cards to bid on them.  The challenge is to manage your inventory to get better cards, not knowing what's coming up next.

Simple, light - works fine with 2 players.  But I'm really curious to try this with more.

Great card filler game which is easy to grasp and has a good amount of strategy/luck for both players and non-players. 
There are two different parts in this game. First part is drafting, second auctioning the leftover cards. Both parts are interesting and fun. You will almost never know how much points you really need for each color so you don't know who will really win in most games.
Sadly my only experience with this game is two player game, but I believe this could change soon - and if it would be good, I can see the increase a rating for a bit.

What I like:
- simple rules, you can teach the game in a minute before first play
- for this is just a card game, there are a lot of mechanisms included (set collection, hand management, auction/bidding, card drafting). Each are nice implemented and easy remembered.
- game flow is superfast. The game time (two player games) is between 10-15 minutes. Setup and tear down is also super quick.
- great game box looking as a book

What I dislike:
(there is nothing I dislike about this game, but I will try to sum of potential negative things)
- the luck in card draw could be too high for somebody (I don't care personally but I can see it could be an issue)
- the art on the cards is too repetitive and I would say mediocre
- this is very light filler game good for game openings, don't expect anything else

RATING: 5
Components: Nice chunky dice; but what's the point of dice if we never get to roll them? Good artwork on the cards. The cards could be of better quality.

Experience: Not sure this really works as a two player game, as each player can only see 50% of the cards that the opponent drafts, so there is little indication of which colors are in contention.

As with any auction game, we didn't have a good handle on the value of gold in the first game (we conserved our money, and suddenly had a ton left over).

The theme is odd, but this is actually a stockmarket game where you try to gather the more shares in 5 family and try to ensure that those family will score a much VP as possible.

+ For a self edited game, the rules are surprisingly clear and the components are of good qualities.
+ Many choices and decision taking in a short playing time 20-30 min.

- Some players doesn't like the winner take it all effect. Personaly I think it's appropriate for this kind of game and keeps tension until the end of the game, moreover the game doesn't pretend to be a strategy game where you control everything. Anyway like in most card games there's some luck so you can play several games and add the scores to mitigate this.
- The artwork could be better.

A good surprise, a very fine and subttle card game wich definitly deserve a larger audience.

Here's another game that bored me. There's different phases to this game. And the first one is different but tedious. And the other seems rather straight-forward back-and-forth tug-of-war with minor opportunities for misdirection or strategy.

In the end, I just didn't see the point. Maybe it was supposed to feel as dull and austere as monastic work. And there seem to be a sufficient choice of better drafting, set-collection, and auction games available with similar length.

Similar feel to For Sale in the two step play, but to me this is much more interesting. For Sale is just buy low sell high reduced to its simplest form, but Biblios adds a bit of push your luck, card counting, and screw your neighbor. A decent amount of luck is involved, but that's ok in a twenty minute filler that still has some interesting decisions to make.

nice. easy to learn and play. some interesting decisions thanks to the "drafting"-like mechanims of drawing cards equal to the numbe rof players+1 and distributing them amongst the players, with 1 card going to what will be the auction pile in the second half of the game.

Interesting mix of set collection, push your luck, memory and some other elements...

I liked the game but with only 5 scoring opportunities a lot of it comes down to luck of the initial drawing.

After a couple of plays I can see this as being a game I will get bored of fast. Not because of it's simplicity. Some games are simple and fast, yet fun.

This just doesn't have the enjoyment factor that some other quick filler games have and when it doesn't have that it needs to rest on something else smart... but there really isn't that much else to the game.

Others find this concept more original than I do. You select about half your hand by choosing from among the cards you draw. Then, you acquire the balance of your hand by bidding on all the cards, one at a time, that no players selected in the first phase. You use some of the cards you selected in the first phase to make bids in the second phase, discarding those cards if you win the bid. You try to find the right balance in your hand between cards used for bidding and cards that will help you gain majorities. 
Other games have used a similar 'choose your card' method to select hands, and, of course, auctioning cards is common; putting the two together in this way is a neat trick, but I'm not sure the game justifies the hype.

[September 2017 - 7.7]
A lot of people compare Biblios to For Sale (my favorite filler game), so I definitely wanted to check it out. While I enjoy Biblios, I still think For Sale, and even No Thanks, are better. The latter two create a little more emotion in the bidding, whilst there is more hidden information in Biblios that you're not really sure where others stand and what cards will come up in the auction. I really like the die (point) manipulation aspect of the game (kinda like a stock market), but sometimes I feel as if there are not enough of those cards that show up, and you're left with mostly 3-point dice, just as you started the game.

These are picky complaints, though and the game is still a lot of fun, fast and easy to explain.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Similar to For Sale in that it has two distinct phases. Playing with three or four adds a fun drafting mechanic. The dice scoring mechanic is novel, but can cause the final score to not be very indicative of how close the game was. Luck can play a big part especially with two players, but this is a solid, fun game.

RATING: 8
Fun auction game that plays well at all counts.  Easy to teach and short.  The two phase game structure is reminiscent of For Sale with significantly more depth.  I usually approach this as a light game but if you pay attention to card distribution and count cards you can make the game more competitive.

I just don't get why so many people like this game.  I wanted to enjoy it, but after 5 plays, I just don't see it.

Pasted-on theme with complete RANDOMNESS in the decision-making process.
I suppose you could card-count to get an edge, but suits have different numbers of cards and values, making it tough to wrap your head around.  It never feels like the decisions I make is of any real meaning as it can easily change throughout the course of the game.

Definitely a "gamer's game" and likely needs to be played with the same crowd consistently to really get anything out of it.

I find Scripts & Scribes to be an adequate, but forgettable For Sale variant. While I am sure skill has an impact, and will continue to do so for future plays, it seemed that just random card draw is even more important, and while I understand some people like that sort of thing it did not really work for me. On top of that I did not like the chunkiness of the victory points. There are only discrete chunks of victory points, and it seemed like that was not quite enough for this game.

Players are monks, acquiring books.  Solid two player super filler, split into two phases.  The first phase, the players take turns to draft four cards, one at a time, into their hand, and auction pile, and to the gift pile.  The other players then each take one of the gift cards.  This is repeated until the deck is empty.  Then the auction pile is auctioned off, one card at a time, and a winner is determined.  Cards drafted during the first phase of the game are used to bid in the second phase of the game - very much in the style of For Sale.  The object of the game is to hold card majorities in five suits, to get the scoring die in that suit (which can be valued between 1 and 6, depending on game events).  Highest die total acquired wins.  Feels like I've played it before in other guises (For Sale, several Knizia's), but rock solid and fun.

RATING: 8
The rules are much simpler than it seems when you read them, but the gameplay is deeper and more subtle than it seems when you first play it.  It has the simplicity of a game like Lost Cities, but the card evaluations and decision making are more interesting.  I've tried it with 2 and 3 players so far, it's addictive and I've been enjoying it a lot lately.

Update: With 4 players the game becomes a bit more random, it's hard to tell whether you are winning a category or not.  This isn't a bad thing, just a noticeable difference from the 2 player game.

One of my favorite games. The deck building component is intriguing in that you are making decisions for you immediately, your opponents, and you later in the game. The changing scoring system keeps the game interesting and gives you a chance to win throughout the game. Plus, the game has an auction component to make it more exciting. Great game.

RATING: 5
There are 6 asymmetrical suits in the deck, mixed in with 1,2, and 3 coin cards.   The entire deck is distributed amongst the players via card draw, mini-draft and auction.   After all is said and done, whoever has the highest value in each suit wins points (1-6, nominally 3).  It's a pretty anti-climactic finish, and most of the game is spent splitting up the deck.  It's repetitive and dull, even for a filler.

An easy pick, when I'm looking for a lighter game that won't be over too quickly. Despite it's lighter elements, still an intriguing experience. 

The first phase is a mechanic I haven't seen anywhere else: you must give a card to both partners, yourself and the future auction pile, but you only draw one at a time. You think "This is a great card, but could I draw something better for myself?" or "It's only a little money, but the next card has to go to me - what's if it's worse?" The second phase may just be pretty straight-forward auctioning, but the genius is in the lead-up to it through phase one.

Biblios has recently been republished. I missed it first time around and am very glad to have found it now. It is a card game with two phases. You spend the first part of the game distributing the cards to each player and to an auction stack. Then the second part of the game is spent auctioning off the auction stack. Cards are either Gold (which you pay for in other cards) or one of the five sets (which you pay for in gold). 

Throw in a clever points mechanism which determines the value of each set to the person with the majority at the end of the game, and you have an excellent 45 minute game.

While not a bad game at all (hey, I won on my first try), it's a little bit lighter than I thought it would be.  Perhaps some variants would make it more interesting, but this isn't a game I would reach for when choosing what to put on the table.

If taken as a short time killer (it's not really a filler), Biblios serves its purpose marvelously.  Perhaps the game plays better with more people, but with only 3 at my table, it just kind of came and went while we were looking to set up a follow-up game.

But yes, the box is pretty cool.  Reminds me of those old agendas they used to sell in the 80s.  Dinky Diary I think they were called?  Yes.  That was a tangent.

Pleasantly surprised with this little game.  You can teach it & begin playing in just a few minutes (think Splendor), and games take about a half hour.  Games are surprisingly fun, with a nice balance of skill and luck.  The box itself is small and light, too, and is easy to throw in a purse or bag.

An excellent card game that has players distributing cards among everyone well before the value of those cards is permanently established. Scales really well between these numbers and is a blast to replay a few times in a row. Each game feels different due to random cards being removed each time, it's really interesting to bluff your way to victory in a category by one point, or improving a colour you have only a few of, to redirect player's attention from a colour you want to collect for cheap.

15-30m, 2-5 players. 25+ plays.

2017-02-18 : First play and it's immediately obvious why it has such a high rating : it's easy to teach and deceptively easy to play - until you discover the tricky stuff and the nuances of the game. I came in dead last in my first play and still loved how the game worked.
2017-02-28 : Second play, now with 2-players, and the game played ultra-quickly but still gave a good think and tension, so it's the ideal 15-minute filler.
2017-04-23 : Another number of plays with 3 and 4 players solidifies my impression of it - plays well with all player counts and it's very much more a game of skill then luck in that observing what other players collect and be smart about it will win you the game

This is a decent little card game.  At first I had my doubts when I heard it was in a VCR case but I will admit that it's a fun set collection/push your luck card game.  This game only has two phases which makes it easy to learn.  The first is a kind of like a blind drafting mechanism and the second is an auction phase.  I enjoy the 1st editions artwork but probably not as much as the second edition.  It plays fast and I think scales well regardless of the number of players.  I think I would rather spend a bit more time and play Ra.

RATING: 4
Visually beautiful game, but lacking in interesting strategy decisions.  Theme pasted-on and does not engage the player.  Play consists of a "gift phase" in which players must decide whether to keep, auction or give away cards.  This phase is mildly interesting as decisions must be made as cards are drawn one by one.  Then play shifts into the "Auction phase," in which cards are auctioned.  Memory of what one has put in the pile becomes important here.  In all, game play strikes me as bland and flavorless; when I asked my wife if she wanted to play again, she immediately named a half dozen games she would prefer, and I agreed with her.

Minor annoyances: cards are extremely stiff and difficult to shuffle, and the storage well for them is badly designed -- it allows you to remove about 2/3 of the cards with ease, but you can't get the others without inverting the box.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Great filler. The Gift phase is a bit slow, and lacks social interaction, but the hints of push your luck and card drafting keep it interesting and engaging, even for the inactive players. The Auction phase is utterly brilliant and provides most of the game's intrigue. The game plays very quietly though, and I wish it was a bit more engaging, but the simple rules make it very accessible. I have yet to introduce the game, without players wanting a second try, and given its short playtime, its easy to oblige.

This game is great and has a lot of my gaming prereqs: short time, auction elements, card-based, randomization through card removal, and a simple ruleset. A surprising amount of game and tension is built into a 25 minute experience. 

One minor flaw I've seen in the game is that the 3rd and 4th players are at fairly large disadvantages. I'd say that the 2nd player is probably the strongest at the start of the game. He/she has first choice of the first draft, and immediately after has an opportunity to pick from the deck. Maybe give 1 gold to player 3 and 2 gold to player 4? After a couple more plays: yep, the 4th player is definitely, definitely at a disadvantage. By the time it's your turn, a lot of secret information and choice cards have been obtained by your opponents. The hole you start in is significant.

At 50 plays I am convinced that the 4th player disadvantage is factual.

Features a draft phase and an auction phase, as players try to build up their hand to get point-scoring majorities in the five different categories (suits), which will earn victory points (represented by dice, the value of which can also be manipulated).  The heart of the game revolves around the hidden information of what categories other players are going for, and the surprise at the end when cards are revealed is tense and exciting.  Equally good with 2, 3 or 4.  Also features one of the best box covers ever! (designed to look like a book)  Outstanding game in its class!  Only negative is the cardstock quality - the cards don't shuffle well and damage easily.  Magnificent artwork though!

I've played with 2p twice as often as 3-4p combined.  The negative space is so interesting in a 2p game since you'll end up seeing 75% of the deck before the auction begins, but the other 25% is obviously crucial.  Interesting bluffing/misdirection possibilities for that reason, which I think elevates this above other similar set collection games.

S&S is one of my favorite games. I rate it a 10, as relative to its genre, I'd rather play this. Yes, it's light but the strategy is surprisingly deep.  It's a game similar to For Sale in that there are two phases. You collect cards in each phase but the first acquisition phase merely sets you up for the auction where most of the fun happens. 

In the auction, you pay for suit cards with gold but pay for gold cards with (any) cards played face down so people don't know what you're discarding. You can openly collect a majority of cards in a suit but then shave them down secretly knowing that everyone else has abandoned that category as "lost" to you.  I've shaved cards down in the auction phase from 6 points to 1 (and won) because everyone knew I had a lot of cards and stopped competing with me. [i]I thought you had a lot of that?! Well, I DID...[/i] You need to bid gold cards for gold cards just to keep others from getting cheap gold and to make them think you have more gold than you really do.

There's a lot of psychological play in convincing others to back off because you have something wrapped up and to being sneaky about pursuing a category. Trying to predict who is collecting which suits is not always obvious and you have to mess with other players in the auction to the point of sometimes getting stuck with stuff that you were just trying to bid up.

played a few rounds of this and i have a fine time, its very light for my tastes, but i like the card counting and push your luck elements. the auction round is fun as well.

i did find it a bit obvious what to go for and what to poison, but that didn't make it any less pleasant.

i think this makes for a good, but not excellent filler.

Biblios has such a simple mechanic but man it can leave with you a lot of tough decisions; is this the best card I will draw?  Do I take it?  Do I put it in the auction pile?  Do I put it in the public space?  Effectively you know ALMOST every pertinent detail in the game, minus the removed cards, but the draw will curve your optimal strategy but even if that doesn't pan out, you can manipulate the end scoring.  So simple but so clever!

I am not usually one for auction games but this has almost more of a betting feel to it, but you better not get caught without the gold to back up your lies!

Biblios hits a similar spot as Sea of Clouds with a greater degree of control; while it may not be as exciting it is definitely more strategic with less take that.

With all that said this is quite a relaxing game to play, it's not a brain-burner, there's very little conflict but it will definitely not lull you into complacency or boredom.

See comments below, but didn't love this one so it went bye bye.

[b]previous comment:[/b]

Violating my typical "play ten times before rating" rule because I donated this one and will likely not play it many more times if any.  I found Biblios to be a resounding "meh."  It's not a bad game by any means, but I didn't really find the decisions very interesting or taxing.  The novel manipulation of the scoring categories was pretty clever, and I'd love to see that applied to a game with more meat to it, but the draft-then-auction as the entire game without much else happening was just not very engaging.

(2-4 players) I like it. Some interesting choices to be made and I can see how more of the game will reveal itself with time. It is a bit like Lost Cities in that you have to gamble among the various suits and divulge information about your hand to your opponent.

06/09/2012 - An interesting, two stage card game. First you draft cards - keeping some and putting others in an auction pile, then you use the cards you kept to bid on the remainder. 

Not very deep, but a great filler that would get play by non-gamers. I rated it 7.5 rather than my normal 'filler rating' of 7 and was tempted to give it an 8.

Summary: Clever numbered card game with auction and stock-market like elements.

Rating history:
1st play: :star::star::star::nostar::nostar:

4p - Fairly busy and all-or-nothing with 4p. Probably better with less.

1st play: I almost ordered this a few times back before Iello published it. Each time I held off because it seemed to be a type of game I'm not that interested in: numbered card games. I finally got to play it and it was both better and worse than I expected: worse because them game is even more numbery than I expected; better because I actually didn't mind the numery-ness as much as I usually do. Still, I wouldn't expect this to be a game I come back to more than a couple more times. I prefer my 2p card games more complex.

My friend Joel Lytle in New York called my attention to Scripts & Scribes, a couple of years ago, and I have been trying to purchase this card game ever since.  I learned Steve Finn was republishing it under the title Biblios, and immediately placed a pre-order last fall, which arrived this afternoon.  

Gaming friends came over and with a few minutes read on the rules we were playing.  There are two phases.  Cards are "gifted" then an auction phase follows and a portion  of the "gifted" cards are auctioned.  There are five categories and the highest card score in each gains the victory points for that category registered on a die that players can adjust throughout the game with Church cards.  Interesting, in the auction, Gold Cards are used to purchase category cards, whereas unknown, face down cards are used to purchase Gold Cards.  I lot of juggling goes on.

The description here does not do the game justice.  You best try to calculate who is saving and doing what.  Strategy is convoluted.  The is a lot of uncertainty in the game, and when you think you are setting yourself up for a high score, you may indeed be setting up your opponent. Technically, the maximum number of victory points in the game is 19, but with 3 players, 7 victory points won the game each time.  

I don't think the box has much shelf appeal, but the contents are attractive and good quality.  This card game fits nicely into a compact box with a magnetic closure.  Play is 20 mins with 3 people.  

I am sure we will be playing this game again and again and again.

Played again after a long hiatus, wasn't as bad as the first time, but still not good.

The game itself is rather boring with the theme, however there is an interesting engine under there that could stand to be used in a different game.

A second problem i had with it is that you are essentially granted the win if you get 2 dice.  There are just not enough points to go around.

This feels very similar to For Sale - a fairly smooth-playing card auction game in two phases (the first is drafting rather than auction though).

It's not as simple, but decent. There's a material memory element, but I don't mind that in a game like this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Not many games work equally good with 2 players than with 4, but Biblios does the trick. It's short, challenging, requires different tactics every time you play it according to the situation and how the cards come, luck doesn't play a big part and it's always interesting until the final moments.

First time we played it with 4, I even almost managed a whitewash (winning all five dice), while I expected to only win one or two. And the other time around I came 1 point short for several dice, finally ending with nothing. Everything is possible !

I like the design of this game and as always I love efficiency in components. This game is basically just a deck of card and 5 dice. The two different phases are an interesting concept but don't really work for me.

I enjoy the first part of the game, the drafting of the cards. It has a little bit of push-your-luck in it which I like. The auction phase though feels disconnected and I don't really enjoy. The manipulation of the dice is also a bit underwhelming.

A simple to learn and clever card game.  Great for Gamers and a good vehicle to introduce non-gamers to a more diverse game world.  Played with non-gamers and parents who only knew card games like Hearts, Spades, Poker and UNO.  It was a little tough at first breaking up their card game paradigm, but soon they were right in the swing of it.  Themeatic card art, and good quality cards.  The only negative is the card lay out.  The art dominates the card and the text on the card (naming the type of card) is small font and is hard to read as it is layered on the art. It makes the cards confusing for new players and hard to read in general.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Wonderful artwork.  Quality bits (cards, scoring board, and dice).  Very nice pacing.  I highly recommend this game.  The pacing is a bit reminiscent of For Sale.  There's 2 halves of the game -- part one: you collect cards (but also have to give a card to each other player), part two: a stack of cards get auctioned off, paid for by the cards you got in the first round.  Simple to learn, clear rules, painful decisions.  Everything a game should be...

Gyakorlatilag egyetlen mechanikára leszűkített microgame. Szetteket gyűjtünk, minden csavar nélkül, az egyetlen érdekességet a lapok elosztásának módja jelenti. Ez elég egyedi. Viszont a játék szinte teljesen tervezhetetlen, ami némileg megbocsájtható tekintve, hogy 20-30 perc alatt lemegy. Viszont egy ilyen egyszerű játékba kéne valami spiritusz ahhoz, hogy gyakran az asztalra tudjon kerülni. Ez itt hiányzik sajnos.

Biblios is an enjoyable filler that although hindered by its repetitious and somewhat random first phase is celebrated for its second phase auction mechanic and quick, easy-going gameplay.  The whole presentation is nice and this easily fits into any gamer's collection if they have a soft spot for quick-playing auction games like For Sale or the like. It is also one of the few auction games that works decently for two players! Quite pleased to add this to my collection of fillers. Solid in that regard.

An amazing filler game.  It feels a little like For Sale in that there are two halves to the game and it centers around a bidding mechanic.  In the first half you take turns dividing cards among players and an auction pool trying to create the best hand to have bidding power in the second.  In the second half you use your hand to acquire more cards in order to gain majorities in one of five categories.  There are some agonizing decisions to be made, and it plays very fast.

First off. let me say I got this game from the designer in a "free just pay shipping" try it promotion. I asked for it because it sounded interesting. This game is VERY good! We have only played it 2 player so far but it was a lot of fun. the mechanics are solid and the game seems well balanced as games always seem to come out close. The choices during the donation phase can be almost AP causing in a fun way. The "one card at a time" draw is what does it. Keep it? auction it? give it away? Arrgg..

The quality is very good for a self-publish. I really like the card quality. There are a few of the cards that are cut off center causing a white edge on some of the backs but it's not too big a problem and I would imagine would be addressed in a bigger print run. Which I hope this game gets. It is worth it. 

The game plays in a relatively small space. My wife and I played it a few times on a 2 person cafe table while our kids were in a pottery class and there was room to spare.

I'm disappointed with Biblios especially because it has received such high praise. I find the gift phase boring & then the auction phase feels unsatisfying after building up your hand.

finally played & I love it.  My husband can't figure out how I keep winning.  I explained I let him waste his gold playing around with the dice & I take 3 if not 4 of the categories!  In time I hope he will develop his owm counter-strategy.  Win or lose this is a fun little game.

Fun push your luck decisions for first half with the second half auction providing a surprising amount of tension.   Exciting not knowing the winner (since some cards are removed and not known) until the count up.   Great use of dice for this small filler to give it a bigger feel.   Plays great with two which I didn't expect.  Certainly one of the best in this time frame and category.

RATING: 7
Extremely dry card game with nice theme and inventive design. The two-stage-gameplay is a great idea. First you distribute the cards among the players one by one, second you bid the remains. And in the end you score majorities.

I liked it and the only reason I probably won't play it again is its dryness. Apart of that - a good game.

RATING: 6
Players draft cards for points in order to win each of five objectives or that they can use as currency in an auction of the cards rejected during the draft. Once all cards have been drafted and auctioned, players compare their total points in each of the five objectives. Each objective will be worth some VP which can be influenced during the draft and auction by certain cards. The winner is the player with the most VPs.

Lite filler game, some luck in the draft, bluffing. Good components with Ok art.

This is one of those games that is so simple to learn and play and yet quite clever. It's a great way to analyze your opponent (it's fun one on one) and try to get into their head. There is a bit of luck to it (due to removing some cards from the deck at the beginning based on number of players) so that detracts from the strategy a bit, but after the first few rounds you have some clues as to what your opponent is trying to do. At its core, it's a card counting/press your luck game, but it's fun!

The card drafting phase here is a ho-hum way to build your initial hand and draw pile. The real fun, I mean pain, I mean fun, begins during the auction phase. You pay for cards you may need with other cards you may need. An exquisite light game that competes with Love Letter as my favorite filler. In fact, the term filler isn't good enough for this short game

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
It's a good game, I just don't see why anyone would play it over For Sale. They're both quick fillers with 2 phases where the second phase is an auction where your resources are defined in the first phase, except that I much prefer the first phase of For Sale and For Sale is faster.My issues with the first phase of Biblios is firstly regarding randomness. I like push your luck as a mechanism, but there's not much to it here: either you hope to get a better card or settle. There's no pacing arch or interesting probabilities or extra reward for pushing your luck further. My second issue is the church cards. Depending on the player count and when they show up they will be either very important or completely useless, and while that is an interesting arch, that doesn't change the fact that they're so boring to get sometimes, especially the first turn. My final issue is the biggest one, and that is that the decisions in this game are almost all completely obvious. If you draw a 1 gold, you're going to put it in the middle. If you're in the middle of the game and you see a good card for a colour you haven't focused on, you shouldn't bother. If you have a choice between a 3, 2 or 1 gold from the middle, you're going to take the 3. Maybe the game is just worse at 4 players because of the amount of gold cards in the deck, but they are just so static and uninteresting. Also, the competition for majorities is so fierce at 4 players that you have to pick 1 or 2 colours and really go for it in order to be competitive, which leaves out a lot of interesting decisionmaking. It would have been a lot more interesting if there was a way to trade cards with each other, to incentivise picking that 4 brown even though you don't have any other browns.The second phase of the game, I really like. I like that you can throw away your worst colours to win a gold card that may help you get that final edge for a colour you really care about. It's interesting to try to inflate the price of a card you don't want and how you can try to force your opponent to exhaust their money to get a lead in a colour you know there are better cards for coming up later. It's just that first phase that I feel drags on and is uninteresting, but it's so vital for the second phase that the game in its entirety just isn't as fun for me as it could have been.

Biblios (3rd English edition) is easy to learn, fast to play, and reasonably fun with 2 players. I admire the genius of the game designer. He created a game that seems completely different from the other games I've played, but after just one game I felt like I could play it competently. 

My husband and I both tend toward analysis paralysis and poor memory. These problems were not an issue in this smoothly flowing game, where decisions are limited in each turn and a quick glance at your hand and the board is all you need when making a decision. 

I would like to try this game with more players because the mechanisms of the gift and auction phases would probably be much more exciting than they are with 2.

This game is beautifully produced, with evocative artwork, solid components, and a lovely box to hold everything. My only complaint is that the cards are just a little too stiff and shiny. This game is one of the few in my collection that I consider to be a candidate for card sleeves. I will probably play it often enough to make sleeving the cards worthwhile.

I ordered the game directly from the designer. He shipped the game within hours of my order and provided timely email updates about the process. Even if your FLGS or OLGS carries the game, I recommend the direct-order route for outstanding service.

There's nothing wrong with Scripts and Scribes, but there's also nothing to grab me and pull me back.  What makes the game work is the mystery surrounding how many cards are out there for the various majorities.  Some cards are randomly removed, and others will be thrown away during bidding.

Played three or four times so far.  I'm willing to play again, but wouldn't ever request it.

Biblios is a good game to play with casual gamers.  This game is easy to understand, with some luck because you draw cards from a deck.

The goal of the game is to have the most point at the end of the game.  For each of the 5 colors, the player with the highest total on his cards will win the dice corresponding to that color.  Dices are not roll, it only indicate the number of points each color worth.  Some card allow players to increase or decrease value of a particular color.
On your turn you draw a number of cards (number of player + 1) one by one and for each of them you have to decide what to do with it.  You must keep one card for yourself, put a card away for the auction phase later and put the rest of the card face up on the table.  These card will be taken by your opponnent (they choose a card in clockwise order).
After the deck of cards is exhausted you shuffle the cards that were put away for the auction phase.
Each of these cards are put to auction one by one.  If the card is one of the 5 color or a priest card (special card to change value of a dice) they are bought with gold card.  If the card is a gold (value from 1 to 3) players bid with a number of cards they want to discard instead of paying with gold.

When auction deck is exhausted the game is over.  For each of the 5 color, you check who has more points in that particular color and takes the die of that color.  Each player add the total of his dice and the player with the highest total wins the game.

Well I was suppose to write a review for this one, but it was denied for being to short.  I personally think there are way too many 'long reviews' around here and not enough short concise reviews.  (most rules do not need to be rehashed).

So here goes, my comment/review:

I'm becoming a big fan of independently produced games.  This is no disappointment.  The cards, box, etc. are of good quality.  The rules are well written (although they may be on to small side print wise).  The box is a perfect size for the components. Is this really all that?  

It's a really interesting auction game.  I very much enjoy the two very distinct phases to this game.  The first phase, is really a 'drafting' of the hands (pot).  In this phase you get an interesting choice of what you want versus what you are willing to give your opponents, versus what you think you might want to bid for in the second phase of the game. 

The second phase is building your scoring hand for the end.  The cards in your hand can be used to 'bid' on cards or just saved for end game scoring.  Gold cards are used to buy paintings and Bishops.  And any combination of cards can be used to 'buy' gold cards.  Gold cards are only used in tie breakers at the end, so they are often better to use then save.  But, again, you don't know if something better is going to com up later.

End scoring is simple.  Who ever has built the best collection in each of the 5 categories scores the value of that 'collection'.  The only problem is those values will change based on the selection of the bishops.  All collections start at a value of 3.  When Bishops come into play either in the 1st or 2nd phase.  The bump up or down the value of 1 or 2 collections.

That's the game.  Fun, quick game.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles:
Joc ràpid (duració de filler) que combina mecàniques de "draft" i de subasta en dues fases diferenciades del joc. En una primera fase, cada jugador roba de la baralla de cartes tantes cartes com jugadors més 1 d'una en una. Una d'aquestes cartes la col·loca apart (formant el mazo de subasta), una altre la col·loca davant seu (per robarla a la mà) i les restants les col·loca al mig de la taula (per que les agafin la resta de jugadors en ordre). Es segueix fins que s'acabin totes les cartes i, posteriorment, es pasa a subastar d'una en una les cartes del mazo de subasta. 
Sembla que l'atzar en el ordre en el que es roben les cartes pot ser molt determinant, no m'acaba de convencer que, un cop has escollit quina carta et quedes, la resta les agafen la resta de jugadors sense que puguis fer res (pot pasar que et quedis una carta més o menys bona, enviis un altre al mazo de subastes i les restants que treguis siguin molt millors, de manera que surten beneficiats els altres jugadors).
Tot i que no té res a veure, m'ha recordat (en profunditat i en tipus de joc) al Speicherstadt i, en el mecanisme de draft, al 7 Wonders.

Nice little filler card game. Drafting part has a push-your-luck feeling to it.

It's a light, but fun bidding game with a good mechanic for distributing the deck of cards. One of my favorite non-special power card games. Mine is the far superior Scripts and Scribes version, which actually evokes the dark, dank atmosphere of a medieval monastery.

RATING: 2.5
Played it once, and don't have a strong desire to play it again.  The total points that there can be in the game range from 5 to 30 (5 categories, each with a score of 1 to 6).  That seems like a really low number to divide among 4 players, and leads to the score being very tight.  That is, small perturbations can cause huge differences in final ranking.  That's bad, because a player with a great memory can keep track of all the cards that have been drafted, which leads to a disproportionally huge advantage.

It may seem like a fun game to new gamers who are used to this kind of low-quality fare, but memory games don't interest me that much when there are so many great games to play instead.

2-player game. Oh, wow! That was fun. We played three games in a row. Rules were easy to learn. We stayed engaged throughout. It wasn't until after when I was looking at the card disbursement that we realized that different colors have different totals. (Would have been nice to know, but it was my own oversight.) Looking forward to seeing how the game might be different with three or four players.

S&S is great: it's an intriguing and subtle light-medium game. Each game plays out differently, and is as enjoyable as the next. Every four games or so I seem to discover another layer to the game. It is very fun to press your luck with misdirection.

Gamer commandos who play fast and furious probably won't like this game. It will feel mechanical and empty to them.

Biblios is a light, quick, and fun game.  However, it is more of a filler game or a game that could be used with less serious gamers (although serious gamers will most likely enjoy it, as well).

In brief, it is essentially a card drafting game with an auction element to it.

It's funny.  Even though I have not played it for a couple of months now, I am again feeling the urge again after composing this review.

I don't like this game with a ton of push your luck element. You are trying to make a good deck of yours and a bad of others and after that making bids for the cards. But as the dice value changer cards are going is almost pure luck and almost no skill at all. I don't recommend this game to anyone to play it nor i want to play it again.

AFTER 2 PLAYS:
Simple but fun game.  Collect cards of the same color to get point value of the dice of the matching color.  Values start a 3 per dice, but can go up or down from there.

Extremely nice production value, this is a beautiful game with thick, glossy cards, large colored dice and a beautiful box with magnetic flap.

Scripts and Scribes, where For Sale style auction snap valuation combines with set collection, and value management for a very nice little auction game.

For many years the best game from Dr. Finn's private publications, this has been reissued, but I am happy to have an earlier version of the game.

I like this game, but it seems a bit heavy for casual play with my wife, as there's a bit much going on here for her enjoyment, but it'a clever game and a rather good one.

2-phase game of collectors trying to get the most valuable art pieces.
In turn, until out of cards in draw deck, draw cards and deal some to your opponents, one to you, one "for later auction". Influence current price for each art category accordingly.
Then all go for an auction of the cards that were left aside, using the cards you took in the first phase to pay (hopefully not too much!) to win each auction - or try to make a "friend" pay more...

RATING: 8
(10/2012) Deceptively simple rules, yet profound play that finishes within 20-30 minutes. How is it that a card game with relatively sparse components be so much fun to play? The card selection mechanic is similar to Merchants of Amsterdam, where the active player will draw cards, one at a time, deciding if they are going to keep it, put it up for auction, or put it in a pile where it will be given away, without looking at the next card. The choices are deliciously agonizing, and some memorization is needed to remember what cards were placed in the auction pile. The cards are one of five suits, in two or three distinct ranks, or money of one of three denominations, or church cards that can alter the relative value of one of the five suits. After all player have selected their cards, either by secretly or openly drafting them, the auction cards are auctioned off one at a time. If it is a suit card, then money is bid. If it is a money card, then number of suit cards are bid. In the center, there are five dies representing the relative value of each suit. As mentioned before, the church cards can increase or decrease the value by altering the die. In the end, whomever has the highest total in card rank in each suit will win the respective die value. It is possible for a player to win several dies. Highest total value of the dies determines the winner.

The theme is thin, as in our first games we did not recognize nor care what the suits represented. In that matter, the theme could be anything. Rules and components were reasonably good. All in all, this is a fun, compact game that doesn't feel like a filler. Initial rating is an '8', with room to move up.

Update (02/02/13) 5 plays: Liked it so much, I got my own copy. Cards are very stiff and shiny--nice at first, but very easy to smudge with finger oils, and the edges chip after one play! Strongly recommend sleeving this one, and soon!

Update (11/16/13) 11 plays: Played two 2-player games, each at under 15 minutes--the gift phase taking 5 minutes, and the auction phase taking 10 minutes. Not bad for a quick 2-player filler!

Update (04/18/2015) 25 plays: Solid, solid, solid card drafting game. Bound to be one of the future "classics". Solid "8".

▲1張面向下放在自己面前
▲1張面向下放在拍賣牌堆上
▲其餘的牌面向上放在公共區域
◎抽牌時一次抽一張，分配完後再抽第二張，依此類推，直到抽完指定的張數。
◎分配結束後玩家將置於面前的牌加入手牌，其餘的人順時針依序選擇1張公共區域的牌加入手牌。
◎待所有人都增加一張手牌後，玩家回合結束，輪到左手邊的玩家抽牌分配，持續進行到抽牌堆被抽完為止。
2.拍賣階段
◎將拍賣牌堆洗牌形成新的抽牌堆。
◎由禮物階段的起始玩家開始，翻開拍賣牌堆最上方的那張牌，面向上置於桌面中央進行拍賣。
◎起始玩家翻牌前將抽牌堆置於自己面前，以免忘記輪到誰的回合。

教會卡
◎在遊戲中任何時候(無論是禮物階段選手牌選到或是競標階段得到)玩家得到教會卡，遊戲暫停，立刻執行教會卡的效果，或選擇不執行直接棄牌。
◎教會卡可以改變各類別骰子的點數，左上角的數字代表增減的點數，右上角代表可以調整幾顆骰子(如果是2顆必需是不同顏色的骰子)。
◎如果是+1/-1，則玩家可以自行選擇要+1或是-1。
◎教會卡執行效果後置入棄牌堆。

遊戲結束
◎當所有的牌都被買走或置入棄牌堆，遊戲結束開始記分。
◎玩家計算自己的手牌在各顏色的分數，每一個顏色分數最高的玩家，可以拿走該顏色的骰子，置於自己面前(維持骰子的點數不變)。
◎如果玩家的手牌分數平手，則比較手牌右下角的英文字母，最接近A的玩家贏得該顏色的骰子。
◎將贏得的骰子點數相加，點數最多的玩家獲勝；如果平手，則手牌有最多黃金的玩家獲勝；若平手，比較手牌僧侶(咖啡色)的分數(平手比字母)；若還是平手，則依照圖板從左到右的順序，接著比顏料(藍色)的分數，直到分出勝負為止。

A typical good(but not great) German style game: an enjoyable set of good mechanics lacking a solid theme. I like the aspect of conversion between money cards & category Cards, which is clever.

At the core the game has the annoying take-that feature, but which is washed out by the amount random factor.

An auction game similar to For Sale, but made a little more complicated/interesting by forcing choices of what to do with the cards you draw (i.e. keep, auction, put up for purchase).

First played June 23rd, 2008. Taught in 10min, played in 20min with two players. This is an interesting push your luck game. Balance seems to be weighted in luck, however there is some strategy in it. The board consists of 5 categories of which 2 are workers(values 2-4; 2 of 4's, 3 3's, 4 2's) and 3 are resources(values 1-2; 7 1's, and 2 2's) each start with a die value of 3 and can go 1 to 6. Deck is comprised of: 9 of each of the 5 category cards and 9 of the bishop cards (lets you change the value plus/minus when owned) which have different values on them. There are also 33 gold cards with values of 1,2,3(11 of each). In a two player game, remove 2 of each gold value card. Shuffle the remaining cards and randomally remove 21 cards. For the first phase of the game, each player on their turn takes three cards and evaluates them one at a time. You have three options. Give the card to your opponent, place it in the bidding pile, and keep the card for yourself. Do each of these actions once each. If you take a bishop card, immediatly do the adjustment of the value plus or minus of one of the categories. If you get a plus/minus two, you must change two categories. Rotate clockwise around until all cards have been drawn. The second phase you bid on cards. Shuffle the cards set aside for bidding. Each player may bid higher or pass. Once you pass, you are out of the bidding. For gold card, you bid category cards. For category card, you bid an amount of gold(no change is made if you don't have exact). After the bidding is over, the player who has the combine high points of each category gets that die's value. Ties are set to the side. The winner is the player with the highest score.

I really like the game. Simple. Fast. Different. Played two games, and my opponent did not like it at all. She thought it was anticlimactic and that it left her thinking "Why?" I think it has more strategy and depth than she's giving it credit for, and I think it would be more challenging with three or four players. 

Also, I like the components. Although the theme has no practical value, it makes very interesting images. However, the card colors for Scribes and Scrolls are too similar.

My wife and I enjoy quick and relaxing card games. This one fits the bill perfectly. Really enjoy the drafting and auction mechanics. Nice box too!

Update: Has flown right by our other current favourite card game, Jaipur, in number of plays. Can't get enough of this game at the moment. Jaipur is still holding its own though.

Update: Two years later and over 40 plays and Biblios continues to deliver. You're never sure if you've won or lost until the cards are down. I love that bit of uncertainty in this game. Always exciting to the end.

It's also a superb 2-player game. Have yet to play with more.

May08: Pretty high initial rating from me.  The theme is completely forgettable, but the game is a lot of fun.  It's a self published game, but the cards and components are perfectly alright by me.  The actual game is an auction and set collection game, but pretty far removed from Ra.  You spend the first half of the game doing a fun card drafting bit that will induce moans and groans.  The second half is a reasonably traditional auction game.  It makes sure that the items are all off different value to the different players however.  I enjoyed it and look forward to trying it with some more players.

My wife hasn't been too taken with it.  I'm partial to the bluffing aspects at this time.

RATING: 6
Decent filler.  It has a For Sale feel to it, as there are two very distinct phases to the game.  For a self published card game, the components are surprisingly good.  However, the artwork is overly dark and does not conjure up the elaborate and beautiful illustrations that you might encounter in say, a medieval bible.  A game that was a little easier on the eyes, with this theme, might have picked up a point.  As it stands, For Sale is more elegant, and with a limit of four players, there is not a lot to distinguish this bit of filler from other good options.

Always good to have this one around when both boys are home. My older son doesn't enjoy the games as much, but Biblios is interesting, can allow for relaxed talk during game play and is a great game that gets all of us to the table. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Biblios is an enjoyable mix of a light card-drafting game and a light auction game. I stress "light" because much of the potential information needed to make a good decision is hidden, turning what could be a very tactical game into more of a luck-pushing affair.

Still, it provides some enjoyable moments (especially in the auction phase) and is very accessible to new players, making it a good game night warm-up game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Rated after 3 2-player games and 2 3-player games.  A neat little card-based drafting/auction game.  The two-phase gameplay (drafting and then auction) works very well as you auction gold cards for point cards (and manipulators) and (any) cards for gold cards. The game only lasts one round so it is quick playing.  Works very well for two.  Three player is just as much fun, and the battle for the workers and resources is intensified.

Initial Rating : 8.5 (April 2011)

I really like this light medium card game, it plays so quickly but I´m always satisfied with it. I´m not sure why but I find myself with a longing to play Biblios. It is a deceptively simple game but it has a surprising depth, you also need to exercise you memory, it has an auction and a partial secret draft phase and it has a little of “take that” in it too. All its mechanics work very well together and it has lots of interesting decisions in the game. Good tension :D.

The game box is also pretty cool.

All in all, I recommend this game. One of the best card games out there.

I still like Biblios a lot. This is one of the few games my mother will play with me and that is a huge plus. I’m downgrading its rating so it better conforms to the BGG rating policies. It is now a 7.0 for me. A good game I’m usually willing to play. 

It has some luck in it, but in general, the best player will win. 

My only complaint is that, once I sleeved all the cards, they won´t fit into the box :(.

Great game!  One of only two games I will sleeve.  The cards are a hard material that tends to chip and are hard to shuffle.  And that smell was overwhelming at first.  We had to spread them out on newspaper in the basement for a week before we could play the first time.  I love the way this plays with the the 2 phases (gift and auction) in about 25 minutes.  It is hard to tell who is winning.  Sometimes when you alter the dice thinking you are sabotaging the other players, you are really only hurting yourself.  The end is always a surprise!

Unsleeved the cards...let them chip, who cares?  As long as they all get played, it will be even wear on the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quick and simple game in two halves, the first being a slice-the-pie game in which players have to decide which cards to keep for themselves, which to give to the others and which to hold back for the second half of the game in which the held back cards are auctioned off. 

The twist is that as you draw cards one-by-one you can't view all the cards you'll draw on your turn before deciding what to do with them, i.e. you have to decide what to do with each card as you draw it. This means that if you draw a half-decent card you have to decide whether to keep it or not without knowing whether there's a better one just waiting to be drawn - you can only keep one card for yourself each turn.

Biblios is a decent set collection/auction game. The mechanics of the "gift phase" (i.e., seeding the players' hands and auction area) make for a unique and welcome approach instead of the usual random card deal. Fairly smooth flow and rather low-conflict interaction. Overall a fun, light game with an original theme, albeit thinly implemented.

Scripts and Scribes 2nd ed. - VHS case edition.  Glad to have this quick 'filler' card game in my collection. I like the idea of the Bishop cards that are dealt with as soon as 'acquired' as they alter the course of victory, I will deal at least two to the auction pile to purchase later.  There's a comfortable amount of control and flexibility in this game regardless of the obvious randomness in card draw.  Rating is for 2-player games.

NOTE TO SELF:  Go for acquiring the 'high' cards during the donation phase and focus on certain 'suite' cards during the auction phase, all while collecting 'gold' cards to purchase with... sounds easy enough. 


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Book-like packaging hides a well thought out drafting game where you must choose the right card for yourself, your opponents… and a second deck of cards to be auctioned after the draft, all in hopes of getting victory points for the most of each colour. This is one game where you really need to pay attention to what other players are doing too, and it's quite intense as well as fun.

BIG PLUS: easy to learn, quick play, interactive, well designed
MINUS: (none)

ESSENTIAL to those who want a nice starter game that runs on different mechanics and is playable by all ages.

Biblios is a great card game which mixes up a couple of my favorite mechanics, auctions and set collection.  The "gifting" phase is really unique and feels good, deciding whether to take that first card you see, or hoping something better comes up for you, but not for your opponents...  And then that whole feeling of if you should put it in auction and hope you get it later.  I really like that.  The auction is really good too.  Switching between paying gold for cards and then paying cards for gold, definite fun.  There's a lot of great things going for this one and I enjoy it extensively.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I just don't understand the hype. Agonizing decisions? Come on! You place a card in one of three places. The auction phase is even more boring than the initial gift phase. Some people have compared this to For Sale. I didn't like that one either. Gameplay is too simple, not enough choices.

2015-04-14: Initial rating as a 6. I was relatively surprised given the hype surrounding the game. I played a 3-player game and it simply fell flat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game is played in two phases, a drafting phase where a card is handed to each player and to an auction pile each turn and then an auction phase where the auction pile is handed out. You bid for cards with gold cards or cards from your hand. You are trying to get the highest value in 5 colors and the points each color is worth is adjustable with cards during the game.

There's nothing at all wrong with it, I just don't think it is a great deal of fun. There isn't a lot of joy in just handing out cards and then the auctions are not that interesting. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Engaging, fun little card game. Bumped to 9 due to amazing art of release as Biblios (used to be Scripts & Scribes), and because the theme is so close to my heart.  Some of my favorite graphic design in a game,  awesome "book-box" and nice multi-colored dice.  However I have to ding it for some quality issues: cards chip even with gentle tile shuffle, so have to be sleeved.  Also card-well in insert only has thumb holes half way down, which makes the thumb holes useless; you have to turn the whole thing upside down to get the cards out.  Finally there is the notoriously strong smell when new that makes some people physically ill.

This is a card collection game where only the majority in each suit wins. You get the number of points on the die associated with the suit. A handful of cards allow changing the numbers on the dice. During the selection round the dealer can decide to keep it, send it for auction, or put it out for the other players. Many of the cards are used as coins. The coins are used to buy cards during the auction round. There is some observation and memory element in tracking what colors other players prefer. This is a nice filler.

An easy enough game to take on but there's not much to it with two players.  Could be a bit more nasty with more players and depends on them.

Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't; but it's a lot of fun either way.

Coming from a small American publisher this one is very hard to get on this side of a pond and being "just" another filler card game in the vein of For Sale or Coloretto it wasn't worth the effort of obtaining it. Having had the chance to play it at Spiel 2010 I'm still not sure if it is worth buying now that it gets a European publisher. It's good already with two players which is rare in this category but in the end it might not be unique enough in its rules-to-depth ratio or fun factor.

A nice surprise of a game.  It's self published, but the cards are of pretty good quality.  I'm not the biggest fan of the art (though it is definitely original) or the (very thin) theme, but it works and is a fun little game.  I'd like to try it a little more to see how it is with 2 and 3.  With 4 it seemed like maybe we were bidding too high, as you really had to choose your battles wisely.  It's a good filler that I look forward to trying again.

Is there such a thing as a "light brain burner"?  There is a lot of luck in this game, but I'm betting the person with the best memory and statistics background is probably always going to win this.  That makes it sound like the game isn't fun, but it is great fun because of the agonizing decisions.

Amazing game. Have played a couple of times and was pleasantly surprise at how most of the games ended. The fight for a dice is always either particularly close (all down to the alphabet order) or surprisingly easy (having a 1 or 2 point card when everyone else has discarded theirs). 

Plays well with any number of players.

Most epic play recorded: 12 points off 3 dice, with two unexpected alphabet order wins.

This game is not the deepest game in the world so you can't compare it to a multi-layered work such as Caverna or Terra Mystica.  It is a filler, and the best of fillers in my opinion.  If you are looking for something with quite a bit of suspense and tactics that you can play in under 20 min, I have not played a better game.  It is definitely more tactics than strategy.  

It scales so well with 2-4 players.  I love it most with two but it is interesting that with 4 you have a completely different game at hand.  I was told that it is similar to For Sale except that this one doesn't get old after a while. I often have everyone asking if we can play it again, immediately after finishing one game.  

One of the best parts of the game is the self induced tension.  Almost like you are your own worst enemy, second guessing all your moves. "Was that the best move I could have done, should I have given that card instead of the other one?"  

Its one of those games that upon finishing, everyone wants to get their secrets off their chest. "I was hoping you would do this, but you went for that color so I pulled back."  "I was bluffing the whole time on those last three bids.  You totally went for it. That freed up the church card I needed." That kinda stuff.  


I can't give this game a 9 or 10 in comparing all board games, but in its own category/genre I definitely would.  I don't know a better 20min game.

Tense, quick and fun. These are the things I would choose to describe Biblios. The game has two parts and the mix of them works great. The first part is push your luck. You draw cards one by one and put them into auction, your hand or give it to other players. Since you only look at one card at a time you constantly wonder if you can get something better or it is time to stop pushing and get something mediocre. The second part is much more intense! The auction is a simple one but every card discarded gives more and more information to everyone and there is tension until the last card of the auction since that might change who wins a suit and thus the winner of the game. Great filler game, highly recommend it.

This is often the auction game I introduce to players after For Sale or No Thanks, really nice mechanic where there are two types of auctions during the auction phase of the game, you bid number of cards for money cards, and bid money for the cards that come up in the auction. It's definitely a lighter game/filler, but the hidden information (cards other players are holding) and the auctions keep the game tense.

二人からできる軽い競りゲーム。でも、二人だと相手の手がかなりわかるので実際は三人か四人が面白い人数と思われる。二人でもそこそこ面白いと思う。
コンポーネントも良く、所有欲が満たされるゲーム。「写本と修道士」の頃の絵の方が私ごのみだが、新版も悪くない。カードは傷みやすそうな飲んで、スリープは必須。ただし、スリープに入れると内箱に収まらないのが残念。
短時間で終わるので非常に軽く感じて繰り返しプレイできる。気になることが3点ある。
まず、この軽さかもしれない。軽い競りゲームとしては「For Sale」があるが、どっこいどっこいの軽さ。
二つ目は、このシステムとテーマは全く関連性が薄いと思う。
三つ目は、サイコロがこの厳粛なテーマをぶち壊していると思う。もっと別な形で表現した方が良かった。

I'm so happy! I've finally found a 2nd game everyone in my family likes. Biblios now sits with Carcassonne.

Why do they like it? The wait between turns is small, and even the "wait" has the draft! So, players are always playing.

No knowing who is ahead throughout the game is also fun! I thought I was going to win, but my daughter's 2 red cards beat my 6! What fun!

Biblios is a well-designed card game in which you go through the deck in two different ways, first by drawing cards and hoping you make the right decision about what to give away and what to keep, and second by auctioning off cards one at a time, setting yourself up with enough of the right colors to score points and win. The game is all about the fact that you never see the next card off the top of the deck until you have made a decision about the first one. I enjoyed this one for a while, but ultimately there were too many hidden factors for me and my group. You could almost call this a "memory game," but that would only account for the things you saw your opponents taking. I definitely appreciate the lean design and excellent components, but eventually this one had to go.

[b]Biblios[/b] is auction game divided in 2 parts, with 5 different color dice that act as final points at the end of the game. Changing those dice through cards (+1 or -1) /based on what colors players have/expect to get/other players might have/ players prepare dice for the end of the game.

At the end of the game, in every of the 5 colors, person who has the most points in that color takes that color dye and who has the most points on dice is the winner.
In first part of the game players take cards for free (with some luck) and leave one card per turn for second part of the game, while in second part of the game players compete for cards left from first part using auction mechanism.

Clever, fun, relatively easy to explain, but needs at least game or two in order to fully understand whats going on.

RATING: 6
Very cleaver card game (the dice that are included are only used to keep scores) that is simple to teach and learn. The initial deal phase has some press your luck elements, but there is some (as in a little) strategy that, although could hardly guarantee a win, can certainly help your odds. During the 2nd auction phase, good use of cards and some memory as to what has already been played can be helpful in making educated guess. Usually it only take winning two categories to win, so a focused approach on one (with some bishop help) or two categories is all that may be needed. Overall a light and enjoyable game – especially for the cost.

reprint by Iello : biblios


This is a great cardgame. Don't get fooled by the fact that it uses dice. They are only needed to determine the value of the workers or resources by means of adjustments by playing the bisshop's cards.

Gameplay is pretty quick. And there is no risk for the game being slowed down by AP players.

Randomising the deck by leaving some cards out works here great and I guess it will offer plenty of replay value and second guessing.

If there is a reprint I''ll probably buy it

This game is just flat out excellent.  There is a good deal of luck but the auction stage of the game really makes you forget about that.  Each time it has come out it's been kept out for several plays.  That rarely happens with our gaming sessions.

A quite nice one. There aren't that many new ideas, but at least the card drafting feels kind of new. A lot of luck included, but that doesn't bother me because the game goes to filler -category. What bothers me more, is that most of the choices are too obvious so don't expect any hard decisions. But still, I'm ready to play every now and then.

Not that bad, actually. The card-drafting is made well, but the last part - the auction - isn't (not interesting enough).

You are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.

I love card games, though many can grow tiresome if you are having an unlucky day. The way you fill your hand in this one takes a lot of the luck out of it. After the fun drafting mechanic, then there's a fun little auction mechanic. I'm usually not into auctions, but this game does it well. It's not a heavy game, but it's a perfect length and it's compact.

I keep hearing about how this game is like For Sale. I can see the similarities people draw the connection from, but in player count, play mechanics, and play experience it is nothing like it.

It's a more opaque, silent, calculating experience. It is an ok game in its own right, though I'm not sure if there's anything brilliant in here that truly captures my attention.

There are simpler and shorter games that offer as much or more depth and interest than this, especially with two players.

Several games, 3p & 4p.  Yep, this game was as good as I expected.  Which is to say, it wasn't real deep, and you're at the mercy of fate drawing from the deck (and the other players paying attention...).  I think it's a pretty good moderate length card game, and would like to play more.

reminds me a little of "a lengthier For Sale" with more strategy cards involved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Excellent filler which can be played in 15 minutes or less after the first play.  First part is a bit of card drafting in a sense as you look at one card at a time and choose if you wish to place it in the common area (which means the card will be selected by someone else), the auction pool (which comes up in phase 2 of the game), or in your own hand.  Phase two is the auction and you use gold cards to purchase nongold cards in the auction and just bid a number of cards to win the gold cards in the auction.  In order to win, you seek to win majorities in enough of the 5 different areas to earn the number of points on the die (which can fluctuate based on the bishops that can make the value go up or down by one).  Somewhat reminiscent of For Sale, it brings in a couple interesting twists that make it unique.

Fast, simple, extremely difficult choices.  This is a great auctioning game, and ended up replacing Modern Art in my collection for best auction/bidding game.  

The artwork could be better, theme is pretty much pasted on (albeit a great theme in my opinion), and the overall components leave something to be desired, but in the end they are all functional and put together in a nice package. 

Hopefully sometime down the road I can pickup the better quality Biblios for my collection.

Clever card game that seems a lot more straightforward than it is. (Unfortunately, it possibly for the cards to fall a certain way and a single play not really reveal everything that's going on.)

This game is just a lot of fun with two players. The game balance was obviously very seriously and well thought out, and there's enough unknown and unknowable in any given game that you have to take chances to win. A solid game, and definitely happy to have it in my collection.

In all fairness, I'm not a fan of games that involve bidding.  However, I was bored long before we got to the bidding phase of this game. It's a set collection game, but very little is involved in collecting sets. The game included dice, which is misleading, because you don't get to roll them.  
If you want to do mindless set collection, play Morels, which isn't great, but isn't awful and the game is designed to work for two people.  If you want extremely fun set collection, play Bonanza. 
Another note is that that I only played two-player.  It was boring.  Very boring. It might be fun with three or four players.  But there are so many good games out there that I probably will never give it a shot.

Good game, marvelously presented.  I can see my rating go up, though we had some concerns over really how much control you have over things.  But as a quick and engaging 30 minute game, it fits the bill.
Update: a long overdue update. This is a game we have struggled to like as a gaming playing couple, I can get a sense of where the cards are, even though I don't know exactly. My wife just doesn't get that feeling and feels very frustrated by it, just not knowing how much power she needs in a number to win, or at least challenge. It has been on the cusp of the  trade pile, though I still think it is a good game and it is one I will play when asked, with some neat mechanics.

I love a well-designed auction mechanic.  Biblios has it.  This short, easy-to-teach filler is wonderful.  It plays so fast, is highly interactive, and has push-your-luck written all over it.  It depends a good deal on one's ability to bluff.  Try to deplete your opponents stockpile of cash during the auction phase for cards that don't help you, so they are less able to bid on the cards you really want!

I am a little un-impressed with the markable cards, which are made of very thick and brittle card stock.  After a few very gentle shuffles the finish "chipped" off a some of the card corners.  Therefore, you should definitely sleeve this with a premium Fantasy Flight or Ultra Pro "standard card game" sleeve, as I have done.  TTFN

This game is supereasy to teach and to play and it is superfast. It is also superfun, because it is full of very interesting decisions that allways have an effect to every player.

This game is super! My favourite filler-game!

Clever drafting mechanic where the active player can look at a card, and either put it out for others to draft or bury it to bid on it later.  After the cards are drafted, you auction off cards that were placed into the auction pile.  You are trying to get majorities in the color cards in the game and score points based on the dice corresponding to the color.  Purple cards allow you to moving victory points up and down throughout the game.  

Simple filler with good quality components and different theme.  I like this game a lot.

[i]Biblios[/i] is as much if not more about playing your opponent than the game.  As a result, this quick little game requires two similarly experience players playing against each other multiple times.  Occasional plays of this game will not tease out it's brilliance.  However, occasional plays is probably all it will get as there are many other games that I'd rather put on the table.

RATING: 6.5
The game has two phases, drafting and auction.  The two phases work together in synergy.  However, I find the drafting phase to be somewhat slow and repetitious, probably due to the fact that it is done one card at a time from a rather large draw pile.  I enjoy auction mechanics and this one is no exception.  The game as a whole is good, entertaining, and a good filler.  There is just something about it that I don't quite grasp and as I said the drafting phase feels not entirely satisfying.
A note about the components.  The Iello version looks better and is of better quality (bigger dice, better art) but is not as clear as the original. In the original it's much easier to see and keep track of which suits and cards the other players take because they are monochrome instead of multichrome.  I prefer the legibility and clarity to the aesthetic appeal.

AWESOME light-weight medieval scriptorium auction bluffing card game for 2 or more players. Highly addicting. A good bit of tension and decision making. Very quick setup, play and easy rules. Nice box in the shape of a book. Dice are used as changeable victory point counters. Collect colored cards a fraction more than your opponent. Increase the value of your chosen color. Know when to spend cards or money in auction. Half luck - half strategy, half solitaire - half interaction, highly recommended for couples.

This game is probably my FAVORITE filler of all time.  I think it is brilliant.  It is a set collection game where you are fighting to collect the most of 5 color sets.  What is brilliant is that each turn you look at cards, one at a time, and get to keep one, gift one to each player, and set one aside for an auction later.  Then, each of the 5 colors have a value (represented by dice) that is constantly changing.  So you may win "red" in the end, but red may only be worth 1 point.  It is a very well balanced game that takes maybe 20 minutes.  I love to teach it.  I love to play it.  I think it's the perfect mix of skill and luck.

Rules seemed like they could have used an extra example or two.  Took me reading it twice to get it which normally doesn't happen.

As soon as I played this it got put in the bag of games I would always take out to games night/games event with me list.
The game is simple enough to teach to those who are not regular gamers as well as offering a little bit of strategy for those who play often.  More often than not we will play several games of this back to back.
At first it feels a little slow, but soon picks up pace as everyone 'gets' the idea of the game, typically we knock a game out with 4 players in around 1/2 hour, making it a great warm up or filler game.  
If you wanted to take this as a travel game you could easily do away with the little board and just back 4 dice and a pack of cards.
Certainly a game which will be staying in my collection.

It's a quick little drafting/auction game. Fun to mess with the value of the dies as you find out what suits people are trying to collect. I also enjoy bluffing during the auction phase. We play a variant in which a failed bluff results in the winner of the auction picks a random card from the bluffer's hand. This allows for more bluffing and ultimately more fun!

So it scales well, plays quick, and is fun. What more could you ask for?

Four words: Mind Games and Card Counting. Okay so you can't really count all of the cards (and you never know exactly what is excluded via # of players) but you can have a feel for them. You want others to think they have enough chance to not lower your color, but not have enough to win etc. Fun quick game that has good strategy going on.

If I polled my whole family as to their favourite game this I am sure would come out of the combined list on top. It is the only game everyone will always settle on to play. The theme, I am sure, means absolutely nothing to any of them. They just love beating me because I am terrible at it!

You play as monks controlling the redistribution of bibliotheca materials. Inks, parchments, forbidden tomes and such like. The game is played in two stages. The first you redistribute the goods. One to each player and one to the auction pile, but you do this one at a time so you cannot look at the cards and then decide what goes where. Then surprisingly the auction pile is auctioned. The auction works very well, even with two, and brings a fantastic tension to the game. 

As always with good games, there are a few wrinkles to the game play. The value of the sets you are seeking a majority in can be altered during gameplay and this for me is where the fun is at. Just don't end up winning the one set you have spent most of the game devaluing (difficult to do I know, but I have managed it on several occasions!).

Just a great game, I don't think I have played it with anyone who hasn't enjoyed it. I like the way the distribution at the start slowly sucks people into the game with a few interesting decisions before the crunchy, nervous tension of trying to work out what you can win in the auction, and what cards you can bid to win more money to buy different cards in upcoming auctions, because you know the card you want and put on the auction pile at the start of the game must be coming up soon, and you really, really, really want it now, and if you had known how the game was going to go would never have put it up for auction in the first place.

Simply excellent. Probably one of my top 10 games. Definitely a keeper until I finally win a game then I will probably become unbearable and someone else will sell it!

UPDATE

Absolutely love this game for what it is, a very light, quick auction card game. Played 4 player which I think is at it's best, but it is also good with 2 or 3. My wife won again which she always seems to do at this game. Still at least that way it gets requested a lot! 

I am not generally keen on auction games but this and Speicherstadt I do enjoy .... and now maybe one other further down the list!

It plays well for 2, and it's fast enough that you can play more than once in a row. My one complaint would be that, even though there is strategy involved, there's also a lot of luck and randomness at least in the 2-player game where some cards are removed from the game.

Pretty good, but needs a little more polish/developement. I'd prefer to see the scoring dice (an odd choice for a component, since you don't roll them) replaced by 1st & 2nd place scoring cards (or counters, whatever). I don't like the all-or-nothing scoring.

A very simple game that forces you to make tough decisions from the first draw to the last auction.  It’s a 30 minute game that is going to take several plays to master and scales well for 3 to 4 players.  My only issue with the game is I can see it getting old after excessive amount of plays and I wouldn’t recommend the game for two players.

RATING: 10
This game is brilliant. It feels nothing like any other card game I've ever played, and it's a blast to play. Biblios is one of my favorite card games.

The theme is original and nicely expressed through the gameplay, and the two-phase structure makes for a game that's somehow both calm -- like a monastery -- and packed with tough decisions.

Like Stone Age and Lords of Scotland, Biblios hits a strategy/tactics sweet spot for me. You can go in with a plan, and carry that plan through the game, but you'll have to change that plan based on what comes up and what the other players do.

On top of all that, the cards and artwork are gorgeous and the components are top-notch. Compare this to a $20 Steve Jackson card game that's just a deck of average cards, and there's no comparison.

This is a ton of game in a small, easy-to-teach package, and everyone I've introduced it to -- from non-gamers to fairly hardcore gamers -- has enjoyed it. It's addictive, too!

A near perfect filler game. Do I keep this card or send it to auction and hope I get something better, what if I give my opponent something good?  This has become THE game my wife and I play when we want something quick and fun with just enough meat to make you sweat.  Awesome.  The only negative is that this is super abstract.  You WILL end up referring to the cards by color rather than theme and it really this could be any theme because it's all about the mechanics.

A minor classic - a strong, addictive filler that plays equally well from 2-4. Most filler games have little real strategy and few decisions - this one gives you deep things to think about from beginning to end. It requires a strategic plan, flexibility, memory and sharp tactics all at once.

Very cool quick auction game that works well with lower player counts than auction games usually do, even with two. Dull 'theme' but the gameplay is great. I wouldn't say it's as fun as For Sale though.

This is a nifty little bidding game.  There's a nice tension as players bluff and vie for control of different scoring tokens.  Occasionally, it has turned out that the auction phase was unnecessary because it wouldn't change the outcome of the game, but at least this is not obvious while playing.

The non gamers in my family REALLY enjoy this game. You are trying to collect a majority of a certain color of cards....the dice in the middle of the board dictate how much your collection is currently worth at the end of the game. However, other players are able to influence a colors point value throughout the game.

RATING: 7.5
The first time you play you'll probably have no idea how much to bid for cards, which I think is a common issue with auction games.  It's difficult to have a feel for the flow of the game and what cards are worth when you've never played.  But once you do this game really opens up as a highly engaging draft and auction game.  Each decision matters and bluffing can drive your opponents to overspend, which in turn reduces their ability to compete for cards that come afterward.

8 - 01/11/2015 - Cool! I had been following this on internet reviews, and found very good comments. My first feelings after three games are equally positive. I like the quick turnover among player and the interaction throught the final auction. Although the drawing of cards is random, the auction potentially re-evaluates everything you did until there, but you must still play with strategy to acquire the right cards. Simple rules, solid mechanics, nice interaction among players, deep enough, from my experience it plays well with both two and three players.
9 - 18/04/2017 - I have played this also with four players. The game scales greatly keeping the same engagement and playing time with any numbers of players. My most recent games confirmed it is a good game for non-gamers and occasional players, and still fun for habitual players. With four players it becomes a bit more difficult to count others' card, and you lose a bit of control on your score, but it is still a very enjoyable experience.

[i]Biblios[/i] is by far my favorite 20-30 minute "filler" game.  While merely okay with four players and good with three, it is fantastic as a one-on-one game.

With two players, there are an abundance of opportunities for strategic bidding, bluffing, passing, and card dumping.  Many times during the auction phase, I have given up cards for gold from a color I was confident I would win with as little as a single card.  It is possible to fall behind during the drafting phase and come back to win if you are able to read the relative strength of your opponent's categories.  This is not as easy to accomplish in a 3-4 player game.

This game is so simple, but so clever.  The first phase allows for some really fun push-your-luck moments of trying to decide which cards to keep and which to hide in the auction, possibly giving your opponents even better cards.  The second phase is a pretty basic auction, but with some hidden-card bids to keep everyone guessing.  It's really hard to know how well you're doing until the end, especially with the random cards removed from the game.  Great little game overall.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A fun little game, of auctions (and thus also groupthink) and card counting and risk taking.

Bit too short and volatile for me to care much about the outcome, which means that the rating suffers for me. But it's a really interesting game, the style of which was very new to me and thus felt very fresh.

I like it, somehow wish it had a bit more maybe? And a bit more granular scoring, which might dilute tension but give more feeling of control? I don't know. Also, I'd consider playing with trackable cards open, should make for a more tense affair I think, but ultimately this is pure preference. It's strange how I've turned around on the question of HTI, mostly because I now at least try to track, so it is painful to see the mistakes fellow players make when they don't in turn...

RATING: 8.5
This is a very clever design which allows you to have a lot of good decisions in a short amount of time, with meaningful player interaction, bidding, and push your luck elements.  As good as it is, I've found myself surprised that I enjoy it's cousin, Scripts & Scribes: The Dice Game, as much or better.  Very satisfying, meaty filler.

RATING: 6
I have some serious doubts (which are, like all of my doubts, probably unfounded) that the auction phase of the game has a significant enough influence on the final outcome.  I think gold cards are almost criminally useless in the end game, as well.  I wouldn't turn down a few more games of this just to learn how wrong I am in my overall misgivings.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Excellent card game for it's time frame. Mechanically, it's a solid game. It loses a ratings point to be completely abstract and themeless. But I always enjoy playing it.

Really enjoyed this one...

Played 3-player with the family, and everyone enjoyed it.  There were interesting decisions to make, and there was a fun push-your-luck edge to the card "allocation" process.

I also love the theme and muted color scheme - it is not nfor everybody, I know.

Solid, solid filler, along the lines of [gameid=172] (which I think is great). Plenty of tough choices along the way, although not too tough that my 8-year-old couldn't play along. Cute little package too. Don't be fooled by my rating; I definitely recommend this.

One of those games that's a bit confusing to hear the rules but clicks immediately when you play it. Each round is filled with interesting choices and weighting risk/reward, though the memory aspect included does not fit my tastes. Still a very elegant game that I'll be happy to show my friends, especially if they like collecting like I do.

RATING: 7.5
The drafting mechanic in this game is excellent. There is also a lot of guessing games and trying to read other people's intentions and strategy. 

I've played it with 2,3, and 4 players. It is pretty bad with only 2 players. I would never play it with just 2. On the other hand I found it too chaotic with 4 players. Still more fun than 2, but at this point in time I think it is best with 3.

High bang-for-the-buck with this one even if the theme is pasted on. Also Abbots and books don't exactly get your blood pumping. Now if it had been monks brewing...

was hesitant to get this as i wasn't really a big fan of auction type games. so far, we've had great sessions with it and is growing to one of my consistent games to play.

RATING: 8
The theme isn't especially fitting, as it's more of a stock market than something holy or Christian, but that's OK for a board game, I guess, since fun is supposed to be at the centre of one (at least in most cases). Although a lot of luck is implemented in this game, it is nonetheless - surprisingly - a very entertaining game which requires a little strategic thinking (but almost none) in order to try and win. When it's your turn, you pick up cards, whereby you can keep one of them. But it isn't as simple as that! When picking up those cards, you can only view them one at a time and you're forced to make the decision whether you should keep it, give it away to the players or for the auction. You choose how far you go. Will you take a moderate but nevertheless promising card for yourself or will you give it up in the hopes of getting a better one? As you can see, it is mostly luck and although in most cases I despise games which are made of pure luck, this is one exception which somehow manages to make me interested and extremely entertained… perhaps because the luck part isn't as obvious and seemingly hidden. Concerning the strategic part, two of five of the various categories have a best card with a value of four while the best card of the other three categories is only two. So often players will try to get the first two categories which are actually harder to get, which will attract most players and which aren't better at all than the other three categories. So you will be forced to select your focus which will determine your victory or failure.

Decent fun, but the idea behind the game, the theme, and the look by IELLO are more fun and more special than the game itself. Furthermore, good memory is required to play the game well and I dislike this gaming element.

After a handful of 2-player plays, I'm in love. The tension, the tough choices about which colors to keep, which colors to dump on, how much to bid, how to signal opponents to throw them off the scent of what you're doing...there's just so much good stuff going on here, and it all happens inside about 15 minutes.

Wow.

Not bad. I've long wanted to try this, and I wasn't disappointed (but neither was I awed). I scored exactly zero points in my first game, as I didn't have much of a clue. Will try again, some day.

RATING: 6
Fairly interesting card game in two phases: drafting (the best, most refreshing part) followed by auctions (oh well). Quite a bit of subtle thinking required. Works well for two players, although randomly omitting 21 cards per game results in much uncertainty. Well produced ([i]Biblios[/i] version) with an intriguing theme that unfortunately is merely tacked onto abstract card play. [3 plays; traded]

A fabulous little card game. Quick, simple, elegant. The game is designed around playing your opponent, and taking risks with auctioning of cards. Great game for traveling too. I have played it a couple of times with more players, and while I still like it, it falls more to a 8 with more than 2. Which is rather odd for a game with an auction mechanic.

Wow! An excellent game (after one play). Reminds me of Modern Art for some reason. Granted there's little computation required in this one, but the set collection, slight bluffing, sensing what other players value, and manipulating "stocks" are all common elements. It's supposedly good with two, a big plus.

Very interesting game of drafting followed by auctioning.   Normally, one of these two approaches occur prior to playing a game.  in this one, the two approaches are put together and that IS the game. Nothing else quite like it.  Very innovative.

This is a charming little game which combines a neat, push-your-luck drafting phase with a laser-focused auction phase.  It's been an instant hit with everyone to whom I've shown it.  A top-10 filler for sure!

Is coming out to be printed by a major publisher.

You are working to be majority in different classes. The majority at the end of the game earns the points. Sum the points, and you have your end score.

You take a card, choose a card for auction, and the rest pick a card. Once all cards are obtained, then the auction cards are sold after which the game scores are tallied.

Ingenious game. Rarely an auction works with only two players but in biblios that is not a problem. Use of dices as indicators of different card types value and the way you can manipulate the dices raises this game above many other auction games. Only cons are crappy card material and quite long set up time for such a compact game.

2 évig szerettem volna megszerezni és kipróbálni a játékot. Végre újra kiadták, így megkaparinthattam egy példányt magamnak!
Rendkívüli izgalommal álltam neki játszani, és mégsem csalódtam! Ketten játszottuk barátnőmmel, és annyira tetszett neki, hogy rögtön visszavágót kért, sőt azonnal kijelentette, hogy játszani akar még vele. Ezt még társas nem váltotta ki belőle (najó, talán a Ticket to Ride, az a kedvence). 
Egy 2 fős játék 20 perc alatt simán lemegy, végig érdekes döntések elé állít, fenntartva a figyelmet egészen a végső pontozásig, hisz addig egyáltalán nem lehetünk biztosak a dolgunkban.
Érzésre a játék hasonlít a Ticket to Ride-hoz (szett gyűjtés, titkos információk), ezért aki azt szereti, ezt is biztosan imádni fogja!
Blöffölés, kockáztatás, izgalom mind egy kis dobozban. De még milyen dobozban!!!
Alig várom, hogy többen is játsszuk!

This is the game "For Sale" on steroids.  It layers in a bit more complexity into a familiar "two phase" game play.  It also offers players the ability to directly impact the scoring higher or lower via the dice modifiers.

Combine the gameplay with the game length and minimal setup time, and you have a winner.

Sharp, fast, interesting auction game with a few minor annoyances. The good stuff: the mechanism is really simple, easy to teach, and leads to some real drama later in the game as the cards go up for auction. Also, the art is great--even though it's basically an abstract card game the pictures of books being burned or talked up at the pulpit are great. -- The not-good: the current edition has absymally cheap thin cards. And the scoring mechanism is too minimalist--with the dice only inching up or down by a point, and only 5 opportunities for scoring, games can be decided by trivially low scores. I don't like games that have massive points inflation (where you're scoring regularly in triple digits), but having all that work go into such minuscule differences in outome isn't good either. (Basically, it needs to have the dice as multipliers on a base, not additive, so that small differences lead to wider disparities in results.) -- This is about 3/4ths of a truly brilliant game, but it's not quite there. I still like it, though.

At first glance of this game i thought, oh is that it.. After loads of solid reviews i decided to go for it never the less..
The gameplay is super simple, can teach most people within 5-10 minutes..
The great thing about this game is the tension in the decisions you have to make every time you have that deck of cards in front of you.. And it still exciting and entertaining when its not your turn, watching other peoples faces as they draw the cards and think.. Oh shit i should've pushed my luck at little more ect.
This is a solid Small game that takes little time to play..

I don't know if I need another auction game in my collection but Biblios seems to offer a lot of gameplay in a short time. Which cards do I keep and which do I give away? How much can I afford to bid? How will the values of the cards change? Sounds like plenty of room for agonizing decisions.

主題:0.6
用中古世紀修道院收集各項宗教圖書(含禁書)來包裝的收集成套外加競標的遊戲，遊戲機制與主題勉強搭到一點點邊，畢竟成套收集可以套用很多主題(例如車子、珠寶..等)，只能說是個套用部相關主題的卡片競標遊戲!

美術:0.6
遊戲外盒的設計很有質感，卡片畫風有普普，沒有自己的特色(個人偏好有自己畫風的美工)，骰子不是用來骰的，而是用來翻轉，這一點出乎意料之外。

規則:0.8
規則簡單，好講解，遊戲時沒有太多爭議點，只是為什麼卡牌大小是要靠英文字的順序來比較，我覺得要是卡片針對同一種類分數的書，每張內容呈現書本不同的精緻度，來做為比較大小分數的依據，會更有帶入感!另外比較讓人困擾的一點就是宗教牌的進場發動時間，讓人小迷惑一會，簡單來說規則沒有太大的爭議點!帶新手完競標遊戲這一款很好入手，略比房地產拍賣高階一點!

設置:1
擺好圖板、骰子、卡片就可以開始玩，算是很方便!

路線:0.4 
算是走一步算一步的計算遊戲 見招拆招 遊戲中程才能比較明確自己的集牌路線。

互動:0.8 
互動性算高，有一點點針對性，當有人跟你湊同樣的牌時，就是考驗自己的決斷力，是要繼續博下去，還是要自己轉換路線，湊別種牌。

個人:0.6 假如湊牌類型可以其他不同主題的版本 本人可能會更加喜歡

朋友:0.6 大致反應還不錯 但僅僅不錯而已。

想玩:0.6 可能要等一陣子才會開來玩 做為小朋友的競標進階遊戲，還算是不錯的選擇。

收藏:0.6 外盒的很像書本，有閒錢可以收一下

總分:6.6
講評:湊牌過程中有一點點的小心機，可以快速多玩幾場，算是本遊戲的優點，就我而言，就像大老二一樣，玩的時候很刺激，但玩過後一點也回想不起來剛剛怎麼贏的。不像有些經典策略遊戲，會讓你玩過一場就印象深刻。

The first card game I played outside the standard card games and I really enjoyed it. The two phases are quite different, the gifting phase and then the auction phase, but both allow you to work towards creating a winning hand. The dice are used to try and influence the market in your favour to achieve victory. Not difficult to learn for new players.

Biblios has its moments. When you raise a bid thinking another player will overbid and they do. When you raise a bid thinking another player will overbid and they don't. When you dump all your cards of a suit except one because every other player has seemingly dumped all theirs to auction for gold and you can win the suit with a single "1". Unfortunately said moments are too rare and only happen during the second half of the game; the first one being a draft-ish memory exercise where not a lot of interesting decisions happen and that can overstay its welcome at higher player counts. Globally, I'd say the game is very inoffensive: you're unlikely to have a bad time, you're unlikely to have a great time. But you'd probably rather play anything else you fancy.

It doesn't help that in the average game, dice values are irrelevant and it becomes a single matter of winning at an Euclidean division of 5 by the amount of players.

Edit (mars 2016): note de 7.8 (décembre 2013) revue à la baisse. Pax a remplacé Biblios dans nos habitudes de jeu.

***

Excellent jeu, idéal à deux ou trois joueurs. Jouable également à 4.

À deux joueurs, beaucoup de cartes sont initialement écartées. Il est possible de faire des matchs "deux de trois" avec les mêmes cartes...

RATING: 7
A very abstract game. It is easy to explain and plays fast, therefore very suitable as a filler. There seems to be strategies, but it's mostly about memorizing what colors people are hoarding, and decisions that is quite obvious. Manipulating dice is the most interesting part of the game, the rest of it is some standard filler stuff. I do recommend the 3-player game however.

Love it! Biblios surprised us and we found ourselves laughing at the unexpected results everytime we played. A very easy game to learn and play, with surprisingly difficult decisions and risk taking. Love the simple mechanics and 2 phase play. Lovely art and compact packaging.

I really enjoyed the mechanics in this simple game. I think it is a very quick-fun game for 3 or 4 players.  With only 2 it falls short. It can be addictive in its simplicity, kind of Splendor-like, but since Biblios came first, I guess I should say Splendor is Biblios-like.

RATING: 5.5
Decent filler. People heralded this as a superior For Sale, but I was not crazy about this. I liked For Sale's art better, and I think I like auction mechanic more than blind draft too. That said, this game is possibly (probably?) deeper than For Sale at least... but I still like For Sale more because of the art mainly. (Yes, I know its shallow, but I don't grade fillers on their play as strongly). I think the push your luck draft isn't really phenomenal or anything - its okay, but it feels chancey, which I'm not crazy for. I've also lately been thinking that fillers should be less than 20 minutes ideally, and this approaches 30.

Plays: 3+

After about 10 or so plays of this, I find the game is a bit too light for my taste and Im not a fan of the push your luck. I dont like that some can draw in the 4s and such while others may keep drawing 1 golds or something. Id prefer more control and mitigation.

PROs: This is a cool little auction game where you have to be shrewd and do your best to card count so you know whether (A) you have a shot at gaining a majority value of cards in a certain suit, and (B) whether it's worth it to bid for things to obtain that goal.

CONs: This can be a mean game. I would never recommend this for non-gamers or people you want to introduce into the hobby. It's mean and punishing. I like that about the game, but I'm sure it would be frustrating to someone new to gaming.

It only takes about 20 minutes, but even that seems like a whole lot of fuss for the tiny handful of victory points that get doled out at the end.  It's probably better with a smaller number of players.  The real pity here is that the first half is a very neat system of card distribution that could have been put to better use in a different game, rather than the boring auction phase which follows.

Pretty great.  Enjoy the back and forth - a lot to think about and with the added uncertainty of the random cards removed from the deck, you can never be absolutely sure what's out there.  All of this is offset by fast play with no down time.  Prefer this to Lost Cities.  Only thing that doesn't sit right is the inordinate amount of scoring ties (7-7 again!) and the less-than-satisfying tie-breaker rules.  Regardless, highly recommended!

What an amazing little game.  Equal parts strategy and luck.  The theme is excellent, the components are high quality, and the game itself scales well for all player numbers.  Right now, there doesn't seem to be an ideal card type to go for, but the random card discard mitigates the ability to predict precisely what cards are in the game at any one time.

Biblios is a set collection game with two parts to game play.  The first section is every player giving out 5 cards; one to themselves, one to the auction, and three to opposing players.  The second section is actually auctioning out the cards that were set apart in the beginning.  

At the end everyone compares the numbers they have collected from the five different collections and win points if they were the leader depending on the die corresponding to that set.  

The game is pretty simple with minimal amount of decisions to make during play.  I could play it again, but find 'For Sale' to have more decisions and also fit this time-frame.

RATING: 7.5
Great game. We used to play it in the office as a filler. Works well even with non gamers. There's a tendency for it to feel same-y after some plays and does not have infinite replay value. However, this happens close to the 40 game mark and you do get your value out of the game.

I gifted it away to Office friends - I will never refuse a game of this.

RATING: 8
I feel fortunate to have gotten in on the first purchases of this game.  I was looking to add an auction game to my collection and was intending to purchase Ra.  Enter the BGG community reviews.  After reading the review, I decided that the game sounded like fun, cost less, and albeit pasted on, I liked the theme better.

Every card draw makes me think and I like that.  Auctioning presents it's own dilemmas, not easily solved.  I'm sure that it will not catch up with the auspicious Ra, but I saved some $$ and got a nice little filler.

Why this is not a 10:
-> I do not want to play this all the time
-> Auction games tire out for me after a while.
+ I will suggest it and would not turn a game down, especially as it is short and [so far] works with non-gamers.

A rather interesting filler card game. Even though it's really just about collecting majorities in five card colors, there are actual, meaningful decisions to make. The game length is quite optimal: The game ends just before it gets repetitive.

The brown and black card colors are too similar, I always mix them up.

The colors and layout of the Iello version are even weaker from a usability standpoint.

Grande delusione. Non un gioco pessimo ma mi aspettavo di più da questo gioco, siamo di fronte invece ad un gioco di carte molto semplice nelle dinamiche che in sostanza è una collezione oggetti e soprattutto trovo che il caso la faccia abbastanza da padrone. All'inizio vedo cinque dadi e storco il naso, comprendo che non si lanceranno e mi torna il sorriso, poi però vedo che la partita si basa tutta sulla pesca di carte (4 o 5) e torno perplesso e effettivamente molto sta nella pesca delle carte. Materiali e confezione del gioco sono eleganti e le dimensioni corrette, la grafica e la scelta dei colori (marrone, arancio e rosso si confondono) invece mi lasciano perplesso. così come il tentativo, fallito, di ambientazione.

My go-to filler of choice. It replaced For Sale for me.

Verdict:

What I Like: Easy to teach. Tense bidding. Rich, interesting decisions (for a short filler). Great components.

What I Don't Like: The theme is a minor letdown for three reasons. One, it's boring/dry as dirt. Two, it has no correlation with actual game mechanics. Three, I'm a Christian theological teacher so people tend to get the wrong idea of what they're in for when I first suggest playing "Biblios".

Woo-Hoo! Reprinted! [-]Really cool box, too.[/-] Wrong: once the cards are taken out of their cellophane, they are able to slip out of the box. Grr... it [i]does[/i] look good. And the cards look spectacular! (Caveat: the cards need to be sleeved, otherwise they get marked almost instantly).
Biblios is a good game - simple enough to teach with ease, but it requires good strategy and observation of the other players. Gameplay is very fast and interesting. Players compete to have the greatest influence over five seperate "suits" at game end; the value of each suit may change during play, and there are both auction and card drafting mechanics.

[b]Biblios[/b] was sold via auction 4/4/15. 
Received in a math trade 11/10/14.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]In the end, for my wife and I, this game didn't stand up to repeated play. Most of my plays were with 2 and I definitely think Biblios plays better with more, so I am quite surprised that it's so highly recommended for 2. The drafting of cards worked well with 2, but I found the dice manipulation to usually be a back and forth affair with very little difference in the numbers (most of our 2p games ended with a bunch of 3's and maybe a 2 and 4 thrown in). With 3 or 4 I t would gladly play it, but since it was mainly a 2p game I played with my wife I ended up trading it.

*I lowered my rating to a 6 based on the 2p experience, with 3 or 4 I would rate it an 8 and highly recommend playing it. [/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- An auction game that plays very well with 2
- An excellent cafe game [i](small footprint)[/i]
- Easy to teach since you can teach each phase of the game separately [i](drafting/auction phases) [/i]
- Interesting draft mechanic [i](you must choose a card for yourself, the auction piple and put cards out for the other players to choose)[/i].

心得:
禮物階段很有趣
不過能算的部分不少，但是一開始抽掉的牌讓推測性更不準 
可能要稍微記牌才能玩得好
規則:
*起始所有骰面 3，根據人數先平均棄不同幣值黃金牌，在暗抽棄對應數量牌
*遊戲先開始禮物階段，結束接競標階段，結束該按顏色牌數總合最高得骰子分數，平手比卡牌右下英文字母，最靠近A獲勝
1.禮物階段，由主動玩家抽(玩家數+1)張牌，一張一張抽，抽完就要決定放在哪，一張蓋著給自己，一張蓋著成為競標牌庫，其他開著，抽完給下面順位輪流拿，然後順時鐘換主動玩家
2.競標階段要洗牌，在由第一階段的起始玩家開始開競標牌庫，由主動玩家下家開始出價，建議用牌庫當作主動玩家指示物，競標只要pass就不能再加入
*標到不能付要逞罰， 其他玩家從該玩家手牌隨機抽一張，該競標牌重標，該玩家不能加入競標，緩合點的是隨機棄一張牌
*競標金幣卡出蓋著的卡牌張數，其它出金幣不找零
*最後分數平手比錢，在平手就看誰贏了monk骰(咖啡色)

One of the best bidding/auction games. Sure, the theme may not fit AT ALL with the core mechanics, but Biblios plays so fast it's hard to naysay. Plus, it's a good decompression after big bloated 4x games or heavy Euros. It's tailor-made for variations and a slew of your own house rules: adding a fifth player, rolling all the die before you start (so they don't all start at 3), gifting one face down to your opponents, and extra punishments for overbidding on cards. Enjoyed by both veteran gamers and brand new players, Biblios is always a hoot.

RATING: 6
It’s a card collecting majorities game, competing to have the highest face value in each of 5 suits. The first half, establishing your starting hand, whizzes along. A turn here is to keep 1 card secretly, assign 1 to the auction pile secretly, and place 1 for each other player openly and watch what they take in clockwise order. The secrecy means there's enough hidden to ensure no one is quite sure exactly what suits people are aspiring to win. You can also claim gold cards, and once the deck is run through, these are used in the bidding phase, where each of the cards in the auction pile are now auctioned off, 1 at a time. This is where things become a bit more obvious about who's going for what. All the while, bishop interrupt cards are coming out which allow people to move the VP award for a suit of their choosing up or down by 1, also tipping hands. These tend to be pretty key and keenly fought over. If everyone fights, then things should net out pretty much the same, but if you let these go, you'll suddenly find that the suits you're collecting are worth much less than the others and you'll be out of it. The climax is the revelation at the end where all reveal, the suits are won, the VPs awarded and the game is won. There are too many secret cards to ever be sure about what your chances are, unless you go for overkill in a suit, but that means you won't likely win a second suit and you could be done over by someone who squeaks out wins in two suits and claims two lots of VPs. There’s enough randomness therefore for you to want to keep things pacey and fun, and means you don't want to take it too seriously, but there are probably too many auctions for a game that you don’t want to take too seriously. It therefore doesn't easily fall into a filler type category, but it's not weighty either. A mixed bag type of game, where you don't really feel like you've made interesting decisions, and that the cards you get kind of drift your way and then you hope things turn out well. Meaning there's not a lot of satisfaction at the end of it.

It is a very light filler.  I bought it because of the hype.  But I don't find the auction as exciting as all the video reviewers made it out to be.  Non-gamers like it so it could be a gateway game.  The theme and art is kinda boring for kids.  But every adult we have introduced the game to has liked it.

[b]Neat Light-Medium Hand-management Majority-Scoring 30-minute Card Game.[/b] The auctions don't feel typical, but I like that. Games can get a little wicked. It is the players' choices within the mechanism's framework which makes this game cool.

Not a gateway game, IMHO. Family Game-ish. Beer-N-Pretzels-ish.

This game is meatier than For Sale, but it doesn't accomodate 5-6 players as For Sale does. For Sale also is a good gateway game, while Biblios is not, IMHO.

I do appreciate the theme historically, but prefer stamp-collecting as it's theme.

I like the format and the mechanic that forces you to make choices as you go through the deck and I like the auction round as well, but I guess my criticism is that the strategy management part of the game is just not that compelling.  The ability to adjust the values of certain cards is a critical timing thing. seems like many of those cards come too early in the game for you to have a clear feel for the best strategy.

9/25/11 - I was curious to try this game with my wife since it has  some similar elements to some games we already play. Initial play through the game left me wondering if the game has to much money. When we played the bidding for cards wasn't as intense as I felt it should have been. Maybe that might have been due to it being our first time through the game. It is a fun game and I look forward to trying it some more. I give it a 7 at this time.

10/29/11 - I played it with 3 players and during the bidding phase, the cards were going for more money. The game is more interesting with 3 as you have to watch more closely to the cards people are collecting. I can't wait to try it with 4.

11/02/11 - Now I got some 4 player games played with 3 new players. They liked the two phases of the game and the bidding got intense when the Church cards became available. Bibilios is just fun to play with 2, 3 or 4. I feel the game has more interaction at 3 and 4 players but I wouldn't refuse a play at any number. A solid game that I am raising my rating to an 8.

I played this once as a two player game and at two it does not work that well. You must try to get the majority in each color to gain points at the end. During the turn you draw one more card then players and keep one, pass one to the opponent and place one for later auction. At two there is very little going on and the game is somewhat dull. Next I played it at four and it was not much better. Random drafting and luck, a little better at four, but there are better filler games.

RATING: 8
Sort of a step up from For Sale as it also features two phases.  The drafting (first) phase is interesting in that you have to draft a card, place one in the auction pile, and donate a card for each opponent to draft.  The kicker is that you draw one at a time and decide where to allocate each card as it appears.  So there is a push-your-luck element to the draft.  The auction phase has a nice dose of bluffing mixed with hand management as you sometimes will discard cards your opponents believe you are strong in to acquire extra gold.  You may end up dominating a color with far fewer influence points than they were calculating.  The only thing holding this game back is that the theme makes zero sense.  Just pretend it's a traditional card game.  It deserves it's status as an excellent filler and it does have a "Knizian" flare to it.

RATING: 6
Biblios is card game with two distinct parts.  In the first part, a player draws a number of cards sequentially and assigns them one-by-one to either himself, an offer for the other players to draft, or an auction pile to be distributed in the second half of the game.  Then in the second half of the game, players use money cards they acquired to buy cards in the auction pile (again, one-by-one).  The player having the greatest value of each of the colors of the game earns a number of points that starts at 3 but can be manipulated by in-game events.  So it's kind of like a partially-blind majority game with no points for runners up.  Some interesting ideas here, but ultimately it didn't do much for me.

I've read some people saying that a good memory would always make you win on Biblios, but then I guess my friends and I don't have a good memory, because it always come really close, also contradicting that statement is that you never know what the other players gave to the others or left to the bidding.

Biblios has two phases: A drafting phase and a Bidding phase, the Drafting defines the Bidding, and the points come to colored dice that give value to the cards you have. This values can vary throughout the game.

It is a really engaging fun game of assuming, pushing your luck and then bidding and bluffing. 

Fun and Quick, almost impossible to play just once.

PnP version from Artscow. 
--- Re-themed into Stamp collection --- 


Initial game (3 players)was a little bit tough to grasp the concept but the second game that followed was a lot smoother. We still need more time to get down exactly how much money we should put down for the actual cards. I suspect it will be fun with more than 2 players but I will give 2 player a try when my girlfriend is up for another game. 

---- Update ----
After reading the rules from the file section I've noticed we didn't play this game right. The distribution of common pool was done each turn. We did it at the end of Donation phase. I suspect playing with the right rule will make the game more tight.

---- Update ----
This is a fun game. It feels like For Sale but to me it's better. I enjoy games with a mix of public and hidden information and the ability to distribute the cards in this game to give an impression that each player is in control. In For Sale most things are public knowledge and the only thing that makes that game great is the simultaneous card selection.

---- Update ----
Rating from 9 to 8. I guess overtime filler games' ratings do drop since the depth just isn't there for me to keep wanting to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
My rating is for the game as a 2p, for which the game seems unbalanced bordering on broken. If you're playing 3p+, YMMV.

For 2p, you must randomly eliminate cards from the deck (you must do this to play fewer than the maximum number of participants, but for 2p, a lot of cards are removed) Because this card removal is random, there are so few of each card, that you often mostly or completely eliminate some suits, which degrades game play - sometimes substantially. Of 7 or 8 plays at 2p, three have been wonky and one was essentially broken. We stopped the game about 2/3 of the way through and looked through the card deck and found that one suit was completely missing. We tried designing a balanced 2p deck, but found that knowing which cards were in the relatively small play deck gave the game play an odd feel. We put it on a shelf a year or so ago with the intent of figuring out some house rules to fix things or simply to play with all the cards but modify scoring to keep the game from being too free with resources at a full card count, but in the interim have found other small filler 2p like Builders & Morels & Splendor & Aton... and so sold Biblios.

Probably Steve Finn's pinnacle game. With its two phases you completely switch gears mid game from a draft to an auction and it works beautifully. This is my go to game for after work, when I want to play a game with depth but don't want to play anything complicated. Highly recommended.

RATING: 2
Bah! Remind me never to make game purchasing decisions solely based on a bgg rating! My partner and I were trying to decide between a few games and wrongly chose this one. Why? Because it's boring and has hardly any strategy! There are two phases in this game. The first phase is basically just drafting cards. That goes on and on and on until the deck is done. Boring. The second phase is auctioning the cards that weren't chosen in the draft. The auction keeps going until there are no more cards. Then add up the cards you have and determine the winner. And that's the game. We played it a few times just to make sure we really hated it. It is just terrible with two players and was a bit better with three. It would probably be best with four. But I can't even imagine why so many like this game. I think I prefer Zombie Dice. Hugely disappointed.

Works everywhere everytime!!. Adequate luck and each game plays differently as  you try to guess what other players might have more or less of. The best moment I had with this game was when I bluffed I had a lot of one color once and the other player( although playing for the first time so feel sorry for him) discarded all those color cards to get coins in auction and I won that color with a single card.
The only auction game I have (except ofcourse Monopoly whose only fun part is auction).

This is a great auction game with a fair dose of bluffing involved. It plays quickly and is small enough to be easily portable. It's also a lot of fun for two players, even though it plays just as well with 3 or 4. 

About the only criticism is that the backstory of trying to set up the most renowned scriptorium is really just pasted on. The game itself is rather abstract. Generally I do prefer a bit more theme in my games, but Biblios is still a blast, in spite of this rather minor flaw.

Good, heavy filler where you play as monks, improving your monastery's library. Points are scored from five dice in different colors, placed on a minimal board. The player with the most points in each color get points equal to the dice current value.

The deck consists of differently valued cards in the five colors, money cards valued 1,2 and 3 and cards that raise or lower the values of the point dice.

The first round consists of a number of turns where the active player draws cards equal to number of players + 1. Each card is drawn separately and the player has to decide what to do with the card before drawing the next. The player has to keep one card, put one in the auction pile and place the rest face up on the table for the other players to share. Any dice manipulation cards are played immediately.

Then the other players in order picks one of the face up cards, the deck is passed to the next player who repeats the process until the deck runs out and each player has a hand of cards.

Then the auction takes place, where one card at a time is revealed from the auction pile. Players bid on the cards with the money on hand. If a money card is auctioned, players bid with colored cards with the player bidding the most cards winning. Cards spent this way are discarded face down so the other players can't track what colors now has fewer cards.

At the end of the game, the player with the highest total of points in a color gets that die, and the player with the highest total wins.

There are several things that make this game interesting:

Drawing one card at a time, without knowledge of all the cards you'll draw, adds quite a bit of tension.

Keeping track of who draws what is also important, since that allows you to decide what colors to go for. The totals for each color is known, so you can know whether or not you've collected enough points. But do you really need that last 2 or should you use it to raise your bid for a 3-gold card?

The dice manipulation allows you to lower the value of the color you watch your opponent collecting, reducing a possible gamewinner to nothing more than cards for bidding on money in the auction round.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
First play with 4 and my first impression is maybe there is too many secret and control issues for my taste.

Like an inverse of For Sale, plays in 2 phases: a draft followed by an auction. First issue could be overcome by having an idea of the deck distribution, as I didn't know what my chance was of drawing a good card in the draft, feeling very unlucky to put a single gold in the hand. However this uncertainty in compounded by 7 random cards removed at prep and only 3 of 5 cards drafted are revealed. The former I can cope with, the latter uncertainty increases with less players.

The bidding phase may reveal how much players are interested in a revealed card (drawn from a pile created from the draft) but again only if they are familiar with the deck. You are bidding to get a majority in any of the suits to claim that coloured die with the face up pip count as vps. Yet there are cards that can modify the values either up or down, so here is where I have a control issue especially if you have previously bidded hard for that colour only to have it changed. 

So either I have to play again with less or lighten up, but I felt I was playing a hybrid of High Society and Katzenjammer Blues which I feel both would provide more tension, theme and fairness in the time to play Biblios.

I think this game works better with 3 than 4, but overall there are just so few scoring opportunities that the activity of playing this game easily feels futile. The way it works is you have a deck of cards. The active player takes 1, puts 1 face down for auction, then makes 1 available for each other player to take. Then the next player goes. At the end you auction off the auction pile. After the auction, whoever has the highest in numbers of one of the five colors, get somewhere between 1 and 6 points, depending on the end facing of a die that's been manipulated up and down over the course of the game. It's a cute idea, but the payoff at the end just feels disappointing.

Rather than dealing the cards and have an auction - the players select the cards to go to each pool (personal, other player select for personal, auction pool).
Both phases have an interesting components.

Then there is an auction phase which is also nicely done where you can purchase cards to finish off sets or impact the value of the sets.

The game has a lot of player interaction.

RATING: N/A
Was initially hopeful for this one since it was a more gamery For Sale, which I suppose meant that it was doing For Sale's "First half of the game acquires cards to be used in the second half" thing. Also it supposedly handled 2p, which For Sale couldn't do. In the end, the theme made no sense whatsoever, and the gameplay was incredibly dry. Played a few times, kicked to the curb, and I've never regretted it.

A fun little card drafting game. There's not a ton of meat to it, but it's a great filler or "wait for people to show up" game. There's just enough variance to make me a little iffy on it, but as with most lighter games, that matters a lot less when it's over in 30 minutes.

RATING: 7.5
My wife loves this one after a half dozen plays. We've only played it 2p and it works wonderfully. Between this and Seven Dragons, I think we've learned that we enjoy bluffing. I suspect this will end up a 7 or 8 but I'm putting off reviewing it until we've played it a few more times.

For those looking for travel games, this is a good one. The board, while pretty, is unnecessary. I put the game in a Fantasy Flight deck box with a space for the dice so we can more easily take it with us.

One of the best fillers. I really don't have any complaints about this game. It could end up as a ten at some point.

Update: Obviously I have changed the rating to a 10. I also don't really like calling certain games filler games any more because if it is a good game it shouldn't need to have a specific classification.

For just a deck of cards and a few dice this game manages to include Auction/Card Drafting/Hand Management/Set Collection and Deduction all within a very short time. I don't think there are many others games that pack this big of a punch in such a small package.

Super easy to learn but also allows for gamers to excel.

So all the video reviewers were spot on... this game is light and quite fun.  It is enjoyable with two, but I think it truly shines with 3-4 because you see the additional information for choices the players are making between available cards, where in a two-player game you just give the one other player a card and don't really know what they're going for in the early part.

Beautiful artwork, absent theme. Sounds familiar? But before you know it the game is over and you are asking for a rematch. Great filler, somehow players keep asking for more even if their first impression wasn't a winner. A game that gets deeper as you play it. Better than Love Letter in my books!

A very simple game to teach with a good blend of luck versus strategy. The press your luck with drawing cards one-by-one and assigning them is fun and trying to balance what you collect now and gamble on getting in the auction phase give it just enough strategy but nothing too crazy. Theme is okay, but the simplicity and quick-playing nature of the game are its true strengths. Plays best with three or four players. Excellent filler game that is very easy to get to the table.

This takes one play to get the idea, but am still working out the best tactic for play!
A game of two halves. Distribute cards between self, other players and an auction pile, then auction off that pile to try and get majority in each of the colours. Highest in each gets victory points.
Nice game with a subtle, not immediate, appeal to it.

At first I was left slightly disappointed in the game, but over time I've grown to love it. For the size of the game it's definitely one of my favorite filler games

I've played this quite a bit now and am never dissapointed.  It's easy to teach, players usually "get" it after their first play and are eager to play again, and it provides some fun interesting decisions.  It's surprisingly fulfilling considering how fast and easy to play the game is.

I really enjoy the mix of casual and strategic play. The Gift Phase uses a neat drafting mechanic that sets up a 2nd phase that plays out a bit like For Sale, but I prefer the theme of collecting rare books over selling property. The artwork and components are all top notch too. Overall, this is an excellent filler game that's should appeal to just about any kind of gamer.

RATING: 6
Not a bad filler. After one play, I feel that the scoring is a bit chunky: there are five suits, each one worth the same number of points at the start of the game. This pretty much means that if you don't win in two suits, you don't win. I'd prefer a game like Knizia's Money, where there's more suspense and the chance to win or lose by a slimmer margin.

RATING: 7.8
Simple, easy to learn deduction/memory/bluffing card game that plays quickly(20-30 minutes). The dice in the game look very nice, but unfortunately you don't ever get to roll them since they are just scoring trackers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
You can't really interact at all on your turns in the first part of the game. So it's a bunch of private decisions about how to allot cards. If that's your thing, go for it--I haven't played enough to be sure.

This is a surprise of a game. I had moderately low expectations going in, but was very pleasantly surprised by how fun it is. It's an exercise in valuation, trying constantly to ascribe worth to each card you encounter. Only played with two so far, but it's great. Other than a passing similarity to some facets of For Sale, it's unlike anything else in my collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.17
It's a double auction game (similar mechanic to For Sale).  The players first collect a hand of cards, then they use the hand of cards they collected as currency in the 2nd auction.  There is an element of set collection in this game and you can go for cards of various colors.  You can also manipulate how much each of those colors will be worth in the final scoring.  Good game.

Biblios works well as a 2P game which is a plus compared to For Sale.  However, the art work in For Sale is superior.

Both are great games.

Description: Drafting, auction/bidding, set collection, hand management card game.
Players: 2 to 4, best with 4 or 3.  Light weight.
Designer: Steve Finn.  Publisher: IELLO.

Impression: Cool game that combines drafting in one phase and then auction/bidding for discards in the second phase. It greatly rewords planning and requires careful decision making. It's relatively easy and it could be considered a filler.

Likes: Drafting + Auction combined. Decision making and planning. Quick play. Nice components.

Dislikes: Low replayability.

Has that structure that For Sale and some card games have, of spending the first half building up your hand and spending the second half playing it out. It's clever and slick, but... I don't know... I have this weird feeling that it has kind of free-floating angst without actual concrete decisions underneath to support it... that your ability to gather data on the other player is just a little *too* slim to really ground a lot of the decisions...

Still, a slick design.

Enjoyable set collection card game with paper-thin (ha!) theme. I like the 2 phases: first cards are given out, then the cards not already given to players are auctioned in the second half of the game.

Gets the higher rating and number of plays because I prefer to keep games rotating to make sure friends don't wear out a game on me by playing it too much.

05-12-2014. Rated after 1 play. Fun drafting and auction game. 

The game first has a drafting an an auction part. In the drafting part, you first take 3 cards. Then you keep one, give one to your opponent and give one to a common pile. Afterwards you try to win the auctions for the cards in the pile. 

The players score points equal to the number of pips on the dice on a center board, if they control the most cards of that die color. Cards in the game let you manipulate those pips. Beware of the monks, those are the tie-breaker.

Biblios is a card game where players  play monks collecting different Books and relics for their monastery for points. Players first collect cards and disburse cards to other players getting a little clue about what  will be coming up in the auction phase. Then Players use the gifted cards to bid for cards in the public auction. The twist is  the person with the most cards of a certain type wins the points at which time the point value changes throughout the game. The game plays up to 4 players

Pros: Simple gameplay rules, fun auction mechanism, Fast gameplay, interaction with other players, nice card artwork

Cons: low player count

One play, and it'll definitely be my last!  This is easily the worst game I've played this year - and I was surprised, as it has quite a good reputation.  The initial drafting mechanic seemed ok, and two of us saved cash, while the others collected sets.  But then, in the final draft, there was nothing for the two of us with money to buy, as only one colour came out, and cash - we both ended up with over 8 cash left over at the end of the game.  Then at final scoring, two players had gone deep into the same colour - one got 5 points, and the other nothing - but both had a huge amount in the colour.  In two of the others colours, one player won with just 3, just happening to have most, but as the other bonuses were all really low, it was pretty much irrelevant anyway!

This is a card game where players try to collect influence on five different colors. Two are different from the other three. Whoever holds the most influence at the end gets points equal to the value of the color which is shown as a face value on a die. Two phase collection of cards includes first a selection of where certain cards go and then an auction for the cards put aside during the collection phase. Will play again.

However, it's a bit difficult (especially for new players) to know what sets to shoot for, and it is markedly better at 3p than at 2p (not as fun when the other player just hands you a card) or at 4p (not enough control over your sets).

RATING: 5
Light, easy and fast, but I felt that it was almost over before it begun - the result is almost determined after players' decisions on what to collect. If you happen to focus on cards nobody wants, you're likely to win. If you clash with other players for every card, not so much.

RATING: 6
Quick card filler that keeps players guessing right until the very end. Ultimately there's just not enough control over he game to elevate this to anything more than a light filler with a groan factor. With cards removed from play you can't count, not that you really could effectively anyway because you don't know the primary cards other players have picked up, or what they've discarded in the auction for money. The effect is chaos where a six value suit at the end of the game can win and a nine value can lose - okay, that's okay, but it's not always obvious that'll be the case. Still, I'm perfectly happy to play as the rules are very light and easy to remember and the game keeps you engaged throughout.

Auction game with a pasted on theme. As in For Sale, the game plays in two rounds. In the first one, players set some cards for auction, keep others for themselves and give others to their rivals. Then, the auction is held. The player with the majority in each cathegory score some points, that may change during the game. The player with the most points at the end is the winner.

Pros:
- a nice game for small groups but also a fantastic experience for two players. I even enjoy it more with two, since the game becomes more controllable
- easy to teach
- you are never quite sure about the outcome, so the final reveal is always open for surprises

Cons:
- if you play it a lot over a short period of time it will probably be doomed to some time on the shelf until it gets rediscovered again
- the theme of a monastery and its library is almost to good, compared to what the game does with it (not much)

RATING: 7
Quick and elegant stock-market speculation game. Really like the dynamic where you toss out colors you give up on to bid for gold, so you can get the colors you want. It's fun to deduce which color is being tossed out by everybody, so you can get the cheap die. Definite homebrew quality to the artwork, but the cardstock is nice. The VHS box in which the 3rd edition is distributed is friggin' brilliant, making this the most portable game in my collection.

With 3-4 players, you get to see more cards, and what people pass up, to help with your deduction. With 2 players, bluffing plays a larger role, both with your donation, and in terms of driving up the price of a card you know your opponent wants.

This is the little, versatile game that can do anything. Good for 2, 3 or 4 players, playable in less than 30 minutes, easy to explain and ultra-portable.

Biblios (fka Scripts and Scribes) -- 

Played once; four-player.

We played using an Artscow version of this.  I found myself comparing it to [thing=38032]Byzanz[/thing] for some reason.  While I like Byzanz more, I definitely want to try [thing=34219]Scripts and Scribes[/thing] again.  My brain wasn't up to learning the rules verbally, so for me the session was really more about learning the game.  I expect to enjoy our next session more, now that I have a basic understanding.

From Doctor Finn's web site: "It is no longer in print by Dr. Finn’s Games, but will be published by Iello (hopefully by 2010) under a new name and with new artwork.  Dr. Finn's Games will be the sole U.S. distributor."

[i]Update 2011-03-04:[/i]  Got my shiny new copy of Biblios today.  Beautifully produced.  I really appreciate the color matching between the dice and the Scriptorium board art.  I know it's unnecessary, but such details make me happy.

RATING: 2.5
Good simple game, though I thought I'd like it better. Yes, it's probably one of the best ways to merge auction and set collection (Ra is not an auction game if you ask me, pre-set values does not an auction make). There's some memory aspect, some risk taking. But - no theme whatsoever. What do medieval texts have to do with set collecting? On top of that, even with the double think and speculation the game is not as dynamic and loud as I prefer of the short games. It's more for the sneaky tee hee hee types. Which is good if you appreciate that kind of stuff. I'd prefer more direct interaction. 

As a design it's very good. But somebody should do something about the theming. Yes collecting stamps (or napkins or anything) would make more sense. Anything where one needs majority would also make sense. [-]I don't get comparisons to For Sale - this one is better and more of a game (For Sale seems very fluffy to me). [/-] (oh damn, I wrote this? For Sale is a great accessible little auction game that enable groupthink exploitation.] 

EDIT: if you already have no theme in your game please please please do not make it brown. Dear lord of mediocrity. With the right theme this could be in my top 40 games for sure. But not looking like this. 
EDIT2: Hideosly brown, rating drops. Anybody willing to retheme and recolour this into something decent?

Played a PnP version with stamps instead of books. Biblios' gameplay is pretty simple, although I could never have guessed it from reading the rules alone. There is a strong push-your-luck aspect in both phases of the game. In the first phase, players have to decide which cards they will hold, put up for draft or auction without seeing the complete set. In the second phase, players bid for cards with very little knowledge on what cards are in the auction deck. Players can, however, assess the value of cards in relation to the importance to their collection, so there are some tactics to the seemingly random gameplay. Biblios is an above average filler which is fine for passing 20 minutes or so.

This is so much fun to play!We have only played it with 2 and can't wait to play it with more this coming week.

Unfortunately this is not to everybody's taste. . .

However the simplicity of this game is in complete contradiction to the angst players experience.

 Scripts plays differently with however many players you introduce, but a common feeling through every game is.... AAAAGGHH! I don't want to give you that!!!
You never know the winner until the scoring stage.

Reminds of a pulsating economy fluctuating between spiralling inflation, when there is a lot of gold in hand and players pay over the odds for cards,and near bankruptcy near the end when 2 gold is a fortune!


Highly Addictive

Terrific fun and guarantees a load of laughs.

Great filler game! It's easy to pick up and understand. You go through a phase of drafting cards- each player draws cards off the deck equal to one more than the number of players. They give each player a card (including themselves) and put another in a discard pile. After the deck has been emptied, you then auction off the cards in the discard pile. You can purchase them with gold cards- assuming you kept any gold during the draft phase. Which you did, unless you have no idea what you're doing. Your goal is to collect the most of colored sets which will be equal to a certain number of points. Those point values all start at 3, but can be adjusted throughout the game as some cards are point modifiers.

A drafting/trick taking/bidding game, in a stock market in a package with horrid graphics. Players are drafting cards (take one, put one in pile for bidding in second half of game,
‘ put one for every other player), in order to gain the most influence which in turn determines winning VPs according to the factions stock market value. 

Cards are multiuse and either provide gold for bidding, change the stock market, or give influence towards winning control. A clever twist is that influence cards can also be used to bid for gold cards. Players with the most VPs wins. Unfortunately, the stock market system is inelegant and overly static. The other parts of the games work well but I couldn’t help feel that the game was force fit together.

Very charming auction/set collection game that plays well even with 2. 

Played in 2 parts, the first is where the start player looks at cards up the the no. of players plus one. He then decides on each card if he wants to keep it, place it face down for auction, or leave it face up for other player to take. Certain cards in this phase and the following auction allow the owner to change the value of each colour die up, down or either.

Once the deck is plated through, the auction deck is shuffled and played through one at a time. Normal cards can be bid for using gold card acquired in the first phase. Gold cards have to be bid on using the normal cards.

At the end who ever has the highest value in each colour wins the points equal to the die. Most points wins. 

Really simple and smooth game-play makes this an ideal one to bring out with the family.

Egyszerű, gyors kártyajáték. 5 színt gyűjtünk. Annyi lapot néz meg mindenki, ahány játékos játszik plusz egyet. Egyenként eldönti róluk, hogy magának megtartja, a többieknek elosztásra adja vagy egy játék végi pakliba teszi. A többieknek elosztásra tett lapokat sorrendben választják a játékosok, a játék végi pakli lapjaira pedig majd licitálnak. Az öt színből minél többet kell gyűjteni, akinek a legvégén a legtöbb van, az kapja a játék közben a színhez tartozó kockán állított 1-6 pontot. Pörgős, bárkivel játszható, nincsenek nagy különbségek a végén, izgalmas, bármikor kategória. Játék közben olyan For Sale érzésem volt. Tetszett.

Biblios is a simple, yet fun little card game that doesn't take much to learn, and can be played relatively quickly. It's played in two phases, the 'Gifting' Phase, where you give and take cards, and then the Auction Phase where you purchase cards with money and cards you accumulated in the first phase.

The game is extremely simple. But it just works. It's one of my all time favorite games.

Biblios is way more fun with 3 or 4 people, good for a quick lunch break game with coworkers.  I like the surprise element, since so much is hidden from each player, and yet it it still rewards strategic moves (e.g. in retrospect I can usually pinpoint any mistakes I had made).  If you can't abide surprise losses, you might not like this game, but it's great for more social gamers who don't take losses very seriously but like a lot of interaction with other players and still enjoy some mental challenge.

Played this twice and I'm very positive. Played it both times with 2 non-gamers and they enjoyed the game immensely. 

The setup time is nonexistent, except for the shuffling of the deck. Speaking of the deck, the only negative thing i can say about the game is the cards. I don't know if its the materials used or the thickness, but they are very stiff and that makes a riffleshuffle difficult to do. Also, there are a lot of cards in the game, which makes shuffling even more cumbersome.

Light and small games like this though, have a tendency to become samey after several plays. I'm not sure if this apllies to Biblios but we'll see in the future.


Update af 15 plays: It does get samey after several plays. Lowered my rating from 8 - 7. It's still a very good gateway'ish game with a small foot print and short playing time.

-------UPDATE-------------

Biblios is still a good game, but I don't play it very often. It a great gateway game but after a while the first half of the game (gift phase) is more or less an autopilot thing. I still love auctions though so the game is still going to stay in my collection.

Great game for 3-4 players; not so much for 2 or 5 (latter via Steve Finn's variant). 
Combines elements of Poker, For Sale, and Dominion.  
We've adapted the designer's 5 Player variant (a 2nd set of dice for players coming in 2nd place in each category, along with pre-allocated gold cards) for playing with 3 or 4, and prefer to play that way.  
Unfortunately, even with Finn's variant,  there simply aren't enough cards to go around for 5 players.
And with 2 players, there aren't enough people to spread the risks/rewards of card randomness.

Really fun auction/press-your-luck game.  It reminds me a bit of For Sale, in that you build a hand to spend in the second phase of the game, and you build your hand by choosing cards one at a time and have to elect as to what to throw away.  There's a ton of depth in this slightly-longer-than-a-filler game.  Rating could move up with future plays.

Push-your-luck card drafting in the first half of the game with auctions in the second. Clever and unique, though a bit dry. More than a bit, actually.

It feels a lot like For Sale, but has some interesting twists -- a very clever partially secret card draft system, and the removal of random cards to handicap the card counters ... and I don't even like auctions very much! Should be easy to learn and work great as a filler! 

I LOVE the box (iello version)!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The "board" shows 5 areas matching the card colors; each has a die with the 3-face on top. 

The deck is a mix of money cards (value 1-3); 5 colors (types of books), 2 of which have values 2-4 (each set sums to 25) and the other 3 which have values 1-2 (each set sums to 11); and several action cards (modify the final values of the 5 colors). For setup, remove a number -- based on the number playing -- of cards from the game (some specifically money, some totally random). 

Phase 1-- On your turn, you will draw n+1 cards, one by one. Of these, one will go to each player and one to the auction pile (face down): as you draw each card, must decide whether to take it yourself, put it in the auction pile, or place it face up on display (n-1 will be on display). After you've resolved the n+1 cards, the other players (in clockwise order) add a card from the display to their hand. Then the next player does the same. Repeat till you've distributed all cards in the deck.

Phase 2-- Shuffle the auction pile. On your turn reveal the top auction card. Starting with the next player clockwise, auction it off (round and round; if you pass you're out); bid/pay for money cards using a number of cards from your hand (winner removes these from game), bid/pay for all other cards with money cards. If you win with a  bid more than you can pay, lose a random card from your hand.

NOTE: in both Phases, the action cards (modifying the dice) are resolved as soon as you select the card, then the card is removed from the game.

After all cards auctioned off, for each color the player with the highest sum of cards (ties broken by letter on the cards; earliest in alphabetical order wins) earns the die of that color, worth VP shown on die face. The player with the most VP (tiebreaker = money cards still in hand) wins!

Biblios is light, but there's a surprising amount of tension and depth here... with a feel of "just one more game!" immediately after finishing the first.

My complaint would be that, with new players, the hand building phase of the game takes too long and can seem very tedious.  A learning curve is to be expected, but some players have commented that this one isn't very interesting.  It GETS interesting when one gets how it works, but it doesn't necessarily start that way.

Fast, light filler game. The game is broken up into two parts, the first is a card drafting and the second is bidding on the remaining cards. Biblios has the right amount of randomness and strategy given the length of the game. I wish the colors were more distinctive, I found myself confusing orange and red quite a bit.

This is such a wonderfully designed game, especially at the 3 player mark.

My newbie friend ingeniously beat 2 more experienced players by distributing high numbered cards of the same color evenly between them. Triggering a fight over that colour, allowing her to focus on the other 2-3 other colors.

Let me be absolutely clear about this--we've been playing Scripts and Scribes since its initial VHS box release--and we still play this at almost every other weekly game night...that's what 5 or 6 years, in a game group that is made up of hard-core, card game players, and boardgamers who thrive on playing a different game every week.  It is THAT good.

________________


Updated to a 10.  I honestly think this is quite possibly our most turned-to filler/short game.  It plays FANTASICALLY with 2, 3 or 4 players--not many games can acheive that tricky balance.  Fewer players is a slightly faster game, but at every level the game holds fun and tricky decisions that never sink to AP, because while tricky and hard to commit to, the decisions remain relatively simple, but rarely obvious.

This can be played with brnd new players, and they'll pick it up after a single run-through playing the two stages.  Only thing to watch to clarify is that the Bishop must be played when "chosen," that it can never be held in-hand, even though it can be placed into the auction.

This is a solid addition to the drafting genre of card games.  The less than perfect knowledge of the draft along with the ability to change values in the very streamlined scoring system makes it brilliant.  This may well be waiting to grow into a 10, and it is certainly a filler-length which will always be requested.  

This is the absolute, perfect filler-length 10.
We've now been playing it for a few years, and the desire to play it as a game night closer or a quick game with any number of players, 2,3,4 has not diminished AT ALL.

Well, it turns out the small but rather rabid fan-base that this game has attracted are quite correct - this is truly an excellent little card game!  It's easy to learn, great fun to play, and makes you want to play several times in a row.  What I didn't expect was just how much this game would make me laugh.  For some reason I found some of the outrageous bids and unexpected turns of fortune to be quite hilarious!  The new edition of the game has some vastly improved artwork and pretty cool dice, although I do miss the old VCR case just a little bit!  However, 2-player games aren't as interesting, so the number of players is pretty much limited to 3 or 4.  It's nice that this game is more readily available now as it is one that holds a huge amount of appeal for hardcore gamers and non-gamers alike.  Yes, it turns out I can indeed love a strictly card game.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8/10

RATING: 6
Excellent light auction/set-majority game that mixes things up with a pre-auction drafting phase. Shines with experience. My biggest issue is that, because it's possible for sets to be won even before the auction (e.g. with an absolute majority in a set), the second half -- where most of the interaction is -- can be rather lifeless. Not always, but sometimes.

Really suffers by comparison to For Sale: longer and less consistently engaging.

Edit: and yet, I have bought a replacement for the copy I traded away...

[Doctor Finn's 2007 (VHS) edition] {Arts, religion; auction, card-distributing, card-drafting; optimal 4p} I occasionally search for good games from small publishers.  Many people recommend Scripts and Scribes. So, I give it a try

Scripts & Scribes doesn't fail me.  It is really a nice game.  It is easy to teach and learn.  It is interactive and fun.  A typical game runs around 25-30 minutes.  It provides both strategy and tactical elements.  Due to the hidden information in donation phase, a player can create different intrigues to get points, waste other players' resources, etc.  The luck element is not as high as common card games.  Wise play really pays off.  In all, I enjoy playing this game!

The components are effective.  However, it is not that easy to distinguish different types of card in dim environment because the color tune is too dark.  The artwork doesn't interest me.  The cardstock is thick enough for many plays.

RATING: 7
Biblios is a clever game divided into two parts. In the first half you have to dole out cards to each player and one to the auction stack (for later). You can't look at them all first so there is a little bit of press-your-luck. Should I keep this first card which is pretty good, or should I risk it and hope that the next card is even better? I don't think I'm a big enough risk-taker to do well at this game. I always cave during the auction phase (part 2). I end up saving my cash for something really good, but that really good card never shows up. My terrible auction aptitude doesn't keep me from enjoying the game though.

A great, quick little cardgame. A winner-take all set collecting game where cards are acquired firstly through a kind of Merchant of Amsterdam-style draft, and subsequently through auction. VP of each set gets adjusted by special cards. You seem to know a little about each player's situation, and have to guess the rest. I've enjoyed it with 2, 3 & 4 players.

Okay game. My biggest problem with it is the lack of build up and almost "auto-pilot" feeling the game has. Where there isn't enough known information to properly calculate who has what and how valuable something is. The scores are also super low and the game ultimately is very anti-climactic as you can lose by a single card when tieing with someone due to number value and losing to letter value. Not a bad game by any means, but I'd prefer to play "For Sale" for a two-phase bidding / buying game or just "Ra" for a pure bidding game.

RATING: 6
Light card game centred around collecting "books" as you attempt to compile a library. The cards come in five different categories and each turn the player has to decide between three choices 1). to keep a card 2). to give it to an opponent 3). to put it aside for a later auction. Victory points are awarded to the person who owns the greatest value of each card at the end of the game and the amount of points a category is worth can alter throughout the game through the playing of 'Church' cards. There's a small amount of strategy on offer here and some indirect conflict as you attempt to give opponents cards they don't want and reduce the victory points in the categories they're likely to win. Overall the game is a bit too thin, although it does play quickly and has an element of tension when the victory points are being calculated as it is often difficult to know who has won until right at the end.

Game of set collection. Has some evaluation of worth in it but not much tension. Doesn't require too much brainpower and has easy rules, so for me it's a gateway game towards something I'd rather play. Bit long for a filler.

Problem being, there are so many better gateway games (Ticket to Ride, Small World, Take That) or filler games (Innovation, San Juan) that I'll always find something else I prefer over this one.  Bit bland. Pass.

Books, manuscripts, pigments and workers are used as resources to ultimately create the greatest library (win victory points for amassing these assets). A unique set collection game where the values of the sets can be manipulated with the power of Church Cards. Also, cards are collected in 2 ways - A gift phase where you decide to keep, give away or send to auction cards and the auction in which you bid on cards. Works great for 2 players.

An unusual imperfect information card draft, followed by an auction for the 'rejected' cards.

Update: Played again and is much better now we're playing it correctly and I know what I'm doing! :) Surprising how much the imperfect information comes into effect, even with only 2 players. It is a pretty subtle game and takes a few plays to really wrap your head around how to play well.

The 2-person bidding mechanism is clever!--like 'Medici V. Strozzi' it allows for a some very tempting inferences to be made about your opponent's goals. Not unlike some of the classic Knizias, you are essentially competing to build discrete sets.  But this game feels lighter, which for many is not nec. a bad thing.  The strategy involved in 'Biblios' is not as multi-layered as in 'Battle Line' or LC perhaps as the suits are not ordered or assembled into tricks etc., but the extra psychological dimension of the game may make up for it.

RATING: 6
I'm surprised at my opinion of this game. It should be one I like, and I sort of do. But then again, it seems too repetitive and tactical for it's own good -- maybe too fiddly, but I have a difficult time using that word for a game that is only a deck of cards and some dice. The truth is, it just didn't grab me. For a similar experience, but one I find more fun (if slightly less skillful), try For Sale.

Biblios is a great filler game that can be played in a tight time frame, and yet it still has elements of drafting cards, pushing your luck, memory, and auctioning.  There are two distinct phases to the game, sort of like in For Sale.  The game is book-themed, and as an added plus, the game box looks like a book!

I was a bit disappointed in Biblios. I love the card-drafting mechanic (although luck plays a huge part ... I saw only one "3" money card in my first game) and the auctions are fine. My disappointment comes with the very limited opportunities to change the values of the categories, and the fact that the game almost seems over in terms of what you can influence before the auction phase even starts. There are only eight cards that change the category values, and in our three-player game, two were randomly not in the game. Two or three more came out in the drafting phase so early that nobody really had any idea what values they wanted to raise or lower (not really having a stake in any of the categories yet). The last card or two came out very early in the auction, so for the last half of the game - almost the entire auction phase - there was no way to adjust the values of the categories. By then, I knew I was going to win a "3" and a ""4" value category for 7 points. All the other categories were locked in a "4" value, so in a three-player game someone was guaranteed to win at least two categories for 8 points. Which is a long-winded way of explaining that for half the game, I was just playing out the string with no way to change anything that mattered (of course, I didn't know this for sure, and found out only after the game that two of the eight value-adjustor cards were out). OK, it's a card game and that will have some hands that are skewed from time to time. I understand that. But I really didn't feel I could influence much once the drafting was done, and being lucky enough to see the high-value cards on your turn in the draft is really what the game boils down to, rather than the anti-climactic auction. Biblios is light and I'd certainly try it again, but it felt to me like a Knizia filler on par with Quandry but without the balance and surprisingly deep player options Knizia seems to infuse into his filler games.

Played once with 4 players. There is a lot of luck in the draw in this game, especially with more players. One player consistently drew the high valued cards first on his turn and never was forced to take a Bishop card. During the second phase, he won one or two auctions only and easily won the game, claiming three of the 5 categories. Definitely need to play a bit more, especially with 2 players to see how it plays in multiple situations.

:thumbsup: A drafting/bluffing/auction game that works great with 2.
:thumbsup: Creates some mind games between you and your opponent.
[b][color=green]------------------------------[/color][/b]
:?block: There is a memory component, but we found it to be insignificant. It's more about knowing the general direction your opponent is going in, and not every single card you know they ever had. The reason is that players often strategically discard some of their cards in the auction phase, face down, and it greatly diminishes the benefit of trying to remember every card you gave them in the drafting phase. Rather, you're trying to read your opponent based on their betting and category value manipulation.
[b][color=red]------------------------------[/color][/b]
:thumbsdown: The ratio of what's happening on the table and in your head is heavily skewed towards the latter. There's no immediate resolution, and it can feel like the whole game is one gigantic turn setting up the final scoring. This somehow makes the game feel heavier than it is.
:thumbsdown: There's not much theme here. For one, we never call categories Monks/Pigments/Holy Books/etc., but rather just brown/blue/green/etc. They are just different categories for set collection, and they don't behave in any remarkable way that would give them any distinction or character.

Easy to pick up, nifty auction mechanism. 2-player can be unforgiving because of its cut-throat, win-or-lose nature. I find that 3- and 4-player games are more random because you have to keep tabs on all players to have an edge.

RATING: 8.5
A brilliant short card game that somehow manages to cram push-your-luck, bluffing, and mid-level strategy into a very good 30 minutes.  The tension ramps up towards the end at a perfect pitch, betraying the stuffy medieval trappings and veering graciously towards the guardrails, all the while threatening to send all passengers over the cliff.  Has more in common with For Sale than Race for the Hype, er Galaxy, San Juan, or Glory to Rome.  Highest recommendations.

Plays fast, great with two players, and is a lot of fun. Just divvy out the cards in the first phase, bid on cards in the second phase, then figure out who has the most of each color for scoring. Awesome filler.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3+[/b]
With two players it can be too easy to see who's got the majority of colors, so the element of luck is increased as to who gets the church cards. With more players things are more spread out and you never know who has the majority.

It is currently one of my most played games.  Good tension and little downtime.

Compact and has a very small footprint, so it travels well.

Scales well from 2-4.

Great for gamers and non-gamers.  It can be taught and played in a short amount of time.

I really do not like the artwork or theme. Though I like original themes, I just don't like this one.  I think a theme that had more to do with set collection would rest more easily with the mechanics of this one and therefore be more evocotive.

The reprint will likely appeal to me more, so when I where out this version I'll be happy to buy the new one.

Like For Sale, Coloretto, No Thanks and a few others I think this one belongs in every collection.  Easy to teach and fun for all. 



Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 5
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 4.5

An essential addition to every game library,  this entry offers some truly unique game play with a high replay value.

The game itself,  has two distinct phases that compliment each other in perfect unison.  The first phase is a refreshingly unique mechanic, and to me,  is the highlight of the game.  It is rife with harrowing choices and unlike anything I have ever experienced before.

As far as the ideal player count is concerned,  it's a much trickier proposition than it appears.  This is mostly due to the fact that there are so few victory points available in the game - and this creates the only flaw,  in an otherwise perfect design.  The thing is,  the mechanics of the game are at their stellar best when this is played multi-player.  However,  with so few points to go around,  all players need to be on board,  as any sub-optimal play can skew things in a detrimental way - and that is a lot to ask of every player,  every turn,  in a game of this weight.

A great light auction/sharing game, with a working theme.

I like both the theme intergration and the scoring system in biblios, but what really elevates this for me is the decision making process. It really makes for some hard choices everytime.

On the other hand there is some luck in the game, luck of the draw on the first phase actually but it's not that much of a problem. There is also some downtime in the game, but since the game plays fast that's not much of problem either.

In the end, it's a really good filler/family game.

Game plays superbly as a 2 player as well as 3 or 4 even. Gotta love a game that feels the same with any number of players.

Fantastic! I'm really impressed by this card game. I've played it four times now and am eager to get a copy when it's finally reprinted. I named it my favorite card game of 2008, but it's more than that, it was a real contender for my favorite game period of 2008. This game looks unassuming and ordinary. It wasn't on my radar whatsoever until a friend got a copy and suggested playing. It's now one of my favorite card games ever. I've always liked, but not loved, card games like Lost Cities, Odin's Ravens, and Balloon Cup. They're a good idea, but not quite satisfying. The idea of a unique and novel card game with staying power to play in 20 minutes with your significant other has proven elusive. I've ended up turning to small board games in order to get enough decision-making to be satisfying in that time frame, such as Aton, Hey That's My Fish, and Fjords, but Scripts & Scribes is a card game with decision-making and tension galore. I won't go into great detail, but essentially you're trying to get the majority of cards in various colors, and each turn you draw three cards, allocating one to yourself, one to your opponent, and one to a common pool that will be auctioned off at the end of the game. You draw the three cards one at a time, making the decision of where to allocate before seeing the rest of the three, which makes it a tense and agonizing decision. I highly recommend this card game for anyone who has enjoyed the Kosmos line, but hasn't found them to pack quite enough of a punch.

This is a GREAT card game. It is simple and at the same time has some very innovative game mechanics. It runs in 30 to 40 min with 4 (or 5 players, yes it is playable with also 5 players). If you like card games with bidding, then go to the designer's website and BUY this one. It worths every penny! The art is "medieval". I do not like this kind of art. But it works in this game. Also the cards are of very good quality.

A pleasant surprise. Highly recommended!!!

The new edition of the game with the new art does not leave any reservation to buy this game!

RATING: 6.5
I played Biblios Dice before Biblios, despite the former predating the latter by several years, so my impression of this was shaped by my experience with the dice version. They're very similar games with just a few important differences.

You're still competing to have a majority in a color to claim the points for a particular die, which is variable depending on how many pips are shown on the die. And you're still collecting money to compete in auctions. What I liked about this version over the dice version was that it seemed much quicker. What I didn't like was that the competition for control of a color was all or nothing, so you lost a lot of the nuances of Biblios Dice where you might be contented taking second place in several contests. I also found the auction mechanism in the dice version more interesting.

Overall, Biblios is very quick... but even so, I didn't find the game compelling for the amount of time you invest in it. Someone compared it to For Sale... I'd much rather play FS than this.

The game works pretty smoothly. In first phase, players get cards: in every turn, you choose one card for yourself, one for auction (the second phase) and which to give to the other players. The thing is that you [b]only look one at a time[/b]. So you have to estimate and sometimes hope for the best. It is pretty fun to see someone take for himself the first card, only to "oh, no" once the second, third or fourth come along. Bishop cards (the ones that change the value of the dice) must be used immediately.

The firs phase ends when the deck ends. Then starts the second phase - the auction phase. All the cards put for auction in the first phase will the sold. For resources cards the players pay with gold, for gold cards, the players pay with cards.

Once the second phase ends, players count the number of resources they have for each type, and the one with the most, take the resource die linked to that resource, scoring the amount of points shown in the dice. The winner is the player with the most points.

[thing=34219][/thing] is a really fun filler. It has interaction and decisions throughout the whole play. Sure, luck plays a big part, but the game is short enough for this doesn't bother too much, and usually smart play is more important.

The quality of the components is good, though nothing major.

Very fun game. Simple once you get the hang of it but still has a good level of decision making. Moving past the theme quickly while teaching it helps a lot since some people will find the theme boring. Strategies change with the player count. Pace quickens with experience and turns into a game people want to play multiple times. Good price point. Very solid game

I am not a big fan of the theme, but everyone seems to love this game.  It is always easy to throw it out there at 12:30am and get a quick game in before calling it a night.  Never too late or tired for Biblios.  

I would actually rate this game a 9 or 10, if it were not for the quality of the cards.  They do not shuffle well, because they stick together. The card edges get dinged up fast exposing the white under the black.  Thus you can, if you are observant, realize what some cards are because of marks left. But this won't last long since many will be like this after about 5+ plays.  The cards are also glossy with a laminate sheen, so if you are germ-a-phobic the fingerprints and oil from peoples hands is very visible.  

Don't let all of this deter you however, this is a GREAT game, and all gamers should own it.  In the end I hope more simple fun drafting/bidding games like this one come around, and preferably with a cooler theme.

4 plays in (3 correct) and we are enjoying it a lot.  2 player plays only.  seems like the drafting phase in the beginning should be boring, but it was interesting (once we had failed a few times at doing it right) - the removal of cards from the game; suits with different value distributions; that annoying other player; taking into account the draft phase (can i get that card back?).  then a fun, frustrating draft and you are done.  it shouldn't be as fun and interesting as it is, but it all adds up nicely.  

but zero theme.  and the new cards could be designed a ton better (leaving aside the fact that they don't shuffle well, and the edges tear immediately), it is VERY hard to tell suits apart at a glance.  i am pretty sure i would prefer the original art/design better.  this one is polished but not useful.

This is the best card game of 2008, and my all-round favourite self-published (not [i]my[/i]self) game.  It's a brilliant auction/bluffing game in a small package, with one of the most singular card-drafting mechanisms I've ever seen.  

Strongly recommended.

There is a palpable sense of tension and a fair amount of second guessing during gameplay. I am constantly wondering the right balance of taking gold cards or score cards. While there is some luck in card draw, choosing which cards to keep and which cards to go public is crucial and likely requires repeated plays to get a better feel. The auction part is quite standard, but the dual currency during auction requires a delicate balancing act. Not enough cash and you can't buy more cards, but it is tough to let go of cards to get more cash. Tough, tough decisions.
The only gripe I have is the final scoring. There aren't many ways to score and also many ways to modulate the final score. This makes it tough to change strategy mid-way...something I like to do in games.

Amazingly simple elegant game- 5 dice (that you never roll) and a deck of cards.  Brilliant little auction mechanic.  You 'gift' cards to yourself, opponents and set aside cards to auction.  You bid with gold that was gifted.  Perfect game to play with the wife before bedtime.  Minimal pieces but yet deep decisions.

very easy to learn and quick gameplay. First there is like a "market phase" where everyone can pick cards and accumulate a stack of cards. In the second phase there is an auction for every card. You try to collect the most points in certain colors which are "rated" with dice. The higher dice value shown, the more points the color is worth. That results in a competition for the most wanted colors, except someone alters those dice with special cards which can be very valuable and make the game very very more interesting.
Overall I enjoyed it pretty much to play this game. Played it with 4 players.

Definitely in the same category as "For Sale", with a couple of extra gears to turn.  Very solid game.

Weird note- the iello version LOOKS nice out of the box, but the cards are too thick to shuffle, the gloss shows wear and dents A LOT and quickly, the dice are an inefficient method of tracking values over score tracks with chits, and the color matching between the cards, dice, and boards is poor.

The first half of the game time is spent "dealing" out the cards in an unusual manner.  It is indeed distictive, but mostly I find it tedious (for [b]half[/b] the game?).  It is still very little more than randomness although it seems intended to project a feeling of control.  I view  that as false and  misleading.

The second half of the game is a tug-of-war and possibly mis-direction to change the value of various suits while sumultaneously acquiring strength in a desired suit. There is a conflict between holding cards you want versus the need to spend some.  I am not harmed in playing it but neither am I truly drawn in to any of the suposed tension.

Exciting for someone else, apparantly, but dull for me.

A really fine card game that uses familiar mechanisms in a really interesting combination.  You Draft your hand, while creating an auction deck and giving your opponents a card.  Once done you go through the auction deck created.  Bishop cards allow you to manipulate the victory point value of the categories.  The rules are easy to grasp, game play is fun, and replay value is very high.  Great game!

Very good little game with a lot going on. Initial impression was very positive, if a little obtuse to understand at first. It makes a lot of sense once it gets going. 

Mechanically, it sounds like it would be sort of cobbled together of random other parts, but the core mechanic of assigning cards to various areas ties it all together very interestingly. 

It seems like a game of wagering and intuition, which is something that not a lot of games beyond the occasional social party game tend to include much of.  Glad to see this skillset showing up in a game witha  little more meat, while still staying in the

VERY cool.  It's a little more than your typical filler game, and it's a neat mesh of Money! and For Sale.  The first half of the game is setting up your hand, other players' hands, and the auction pile; the second half of the game is bidding on the cards in the auction pile with cards out of your hand.  This is a nifty little game with a couple of different strategies for accumulating hand cards, and that you determine points off of a separate, relative board is what elevates this to another level.  I can see this becoming my next new filler game.

You are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.
\13\\13\
The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or less Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.

UPDATE:  A bit of a different feel as a 2P game.  We played two games and for both games we had one category that didn't end up getting scored.  I think I prefer this one 3P or 4P as it seems there's a bit more control and strategy.

Here's a BGG rarity, a game that actually lives up to the hype. It has a very unique drafting mechanism tied to an equally unique set collection mechanism. The cards you are trying to collect are a bit of a moving target, because the other players are not only competing for the same sets, but also directly controlling the value of each set for the end game scoring. It ends up being a very cool interlocking puzzle with multiple approaches to winning. Do I focus on driving the value down on a color I am weak in? Do I let my opponent control the market values and hope his decisions telegraph his intentions, so that I can counter them? The depth of the game is impressive, considering I can teach someone to play in literally five minutes.

Got pretty hyped about this one, and that tends to lead to let down when it arrives.  I won both introductory games vs my woman and started getting that "another game I'll never win" look.  The initial donation phase seemed slightly...dull is strong, but close to the mark.  I think that will get more exciting as we understand the importance of each card.  To maximize the number of cards she had, my opponent avoided bishops.  That gave me full manipulation of the Victory Points.  Initial out-of-the-box rating: 7ish...I'll go with 7.1 as I expect it to move up a bit as we get more familiar.

This is a fairly fast game and it is a lot of fun to play. There are two phases to the game. In the first players take turn selecting cards to keep, offer to the other players or place into the auction for later. In the second phase the cards from the auction pile are auctioned off, and in the end whoever has collected the most cards of each color gets that die, and the score is based on the pips on each die. I honestly have not been able to figure out a good strategy to win but I enjoy trying. 1-11-16

Definitely a surprise hit/hidden gem. 

I've had this on my Wishlist for years. Probably since 2010ish when a reprint/retheme triggered some buzz at BGG.con. While it was on my list to track down and play, it was never high enough to be a priority. 

Perhaps based entirely on my low expectations, I found this surprisingly enjoyable. The "gift" phase was a fun exercise in "push your luck" as you tried to determine what to keep, what to auction, and what to give up. The second phase of the game is a nice auction that seemed to work relatively well even with 2P. 

While the theme was clearly pasted on, the artwork was fine and the game flew by. Our 2P game seemed to be under 25m including a code rules reading/explanation. This feels very similar to something like Sushi Go - while it's not itself an amazing/groundbreaking game, it fulfills it's role of a light filler game exceptionally well. There are some similarities between this and For Sale. 

My rating may go up or down with additional plays. For what it does:

Interesting 2 stage game. The 1st stage is to build your hand. You draw 3 cards (1 at a time) and assign to 3 areas (your hand, the auction pile, common area). Each other player takes a card from the common pile. After you have gone through the deck. The auction of the auction pile takes place. You bid gold for color cards and cards for gold cards. Very interesting game.

Excellent filler card game! Clever mechanics. Plays very smoothly, with interesting decisions but avoids being a brain-burner. Very portable so you can easily carry it around if you want. This has taken "Mystery Rummy's" place as the always-willing-to-play card game for my wife and I.

I find this game best with two. With two it is possible to work out close approximations of what your opponent has, so the bluffing and bidding become extremely tense.

The artwork is pretty ugly, and I'm not sure why the card value distributions for the workers vs. the resources are different, but the game itself is a lot of fun! An excellent self-published game.

A quick auction game that plays in two phases. Has a "press your luck" element to it when deciding which cards to put where in the first phase. Then it becomes a pure bidding game in the second phase. Plays relatively quickly, though it is a bit longer than something like For Sale.  The one thing I found somewhat confusing is trying to figure out why not all colors of cards had the same card distribution ... seeing so many 1's and 2's of some of the colors really threw me off, so I'd be sure to mention this quirk while giving a rules explanation.

Most aspects of the game are minimalist and rather unoriginal, but drafting and auctions are two of my favorite mechanics, so the game's two-round draft-then-auction structure appeals to me a lot.

Nice little game. It's fun, but lacks just 1 or 2 extra things to make it really memorable. 

But it has a nice balance of randomness and strategy. Fun to play.

Good collecting cards filler with a touch of trading that involves a monastery, if you add an amazing package and really beautiful artwork you have it. Once you play it, you´ll want a copy in your collection.

I've played this game a hand full of times now... and I really enjoy it. It wasn't actually a game that I thought about for my collection but decided that I should add some smaller/quicker games that to round out my collection and that this might be good as a family/lunch/filler type of game. There's a surprising amount of strategy and depth, and I've found that most games end with every tight results. Very happy that I picked it up.

RATING: 7.5
As far as set collection games go, this one is fast, feels different, and still manages to squeeze in strategy. There are two halves to the game. The first half is sort of a drafting, 1 for you, 1 for the auction, and 1 for each opponent. The second half is the auction. You're trying to collect the most points in different tome types and can alter how much they are worth at end game.

This is an absolutely excellent filler game. Probably the best filler game that I've ever played right next to splendor. My wife loves this game because of it simplicity and creative card play. I would never turn down a game of Biblios!  It is excellent!  I love the push your luck aspect of the game when you have to draw the three cards in a two player game and decide what to do as you draw them one by one. I also love how you never know for sure what your opponent has in their hand but you have a decent idea because you've been giving them a fair amount of cards yourself. It's always exciting and intense when you finally show what cards you have at the end of the game determine who wins the dice for points and ultimately who wins the game.

This game uses a clever assign / auction mechanic that adds a unique twist to set collection.  I was concerned at first that the auction would not be exciting with only two people; however, this was not the case.  The limited resources along with the angst of the unknown add tension to the auction that makes each one meaningful.  Assigning cards to the three different piles and the ability to manipulate the VPs via the Bishops (Cookie Jar) allows for some subtle bluffing techniques.  This is a great little game that plays fast.  My wife and I played two games with rules explanation in less than 45 minutes. 
 
The current availability of the game is a deterrent.  It is currently out of print and copies are being offered at a high value.  There is a reprint in the works that should be available soon.  That should make this great game more affordable and more accessible.

Raised my rating to a ten. This is the most-played game in our collection. It's simply a masterpiece. Every single decision from start to finish is excruciatingly important.

Biblios proved itself a very solid game. It looks good, is very easy to teach and learn, and plays at a good clip. The game has you cringing at tough decisions and bad luck, while hooting, and laughing when things work out your way.

Yet, it's mostly a bit one sided. As if the rest of the table isn't in on the joke, or why you have such a hard time deciding what to do. Contrast this with a game like The Boss, where every decision, and bluff is more overt, and Biblios feels more like back-room wheeling and dealing.

I'm not sure yet where my rating will end up, but my friends really enjoyed it, which is a plus.

I made a home made version with a Date Night Theme for our 5th anniversary.

The different values for the different commodity sets made for some interesting choices and the whole donation round was pretty engaging.  Our second game showed how each decision in the auction round can effect multiple parts of the game.  This can be tense and fun, I'm looking foward to playing more!

A very fun filler game. You draw cards, one at a time and choose what to do with that card. Keep, put it up for auction or give it to the other players. You can only keep one card per round, and only put one up for auction. The rest you give to the other players. Super simple but fun

I had higher hopes for this. I just think I don't find auction games terribly interesting or enjoyable. With 2 players it just seems there isn't enough competition to adjust/win the dice and the result is often a foregone conclusion. I'm debating whether it needs to stay in my collection but for the time being I think it's worth keeping around for something a bit different.

While I quite like this simple little set collector, I was initially really disappointed.  That game description makes this sound cool as hell and steeped in theme.

This game is slowly growing on me. I initially bought it for the theme and the artwork (hey it looked cool). After several plays however I felt it was far too luck driven.

I have since upped my rating and have decided to mark this one: Final Verdict Pending.

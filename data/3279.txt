Seems too simple for my taste.  The cards are generally not interesting- and that's a big problem for a card game.

RATING: 7
Picked up used decks that were left over on the prize table near the end of BGG.con 2006.

I've only played a few matches between the pre-constructed decks from the original set, Arderial (air) and Orothe (water).  A few comments:

- Every card, even common ones, would be broken in any other CCG, but they are balanced in Magi-Nation.  It's like a showdown between rares that can work together well (not always the case for rares in other CCGs).

- "Mana" flow has a feeling of "law of conservation", and while it restricts how much you can spend/do per turn (it's a semi-finite resource of your Magi, which is passed on as a semi-finite resource to your creatures, with relatively small incoming energy per turn), due to the wildness of the cards, you can still do a lot with just a little.  Plus it's just fun to move little glass droplets around, which one typically doesn't get to do enough of in other CCGs, though the default paper tokens are less fun.

- Each magi is what I sometimes wish the legends in MtG were: someone who stands back from the battle and directs things (in Magi-Nation by spending their own energy on spells and creatures).  And of course you get three of them, each with their own special effect.

- Creatures get hurt when they attack other creatures, which means that even chump blockers can have more of an effect than just buying time for your magi.  On the other hand, as your opponent chooses your blockers, you need to offer up some difficult choices for them.... 

- Creatures don't get hurt when they attack magi, which also has a sense of balance, since normally any magi will obliterate any creature if they could hit back, and it makes creatures a better threat with a clear board on your opponent's side.

- Because you need to knock out three magi, the game has a few resets in them and both players get a few second chances.  This can also drag out the game, which is what happened on most of the matches.

- One can get used to the art, which is more cute than realistic.  Somehow it's fitting for this particular CCG.

All in all, it's a fun little CCG, and I think one could have fun just by having each of the pre-constructed decks (5 in unlimited, and 2 in a couple of the expansions).  Total cost would appear to be at most $4 per deck, as this is a dead CCG with a small pool of buyers.

Many of the cards are "Holy Cow!" cards that would be broken in any other CCG... in this one they're just commonplace.  Simple, fast, but has some strategy at least.

This is my favorite CCG of all time. OK, it's actually one of my favorites, period. The three-magi-per-player rule cancels the "snowball" effect that is so common in CCG's (once you start to lose, it gets chronically harder to come back), and the concept of energy moving around on all the cards is a real nice mechanic. It's a shame that most people will never learn the incredibly deep, yet simple gameplay that can be reached with a few thousand cards.

Really fun and enjoyable game with easy setup and easy play. Infact just pick 3 mages and get a bunch of boosters and you still have a playable deck...actually that's exactly what the starters are, three mages from a chosen region and the rest are pseudorandom but most being from the chosen region

I've always considered this the game that Magic: The Gathering should have been. Too bad its run was cut short by bad business decisions.

RATING: 6
This is EASILY one of the best CCGs ever made.  But, I still find problems with the idea of CCGs. Magi-Nation went too far, too fast, and as I understand it, it's not doing too well anymore, and may soon be a thing of the past.  What's scary is Magi-Nation is great by doing something someone should have a long time ago: take Magic:TG and modify it to make a better game.  No more power gaming and "I'll cast 15 of this card to kill you now!" crap. Since everything is powered by, in essence, your lifeforce and your monster lifeforce, you can't simply cast away without there being serious consequences.  A simple mechanic that makes fantastic changes, and a CCG well worth trying out.  I just wish I understoof why it's not doing so well; most serious gaming shops I've been don't carry it anymore, and the official website is seriously scaled down from what it used to be.  I guess investing in that awful Game Boy game might have dented the card game a bit.

RATING: 6
Call this one, Magic Lite.  Beautiful artowrk and simplified play make this a great game for kids, but serious CCG players may find it a bit boring.  My 7 year old loves it.  Typical of most CCGs, it suffered from the "too much, too soon" syndrome, making it almost impossible to collect a set unless you have the resources of Donald Trump.

I was so hyped about this when it first came out. Great CCG where every card is fun and the mana/energy mechanic works very well. Unfortunately they tried to build a giant franchise empire too quickly, and the game just didn't catch on like they expected. I was never a fan of the cutesy anime artwork either. Did manage to buy a whole box of boosters for like 10 bucks years ago on cardhaus.com. Not a perfect CCG by any means but still a lot of fun.

Fun little CCG with some real balance issues.  Its a dead game, so it shouldn't be hard to get all the cards for cheap.  Some might be turned off by the kiddie artwork.

I still have hundreds of these cards, with 8 or 9 fully playable decks built, but can't convince anyone to play it with me.

RATING: 6
Has the best system to generate energy (or mana or Force or spells or whatever the game uses as currency to play cards) ever.  You can't get hosed.  You make energy at a constant rate.  Very nice.

Base set - All the cards seem to do the same thing.  Much less variety than in other CCGs.  I could easily build two competitive decks that require very different playstyles, but nothing like the variety in Magic or even the Harry Potter CCG.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I have a lot of respect for this game.  The mechanics were something new, and not another tired MTG rip-off.  The art could be hit-or-miss, but overall it was fun.  Despite some clever promotion schemes, Magi-Nation never really seemed to establish the following it needed to carry on.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Solid CCG.  Simple rules and really no timing issues.  A friend and I got into this CCG cheap and had a lot of great sessions putting decks together and playing.  One negative about the game is that it is not draft friendly at all.  Another negative about the game is that sometimes our matches would end up being long epic wars of attrition as sometimes it can take quite a while to take out 3 of your opponents magi. (maybe we weren't agressive enough).

This is a fantastic CCG & one of my favorites!  I believe this game is BETTER than MAGIC: THE GATHERING (yes, I said it) & didn't get the treatment & support it deserved.  Great Mechanics, Great Cards, Great re-playablity, Great card designs, Great artwork!  What more can I say other than, it never should have gone away.  Love it.

If you produced this game with high-fantsy styled artwork and marketed it as more of an adult game, it would be one of the best.
Way, way better than given credit for.  No resource problems...no bad draws with the starting cards given...alot of strategies and varied results. Really, really strong ccg!

The gameplay is very fun, varried, strategic and easy to grasp.  The artwork as is, is anime, (childish...?)and isn't bad by any stretch.  The game gets lumped in with the other "kiddie" CCGs unfairly because of this artwork.
Much, much better than Poke, Yugi, YuYu, etc.

I got this game way after it had its run, because it was so cheap and a buddy of mine had some.  It's actually really fun to play, and the pictures on the cards are adorable (Japaneese, go figure).  I like the power tokens and the faction themes.  The only thing that sucks is how unavailable they are with the acception of the base set and the last set.  There are tons of expansions that I cannot find for any price, which makes it not get played a whole lot.  Anyone who plays ccgs knows that you almost have to have a constant pulse of new cards to keep it fun to play.

I liked it, I really did.  The art was cool.  However...balance issues.  Big, big balance issues.  Oh, plus the local "promotor" was a douche.

In my opinion, the best CCG ever created.  However, I do not enjoy the money well that is any CCG, so I left this community along with all other CCGs.  

I would be very excited to see this come back out in a LCG-type format.

One of my personal favorites.  I'm sad this game did not last longer.  I am not, however, blinded to the fact that the game structure has several imperfections and the overall balance is skewed towards certain archetypes.  Nevertheless, I truly enjoy the artwork, gameplay, card design, and overall feel of the game!

What appears to be a simple card game actually has a lot of decision making and difficult choices (both in deck construction and actual play). I always feel that I could be playing at a much higher level but just not able to make the best decisions. The art and the game lore are also big pluses for me here.

A very well constructed CCG that seems fairly easily grasped by a child old enough to read by themselves. The artwork - while cartoonish - is consistent and the gameplay moves along briskly. I particularly like the way that the "energy" of the game is used for both powering spells and a given creature's life force, as well as how combat works.

Cute, quick and rather fun variant on the 'battling wizards' CCG.  Since you have three characters who each start at full strength when one is eliminated, the game tends to go back and forth a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
CCG made during the glut of the 1990s. A cross between MtG and Pokemon, which worked it's way from five 'colours' in the base set to 14 in the fourth expansion.
My only complaint was the game allowed for a first turn kill as there were a few combinations of starting cards that could do it. Sure, you have to kill your opponent's magi three times, but that lead to a serious advantage.
That said, it was a great game and I'd never turn down a match if challenged. However, if I see a certain Magi, Relic, and Spell taken as starting cards, expect a swift kick in the nuts.

RATING: 9
Great game with even greater artwork. One of the great aspects of the game was the built in energy (manna) feature. Each turn the magi would energize on top of a set starting energy level. No need for resource cards. One of the other great features was the fact that a quick kill of a magi didn't put you out of the game. Lose a Magi? Go to the second. This added a great amount of strategy as well as uncertainty to each game. Excellent game. I highly recommend it.

The rules system this game is based upon is perfect. There's some balance issues in the actual cards, but if another company bought the rules from them and reskinned this (cough fantasy flight cough) into an LCG, I think I might sell every other game I own.  So much fun, if this TCG had more exposure, it would have been among the greats.

A quite decent CCG. It was introduced to me when it came out as a Magic-killer, but it never caught on.

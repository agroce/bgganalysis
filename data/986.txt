This is an excellent two player game. Really imaginitive and individual. It has a brilliant balance between managing your own hand and watching and messing with you opponent. The cards have very different powers but none are over or under powered. Confrontational which we like.

Vicious two-player game. Took a few games to get a good feel of the mechanics. Very odd implementation of the theme. Exactly what is it supposed that you are doing in this game? Despite it's peculiarities, it's a great game.

100212 Fun medium light game...but somewhat unforgiving of mistakes.  Its not that they are "permanent" but a misplay can stall you for a couple turns which will give the opponent a window to win it.  If you survive those couple turns, then you'll be on an even playing field again -- as long as you don't make another mistake =)  I like it a lot, though I think my g/f likes Lost Cities much more...

This gets easier after two or three plays.  It's ok the first time, but there will be a little stop-starting as you fathom what the different tribes do and the best ways to utilise them.  It's a good one for medium brain-burning.  There's a lot of strategy in it, so I wrote my first strategy guide for this Site about it. I'd put it a mite lower than Battle-Line for that particular aspect -I think Battle-Line is one that Babel players would like, and is a slightly better game.  Also similar in feel to Babel is Saga (2004), which is in one sense a mirror image - it has the settlements having the special powers and the knights/tribes just having to defend/attack them.  In Babel, it's the tribes that have the powers and you defend the territories/towers that have no powers.  One thing appears clear,  if you like either Babel or Saga,  you're very likely to enjoy the other!

Only a few plays, but seems quite an interesting little game:  plenty of interaction, rather vicious, but such that it "ain't personal."  Not a CCG-like, really -- rather unique.  We'll see how it stands up.


Ok, over time it becomes a longer game (once you learn to destroy) even when a clear leader is in place.  A bit dull, if still requiring clever play.

After one game play, I think Babel is a good 2-player game. I find few games that play immediately well, and this is one of them. It's simple and elegant. It was a bit confusing at first to figure out rules, but spend some time downloading BGG player aids, and you won't believe that it was ever an issue. I can see how people consider this game cutthroat because you can easily  steal a temple level from your opponent, level an opponent's temple to the ground, steal and destroy played cards, and force a discard of half a player's hand. As a 2-player game, this doesn't bother me (yet!) because it's easy to recover from (so far). You just have to be mindful of the winning conditions.

Oops - I just realized that my first game was played incorrectly. We were playing the Assyrians wrong - we were only destroying the top-most temple level, instead destroying the entire temple at a particular construction site. For future plays, I hope that Babel is highly replayable with different strategies being effective. I also hope that the Assyrians card doesn't push the game to the too-cutthroat-for-me category.

2015 UPDATE: There are other two player games that I'd rather play that don't involve a deep read into the rule book and OP cards.

{3 plays} From my original 5 rating: "I want to like it more, but both plays have been very unsatisfying."  Well, my 3rd play was a lot better, and not just because the tiles flipped right for me... because, in fact, I felt they flipped even worse than before!  But the game finally clicked a little for me, and I was able to "play" around the bad luck.  Still not great, but at least I see why people like it now.

RATING: 6
Intriguing two player game where you have to figure out how to best use the cards.  The migration action along with the tribe actions lead to interesting tactical decisions.  In the end though, it still seemed a bit too random for me with the various cards you can or cannot draw.

Note: You should probably make a house rule to draw the cards for yourself at the end of your turn so you can plan a bit, instead of waiting until the other player finishes.

One of the few 2-player games that actually feels like a duel/battle. It has very tense game play due to the very erratic nature of the scores.

This game is a strange little beast. It is slightly more complex than the average Kosmos 2-player I have tried, and it is at the same time much more interactive.
It is almost tactical, it is quite chaotic and luck is definitely in here. But it is quite fun to be aggressive, and reacting to the havoc caused by your opponent is full of interesting decisions.
This is a lesser known opus by Uwe Rosenberg, but it is indeed a very good filler for two.

Initial Impression: This 2 player card game has some of the most ruthless direct interaction I've ever experienced in a card game. You are constantly trying to build up your towers for points while tearing down those of your opponents. This can result in some really wild and swingy game turns and the game can end abruptly.

Was one of my favorite games for a while, which is a bit of a surprise for me.  It plays fairly quickly (something I was concerned about given the multiple possible ending phases), and while each tribe does indeed do something very powerful, this is balanced out by the fact that the tribe cards must all be consecutive, and that your little token needs to be at the present spot.  The game becomes one of card play and manipulation as you figure out where and how to move things.  Interesting how an unlimited number of actions (apart from the single migrate) don't actually unbalance the game.  Quite fun.

The end-game is a little bit fiddly, but it's there for balance.

One of the strongest, but also the most confrontational, of the Kosmos 2-player series.

A very well-themed game to vividly portray the rising and toppling of the Babel tower. You are only allowed to attack your opponent *directly*. Will either hate your opponent or hate this game! 

Not too happy with the sale price. The production quality is low, card paper is thin and with okay printing quality and cheap coating. The gameboard is fine. I'd expect it a Made-in-Germany with the price I paid for, instead of a Made-in-China. March/02/2014

Indeed, it's directly confrontational, just as everyone says, yet so far it seems like a challenging puzzle more than a bitter fight.  I like the fact that single moves can completely alter the score, and that actions can be chained together to create just such clever moves.

Components are very nice, which seems to be typical for a Kosmos game.  The cards feel great, and the tribes deck shuffles easily.  The square cards of the temples deck are too hard to shuffle.

Babel is a very fun two-player game.  Unfortunately, the wonky endgame destroys the many good qualities.  At the end it feels rather like a crapshoot due to the absolutely wild swings of points.

Not as mean as reviews made it out to be. Gotcha mechanic is thematic: rival tribes can attack opponent temples. 

Rules are not as bad as review made it out to be. Discard a card from hand to move your player piece to that color spot on the board. You can only build a temple or lay down cards where your player piece is. 3 same cards lets you do special power; discard one of those cards if you use power. Play until you don't have any moves left. Simple.

It is really a fun game. Only as complex as remembering what the special powers do: force a discard, take cards, steal temple, distroy temple, skip temple build restrictions.

Sleeved (Nation cards)

// This is a game my wife picked up that I had never heard
about, so I had basically no expectations. I found it to be
pretty good - but has some frustrating elements like having
your opponent knock down the temple you're working on, or
stealing a level from it, or stealing your cards, or even
making you discard half your hand. All of those things
integrate well enough with the flow of the game that it
doesn't feel too harsh - and really, the game would be
too weak without those things, but I really need to be in
the right mood to play a game like this so I don't get
frustrated and take those things personally.

Excellent, and a really tricky little game. Takes a few plays to get a handle on all the possible things to do in a turn and the characteristics of the tribes. But then it became one of my favourite games, and it gets better the more we play it - but note, it is not a light game. To play well, one cannot be afraid to be cutthroat - this is not a game for pairs who try to avoid confrontational play. Also, your situation can change dramatically in the course of a single turn, which turns some people off. The game takes a little flack because of those things in its average rating, I think, but this was a good purchase for my husband and I. I consider it my favourite 2-player-only game, for sure.

This game is lots of fun! Loaded with actions - a refreshing change to the action-starved games we play so much. Luck of the draw with the tribe cards is a little evident, but not any more than with Lost Cities. UPDATE: This actually has quite a bit of strategy (placing temples and tribe cards) and tactics (using the various tribe skills each turn), offering many choices on each turn as to how to build or destroy. Planning ahead how to settle the tribes can set up some nice migration moves. One of the most enjoyable 2-player card games I have played - up there with Lord of the Rings: Confrontation and Battleline.

A little bit of luck and a huge dose of skill. Tough decision in every turn.

Rules are straight forward and it takes 5 minutes to teach the game to someone.

You'll easily win against opponents with less experience. But they'll catch up fast and if you face an equal opponent be prepared for a nerve-wracking match.

No negatives - just if you don't like competitive and confrontational games: stay far away!

I really enjoy Babel. It's a great little two player game that sets up quickly and takes 10-20 minutes to play.  The play is balanced and strategic, with just the right amount of luck in the form of card drawing.  However, much of your progress in the game comes by disrupting your opponent's game.  There are strong "take that!" mechanisms.  For my girlfriend and I, this is not a problem.  We have fun disrupting each other's game and don't take it personally. But if you are a sore loser, this game may not be for you.

RATING: 5
Not a bad game, but somewhat frustrating because of how little control you have over which temple cards will show up. I think if there were a more accessible market for acquiring temple levels the game would be much more strategic, and therefore much improved. As it is, it seemed like the the winner is pretty much determined by the luck of the draw.

This is a solid two player game with a solid screw-your-opponent aspect. If you have an opponent that can't handle that (ie significant other) steer clear. But if you like that kind of thing... There is a fair amount of luck involved when drawing the cards, but enough tactics to make up for it.

Great high-conflict two-player game. My only complaint is sometimes the game moves backwards pretty far if you totally destroy each other so much that everyone reverts from higher scores to low scores. But it is quick enough to not be frustrating. Highly recommend it. Simple rules and a lot of fun.

Pretty decent little two-player back and forth battle.  Trying to maneuver all of your guys into the right positions to both punish your opponent while helping you build your temples is harder than you'd think.  Sometimes you're at the mercy of the luck of the draw, but overall it works pretty well.

Interesting game of building temples in five different locations. Try to get groups of threes to use the different races special abilities. I do think you are very dictated a lot of the time by what is drawn but then again you still have to make the most out of it. Rules are written badly too and need clarifying all over the place. 2 Plays.

This game will have you making clever plays on a regular basis, which is really fun. However, some of those clever plays are going to punish your opponent so severely that they'll be worse off than when they started the game.

Unsure about this. Seemed like you need to get the right cards to go off in a single turn and win. The destructive power each player weilds and their ability to steal seem beyond their constructive ability. I guess that is what the game is about. Not sure if I like it or not.

I really admire the unique design of this game.  The way that the cards are moved about is extremely clever.  However, you have to be in the right state of mind to play this.  You have to be able to not take anything personally, as much of the game is spent knocking down the other player's progress rather than building up your own.

A very mean tit-for-tat game with significant luck that is difficult to mitigate with any sort of risk-management. Light, mean, two-player. Not going to get much play at home - too mean.

The rules are complex and fiddly on first reading, but settle down to turn out quite simple on playing.  Very luck driven at the minor level -- what you can do on any turn is very much dictated by your card draws -- but rewards a slightly more pensive approach over the long game.  Engaging, but not as interesting as say Lost Cities.  Shallower too -- and seems increasingly shallow the more I play it.

A fantastic German card game that's refreshingly smashmouth- brutal and featuring direct confrontation for a change.  Yes, there's plenty of luck-of-the-draw and your plans can be easily waylaid by a shrewd opponent so if that's not OK with you then you won't like this.  Which is too bad for you, because this is one of the best of the 2-player Kosmos line.

I'll have to go read the faq or something. It seems interesting, but severely whacked. You can spend half the game building a nice temple, then, without any warning or possibility of defense, your opponent drops 3 Assyrians and completely destroys your temple. Gee, that was fun. I think I like it, but the house rule that comes to mind that I'm going to have to try next time is: you cannot use the special power of an army unless the army (at least 3 contiguous of the same type) were there at the end of your previous turn. This gives opponents a small opportunity to react. Assyrians may need to be nerfed all together. Maybe only 2 levels can be burnt? I dunno. Something has to be done it seems. Rating will go up if I feel that I've found a better balance.

My girlfriend got Babel on the assumption that 'it would be like Lost Cities'. And indeed, it bears some resemblance to that particular game. In the beginning of a hand, Babel is quiet and polite, but that changes near the end, when players shamelessly prey on their opponents in order to secure the points they need for victory, causing major score fluctuations. Not everyone enjoys this particular trait. Sometimes this phase goes on a bit too long, turning it into a mild war of attrition where the winner is not always the one with the cleverest card placement. Babel is quite a tactical game, but the tactics never became boring because the combinations you form kept the game lively. There aren't cookie cutter patterns, instead you must decide how to string together the basic elements into a devastating attack. Despite me mildly liking the game, my partner quickly soured on it. She didn't like the see-sawing and in her opinion needless confrontation, and from some point onwards refused to play this game anymore. So in the end I suggested we sell it off, and she agreed without any arguments. She really must not like it. Let that serve as a warning: both players must enjoy Babel's agressive nature for it to be a success. 

[b]Update[/b] Replayed the game many years later after writing the above: I dislike the see-sawing much more than I used to. The combo-building is not particularly engaging, and the two steps forward and four steps back-feeling quickly becomes a grating annoyance. Downgraded my rating as a consequence.

This game doesn't get enough credit.  It is packs quite a bit of fun.  A little luck, a little strategy, and little "take-that".

Played this for a couple years now and think this is one of the better two player games with conflict.

This game was a big hit with the wife.  I think that was helped by the fact that she won the first six games we've played.  I still usually lose at this one to her.

A good game for 2.  Try to build up your towers and at the same time knock down your opponent's towers, while he tries to do the same thing to you.  Get the player's aid - it makes it a lot easier to learn the game. Without it, you will be fumbling around for the first few games.

This little game takes awhile to teach, but plays very quickly once you get the hang of it.

Components: Nice board, workable cards with distinctive yet unattractive imagery and layout. The stone figures are a pleasure to handle.

Experience: Very interesting game. Too much of a tug-of-war for me, with players almost reaching their goal, then having their temples stolen or smashed; but setting up my cards for the big, power-wielding turns is interesting. In that sense, the game has a bit of turn-programming in it. I enjoy mixing-and-matching the different moves during my turn, cobbling together a strategy. There are huge swings of power, and the game can last much, much longer than it should.

Despite reading comments that gave me second thoughts, I still bought Babel, since I liked many of the other 2-player small box games.  Have only played 2-3 times, but seems like the game keeps going and going...too easy for players to sabotage their opponents' temples, especially high value ones.  Too much back-and-forth.  Reminds me of "sweeping armies" aspect of Risk.

Yet another top-shelf Kosmos offering. A non-collectible two-player card game with a lot of tense hand-managment decisions. A high-conflict game not suitable for those with thin skins. But a great game of decisions and hand management. 

I'm a little baffled at the degree to which Germans are politically correct. Since when is killing all men in opponent's area called 'Eviction'? We call that putting them to the sword. 'Capturing' opponents looks an awful lot like enslavement, and removing an opponents temple looks like good old-fashioned razing them to the ground. Silly Germans.

Possibly the best of the Kosmos 2-player line, this one offers greater depth of strategy than the others, but with a slightly higher learning curve. Worth the payoff.  Pulling off that "super turn" where you manage to set your self up to do 10 things in a row is incredibly satisfying.

If the game has a fault, it's that it can  often go on way too long. Maybe the victory conditions could have been a tad better to alleviate this problem, but I'm not sure what to suggest. With better vic conditions (for a shorter game) I'd probably rate this a 9 or 10.

I didn't really like this game as I felt very little control over what I could due in the game based on the cards that are drawn.  One turn, I may have the proper suits of cards to go and start temple at a location or add to it, but the temple cards don't really match my locations.  Alternatively, I could have really good temple cards available but not have th cards to move to the proper spot to take advantage of this.  In my one play of the game, the game came down to ending when the temple stack would exhaust which means my opponent had the last move of the game, which gave a tremendous amount control on how to win, using the temple stealing suit.  It all just felt too luck based to me and just not overly enjoyable.

A full on fest of assault, defend, construct, demolish, deploy, depopulate, march, counter-march, action and reaction.  Simple components, but wonderfully deep and saucy gameplay choices!  Once through the learning phase, this game is a devilish joy to play.  If you have trouble with conflict situations, a few rounds of Babel will change your perspective, by testing & retesting your mettle in a very enjoyable way. Great fun even after a series of crushing defeats. And oh, the fleeting glory of victory...Addictive!

2 player card game in the kosmos series, in which you fight a battle to get your own temples build. But in the meantime prefent your oponent to build his temples. Rules are a little struggle but once you know them a nice game comes to fruition

This Kosmos 2p game is unique for its screw your opponent mechanics. It will not be liked by some for this virtue alone. 

I like the dynamics of this game. Big point swings can come through clever play. For whatever reason, it just doesn't work well with my 2p partner. My rating reflects that, it's a well-designed game. I'd like to find somebody to play this one with though.

[b]Rating based on - 5 plays, 2 player[/b]
Highly aggressive, cutthroat Uwe Rosenberg set collection offering. Build up your temples, watch the other person tear them down or steal your work using the powers of their biblical tribes. Repeat until one person has 15 points and the other less than 10. If one person already has 10, then the first to 20 wins unless somebody drops below 10. Different and clever system of play which relies heavily on the right cards at the right time. Was enjoyable, but wasn't completely sold on it after the first play.

After a few more plays...It has one or two nice ideas but it feels rather simplistic overall which leads to a kind of unfinished feeling. I find myself re-reading the rules trying to spot if I am missing something but it's probably one of those games like [thing=19999][/thing] that I don't 'get' in spite of other people saying how brilliant it is. Half the card powers don't seem that interesting, it feels quite dependent on the cards that you draw or that you place out in the temple stack at the end of your turn, and I notice that even when we [i]can[/i] use the destructive card powers to destroy a temple, or to make the other person discard half their hand of cards we tend not to exercise the option. We feel that it just prolongs the game into a needless back and forth and the game simply does not have enough elements to make it interesting enough to drag it out. 

Sometimes you both just sit there aimlessly because you are both on level 1 and the temple stacks only show 5s and 6s – you can't steal a temple level, and you can't skip one either so you just play the waiting game. Plus you can't do anything to influence the temple stacks. Ending can be rather abrupt and anticlimactic - “OK, I build a temple level here, and again, and again (because you conveniently drew the cards I needed at the end of your turn)...then I move to there...then I migrate my people to where I am...I use their special ability to destroy your temple...now you're below 9...I win!” My impression is that there is just not enough here for experienced gamers. However, is this a game you'd want to play with [i]beginning[/i] gamers? :what: Not really sure what the target market it. It's simple and easy enough to teach to kids or non-gamers, and has enough luck that they can win against an experienced player even as a newbie – something at the level of [thing=66171][/thing] I'd say, but the 'take that' element would probably lead to hurt feelings. I guess YMMV. Just not our preferred style of game.

Buen juego de cartas para dos. Aunque hay ciertos toques de azar que pueden ser muy importantes en determinados momentos, el gran abanico de posibilidades que ofrece en cada turno lo hace muy interesante, y con mucha interacción. Lo peor es que los vuelcos en la puntuación pueden volverse continuos hacia el final y alargar las partidas o decantarlas en un golpe de suerte.

Nice two player game. But I would warn not to play this with children (the young and old ones ;-) ) that do not like to be 'bullied'. The game is designed to block your opponent if you want to win! So I would not advice this to play with children who are easily dissapointed when loosing a game.
But if you like to tease.... this is 'the' game to play!

Nice "take that" 2-player card game.  The gameplay feels is unique,  unconventional, and requires thinking "outside the box".  There's a lot of building & building only to see temples crumble before your very eyes.  While it's not my favorite of the 2-player KOSMOS series, I believe it may be one of their best.  Grade: B-

RATING: 6
Yes, the luck of the draw does affect the game quite a bit but since there is so much of it, it tends to average out over the course of the game.  Interesting in many aspects; don't think that the Assyrians are necessarily the best tribe, it all depends on the present situation on the board.  Rated this one down after a few rather bland games where the draws (either nation or temple) really through the game out of whack one way or another.

Very good 2 player game, perhaps the best in the Kosmos 2p series (though it may depend on what you're up to, as Blue Moon, Dragonheart & Heave Ho are equally good, but all very different). Weird that I discovered it this late. It feels a bit like a puzzle trying to see the most interesting and devastating moves and there are so many ways of how to do damage. Quite some decisions to make, but still not a hard game. And a very interesting end game as well, where victory or defeat could be just that one card away.

RATING: 6
Babel is an unusually aggressive game in the Kosmos two-player series. There is plenty of direct conflict and many of the special actions only exist to help you tear down the sand castles your opponent built. In addition, defensive options are severely limited and largely ineffective so in this case the best way to defend really is to attack.

Turns are very tactical, with the immediate actions often very much dictated by the card draws but that's not to say that amidst all the chaos and the collapsing temples a superior long-term strategy is entirely without its merits.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
First impression of this game is good. It's easy to learn but difficult to master.  We especially like the fact that you really get to taunt your opponent and that the game can end at any given moment.

You have to really pay attention!

RATING: 7
This is a nice tactical game where you always search for ways to combine your different races in the best possible way. Most race-powers are extreme strong which leads to a very swingy game where the vp-difference can easily change by 5+ points per turn.
The game is quite destructive - don't play it with people who don't like it to be nasty to each other in games.

A very interesting Kosmos 2-player card game from Uwe Rosenberg. It's true that it is a very confrontational and sometimes dirty game, but players can prepare for potential oncoming attacks if they are able to play their cards right. I don't believe this game is too much about "luck" as some have said.  There is actually a lot to think about here and often a good way to play a hand of bad cards presents itself with some planning.  Although Babel isn't my favourite (maybe because it plays a little... weirdly) there really is no other game like it.  If you are looking for a 45 minute game of meanness done well, Babel is it!

Despite my love for Bohnanza and Mamma Mia (Uwe Rosenburg) I feel the designers of Babel made this game unneccessarily complicated and spiteful.

Two-player solitaire this sure ain't. Four of the five card powers are used to kick your opponent right in the crotch. And it doesn't stop there, because since you can never be sure of your lead, you must always kick your opponent while he's down. Brutal. Took me a few games to get a feel for this one, and I'm glad I stuck with it, cause it's a good mean time. Homemade. Go Fish cards + Flinch cards = Babelfish!

I had always assumed that Bohnanza was Uwe Rosenberg's magnum opus. Until I tried Babel, that is. It's a joy for those who like complex tactical situations, and involves a nice mix of setting yourself up to take advantage of future opportunites and adjusting to unpredictable situations.

As much as I like Babel, I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to the average BGG user.  It belongs to a breed of games that I tend to enjoy but that I know many BGGers do not.  It's a "chaotic thinker's game" - a game that requires a great deal of thought and finesse but that can be very unpredictable at the same time.  If you don't like games where bad luck can undermine your intricate planning, don't even give Babel a second look.

In many ways, this is a "non-euro, eurogame." What do I mean by this? In most eurogames, you're presented with a relatively small number of choices on a turn. (For example, in Ticket to Ride you can: claim a route, draw cards, or draw tickets.) But in Babel, since you can perform multiple actions on a turn, the number of choices is bewildering and not everyone will appreciate this. I think it's great and opens up the possibility of very clever, entirely non-obvious, moves.

It does mean that there's much more of a learning curve than with other games of this type, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing.

Very interesting and very confrontational card game that feels like a puzzle, but luck of the draw may be a little high at times. You must use your people cards to build temples, but the special powers of the peoples are the soul of the game. It's always tense, as you also want to prevent your opponent from using some powers against your temples and tribes. The small board is not really necessary and could be easily replaced with a few cards, but it's a nice addition.

One, if not THE best 2 player game and a very aggressive one with a huge amount of interaction.

If you don´t like losing things you built up, this isn´t something for you, but if you like direct interaction and fighting for resources, this is a really great game!

Sure, you draw cards, so there is some luck involved, but as there's so much you can do and set up, it's not as bad as it may seem at first. I played many games and rarely lost, which proves that.

I wish Uwe could and would still do great games like this one instead of the same old overproduced stuff he does nowadays.

Uwe Rosenberg before Uwe Rosenberg was on everyone's map (i.e., folks might have known him for Bohnhanza). This is a vicious little game because attacking your opponent is often the best move to improve your own relative position (and 4 out of 5 cards encourage direct aggression). It is a deeply tactical game that can go either way (like Feld's Roma) with some room for clever card play (i.e., you can relocate the top 3 cards of any stack to another stack, allowing for further building opportunities but more often than not, allowing for further aggressions). While I haven't played all of the KOSMOS games, I have yet to encounter another 2-player game that is as cut-throat as this one (without breaking down into a Munchkin-esque exercise where no one ever gets anywhere). I love this type of game but it certainly isn't for everyone.

For an uneventful game like this, i found it had too much luck in it.
I didn't hate it, i just wouldn't play it ever again.
Also the theme is kind of not there.. both sides use the same ancient tribe cards to build 5 towers of babel each..?

手札のマネジメントもあるし、場の状況を見て判断する機会もそこそこあるものの神殿のめくりで勝負が決するという印象が強く、それは悪いことではないけれど、あんだけあれやこれやさせておいて？という気分になってしまう。

RATING: 7
Better than most of the other "light two-player card games" that I've tried. I think a large part of that is because it has you drawing 3-cards per turn which leaves you less at the mercy of a bad luck and makes it long term planning a little more feasible. It also features more "take that" (temple level stealing, emigration, temple destruction, hand halving) elements than more popular games like Lost Cities or Battle Line.

The rules are easy to learn and straightforward and I'm always a bit of a sucker for card games that aren't just obviously recycling a standard deck of cards (like Lost Cities and Battle Line do).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
As a 2 player game this is a highly confrontational game requiring you to steal, destroy, and screw over your opponent actively every chance possible in order to win.  Games play reasonably fast, so getting crushed isn't that bad as you can get a fresh start with the next game.  Very simple mechanics makes it easy to teach.  Definitely a keeper for those times you want to be highly aggressive.

I have played Babel several times now and I remain impressed with the game. Although the element of chance is significant (this is a simple card game after all), it is moderated by the large number of tactical options. Most games eventually fall into a tug-of-war situation with the lead swapping between the players and the winner not being determined until the game actually ends.

Another strong two player game from the Kosmos line.  Like Lost Cities and Battle Line this one features a healthy dose of card management, but also throws in some special card powers including the ability to directly interact with your opponent's cards.  In fact, to do well you must be constantly thinking about how to best use your cards to both build your temples, attack your opponent's positions, and protect yourself from attack.

RATING: 6
I find this just a little like Battleline actually but I like that more and they are quite different.

A good dose of luck in picking up tribe cards which are critical to ALL your actions, especially moving. Then there is luck in the temple cards as well, planning is required however and some clever plays are possible. 

Lots of screwage and fairly short play time are pluses. A little too restricted and too chaotic or volatile (unusual for a 2 player game) but still good for an occasional play. 

Update: 6.5 => 6  The rules are just a tad fiddly and if you haven't played for awhile some review is required, more than I want to do for this sort of game. 

=> traded

RATING: 5
Good game, well designed.  Build temples with cards and use the powers of various tribes to get what you want: the highest temple score before your opponent.  The only thing I don't like about the game is that it can change too quickly, and it's difficult to build a defence around it.

Hmmm. Lots of things I like about this game, but it seems to primarily come down to the luck of the draw when the &quot;discard half your hand&quot; rule is used aggressively.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Preliminary rating is a six. Definitely a lot of randomness (card draws and card reveals), so the only question is whether or not skillful / subtle card play significantly impacts the game. It might. It might not. What's certain is that the game involves an extraordinary amount of confrontation. Pillaging other players' temples, stealing "temple levels" (theme gaffe), stealing tribe cards, etc. The game's internal clock runs down very slowly, so it feels like who can keep their footing the longest in a slug-fest. I'm ambivalent at best. 

Odin's Ravens and Jambo remain undisputed as the best in the Kosmos two-player series.

RATING: 7
Un underrated game - I say so just because it seemed to me that the CW of BGG said that it was one of the lesser Kosmos 2-player efforts.  But I definitely enjoyed this much more than many of its more celebrated relatives.  A very tactical game where it can be very difficult to plan too far in advance because the situation could be altered dramatically before you can implement your plan, usually by having your cards (in your hand, on the table, or your temple cards) disappear.  That said - it's a pretty brutal game where you go back and forth stealing and hurting your opponent.  Since it happens so often (and since there are only 2 players) it doesn't really seem mean spirited at all.  The only drawback I can see is if the game stretched out too long, which has not been a problem for me, but I could see how an unusually balanced game could teeter back and forth for a while.  Uwe Rosenberg sure is a versatile designer!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Very unbalanced, random game. There's a nice twist in deciding how to split your cards between moving and populating, but the overpowering effect of triple cards seem to undo any planning or skill. Pretty art, though.

After four plays of this game, I am not sure what to think about it.  I think that there may be some strategy but there seems to be a little too much luck for my taste.

I will have to see after more plays and with different people.

I can understand some of the criticisms, but to me, this is a fun, bumpy ride. Still need to get a better grasp on strategy, if there really is any. Wild swings of fortune ensue, and your fate will depend in part on the order in which the temple cards appear. One quibble- the migration and emigration rules can cause confusion. I have fun playing this, and think of it every now and then when it comes time to play something, but there are too many other games I'd rather play. But if a round of Babel were offered, I'd accept.

Babel is one of the best 'games for 2 players'  in Kosmos-series. It's biggest strengthness is interactivity:  you have to react all the movements that your opponent makes or you'll lose. Babel tastes a little same like Lost Cities, Battle Line or Balloon Cup, but offers much more strategies and fights AND feels at least of all like a solitaire. A very good cardgame if you want a lot of interactions.

2 plays.  This is a game that must really be played twice to fully understand.  Or, if there's a player with more experience, they should really give some advice before the first game begins.  But at a minimum, remember - don't try to make unprotected triples (the game revolves around making sets of cards to activate special abilities).  My first game was a total waste of 10 minutes, the second was a hard fighting hour of back and forth, down to the wire action.

Get "Jambo", "Hera & Zeus", "Caesar & Cleopatra" and "Hive" before this.  Still a fairly decent game but way too many cards with extreme effects (destroy tower, steal tower, steal people) to have real strategy.  Yet, despite the impossibility of really planning, long term thinking is still the key to victory, which rapidly get tiresome.  Not a bad game, just overshadowed by other out there.

This is not a card game for the faint of heart!  To see your 6 level temple get obliterated by your opponent's Assyrians can be painful!  Still, I found this game to be an interesting blend of set collection in the people cards which grant special powers to go outside the rules and manipulate the game into your favor.  There is a lot of potential interaction between players with the different powers of the peoples as long as you continue to have sets of three connected to each other!  Be careful in playing too many cards and limiting your options in the following turn!

One of my favorite 2-P games, possibly because my record is something like 90-1. Game suffers from the "Big Play" syndrome - one big play (where you simultaneously increase your score, while decreasing your opponent's) normally decides the game. It's all a question of who pulls the trigger on the Big Play first.

The best of the Kosmos series. This easy to learn, quick-playing 2-player card game offers an extraordinary number of strategic options and each game plays differently. Winning play requires a combination of strategy aimed at building your own empire while simultaneously attacking the other player's.

Those who don't like this game seem to be people who don't enjoy games where players must actively disrupt each other's plans. To me, that's a feature that makes the game a lot of fun between two similarly minded players who can good-naturedly curse each other.  This is one of my favorite games.

This game is quite good.  It requires a lot of thinking because you have a lot of options on each turn.  It also is very confrontational, which I don't mind, others might.

RATING: 6
Another beautiful game from Kosmos, at times a brain-burner (planning out complex moves) and at times quite frustrating (as a temple comes crashing down or you can't quite do that big impressive move). Many options some turns and hardly any others, the game can stagnate if the wrong temples are coming out, but it is a quite fine game for the planner and for the more destructive part of you too. Many have already mentioned it is quite antagonistic and that is certainly true, but if that is OK, there is a good game here - possibly the best Kosmos 2-player?
Update (Dec 2012) replayed it for the first time in a while and found it dull. Too many turns doing nothing or doing things for the sake of burning cards rather than because they are a good move. Perhaps a bad draw but lowered my rating to a 6.

Ziel des Spiel ist es, an den Flüssen Euphrat und Tigris möglichst beeindruckende (also hohe) Tempel zu bauen. Dafür stehen jedem Spieler fünf Bauplätze zur Verfügung, die farbig gekennzeichnet und einem der fünf angesiedelten Völker zugeordnet sind. 
Das Spannende ist, dass die Völkerkarten gleich mehrere Funktionen erfüllen. So steht man ständig vor dem Problem, dass man jetzt entweder mit der Karte reisen oder sie anlegen will, um z. B. die Völkerfunktion nutzen zu können. Es vergeht schon oft einige Zeit, bis man den taktisch klügsten Zug ausgetüftelt hat, da man ja alle Aktionen in beliebiger Reihenfolge ausführen kann.

I really like this game. It seems to have a reputation as a "brutal" game, so my wife avoided playing it with me for months. When I finally got her to try it, she really enjoyed it. Yes, you can do lots of damage to your opponent in a few moves, but they can usually reciprocate, so all's fair. I love the dynamic of trying to manage the sets of cards - using migration when needed. This is another game that really balances luck and strategy. The best laid plans can be messed up if you can't draw the card(s) necessary to carry them out. On the other hand, you really need to think about when and where you play your cards if you are going to win. The first few times through, we missed the rule about using any set of three cards to force your opponent to discard half their cards. Without this rule, we tended to hoard cards, which kind of ruins the game. Once you get this rule down, however, it forces cards down and the game really has a nice pace. Overall, a very solid and enjoyable game.

Played only one incomplete game.  Not sure about this.  Seems that it could drag on for a very long time.  I think I prefer games that will inevitably wind down to an end.  This seems like it could potentially run on and on and on.

Rating based on 2 players.

I was a bit worried going into this game because the rules seem a little fiddly (even if the gameplay isn't), and in practic they kinda are, as there are lots of "little" rules to remember. However once you get going this game is a lot of fun, and playing a combo where you steal your opponent's top temple level, destroy the rest of it, then make all their people desert... yeah, that's pretty satisfying!

I've heard this this game can turn into a slog as there is no defined end point, but this hasn't been my experience so far. One thing to keep in mind is that this game isn't for pussyfooting around:you must be aggressive and show no mercy--while also keeping your defense up!--so if being "mean" is at all a concern, this is NOT a game for you.

One of my new favorites! The confrontation in the game is balanced by the necessity of building your own temples. The cards give you lots of options per turn (stealing levels, forcing discards, building, etc...). Since there is no limit to what you can do each turn, some truly devastating combos can be unleashed. I speak from the experience of being on the receiving end of the devastation! I loved the balance between destruction/creation and multiple choices per turn. My favorite 2 player with friends that do not mind conflict.

The trick to making cutthroat games work is to make that type of play THE strategy as opposed to just an option that might become a sticking issue with player is one person at the table is more prone to backstabbing than the other.  Babel is such a game where victory lies in seeing those combos on both sides of the table and being ready and willing to take the opportunity at any moment.  It is beyond just a game where players sit there and both perform actions to a goal, Babel is a contest, a fight, and it has all the thrills and emotion of such an event.  Highly, and with no irony, recommended for couples play.

This game is GREAT.  I recently dropped its rating a bit, but it is still an awesome game and well worth checking out.

Two co-mingling mechanincs:

First, one deck of cards must be "built up" in ascending order.  

Second, five suits which when played correctly have special "abilities" which interact with the afore mentioned mechanic, as well as with your opponents planning.

The result is a "timing" heavy and combo charged game.  Very good, tactical, and tense.

On the ancient bank of the Euphrates, players race to build more temples, represented by temple cards that must be built in numerical order. Cards represent the five nationalities in the game, each nation having their own power. I wanted to like this game, with the special abilities of the races, but what made it protracted was when temple numbers kept flipping out that were not useful, then we would have to find an alternate play (trying to disrupt the opponent somehow, or set up for the next big move), that made the game kind of frustrating. But maybe that's what the design was, with the random flipping of tile numbers at the end of a player's turn. Still, some neat ideas.

Because Babel is only a 2-player game the meanness didn't leave me feeling victimized as I was the only possible target for the game's brutal cards, unlike in a similarly mean, but multi-player game, where many opponents could direct their attacks at me. I just assumed that any build-up of points or cards was a target that my opponent had to attack in order to stave off losing the game and realized that I would do the same. Empathizing with my opponent's situation was key to avoiding frustration and allowed me to enjoy this strategic little game.

RATING: 7
Ottimo gioco per due giocatori che spesso gioco con mia moglie. Tra le caratteristiche più apprezzate la velocità, le meccaniche fluide e la semplicità che però non va a discapito della strategia. Tra i difetti il fatto che sia un tantino astratto e che rimane un gioco di carte. Gioco comunque molto consigliato.

RATING: 6.5
A very under-rated game, and one which is doubly enjoyable because you can convince yourself that you're performing deep and thorough analysis when you're really only going through the motions. A pioneer in terms of using the same cards for a multitude of actions, and - after some jockeying for position - comfortably our favourite of the Kosmos range. To find out why, play it until you stumble upon the crucial game-making session that takes the best part of ninety minutes: then you too will be hooked. There's a reason why Babel doesn't appear on many trade lists.

This is a very nice looking game with a central board reminiscent of Lost Cities.  It turns out to be much faster moving than I had anticipated, and should play even faster once both players are familiar with the special skills of the various tribes.  I enjoy the challenge of mounting a successful sneak attack on my opponent, while trying to protect myself from the same.  A good way to characterize this game is "Do it to them before they do it to you."  Even though this element of screwing over your opponent is central to the game, it doesn't lead to bad feelings since it is fairly constant on both sides.  What I mean to say is that this is not the sort of game where one player can gain a huge advantage over the other.  You get had, but you know you will have your revenge in short order.  (4+3)  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pretty cutthroat for a two-player card game, so be forewarned that those who don't like much of a screwage factor aren't going to be too comfortable with this, as with special cards you can wipe out your opponent's cards or part or all of their temples (which is what you use for scoring). 

Beyond that, however, it's a nice design because there are many choices to make, and you can only get better by playing this a lot to acquire experience. So there is much room for improving and becoming adept at this game, but it does take some time: I'd rate this as more of a medium complexity game, even though it's in the 2-player line. 

At the same time, the rule book is pretty good--albeit with a few hazy portions due to what may be a shaky translation, but basically, game play is pretty intuitive, if not always clear. (Even after 20 plays I still found myself looking up rules clarifications.)  Once I played it more, head-to-head, my rating went from a 7 to an 8 (December 2010), as I began to see how much there is to absorb. 

Acquired in trade, September 2010.

Babel is a fantastic two-player game from one of my favourit game sereis: the kosmos 2-player series. Cheap games with high quality components specifically designed for 2 players. This game has a surprising depth that takes a few games to grasp. Many possible card combination provide an unpredictable game whenever you start anew.

- Rule book is quite extensive for this game series. Due to the many different possibilities the game provides, the rules need to be reat with some care, take your time to fully explain the game and test play once to demonstrate different situations and to examplify some rules.

Update: I am still not sure what to think of this game. It is well balanced but I think it lacks flair and the tension doesn't holdthe whole 60 minutes. It doesn't happen that much in the time the game is played. It should be shorter, around 30 minutes. Still not bad. I am lowering my vote to 6, but it may well go up again.

This feels a little like a card game version of Tigris & Euphrates. I like the way you need to gather the tribes to have any power, the way cities can rise and fall from warfare. It has a lot of interesting tactics. 

On the other hand the game begins to feel like a pissing match, as players strive to achieve victory each round at the endgame. I intensely dislike the two-phase victory conditions.

One of the first games we bought. One of the better small two player games. Incredible amount of player interaction for a two player game. I really enjoy it but it rarely hits the table anymore since our collection is growing.

Really cut throat thanks to the actions where you can mess with the other player. Might not be that enjoyable with players who don't like aggressive play. But I love it because of that.

RATING: 7.5
Excellent 2-player tactics game. You're constantly balancing between building up your own temples, attacking your opponent and trying not to set up your opponent for a bigger move.

Who can play?  Strategy game for 2 players.

This is my favorite of the Kosmos 2 player series.  There are such a mind boggling number of clever options, and it's fun to work through them.  There's lots of room for surprise moves even with all those cards face up and in plain view.  Unfortunately, I can't seem to find anyone that shares my enthusiasm for the game.

If you wanted Lost Cities with direct spite, as opposed to passive aggressive spite, this one is it. I don't like the rulebook, as its explanations seemed extremely strange until the game was played through once or twice. Overall, solid filler, but newcomers are absolutely destroyed by a more experienced player.

Traded this for a copy of Settlers of Catan.

For a while, I only played two player games with my wife, who likes Lost Cities and Balloon Cup.  Now that I've exposed other folks to Hera and Zeus, I'm wondering if I haven't been too hard on Babel, which I only played once a long time ago.  I have to re-visit this one with a new approach.

RATING: 6.5
An interesting variation on Knizia's Battleline. Think of Battleline but with a tower instead of flags and with the goal to get a large tower on one column of cards (as opposed to the three consecutive flags or five flags total rule of Battleline). 

The end goal is to get a tall column. The game has a more take-that element since your opponent has the ability to knock down layers of your tower. Interesting game.

Looks vicious! Excited to try it.

UPDATE: Played one time so far and loved it. Absolutely want to try it again. The chains of moves are a very fun mechanic and the "End Game" rule (which we triggered) made for a very tense last 5 minutes of the game.

= 2012-06-25 - R:9.5

Played a few more times. Such a vicious, fun game. It would be easy to get mired down trying to figure out the optimal move, but for now we're just having fun making crazy chains of moves and watching the scores swing back and forth.

= 2013-01-27 - R:8.5

This was one of our first games and while it's still one of our favorites, 9.5 seems high now. This one still comes to the table a couple times a month.

The randomness of the card-draw mechanic seems magnified in the game by the requirement to draw lots of sets at once, making this a game I find hard to enjoy. I just don't see how to play it well - though, the fact I can beat my primary opponent most of the time proves that it can't be just luck... Like Tigris, this game will remain a mystery for me as I don't see myself getting motivated to try it again.

Whilst I see that the game has strategy in it, the feelings of plans frustrated by a run of bad draws means it's not my favourite, even out of the Kosmos 2-player small boxes. Some neat mechanics, and a fairly good value game for the price, but not my personal favourite.

This is my least favorite of the Kosmos 2-player line that I've played. Reading the rules didn't leave me with a clear sense of what I was going to do to win, and each turn I felt like I just did whatever I could with the cards available: no real thought or tactics/strategy possible. The game play felt like tug-of-war and I think that in each of the games we played, the person with the most cards in hand won. Unimpressed after a few plays, I tried to give it another chance but gave up mid-way through because we were bored.

Hera & Zeus and Babel are my two favourties in the Kosmos two player series. Both have depth to them and the replayability is very high. Both need a couple of games under the belt to understand what the cards do and the subtleties of play. Babel is for players who don't mind a bit of aggression in their games - expect constant attacks on your positions. A bit of luck in the cards, but don't judge this one too harshly until you've got a few games under your belt and the chaos has been replaced by the magic of the game. Still, it's more tactics than strategy.

Kosmos 2 szemelyes sorozataban az egyik legkomolyabb darabja. Nem kimondottan csaladi jateknak tervezett mert sok helyre kell figyelni es sok lepes lehetoseg van. Szivesen kiprobalnam ujra mert hirtelen csoppentem egy jatekba es csak felig elolvasott szabaly alapjan jatszottam. A vegere mar belejottem de az elso par lepesben csak tapogatoztam jobbra-balra.

Not bad 2p fare.  Prefer some of the other offerings in the Kosmos line.

It's got a bit of a Battleline feel about it, but not so stripped-back-to-basics.  Definitely more options on your turn than BL, things to think about/moves available (it's all about knowing the combo's of the different powers and using them in the sneakiiest and most efficient way possible), but to my mind it's not as sweet.  The wife is no fan.

Good game though and happy to keep in collection.

RATING: 7
This is a really aggressive game.  On first blush, I though it would be a nice slow build-up to victory.  However, it is so easy to interfere with your opponent that you cannot count on that.  However, you must be careful as too much is not a good thing.  You cannot spend all of your time attacking your opponent without spending some resources building up your own position.  A nice 2-player game, though probably not for some couples.  [03/13/2011]

'Babel' plays like a light war game, condensed into a small card game package. Although the rules are not intuitive in some parts, gameplay is very adversarial and intense. The graphics and artwork are not appealing and look like taken straight from a history book. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Players have a hand of cards comprising a variety of 5 races. These are used to build towers and each has a special ability when used as a set of at least 3 cards. The objective of the game is to move cards tactically so as to build higher towers and hinder the opponent.

Turns move fairly quickly and the game has a nice variety with the race powers. However, things can swing pretty quickly with a good hand and echoing many other peoples' comments: there is a luck factor. But the game plays quickly enough that you can easily go again to mitigate it.

RATING: 7.5
Another beautiful game from Kosmos, at times a brain-burner (planning out complex moves) and at times quite frustrating (as a temple comes crashing down or you can't quite do that big impressive move).  Many options some turns and hardly any others, the game can stagnate if the wrong temples are coming out, but it is a quite fine game for the planner and for the more destructive part of you too.  Many have already mentioned it is quite antagonistic and that is certainly true, but if that is OK, there is a good game here - possibly the best Kosmos 2-player?

Completely random game. Draw good card combos and you win unchallenged. Has one clever mechanism, but that doesn't make a good game. All you're doing in your turn is contemplating over the best move you can do, and this is very boring if you find that move too easily and very frustrating if you can't do anything advantageous at all. As a side effect you're having long downtime because players analyze their situation too much.

Nasty little 2p card game. It's a bit counterintuitive to learn, especially compared to other games in the Kosmos line. Because of this, I did poorly in my first couple games. Unfortunately, I can see that this is a game whose replayability is limited. Once you figure it out, luck of the draw is going to determine play. Other games solve this with opportunities for bluffing, but there are almost none here. Pure nastiness without depth isn't my thing. There's no incentive to get good at it. Once you do, there's nothing left. [i]Until[/i] you do, it's more frustrating than fun.

My initial play(s), early in my gaming "career," seemed too random and chaotic. After some more recent plays (online at feuerteufel.nl), though, I am quite enjoying this game (an early one from the card game master himself!). 

The game is a light, pretty quick and tactical card game, with just a dash of strategy. Or maybe just a pinch? Game play is primarily dictated by the cards you drew this turn, and the opportunities you set for yourself in previous turns. Mostly, you are trying to figure out little logic puzzles: how do you use your cards, in which order and combination, to build your own temples and/or destroy your opponent's. If you like the kind of thinking you do n To Court the King, or even in CCGs or deck building games you may like this game!

Played this with my 6-yr old son. Seems pretty cutthroat, also not really a children's game.

Compared to Omen (good game which my wife vehemently detested) this one is less thematic (simple art, a little set-collect and 'take that') however way, way better in actual gameplay. Components wise Omen was better, but its biggest downfall is that it is possible to completely shut an opponent down up till the point they are just figurines in your glorious win. See my comments on Omen.

This is actually a nice racing game, not too long and with enough catch-up mechanisms to make it replayable and a keeper. Quite like this one.

Very thoughtful and tactical play.  You can't rely on forward planning, which I don't mind.  Sometimes a player might win a game due to getting the perfect cards while the other player gets cards he can't do much with, but I wouldn't call this game luck-dependent.

Make sure to go into it expecting to go from 14 points to 2 points in the course of one turn!

Babel is a simple game of battle solitaire that gets thwarted by the wrong theme.  Sumerians, Hittites, et al working side-by-side?  Each race has overwhelming battle powers such as... skip a level?  And why is Babel even mentioned?  None of it makes any sense, and the rules are fussy to boot.

My wife and I have played two games of this so far, and I am sure we will play more.  I almost didn't buy Babel due to comments about its competitiveness, and I was glad to find that it really isn't a problem.  You just have to realize that it is part of the game that your best move may either help you or hurt your opponent.  This isn't at all like the nastiness that can happen in other games, particularly multi player, where you can get essentially knocked out of the game by one or more of the of the other players.

The game is pretty easy to teach, the main difficulty being the different capabilities of the tribes, but this is handled well with a player aid from this site.  Note that there are a couple of rules questions that are also answered here.

One very underwhelming play.  Seemed barely functional, strategically closed off, and degenerate due to the temple deck distribution.  Very much a game where I take three steps forward, and then hope that you can only punch me in the face enough to make me take two steps back.  There's possibly some interesting interplay here, but it's so impossible to do much to set yourself up strategically that you find yourself hoping for the luck of the draw to save you.  There's also no ability to defend yourself -- your opponent has three Assyrians and the right travel card, and your favorite temple is going to burn.  Not one I'm going to be looking to play again.

I like the way the mechanics come together, but there's something about the end game and the way it rushes along that leaves me wanting more.  Plus, the level cards are drawn and left stacked, so the cards you need to move toward a win can get buried beneath a lot of cards that are useless to you.  As such, parts of the game can be very frustrating.

Φτιάξτε το ψηλότερο κάστρο σε κάθε λάο και καταστρέψτε τα κάστρα του αντιπάλου σας, για να είστε ο νικητής. Ένα καρτοπαίχνιδο με απίστευτες αλληλεπιδράσεις και compo που το κάνει πολύ ανατρεπτικό.

Nice two player game, it is better than most of the kosmos two player games. Exception of course Jambo, what can I say, sometimes I want to play Babel and enjoy it.

I didn't love it; I didn't hate it. I'm not a big fan of games where you can tear down the stuff other people have made (even though I didn't think I'd mind it in a 2P game) as it gives the feeling you're not making any progress.

Who knew you could turn Rummy into a two player punching match? I wish Uwe Rosenberg would channel his mean-streak more often, because this game is loads of fun. It's even more simple than Bohnanza, his most famous light family game...yet I think this one is more fun. Granted, you spend the whole game sabotaging and throwing hay-makers at your opponent, so it doesn't exactly take up the "family game" mantle...but it is extremely easy to teach.

compare to the other rio grande 2 players, this one time wise, may be the longest one and occasionally drags on due to the powers which could be stacked up.. played couple of times now but prefer other lighter games for 2

Nasty game, I enjoy playing this with my GF. This game is not about building up, but about tearing down :) Remember that (evil grin)

Well balanced game, deep game experience, highly conflictive. It's really all destroying and Phoenix of the ashes, a rather destructive game. Don't take it too serious, there's actually quite a bit luck in drawing the cards...

Fun card laying game for two players. The actions from cards can make the score take some pretty wild swings.

Good 2 player game with Audrey

My least favorite game so far in the Kosmos line.

I'm all for confrontation, but this is a slap-happy boxing match where players are only allowed to use their hands for punching, not for guarding.  So the boxers take turns knocking out teeth until one player throws up.

RATING: 6
Played a few times. An interesting, tense game, but for some reason I have not played it in a while and do not really feel like playing it again soon (the lack of opportunities for 2p games might partly explain that). Also, I remember it being a bit too long for my tastes.

One of the best all round two player games i&#039;ve played so far. Pretty easy to introduce, pretty vicious against a worthy opponent. So far i&#039;ve only introduced people and lost every game because i gave them to good advice. But I loved every single game.

Wow what a great game! We played this twice today (only once correctly :)) and it is fantastic. Plenty of opportunity for strategizing, some tactics and tons of good old stab-your-opponent. More like kick him.. then kick him some more once he's down. I love it!

I wasn't that impressed with my first play of this.  Seems like give and take until someone has the correct cards to do what they need to do.  I'll update the rating after more plays.

A vicious little two-player game.  It often goes quickly and brutally, depending on lucky draws, wise play (settlement) patterns, and observant lateral thinking.

After 2+ Plays: My least favorite of the Kosmos 2-player series so far (though I haven't played Crocodile Pool Party).  The Assyrians (Blue cards) really ruin what would otherwise be a decent game.  Not only are they far too powerful, but when they destroy a temple, the cards just come back, and you end up in a loop of destroying and rebuilding the same cards over and over.  Extremely frustrating.

Feels like an OK two player game, one of the better ones in the Kosmos 2-player series. A little complaint about the way the Assyrians destroying ability being so powerful and destructing to the general progress of the game towards a victory.

Overrated game. Besides, too agressive for my wife.

RATING: 8
Feels very open when it comes to choices and you don't feel like the game is holding you back. You organize your turn however you want, do as much as you can or as little as you want in order to save up your cards, and generally try to keep your opponent in check. The game has plenty of hate, so be aware of that going in.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This one rewards repeated plays.  Also, you can set up for some really nice combos and catch your opponent unaware, so, likewise, it's best advised to keep a close eye on what your opponent is doing as well.

Very light on rules, but some really fun gameplay to be had.  Skill outmaneuvers luck; I love it!

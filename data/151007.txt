Just more of the same as the previous set which isn't a good thing since the previous one was far too easy and became very dull very quickly. Not interesting, challenging, or different enough to keep playing. Cancelled our subscription as it was just the same game with a different coat of paint. Sold at FallCon 2015 auction.

RATING: 9
The addition of Ship & Fleet support cards makes Skull & Shackles more involved than Rise of the Runelords, but the rulebook has also been re-organized and re-written a little to reflect that, and it's more substantial overall. I think I prefer the adventure scenarios here, though I thought it was a little strange that there was no progression from Rise to this. Each is compartmentalized into its own experience, but at least they have a lot more advancement potential than, say, the D&D Adventure board games in which you have basically two levels. Anyway, another fine adaptation of the RPG's corresponding Adventure Path into a card game format.

RATING: 4
Bought full set, hoping for improvement on a bland and lifeless first game.

Instead, it's worse. Esoteric and counter-intuitive "ship" concept means the ship is barely in the camera frame. 

Rehashed recycled cards and concepts. Same singular constraining layout (Whack a mole with location decks? Sure, let's play more of that!) 

Jumping off the Pathfinder ship. It clearly has lots its way (if it ever even had it).

I love what Pathfinder ACG is trying to do; getting an RPG experience from a card game is a dream come true for many gamers. It's a tall order -- and no, this is not equivalent to a tabletop RPG -- but it is a really fun game that allows you to make checks rolling dice, progress your character through a story arc, and customize their growth over time. [b]Skull & Shackles[/b] is a great choice if you like a little pirate with your fantasy, and some small additions add to what the original game offered. A fantastic solo game too!

This is a lot more fun with someone else running the different decks. The amount of pre-game setup involved with playing any particular mission is exhausting, especially if you're keeping track of each character's deck for the purposes of playing out a campaign.

The app version of the game does away with a lot of the fiddiliness of deck management, but has some UI problems all its own.

Slightly more difficult than Rise of the Runelords with some more interesting win conditions besides "whack-a-mole".  Unfortunately the theme really does not appeal to me -- enough so that I prefer Runelords despite the gameplay improvements in Shackles.

Skull and Shackles is both a tighter and more refined game than it's predecessor. Scenarios, characters and cards are more interesting mechanically and really begin to explore what possibilities the system has to offer. While most of what's good about PFACG stays true with Skull & Shackles, most points of criticism also stay the same, namely the mindless dice-chucking and ramshackle presentation of what is really a fully fleshed out and expansive story.

It's an enjoyable game, and one that I think can introduce folks to more complicated card/board games, but the cost of the complete experience is a little out of wack (Base Game + the adventure decks) for what you get overall.  It's also very luck based in terms of what cards are drawn, though more-so about the order of the location decks than about the player's deck.  It would be nice if they made it a little more controlled, like putting the henchmen at the bottom half of the decks or something.  Overall, I enjoy playing this game, but I don't intend on picking up the other versions in the same series.

I like the role playing and I like the characters.  The game is fun with the expansions and additional characters.  The setup can be a little tedious with multiple piles of cards to shuffle and re-shuffle.  The rules can be a little ambiguous at first, but once you understand the card language they become natural.

We wanted to like this so much, but the overchallenging unclear rules and wordings, the missing flow, the repetitive mechanics, the walls of text on allmost every card and finally the overall poor component quality disqualified this game for us after just one take on one scenario of one adventure.

This is the best set so far. I have included some class deck cards as well as cards from Wrath of the Righteous and removed cards that never get used. This makes the game easier, but I would rather win every scenario. The fun for me comes from improving my character and finding better gear!

While this improves the gameplay immensely of the Pathfinder ACG series, it's just not quite enough.

I love the idea of the this game, but the execution is a grind. I love the pirates theme and the art is great too. The game lacks mechanically, it's play cards and hope you roll well. The decision making is limited and not that fun. The lack of interaction is a drawback as well.

A significant evolution from Runelords.  The theme is much better implemented, the variety of quests and character abilities is greater and it's overall a better feel.

I read some of the negative comments on this and thought I'd counter some of the arguments.  This game scratches an itch for playing an RPG and character advancement.  I love that you build a character, starting with a selection of basic items and can only get elite items if they wind up in your scenario.  It's true RPG randomness.

I feel the game has a bit of skill and luck factors thrown in there.  "Do I use a Blessing of the Gods to explore again or do I save it for an extra dice later?  I'll save it.  Woah, good thing I did, I just ran into the villian and holy crap I need that extra dice for my check."

You care about what your teammates get in their decks.  I'm constantly suggestion what location my fellow players go to due to the type of cards there.  "You go here Mr. Spellcaster, there are like 4 spells you could possibly find and me and the other guy can't keep spells for the next scenario anyway."  

Now, as for my beefs with the game?  

-Token cards are a piece of retarded for placing at a location.  Give me miniatures instead.  Much easier for location placement.  If nothing else, make all of the characters available to purchase as plastic miniatures I can get in a set.  I tried looking for some and I found a mix of plastic and prepainted and would love to just have a set of plastic figurines, like $2.50 a piece that I could buy for each character (think Runebound world...each game has the character miniatures available to the game - Dungeon Quest, Runebound, Descent, etc.)

-Rules are somewhat scattered.  As an example, it feels like there's a piece of one rule on page 5, 12 and 23 and if it's raining outside part of the rule might be on page 17 as well.  It feels that scattered.  Think...Runebound but maybe a little worse. It's very easy to forget about a rule because you're not guided through them very easily.  

-The need to check a plunder table based on a D6?  Give me a plunder dice with images that match what I can get instead.  Simplify this a little bit.  Quit making me check another table.

-Ship docked/undocked seems kind of retarded but I have only played a couple of scenarios so maybe it might make more sense later.  I do like the ship concept though for the most part.

-The playing mats from Ultrapro, particularly the layout mat, should be included.  I'm not saying as a padded mat, that'd be too expensive.  But do what Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon and other TCGs have done for new players.  Give us an little paper foldout that we can use for card placement.  Then that might encourage the purchasing of the mats as well.  

-10 Ultrapro sleeves?  That's it?  What the **** am I supposed to sleeve with 10 sleeves?  If you're trying to show me how cool the sleeves are, either just give me 1 or at least give me enough to sleeve a character deck or something.  What the heck?

Anyway, I know that seems like  a lof of griping and that I shouldn't give this as high as a rank as I did but I do really like the game as I get past the issues above.

Was originally hoping to swap Rise of the Runelords for this. Anyway, bought it as Griff and I had enjoyed playing Rise... allmost all the way through.
I got the character pack, as we wanted to play Damiel and Lini. Both characters had good access to healing, and Damiel can do well in multiple successive combats. We started initially with Seltyiel and Liryanne, but failed miserably. Finished the whole campaign with Damiel and Lini. Not sure how feasible the last parts of the campaign are with other characters.

Would love to trade the whole set for another edition, or perhaps something else (Gloomhaven comes to mind).

A nice deck builder with a quite sophisticated solo play option. No app needed. May be a bit too complicated for absolute deck building beginners. So if you want to draw someone's interest to that kind of games, you may should start with another game.

Unfortunately my (German) version of the game came with incorect printed dice (had two 2s on it :D) and the all around quality isn't overwhelming. Would be a 7 otherwise.

Simula bem uma partida de RPG sem mestre, mas tem alguns problemas: setup demorado, alta dependência de idioma e uma curva de aprendizado muito alta que afasta jogadores casuais. Ele é um bom jogo que te deixa sempre querendo ver as próximas aventuras, podia ter uma jogabilidade mais variada e não depender tanto de rolagens de dado. Um jogo legal!

I have played through the entire Adventure path solo with 2 parties (5 players and 4 players) and am finishing up a 3 player party.  I enjoy the character progression and feel that the game is more varied (in terms of scenarios and such) and more difficult (in a good way) than Rise of the Runelords.

That being said, and while acknowledging that Skull and Shackles should be the better game (in comparison to Rise of the Runelords), I feel that it falls short for me.  I'm not sure if it is a disconnect with the theme or that I don't love the way ships were utilized, but I don't LOVE S&S the way love RotR.  I still feel as though it is a very good game with a great system, but once I finish up my final party and run through the OP path once, I don't forsee myself coming back to it.  

Bear in mind though, that that is still a confirmed 3 playthroughs the published adventure path and going back to the the organized play path once, so....

Flip a card from the top of a location deck and use the cards in your hand to work out how many dice you get to roll to beat the number printed on the location card. Far, far too much randomness. Very little planning required, far too much reading of cards and working out maths.
I'd rather be playing Magic.

My friend's daughter got this as her free Geekway game and wanted to play it, so I taught it as best I could based on my previous experience with the original Pathfinder ACG set. This one has ships in it and the rulebook is godawful so I couldn't figure out what, if anything, it did. We mostly ignored it. I got the gist of the game across and they seemed to enjoy it. To me it seemed like more of the same, with boats, which I really liked when I first encountered it but cooled on quickly.

Gameplay:
+ simple, but solid system
+ fast game play
+ co-op with high player interaction
+ campaign over at least 30 different scenarios
+ character development throughout the entire campaign. level-ups and looting
+ more challenging and more varied than the previous campaign "rise of the runelords"

- the new ships feel forced upon the game. they add new fiddly rules, which are not really elegant and they don't improve the game enough to justify the fiddly rules. they are quite disappointing actually.

Components:
+ the cards are of high quality
+ the box comes with an inlay to sort all the different cards

- the artwork is not as good as for example The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game
- if you sleeve your cards they do not fit well in the inlay

Fun game. I love the idea of the Pathfinder ACG, but I have some issues with it. Progression feels too slow and spread across plays that starts to feel repetitive. The ships don't feel like they add anything fun, just more rules. In the end, I feel the investment of shuffling no less than 13 decks (monster, barrier, weapon, spell, armor, item, ally, blessing, 4-8 location, and 1-6 character) for each play isn't worth the fun the game offers for someone who plays mostly solo. If I had a dedicated group interested in playing, I'm sure this would be a blast -- it would offer a great mini-RPG experience with no DM required. The decisions about the items in our deck would be much more personal as we would have a greater connection with our characters, and we could share the effort of all that shuffling.

I expected to like this game, but I just didn't find it very engaging.

I love the concept, but found my first game boring.

They broke our favorite game. We loved the first version (Rise of the Runelords) and bought all the expansions, despite the very poor quality components. With this version, they changed things up just enough to break the game. We aren't enjoying this one. And the quality is somehow even worse than the first one. I had to request a replacement deck of cards because they were printed so badly and the replacement deck was not much better. We won't be sticking with this one.

Early thoughts (Prior to reading rules or playing the game):

The artwork and overall presentation is a heck of a lot better than I had been expecting.

Given the price I can't help but think the dice should be a little more so.

This said the sleeves are a major improvement.

Slightly worried that the gameplay and story will be clunky and disjointed.

This is a flawed game with a maddening business model. It is incremental deck optimization in super slow motion that requires another $20 purchase after every 5 games. Despite the Pathfinder window dressing you have to work hard to feel a sense of adventure. And despite the co-op nature there aren't many ways you can actually work with other players when it is their turn.

However, this is the game my son and I have played the most together, by far. I can't help but give it an 8. Well played Paizo. (Plus, in all fairness, the game gets more interesting once you start getting to adventure deck 3-ish)

More of the same, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it. I like the additions, small though they may be, and the new characters feel very exciting across the board. Some of the quests are quite creative in the way they manipulate a limited number of resources to create a different experience. However, the side-effect of those manipulations is the occasional adventure that feels far too reliant on either luck or a specific character. Doesn't happen often, but it's enough to leave a bad taste in the mouth.

I didn't realise how attached we'd become to our characters' styles of play in Rise of the Runelords until we started this campaign. It felt quite awkward at first, but I think it was the unfamiliarity of the characters and not a problem with the game. We all struggled for a while to get our heads around the rules for ships, but now we've done that, the game feels smoother than Rise of the Runelords.

RATING: 5
So far, having just played the base set, I am finding S&S to not have the narrative pull of RotRL.  It is still enjoyable, and I do plan on working my way through the adventure path.  It's just that the plunder mechanic seems like an obvious attempt to let players see more cards, the ship mechanic is cumbersome, and the narrative linkage of cards and locations isn't quite as tight as I would like it to be.  There have been some fun moments - Valeros taking out several crab swarms with a boarding pike (the visual in my imagination is great); Damiel insanely burning things to the ground; and Lini assuming the roll of captain with her eye patch and collection of animal allies (crew).  But I imagine that as I found in the RotRL, these fun asides will have to be replaced with more strategic card gathering.  Still, the game has so far given me about 20 - 30 hours fun solitaire play, so no major complaints, really.

Edit: Have played through the first Adventure deck, and I have to say...it was boring.  I'd give is a 4 or 5 rating.  I am playing Lini, Valeros and Damiel, and there just weren't any fun moments.  You know, something quirky that happens in a thematic way that provides a memorable hook.  I haven't come across that many cards, either, that excite me as far as making my characters more...thematic or cool.  Anyway, I'm thinking back over the experience and trying to recall cool moments...pain in the ass moments, sure, like scenario 1.6 where you have to recharge your hand every time you take on a pirate trait, or scenario 1.4(1.5??) where you have to give up an ally at the start... etc.  Pain in the ass that didn't become more than that because they didn't connect with the locations and encountered cards in any meaningful way.

We still not finished all adventure decks but this game give me very similar experience with TRPG pathfinder in easier setup and smaller required space. I usually run 3 game saves for 3 group of people with 3 different group size (group of 2, 3, 4) and this game scale perfectly fine for us. There will be really downtime on the adventure deck 2 but after that the difficulty and excitement go real high. Very enjoy it.

"Fantasy-themed card game which shines as a lengthy campaign. The added variability over RotR is nice, but the added complexity and swingyness is not. We loved RotR, but abandoned our S&S campaign in the middle of box 4."

What I like:
- Seeing a character progress over 35+ sessions
- Clever slow-deck-build system, where cards = hit points
- S&S adds several interesting twists

What I don't like:
- Several scenarios are annoyingly capricious (2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 3.5)
- Other scenarios are just brutal (4.2)
- Several scenarios feel like you are just jumping through hoops for no purpose
- There is a bit more to track than I prefer
- The ship mechanism doesn't feel very smooth
- Some of the text is REALLY small (notably the skill used for each check, which matters more in S&S than in RotR)

Rise of the Runelords was a big hit for us, and I was in 2 campaigns spanning over 70 games. Skull & Shackles is more varied, but less fun. Too many things shuffle back into location decks. Too many monsters cause you to discard or bury cards off your deck (potentially causing death), or do massive damage before you act. One card can cause you to instantly lose the entire scenario if you fail to defeat it. They could have achieved variety in other ways.

When the first Adventure Path of the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game, Rise of the Runelords, came out, it didn't grab me at first.  It seemed like there were a lot of forced restrictions on the players and character growth.  A friend of mine was very much into it, though, and asked me to play through the campaign with him.  

We played one scenario a week on average, for a few months.  Over that time, I grew to appreciate the subtle complexity of the game, and the decisions that it forced upon the players.  Furthermore, I was able to appreciate the themes that the cards and mechanics evoked.

Still, it wasn't perfect.  There were a lot of useless cards, and oftentimes the scenarios were a walk in the park.  Characters became vastly more powerful than the enemies they faced from about the midpoint of the campaign on.  We even walked through the last scenario with no challenge whatsoever.  

Skull & Shackles, however, takes everything I loved about the Runelords game and steps up the difficulty to the point where players need to always be on their toes.  No longer can a group recklessly explore several times in a turn.  Every turn has the potential to be very dangerous, and I love that.  Couple that with the theme of pirates sailing around in ships and acquiring plunder, and you have a great new entry in the series. 

The reason it gets an 8 from me is because the theme doesn't appeal to me as much, and a lot of the difficulty increase feels forced. It's still a solid game, though.

More of the same and a bit harder (especially the first base Scenario (Island Hopping)), although if you're playing S&S you're probably more skilled.

RATING: 6
Loved (and completed) Rise of the Runelords, so I had high hopes for this set.  Must say...kind of unimpressed.  The new set is harder (the first adventure in particular seems really off the charts), and the new "Ship" rules add a splash of flavor and a whole shipload (heh heh)of added game time.  A bit of a letdown, if I'm being honest.  The box and insert are also slightly lower quality (no doubt a cost-saving measure).  
Probably going to ride this subscription out, but this'll likely be my last PACG unless some big innovations that deliver on the initial promise of a persistent world show up.  

Edit 2015:  Totally over it.

Sept. 2015:  Son and I bought this one to play after trying out a friends copy of the original game.  This one is fun and all that, but for Pirate adventure I'd rather play Rum & Bones.  Card play like Skull & Shackles just doesn't seem to translate to great adventures for me.  Maybe it's my lack of D&D background.

10.3.14 got this on a great sale. owned the original game and loved it. On first pass I gave this a 6.4. While I liked the system, it seemed the new "theme" added some confusing overhead to the game.

10.4.14 After 4 more plays I am upping my score a full point to 7.4 (not quite an 8). All the fluff, while adding some complexity to the system, really help to make each scenario different from the others. They give a feel which can really change how you approach each game and the cards that fit best into your deck.

RATING: 6
I recommend this game over Runelords. Other than the ship mechanics (which are easy to learn if you can learn PACG), the mechanics are the same. However, thematically, I think  S&S works better than Runelords. Frex, in Runelords, you can find an arcane tome and soldier at the old barn. Huh? Why? How did they get there? And how did you acquire the tome? Did the farmer just give it to you? Why didn't you pay him a huge hunk of gold for it? Thematically, the cards and mechanics were disjointed.

However, for S&S, the theme is implemented better. While a cutlass fits the theme (and is an unusual item for an adventure boardgame), it's not uncommon enough on a pirate location that you didn't just buy one in town with your everyday funds, or find it washed ashore with a body on a pirate island. Likewise, the allies are mostly crew members, so you recruited them from town, they're already part of your crew but can now do some exploring, or they were castaway on a location and want to join you.

Update: Repetitive gameplay.

Bardzo dobry karciany kooperacyjny RPG. Podczas rozgrywek przechodzimy swoją postacią kolejne scenariusze, zdobywamy nowy ekwipunek, sprzymierzeńców, poznajemy nowe czary, uczymy się nowych umiejętności bądź doskonalimy te już posiadane. Fajna mechanika w której ilość kart w decku (a jest ich standardowo 15) wyznacza naszą ilość życia, zmusza nas do odpowiedniego planowania kolejnych posunięć i skrupulatnego zarządzania kartami w ręku. Co prawda większość scenariuszy ogranicza się do zwykłego "znajdź bossa i go pokonaj", ale sam rozwój postaci i możliwość zrzycia się z nią jest dość unikatowy i daje wyjątkowo dużo frajdy.

Despite my excitement over a solo-playable DM-less game version of the Pathfinder RPG, I decided to pass on the original PACG: Rise of the Runelords series because of lackluster reviews. But when Skull & Shackles was available at a really good discount, I figured why not give it a try. So I got it along with the next couple of Adv.Decks with it and trying to play through it now. I don't disagree with all the complaints, but take it for what it is, and can be a light-weight, fun dice chucker game with the satisfaction of leveling up your character.

Very enjoyable but setup and packing away can take a while. Due to this it doesn't get to the table as often as it should. The ships feel a little tacked on but the overall games play is better than Rise of the Runelords. If you're on the shelf about these games, try the digital version.

What a great game. I have never been one to play RPGs so when I heard about this game and how it mixed rpg into a card game, I said it's  not for me. Then this set came out and me and my brother just thought pirates yes let's give it a try. Well it took us about three days to actually understand what all the dice do the card feats and how to even play. But once we got it down, wow just wow. I love this game and may now actually give RPGs a chance.

More of the same from RotR.  I was hoping they would learn some lessons from designing the first adventure path and add some more lore/backstory, scenario variety, etc, but they don't seem to.  The new ship mechanics, 12 scenarios in, still have yet to really add anything to the game aside from fiddlyness.

I do love the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game system but working our way toward 50 plays now this next set is a wee bit disappointing because they are really just giving us more of the same.  I love the system so much that I still consider this a great game but I really do wish they gave us more to change up our experience.

Really the only difference this time around is the inclusion of ships and plunder.  Now players have a list of ships they can command on an adventure.  The ships each have their own special ability and you can acquire plunder in different ways which give the players extra rewards at game end.

Honestly, not only are the ship rules the only real new addition but they aren't even well done in my opinion.  It makes a little bit of sense when the ship is anchored during an adventure because then only players at the anchored ship's location can pilot it at the start of their turn.  But when a ship isn't anchored any player at any location is piloting the ship on their turn.  This makes no thematic sense and also makes things like cards that play off of you being on a ship kind of meaningless when you are basically always on a ship.  And in our experience so far a ship is not anchored more often than it is.

In the end though I still love this game system and now we have all new...everything to play with so it does give it a fresh new feel.  My favorite new addition is the Alchemist character.  We steered clear of potions for the most part in Rise of the Runelords because nobody wants a one-time use item in a game like this.  The Alchemist doesn't have to banish these cards and becomes an awesome jack-of-all-trades character.  Unfortunately my wife beat me to the character before I could snatch him up for myself.

I will also point out that the game feels tougher this go around.  We have lost once already and won two by the absolute skin of our teeth all in adventure path 0.  Toward mid-to-late campaign in Rise of Runelords the game definitely felt too easy so this is a plus.

A good translation of traditional RPG mechanics into card game format, complete with character progression.  Can be played solo, and that's fun, but it really shines with more players in co-op mode.  Because of the 'Pathfinder Society' adventure paths that have been released this game sees more play than any other in my collection - we have regular weekly sessions with a group of 5-6 players.  I'm not so keen on the pirate theme for this set - it's interesting but sometimes feels a bit forced.  I'm looking forward to 'Wrath of the Righteous' which will return to a more traditional setting.

Like Rise of the Runelords, I wouldn't recommend buying this game without buying some expansions, but with the expansions, it's a blast to play. It's virtually the same game as Rise of the Runelords, but with a Pirate theme, but there are enough differences that I really enjoy this one too. I actually enjoy S&S more than ROTRL because of more varied skills required to accomplish tasks.

Just like Rise of the Runelords, Skull & Shackles really does deliver the Pathfinder RPG element. With new classes to become, and more enemies to conquer, this Set really does match the hype it received. The new Ships and Plunder system is a great addition to the original game, allowing for the party to receive more rewards as well as utilize the Blessings Deck to aid them. The party really enjoys this set more than the original.

Received in a trade. I'll open with a rating of 6 until further notice. I would not have traded for it if I felt I would rate it lower.
Very "Pirates of the Caribbean." I was not sure if a pirate theme would resonate with me but its proving to be really fun.
My daughter is excited to join in!
Seems like a pretty steep learning curve so far.  I play some, then get bogged down with a rule application.  I'm sure I will figure it out.

Good about the game: Theme feels really good.
Not good about the game: Rumor has it that the dice rolling gets really tiresome but I tend to like games like this where you earn the right to dice bonuses before rolling. I've also heard that the "ship" mechanic is a bit fiddly or confusing, but I have yet to see for myself.

Very surprised I like it so much (rating might go up).
Gives me a lot of "choose your own adventure book" feels (which I loved growing up). Must be played as a campaign as the "in between games" deck building is almost as fun as the scenarios themselves

[+] love the "deck building" aspect during the campaign, love the hand management at the core of the gameplay (I prefer characters that cycle there cards like oracle and bard), the first leg ot the campaign offers a good variety of scenarios, still have the first exp to play.
[-] a bit swingy even with all the objects that give more dices, I was able to fail at a scenario on the last roll on an easy 6-check despite rolling 4D6 (rolled 1-1-1-2); the giant box is fine to store everything but hard to fit on the shelves... It's very costly to get all the expansions, I'm not sure 5 scenarios are worth 20€... setup is on the long side (populating the decks...)

UP: played the first avdenture deck, and it was uneven; the first scenario is a bad joke: only 1 location, super easy, a waste of time. the other scenarii are standard; new location/banes/boons are good, but nothing groundbreaking. I decided it won't be worth buying more, for what it offers, it's too expensive.

I'll try coming up with custom adventure decks, reusing the same cards, see if it's fun or not.

Pirate expansions to adventure games tend to be mediocre ([url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/13081/runebound-island-dread]Isle of Dread[/url]) or just plain bad ([url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/55150/descent-sea-blood]Sea of Blood[/url]), so it's nice that Skull and Shackles rose up to embrace my mild expectations.

A surprise to no one, S&S is a lot like the original, but different.  It's more for the sake of moreness, and no doubt will end up under the Christmas tree this winter.  My kids love the ever-evolving character decks, the photo finishes, and the quality time around our dining room table.  And for the record, my kids are barely even kids anymore - now well into their teens.

So sure, I'll fork out another $40 for cabin boys, sharks, and kelp-encrusted monsters with mermaids in tow. How can I avoid it, given that Pathfinder has become one of my most-played games of all time and the only card game in history that I wish I'd sleeved?

Honestly, a hearty adventure in 75 minutes just can't be beat.

Although many Pathfinder fans would disagree, I much prefer the seafaring/pirate theme of Skull & Shackles over the traditional fantasy locale.  I also find the challenges in this game to be more varied and difficult over P:RotR.

Were it not for the tedious setup, this would definitely hit the table more often.  This is one of the few exceptions where I greatly prefer the electronic implementation over the physical medium.

Mechanically, we liked this a little more than RotR. The difficulty was increased a bit. The pirate theme was fun, but in the end the whole ship mechanic didn't end up being quite as exciting as anticipated. Still can't argue receiving extra gear cards at the end of a scenario, though!

I was wary of this game based on what I read, but figured I would try it out in light of the high ratings and good ratings.  Very luck based and few strategic or tactical decisions - mostly just flip a card over and roll one or more dice.  If there was supposed to be a story from the locations and cards, it was paper thin.  Similarly, it did not matter whether you were in combat or attempting a barrier, it felt the same.  Didn't make sense to have to roll to acquire a weapon or armor.  Felt like Runebound, but without a map and more annoying because your possessions disappeared after use.

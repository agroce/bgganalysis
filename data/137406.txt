WTF?  Thieving monks getting treasures from the docks and hiding them around a monastery so the Abbot can find them.  Seriously.  Is this the best theme Queen could possibly come-up with?  Thematically, I found this concept bizarre and quite distracting.  Gameplay was frustrating - with everyone holding identical cards, you would often find your plans foiled because someone else chose that same action, forcing you to hurriedly re-think options or just slow down decisions.  Multiply this for everyone and you have a game with lots of unnecessary downtime and a weird theme.  Glad I played it, just don't ask me to play it again.

Uninspired euro with yet another middle ages theme which in this case doesn't make much sense. Why would rings on the same table have to be of the same type? I'm still unclear what our meeples actually represent. Maybe the earlier version's gardening theme worked better?

*6* (Initial plays)
A standard pick up and deliver game. The sound of stashing treasure appeals to me, and thats likely the most entertaining part of the game, but the game was a little disappointing. The card play is a bit frustrating because a player is limited to what others have not played. There also was a big sense of repetitive play in the game. Something I would play if in the right mood but I wouldn't expect my rating to get any higher.

Friday 13th is coming and we need to hide our treasures. Thanksto our great friends at the local monastery we can hide it from the king there.
The card mechanism is in my opinion pretty cool, especially since two players can't play the same cards in the same round. The game also contsins a little bit of backstabbing this way, especially since some cards prevent players from taking points when they need them.

I Kickstarted this game!

Played with 5 players. While the game itself is ok, it is just not something worth playing regularly (or at all). 

There was significant downtime for each player between moves, and while they made and effort with the artwork, telling the cards apart (in terms of which players have played what) was difficult.

Players help the Knights Templar to get their treasures to a secret abbey and hide them inside. Each player can use the different members of the abbey to help them hide the treasures – but every character is different and needs to be used wisely. Whoever hides the most treasures wins!

The game end looms much earlier than anticipated. There are 2 fundamental strategies: stockpile your treasures into a few rooms and have the abbot score them or scatter your treasures in as many rooms as possible to collect on the end game scoring.  There is no time to do both.

Underwhelmed. Quite long for what it is, and we only played with three. Some nice gameplay, but mostly optimal decisions and little interaction beyond certain timing or blocking moves. The final game seemed less than the sum of its parts and it felt slightly like a few wrong moves early on blighted your chances to catch up. If anything, Regimus moves too slowly.

Area control game. Doesn't seem to be a lot of flexibility on strategies. Because end scoring is automatic for rings all else is pointless because you can't count on it scoring and it's to easy to work against the scoring mechanic.

I don't know why this game has such a low rating. My only thought is that there can be frustration with the unique character card rule. (If someone else uses that character, you cannot.) I have found myself frustrated in five player games with not being able to do what I wanted to do. (This frustration is reduced with fewer players.) Even so, this is intentional game design and there is strategy in this. Outside of that, it is a very solid, balanced, fun game our game group had enjoyed playing.

RATING: 6
There is nothing very wrong with the game and I had a good time every time I played it, but there is nothing very exciting, either. The core idea of each player having the same character cards, but being prohibited to play a card identical to one on the top of any opponent's discard pile, is very nice. However, the actions are a bit dull. You have ten cards, but, most of the time, you want to get treasures, place them in rooms and score them, playing other cards usually when you can't do any of those. The restriction on the placement of rings might have been an interesting aspect, but it is poorly implemented, with too many areas, and rarely comes into play. Also, the theme makes less sense than the original one of planting gardens. All in all, it's a pretty decent game, but it lacks that quality that could make it a keeper.

Played at Spiel'13.

Oh well... one of the worst games I've played lately. The game isn't good, nor does it offer anything new at all. It's a boring and (with more players) chaotic game without any depths, even though the game tries to look it had any.

I just can't find anything that I like in this game.

Was really interested in this game when I first saw it.  Then I saw mediocre reviews and was kind of wondering if my instincts were wrong.  Got it in a trade and was excited to give it a go.  Actually, the entire family enjoyed it, but am unsure it we will be asking to play it regularly.  It will see at least a few more plays before we decide if it will be replayed often enough to keep.

2013-12-13: Played a couple of 2p games. The first felt very open and it was pretty clear we weren't effectively using the strategies available. Counted it as a learning game. The second game was very tight, lots of conflict and planning. Much better the second time around. I think it shines with more than 2, but it is quite good for 2 as well.

2013-12-08: Punched and played at last with a group of 4. Very tight game, lots of fun. Not good for those AP-prone players or for the less strategic players. Still, our group picked up the rules fairly quickly and everyone enjoyed themselves. Looking forward to a 2p game soon.

Kickstarted. Not terribly pleased with doing a Queen kickstarter, but this game looked fairly underloved so I pledged. 

Note for future reference: Queen doesn't believe in individual ship notifications on Kickstarter and lumps a lot of campaigns together at once in updates. Annoying. Backers using MyUPS to track packages had better info.

A lot of downtime in a 5 player game and some annoying rules (eg in addition I not being able to play the same as a face up card, also lose a point [when difficult to see cards from across the table]!). 

Gameplay was pretty pedestrian overall, and ponderous in points so insufficient to justify a 2 hour initial game (although would go quicker with fewer than 5 players). A few different ways to score points, but not sure all of them are really viable strategies (although this may depend on on how a particular group plays).  Overall: a lightish game with uninspired theme that takes longer than it should.

---- Preliminary thoughts ---- 	
Palacio de Viana rethemed. Although the theme is completely artificial, the gameplay feels totally abstract.

2 player games and 4-5 player games will feel totally different because of the "Don't play others cards" rule.

The interaction allow all players to gang vs the leader :-S

Not for me.

RATING: 7
A rather simple pickup-and-delivery system with interesting timing considerations in the card play. Somewhat repetitive, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Templar is an evocative theme obscured by abstract gameplay that makes almost zero thematic sense. It uses the Castles For All Seasons design - everyone has an identical hand, play a card that no one else has played since your last turn, play your retrieval card to get them back. The restriction means the game continually slows up when your favoured options are denied you and you need to cast around for another ok card to play, trying to work out what other people will do this round to have a feel for what you might be able to do next round. Basically, you have to get out of sync with the other players. The cards allow you to retrieve treasures into your stock, or move around the board to place the treasures in rooms, or move characters around to score a room of placed treasures. Given everyone's got identical decks, you want to get into as many room partnerships as possible so that other players will score for you. And cut down the number of actions you're not retrieving / placing treasures. Although the decision tree was ok in the parsing, the abstract theme-less nature, the slow pace and the implied kingmaking all unfortunately gave me little other pleasure in the playing.

One of the better Queen Games, but in the more family games section. It's not as 'difficult' as a Lancaster or an Edo. Question is if it will appeal the through family gamer? My first play was at Spiel 2013 with 3 players who clearly weren't used to playing 'the alternative' boardgames before and they true this was a very difficult game. The taking back cards and how to time this (a mechanism I personally like a lot) was something very hard for them to master. 

Note after 2nd play: 5 players is just too many as most of the meaningful cards will be constantly blocked.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a fun game with an inherently enjoyable mechanic of running your meeple around and hiding treasures in rooms, and then moving the scoring meeple around and turning the rooms into points for everyone with stuff in that room. This is done through a card selection mechanic where you are blocked from playing a card that someone has at the top of their discard pile. This locks the available actions and forces people to reset their hands. There's a lot to like with this game, but ultimately you just feel very boxed in.

I picked this up in tandem with the Anniversary Edition of Alhambra on one of Queen's Kickstarters. It's an okay game with some cool ideas, but it just swings too wildly from strategy to chaos the more players you add. It's also a bit too complex compared the lighter fare that I usually get from Queen games.

Very interesting game where players are looking to place items in rooms to score, which feels very different from most games where you are trying to collect things to score points.  The game also has a unusual way in which you play your action cards, the only problem is that you must be able to see what your opponents have played all around the table and for some reason they decided to use small or normal size print.  Not smart and very annoying.  There are some ways to get around this by using custom tokens, but still it could have been avoided by simply using large print.

RATING: 3.4
Playing with 5 is massively too many. Perhaps with three this would be less tedious. With 5 players, you sit and do nothing while everyone works out which of 9 (or so) cards they can't play, then they work out which are useful and then... Zzzzz. You can't plan much until your turn because you don't know if the card you want to play will be blocked by someone else playing it. On far too many turns people felt like they had little to no choice about which card to play which is a real problem after that much downtime.

The actions themselves are pretty uninteresting; collect some bits, place some bits, score some bits, move some unscored bits. Repeat.

Templar really felt deeply uninteresting. 

I've often stayed away from Kickstarter games because they feel underdeveloped. It seems that Queen might have been infected with the Kickstarter stink based on this years offerings.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
One of Queen's most visually striking productions is also one of it's least satisfying.  Templar is a loose affair of movement and cardplay with minimal conflict.  The theme is a bizarre interpretation of the mechanisms.  Templar is too rulesy for an afternoon storybook experience, and the result is all artwork, no thrust.

An interesting, fairly light game, with a few timing and scoring mechanisms. Getting Maria early is an advantages. We fell into an anti-pattern where Bells followed Maria around the table that was guaranteed to hurt whoever broke from it first which was disappointing. 

There wasn't really enough reason to choose many different characters once that pattern was established. Disappointing. It also ran quite a bit too long with 4.

Not played, 
Templar is (apparently) a reimplementation of Palacio de Viana, which I have had on my watchlist for a long time. So long in fact, that I couldn't exactly reminder how it got on there.

But a quick search provided me with a basic description of the game, the fact that Bruno Faidutti talked about it, and I found the mechanic that caught my eye:

Quote:
The main mechanics of the game is then the use of the cards, one per turn, covering the one used in the previous turn. But it is due to the principal rule of the game that this mechanism gets really interesting: you cannot play a card that is in play by another player in that moment. 

So, the rules have been posted, and it seems they indeed took the card play mechanic and built a different game with it. Seems okay.

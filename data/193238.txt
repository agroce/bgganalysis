Similar to the original game.  A bit challenging to figure out what you need to do at the start.

OCS. Beautifully upgraded Map. Really like this game.

Probably the best introductory OCS game - the race for Tunis scenario is tense, exciting, and very open.  Multiple axes of attack, multiple options and a full toy box of units to play with.

This is my fourth attempt at OCS and each time I pull it out hoping for a great experience I end up shelving it as a disappointment. The concept is great, components and map all good, but the rules to me are poorly written. Time after time I find loose or poorly written rules open to interpretation. It seems that OCS has a small dedicated group of followers that have grown up with the system, have seen the rules evolve, and know the reasons behind the section and can therefore make an interpretation. But for someone just learning the system, these holes just lead to confusion. Maybe if you have an experienced player to teach you ftf it's a good system to get into. But if not, you may just end up beating your head against the wall.

In terms of artwork, map and components, this looks vastly better than the original from 1995 (which is my least favourite OCS game in those areas).

The game itself has been modified in what seem to be relatively minor ways:  changes to some units' Action Ratings; consolidation of multiple small artillery units into large group artillery units; adding some garrison style units in places; subtracting others.

The concept of surge planes is also introduced to Tunisia, as are factional replacements.  All in all I am enjoying the new Tunisia as much or more as I enjoyed the original.

Just got this last night. Played a couple of scenarios. I'm impressed, I think OCS suits this theatre. Not massive counter density but not small either.

Components are nice. Design fits in with the overall OCS brand.

Really great OCS title, the smaller scenarios work well as introductions to the OCS system. Will almost surely play the campaign game in this one at some point.

I bought this in yet another attempt to get to grips with the OCS. Made it through the Race for Tunis scenario, playing solo - well, gave up halfway through December when it was clear the Allies were never going to hit their objectives). No doubt I've made many terrible mistakes, but I've really enjoyed the experience. The relatively slow build up of forces in the first few turns makes this an ideal place to start. 
Map and components are lovely, and the rules reasonably clear (plus you can always get lots of help here on the BGG forums). I'm really looking forward to giving this another go! My rating probably reflects my lack of experience - I bet this game is much better once you get the rules down and can really see all the possibilities it offers. May rerate later.

Allied ground superiority is established very early on, but soon the Axis start to achieve parity in terms of numbers until Montgomery and his 8th Army arrive. Luckily, there are only a limited number of mountain passes in the centre and careful garrisoning can stall the Allied advance.

To the south is the large open area suited for armoured combat. There are only three Axis supply sources: Tunis, Bizerte, and Sousse. (Sousse was added in the 2nd Edition.) All other ports must use shipping capacity and supply points to sustain troops, which means any Axis forces down south will very quickly be cutâ€“off from a trace supply source. However, if the Allies spread their forces thin, the Axis can use their AR 5 Tank Bn and Tiger Tank Coy to pulverise individual Allied units out in the open, which should buy some time.

The Battle for Tunisia was basically a glorified holding action for the Axis, followed by another holding action in Sicily, before making their stand in mainland Italy. They can however make some devastating counterattacks using their AR 5 units against lone Allied units with ARs of 2 or 3, especially with their tank battalions and Tiger companies out in clear terrain. One shouldn't underestimate the Italians, whilst they have many terrible units some units (e.g. Superga Division) are actually alright and can cause major damage in the right place.

One thing this wargame doesn't get right about the Tunisian Campaign is the sheer volume of supplies received by the Axis player. In reality Allied bombing of Axis shipping capacity was severely limiting Axis attacks and counterattacks, yet in this game there's almost no effect.

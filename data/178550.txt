It delivers what was expected: it's a better Risk. And that's what I wanted! It doesn't play terribly fast with 5+ players at the table - the final round (or perhaps two) are quite filled with turns for all players. But due to the turn deck, you don't generally have to wait too long for any single turn. The special cards are often enough a decisive factor - but not to the point of unbalancing the game. And dice rolling obviously has an impact. Still, over all, if you want Risk but better - this is a very good bet. I like it.

I purchased this game through the Kickstarter campaign. I'll admit, I am friends with the creator but I wouldn't give this game a good rating if I didn't enjoy it. I play lots of table top games (Pandemic, Ticket to Ride, Dominion) and am a big fan of Wil Wheaton's show TableTop on Youtube, so I would have tried Spheres of Influence even if I didn't know the creator. I was worried that I wouldn't like it since I normally don't care for global domination-type games (Risk, Axis & Allies) I find them too long and more frustrating than fun. However, this game was fast paced, and very engaging. There was significant strategy involved, and there are added elements (regional resources, oil production, and capital cities) that make the strategy a lot more interesting than just battling your opponents. I played with 5 people--a mix of people who like global domination games and a couple who don't. Everyone really enjoyed it. Took about an hour to complete. Good quality game components.

Quite a fun beer and dice game. I like the random turn element. Monitoring the status board (or whatever it's called) as you conquer realms is a bit of a hassle but not gamebreaking. I enjoyed this one but I wouldn't buy it because I have better war games knocking around. It's a billion times better than Risk or anything of that ilk.

UPDATE: I have changed my rating of this game based on the addition of house rules that reduce the frequency that cards are awarded.

-------------

With minor modifications, this game would easily be one of my favorites.  I have played this game about four times, and unfortunately the outcome of each of the last three has been determined by card play.  I realize that gaining cards is an important part of the game.  However, in my opinion, the significance of the cards (and luck of the draw) shouldn't overshadow good strategy as easily as this game allows.  Future plays of this game will be played with some house rules to reduce/minimize the impact of the cards.

This game will replace RISK for me and, possibly, the Game of Thrones board game.  Think of a RISK like game with some added, interesting and unique (in a good way), mechanics that can accommodate up to eight players. 

Take a RISK board and add in sea routes (with movement way-points).  Players get only ONE starting territory, the rest the map is empty.  There are a couple 'resources' scattered about the map that provide certain advantages and scoring.  You make movement only ONE territory at a time, moving however many pieces you want from that territory to one other, so it's a fairly fast moving round.  Turns, which you can gain more of each (independent of each other), are taken by drawing cards from a shuffled pile of player color cards (you add in as many cards as you get turns based on your territory/resource ownership).  This makes turns within a round randomly spaced apart.  So you don't know exactly when you'll get to take your turns within that round, adding a sense of uncertainty and suspense to the prospect of conflicts.  There are also some cards that can be used (if you can get any) to impact certain situations.

Learning the rules only takes a few minutes.

The extremely well run Kickstarter was enough to grab my attention.  The comparisons to Risk and Axis&Allies speak to me, but honestly I see this game as an elegantly streamlined version of Supremacy.  

The unique game turn / card mechanic helps keep the game moving at a brisk pace with an unpredictable pattern of action-taking.  I particularly like how the overall game moves at a brisk pace for the first 4 rounds or so, and then expands into a true strategic thinker for the final rounds.

So far, our games have not had a "runaway leader" that could not be stopped in the last round.  Despite this, you really get a sense that your strategic decisions matter.

I backed this game on Kickstarter as it looked like an interesting strategy game and have really enjoyed playing it. 
The game is not without flaws, but they are minor and don't detract from the overall experience.
Gameplay is fast-paced and is constantly building toward the final turns.

A good successor to Risk even though I hate that game.

It is a much more pleasant game to play, quick and more strategic options are available. You also have special cards like in the game Ultimatum, which adds spice. :)

I would not buy it. I have much better games in my library that have the same feel and have more depth. But I strongly suggest it to any Risk fan... especially if this game is like 35$ or less.

Very enjoyable light war game.  Loved all the cards you could get, none of which were too overpowered. Plenty of strategy involved. Great balance: when you do well and expand quickly, you become vulnerable to attack. Combat wasn't too random, but just random enough. Very good, will defo play again and pick up a copy if I can find one.

Blends beautifully mechanics from RISK and Axis & Allies to create this refreshing Area Control Wargame Experience with lot's of tactical choices involved that scales well from 2 to 8 players and will want you to play again and again.Definitely a gem to every boardgamers collection.
Only problem is that the game is extremely difficult to find as the Company behind this sells only in USA and in limited numbers.

Fun game. Fast playing. Has worked well with both 3 and 7 players. Looking forward to official expansion with faction abilities. I don't even want to say, "Like Risk, but better" because some people might be led to think the experience is similar to that of Risk. It isn't. The mechanics are very different; the map is superior in every way, the strategic choices given are much more interesting.

Great Dudes-On-A-Map improvement over Risk.  Some cool mechanics and a reasonable play time makes this a fun choice for various player counts when you just feel like conquering stuff.  Kingmaking always rears it's ugly head in this style of game.  Biggest weasel/politician generally wins.

Combat dice mechanics uninspiring...results fall in a very tight range which dampens the drama.

This game is awesome! I busted it out this past holiday season and my family loves it. We have always resorted to  Risk for our long strategic games in the past when the extended family got together over the holidays.  But no more!

The things I love about this game are: The random turn order, the "special" cards (can't remember the name), usually everyone has a chance to win until the end.  It also seems balanced really well.

Takes the basic world domination through dice rolling concept of Risk, takes out all the crappy bits, and adds a bunch of cool new stuff to liven it up.  Cards are fun as are faction abilities, the dice rules make for more interesting combat, there's nowhere to hide and turtle on the map, and there's a definite round-count end to each game so you never have interminable games like Risk.  Fantastic game that deserves wider distribution.

Garbage game, risk is better.  The design is based around a massive snowball army production that favours a runaway leader. It attempts to counter balance this by making attacking horribly imbalanced in favour of the defender. End result is that the game is basically determined when starting locations are decided. Factions that have more adjacent open territories are given the advantage that cannot be taken away from them.

This Kickstarter game is a clever Risk variant that will play up to 8 but is almost certainly better with 2 to 4, as that allows for each player to control two or more factions. It solves rather well the main shortcomings of Risk. Of particular appeal is the way the game deals with turn order and the number of actions that each player can take. Relating this to oil production is a nod to Glen Drover's Attack! Expansion.

RATING: 8.5
The top contender to outright replace Risk. Why anyone would want to waste their time playing Risk anymore when they could be playing a streamlined and updated version called Spheres of Influence I have no idea. The plastic cubes are a million times better than wood pieces and work perfectly with the game. This plays up to eight players and yet is engaging the entire time. Game time is about double what is on the box but this does not detract from the enjoyment. I can see myself playing this many more times in the future. If you are looking for something to replace Risk or outright hate Risk than this is you game, buy it today.

Pros:
* Cards add a nice element of surprise to the game.
* Far superior combat system compared to Risk.
* Plastic cubes are a million times better than wood.

Cons:
* Keeping track of everyone's progress can be tedious.
* The zoomed number bubble for some area values on the board is slightly confusing, as people may think it is a separate area.
* Does not include a plastic nuke token.

6.5 - it's an alright game, but I think the things it tried to fix about risk are things I liked about risk. The invasion mechanics are pretty cool and the turn order is neat, but only getting one action means you can fall behind early and not be able to catch up.  The regions being worth different point values fixes the broken europe/asia problems, but introduces the new problems of CONSTANT bookkeeping.

Coming here from the kickstarter update. First, I just want to say that apart from your update explaining how to use Board Game Geeks. I wouldn't even have an account or know how to use this site.

I also want to say good job on the campaign. This is probably the one KS I backed that actually showed up on time. 

Now as far as the game goes I want to say a couple of things:
1. Components: very nice quality board and cards. I would have preferred wooden cubes, and the progress sheet is probably a little too small if there are alot of factions. Also, I would have preferred maybe some tokens for tracking spaces that have been nuked, or spaces that are start locations. This is the only thing that keeps the game from having a 10 in my mind.
2. Mechanics - The turn system is probably one of the best turn systems I've seen in a game. The battle mechanics work really good too - its got enough going on that you can make intelligent decisions, but not so much that its slow or cumbersome. I also though some of the small things worked well too - like how unit placement order works. 
3. Complexity - My friends are basically half very casual (stuff like Catan), and half pretty avid gamers (Descent, D&D, Game of Thrones). That said, this game is simple enough that so far my casual friends can play but has enough going on that my gamer friends aren't bored. This is a very big deal for me. Also, the setup time is really short, and the teaching the game is pretty quick - it usually takes me about 10 minutes to teach.
4. Fun - I can say that my friends and I have had a lot of fun playing this. So far we've been playing it probably 1-2 times a week, and we haven't got bored yet.

An excellent game in the genre, with some unique play mechanics that keep things moving. Unlike some games with turn limits, SoI always seems to end at just the right time, leaving you satisfied with the outcome but without having to deal with mopping up the stragglers.

This game is fun for both casual gamers (as much as that can be said of anyone) and hard-core strategists.

Solid game. Not really Risk like - the turn order system makes it markedly different. I have seen this mechanism in other games and it was this that sold it to me. 
First couple of turns are really quick as you will not control enough oil wells to allow many actions. After that, it slows down a bit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This game is quick to learn and quick to play.  You do not get bogged down into stockpiling like in risk which makes it much more enjoyable.  The time of 90mins for a game is accurate when you have played it before.  However it also can scale up to play with extra faction and increase the game time and intensity of the game.
The game includes special cards which really make combat interesting and it effects strategy for expansion as you can go after extra cards, extra oil for more turns or production to boost reinforcements.  
The combat system is simple but effective, I really like the way both sides can get kills in the same combat round rather than I score more than you so you die.
The designer is also very involved in the community in developing ideas for new cards and expansion etc which is very good to see.
If you like Risk, this game is just better plain and simple.

Designed as a Risk killer, and it succeeds well here.

Pros:
- Good quality parts.
- Easy to learn.
- Good game play, pace, and replayability.
- Special cards add the right amount of randomness/variation.

Cons (both minor):
- Keeping the progress chart updated is tedious and error prone.
- The "+n" indicator on the faction cards is confusing at first, because it's the number of bonus cards on top of the 2 base cards, but the progress chart lists total turns, not bonuses. For example, a player has 5 turns according to the progress chart, which means the "+3" is added to the turn deck. It would be simpler to number the cards, so the number 5 card would be added to the deck when the player has 5 turns.

Sigh...six people.  Way too long with six.  I can be talked into one with four again, and will probably need to play at least once more for final commentary.  As it stands, however, the bidding got on my nerves and it felt like the game just went on and on and on.
We'll see if playing with fewer makes me enjoy it better.

Too bad that you need more than two players to play this, because it's usually only us two. Interesting concept, though I think that I'd rather play [thing=68182][/thing] than this one again, just because the theme is nicer there.

RATING: 6
Pretty artwork and an interesting idea that the amount you bid for a card also determines how long you keep it.  The magic powers are reasonably varied.  I've only played with five and six players.  With these numbers the game drags on far too long, is repetitive, and fine judgments about how much to bid for gems seem absent.

Hoewel Kathy het moeilijk had om de regels goed uit te leggen, zijn ze eigenlijk niet moeilijk en straightforward.

- Kaarten kopen
- Kaarten gebruiken (alle metalen, grijs, rood, blauw)
- Biedingen in x aantal locaties
- Energie afgeven

Two auctions one for cards that give metal income and powers that are loaded up with the currency you spend and the other using different metals for gems.  Vulnerable to run away leaders or losers and wont be fun for all.....but I liked it and really like the mechanic for the first part though it is vulnerable to rich get richer as if you win a great card you get to have it longer.

Innovative auction game. The higher you bid the longer you can use the special abilities. But you lock up your resources at the same time. Those who say it is unbalanced just don´t know how to value the cards.

This game does NOT play well with 3. That said...

I love this game! It's pretty and the way the strength of your powers are tied to the amount you bid is so sweet. It seems a perfect game with 5. If someone gets just the right combination of cards, it's tough for a few go arounds but it gets remedied eventually. I'm kicking around the idea of not starting with any powers at all (or maybe one) rather than the written rule of two with the option of replacing one or both.

My copy has paste-ups on my cards which increases the enjoyment of this game even more than I thought possible while we were slogging through the printed translations.

Very BALANCED game : it&#039;s about auctions on special cards which break the rules of jewels auctions. 

NOT A KINGMAKER GAME : you can react against players who dominate by choosing the right place to bid for jewels (you can have plenty cards and can&#039;t be able to use them, and you can have few of them and by good management win some auctions)

JUST BE CAREFUL WITH THE GREAT COMBOS the players can combine

Highly Recommended for players and poker/auction/magic theme fans

I love this game. Still fun but can be random. Good strategic choices and an excellent bidding game as well. I'm not sure I have ever won yet I enjoy every minute of it. The wheels always seem to come off my game plan. I finish one game and look forward to what I'm going to try in the next game. I try not to make the same mistakes but somewhere I suspect it's in the bidding I seem to go astray. Please read the full reviews somewhere and do yourself a favor and at least try this.

The game tends to be dominated by major turns by people as their respective suns rise and set, based primarily on the spells which are present.  The link between various resources being variably useful in the auctions is a good idea, but adds to the chaos of the game probably.  Good idea, but pretty darn random when it's all said and done.

Much lighter than I thought it would be which was a pleasant surprise. It's a light game but there's a lot to like here. That you use your "money" to boost your cards and that they deteriorate over time so you get your money back is cool and makes card balancing a moot problem as it will disappear after some turns anyway. And if you spent too much on it you can't afford other cards.

Not a game I'd request perhaps but still fun to play. The German text on the magic cards is not a problem as the iconography is quite clear anyway.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The players are wizards who bid energy stones for spells. The bid stones go onto the spell card effectively making that spell available for that many turns. The spells generate metals and it is the metals that are used to gain the gems needed for the Amulet. First to fill their Amulet wins. Some nice ideas, but ultimately feels rather clunky and mechanical.

Too many different things to do.....each card breaks the basic rules in some way and it's just too complex for what you get!

[1 play] Pretty enjoyable.  I like the mechanism of how the spell cards work--a constant stock of power chiclets that you use to power your spells, and as the spells burn them off you get them back into your bidding stock.  
The only thing I did not like so much was the endgame, which definitely had some kingmaking potential (on the part of the player who had had the short end of the stick throughout and was in dead last place, which was also not great).  The end was such that you could see what was going to happen, couldn't avert it, but had to spend a few turns playing it out.  
I would certainly try this again if the opportunity arose, and it would be interesting to play with more players (we had 4).

RATING: 6
I find the spell casting mechanism, in which players place tokens on the spell cards to determine how long they will last, ingenious.  The rest of the game, unfortunately, doesn't quite measure up to that mechanism.

This auction game has both its biggest strength and weakness in the same spot: the magic system. The basic idea will look familiar to seasoned train gamers. At the beginning of a turn some magic spells are auctioned off. Players bid for them with energy, and the winning bid gets placed on the spell. From now on the spell will consume some amount of energy each turn until it's all used up at which point it fizzles.

The weakness comes about due to vastly different levels of usefulness of the spells. It is not necessarily unbalancing because very powerful spells abound, but if you do end up with a weak set or one player manages to build a great combination (and neither is an event you can plan for) that is pretty much the end of it.

RATING: 3
My main issue with this game is the auction of the spell cards (which generate income for you; the metal cards).
As every player starts with the same amount of magical resources (aka the money you pay for spell cards), the first player offering a card estimates it's value and if he decides to take it for himself he makes a bet that no one can overbid. The second player does the same. The last player thus has no choice, either he buys a useless card or nothing. (this is not compensated for the next auction as during the upkeep players will get back their used resources). This leads to very frustrating moments due to how your seated around the table: keyword randomness. Without income your out of the game! This mechanism may work with casual gamers, but avid players turn this design weakness to a nearly broken game.

I read the rules, I looked at the bits, I thought this is going to rock!  After three turns the guy that happened to draw nice income earning spells lorded it over the other two of us and the game was over.  The spells that allow you to gain an extra gem when in certain territories (or even if not, there is one that just lets you have an extra gem) is really really powerful.  I walked away from that game thinking "did we play something wrong?"  Perhaps it's a better game with a lot of people.  I will not play this again.

This could have been Moon’s best game EXCEPT for one kind of big thing, some of the cards and some of the combos just get too strong and can create runaway leaders.  It reminds me of a boiled down Zepter (though I have not played, just from what I know).  

A very stripped down auction game with fairly low luck actually, surprisingly for a Moon game for sure (and it could be slightly lowered by flipping ALL cards to be auctioned at start of auction so people know what is up for grabs, not sure if this will be an improvement though, could help someone too much?).  Essentially players are bidding on special spell cards which give them some special power typically and again typically generate “metal” cards.  Once everyone collects the metal that they have coming to them, now a new auction round begins to bid on jewels, first person to get 7 different or any combo of 8 jewels  wins the game, that is really it in a nutshell so its raw and that part of the game is great.  

As I mentioned there is more than one card that by itself is likely too powerful, and some of them should likely even scale to the number of players.  One in particular, Greed I think the name is, lets a player take a metal card EVERY time there is an auction that has 4 or less cards in total bid, that is usually going to be WAY Too many free cards.  There are also some very  lethal combos that come up and depending on the timing (that is where luck can come in, which cards come up and when) players may not be able to stop someone from combining a deadly combo, which in turn generates them more metal which gives them more jewels hence you can see a runaway leader here.  If everyone is carefully watching AND the timing works out hopefully combos can be minimized but I think a few certain cards might need to be weakened a little.  

Not sure if that is why this game never made it to the main stream but for 2001 it was a decent auction game with VERY low rules overhead.   It could be a tad long for what it is or with 5 or 6 definitely too long which is easily fixed by lowering the jewel count to win.   

Auctions for the all powerful spells are once around only and money (energy) is very limited and open info so you have limited control on how to prevent combos, timing is key and luck unfortunately.

Das Amulett was more fun on my first play than I expected. I’m not sure though how much players really can influence. The right spell card turning up at the right time can help a player big time without any chance to plan or prepare for it. As it’s comparably short (less than one hour with four players), the partly chaotic nature introduced by the spell cards might be acceptable once the novelty factor wears off.

Great bidding/auction game done in a cleaver way. Only change for # of players is spell cards auctioned off. Since each player only has 10 power stones each, bidding higher for a spell means locking yourself into that spell longer and having less stones for future bids. Having this a once-around auction with the start player moving to the winner works well. Some spell cards are certainly more powerful than others but none seem to be too unbalanced. Be careful of some powerful combos however. The gem bidding is classic resource management and keeping track of which players are collecting certain metals. Plays relatively quickly and also plays up to 6 (although that may be a little too chaotic.

Double auction game in which you first purchase spell cards which allow you to both break game rules AND inform you what metal cards you can collect which are then used in the next phase for the gem auctions.  I really liked the spell auction which creates tension between using spell chits to buy more spells while having to consider how often you might want to use them since it locks up those spell stones in future rounds for spell bidding.

I'm someone who generally doesn't care for auction games, but this one I like. Maybe it's due to the large number of auctions (can lose some and still progress), or the Magic The Gathering influenced spells (especially in combos).

My single play of this game is the PERFECT example of why I shouldn't play games when I'm not in the mood:  I get cranky, I only half-listen to the rules and I walk away never wanting to play that game again.

It has a great mechanic which is the saving grace of the game. That being the bidding of tokens for cards being the tokens you get to put on the card to power the card up.

Otherwise it's bland & rewards the player that can churn / manipulate cards better than their opponents.

Fun little auction game. The mechanic of spending your limited supply of stones to buy and then power your spells is clever.

RATING: 6.5
Neat auction game -- I like the "auction within auction" concept and how the price you pay for the spells makes them last longer (or not). However this is a doubled-edged sword; you'll pay higher for a good spell, and it will make it stay longer on the board! Meaning that the players who purchase the really good spells will have  a strong position for a longer period of time... weird. Not a huge fan of the setup, the spells you get at the beginning can have a huge influence on the outcome of the game. Why not just bid for them??

Got this in the sales bin at the FLGS, was recommended to me and I like the fantasy theme.  The gameplay is fun, relatively fast and there is lots of opportunity for tactics, plus I like bidding games, plus it stays tight until the end.  The components are very nice on top, so overal very good game.

Quite some cards with quite some text, so if you're allergic to language dependent components (and they're in german), steer clear...

Interesting game where one puts bid tokens on spell cards and that dictates how long one has that spell. Use collected commodities (from spell cards) to bid on gems, winner being the first to reach a number of gems. It seems that whoever races off with the first couple of gems (either through the double gem spell or clever manipulation of where the bidding takes place) has an advantage. Neat ideas, perhaps if there was a better way to seed the starting cards (make them more equal) the game would be more fair. Some interesting spell combinations can be set up, and game is interesting in that respect.

RATING: 7
Played once.  Interesting game that would benefit a lot from repeated plays, due to the need for familiarity with the many spell cards in order to play well.  In this respect, it's very similar to M:tG.  Although the components are up to the usual high standards found in German games, I don't care much for the board artwork or components; that's a minor quibble, though.  I would like to play it again sometime.

RATING: 6
A game where the auctions are crucial to doing well, as they generate the resources you need to win the stones. The auctions are once around, and your bid dictates how long the win effects will be in place for, so bidding exactly right to get the right combination is important. Especially as everyone has a fixed amount to bid with so you're only likely to win 1 item a turn on average. If you misjudge what the later bids will be, and no good new things come out, your game can crumble in a heap. Or if you bid on something of slight interest to get the price up and accidently win leaving you with not enough for the remainder of the auctions. With only limited rounds, it's very difficult to get back into the game if one of two auctions go wrong. So, it's a very unforgiving game with a challenging mechanism.

Very fun auction game. The cards are pretty straightforward so ones german language skills will not be overly taxed.

Sure some cards seems a bit unbalanced (nota bene I've only played two games with three players), but it's relatively fast and engaging and furthermore, if one player succeeds in building a killer combo, well, more power to him/her.

Scratches nicely that very hard too reach spot right between euro auction and ameri powerz.

RATING: 2
Very nice components but feels very much like a filler.  The power of the spells can change the game wildly. As the spells allow the players to 'break the rules' it fits in the same group as Cosmic Encounter or Citadels. Unfortunately, the spells are not well balanced; some are simply too strong while others have no value. The mechanics are nice but as a whole it fails.No real strategy is possible due to the imbalance. Simply doesn't work well.  There are much better auction games around.

I wish I knew why I didn't like this more than I do.  It's got some M:tG-like card combo elements, and an interesting auction mechanic, but the whole experience seems to be lacking something.  Nevertheless, I'd be willing to give it more plays, to figure out if I'm not being fair.

Couldn't wait for F2F version so I got German editions and did pasteups for the cards. Looks like a great game.

Update: A dual layered auction game. Players use a fixed pool of energy stones to bid on Spells. The stones determine how long these spells last. The spells in turn give special abilities as well as metals needed to bid for Jewels. The first player to win enough jewels to complete the Amulet wins!

Mechanics mesh together well but as some have noted, there are wild card combos including one that saw one player get 6 or 7 needed jewels in the FIRST TURN! Further plays needed to cement rating.

The plumage is lovely and it's a smart game.

There was a time that it seemed that all games that were coming out were auction games.  This is yet another one of those games.  Only, it's quite good.

The two big selling points for this game is that it had geography before Goa did, and that the magic system is individual and works really well.  There is some minor luck of the draw and turn order frustration, but that is all a part of the fun.

After a second visit to the land of das Amulett, I have warmed a slight bit to this game.  I am sure being tied for leadership during much of the game influenced my view quite a bit.  I found that it is very useful to have the cards that allow the winner of an auction to gain 2 jewels and I was very fortunate to have such a card along with the cards that allowed for a discount during auction of 2 and 1 respectively. I was only able to make use of all three of these cards during one round, but picked up 5 jewels in that one round.

RATING: 6
An interesting bidding game. You have 2 currencies, one of which (stones) you use to bid on and power your spells, and the other (metals) you use to bid on gems from the board. The first to collect 7 different gems, or any 8 gems, wins the game. Early mistakes, however, can make the rest of the game painful/boring! Everyone also needs to play close attention to the spells in order to prevent someone from getting too powerful a combination.

A hard game to really put my arms around for some reason-I found it difficult to keep track of everything going on.  Auction style games are my favorite, so my rating is essentially a lukewarm endorsement.  In fact, my buddy suggested it the other night and I turned it down.  Probably do need to try it again to really get a better feel for it.

Nice enough offering by Moon & Weisblum (where is he nowadays?) that was eclipsed by superior games that were published around the same time (ie San Marco and Capitol). Gameplay is decent, although I suspect that going for lots of metals (rather than special abilities) is the way to go. Vohwinkel went over the top here, as the artwork is hideous.

A 2-level wizardy auction game: bid for spells (& their longevity) then visit board regions bidding metal cards for jewels. First to 7 jewels wins. First play for all three of us, and we probably weren't too alert to spell powers. One player got a couple of powerful spells and ran away with it. How much of that is down to our inexperience and how much down to unbalanced spells may never be tested further.

Looking forward to the English-language version of this game. I've enjoyed playing this seveal times, but there's just enough text on the cards that playing the German editon has detracted from the flow and flavor of the game.

I really wanted to like this game, by all rights it seems like something I should like. Magic? check. Set collection? check. special powers? check.

Even though it's a game from 2001, it is based around a mechanic that still feels fresh and original in the year 2010: When bidding on spells, your bid determines the duration of the spell's effect (possibly spanning several turns). There are some great combinations possible with the spells, so careful bidding is required to make sure that the spells are active at the same time. Despite the fact that the game still offers a novel experience, it is a bit too long for its own good (2 hours of bidding is a bit much) and there is a risk that it all ends in a kingmaking situation. In addition to that, I deduct half a point for the really ugly boards and beads. It must be one of the ugliest boards I have ever seen, almost making me feel ashamed when I bring it to the table!

Comments after half a game. I liked it. Collect the 4 types of metal cards which are used in the auctions for areas to collect gems. You can only bid the one type of metal in each area. Each player also has 10 spell bidding tokens that are used to bid on the spells. The more you bid the longer the spell is in play. At the end of each turn one or more spell bidding tokens are returned from each spell. Use your spells and metal cards to win auctions and collect gems.

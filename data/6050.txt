Update: Got all expansions and the base game for like 20 bucks at the GASPcon auction. Had a really good time playing with Jonathan, really want to play it more.

Traded Ticket to Ride for this.  [update] What a great trade!  My brother and I both really like this game, and he is hard to please.  Having a meaty non abstract two player game goes a long way, and the theme of this one is up both of our alleys.  Each expansion seems to add exactly what is needed--more strange characters and items, as well as some more locations.  I'm guessing I will pick up 2 and 3 fairly soon.  The only downside is the platters are kind of warped, which is a noted problem--instead of trying to bend them back (I'm too nervous for that kind of thing), I bought a sheet of plexiglass to place over the platters, and that's worked out fine.  

Really enjoyed this game--would love to play it more.

RATING: 6
A game that attempts to be everything.  Surprisingly it mostly succeeds.  At its core it's a two player tactical war game.  But each unit is a unique character and can be further customized during the game by collecting special equipment.  But victory is dependent on completing missions, so there's an adventure element to the game as well.  Strategy and tactics co-exist with camp and craziness.

Some of the more war gamey elements interfere the the flow of the game, particularly the combat resolution table, line of site rules and the ever annoying opprotunity fire.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good AT/tactical wargame cross over, but an awkward system (from a wargame perspective) makes it difficult to explain to both wargamers and Ameritrashers. I think I am beyond the phase of light thematic wargames so it is no longer a great favorite of mine. Might change once I play the expansions (which I've heard add a fair bit).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Weird game.  Didn't have a great experience my first time playing, but it seems boring and repetitive.  I love the theme, as this game is oozing with it, but in practicality you just try to get into labyrinths, roll a few dice to randomly resolve challenges that are all the same, and then repeat until the time is up.  Where's the fun?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I can't get enough of this game and I hope I can play it over and over again.  Decent components but they need a little modding (white and black unit stands) to increase playability.  I love the variety of equipment and character cards.  It's "The Savage Curtain" meets "Quantum Leap" in a holographic combat arena.

Great game. Always have a blast playing this. Can get very chaotic, can be unbalanced and there's a lot of luck, but this game doesn't aspire to the euro game checklists... it's just a crazy contest between random teams.

RATING: 7
Very fun theme.  Solid game.  You got to laugh and love it when Sir Gawain charges into battle with a machine gun only to die in melee combat against a Civil War soldier wielding a broadsword.  It's quirky; it's fun, and best of all, it works.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Lots of potential again.  Got all the expansions so I'll add more as I play.


Game play is a bit clunky 
(color stat - dice scheme that is similar to warhammer)
(random decks of items, characters, adventures, etc that don't seemed too balanced)
(somewhat hard to keep track of everything).

and the cardboard is a bit weak.


But using some heroscape mini's helps bring the theme through which in the end is enough to make this game worth playing.

RATING: 7
2009 - Superb, crazed multi age combat across fields of battle with adventure, war-game and fever dream elements. Reasonably simple system, except in Opp Fire.

A lot of elements to earn but the effort is ultimately rewarding

2017 - Not being played much any more. I think mainly this is down to my lack of patience for sorting the bits out, and just generally playing with people who expect something different than dice chucking fun. I still appreciate and like this game, but it's clear I've fallen out of love.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
A very fun game I consider to be in the 'Heroscape universe'.  You control a character who could be from the ancient past, colonial, modern, or future times.  Your goal is to cooperate with a group of adventurers against an opposing group to complete challenges.  You also attempt to kill the enemy with items you pick up from various points in time.  Some crazy situations occur, which make the game pretty funny at times, such as "Ghengis Khan riding a mountain bike shooting a plasma cannon."

I am embarassed to say, I own this game but I have never actually played it.  I rarely play games with my family, and the game club I am a member of is not quite interested in playing(a few exceptions, but overall, it is probably not going to happen).  It looks like a lot of fun.  Can not wait to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A little finicky for my tastes.  The available characters are not equally balanced in play, the components are cheap (what's up with the tile warping?  Did they not test this before they shipped?) and the game play confusing at best.  I could play it again, but with all the other better games out there, why?

Nice roleplay-like game, with characters trying to make plans against opposing team in ever-changing situation. Also the theme of bringing heroes from ancient and future ages on the same battleground is fascinating. Only problem is that bad luck with the dice can totally ruin your game..
Perhaps suffers a bit from the same thing as Munchkin-like games: reading cards is funnier than playing.

Good concept, art looks good, a lot of money for all the sets. Perhaps I&#039;ll have to cave and just get the first couple instead. There is also a Collector&#039;s Case coming out I think, where you can stash the whole set; it comes with extra goodies too. According to the forum on duelofages.com there has been some slight warping of the platters, so either bend &#039;em or wait for a second printing? The only thing now is to get enough people together to make it interesting!

It's okay.  The mechanics are fine, and it's pretty playable, it's just not all that interesting.  Move, roll dice, hope to draw good cards, watch as opponent draws SIGNIFICANTLY better cards and starts annihilating you, sigh.

It probably could create some very fun matchups though, so I would still play it if asked.

Was excited to play this when I saw it at the top of Tom Vasel's Top 100. This game is an abomination. Complete lack of any sort of strategic thinking in here. You'd hope it would make up for the lack of strategy by at least having some exciting action, but instead it's just sitting around moving towards wherever silly location you're trying to reach while ignoring your opponent. What a boring, worthless game. But, uh...you should totally trade something to me for it; I'm sure you'll love it!

I love this game but I hit a point in my life that being married is taking a lot of my time.  It's really hard for me to pull this game out as it takes 3 hours.

Update: 
My wife is not a big fan of the game, so it isn't hitting the table at all.  She finds all the combos too much which is the best seller for me.  :(

Jan-31-2009 Update:
As my tastes matured and figured out what I really like in games, this just doesn't cut it.  I used to like it a lot, but exposure from better games certainly affected my desire to play this game.  Too much dice rolling, chits are too small, needed to come up with ways to keep track of hp, too long, too much luck, etc.

My favorite game, bar none.  I will _always_ play this game.  This rating is for the entire game with all expansions.  The only reason I did not give it a 10 is the components.  I would like to see larger hexes and counters or even miniatures.  Then it would be a 10 for me.  DOA is my favorite game although I don't get to play it very often.  I've upgraded the counters with foam tessel tiles.

Fast, fun, exciting tactical game with some role-playing elements, some wargaming mechanics, some  CCG-like aspects and even cooperative-game elements not to mention a host of other very cool "stuff."

When you combine all that with infinite replayability,many interesting decisions each turn and just plain old FUN it is no suprise that this is my favorite game EVAR.

Hmm, I'm intrigued after half of a first game. It seems like a more sophisticated version of Heroscape, with less child attracting chrome and more strategy. While I'm not generally a fan of fantasy, it appears that I like these fantasy theme tactical combat games. I need to play more of this and see its depth.

Perhaps this game shines as a team game, but I have not enjoyed it much with 2 or 3 players. Traded it.

My group (RPG/CCG/German gamers primarily) got no flavor from this game at all.  Consequently, it was two hours wasted rolling 2d6 by general consensus.  It was hurt by the fact that combat involves TWO rolls - one to hit, and one to cause damage.  Traded.

First "real" play did not go well.  Definitely crowd and mood dependent.  This one is very dependent on enjoying the theme and mechanics can be a little on the dry side if you don't enjoy rolling dice and comparing different character/card ratings.

Optimal? = 2.1 to 2.5 characters per side per platter.

RATING: 2
Hmm..tried this one tonight, a 2 player game. 5 characters each, 4 tiles.  Uncertain.  We didn't have too much fun with the set-up, but thought that reducing the number of tiles or having more players controlling the same number of characters for larger teams would make it more fun, as well as familiarity with the system itself.

Obvious variant idea is making the items era-specific, either that a character can only get an item from their era, or the era of the guardian they defeat.

Very neat concept; but for such a theme-heavy game I wish the in-game story wasn't so bad.  The rules are pretty cumbersome, but most of the time they tend to be "common sense".  There needs to be a more definitive end-game, but I do love the way the victory points are calculated.

I am less inclined to come back to this it seems; it doesn't fit my gaming group that well and other games just seem to do the job better

I have played this game a few times and for some reason I can not get into it.  It seems a bit chaotic and I was often left frustrated with the dice roles.  This is not a game I would purchase but still a game I would play with friends.  I enjoyed playing this game as a team effort more than 1 vs 1.  As a team effort the fun factor shoots up the rating to 8.

RATING: 9
Solid 9 after three plays and *lots* of review reading. It takes a bit of work to get the components ready to play (the now infamous warped map boards and sub par die cutting on the counters), but once the preparation is done the components are very nice and the art (images and text) is amazing. I&#039;ll be figuring out some way to make the character counters more visible on the board and distinguishable by team. Game Play is a combination of light strategy and ever changing tactics. Please play with enough characters per team (8+) and for long enough to get into the grits of it (at least 2 hours).

I love this game and all the expansions, but I HATE the board artwork. It is too difficult to tell the difference between forest and swamp. The terrain on the non-ancient boards is too hard to interpret. If I had all the time in the world I would completely redo all my map boards, as they really hamper play. The rest of the artwork is pretty cruddy, too...some of the lamest 3D artwork out there...but it doesn't get in the way of game play. If this game had great art, I'd give it a 9!

This game has everything I want in a game. There is fighting, stats, equipment, tactics, and oozes with theme. However, I rarely find someone to play it with! But, considering it is so perfect for me, I just have to give it full points.

RATING: 7
A team kill or be killed game.  Relatively easy to pick up.  By accomplishing "quests", you get powerups (i.e. weapons).  

I like deeper games and this isn't one of them, however, this scored pretty high on my list despite it's low complexity.  Good replayability.  

Finally, for this game to really shine, you need the right group with the right amount of appreciation for silliness (e.g. Napolean attacks with chainsaw while riding a Sherman tank)

good game with very straight combat mechanics.
a great idea implemented by DoA is the 2-teams combat system that makes this playable by a very large number of people. You will often need more maps and more charachters to keep up the interest though...

Game with all expansion sets 1-7 and Scrye addon pack in very good condition. Includes new cards and tokens, as well as the update character cards from Master's Addendum.

Also includes a color printout of the Master's Addendum rules, and various player aids (the rest of the MA is not included - I just have the important bits - the character & equipment cards and counters).

The character cards are sleeved and each also contains the token(s) for that character. This really speeds setup!

Game will come in the original boxes for Sets 1-2. The other boxes are not included.

A single character token has been replaced with a homemade one. I made a color printout of the character icon and pasted it to a hex of cardboard taken from the frame from a map platter. It is nearly indistinguishable from the original counter.

Purchased Prestige pack as well

RATING: 7
I have played this (along with all the current expansions) several times with my gaming group.  It has strong team play, and can be played as both a light skirmish wargame and an object-based boardgame (usually both).  The cons:  even though it's a 'set your time limit' game, the play really doesn't start getting good until several hours in - so it's usually not rewarding as a quick evening game; also a bit fiddly (many things to keep track of) and takes up a lot of table.

RATING: 7
One of the better luck-based games I've played, primarily because it's varied and interesting.  The key to this game is its variety: variety in board positions, character draws, equipment draws, adventure draws, and opponent draws make this game highly entertaining and worthwhile.  While some may be annoyed with the different types of characters (etc.) when all you're doing is rolling dice, a player with any imagination at all will appreciate it.  One final note: this game has little strategy.  It is a tactics-based game, but the tactics are a nice sort of micro-tactics where mini-objectives can change from turn to turn, keeping players' attentions and sense of urgency nicely intact throughout the game.  Addicting fun!

Foremost impression - far too random with characters teleporting to various places on the board. I am mystified why this is Tom Vassal's #1, with his 1,000+ game collection. Lots of characters, with some humorous (but deadly) combinations. With the characters transporting around the map, it becomes too chaotic. I added the second expansion (Intensity) to add some variety to the game, but never got around to playing it. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
OK.  This is a good game.  I was worried; having tried to play it before and getting nowhere, I was beginning to think this game had been hugely overrated. It just needs the right players, since you can easily find yourselves overwhelmed by the various strengths and weaknesses of the characters in your teams.  I have to say, though, the rulebook is very poorly organised.  When you're first playing a game, you want to be able to find the various rules quickly, not flipping back and forth trying to make sense of it.

I really enjoy this game. Based on the few games I've played, one really needs to know all of the character abilities to really tap this games strategic depth.

RATING: 6
Great concept, bursting with theme, totally unique and varied gameplay, and a truly imaginative and fun experience all around. The combat rules are very clever, pitting different kinds of attack against different kinds of evasion to make battles a little more nuanced and lifelike. I also love that hitting a person does not guarantee damage but requires a penetration check first (after all, how could a blunt prehistoric club penetrate sophisticated body armor from the future?).

Unfortunately for me, the game is a little too long and a little too RPG-ey for my husband to want to play much. Alas, after mega bucks for the base set and all 7 expansions (plus mini-expansions!), I don't know how often I'll ever get it to the table. Too bad.

Boring combat game of running to spots on the board to hope to get useful items and then trying to kill off others running to the same spots.  Very limited tactics.  The color text is amusing and the mix of different time periods is interesting, but the staggering boring gameplay was not enough to save the game for me.  Only played with a few of the expansions, but they didn't help: same gamplay, just new items & characters.

Great idea that lacks greatly in execution -- it felt like we were each playing several simultaneous games of solitaire, as interaction on the board was rare.
DoA started out rather fun but each subsequent play dropped our interest considerably.

From the rules reading and explanation, I was expecting this to be a lot of fun!  However, after playing I realized it was only the idea of the game that turned out to be fun.  The game is too long and tedious for it's own good, and the fun factor wears out after the first 15 minutes.  It was also quite annoying that winning adventures, which is the main way you'll win games, comes down to a roll of 2d6.  In addition, it's a shame that they didn't print the platters on higher quality stock.  They're all warped, making the game a mess to play.  Lame.

Well, I've played two games with my 8-yr-old son on a trip to the cabin this week. We've corrected several errors made in my game group a couple of weeks ago when we tried it: used 4 and then 5 characters, included all the keys in the map (we misread the setup rules and used only two characters each and left out two of the keys at the game group--thus almost eliminating player interaction) and other things. Though it grinds a bit when played slowly (i.e. with an 8-yr-old), the adventures are fun and the interaction is too, and the skill-checking and battle systems, once learned, are intuitive. It's growing on me, and I'd really like to play it a few times with a group of grown-ups. But my 8-yr-old, despite the slowness of our play (though he fidgets during my turns) loves it and can't get enough.

Drawn in by the theme, what a disappointment.

If the thought of 2+ hours of choiceless, directionless "play" appeals to you then Duel of Ages is the game for you! There are literally no interesting decisions here. Walk toward pile of item cards, hope you draw a good item, throw some dice to hit some dudes and hope you roll well, rinse and repeat for two hours. Ugh.

Also: the art. Hahahahaha. Ha. Ha.

Initial playing was quite a bit of fun, but haven't replayed it yet.  Probably acquiring too many games too fast!  An interesting mix of RPG, wargame, and card game, with lots of flavor.  I could see younger kids liking this more than older kids.  Still, it didn't move me as much as something like "Runebound" or "Warhammer Quest", but I'm certainly not averse to trying it again!

RATING: 2.5
This game wants to be Heroscape so badly that it's physically painful. However, lacking physical miniatures or an interlocking board means that this game is impractical to play since everything is two-dimensional and prone to sliding around on the table with the slightest pressure. Additionally, the excellent theming is largely lost underneath the overcomplicated rules and piles upon piles of individual components - with so many different ideas expressed, none of the themes really have any room to stand out, so everything ends up blending together and getting really samey despite the strong theming.

I have a hard time imagining ever owning this game myself...but I would be willing to play it if another player brought it and pushed for it. I was disappointed with the warped platters, which we fiddled with in a few different ways for a while.  In the end, some plexiglass was the least bad option.

Maybe the comparisons are overdone...but I think I'd rather play Heroscape. Its lighter...but they're both very light, so what's the difference?

Whoa...I loved this after the first three plays (gave it an 8 at first) but then for some reason it just crashed for me...overwhelmingly repetitive, fiddly, and stupid.  This is the game you wanted to make when you were 12 years old...everything in the world slopped together into an incoherent, babbling mess without any finesse, elegance, or sophistication.  I initially liked the huge potential of matchups/equipment/etc. but soon I realized that the difference between a laser cannon and a derringer was nothing more than a different dice roll.  Terrible game, but could have been great.

Rated after 1.5 plays using the first set.  I immediately ordered the first essential expansion, plexiglass for the warped platters, and 1/2" wooden blocks to use as bases for the tiny counters.  My sense is that the score will increase a point when I implement the expansion and get a few more games going.  Converting my local group may be tough, as they prefer heavy euros.

I recently (12/1/06) played a short game with EventHorizon--three platters, six characters apiece.  This would be my third or fourth game.  I went out and bought the master's addendum afterwards for only $15.00.  I think that once I start playing this with my sons and corral a few gamers I am going to get a lot of use out of this game.  

There seem to be a lot of strategies that first timers never pick up.  This game should come with an instructional DVD and non-warped platters.  It would probably rank in the top 100 if that were the case.  Lately the game's site has been slowing down and I wonder if the company is going under or something.

I look forward to playing a game with 15 characters per side.  It would feel like an area control game, almost.  Also, this game is totally based on Riverworld, in my opinion.

(update: flexible magnets   hex nuts for the character bases)

Update 2, 3/5/2011: I haven't played this game in five years, but I refuse to sell it.

RATING: 6
Good racing/adventure/tactical battles game. Unfortunately the game needs at least the "Intensity" expansion to work properly, which makes the price steep. (Rating down by 1)I like the team play aspect and the variability of the characters. However, sometimes it can be a bit difficult to keep in mind the special abilities of some characters, especially when playing with/against several characters. You can set the size of the map, the number of characters and the length of the game at the beginning of the game. Also players can join or leave during the game in as long as at least one player per team remains. The flexibility is big plus! (Rating up by 1)

The game plays best with 2 or 4 players and 4-8 characters. More than 8 is difficult. More than 12 is nightmare.

In addition to Set 1, I have Set 2 "Intensity" and Masters Addendum. With these expansion I would rate the game 7.

Having been a boardgamer, wargamer, role-player, Magic the Gathering player for well over 30 years (starting with Avalon Hill&#039;s Blitzkrieg and working up all the way to ASL), I can wholeheartedly state that their is no finer boardgame in existence than Duel of Ages.

Playing 14 characters against 14 characters over 7 platters is a thrill unparalleled in my previous gaming experience ---- and
I&#039;ve had plenty of gaming thrills being the only 3 time winner of AH&#039;s Rail Baron at the World Boardgaming Championships held annually at Baltimore, MD. Also, at the same tournament, I was the GM for Kingmaker for 9 years.

So I&#039;m a heavy-duty gamer who has experienced the entire spectrum of gaming (except for miniatures), and there is nothing else out there that matches this game in excitement level, replay value, variability of tactical choices, artwork of the finest quality, an elegant combat system, opportunities for statistical rankings of unique &amp; sophisticated characters, and tons of equipment cards.

A great game to get your non-wargaming friends to play. The rules for movement and line of sight teach the basics of a lot of introductory war games. Characters are hard to spot on the board and stand-ups would be a welcome addition. The game does take a little while to play (5 hours), but several games have come right down to the wire, which shows good play balance. Duel of Ages does incorporate a lot of &#039;basics&#039; from other games I enjoy: Talisman, Squad Leader, and maybe a little Magic the Gathering. A recommended beer and pretzels. Can&#039;t wait to try set 2 for a little more variety...

This game is my first 10 rating, everytime i play i want to play more.  I know the semi - collectable aspect can be off putting, as the full set does require some expenditure, but this is one of the greatest games i've ever played.
Strategy in this game is very rich, every turn forces you to re-evaluate your position.  The sheer variation of play gives a massive replayability, your path to victory changes drastically every game depending on the team of characters you draw.
This rating is based on owning at least a couple of the expansions, and based on the
2 factors i consider most important for any game, a) how enjoyable it is to play b) replay value.

Feels like Unreal Tournament: The Board Game, but slower and without a lot of flavor. For all of the bajillzion expansions that was put out for this thing it doesn't really change much as each new adventure key is just a set of spaces to roll a skill test or discard some cards. There just isn't much there. The huge set of equipment becomes somewhat silly, and after a few rounds of laffs from killing a Unicorn carrying "really good sneakers" using a "Spanish field artillery" cannon it just becomes dull.

RATING: 7.5
Too early to give final verdict. I think this would reward repeated play, but it is difficult to get the time in these days... later... with the intensity expansion raised the overall game to an eight, but it rewards long sessions than can then get a kind of story arc to them. Is the sort of game I could imagine playing late into the night back at university, when I did that sort of thing. Good boardgame for rpg'ers or ex rpg'ers (who liked combat).

My most expensive impulse buy; bought set 1 to 7 because it just looked so good on the boxes. Played it twice and left it on the shelf for over a year. It just seemed strange. But! The Aha! experience came with a small paragraph in the Master's Addendum rulebook... How big a map to use with a certain number of characters. Suddenly everything just clicked. So much tension and fun. Perfect game to me, and it looks like DoA2 will be even better!

This is an entertaining game which really should have ignored the Guardians (which represent nothing but more die rolling)and just focused on the combat aspect.  Further, while the combat is fun and the time travel/sci-fi aspect is neat, sooner or later Ghengis Khan driving a mini-van and sporting an RPG gets a little old.  This game is pure filler.  And, except for the cards, the components are sub par (every battle grid I have seen has been warped).  I expect a lot more for $30.

After one play, I'm not convinced.  The whole thing feels too luck-based for as long as it seemed to take.  I like the idea of Duel of Ages... but the execution (our characters trudged sloooowly across the maps, failed to get stuff repeatedly, and once we did get guns, we shot at each other.)  
I know the stats would become second nature, but right now, I'm not sure it's worth the effort.

I played this game with all expansions, but sans the badges and cube cards.  I think this game is quite fascinating, but the complexity limits the amount of time I'll likely get to play it.

My rating will likely improve after more plays.  The visual aspect of the game is stunning!

One of the freshest games I have played in a while.  So much variety, so much replayability.  The time seems to fly by when I play this, and it always leaves me wanting to play more.  I seriously doubt any two games will ever develop similarly.  Even when not playing it is fun to read the myriad of items and characters to see what is out there.  This rating is based on playing with all of the material available, but I think it would be just as fun with the base game plus expansions 2, 3, and the master's addendum.

Impuslive ebay purchase of the entire set (all expansions) in Venatic's scratch-n-dent bundle sale. They're scratched and dented but I love the vast number of options this game presents. Very cool idea.

Finally got my first play in with a new game group. After getting the initial explanation down, play progressed smoothly with 2 teams controlling 8 characters each.

The greatest strength of this game is the ridiculous variety it offers. No 2 plays could possibly be the same. In addition, it screams out for someone to be recording the game play to later transcribe into a session report narrative/short story. Just as our play was halted [by being booted from the store at closing], Thump the ancient giant [known for his rock-heaving ability], was lined up to perform an op-fire drive-by from his bicycle with his AK-47. The image of it made me laugh through the whole ride home.

Yea, the game has its warts, but, all in all, it's ridiculously entertaining and, once one gets through a few rounds, the rules, which can seem ridiculously byzantine at first glance, come quickly and gameplay can run very smoothly. I dig this one. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
(This rating is for the entire set, rated together)
 
Wow!  This is a totally cool game.  In some ways, I liken it to Arkham Horror, in that there is a definite story being told.  It's also sort of like an RPG, where your characters have stats, run around having adventures, fighting monsters, and gaining treasure.  It's sort of like a wargame,'cause there's hexes, and you roll dice for combat, then check a CRT.  It has action, it has humor. So many things rolled up into a nice, tight package. What's not to like?  I also enjoy the idea of a time limit, rather than victory points.  You set your timer, and whoever is ahead at that time, wins.  I know I sound like a Tom Vassel shill, but I really love this game.  I can never play this enough!

 Bottom line - I traded Power Grid away to get this, and I am completely satisfied that I got the better deal. 'Nuff said.  This does not get to the table nearly often enough!
 
I think that you could get a cool short story out of a game, if you kept track of the action, turn by turn, then wrote the story from the point of view of one character.

I never get to play this, but I won't trade or sell it for anything!

After one playing I find myself not understanding the appeal of this game. I get a couple of characters that have a particular and rather complex set of strengths. I roll a dice and make some rather limited decisions about where my character moves. If I am particularly lucky I get to roll some more dice and knock the crap out of another player who happens to get in my way. 

Highly luck based and too convoluted for the degree of control that you seem to have over the direction of the game. I am willing to give it another run, but I am not optimistic that my view will change.

Intriguing game that is hard to categorize.  Players form up in teams and play one or more characters, which traverse a constructed hex map trying to eliminate opposition team members, as well as complete adventures in labyrinths.  Elements of tactical wargames involved in moving, spotting and firing.  Victory points are awarded for a majority of team members, and a lead on each of the four labyrinth adventure tracks.  Everything is run by die rolling against a "challenge number", which works very well and becomes intuitive after about 30 minutes.  Very strange game, and rather fun (if you think Ghengis Khan armed with a flamethrower driving a minivan is fun).  I guess it feels like "Unreal Tournament: The Boardgame".  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Nothing wrong with the game, but I found it really dull.  It seems like it should be a rollicking beer-and-pretzels game (due to the high levels of randomness with the card draws and die rolling) but there&#039;s just not enough happening at any one time.  Most of the turns are just spent running around to the few interesting spots on the map (a labyrinth, or an opponent&#039;s hex to beat up on him).  Perhaps if there were some sort of exploration aspect, or more card turnover (a la Wiz-War) it would have more appeal to me.

* This game generates exciting narrative like to other.  The characters' abilities and stats are remarkably well-tuned to the archetypes they represent and enforce the storytelling aspect of the game.  You can't help but picture each of these individuals and their actions in your head as the game plays.  This is much different from many similar games where the characters come off mainly as a collection of stats.
* Every set of characters is a puzzle to figure out.  The key to the game is figuring out how to best use your team against the opponent's team.  It is a race to match your strengths vs. their weaknesses.  Characters are just durable enough - they are hard to kill, but not too hard.
* Despite the many things that are going on and the high level of flavor that is maintained, the rules are quite streamlined.
* I love the challenge roll resolution table with color vs. color and the varying degrees of success and failure.
* Combat is just a means to an end.  Yes, you need to fight, but mainly you do so to further your ability to efficiently challenge the labyrinths.  There is a greater purpose to your combat tactics.  


I dig this game.  The biggest problem is that there is a LOT going on.  This is definitely a game that gets much better with familiarity, but you'll need to be a true gamegeek to break through.  This is the game that pushed my wife a little too far.
UPDATE: My wife tried it again, this time with 3 platters and 6 characters each, and she liked it (and, not coincidentally, she creamed me)!  
UPDATE UPDATE: The game offers so much tactical depth and variety that it has become a favorite.  Best setup: 3 platters, 8 characters, 2.5 hours.

Update July 2012: After a few nights of 3 platter games, we finally tried a four platter, 10 character game.  I thought that it would be cool to get in some more of the extra adventure keys.  The game went OK, but I think we really prefer the tighter experience of the 3 platter, 8 character setup.  Having more keys available didn't really add that much.  I think in the future we'll just use 3 platters and draw one of the extra adventure keys at random.

***Note: I produced this game...take the rating as such*** This game got me into the game industry. I am proud of the design work that went into it (art, story and mechanics). It has already become a solid addition to the board gaming community (in less than 4 months). The best thing I have to say about it is that it is a game that I can play with my 6 year old, my wife and with &#039;the guys&#039;...having a great time in each instance.

Need to play.

10/30/16: This has been in the collection far too long.  Every time I try to pull it out, I look at the ugly 1996 era computer graphics they used as artwork, as well as the ugly map and horrible graphic design just makes me say nope and throw it back on the shelf.  I've tried to read the rules, and that's a struggle too.  Far too much effort to get myself to play this game.  The idea sounded really cool, but I just don't have time for this crap anymore. Another game that taught me that Tom Vassal and I do not have the same tastes when it comes to his favorites.  See: Battleground Fantasy Warfare and Dungeon Twister, two of my other regrets from his reviews.

Clever game that scales very well from 2 players on up. Nice artwork and components, even if it all looks a bit too "CG-ish" to have a unique look and style. This games comes close to doing everything right. It has some well polished rules and good balancing mechanisms. I feel like I should rate it even higher, but I guess there's something about it that doesn't quite grab me... the theme (or lack thereof) maybe. The "deathmatch" element is good, and I don't mind the time travel aspect, so maybe it's the silly mix of characters. I also feel let down by the victory conditions: Get as many points as you can before the timer runs out. Still, overall there is a lot here that I like and I will certainly revisit it from time to time. I'd like to pick up some more platters for variety. Speaking of which, I don't mind the bent platters. Others tend to complain about them. We build our maps, then put them under a piece of thick plexi which fixes the platter problem and creates a nice smooth surface for pushing pieces.

This game came highly recommended by reviewers that usually fit my style. This is the first recommended game that disappointed me. It's extremely boring initially (why not put players into more action at the beginning). This set alone (i know nothing about other sets) it boils down to doing only a very few things. Walking to the adventure, fighting the guard, and/or fighting other players then poofing randomly to a dome. Repeat this process over and over.

During the game when someone asked me what they need to roll, I replied "Fun, because im not having any yet." We all had a good laugh.
So bashing aside, the game isnt for us and we are even a more "willing and active roleplayer" type group that doesnt roleplay (which oddly would seem the target this boardgame aims to capture).
No one in my group wanted to continue to play, but I forced them to until a few of us had equipment (maybe it would get more fun I told them) it didnt really, at least not enough to justify my purchase or the excellent reviews. Alas, the best things to do is always to play the game yourself, buy it, if you dont like it then you could resell it used. Thats what im doing, im sure someone would enjoy and love this game, its just not us.

Production quality and components are inferior to that of Return of the Heroes.

I have all the expansions of the original set.  If you have players who are willing to get into the goofiness of the game (for example, a knight with a flamethrower riding on a mountainbike) it's a lot of fun.  One of the strengths of the game is that you can play as long as you want.  Every time we've played, we've said "Let's play for __ hours"... and we've wound up extending the time, because we didn't want to stop.  That's high praise.

When a game tries to be everything at once and for everybody, it seldoms ends up being anything at all.  DoA is likely the product of the labor of love from gamers who hadn't found all that they liked in *one* game and tried to pack everything in there.  I can respect that, I often find myself contemplating doing just this.  But whenever you find yourself with a huge stack of components with countless combinations (maps, characters, items, etc.), broken situations often arise.  As far as I am concerned, DoA will always stand out as Exhibit B in the perpetual debate of the Euro vs American game philosophy.  Exhibit A are the thankfully defunct Eagle Games atrocities.
While I may play every now and then, this game doesn't grab in any particular way to get me to buy it and the umpteen expansions.

I've only had a couple of games, but so far this seems quite good. There are a few problems with the game, but it seems the expansions clear most of these up, so i may have to invest in a couple. The first time i played this, my sides hurt from laughter, it really does depend on who you play it with, i feel. Personally, this plays far better as a two palyer game than with multiple players on each team, it runs faster, smoother, and the players have more to do.

I was surprised at how good this game is.  I would never have bought it due to the horrible graphics (that some really like) and the weird theme (random guys coming together to kill each other). The dice mechanics are a turn off too, and the way the characters each have about a dozen stats and each stat as well as the die are color coded (most colors of the rainbow are represented), screams: avoid! It plays really well though. 

I'll always remember Sir Galahad being forced to navigate a minivan down a steep mountain pass without breaks. And Grog holding off Genghis Kahn and three others off at once. He was stalling for Sir Galahad who rode up and killed a few guys with his crossbow.

It combines tactical hex-based fighting with multiple objectives you can complete to win the game.  It's a team vs team game, which is fun, and the time limit is whatever you want it to be. It's not hard to learn either, all conflict involves opposed dice rolls and a single chart.  

I moved this from a 7 to a 6 because I would have to be in the right, chaotic, mood to play it. It's such a variable game, and navigating the four hexes can be such a chore, and rolling dice and using the lookup tables, that I prefer more elegant games usually.

For me this game has everything. Theme, outstanding variety/replay value, long term and short term strategy but with enough luck to keep it fun. It takes a few games to "get it", initially it seems maybe too random and its hard to make out the strategy. However I would only recommend this for 2-4 players, and while me and several others in my game group rates this a 10, some are not quite as enthusiastic.
I also highly recommend the 3 player "cutthroat" variant, this is my favorite way to play!

Alright, my rating has dropped for this.

Every time I play, I become incredibly invested in the game. And I don't mean in a good way. I crow over my victories and despair over my defeats. But neither of these is really fun. It just feels like the randomness of the game is kicking my butt, and ripping my heart around on a roller coaster of emotions.

I'm actually thinking about selling my full set now. And this has been one of my favorites for a long time. I just don't know if the time to play and the emotional fallout is worth it.

Duel of Ages is a fabulous game for the special moments it creates. My very first game I remember Spartacus storming into the Ancient Labyrinth only to meet Geronimo around the corner looking sly with a satchel bomb. I will never forget watching Geronimo blow Spartacus to kingdom come. 

However, there are some pitfalls here. So much of the game comes down to the fate of two dice. It will always be frustrating to watch your master melee character get cut down by some weakling that happens to roll several 'Amaze' dice rolls while your own 10 means you swung and missed. Argh. The tides turn, and things usually even out, but I find that this game often feels (and sometimes is) very one sided. I find that I have the most fun when I worry less about winning and more about doing something fun! While Duel of Ages does not supply the most balanced, strategic battle/futuristic game simulation, it does provide plenty of entertainment.

3/3 Increased score to reflect playing on 2 platters with 4-5 characters that get replaced when killed (variant).

In the early stages of a solo learning game. Holy crap this is a fun game. I have looked at this game for years and years and finally acquired it. Man did I miss the boat. Really looking forward to FTF play at some point.

People seem to either love this one or hate it.  I love it.  Contains elements of CCG (lots of character & equipment cards); RPG (this game creates an easy-to-imagine, fully-realized universe); and wargame (tons of strategy and tactics of the old-school Avalon Hill variety).  Supremely elegant d12/color coded system for combat and challenge rolls keep things simple and easy to remember after a play or two.  Sure, there's luck - but it's mitigated by the victory conditions (via combat success & fufillment of quests) and the need to customize one's strategy based on the team one's randomly dealt from game to game.  While the game advertises 2-16 players, it's really only fun with 2 (since there are only two teams possible).  When I do have three+ hours to kill, this is one I try to bring out.

Very good concept, but flawed execution.  Everyone starts "naked", and you need lady luck on your side in order to "pass" those labyrinth challenges, which will provide you with weapons, armor, transportation or the likes.

Cards are nice, but the all important boards are not flat.  Requires the use of a sheet of plexiglas.

[Initial Impression: 3]
As much as I'd prefer to play almost any board game to a console computer game, this arena battle game is a perfect example of the experience that video games can capture more effectively.  Players build the arena by placing modular tile sets, and then draft (randomly or not) a slate of champions, who are placed in the arena.  The first part of the game is usually spent running around and challenging so-called guardians in order to obtain equipment.  Then players begin to hunt one another down.  For me, the game breaks down when you realize that some of the characters (or their equipment) are much more powerful than others, and that because you can see where all of the characters are at any one time, the weaker characters can usually run around in circles or hide behind large obstacles to avoid being killed.  Indeed, most of our games ended after the painfully long three-hour limit expired, and the winner was determined by who was able to advance the most guardian tokens while running all around. All of the events and conflicts are resolved through die rolls (even though the die rolls are interpreted through an interesting scheme), which of course means that the bulk of the game feels highly random.  There's nothing worse than going up against a push-over guardian or a much weaker player with all of the advantage in your favor, and losing because you kept rolling high numbers - nothing worse, that is, except maybe being the weaker player and knowing that you can't get away due to movement restrictions and that eventually that unbalanced monstrosity will eliminate you.  The abstract little cardboard markers and the god's eye view really left me wondering why anyone would choose to play this rather than a split-screen squad-based first-person shooter. After several plays, I dislike it enough that I'll probably never try any of the other sets.

I love this game far more than I should.  It is random, the bits are ugly and not terribly well designed, the end conditions of the game just don't work.  But enjoy this game more than just about any other in my collection.  If I could just get others to play. (Thanks to Dogmatix and Subhuman, I actually get to play this now.  Still love it, even though my criticisms still apply).

If you like theme games with a different storyline each time then this is the game.  This one never gets old for me.  I love the random team make-up and trying to get them to work together to defeat the other team.  this game is highly customizable and lends itself to a multitude of house rules. The only reason I can't rate this a 10 is because of complicated rules that make it hard to bring to the table. The expansion don't hold THAT much interest for me. the new rule additions aren't that intriguing and the additional characters aren't that great either.

Tom Vasel's top game, lots of expansions that bring more terrain, bases, honour, more characters, etc. and modular board.  Quite a bit of luck, I'd imagine, but looks fun.  Combat doesn't directly win you the game as most VPs are for completing challenges, but obviously you need live characters to do that...

A great tournament-style game that can devolve into a deathmatch.  Though the expansions can add more variety, they also add unwelcomed complexity as well.  Luckily, you don't have to play with bases and can just sit back and enjoy.

I liked this about as well as I expected.  It's a quasi-miniatures game where you go around and kill things and have adventures. The theme is kind of funny, but the map is way too big (at least with four characters) and there's plenty of incentive to avoid the other players as much as possible.  Managing the risk is quite difficult to do; most of the time you will simply be roaming around and seeing what happens. (1 play)

This game, gentlemen, is a true winner. Modular board with different terrain types (buildings, fallen statues, ruins), loads of gear from different ages (swords, mounts, jetpacks, cars), huge ammount of characters from different walks of life (Genkhis Khan, The Bladed Terror) to draft your team from and blast your opponent's team to dust!

After 1 play I like this game.  It is too bad the platters are prone to warping (I used some plexi to hold them down and it helped).

I really love this game.  The theme sounds cheesy at first but when you get through a game you can really look back and explain a narrative. Ghengis Khan was pinned down by Robin Hood firing from the tower while Shadowdancer ran into the labyrinth to compete the final challenge for victory.

The mechanics do an excellent job of making you feel a part of the game.  Opportunity fire is great and the cards with the stats of each character that determine the difficulty of each encounter is genius in the way each character is balanced with their special abilities.

25  plays - We love this game, our most played game because we have the most fun with it and thus it is our favourite and have since bought all the sets. Intensity expansion makes it a '10' and is a must have and the only one really necessary. 

Combines other fav's like D & D, Magic, Squad leader and more. Awesome replayability and the theme is great, each character with different abilties, some from past, present and future hence the name. Personally like playing on 6 - 8 platters with 8 - 10 characters each, 2 person game.

We first started playing this wrong and it dramatically ruined the fun which I suspect other people with low ratings have done. Excellent website and support and a true gamers enthusiast type of game that needs at least 2 - 3 plays to get the feel for it.  There is a good dose of luck in the dice rolling but usually good strategic and tactical play will overcome any luck. Usually we never play pre-set time limits as it is just too fun, eventually we quit when character count drops (can be 4 - 8 hours later but we play shorter 3 hour games too) and we use a house system of VP scoring to see who won (closely related to what is suggested). 

Although the platters are too flexible and bend a little, don't let that stop you from buying this game! It is very insignificant in the end and is easily rectified for the most part. This game would be rated much higher by all less that little detail. Will be played for years to come for sheer fun and some great strategic and tactical play. 

[u]UPDATE:[/u] 12/05: After a lot more game purchases including some very very good ones, this remains our fav after 5 years and I don't see that ever changing, this is way too fun getting a random team of characters with different abilites, some good and some bad. Trying to use each one to the best of it's ability and making your team work together is fantastic. Good example, Pyraxian is ALMOST a useless character, unless you grab a long range gun and sit on a fire spot where no one can touch you by regular fighting(they can still shoot you back). We always want to play this game.

This game is not particularly subtle, but it is fun.  Perhaps the only thing not to like is the warped bits in the first printing.  We play with a sheet of plexiglass over the board.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (November 2011)

I bought this game based only on the recommendation of Tom Vasel. He loves this game so I though the game was very good. I have only played once in over a year so that doesn’t speak well of the game, however the jury is still out and I need to play it again to really see if the game is good.

I like the theme, although a little more backstory would have been nice, however the theme and idea of the game seems pretty neat to me, however the components are not so hot, especially the characters chits and the modular maps. I have found I don’t like games that have lots of carton chits. The art of the cards is great and there characters are very complex with many attributes. I felt this game is very similar to Heroscape, sans the miniatures and a lot more complex :D.

The game has a lot of (reactive) luck, and (generally) dice love me, the problem here (for me) is that almost always I roll high numbers so I did very bad in my only play. The modular board is pretty nice, letting you play different scenarios each time. 

I feel the urge to buy all the expansions now as they are getting hard to get :S but I’m not sure if I would play them. It’s a shame the game is out of print. 

Bottom line, the game can be very fun to play WITH the right game group. This is not a game to take too seriously as it has a lot of chaos and luck. I want to play again soon.

Current rating: 6.0

I (desperately) want to like this game, however it isn’t easy :(. I have played it twice and, so far, the game has not delivered. I feel the game is hugely repetitive, got to the nearest guardian lair,  try to beat the guardian, either if you did or not, you will reaper in a random location, rinse and repeat :S. There is no point on the game, it is aimless.

 I think it is hugely dependent on the game group. I just bought some expansions for this one and I want to try them. The rules are hilarious to read and make sense, and in theory the game is great! However in practice, the game is boring. The warped boards are a big problem, the game is almost unplayable as it is now AND it has a lot of unwanted luck. 

I will give it another chance, but probably I will get rid of it. This game taught me to not blindly follow any reviewer.

This is my favorite game. Each game challenges you to use the strengths of your characters, weapons, and equipment wisely.  Unlike most games, Duel of Ages creates moments that you will remember long after the game is completed.  Each game is guaranteed to be unique due to the large amount of characters and items in the game.  This is a desert island game if there ever was one.

Call the firemen, there has been an explosion at the genre factory!

Kind of feels something like "gladiator basketball".  You have the "hoops" scattered all over this battlefield and your units are trying to run in and score, all the while taking pot-shots at others trying to do the same thing.

I've had fun playing it, but it goes on so long and there don't seem to be that many interesting decisions to make relative to the length of the game.  If it was possible to wrap up this game in less than an hour I would probably think it was a blast.

The expansions to this set will really give the game as much variety as one could ever hope for.  If it keeps my 12 and 10 year old's attention for the full game and make them want to play it more....that is enough for me to give it a 10!!!!!!

I think this is the kind of game that gets better with each play. I love the diversity of characters -- the concept of combatants from past, present and future coming together to do battle is way cool. Just like that episode of classic Trek with Kirk, teaming with Abe Lincoln to fight off a Klingon and an alien. I think it's a good looking game, love the cards and board. 

One gripe is the bent platters. Wish they weren't like that and yeah they are fixable but some still flex up from time to time. However, as irritating as that is it's not enough to ruin a pretty decent game.

I need to give this game another chance.  It has some fun aspects: I like that it is a competitive team game, The guardian cards are humorous (as long as they are new/previously unknown), and gaining new equipment is always exciting.  With that being said, it feels repetitive and mundain: move in there and roll, get spit back out on the board, repeat.  The board is so big that conflict seems to only happen in the various "ages caves." Still, I want to give it another chance because I'm sure that if I played with people who really got into it and created a sense of tense compitition, then this could be really fun.

I like the overall concept. The mixing of genres is really cool; combatants on a terrain-covered hex map is fun. I think this is up my alley as a 2-player game in which my opponent can play quickly. As a multi-player game I see it bogging down and losing my interest. The rulebook suggests a 3-hour time limit. My patience is more tuned to the 75-90 minute mark for this game. Doesn't have the tactical depth I'm looking for to get too absorbed into the game and system.

Bought this solely on the strength of Tom Vasel's review. It's a good game but not in my top ten. Once you get the expansion the game really opens up. 2 and 3 are almost essential. It has a lot more going on than "Heroscape" and is overall a better game yet strangely I prefer the other. I guess there is no accounting for the "toy factor" in games.

Let&#039;s start with the cons: The counters are a little thin (I&#039;m spoiled by Java tiles), the platters are warped, the game is a mishmash of mechanisms lacking a coherent whole, and I wish there were more than 2 ways to score.  I also found the rulebook confusing at first.

The pros:  As a junkie of the cross-time, cross-world genre, this is the best translation of worldhopping I&#039;ve seen in a board game.  The variety of mechanisms, characters, and cards really gives a flavor of different time periods/worlds...and they interact.  Well.  A problem off CCG or effect-card games is that there are always some card interactions that yield ambiguous results.  Not here.  The artwork is excellent.

All in all, I&#039;m pleased with the game.  Unfortunately, the designer&#039;s excellent expansion system (none of which I&#039;ve purchased), will be tempting me soon...

Squad-based team game thats centered around completing adventures for points. There's a good balance between attempting quests and attacking the other players. As is typical of its genre, there are some terrain rules, different character abilities, LOS-rules. It has a Heroscape-feel to it. Components, however, are among the worst I've seen in a game. Tiny cardboard chits represent characters but tend to get lost on the board, and it was a real headache trying to see who was on which team. Thin cards, and warping boards. That is all you get when you open the box.

Note: I DO NOT recommend anyone purchase this game. The company has a terrible policy of not replacing defective and extremely warped boards (despite the exorbitant price we paid for mere cardboard), and they clearly care more about profit than customer satisfaction.

Very undecided about this one... This was probably a great game when it first came out, but the production value is quite low by today's standards. The game is entertaining, but this first version is a bit fiddly. To run smoothly you should probably be 6 players, or at least 4, with everybody willing to play for several hours. Because of this, the game seldom comes out for us. Perhaps the 2nd edition is better; haven't tried it.

Alot of talk on this game has spawned a bit of a debate...is it hype or for real? 
I personally feel that it is a FUN game...alot of different flavors are mixed nicely with a genuinly fun, "We've gotta play again" feeling.  Unbalanced characters?  So is life.... your group of characters can beat up those "better" characters with good decision making and the utilization of every team member's talents to their best ability.
Very tough game to get into, but worth the effort and reward.  Relates to different types of gaming friends...
Highly recommended for those who enjoy.....fun. 
One last thing...get the expansions and DONT judge on the first set alone...try out the other sets for the FULL experience.

I'll admit I looked into this game based on the high ratings it was receiving here at BGG, but I didn't buy it until I had read the rules at the Venatic website and checked out the characters. I was impressed by the depth and humour of the game, and it's fairly rare that you have a chance to pretty much see everything you're going to get in the game (rules, cards, artwork, etc.) before you buy it. I did buy it, and although it was hard to come by in Canada, I wasn't disappointed. It's not perfect, and there are certainly a few clunky rules (which are clarified in the master set and FAQs) but it's fun, relatively quick, and replayable.

Very fun adventure style game. It's lacking something that I can't put my finger on... perhaps, heart. But it has lots of fun toys, and tons of characters to interact with the toys, just no element of experience or character development. Imagine a not-so-cute Talisman with a much more in depth combat and trial system.

Great game.  Huge replayability and open-ended play.  Too open-ended for some - it's takes some time to figure out good strategies and tactics.  Suggestion #1: play with lots of characters!  It's boring with too few.  Suggestion #2: play with at least expansion set 2.  I rate the expansions higher.  The base set lacks meat.  The website is excellent and has all the rules.  http://www.duelofages.com/index.php

I gave it a two, based on the good looks of the artwork.  The idea itself is really neat!  I think this would be played much better as a computer game, than a boardgame.  I would NEVER introduce new players to this game.  Nor do I want to play it again.  I'd be sure to put this anachronistic parade back in the bag of hell it came out of.

Rating after 1 play: Luck seems to play a major role in this game, though it is still quite strategic. We played a two player game and used 6 characters each. The next time we will probably increase the number of characters to 10 or even more, since this would balance the luck a little more and increase the strategic possibilities.

RATING: 8
Not the kind of game I would like to play everyday but a fun, unique experience.  It might be a little long for a game that involves so much randomness and the experience of failing a die roll in a labyrinth only to be catapulted to the ass-end of nowhere is a bit frustrating.  That said I love the richness of having all sorts of crazy options available.

Fun simple little wargame with cool "accomplish a mission" add ons.  It has a bit too much in the way of chits and squares to match the vision of the rules and some components.

I like this game. While the way to win is simply to advance you gardian the furthest the game isn't all about that and really starts to take off once you get some equipment, trying to block off certain labyrinths, kill certain players, aviod others and still trying advance your gardian makes this game very interesting. add to that the variation gained with different keys and platters, characters and equipment and you've got a game thats going to be different everytime. cool fun, i also like the way you set your own time limate.

I was really hoping to like this game more.  On first play, however, it seems relatively unspectacular.  Lots of dice rolling with seemingly few meaningful choices.  Nice theme and use of humor is an upside.  Fun game if you are in the mood to move characters around and pick up stuff and roll a lot of dice.  Not enough strategy is apparent to me to capture my interest, though.  I fail to see why it has garnered such hype and fanbase.

It's a fast paced game with little downtime and lots of variety. The fact that combat is not the main aspect of the game is a big plus if playing against someone that doesn't normally like hex&counter strategy games (like my gf). It feels more like a confrontational rpg...

I had a chance to play a friends copy.  Just as I suspected, it ain&#039;t my thang.  Even if it was, I would be a bit disappointed.  There really isn&#039;t anything novel or clever here.  Move your characters around on a board, collect equiptment, and kill players, much like Frag, but with LOS.  The &quot;amazing&quot; novelty is the aspect of advancing your guardians.  Unfortunately this is nothing more than flipping over a card, rolling the dice, and seeing if you passed the test.  This part of the game reminds me of the adventuring section of Dragonlords, which I also thought to be a bit lame.  The game has nice components, can be mildly entertaining in the right mood with the right people, but it is certainly nothing new.  Heck, Ebola Monkey Hunt is more novel than Duel of Ages.  As for the humor aspect of the game, there were several people in my high school band that would probably think it&#039;s the funniest thing in the world.  I thought it was rather uninspired.

Supposedly the end-all be-all to pseudo RPG's. This game has a ton of expansions, and was a blast after playing it a couple of times.

This one is interesting. Its the perfect theme, but perhaps a little too war-gamey and we have to be in the right mood for it. Beyond that it seems to be a very solid package with tight mechanics for what it is. Nice boards (once you get them flat again) interesting concepts and art. I like the expandability that doesn't lure me to the dark side of collectibility again. I've bought two 'warish' type games in the last month.. OMG what's happening to me?!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is my rating with every single card and set. The game suffers from it taking too much time to get to challenges, but still results in fun from all the different ways that you can play and the different personalities and weapons.

The main problem with the game is that most die rolls are essentially not much better than 50/50. You spend two turns after getting to a labyrinth to challenge the guardian, and leave empty on what amounts to a coin flip. Even when you get an item it most likely will not be of much use to your character. There are simply too many bad items. The game creators were too concerned with putting out lots of cards to make sure that the cards were any good.

The same is true in combat, most times whether you actually damage someone is a 50/50 chance. For my liking, this is too much randomness. Armor should be a numeric score, and attacks should do damage if over that score is rolled.

Some modifications I would do: treasure classes, because too often you are screwed in the game because you draw crap treasure; vary the shape of every labyrinth, not just the expansion ones; an aid another action, wherein if two players are on a square one can give a bonus to the other if they roll a squeak and forgo any bonus cards; have the headquarters do more for the team it belongs to, like automatic healing inside headquarters, or a teleporter that allows you to go to one of your team markers with a yellow mental challenge instead of the jump pad. I'm sure I could come up with more ideas. The game has such potential, but doesn't really live up to it.

If I was just rating the base set I would rate it lower, probably a 6.

Great idea, fun execution, terrific variety. I love the idea of scenes like Geronimo charging into battle with a flamethrower to roast an alien monstrosity. Good stuff. It's a good mix of tactics, teamwork and luck, with some humor and weirdness thrown in. I like the wargamish aspect of it, with the detailed turn order and tactical choices. It makes for an exciting game with lots of opportunities for table talk, team work and conflict (both between and within teams).

Team games and games with lots of players can have too much downtime. It can be hard to keep track of who's who with the different symbols. Drawing a great weapon early can really unbalance a game, and certain character/weapon combos can do the same. But I'm not sure that's a terribly important criticism of a game like this. I can barely remember what the various characters do from one game to the next, and I certainly don't think that I'm likely to play this enough times to learn the dozens of characters and items. If you use all the cards, you're unlikely to have much duplication of characters and items for your first few games.

It's a crazy, weird, fun little gem that will satisfy people who like the theme and don't mind the wargamishness and fiddliness. You know who you are. Don't fight it.

Looks like the warped platters are not that big of a deal. Once properly flattened, they stay that way.

Great rule book (although download the Masters Addendum from http://www.duelofages.com, since the melee combat rules and setup rules are simplified and improved).Seems to play like a cross between Squad Leader and Talisman.Considerable amount of dice rolling, but tactics seem more important than luck.I like the 'play for a fixed period of time' element of the game - it works very well.Suffers in comparison to Heroscape, particularly on the 'bits' front.

Traded Zooloretto + mini expansions for this and DoA2.

Fun stuff!

I'm realizing that this is a game that doesn't fit my life very well. If I were a teenager or in college, it would be awesome - I'd need a group of friends who could all get together regularly and game into the small hours of the morning. I simply don't have the opponents or the time to play this regularly, which makes me sad. I feel the same way about Descent and Runebound, and similar games. I just can't get together and hang out at the game table with friends from 4:00 in the afternoon until 3am, eating pizza and drinking Mountain Dew anymore.

Got this right at the beginning of my collecting craze a couple of years ago and played it with my son a bit. Eventually though I realized that I had plumbed the depths of it - it was the same experience over and over, and it felt like I was playing Heroscape but with cheap, thin components. I did have some fun at first, and it was interesting to see how things would evolve, but I never really felt engaged enough during a game - nothing meaningful was ever at stake.

According to some reviews, this feeling is common after a few plays of the base game and alleviated by adding expansions, but I resent the idea of expansions. The components and art already look cheap and sloppy, why should I have to shell out another $30 to improve a game I only barely like?

A decent light wargame. It&#039;s biggest downside is that there is a huge luck factor almost to the point where some of your strategic decisions don&#039;t seem to matter much. The theme is great but its not for the imagination impaired. It also supports a great number of people and since you split up into teams you can move simultaniously with those on your team to lessen the impact of downtime between turns. Replayability is great as the board changes with each play and the characters you get and play agianst will almost always be different. The components are quite nice to look at however the boards do have a nasty warping problem. Overall its a fun, reasonably fast medium to light wargame.

The game scales well since players are divided into teams.  There is a lot of variety and replayability - no two games are alike.  Some of us liked it but it fell flat for others since they felt there wasn't much they could do (move, fail, repeat).  Also, while player elimination is uncommon, it can happen.

Was thrilled when I found a copy of Duel of Ages. Wanted to love it, spent a lot of time gluing the chits to pennies and ironing the warped board. Our game group found it too cumbersome. Wasn't bad, but there are so many *great* games to play that this isn't really in contention anymore.

RATING: 7
Okay - this rating is based on a few things: all of the expansions were used (and I'm not really sure where each part of the game came from), the rules were taught by someone who was very familiar with the game, and my girlfriend was on my team (it was the two of us against one player) and was able to help me with the colors, which were poorly chosen. If we had to figure out the game ourselves, only played the base game, and I had to guess between the green-yellow and red-black abilities, my opinion may have been different.

All that said, I really enjoyed the game! We played 8 on 8 with 3 platters. Our opponent got off to an amazing start, rolling 2s, 3s and 4s and getting amaze results like crazy! We were down 8 to 6 pretty quickly and figured we were done for. So we got aggressive and by the end of the game we had managed to pull out an awesome  victory.

The characters are all interesting and figuring out how best to utilize their strengths and overcoming their weaknesses is quite fun. The random weapons and items are cool, too, and you need to figure out how best to utilize those, too. The system is very clever and, while there's certainly a lot of luck in the game, it's how you manage the probabilities that will determine things more often than not.

Now for the bad stuff... the game components are just terrible. Cheap cardboard platters that warp, thin cardboard player counters that are hard to move, and a fair number of fiddly rules that are a barrier to new players. The game, like any combat game where you have a lot of decisions to make, does tend to take a lot of time to play. Our teacher used a homemade system of 15 playing cards used as turn markers with a couple of aces (one after 15 rounds and a second randomly mixed in the final 5 rounds so you don't know when the end is coming) that worked well, but the game still took somewhere in the area of 4 to 5 hours.

The bottom line is that every minute of that playing time was a ton of fun, with minimal downtime and some ability to plan ahead for your next move. It's not a game I would want to pull out all the time, but when a few of us that enjoy light combat games want something a little more in-depth than Heroscape, this is a great choice. I look forward to playing it again soon.

Boy do I want to like this game.  Awesome ideas.  Great theme.  Cool premise.  Yet doesn't seem to work correctly.  I keep giving this game 'one more try'.  But I think something is messed up.  It seems to be too scattered in it's goals.  It has elements of combat but yet really it's not very good at the combat aspect.  It has elements of questing but that isn't very thrilling to me at all.  We've tried to tweak the game with some house rules but just can't seem to make it work to our liking.  Still, it is a very cool idea!  *sigh*

Duel of Ages has grown on me.  Yes, the pieces seem cheap in comparison to other games.  Yes, the rules are somewhat arcane.  Yes, you need to devote at least three hours to have an adequate experience.  But the narratives that come from DoA gaming experiences are priceless - and the game system is pretty good too!

Frankly I found this game to be a tad tedious. Roll bad in the labyrinth and you get dumped back onto the board with no equipment and spend 6 turns walking back to the same spot while the people who rolled good take pot shots at you. I&#039;ll try it again with fewer people but I suspect I&#039;ll be equally unimpressed.

Not sure about this one.  I seems to be like the kind of game I would like, but in the two plays I've had, the game didn't seem to go well.  My opponent(s) seemed to have a mitt full of equipment and I had none.  Both games involved really bad rolls for me/my side and really good rolls for the opponent side.  It kind of makes me mad.  I still want to play several more time before tossing it out! :)

SOLD, October 2017 (FalCon)

Back in 2004, this seemed like the coolest game ever for the nascent game weekend crew.  We played it a couple of times to great hilarity, but we rapidly gravitated away from longer games like this in favor of other, quicker offerings.  Great concept, although a bit of mess mechanically.  I'm just glad it found a good home given the recent release of the second edition.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Downgraded after a few more plays.  This game is loaded with interesting, simple ideas (combat system, domes, terrain tiles, labyrinths, etc.) but they never quite come to together as a real game.  The cheap components don't help much...but basically this is a scoot and shoot "adventure" game without much holding it all together...too much of the game is in the card gathering and swapping and so on.

Unrelated, but why does every expansion get its own entry?  It should all be under one game...

I really hated this game, we all did. All that setup and all those pieces and the main object of the game is a race, at least at first and then, almost everything is based on a die roll and a combat chart. You have a bunch of abilities whose strengths are color coded and the chart tells you what roll you need to win a fight. A lot of chrome, for a terrible and repetitive game of dice.

Uno pseudo-wargame che non lascia il segno. Carina l'idea dei personaggi presi da tutte le epoche (ricorda il "ciclo del Fiume" di Philip José Farmer) e del gioco di squadra. Le carte impressionano per qualità e grafica, ma lo stesso non si può dire per il tabellone di gioco, che graficamente mi lascia indifferente, oltre a sembrare vulnerabile ai morsi del tempo. Sebbene il giudizio sia sospeso, il fattore-culo sembra davvero eccessivo. La peggior trovata - scelta demenziale e gratuita - è quella di prediligere la rappresentazione degli skill dei personaggi in forma cromatica piuttosto che affidarsi a una notazione numerica o alfabetica. Ehi! E i daltonici come giocano? Con l'insegnante di sostegno?

Squad-based tactical wargame with an interesting and nice theme. Cardboard and chits are too small; cardboard art not very appealing. Controlling two to three characters at a time can be wearisome. Therefore only experienced players should try controling more than two characters. Just so wearisome is tracking all the stats, equipment and special abilities of all the characters on the board.
After two plays I am very sceptic if I will enjoy this game.

Didn't wow me.  Combat was kind of strange--it seemed like either you missed completely or you blew away most or all of their hit points at once.  The questing element was a little strange too--it didn't seem like there was any way to get better at quests as the game went on.  Not really sure about the game's focus--I wanted to use my cool toys to battle my opponents, but the game seemed to encourage just questing endlessly and getting even more toys.

OWN Mar/04 (acquired via trade): Artwork looks fabulous!  Game seems like a PaintBall game.  Would I play it?  I don't know.

July/05: my son needs to age about another 6-8 months.  His reading is good now, and we've played some Star Wars battling games.  He's getting ready :-)  I still haven't played this.

TRY Sept/05: He was ready.  We played a beginner game, with 3 characters each.  If one was killed, it counted for the other team 'kill count' and loss of equipment (dropped), but then you'd get a replacement guy - no equipment.  Kept it from getting lopsided, while still in the spirit of the game.  Used kill count (2 vs 1)instead of # of remaining players for a end-point, since with the replacements, we each had 3 remaining at the end.

As for the game (shrug), it's ok.  Decent battling and racing and checking out different equipment, characters, etc.  Modular variable board setup will keep it interesting.  We left it setup for about 10 days, playing 10-30 minutes spurts throughout.

This game is a dice fest.  It has potentional if they could come up with a diceless variation.  Also, the platters and keys were produced horribly.  Misaligned, and warped.  I do like the computer generated graphics, and the characters/equipment have enough variation that this could allow high replayability.  If you can get over the dice rolls...  =(

RATING: 8
After 2 - 2-player - 2-hour games I'm rating this an 8.  I had a ton of fun playing it, and so did my friend.  Both games were very close, and all of the characters had their moments to shine.  I think this will become even more fun with more plays as I get used to all of the different character stats and items and abilities, etc...

Have now acquired all expansions for this game.  It is awesome.  I only have one friend I play it against, for it would take some patience and motivation to teach the rules to somebody new; but playing it twice a year is probably all I need to get my fix.  This is a fun and chaotic game, and I absolutely love it.  We used the dice deck for a bit (after some horribly unlucky games that left us frustrated), but we've gone back to dice rolling.  Playing DoA means embracing the luck as well as the chaos, and with that mindset you'll enjoy the downs as much as the ups. (update Nov. 2013)

If you strictly like abstract strategy games and hate luck this is NOT your game.  Still, the strategy aspect of this game is very apparent.  Those who complain about missing dice rolls are obviously misusing their characters.  The laments that this is a "dice" game are misplaced.  It's similar to saying poker is strictly luck - perhaps in the short term, but over the long haul, you win or lose based on how well you play.  I must admit, it takes a little while to learn how to use the characters, and, therefore, to learn the strategy (but isn't that a good thing?).  The expansions add a lot (a big LOT), but the base game gives enough of a flavor, and is a perfectly excellent game on its own.

Time to update the comments on this game.

First and foremost, I'm not sure if it was the art, or concept, or reviews on BGG that initially drew me in to this game, but I can say that after playing it, I was left scratching my head wondering what it was that I just did.

DOA is a game system but without any serious mechanics to draw it all together.  In this base game, you get 'some' terrain platters, a load of cards, and a raw concept.  The game doesn't really improve unless you get one of the expansions, in particular expansion #2 or #3.

Then we have the fact that the game can't really provide players with a goal, or endgame, or anything of the sort.  The way that the publishers print how the game should end is based on a time... Time?  What?  Why?  I mean, throughout the whole game all players are doing is rolling dice.  Dice to hit, dice to determine damage.  Dice to succeed in quests, random card draws to determine rewards.. So, all and all, it's random as hell.  So, instead of trying to give players an endgame in which to focus all of this randomness,  players are left hoping that they get 'the best roles' and 'the best cards' which, ultimately, have nothing to do with their choices in the game.. (other than knowing what your character is particularly skilled in and going for those challenges and avoiding the ones you are weak in)

At the end of the day, this is an expensive mistake.  Micheal Barnes says it best when he likens this game to a 12-year-old's dream game -- for the rest of the adults, just walk on by, and pick up something with more substance that can easily play in the same amount of time.  (after all, in DOA, YOU determine the length of the game...) :shake:

Update - This game and my owned expansions have been traded away.  Goodbye, DoA - don't let the door hit you in the ass on the way out.

1 play - arbitrary time limit of 60 minutes set (for sanity)

A team of 3 players .vs. another team of 3 players in the one game I played. I found the cards to be novel and the dice rolling not too nasty. However, even with six players running around the map, there was fairly little interaction as the movement took too long to get either to one of the mazes or to engage another player in combat (ranged or melee). This made for boring turns and turned me off to the game. I'll pass if this is offered again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Most unusual game, still ambivalent about it. Some parts are interesting - the way combat is handled and the race for equipment and VP's. However, it does look like a game that if you fall behind it is tough to catch up. 
Found all the different symbols with color to be use at different times to be confusing - but from what I can see that is what drives the game.
The fine print on the cards is very difficult to read.

RATING: 6
An OK game with some challenge.  I can see where you can work some strategies during the game.  I was not fond of the ages theme.  I have trouble envisioning Geronimo fighting a quarterback.  The adventures were very repetitive.  You did the same thing in an adventure, were sent back to the center, traveled back to an adventure site and did it over again.

RATING: 6.5
This little game takes you completely by surprise. It is very confrontational (which some people dislike), seems too simple, and very luck dependant (some would say it's a dice-fest, and I wouldn't dare to argue), and somehow still manages to be really, really fun, even amongst cold calculating eurogamers. An extremely social game, it has some strategy and depends on teamwork, so it's not completely luck dependant and allows for lots of interaction. I suspect its fun-factor is heavily dependant on the gaming group and the over-all sense of humor and light heartedness of your gaming buddies.

As an avid fan of Ameritrash, randomness and dice rolling, this game is supposably right up my alley. I played in a bit of rush and withouth indulging in the flavour texts and really enjoying what makes this game unique, the bizarre mixture of characters, weapons etc. from all ages and the odd combinations and 'stories' it creates. So my rating is more or less for the mechanics and the basic idea but I must play this again, with more time and dedication to the flavouring in order to really evalaute what it could do for me. I think the multitude of availbale skills makes it unnecessary fiddly. Why not stick with Strenght, Intellgence, Speed and leave it at that ? Still, a great game.

I finally got a chance to play this game and I am really looking forward to playing again. Once I finally figured out actually how to play things went pretty good. I do not think that I had enough characters on the board, only 8 between 4 players, so there was not as much interaction as I would have thought.

There was also a few things that I found out after the game that I did totally wrong. The rules on some things were not straight forward so the first game was pretty slow and clumsy. But game 2 will be better and I am looking forward to it.

A fun game, but definitely over-hyped.  There is no way that this game will ever "appeal to anyone" as a lot of people claim.  Are your friends going to become gaming converts when you start talking about "line of sight" and "opportunity fire" and "damage modifiers"?  I don't think so.  The rulebook makes the game almost impossible to learn, but once you do learn the game it's pretty intuitive.

Changing rating on this one to reflect all of the expansions that I own. I like this game a lot. Be sure, however, to set aside a decent block of time, and to play with people who move fast. This is an excellent game if played fast, and so-so if played slowly.

(Rating for just set #1 is 7. Personally, I think Set #2 is required, with Set #3 close behind. Set #5 is also pretty good, and you get the floating brain guy, too.)

Bought this based on Tom Vasel's review but it sat in the closet for a year or so. I finally got around to playing it with my two 8 yo boys. Huge hit. I find it similar to Heroscape except you loose the cool miniatures but gain easy set up, a little more complexity and lots of great cards. Ultimately a better game than Heroscape in my opinion. The equipment cards are lots of fun!

Lots of icons and lots of combinations between weapons and characters make for a somewhat attractive game.  But board is just too expansive, so game tends to be somewhat without interaction until one player is behind and then looks for the victory by eliminating their opponent's characters.  And yet, the solutions offered to counter that expansiveness (more characters per player) result in a longer game.   And for me, there is little in this game that attracts me to want to play this as a longer game.  While others might see a certain charm of having Genghis Khan running around with a plasma rifle, that facet of the game just left me cold.  For tactical combat games, would much rather play Combat Commander (or) Squad Leader.

--May2006-- A pick up from the KublaCon prize table.
--Apr2007-- Interesting; dorky; random.  Looks like it would reveal some depths if one continued to play:  the dynamics of the various towers appear, for example, like they would become more relevant if one could keep them in mind.  Similarly, a detailed knowledge of the available equipment of each age might provoke tactical decisions.  Still, I do not expect I will play often enough to appreciate all the potential subtleties.
--Nov2009-- On the other hand, I just had it in play again.  It was good fun this time:  perhaps it's as simple as choosing the right opponents.

Quite engaging...a satisfying array of possible characters in the base game here.  The feeling of vastness sort of tapers off once the game gets going, but the graphics are fun and the mechanics are well orchestrated and engaging.  Great for groups...like the open-ended aspects of defining your own rules before setting out to play (i.e., time limits, victory conditions, how many characters will participate, etc.).  Team aspects also pretty cool...looking forward to getting some expansions.

Rated after a pair of plays with some friends that have played [i][url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/6050]Duel of Ages[/url][/i] regulary for years.  I understand how it can be for them a cult or fetish object since they have ludicly grown with it, have a nice rivalry between them, know every aspect of this rich game, like possible strategies and combinations and how to play each character the best way (they have even designed some home made characters themselves), and because every single play the game provides very tense endings.  Nevertheless, even when the game is a nice face to face match, its mechanics and flow of play may be felt repetitive for newcomers after a while, and there are some unbalanced cards that may dislike them, without mention the fact that this is a dice fest, which I personally don't mind.  I didn't like the Line of Sight rules, since almost nothing cuts it, making impossible to take clever moves in order to infiltrate in protected zones.  The cutthroat version of the game is way better than the regular one.

This game brings together tactical combat (albeit in a highly abstracted manner), random maps, character improvement, exploration, and multiple victory conditions in one easy to play package.  A game with 4 characters on a small map is completely different in flavor from a 8 characters on a large map - using the right combination of map tiles and characters the game can become a tight firefight, or an abstract game of seek-and-avoid while trying to win via labyrinth adventures.  It all depends on the character density and game length.  There's nothing in this game I dislike in terms of mechanics.  The warped tiles in the early editions are a minor irritation, but easy to deal with.

Duel of Ages is one of the coolest ideas for a board game ever. Unfortunately, the quality of the components makes it much harder to play than it should be. I kept losing track of where my heroes were, since they blended into the terrain too well. Perhaps the only game that I've given up on due to component considerations. 

The game has a fair amount of randomness, but it can generate some awesome stories. The equipment can be pretty lopsided, since some items are much better than others (although this depends on the situation), and the characters are not balanced that well. I want to take a look at the 2nd edition and see if it solves the problems with the game.

RATING: 10
AWSOME!! My favorite game.  RPG meets board game.  You set the length of the game at the beginning so you play as long as you want.  The expansions add more character, weapons, etc. so it won't grow stale playing the same characters over and over plus you can create your own.  You can play with 2-16 players and if you have an odd number of players it doesn't hurt the game, you just adjust the number of characters per team.  Mechanics are great and with a twist you want to roll low. Finally a game where my Mage Knight dice are good for something.

It marries a number of game styles together pretty well and as such will likely have a lot of cross-over appeal between wargamers, CCG gamers and boardgamers.

The game is definitely fun BUT there are several knocks: component are poor (counters to small, background is too busy), rules are poorly written and needs extensive FAQs, the colour-coded character skills system needs time to adjust to, variable game length end condition is a cop out.

Aside from that, this is a solid hex and counter wargame with Ameritrash die rolling. Players have a team of characters with different stats. The game is about completing missions, tooling up and smacking the other team. Expect to have to refer to tables constantly (shooting, melee, missions) but the equipment cards are a hoot!

This game has very great potential with the right group.  The fact that you can set any type of time limit is a very clever idea.

While there is a clean system here and there the flavor text for everything is entertaining, I'm just not sure where the fun is.  What difficult decisions are there to make?  You just keep running into your caves over and over until you can get stuff good enough to kill other people, then you try to shoot them while you are  going back to the caves again.  

zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.

This game is just so aimless. It feels like you are just running the same path over and over again.  What the game needs DESPERATELY are scenarios.  There isn't even a set objective in the game, so you run to the caves, hope you roll well, hope you draw an item that is useful, and hope it turns out that you can use it.  Way too much depends on the dice, with very little of your own choices making a difference.  Yatzee has more too it than this.

Really, at the end of the day I just can't help comparing it to the genius of Gunslinger, it just pales in comparison.  That said, if there is something worthwhile to say about the game...it is better than FRAG.

Oh, and while the computer art is pretty and all, the warped boards are inexcusable.  It is unplayable without a plexiglass or glass cover.

Picked up the essential bits of this system based on Tom Vasel's enthusiasm for it; the jury's still out. Certainly offers plenty of variety in every way.

Playing with three on a side wasn't awful, but it didn't make me very excited to try it again, either.

It's just not quite a 7.  I do like to play and would usually be willing to play.  It's very light, and I can see how play will get repetitive on this board (the modularity seems forced), but maybe I'll get the Intensity set if that happens.  I see that at the 2p scale, you need to have at least 6 characters each.

RATING: 9
A wonderful game.  Extremely rich and detailed, and I think the dream game for those who want a "new" game every time they play.  It has a lot of color through the various characters, equipment, and other items, and is not so random that thought and skill will not generally tip the balance.  At the same time, it is not a game where you make a "bad move" four turns in that decides the entire game.

One reason it is not a 10 - I do feel as though the makers went a little CCG with all of the expansions, in particular the Masters Addendum, which are nice, but not worth the price charged.

An ambitious game - part RPG, part dungeon quest, part squad-level wargame - but it sort-of works.  Takes a bit of getting into, so you need to concentrate on the rules, cards and options, and probably play a few games to get it fully.  And you need to play it with the right group of people - for some it will be too hard, for some too "out there" (competing characters are from vastly different times in history).  Components' quality is also just average, but I'm still interested to play it some more ...

Great game with tons of variations. The fact that you could play this game with 2-20  is pretty unique, however I do think that a 2 player game is a little weak. My biggest problem with this game is the components! With the warped boards you have to put glass over the top of your game layout and even trying to get the glass down can be a chore. Once setup, and with four hours set aside, it's a load of fun!

A dissapointing game.  The component quality is poor...warped boards that don't interlock well, chits that are hard to see on the map.  Gameplay involves entirely too much running around.  Would have liked to have seen just one or two expansions with a higher price point for better components and tighter game play.  Maybe a "best of".  Stong potential however, and will be keeping an eye on the series.

Seems like a mix of Runebound and Heroscape: run around getting equipment and advancing your character, and fight the other team and kill off their characters.

A decent game, but other folks around here weren't thrilled so it'd not see much table time.

RATING: 2
Not a good match for me.  If I'm going to spend a couple hours or more playing a game I'd like there to be a. actual victory conditions at an end-point, and b. real strategy.  DoA is heavily luck based, from the initial character draw (some characters are extremely good others barely okay) to the die-roll based challenges.  Either or both of those would be okay in a short game of less than an hour, but this game really needs longer than that.  It's a poor wargame that tries to pretend to be something else by using colors rather than numbers in the charts.

I'd be willing to play again with a set with multiple expansions, but I'm going to trade my base set--I just can't see spending more on a system that doesn't interest me in the hopes it will get better.

Apparently a lot of people really like though, so it is obviously a good fit for many people!

I have played this three times now and each group has enjoyed it.  Each player is assigned a number of heroes from one of four time periods, ancient, colonial, modern, and future.  Most archtypes are represented (for example Centurion, old west sherrif, WW 2 sniper, Crystal alien).  Each team attempts to either defeat a series of time period challenges or destroy the other team with weapons from all four time periods.  (For example Claymore, Henry Rifle, Satchel charge, Particle accelerator).  Most of the charaters seem balanced even with great variety of skills and abilities.  If the idea of a barbarian with a flame thrower fighting a Cyber assassin with a Luger and Tomohawk appeals to you this game is a must.

Good theme play.  Game has many, many fiddly rules to learn but is fairly easy to play.  Game play is generally uneventful and should offer more considering the complexity of the rules.  Character special abilities are difficult to utilize since they require obtaining specific cards.  There should be many more opportunities to draw cards since they are extremely random and characters have traits such as strength or honor which prevent them from using many of them.  The game components are fair at best.  The modular boards were not that thick, warped and did not fit well together.  The chits were OK, but the cards did not appear all that durable.  The rulebook is in color and fairly well written.  Game length is set by the players.

[1 play] Initial reaction rating.  I don't think my first play of this game went especially well.  There is just too many stats, and tables an charts for a game that has a huge luck factor.  It is one thing if the luck kind of balances out, but in our game there was huge luck swings for both teams.  The difference between rolling a "flop" vs "amaze" can be a world of difference that you as a player have no control over.  Also the pieces and board were so tiny it seemed.  Ultimately my thoughts after playing this once, it would not be that hard to talk me into trying it again I guess.  Maybe I would see a better game after a second try.  But I won't willingly suggest it, and if there other game choices at the time, I likely would favor them.

I'm not sure quite what this game is aiming to be... It seems to present itself as a light romping war game, but it's as though the designer has never seen what the market currently produces. For the depth of the game, it's far too long (we played a 'short' 3 hour version), for a fighting game aimed at kids (which this appears to be) it's horrifically ugly, and for a tactical game, there's far too much luck in it.

It's also odd how the combat essentially has almost no bearing on the outcome since it is worth only 1 of 5(?) points available... Curious.

I own the complete set of Duel of Ages. I first was exposed to DoA at Origins in 2003.  I was hooked from the start.  No two games are ever the same and it is a great multiplayer game for any number of players. It combines aspects of many different games and styles of play.  My only major complaint on the game system is how the maps are warped and sometimes are hard to keep in place.

The different arrangement of map pieces and characters in the game virtually ensure that no two DoA games are exactly alike.

We've been playing this game & can't get enough of it. We have all the expansions & are just having a blast. We're talking about making a labrinth key for a 3rd team & having free for alls with 3 players. We see no complications in doing that. This game certainly has luck & randomness going for it, but there's also enough strategy to make it very interesting. Just a fun time!!

Cool game that's a mix of Squad Leader and ?? i don't know what.
I like the randomness of the character draw. Requires on the spot strategy development due to the nature of random teams. Dropped a bit due to non intuitive nature of colors -> numbers -> chart lookup. I guess I'm a numbers geek, but I'd prefer to keep the colors out of it.

Like I did with HeroScape, I was expecting this to feel silly. In addition, I expected it to be a little clumsy, with many rule ambiguities. As with HeroScape, I was pleasantly surprised by the experience. It all worked rather well. With 4 players, all new to the game, we had no issues at all. It's not a game I would play often, but it's fun to bring out every now and then. I enjoy the sense of really being part of a team.

Fun idea. Poor execution. The personality of this game is excellent.  But, truth be told, the actual gameplay doesn't require much thought. Move forward, roll dice. I have never felt forced into difficult choices while playing this game. And you quickly realize that the theme is not at all carried by the game mechanics of looking on charts and rolling the dice. It could be a fun romp if you're in the mood, but the hype on this game is unfortunate.

RATING: 8
I really like the concept of the game and it could be one of my favourite ones if it wasn't for:
1)Too small hexes and counters for "heroes" make it visually very unappealing. Bigger hexes and miniatures I say.
2)Heroes don't get much gear so it gets repetitive to play with same heroes
3)Having expansions is almost a must which makes the game very expensive
Overall this is the game that would benefit the most from a visual overhaul as the game concept itself is great.

Excellent game once it gets rolling.  Some of the wildest combinations of things can happen and if you roleplay just a little bit it can be fantastically good fun.  The only downside is that this one takes some time to play and the first 45-75 minutes can drag a bit.

Have only played it once so far. It was great fun, that's the main thing. We had a game that was full of running around avoiding conflict and doing the challenges.
Then it all came to a head and we had a huge scrap involving the use of fine weaponry like the Claymore, Sam Hill and some nasty grenades.
The game left us all wanting to play for longer and hanging out for our next game!!

Got this as the "Welcome" prize at BGG.CON, largely based on the lunatic ravings of Tom Vasel.  I did not actually get to play it until Origins 06 where I was taught the game by Tom Vasel (thanks Tom).  All kidding aside, it was a good time.

I have gone ahead and estimated my rating, but I'm not sure that my first and only game was representative.  There was considerably less combat than I had originally expected, which is good.  I would not want the game to be all about fighting.  In our game, we were primary just running for the nearest, most easily achieved goal.  Later we realized that we should have been more concerned with which goals we were shooting for, but it was just a learning game, so no-one was too worried about it.  My current rating assumes that the game is better when you play with the right goal in mind.  I am curious how team play will go over in our group.

This game reminds me a lot of the Star Trek episode where Kirk ends up on a planet teaming up with one group of historical characters (Lincoln, among others) in a battle against another such group. I think it could be a fair bit of fun with the right group of players.

RATING: N/A
I enjoy the idea of this game more than its actuality - so I've made myself drop the rating.

I love the different characters and the different weapons, pets etc that are available. However operationalising everything including line of sight and terrain effects is just a little too much work. This seems more like a wargame than a boardgame, even more so because you need plexi glass to flatten the platters.

The fun payoff for length of play just doesn't quite make it - almost, but not quite!

The amount of characters and equipment make each game unique and fun.

RATING: 5
Duel of Ages is a game that suffers from a severe identity crisis. The thematic elements appeal to players who are most interested in immersion, but the tiny hexes and chit based gameplay are a complete turn-off for that particular crowd. Yet grognard types that love a good hex map and an epic battle will be utterly repelled by the amount of randomness and lack of a clear cut objective.

When I played it, I went in expecting the worst because I clearly belong to the first group. I ended up being pleasantly surprised, once I got comfortable with the game's obtuse combat system. I'm not sure what the deal is with the crazy color coded stat charts, because it seems like there should be an easier method of determining skill checks. It's hard to know at a glance just what your characters are actually skilled at. I also think the game would be far more interesting with better victory conditions. Just scoring points for running to certain spots on the map seemed both uninspired and somewhat anti-climatic.

Most of all, the game failed to capitalize on the most interesting part of its theme...sending your hero to different time periods to gather weapons and items. The encounter cards for these missions are incredibly generic. If those had been the focus of the game instead of a side task, I think Duel of Ages might have been a homerun.

It's not bad, certainly more fun than I expected...but I just can't get into it enough in it's current form. Maybe someday it will get remade with a little better focus.

RATING: 4
I very much wanted to like this, but it fell flat.  Precious few interesting or meaningful decisions, and loads of tedious die rolling.  I gather the expansions make these problems magically disappear, but that's a lot to shell out for the "real game", and I'm annoyed that the first part, that you *must* have, is the weakest part.  The platter warping is excruciating, though otherwise the components are decent. A number of nice ideas that just didn't go anywhere.

I like this one less than I remember.  It's a fun time, but there is so much randomness that the game can really fall apart quickly.  In the most recent game I played, a character with really good weapon skills got a really good weapon early in the game and then set up in a killing zone around a couple of gates.  I could do nothing to prevent the deaths of half of my characters very quickly.

Only played once, I did like the game. I would have given it a higher rating but for two things. The luck factor, I take points off for dice games like this, making two rolls per attack puts too much luck into the game. The warped boards, not a huge problem, but with the cost, I think this should have been handled better. I would think the printer is at fault, but no reprint makes it look like a bad choice of cardboard stock.

The variety really appeals to me, especially the different mix of characters and equipment that will result.  I also like the simple combat/check system that allows for a lot of different details, yet remains simple and consistent.

Like most conflict simulation games this one takes some experience to really see it smooth out (It has a learning curve that takes longer to hit the enjoyment sweet spot on, but will stay at that sweet spot longer too).

Of two minds for this - first play (6 players, 1 player each, 2 tiles, 2 hours) was fun, with lots of challenges and fights.
Second game (6 players, 3 players each, 6 tiles, 4 hours) was much less fun - the initial character deal made it fairly clear who was going to win from the start - and as expected it turned into a major brawl in the first turn which ended up with our side being tied up for the whole game (those that survived).

What grabs me in this game is three things: 1. The conjunction of characters from across time, space, and fantasy: what other game can you have Robin Hood riding a ATV wielding a Chainsaw? 2. The sheer replayability. With around 100-150 characters and 400 items, you rarely see the same combination twice. 3. The fun. It's just fun. I love it.

This is a rating for the entire set.

if only the quality were upped a little bit.  this game could have really used some minis or something.  it's really too hard to see your little chit guys, especially with so many of them.  probably those used to old style war games will have no problem with this, but those raised on Descent, Doom and Arkham Horror will hate it.  That is my game group.  I liked that game, and would have liked it more if we'd have used more characters -- the more the merrier.  The full set item stack is truly insane... they could've developed more adventures instead.

Mixed feelings about this game.  I found the theme fun and enjoyed this a bunch the first few times I played it.  However, nobody else seemed to like it, not even those who liked Ameritrash games.  I ultimately traded the game due to lack of people to play this with and because I also started to get bored with it.  There was not a bunch of strategy besides chase down opponents and try to kill them (mostly luck of die roll) and roll random dice to see if I won the random challenge.

For a game that came out in 2003, this game feels older.  Poor production qualities and chits rather than miniatures bring this game down at least a point for me.  That being said, it's an interesting combination between a wargame and a race game.  Getting to play with several random characters can be fun.  They tend to develop their own personalities as you play.

Obtain and store goods, fulfill contracts in order to make money, use this money to purchase bonus cards and/or point cards and repeat.

The goal of the game is to score the most points by game end, which is triggered in one of two ways: 1)be the first to obtain the 14 level contract, or 2) all of the time counters run out.  During the course of the game, you will first invest or purchase bonus cards which give you extra goods in specific locations and/or building cards which provide points for the end game (this is one of two ways to score points), and then you will select a region to travel to and collect the goods there (and time counters if possible).  At this time you may also complete a contract if you have the requisite goods.  When you complete a contract, you receive money (which you can't use until the next investment phase, which is the next turn), and a new contract of a higher level.  Contracts once completed are retained and may be re-used over and over, however, you are only allowed to hold a max of 5 each round, so you often have to discard contracts (however you get financially compensated for doing so).  Goods are then re-distributed on the board in the location you travelled to as well as any connecting ones, resulting in resource pileups similar to Le Havre or Agricola.  One last thing to note is the use of time counters- out of turn, you can "tag along" on another players turn, allowing you complete contracts out of turn if you pay the active player time counter(s).  This is VERY advantageous as it gets you not only a free turn but also money before the start of your investment phase.

This doesn't seem to be the most inspired game, especially since it's devoid of theme, and it's the newest big box game by Uwe Rosenberg.  I certainly expected more, and yet somehow it works- I can say that the more I play it, the more I like it (even a mediocre Rosenberg big box game is a very good game).  It's a mostly tactical game, but it scales very well, it has a good length, and most importantly, it's "fun".  One of my wife's favourites.

RATING: 8.65
A great game that doesn't get much love, despite being a Rosenberg.  Probably a fair amount of that has to do with the game being more tactical rather than strategic, but I enjoyed that it didn't have the same feel as many of his other titles.  

Lots of complaints about it being too dry, but I found it no more dry than any of his other games.  I don't play Euros to get completely carried away in theme, though, so if it doesn't really "feel like I'm a merchant during the Thirty Years' War" (what does that even mean?), I'm not going to complain.  I find I almost always play with the extended time track at higher player counts, because I think it gives the game a more satisfying arc overall.  

Plays reasonably well as a solo, if that is your cup o' tea.

Sure, dry...but it's a Euro, people!  Took a long time to play the first game (~3 hours).  Lots of different strategies to go for.  Each turn is a little long, but I love that Uwe gives the other players a chance to "tag along" on the current player's turn.  I'd play it again, but I probably won't pick up my own copy.

1st play: This one is drier than most Uwe games. The theme of generally managing time and shipments to complete contracts is as vague as it gets. Time is such a tight resource, it probably takes a few plays to be able to ride along with other players productively and the between turn refresh is somewhat fiddly. Overall not bad but he has more than a few better games out there. 

No 2nd play: I'm not sure it will get picked again, but it's somewhat forgettable.  Uwe's games usually have a bit more charm to them, and while this one is mechanically sound, the dryness makes it pretty forgettable.

Okay set collection game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
So far, only played as a single player. For that purpose, it feels like it could use a bit more tuning. Minus other players, the cards that are sitting out are mostly static, and so depending on how well they work together, you can end up doing significantly better or worse. The solo variant tries to mitigate this a little bit by clearing the bonus cards when you buy a building. But the buildings themselves stay static, as are the contracts from 2-7. 8-10, on the other hand, change every turn, so there's no ability to plan for them at all, until they steady.

With a set of gradually shifting cards, synergies can open up and you can grab them while they are available. When it's all static, you're stuck with the synergies that are or aren't there right at the start of the game.

Not quite an issue with the game, but I'll also note that there's quite a few things that all happen when you plonk down the Cylinder of Placement, and it can become very easy to forget to take a time chit, lose a time chit, get some bonus cubes, repopulate nearby markets, etc. You have to be very organized and get into a "checklist" mentality every round or else you'll come out the other end wondering whether you cheated or handicapped yourself in some way. But if you do go through the steps listed on the player board, it helps to mitigate that issue. Still, it does make the game slightly less streamlined than it appears at first.

This does seem like a solid, virtually luckless (Or can be made to be) Euro, but I can't for the life of me get it to the table.  The solo-player component makes for a decent ride, but feels like a great deal of the mechanics of the main game are cut out.  This is about as dry as they come though, and that's probably why I can't get others to give it a go.  I'll change my rating to reflect the main game if/when I get more others to try it.  Definately not Rosenburg's best, but I think its definately downplayed by the magnitude of his other works.

RATING: 9
From Uwe Rosenburg comes a game with minimal components? Wow! Really? Ok. Granted there are a lot of cubes in this game. But the footprint of this game doesn't take up a whole table. The round goes by quick and players don't sit staring at the board for 10 minutes trying to analyze their next three moves. The time mechanism helps out the players as well as being the game timer. You aren't punished for not doing something and the paths to victory are varied. Merkator is overlooked compared to Agricola and others and we cannot understand why. It's a strong, solid Eurogame. Try it if you haven't.

Very interesting design that ultimately feels opaque. The game is also undercut by the appalling components -- poorly-fitting cardboard boxes in which players must fumble and pry for small cubes, and a lightweight board that's nonetheless split in half. Keeping all of this together in actual play is a nightmare.

As for the design itself, it's clearly about building a trade network, and yet I didn't feel like I had enough control over what goods to acquire to fulfill contracts. It's also very hard to distinguish a good contract from a bad one, and you lack control over which contracts to take. I do think there is some interesting gameplay here, and it probably rewards repeated play with more understanding... but I think Le Havre probably scratches the same itch this game does, and more straightforwardly.

Initially, I had fair expectations for this game: trade routes, lots of different products, time management, seemed like something I would enjoy.

Unfortunately, it turns out that it didn't really work for me. Did one play with four, and just found that the large amount of randomness in the game spoiled it. You just couldn't plan anything properly: buildings were random, contracts were random... by the time you came to play again, the actions of the other players had changed the game state completely in ways impossible to predict. So it turned out to be a game of look at your latest contract, happen to have the cubes for it or go collect them, fulfill, pick up a new, essentially random one. 

At some point, it looked almost as if the game was playing us rather than the other way around. A disappointment, don't really feel like playing again.

Essen 2010.  A much better game was waiting to be created here.  The limited number of contracts available - i.e. top of each value pack only, meant you could not really plan ahead, you got what you were given.  OK, its about optimising what you have, but then lucky/unlucky country/resource availability not satisfying.  Not were being able to choose from only four buildings.  How much better the choice and development in Le Havre, which this could have been closer to.  I guess all these limited choices are to prevent AP.  Just about engaging enough to keep and play again, but only just.

Some common mechanics with uwe's previous 2 gems, like the harvest element and different resources with certain abilities. This is not a bad game, and it has some intereting balances while it lasts a lot less than agricla and le havre. It also requires much less explanation. It felt like Uwe was going for a distillation of his previous games but the result feels rather like a family eurogame than a deep game. Not a bad game overall. Excellent production.

Rosenberg's 2010 effort is quite different from the Harvest Trilogy games of the previous years: it is an efficiency game, with the players rushing for victory points in a pick-up and deliver system, with some focus on incentives to other players to develop symbiotic relationships (to fulfil contracts while joining others). The design is streamlined and elegant, and the contracts system has potential for deep strategy.
The gameplay feels quite dry, but that doesn't bother me at all. The production is interesting (the cube-holding crates are designed nicely) but not so good: there's some board warping issues, the rulebook is printed on newspaper-like paper, and the board is a bit 'shaky' with clumsyhanded players...
The initial rating is a 6 after one game with 2 players, but I guess it could rise with more plays with 3/4 players.

This game frustrates me : You take the contract on top instead of choosing one, you may accompany a traveler but get peanuts for it, except for fulfilling a contract. You can buy a very expensive bonuscard that you maybe don't need and so on.... Agricola was top, Le Havre was close, Loyang was good but this is the first one for which I will pass.

Dry and themeless games like Merkator are usually an absolute flop with me.  I had a lot of reluctance to even sit down at the table when I saw some guys playing this game.  Collecting resources to fulfill contracts that give you points, just sounds so bland and uninteresting to me.  But Merkator has a few things going for it that really impressed me, and made me enjoy the gaming experience.  First and foremost is the fact that players can "join" the active player on his journey.  This keeps players engaged even when it isn't their turn, and helps to avoid that multi-player solitaire feel.

I also enjoyed the building cards you could buy.  These offered an alternative path to victory that players could concentrate on.  Sadly, despite these positives, I still don't feel like this game is a winner.  I just feel like I need a little more thematic interest for me to truly be entertained.  I would consider playing this game again, but I'm not going to seek out that opportunity.  But if you aren't hung up on theme, and you enjoy clever new mechanisms, I think this is a winner.

I wasn't expecting much from Merkator since I am not in love with Uwe's games.  He's a great designer with some neat games that don't seem to mesh with my interests as well as others.  Merkator was a pleasant surprise.  It has the typical, massive resources of an Uwe game and a lot of straight up trade resources for points.  One mechanic that I really like in the game is following other players to their location and provides an opportunity to plan and make careful choices that don't help your opponents too much.  I look forward to playing this again.

RATING: 6
As a fan of pick-up-and-deliver, I really wanted to like this game.  However, there's too much luck in the cards (particularly with 4p), and the "short" game plays too quickly for the luck to even out.  The random loss of cubes variant sounds awful because the last thing that this game needed was more luck/randomness.

UPDATE 2012: I dislike the game end issue of nobody wanting to take the last time token to end the game because it allows opponents to keep their extra contacts for half-value.

UPDATE 2014: After around 15 games without the random cube loss, it's an okay game but it's better with fewer players... since there will be less times that someone runs off with a card that you were working toward and leaves you with something completely different (the random card underneath).

Es un juego de mercadeo y cumplimiento de contratos. Cada vez que se cumple un contrato, se obtiene otro de mayor nivel que puede ser vendido o puntuar al final de la partida. Cuando se venden los contratos se obtiene dinero con el que se pueden comprar cartas de bonus o de puntos de victoria al final de la partida. 
Los contratos se pueden vender en una determinada ciudad. A ella puedes viajar directamente o acompañar a otro jugador en su viaje (en cuyo caso le has de pagar un reloj de arena). Los viajes además sirven para conseguir materias primas, que son las que te permitirán cumplir contratos.

Es un juego bastante entretenido y familiar.

Played a two player game.
The game has some interesting things in how you should maximize the use of your resources to get more contract, and thus more money to buy VP cards.
It is said to be a dry game, but my main concern is that is more of a multi player solitaire.
Being more solitaire it has a bit of dryness in the game, but it's not a big issue.

Merkator has been receiving negative comments, which is understandable if you compare it to Uwe's masterpieces. However, I find Merkator to be an enjoyable optimization puzzle. While it is prone to analysis paralysis, the game flows well and presents players with interesting choices. Knowing what cards are in the card deck will probably help make games even more interesting. On the negative side, there is little to no interaction - trying to affect other players' moves might lead to insufferable downtime, so players should probably focus on improving their position instead of undermining that of their opponents.

Based on one play. 

It's the least impressive of the Rosenberg's last 4 major releases. Though play is dynamic; for our group, the building cards were near broken. The limit of $15 and forced investment to buy potentially crappy cards was too much for us. The randomness and variability of VPs swung too much.

Merkator feels like a weird hybrid.  It's basically cube pushing - yet it doesn't really feature the ability to convert between types of cubes.  It has a similarity to Innovation, in that you need to "climb" to the top level of the card deck (contracts) to win.  This, and the contract seizing mechanic, is the hardest to wrap your head around.  Yes, you do want better contracts because they are "worth" more, but since the contracts aren't money, somehow the payoff of getting a better contract for fulfilling a lower one doesn't feel particularly satisfying.  Moreover, the geography is abstracted to such an extent that the pick-up aspect falls into the same slightly disappointing zone that the deliver mechanic does; works fine, just less exciting than I'd like.  The following-along mechanic, while seemingly cool, is also pretty hard to implement, so it happens so rarely as to make it an anomaly rather than a strategy.

Now, don't get me wrong.  This is a fun cube optimization game.  It's just a little underwhelming given the designer's pedigree.  We like the game fine, but it isn't in the same league as the harvest trilogy.

Great, fast-paced game. It resembles Splendor in many ways: you gain goods to gain contracts which can generate more goods for more contracts. Both games are primarily about optimization, setting up a chain of goals as you race to get certain cards before other players. Merkator, however, is a much longer and meatier game than Splendor, which may or may not be a good thing based on your personal preferences.

I highly prefer this game with two players. With more people it is extremely difficult to plan ahead, since the contracts vanish so quickly. With two players, there is a very interesting strategic element, as you can see and predict what your opponent is going for and react accordingly. This gives a fun race/push-your-luck feel to the contract cards (rather than the arbitrary feeling you get with multiple opponents). It also means you have more control over when the game will end.

Just one play, but I think Merkator has potential. It's another game which reuses themes from both Agricola and Le Havre, but twists them around again into a distinct, new game. This time we're picking up goods and delivering them to fulfill contracts in different cities in Europe at the time of the Reformation. Goods are acquired in a manner similar to Le Havre, accumulating in cities until someone decided to pick them up, but the travel system (which costs time and drives the duration of the game) is clever, as is the way contracts are acquired and upgraded.  Although the tactics and evaluations are involved, the game itself plays very cleanly and at a good pace.

As with all these larger, highly-parameterized games, balance is the worry, but Merkator feels reasonably good after the first outing. First playing was positive, and I have hopes for this one.

As with most of Rosenberg's recent games, analysis paralysis can be a risk, so be aware of that.

This one goes away for a bit and then comes back.  A solid game if a little drab.  Definitely a good 45 minute game for 3-4 players.  Neat use of time and neat way to keep everyone involved every turn.

[i]Merkator[/i] was the first new-to-me game of the month.  It was circuitously a birthday present from my parents, which is to say that I picked the game out using a gift card that they sent me.  I was fairly confident that the game would be one that my wife and I would enjoy, since our tolerance for dryness is higher than many, and system appeared to offer the kind of butterfly effects that would intrigue me.

The game tells the story of Hanseatic merchants running goods across Europe during the Thirty Years' War.  At its heart is a leveling-up system, whereby the fulfillment of one contract is rewarded with a new contract of the next-higher level.  At the end of the game, contracts are worth their level-value in VP.  The key to the game is efficiency -- synchronizing contract locations with locations where you can collect bonus goods and/or locations where your opponent is likely to travel (so that you can piggyback off their turn).  

At the table, [i]Merkator[/i] ended up being a bit of a disappointment.  First, there is a substantial source of randomness in the system that would appear to arbitrarily benefit some players over others.  Only one contract per level is available at any time, so the fulfillment of a contract will often reward you with another contract that doesn't remotely fit into your plans.  Similarly, contracts and bonus cards are distributed randomly at the beginning of the game, and exploiting initial synergies seems like an easy way for one lucky player to quickly take control of the game.  Second, seeding the locations with cubes during every round is painfully fiddly.  My wife would often forget, so, in an effort to speed up the game, I took over those duties.  Of course, then I couldn't focus on my strategy during her turn, which meant that she was stuck waiting for me to reassess the board at the beginning of my turn.  Although it doesn't seem like it should be any worse than [thing=31260]Agricola[/thing] or [thing=35677]Le Havre[/thing] in this regard, it at least feels worse, perhaps because turns are so short.  Third, we began to have component problems immediately.  The unmounted boards did not take well to the climate in our house, and began to warp.  By the second game, they all sat like saucers (the player boards in particular), and any small nudge would send them spinning like a top (we have a very smooth gaming table) with cubes flying hither and yon.

On a more general level, [i]Merkator[/i] is Uwe Rosenberg's dry, thinky analogue to[thing=39683]At the Gates of Loyang[/thing]: gather resources to fulfill contracts.  On the one hand, this game will hold no appeal for those who liked the colorful artwork and shapely vegimeeples of his last effort.  On the other, the game offers the same cold optimization core that lied buried beneath Loyang's attractive theme. Unfortunately, this is a species of design for which I have little respect.  From a player's perspective, contract requirements and values seem arbitrary (e.g., France wants three coal, a saltpeter, and a vegetable for this level 5 card).  But the contracts themselves are the only source by which the resources have value; resources are otherwise intrinsically worthless.  So the entirety of the game is simply a sort of mental processing that I don't find particularly interesting or fun .  Here, however, that optimization is married to heavy player interaction and domino effects that could be potentially interesting with the right group of experienced players.  I don’t think that it holds much promise.

My expectations for Mercator were high as Agricola is my number one game and Le Havre is up there too! So Merkator could probably only disappoint – and it did, but even more than I had thought. There are several reasons for this, but the biggest is that there is way too much pick-up and deliver, which I hadn’t expected as I had only played Uwe’Agricola, Le Havre, At the Gates of Loyang, Ora et Labora and Bohnanza created by the good Uwe which all have none of that. In general I’m not a big fan of this mechanic which should be clear when taking a look of my ratings of Steam and RotW. Sure, it’s a solid mechanic, it’s just not for me. Steam and RotW does, however, execute this mechanic in a much, much better fashion than Merkator which just seems… Clumsy I guess. The theme is paper thin and you don’t feel like you’re travelling around Europe, and when clothes can be made from fish oil and for instance 4 x coal can be transformed to a citrus, something doesn’t feel right… People who know me know that I don’t care about themes at all, but it still struck me how themelss Merkator is.

Further complaints about the game include the fact that, despite the gradually more expensive cards, I didn’t feel like there was a sense of progress like in Agricola. Also, there’s too much randomness considering what the game tries to offer. I primarily think of the time mechanism where you can randomly end up discarding an important good while other players don’t have to… Or the starting cards you are dealt – can anybody explain to me what’s nice about New Foundland?! I don’t really understand the good thing about the small provinces in general, but New Foundland is obviously the worst one. Yes, you are able to complete contracts and you can get extra goods as well (but so can you in the big countries), but you also give the other players better opportunities in the next round as it’s likely that goods will come out. And the worst part is obviously that you do not get a single good/commodity for travelling to the small places on the board (again, except for the fact if you have some bonus cards). But if you are dealt New Foundland as a bonus card in the beginning it seems you are at an unfair disadvantage.

I hoped I would like Merkator as I love Rosenberg’s other games, but this one was very dull.

I have mixed feelings about this game.  Whereas I like Uwe's other titles (Agricola and LeHavre being some of my favorites), I haven't heard "yeah" or "nay" on this one yet.  So it sits at a "Wishlist 3" until further analysis.

EDIT:  After much consideration, it's a "nay" after two years of no activity.  I have not read the rules, the same copy sits on the shelf at my FLGS, I have never heard anyone say anything about playing it, and I have never seen it played.  Appears to be a "flop" of a game, and so therefore I say "nay".

RATING: 7
I think this one is the least best out of Agricola/Le Havre/Loyang.  The whole mechanism of completing your order cards to get new order cards (instead of money) is neat and definitely has the slow-steady buildup feel like the stone walkway in Loyang (at least to me).  The problem is that the rest of the game is kind of meh, even though it does work.  The turn order is something that I don't generally care for in a game like this as there is no way to mitigate the luck that it brings.  Some cities are completely depleted every time before you can get there, or the good bonus point card comes up right after you played - that sort of thing that makes you go 'figures' right after your turn.  All in all, I would definitely play it again and hope to find more depth in it.

My wife and I have played Merkator about 7 times {3 in one afternoon} and we both really love this game, which seems to get more interesting and varied with each play. The only reasons I don't give it a ten are minor ones and don't have anything to do with gameplay. I think the building cards could have been thought out a little better, and they should have had pictures on them of the buildings considering the price of the game, and thats the other issue. For a $70.00 game I think the components could have been a somewhat better. The mapboard dosn't really look like a map,just a series of boxes that are connected by lines. But these issues are minor considering how much enjoyment I've been getting from it. If you like Euro games that arn't to complex with a good amount of strategy, this game is really fun. I've read some pretty negative reviews on Merkator and while this game isn't everyones cup of tea, it certainly dosn't deserve as low a rating as some that I've seen. I've only played 2 player so far so this rating should be based on that. I can see where more players may create a little unwanted chaos.

Meh. I’m split between Rosenberg games. Some I like and some I don’t. This one falls decidedly in the middle. 

The heart of the game seems to be finding a combo between contracts and locations and those bonuses that provide more cubes. Although you can piggyback on other players, there was no real negotiation in our game. It just felt flat and procedural.

This is a fairly unique trading/snowballing game that is not about buying low, converting,and selling high, but about maximising your trading opportunities, player cooperation and symbiosis, and time efficiency. It is an easy to teach game, an elegant study in managing economic growth under chaotic circumstances.

+ original economic mechanisms (seeding, growing, profiting, cooperating...)

+ pleasurable and non-stressful experience

= high but non-brutal player interaction

This was a fun game at first, but I ultimately found it a bit frustrating to not be able to really craft a longer strategy. I felt like each turn was just too tactical and dependent on factors I had no control over. 

The solo game was fun for a few plays, too. It was fairly well received in the game group, but my interest waned after just a few plays. I'm willing to play more, but won't seek it out.

Initial rating after two plays. However, I am not sure that I will ever play again: there as so many better games out there including several Rosenberg's other games.

The game and components look good but not spectacular. The different color resource cubes need to be storaged separately otherwise the setup will take too long. There is some fun in the game in trying to plan ahead in fulfilling contracts and evolving them. I strongly recommend the variant that allows you to 'reserve' one card for future purchase. However, the game appeared to be too random for my taste. I am OK with high luck thematic games but I when playing euros I expect to have more control. For instance, if your random bonus cards support your random starting high contracts you will have a great start. If not, well... In my first game I had two bonus cards for Italy but only one order for Italy came up during the whole game. Considering the very high cost of going into Italy I always had more sensible options and so did others. In short, I never used my two bonus cards. What puts me off the most, however, are the buildings. They give victory points but seem rather unbalanced: some give too few, some too many and several are too situational.

This is the game that made me realize, hey, I like soulless cube pushers! I guess I can see why it's not for everyone. Theme is virtually non-existent. I don't even understand how certain things fit in with the theme at all. The concept of time in the game didn't even feel like time. How can you "give" time to another player??? But I still like it. It's one of those games where I feel like there are difficult decisions, but I'm making some progress every turn. In my one play so far, I did feel like 4p is maybe too many if I were going to play seriously. Serious play requires paying more attention to what other players are doing, but turns are so simple that it's really temping not to, and there's enough to look at for each player that it's a bit of a hassle to scan 3 other player's boards. Perhaps more importantly, more players means a lot of change in the upcoming contracts each round, which is a little chaotic, kinda like a lot of players in Alhambra. Merkator does feel fairly standard for a "get resources and fulfill contracts" game, but also pretty streamlined to the essence, and the system works. One other thing I do like is an open market of conditional vp cards for purchase. Also, I do think that on future plays I will use the option to start on equal footing with no bonus cards rather than the 2 in the standard rules. The random contracts is enough randomization for setup, and already achieves assymmetic motivations, without the randomness of whether your random bonus cards happen to be good for your random contracts.

RATING: 7
Merkator is an interesting title in the sense that it is a growth game without liquid assets. The players are completing trade contracts by delivering goods (cubes) to various countries, and the reward for completing a contract is a bigger contract. The game requires you to keep a certain maximum number of contracts active, meaning you must invest in bonus cards which yield both points and some extras during and at the end of the game. Apart from one or two other details this is literally almost all you need to know to be able to play the game. As such Merkator is a very easy and agreeable title to get into. 

In my first skirmishes, I wasn't really sure of what I was doing, with the predictable result that I missed out on crucial contract overlaps and lots of resources even if said resource wasn't currently in demand for my contracts, and more. The experience was so abysmal that I could not believe that someone like Rosenberg had fscked up that badly, so I kept an open mind and tried again. This time matters started shifting to the point where I dared purchase a cheap copy at Spiel, and I've played it several times since to the point where I now look back in wonder and ask what the initial problem was, exactly.

Despite its simple exterior, Merkator is not an easy game to play well. The value of a contract expressed in VP depends on a considerable amount of game state information: the resources on offer, time markers at your disposal, the contracts up for grabs, and whether or not others can join you on a journey to a specific destination (for which they have to pay you valuable time markers). On top of that there is a more or less random influx of buildings which award points at the end, but at least allow you to steer your game into the direction they point at while the game is underway. It is not easy to figure out how to maximise your VP total given all these not-too-hard constraints. I used to think, for example, that contracts are the way to go, but the problem here is that these only slowly increase your VP total: per fulfilled contract you gain approximately 1 point (unless you bag the Westfällischen Frieden, in which case you jump ahead by 4) plus a whole lot of money. In a long game you may get away with attempting the contracts, but in a shorter game you definitely need to grab some buildings as their efficiency is higher.

All in all I like this game precisely because it offers subtlety in little clutter: its mechanisms are smooth and streamlined, even though they are fairly repetitive. There are no sexy stories to be found in this title, nor a surplus of cards, nor a truckload of pre-programmed roads to victory. In that it resembles another shunned title of Rosenberg, At the Gates of Loyang, which too was condemned by the denizens of BGG for being too simplistic. These titles most certainly have little in common with the big boys Agricola, Le Havre and Ora & Labora, but that doesn't mean they're any less for it. They are [i]different[/i], and different in a way I can appreciate. Perhaps that is why despite my initial setbacks I continued to keep an eye on Merkator and eventually added it to my collection: I recognised, if subconsciously, its combination of rules simplicity with game state complexity.

If there is anything I currently gripe about it's the game's usability. I'm not particularly fond of the small containers as my fingers are usually to big to comfortably grab a cube; in addition I dislike the fact that the main board is made up of two separate sheets of carboard. They always slide around in ways I don't like. These days such boards are presented as puzzle pieces, and I think that would have been a much more acceptable solution. What also helps is that I got the game at an acceptable price of €20, for which it is a solid title. Had I purchased the game at the full price of €40, I'd be noticably less enthusiastic—it's the same problem which plagues Loyang as well. The current rate is slightly optimistic, but I'm sure it will prove to be stable in the months and years to come; but for every €10 you pay over €20 you may deduct 1 point from the rating simply because of the simplicity of the components offered.

The shifting contract system is excellent; it gives a set you of transformations that you evolve over time. And the feel of your steps is far more cyclic (with no perfect entry-points or end-points) than the unidirectional "from basic to advanced" in most of Rosenberg's other resource-transformation games.

I'm a little concerned about (a) light player interaction (how critical does the "I go too!" mechanic end up being in experienced play?) and (b) replayability due to having the same "get 2 of X at place Y" cards every game, but they're both minor - I think I'd enjoy exploring this one some more.

(I might have enjoyed this even more if "number of contracts you can hold" was something that started smaller and could be upgraded, forcing a decision of when to plow profits into expansion.)

What a pleasant surprise.  Very different psychology from many pick up and deliver.  I feel that delivery rate is more important than evolving your contracts.  If you can get a nice rhythm on a couple of contracts, DO NOT SELL them, even if they're not your highest.  I evolved my contracts much better than my opponent but she was storing things and her building paid huge dividends.  Quite interested in trying again.

I've only played the solo game to get the rules down. Here, Merkator presents itself as a puzzle: Get the most points possible in 17 turns. While I had some fun optimizing my moves, I need to reserve further judgement until I finally get the chance to play it with more players. I'm interested in seeing how this changes things up.

Currently I feel that Merkator, despite it's boring presentation, is a rather interesting logistical challenge that just misses that special something that makes me wanna play it again and again. Maybe this will be introduced with more players. I just hope that someday I'll be able to convince someone in my gaming group to give it a try.

I have no idea why this is the odd-man-out for so many Uwe fans. I enjoyed the heck out of it in my first play. So satisfying to find that efficient route through the resources to the (hopefully multiple) contract fulfillment. Can't wait to play again!

Edit: After three more plays it totally holds up. The only thing I dislike about it really has nothing to do with the game itself... Some games you just get. From the first turn of your first session it all makes sense to you and you can't understand why everyone else has to think about it at all; you just sail to victory unobstructed every time. This game is NOT that game for me, and is very much that game for my gf. Maybe one day I'll make it close... :)

I'm torn on this one after a single play.  This is like a pick-up-and-delivery game with several different variables to consider.  It really is a brain burner.  Take a game like Empire Builder and remove the track-building aspect. Then add in different ways to get your cards and different ways to get to the location cities...and it will be close.  This game can really cause AP.  I can't imagine playing it with 4 people who want to analyze all the variables for optimal play.  You need certain colored cubes to make delivery.  You need to be at that city to make delivery.  But the colored cubes you need are at other cities.  Then you have cards that net you bonus cubes of yet a different color.  And the color of cubes represent 2 different types of goods.  There are bonus points depending on your endgame cube collection.  Then there are the new cards you get upon delivery...do you spend time trying to figure out how best to gain a specific "upgrade"?  I like the challenge of this game, but not sure how often it will get played.

Merkator is Uwe Rosenberg’s latest game, and is as different from Agricola, Le Havre, and At the Gates of Loyang as they are from each other. It is a pick-up and deliver game, with a secondary focus on incentive management and symbiotic relationships based on taking advantage of the movement of other players onto locations where you can fulfill contracts.

The structure of the game is fairly simple. At the beginning of a turn you can discard one of your contracts in order to gain money equal to its value with a requirement to sell down if you have more than five contracts. You can then use this money either to buy bonus cards, allowing you to pick up additional resources when you visit specific locations or buy buildings, which are much more expensive and give you bonus points based on specific requirements at the end of the game with a requirement to buy if you have more than $15. After that occurs, the active player moves the merkator token from its current location to a new location, collecting any goods present, time tokens granted, and fulfilling any potential contracts. Then each other player has the opportunity to pay a number of time tokens to the active player based on the location to follow them to that location and gain any goods granted by their bonus cards and fulfilling any contracts they have on hand. As contracts are fulfilled, the player who completes them may take a new contract of one level higher than the current one from the top of the contracts stack into their own possession. This continues until either the time tokens run out, or one player fulfills a level 10 contract.

Points are awarded based on the five most valuable contracts held at the end of the game, with additional contracts worth half value and additional points provided by purchased buildings.

Strategically the game seems to be one of deeply interwoven connections and subtle incentive management. Goods are restocked based on their connections on the board, and by taking specific goods you are frequently setting up another player to have a good turn. By setting up players who will travel to locations you want them to go, you can potentially fulfill contracts, and thus get pay-outs, faster, but also encourage them to go places that will set you up even more. Similarly, by allowing someone to complete a contract, you can potentially cause them to grab a contract that you don’t want, opening the way for you to take a contract that is more valuable for you.

I suspect that playing at the described level will require a bit of experience. Individuals must know the deck to have an idea of what is coming and to be able to recognize what other players want enough to properly incentive them. These are things that interest me, because I particularly enjoy games that blossom as the players get more experienced. If you are one who needs a game to be amazing from the first play then Merkator may not be for you. It is good, but it is definitely a game that requires familiarity to truly stand out.

Felt like a souped-up Hansa to me.   You have more liberty to move around the map to make deliveries and acquire goods, plus the ability to follow other players, sometimes at a premium cost of time units.   The game has a good look to it, including some storage bins for the goods - those are the signature visual element, but they aren't very functional.   Buildings are expensive but seem to be the key to victory.   Nothing terribly thrilling here but I'd be willing to play it again.

Wow, Very elegant game. I prefer with two players (long game) - 1 card reserve hand, no following, no reserve board cubes, no coins, no starting bonus cards, no loss of goods, one time counter for starting second, when buying bonus card receive one good of type. 

This is the perfect Lindy game.

It is far far away from Agricola or Le Havre.
Much more random also.

Next thing, game rules includes many wariants and it is hard to decide whitch combination of them you want to play. Definitelly basic rules are not my favourite, but I haven't tested all of the variants. It seems like designer wasn't sure about how game should work and leave this decision to players with only some suggestions.

This was just so boring and tedious for us.  Seems that you have VERY little control, as you only get the contract that's on the top of a particular pile and only 4 bonus or building cards are available...and ey may not work for what YOU are able to accomplish.  

I see no need for the "travel along" feature except for maybe in a 4-player game....just pointless IMO.

RATING: 9
A very clever and enjoyable game!  Integrates the theme and game mechanics in a remarkably synchronous way. Although no combat is part of the play, the effects of the 30 years war are felt by implication in the bottlenecks created by the randomization of the card decks and board layout. The theme is true and pure - you are the merkator monitoring your supply chain empire as it grows from nothing to a surfeit of goods stuffed warehouses, building assets and a desk-top full of valuable contracts. Requires a focus on mitigation strategies that give you the economic agility to either: overcome the fates that threaten to strangle your enterprise or to seize the opportunities to build on your good fortune. All the elements of fun are here: goods procurement, the cash flow engine, infrastructure development, contract fulfillment and time management. And with a simple solid rule set that makes play easy to mount and efficient on the clock (typical two player game is done in 45-60 minutes). Very well produced components, hundreds of brightly colored cubes and awesome little cargo crates to hold them!  The board has cutouts to securely hold each of the eight crates. Nice touch!!  We love it as a two player!

I like games where you can leech off other players' actions, and I see what Uwe was going for here, but this one simply didn't have enough depth for me. Or rather, it doesn't have the kind of depth I enjoy. In order to be successful, an astute player would look at other players' boards to ascertain if going somewhere will help them or not (of course you don't want to), but that could be a review of 10-20 contracts each turn. I'm not interested in doing that. Furthemore, I found little tension as regards picking up cubes or contracts. It all felt very middling; nothing terribly wrong with the game but nothing to think about in between plays. 

I ended up trading my copy for Paris Connection.

I can see scope for the analysis paralysis group to destroy the fun element in the game for me but on the basis of the game I played, then this was fun, and felt like Le Havre stripped to it's core elements (so without the awkwardness of the buildings). My score reflects my AP concerns on game length vs enjoyment.

B&B/purchased 2010/arrived 2011

This game grabbed me--Something about the trading was just felt very satisfying.  

An elegant game because the board is beautifully designed with nice open containers for the components, the game is fast-paced, plays solitaire, and the rules are few, easy, and well written.  Expert rules and variants add to the re-playability.

The play is fast because you can plan your whole turn while another is taking their turn.  Also it is possible for players to join the active player on his turn and fulfill contracts, which also speeds up play.

This is one of the few games I own that does not issue Player Pieces--no score marker in my color, action markers, or any other components that belong exclusively to me.  players have identical game board.  Victory Points win the game, and are counted at game end.

I like the unique way goods are distributed.  Also, the limit on money is unusual--15 Taler and you are forced to invest, or discard down.

The one complaint I have--I want to keep the commodities in the assembled boxes.  There is no way provided to store the commodities (there are 40 each) in the boxes securely.  There is no cover for the boxes nor an insert that for them with the board used as the cover.  I have slipped each into a baggie, keeping the boxes assembled.  If the box gets carried around, I hope the boxes don't get damaged by the game boards, even though the boxes are heavy cardboard.

RATING: 5
So far a very enjoyable game.  It sounds like the most vanilla pick up and deliver: there's contracts, get cubes, travel to destination to fulfill contracts for money.  But the brilliant part of the game is that everyone has their own contracts, and can fulfill them as many times as they like which enables an engine to be built, or several as the case may be, and cranked throughout the game.  There's a very nice tension between continuing to crank and refining the engine you have or push for a more valuable engine at endgame.

Where the game gets a bit muddled for me is what it's trying to be.  It doesn't seem heavy enough to give that meaty game satisfaction, yet there seem to be just too cards and such to keep track of to really be enjoyable as something on the lighter end of the spectrum.  I imagine things get a bit smoother with time and if that's the case, I'll have to up my rating.  It's a nice little system.  Right now I just feel like I have to do a little too much micromanaging.

RATING: 7.5
Merkator is a solid, underrated game IMHO.  It is a compelling pick-up-and-deliver extravaganza that rewards planning, but provides a plethora of tactical opportunities as well. There isn't a lot of interaction, but the ability to tag along on the journeys of other players keeps things interesting even when it's not your turn. Merkator is like a giant solitaire puzzle to solve, racing against the other players to see who can figure out their version the quickest. There are all kinds of goods to pick up and store up for fulfilling all kinds of contracts, and there are multiple reasons for picking up contracts to fulfill as well.  While not as much pure fun as something like Carson City, it's an enjoyable way to exercise one's brain, and I look forward to trying it again soon.

RATING: 6
Merkator is classified as a pickup-and-delivery game but I'd hesitate to call it that because while you do collect goods and load them off to fulfill contracts the spatial aspect is pretty much non-existent.

What remains often feels like a big, competitive puzzle, a dry cube conversion game with a very relevant interactive component. Other players may participate in your actions, so ideally, you would always have a good grasp of your opponents' tableaus to see where they do or don't benefit. Unfortunately, that seems unfeasible, simply because the board states are changing too quickly. Sixteen different resource types, a handful of contracts per player, and various bonus and building cards just add a lot of noise, the need for bookkeeping, and a certain level of chaos.

RATING: 6
I'd hate to say that Merkator is not a good game. There are strong, essential mechanics here that are fine for any connoisseur of the almighty Euro. I enjoyed the game, but I felt the experience was washed out by a lot of mechanics that we've already seen before in so many Euros. Also, the game engine is very simple, to the point of being a bit colourless. There is enough luck in the game (more than I'm used to in a game like this) that doesn't allow for any sort of heavy engine optimization, and that can be frustrating at times- but not that intriguing sort of frustration. There is definitely a place in Rosenberg's ludography for Merkator; I just don't think it's a game that will stand up in the long run to his signature games. It is solid experience but I came away feeling a bit dulled out by the process.

After having watched Rahdo's Run Through and then having played some of it as solo, I felt this really is an under rated game. How did this get so overlooked? Was it the name? This game is cool! I love it.

I've only played it solo, but I found it challenging. You only have so many moves to get as many points as you can. The expected goal for a beginner is 55, experienced is 60, and for an Uber Merkator is 80 victory points. As of writing this I had not finished my first game, but was very much enjoying it at the time. 

To reach those victory points amounts to buying up cards that help you acquire more goods or victory points, and fulfilling contracts. The contracts are delivery of these goods to locations on a map. 

One really neat thing about this game that I have not seen (for myself) up to this point is the way the punch out board works. Once you punch out the boards, you take pieces of the punch outs to form boxes to put the supplies in. The boxes fit into slots on 2 other boards which go together to form the map. That's the coolest thing I've ever seen. So now the goods are in boxes, right on the map and they don't slide around. When you're done playing the game, you simply pick up the boxes and slide them right into plastic bags. Awesome!

Merkator's problem is that it looks and sounds boring and bland and generic and outdated - in all aspects from the title to the box to the board to the theme. But I really enjoy it despite its dryness and its lack of outward charm.

This is a game of untangling a stream of little logistical knots. It's something that might appeal to a tax auditor or an overqualified telephone receptionist. You probably need to be a little bit anal retentive to like this game - but not too anal retentive, or you'll be frustrated by your inability to form a stable long-term plan. Merkator is a game where you're constantly throwing out the old plan and making a new plan. You don't have very much control over which contracts will be available to you. So you better figure out how to squeeze a profit out of whatever jumble of mismatched parts you can find.

I'd also like to note that Merkator plays very well solitaire if you're ever in the mood for that sort of thing. Of the recent Uwe Rosenberg games, I would the Merkator solitaire game rates behind the At the Gates of Loyang solitaire game, but ahead of the Agricola and Le Havre solitaire games. Which is basically the exact opposite of how I'd rate them as multiplayer games (Agricola/Le Havre best by far, then Merkator, then Loyang which I'd frankly rather play solitaire than multiplayer).

Played 10+, once with 3 and twice with 2. I'm a happy cube pusher, I like  gathering resources and turning them into victory points. I think this makes for a good 2 player game, I can see couples enjoying it provided they are prepared for a 90 minute game, forget the 45 mins on the box, that must be for solo play. Apr 11

*UPDATE* My 5th playing and I reluctantly admit this game is a bit dull. Dropped my rating to a 6. June 11 

*UPDATE* My 10th playing (the last 5 games all just 2 player). Now I have introduced Merkator to my partner it has risen in my estimation because she really enjoys it and that drags the game up from a 6 to an 8. An enjoyable couples games for those who only normally play Lost Cities. We play with the slow start rules and for 2 player games we don't allow out of turn follow ins. July 11

A very solid cube-pusher. You'll collect your different cubes in various localities and fulfill contracts in other localities. There's some solid plan-ahead choices to make regarding what items to save for possible future contracts. The globe-trotting theme is sort of wasted on the presentation though, as the locations are really only different in the sort of goods and contracts available. The presentation could have helped here, but it doesn't. Ah well. As I said, a solid cube-pusher.

Easy to learn as play is limited to 
i) investing in bonus cards or victory cards - nice touch here as you are forced to invest if you own more than 5 contracts
ii) travel to one of the locations and collect goods there
iii) fulfill contracts if they require this location and receive more valuable contracts in return.

The game shines as you are allowed to travel along with other players and fulfill contracts during their turn as long as one can pay the time necessary for this.

I was really excited to try this.  I love pick-up-and-deliver games, and this promised to boil it down to its essential elements and play in under two hours, plus there was the slightly goofy way that time and contracts worked, which made it ALSO an engine-building game.  Sounds good, but in practice the game was just a little too stripped-down to be very exciting.  Toward the end, it became rather repetitive, as good contracts could be used over and over again.  The bonus cards were also rather disappointing, as they were usually worth fewer points than the cards you traded in for them.  I was disappointed with the game as a whole. Would love to change my mind... 

Update: have played more, have changed my mind. It's a very nice light pick-up-and-deliver, especially with two. Recommend playing without the goods decay rule.

Me parece un juego por debajo de la calidad de los de la trilogía de las cosechas. No es un juego malo, sin embargo. Es más bien... soso. Carece de tema y el tablero parece un diagrama de flujo. Además, nunca triunfa en la primera partida. Es un clásico "pick and deliver" (toma cubos de un sitio del tablero, llévalos a otro para conseguir cartas que te dan más cubos o PV's al final de la partida). Me gusta que cuándo vas consiguiendo cumplir contratos, no te den más dinero, sino más contratos que valen más PV's y son más difíciles de cumplir. Esto da cierta sensación de "crecimiento" de tu "empresa de logística de la Guerra de los Treinta Años". PROS: juego corto mucho mejor que el largo. Pocas reglas y elementos. CONS: todo el mundo esperaba algo mejor, así que decepciona en ese sentido. Los contratos (cartas) dan sensación de poco control del juego. Nota provisional un 6 -6.5

Only played two games, but am enjoying it. Tactical, but well-designed and about the right degree of difficulty for the family.

Update 4-18-11: A well-designed game that shows strongly as a two-player game. Makes it a little more likely to plan for contracts or buildings while also increasing the importance of buying a card that someone else wants. All that means you will definitely be paying attention to your opponent's work throughout.

This is a very good but not great game.  It does seem a little dry.  I like the interesting way contracts are not disgarded when fullfilled and can actually be fulfilled multiple times over the course of the game.  This typically takes people some time to wrap their head around.

Merkator is a well-designed game that deserves more interest than it has received - it really needs a few plays to reveal its best qualities. It may initially seem that the results of a game depend to a significant extent on which contract and building cards are revealed and when. But with experience, players begin to engage in longer-term planning that takes into account which cards are available. Merkator workds well with 2, 3 or 4 players. I would recommend the longer variant as it reduces the chance element of the set up and enables players to achieve the higher value contracts.

[i]Maybe[/i] a little better than Loyang, not near as good as his big 2, that's the short rundown. 

Merkator is a contract filling game (with a p/u & del aspect to it) that did have a shade or two of Loyang in it, complete the contracts, get better contracts and buy point cards from a face up pile (4 face up to choose from, this is a weak point since whatever is there is there randomly so this could have been done better). Point cards are also contracts that have to be "met" for the endgame. Though these come up randomly its not as bad as it sounds and [i]most[/i] of them are balanced and you DO have time to setup for them, its just kind of crappy that you get forced to buy them at certain times and have a VERY limited choice on which to buy (I think he did this to limit AP but I'm not happy with the result). 

I found it mostly tactical, a little planning and a litle more once you start getting some scoring cards as you do need to setup for the them before the endgame so a little more in the last half than the first (but you are still acquiring point cards in the last half and you mostly have no idea which ones are coming up or especially will be available on your turn). Simple ruleset but somewhat convoluted play as you look around and analyse the best way to max out, this might fool some into thinking depth but its just linear analysis really, there are lots of things to keep an eye on and it takes time to peer around and track them. 

Some sharing in the contracts thrown in to limit the downtime and to try and increase interaction. There's some AP in the game (mostly just looking around trying to max out) but players will get much faster in future games as they get use to all the things they need to keep an eye on.  Other experienced players in my game were fairly fast, it was my first game and I was the slowest for sure. Overall it kept me interested but its a lot of cube shuffling in the end just to grab money to buy point cards and I'm not sure really what the theme is other than a "trading" game. Game ended in a good amount of time and before wearing out its welcome like 90 mins. Only one play, would play again, I see people saying it improves with more play/familiarity and I can see why though my rating would likely not go above 7.5 IF it went up. Overall though, Euros like this where nothing really stands out are more or less falling out with me.

RATING: 7
This is a very underrated game from Uwe. At its core, its a pick up and deliver game. You play as merchants that pick up goods from one location and delivers it to another location with your contracts. Gameplay can get quite repetitive but the way the contracts escalates from basic 1 good delivery to complex multiple combination of goods creates just the right amount of tension throughout the game. The only complain I have is the potential randomness and screwy luck with the way the contracts appear in game. Would definitely play this again.

Everything seemed pretty straightforward, try to find places where you can complete multiple quests at once and/or have some bonus cards for and/or that give cubes in the colors that you need for other such places. It seems like a lot of points are from buildings, and the buildings are wildly different in quality, which seems a little weird. I guess there's no harm in it because it's a common offer, but the fact that there are sometimes some effectively dead spots in the offer is a little weird. Interesting enough and I'm glad to play it but it certainly doesn't excite me.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (January 2016)

Uwe Rosenberg is one of my favorite game designers. I always buy his games without knowing anything more about them, so I was very keen to play Merkator. It is a good Euro game.

The game components are very nice and, when assembled, the game looks gorgeous. The rules are easy to explain, you can do it under 16 minutes. The art looks boring (the cover is particularly guilty of this, it seems outdated but it is a 2010 game).

It offers some interesting decisions (which contract to sell, where to travel, should I accompany the current player, what building to get, how many resources of each kind?). Deciding how to spend your time is also great fun.

I think it is best as a 3 player game, with 4 players the downtime is excessive for me. It lends itself to analysis paralysis.

There are some random elements in the game (the buildings, how the contracts appear, the random good you lose at the end of each timeline) but in general I feel I have a lot of control so I´m not bothered by the luck factor (yet). 

I just found out there are some minor translation issues in the rulebook (a very minor quibble), but there is a translation error in at least one card. That mistake broke the card. I don’t remember the name but if you build that building you get points for every good in your storage, the correct version is that you get points for every KIND of good in your storage. In our game, the player won had that card and I have told in previous games the same situation arose.

Bottom line, I almost never like pickup and deliver games, but I liked this one. It feels different than most Rosenberg´s games. The rules are very easy to explain, but it features meaty decisions. I want to play it again soon. 

One of 2010´s favorites.

Merkator is a rules-light pick-up-and-deliver game with a multitude of different goods. I'm concerned about the chaos - pick-up-and-deliver as a genre is heavily reliant on forward planning, and I can't count on a particular contract being available to pick up from the stack one or two turns ahead. Though I can count on still holding the contracts I have in hand, so some planning is possible. The player interaction is the standard "pull stuff from the board faster than other players" interaction, but compared to other such games like the Empire Builder series or even Merchant of Venus, there's a lot of such stuff. So Merkator by the standards of its genre is heavily interactive.

I'm enthusiastic about Merkator myself, but games of this genre tend to appeal to me more than to the average gamer.

Update:  after play 3 I still like the concept and enjoy playing the game, but I really don't care for the building cards.  I will still play.

I have played this game a few times now and is is definitely one of my favorite games. The options available are plentiful and yet the actual turn you take is simple.  The challenge is trying to identify the best move to make. Every thing has some synergy with everything else. Identifying these connections is a key strategy to success and for me a fun puzzle. I can see how this game might not be for everyone though. Learning the moves is easy, learning the game much more challenging.  Until you become more comfortable with the game the turns can drag. 
Just played a two player game that had a very unsatisfied anticlimactic ending. The building cards also seem to be uneven and some are much more powerful than others. Still a favorite but might not hit the table as much as some other games.

Gamers are spoiled and fatigued by Rosenberg's setup-heavy harvest trilogy. Otherwise, I can not understand why Merkator did get the cool reaction it got post-Essen. In my personal ranking, it's almost on par with Agricola and Le Havre, way better than Loyang and one of the best Essen 2010 releases.
This time it's pickup and delivery. A genre, I'm enjoying a lot. Milking efficiency best is decisive, making it more calculational and dry than his other recent efforts but at the same time leaner. The learning curve is not very steep, especially compared to Le Havre which might be a drawback for hardcore gamers. The random card draw introduces a noticeable luck factor and shifts focus to tactical play. Setup time is shorter than for the rest of the harvest trilogy but still long. All in all, Merkator is a game for the experienced Euro crowd that likes to optimize each move. For others it probably will fall in the JASE category.
Give the long game variant a try. I would guess that Merkator first was conceived that way.

RATING: 8
Another brilliant game by Uwe Rosenberg with the ability to have many, many replays.  The balance between where to go, what goods to take, what contracts to fulfill, what buildings to buy, and what bonuses to get makes for a fascinating dance.  This has moved way up my want list recently.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I rather liked this after the first play. It's very much an efficiency game at heart: you just need to come up with a plan on how to gather the goods necessary to tech up from the lowly 2-5 contracts as quickly as possible, and then ramp up from the midlevel contracts to high level, etc. It's not really an engine building game in the normal sense though.

The first game felt very interactive: you needed to constantly keep an eye on what everyone else was doing to steal their resources and cards, draft their moves, and make moves that they'd draft on. But the second game was just totally flat when it came to that, it felt like 4p solitaire. It might have been just a coincidence, but it fell of my to-buy list after that.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I really wanted to like this game, but something isn't clicking for me.  The main thing I don't understand is how this game isn't a 30 minute game.  The way that the game timer works seems so strange - the game should play much faster than it seems to take most people.  Either we're doing something wrong, or maybe just not thinking enough about the moves we're making.  

Still, I have hope and would like to play more in hopes of discovering some hidden layers beneath the surface.

Easy rules but still quite a few things going on and keep you engaged. I particularly like how you have to travel to various locations and pick up and then deliver goods while trying to fulfill different contracts. It is also interesting how you have to manage to get the goods refilled and when you want to travel minor or major locations. We think the game has a pleasant rhythm, and it is also quite competitive with the contracts and building cards. However, we did not buy a whole lot of building cards, we mainly concentrated on the contracts.
Somehow the game components and the rules evoke well the theme: trading, delivering and collecting goods.
The contract and bonus cards give the game a nice replayability. I hope further games will see us purchasing more building cards.
I love the cardboard boxes that hold the cubes in: I just put them back in the game box as they were on the table and can take them out in no time when we play next.

After only one play, this game is exactly what I like. I didn't find it dry or boring at all, actually thought it was very engaging. Lots of ways to score points and various strategies you can use so if one doesn't work, you can focus on another. Can't wait to play it again.
I know that it's new to me for now, but it is definitely one of my favorite Rosenberg titles.  LOVE.

This Uwe Rosenberg game isn't talked about much but it's very different from his other games. At the core it's a pick up and deliver and recape fulfillment game, but the system of fulfilling contracts adds a puzzle element of how to get the most return for each action. It plays pretty quickly at all player counts and the fact that you can follow other players actions (paying a cost) means that you are involved in other players turns.

Basic pick-up and deliver game with nothing really exciting or unusual about it.  The board is not very impressive with it's bland appearance, two-piece construction and cut outs for inserting the view obstructing cube boxes.  But I enjoyed the game and my 7 rating could go up with more plays.  Definitely much easier and lighter than Le Havre or Agricola.

RATING: N/A
I love this theme. And I love "Rosenbergs". So that will be the first game I'll look for at Essen 10.

update: Got to read the rules. It's a pretty pure and straightforward ressource/trade-in game. I hope it plays more fluent than Loyang.

update: Played it in Essen (thanks to Gregorz for a very good presentation) and I changed it from "want to buy" to "want to play". It's a very abstract game, which destroys the very nice theme that I was so keen about. It is still a very intelligent design (nothing other from Uwe is expected) but it's too analytical and academic for me. Maybe another theme would have been better. Something with engines or really funny stuff. The game itself is pretty dry now. Compared to Agricola it's missing theme, compared to Le Havre it's missing theme and the very obvious and transparent development of the game.

Bottomline: Very intelligent but too abstract for me. I'm waiting for another play, a lot of other reviews and a bunch of strategy articles before I vote or buy.

Not your typical Rosenberg game.  I'd say this is the fastest of the notoriously long games from this designer (Agricola, Le Havre, Ora, Loyang) which is a big plus.  Fairly tactical this game has a concealed depth under deceptively simple mechanics.  You can also play this without thinking too much, which will wield reasonable results and is a plus for accessibility.  It's not as epic, not as strategic, but much more playable and with a similar "taste" to Le Havre (without buildings & building actions).  Some people will tell you that it's purely tactical and that you cannot really plan but its deeper than it appears.

LIKE:

* The little wagons for the cubes were a nice aesthetic addition which work well on a practical basis too!
* The need to try and develop deliveries and purchase combos is interesting to puzzle and solve.
* The time tokens which are used to be able to take additional actions on opponents' turns are a nice touch to keep people interested.  

DISLIKE:

* Except for time tokens, this game is largely a solitaire puzzle.
* There is a fair bit of luck of the draw involved in the contract draw.
* Special buildings can get gummed up if all 4 are high cost buildings.
* Game just doesn't feel all that inspired after Agricola and Le Havre.  I may even prefer Loyang over this one.

RATING: 5
Egy játék alapján:
Elsőre bonyolultnak tűnik, de az első játék végére minden letisztul, összességében könnyen tanulható. Különösebben előre tervezni nem lehet benne, legfeljebb a következő körig lát el az ember (addigra úgyis felveszik a többiek a szerződéseket/épületeket/bónuszokat/árucikkeket), de a többiek játéka közben folyamatosan lehet módosítgatni fejben, hogy mit fogok majd csinálni.

A játékosok közötti interakció elenyésző. Direktben időjelzőket adunk néha a másiknak, illetve indirekt módon lehet hatni még a többiekre: felvenni előlük a lapot/árut, ami nekik nagyon jól jönnének. Ez szerintem kevesebb interakció a kelleténél, fekete pont.

A játék kinézete megfelelő, csúnyának semmiképpen nem nevezhető, a játékelemek minősége kiváló. Viszont vannak itt is fekete pontok: a játéktábla két különálló, egymás mellé tett kartonlapból áll, ami szerintem sokkal rosszabb megoldás, mintha egy nagy, kettéhajtható kartonlap lenne. Az árutartó ládikók hasznosak, azonban alacsony szögből nézve eltakarhatják a játéktábla egy részét, illetve nem kényelmes a kis kockákat kiszedni belőle: néha nehéz megfogni őket. De ez apróság.

A játék erőssége a sokféle választási lehetőség: melyik országba vigyem a kereskedőt? Ez főleg attól függ, hogy milyen szerződéseim vannak nekem, és milyenek a többieknek: az én hasznom maximális, a többieké minimális legyen a kiválasztott országgal. Vegyek-e bónuszlapot vagy épületlapot, ha igen, melyike(ke)t? Melyik szerződést adjam el, melyiket tartsam meg? Kövessek-e másokat? Nyilván csak akkor, ha az én hasznom értékesebbnek tűnik, mint a követésért cserébe neki adott időjelző.
Elég összetettnek tűnik ez a lehetőség-háló, és nagy előnye, hogy nem látszik egyetlen kikristályosodó nyerő stratégia, hanem mindig az adott helyzethez kell alkalmazkodni, abból a legtöbbet kihozni, profitot maximalizálni. Illetve, hosszabb távú célokat adnak játék közben az épületek, mert ha már megveszek egyet, hasznát is akarom venni: pl. ha nálam van a legtöbb időjelzőt birtokoló játékost jutalmazó épület, akkor érdemes arra is figyelnem, hogy a játék végén sok időjelzőm legyen. Elég sok ilyen lap van, ez jó. Persze, egyetlen játék csak a mechanizmus megismerésére volt elég, a mélységeiről nem lehet megalapozottan beszélni, de nagyon úgy érzem, hogy vannak neki.

A játék nagy fekete pontja az én szememben, hogy túl száraz (de még így sem annyira, mint a Power grid). Nagyon lehet élvezni a legkedvezőbb cselekvés kiválasztásának folyamatát, de még sokkal jobb lenne, ha nem érződne közben ennyire a játék szárazsága. A mechanizmusok és a téma nem elég szorosan kapcsolódnak. Például meg lehet ugyan magyarázni, hogy miért kell az öt darabon túli szerződéseimet eladnom a kör végén, de nem túl meggyőző. Sem az időjelzők szerepe. Sem hogy valamelyik raktárból el kell dobnunk valamit, ha az utolsó időjelzőt húzzuk fel. Sem, hogy időjelzőket adunk másoknak követéskor. Sem, hogy időjelzőket kapunk ha közeli országokba megyünk kereskedni. Nekem kicsit fura az is, hogy egyetlen közös kereskedőbábut irányít az összes játékos, hogy nem számít, hogy hol van épp a kereskedő-jelző, bárhonnan bárhova el lehet jutni, és mindig a célország fix árát kell megfizetni az utazásért. Értem én, hogy tulajdonképpen mindig visszatér a kereskedő Hamburgba, de erőltetettnek érzem, főleg, hogy a térképen ezt semmi nem jelöli, nem kell a kereskedőt a kör végén visszamozgatni oda.

Tetszik, hogy még épp átlátható mennyiségű játékelem kerül csak a játékosok elé, pont nem veszik még el köztük az ember, akkor sem, ha a játékostársai lapjait nézi. Tetszik, hogy nyílt lapokkal játszunk, mindenki láthatja a többiek pontos helyzetét, így gondolkodni lehet a másik fejével is, hogy ő valószínűleg mit is fog majd csinálni...

Összességében, egy játék után: bőven van a játékosnak döntési lehetősége, ami elsőre túl soknak is tűnhet, de a második-harmadik játékra már valószínűleg könnyen és gyorsan kiválaszthatja mindenki, hogy mit is tegyen, ami a leginkább szolgálná az aktuális célját. Elég nagy lehet az újrajátszhatósága, csak hát kicsit száraz. Ez a szárazság az, ami sokakat elriaszthat az első játék után, de amin túl kell lendülni, mert szerintem néhány játék után ez megszűnne érződni, és maradna egy gondolkodós, élvezetes játék, amiben emberi elme küzd emberi elme ellen: hogy melyikünk tud egy kicsit gyorsabban fejlődni, több pontot összegyűjteni a játék végére. Ez kihívás, minden alkalommal.

Played once with 4. 

At first you have this total random mess of a game. What you don't realize is that your first goals should be to gather bonus cards and building cards to determine which contracts are most important to you.

Evaluating which contracts are worth retaining for continues revenue generation combined with timely culling of the chaff will allow you to collect further bonus and building cards. 

In the end it was rather surprisingly strategic, though your strategy starts to materialize mid game, yet there is still plenty of time to see them to fruition. You simply have to ensure that while you try to maximize building cards that you continually evolve your contracts for the maximum points at the end of the game.

It's also surprisingly short. It was 90 minutes including rules explanation for our first play. So Uwe has returned to a reasonable play time again.

RATING: 7
I think Merkator got a bad rap initially because it's a rather different style of game to the three "Harvest Trilogy" games that Uwe Rosenberg designed before it. There's no engine building here; instead, we've got a rather intelligent pick-up-and-deliver game. Sure, the theme is loose to the point of absurdity, and sure, Klemenz Franz's artwork suffers when he gets away from his signature comic cartoon style, but that's all irrelevant for the simple reason that THIS IS A DECENT GAME.

Play time is fairly short, but this is is a good thing as it means there is just not enough time to do everything. Every turn involves nail-biting decisions, and players need to be dynamic. The fluctuation of cubes on the board, and the cycling of contract cards, mean that the same move a turn later can have a considerably different outcome. Long-term strategies are possible, but this is ultimately a primarily tactical game. Therein lies another strength of this game though: it is incredibly easy to teach, particularly given the depth it offers.

Nevertheless, the game doesn't see much play in our house; probably because it's up against some stiff competition in the 45 minute game category; I'd probably rather play a Stefan Feld design.

Good impression after out first two games, once with the standard and once with the longer game. The latter felt a lot more involved without being that much longer, so I'd treat the short, easy option as a learning game.

There is a lot of subtle and not-so-subtle interaction here, and I feel that anticipating the plans of your opponents will become as important in an experienced group as developing your own strategy.

Learning what kind of contract cards can crop up is probably necessary to be really successful in Merkator, at least for the last crucial steps towards the Westphalia Peace contract.

The only possible complaint is that the card order can have a strong impact on the game, especially for the building cards - if something nice comes up at exactly the right moment, this can be a decisive boost for you.

9-5-14-Definitely  favorite game.  Today's game was over in 40 minutes.  And that was with both of having a little AP at the end!  

5-18-14-Played once, loved it and immediately set it up to play again.  We loved the 2nd play, too, and this is really saying something from a guy who prefers game length of 30-45 min.  I was amazed at Miles' reaction!  It took us ~1 hr 45 minutes for each game.  I know it's early days but I'm starting this one out as a 10.  :)

5-17-14-Got this out today and set it up, then watched Rahdo's runthrough again.  We will be ready to play tomorrow!  Can hardly wait; looks like it's right in the sweet spot for us. :)

Not for the new gamer.  I think Uwe has another great game but I am torn by the implementation of it.  It's a great resource trading game that slowly builds on itself.  The mechanics are great.  However, it's hindered by the feel/appearance of the game.  It is strange because I can't put my finger on it, but I feel that if it had the same peppy design like Agricola with more engaging artwork; I think it wouldn't have this hurdle.  It's a great game that offers a number of strategy options, but it took a couple of games to get over the very apparent dry feeling of the board that hits you immediately.  It's not bad artwork either, so what is it?... is the game just cursed?

RATING: 7
Merkator is a chaotic, tactical, dry game of optimization/efficiency. I believe it is rated low on BGG because many on this site aren't fans of games for which these terms apply and/or because they had different expectations from a Uwe Rosenberg game.

This game is not heavy on luck. It is about managing chaos and timing/ordering your moves so that you:

1. Scoop the most and/or most valuable goods.
2. Complete your contracts at a time such that your new contracts mesh well with your existing contracts and bonus cards.
3. Piggyback on your opponents' movements (being able to pay a time or two to fulfill a contract is essentially a free turn for you).
4. Do not allow your opponents' to piggyback on your movements.

The two things that make the game most interesting are the piggybacking option and the hand management/push your luck aspect. Just how many contracts do you sell? Is it worth going for a high VP building card at the risk of not having a full hand of five contracts?

One thing I might change is having the starting hands (four contracts of values 2-5 and two bonus cards) come from a snake draft instead of being totally random. Additionally, I probably would only play with 2-3 players. With four, you would not be able to do any forward planning.

A common soundbite is that the opposite of love isn't hate, it's apathy.  And that's what Merkator gets from a lot of people -- apathy.  It's an optimization problem whose geographical soul has been abstracted into meaninglessness. Optimizing a cube-shuffling plan in the face of strongly chaotic factors (the board contents and available contracts will change a lot before your next turn) requires skills that you don't often see in the same game.

The only game I "must have" without knowing much about it except that it is designed by Uwe Rosenberg. Even the least of his trilogy of games so far (At the Gates of Loyang) is one of my favorite games, and Le Havre is possibly my favorite board game of all time.

Update: Got a chance to play. Liked it a lot. Although it's definitely the easiest of the Rosenberg board games to learn, it was definitely heavier than I expected. The mechanics are straightforward, but in a way the gameplay is almost the thinkiest of Uwe's games, given the many options you have per turn, combined with the level of forward thinking involved. 

In Agricola, it's relatively easy to have a back-up plan if the person before you takes what you need, but in Merkator, if someone screws up your plans you've gotta figure out a whole other multi-turned plan. Towards the end of the game it got quite brain-burner-y. Still, if you're in the mood for a game that requires heavy concentration, Merkator is a full meal.

RATING: 10
I have derived great enjoyment from my first ten games of Merkator. It is not helpful to compare it to Agricola, Le Havre, or Loyang. It is a completely original game in its own right. What do these games have in common? They are all about maximizing and manipulating resources in waves of abundance and scarcity. They all simulate various aspects of markets. However, the methods of play vary from worker placement to trading to pick up and deliver, linked to subtle infrastructures and randomness (the use of cards).
 I think they are all magnificent games suiting different ways of thinking and engaging with opponents. They are all aesthetically appealing. 

In some regards I find Merkator the most compelling of all, but I'll hold off on a "10" until I have more plays under my belt. Sure it's semi-abstract, but it is very beautiful to look at, and it has a subtle elegance about it. It is a very exciting and tightly balanced game. One third of our games have been settled by the time counter tiebreaker.

The more you play Merkator, the more you realize how strategic it is, especially with two players. I've had games where I just couldn't sync the contract fulfillment with any efficiency so I went to a pure building strategy. 
The bonus cards enable you to maximize your efficiencies based on what's available in the queue. The time counters are a fascinating resource that can have an important impact on your strategic choices. Of course there are many interesting tactical choices, too.

Merkator is also very flexible. We've appreciated the different ways of playing. 

I'd like to suggest that is a surprisingly elegant game, highly engaging and even exciting, with a fine rhythm and pace, and a thoughtful, innovative design.

If you've overlooked it because some have described it as dry, I suggest you give it a chance. It belongs in the same exalted category as Rosenberg's other economic games, even if it may not appear so at first glance.

Update: I've now played this over 100 times. Always different, interesting, and appealing.

The game is very interesting, the way you travel around getting different goods trying to fulfill contracts, getting Bonus for visiting certain locations, trying to create synergies between the contracts and the bonuses.

Also, the way that you can piggy back in the other players travels and fulfill contracts out of turn by paying some time is very cleaver.

Yes, it's not Uwe best game but it's a very good one!

Nothing new to offer, just another managing cubes game. It's not a bad game, but it's not also a good one. It is at the level of Loyand. My rating after one 4 player game and a solo game is 6. Maybe it could rise a little after another game.

The production have a lot of problems, cards are to thin, board keeps moving during the entire game, and the rulebook  paper looks like from a jornal. Really Bad components.

Another run with this game, just confirm my first experience. The appearance of the contracts are to random for you to get a real long time strategy, they seem to much out of control, and the buildings, well, you just pick them up because you have excess money in your pocket. It's a too much tactical game, you just get the better buildings of the four at display, without even knowing if you will score well or not with them. Just get as many as you can, they must score something at the end.
I thought that the game could improve in the second run, but it doesn't. To many things out of control in this game.

RATING: 5
Nothing really new. It is a well put together game that failed to excite me. Receive cubes from various locations  and deliver a combination of them to another location. There are building cards that help collect more cubes and bonus cards for endgame scoring. The selected locations in the game influence a time track by awarding time tokens. The tokens can be used by the players to get additional deliveries and/or a bonus cube at a location selected by another player. The deliveries fulfill contract cards and earn another contract card that has one more VP on it than the fulfilled one. These cards earn VPs at game end or must/can be discaded for money depending on whether their number exceeds 5/or not. Money can be used to buy building or bonus cards. The player interaction comes from picking a location with cubes or picking up contract cards that somebody else wants. It is much better and shorter, than the awful Loyang, but not nearly as good as Le Havre.

RATING: 5.5
--- Preliminary thoughts ---

This game it is exactly what we call in Spain "muevecubos" (cubes mover). You just move cubes around to score points. It's actually a race about who gets the most points. The theme implementation is very dry, you don't have almost any option, there's no long term planning at all, because you don't get to choose the contracts.

Yes, I know there's some strategy to it, but it's not enough. And the game doesn't offer any other interesting thing to me.

The "tag along" mechanic is nice, but it's not heavily used, it is just come secondary mechanism.

I wouldn't say it's a bad game, but it does feel quite insipid to me and I don't see myself willing to play it instead of others.

Cube juggling for filling tickets, stripped to the bare essentials. Some fascinating timing elements included but the point swings seem to be rather extreme. Probably gets quite quick after a few plays, but at that point the overall abstractness will have dropped my interest level so low that I'd rather play something else instead.

Gioco di mercato molto particolare in quanto completamente privo di contrattazioni tra giocatori o di acquisto. Questo risulta anomalo per titolo (mercato) e ambientazione riducendo un po' l'interazione. Il gioco tra l'altro non è ben ambientato: Italia, Bohemia e terre nuove, non producono materie prime (ce ne sarebbero molte) che invece vengono prodotte da Svezia, Russia e Spagna. Questa non cura dei dettagli e materiali formati da cubetti+cubetti+cubetti di tutti i colori riduce il tutto a prendi cubetti, usa cubetti quando forse si poteva più sfruttare l'ambientazione con il vino e l'olio italiano, le ceramiche boheme ecc.. In virtù della pesca delle carte (magazzini, contratti) il gioco risulta anche abbastanza soggetto alla fortuna e la necessita di fare delle combo potrebbe indirizzare la vittoria un po' casualmente. Malgrado tutte queste mie perplessità nel complesso il gioco non mi è dispiaciuto, probabilmente per l'ampia possibilità di gestire il proprio mercato, le proprie risorse e le nazioni con le quale stringere un rapporto di acquisto/vendita. Trovo si presti a diverse strategie anche se forse non è molto longevo. Le dinamiche sono semplici anche se solitamente la partita parte con una fase abbastanza lenta (dipende dai giocatori al tavolo) per poi accellerare negli ultimi turni.

The players take the role of 17th century merchants based in Hamburg: during the game they collect resources (cubes) and fulfil contracts to supply different map locations. Completed contracts lead to more valuable contracts, but there is a limit of five open orders which can be held at any time. Contracts in hand count for points at game end, and there are the usual bells and whistles for bonus points. There is minimal opportunity to affect other players- taking contracts or bonuses that might benefit them is about the limit. It is possible to piggyback on other players trade expeditions (this cannot be refused), so there is something to think about between your turns. Play was reasonably fast, and the decisions require enough thought to be interesting. But the game didn't really excite me- more plays required before a final decision.

I am a huge Uwe fan, so I was quite excited to try out his take on a pick up and deliver game.

Highlights:
- Plays relatively quick, I could see a 2 player game wrapping up in less than an hour with 2 experienced players.
- The rules are quite straight forward and simple, the game really is all about optimizing your trade routes (which I love).
- My son was able to pick this one up right away and do quite well.
- The time track, basically the players determine how long the game will last depending on which cities they visit.
- The ability to follow some one and get to fulfill a contract in that location.
- You increase the value of your contract when you complete one (complete a 4 contract and earn a 5); however you can keep contracts and fulfill them multiple times.
- Your contract is also currency, you are constantly having to choose between keeping valuable contracts or using them to by new bonus cards.
- Bonus buildings give you alternative ways to score vp.

This is a pick up and deliver game that is all about optimization, there is no route building to be had. So I can see how this game is not for everyone, but I love it and it has moved way up my wishlist.

The Ultimate Cube Pusher!! Whatever some demented person thinks of Euros, Merkator is probably what they envision. Yep, this game is just about pushing cubes from one side of the board to the other. But, honestly, this game is terrific. It's a bare bones pick-up and deliver game with contracts and destinations, complete with Old World graphics and names. And it's by the designer of Misery Farm and Bohnanza, Uwe Rosenberg. Seriously, that guy can do anything. The mechanics in the game are clean and uncomplicated and the strategy evolves every time I play. One of my favorite Euros.

Played terrible the first time I tried this one, but I think it has some interesting decisions.  The time capsule concept to visit different locations or tag along adds a little extra player interaction.  I love the little crates of goods, something about the components makes the game feel like more than a bunch of colored cubes.  I had a much better feel for the strategy at the end of the game and look forward to playing again to get a better grasp on the rating this game deserves.

After playing this a couple of times, I can say that I enjoy it. It is not a worker placement game, so it is not your typical Rosenberg design (which may explain the low ratings). I know some people don't appreciate the randomness but I don't think it is as random as some here would have you believe. Even if it is too random, there are optional rules to address it.

In the end, I suspect the low ratings have more to do with the expectations of the design than the design itself. If anyone other than Rosenberg had designed this, it might have higher ratings. However, since it is a Rosenberg design that has nothing in common with La Havre, Agricola or Caverna, my guess is that some gamers will reject it. However, I view it as an underrated gem.

There was a lot of like about this game, but the fiddling with the seemingly infinite number of cubes was less than thrilling.  The buildings were kind of odd, and it was difficult to smoothly get into the acquisition.  I only bought one building, but I wound up tieing on points for the game lead, as the one building I got was good for me.  

It took a bit for me to catch on to the difference between fulfilling a contract to earn a new contract and the selling a contract to raise money.  Intuitively, it seems that fulfilling the contract should give you money. While I think we all understood this mechanic, I don't particularly like it.

Based on one play: Nothing new here. You build an engine that allows you to collect larger and larger contracts. Move to a location to gather cubes and then fill your contracts with those cubes. The bonus point cards are tough to score since the game is fairly short, so you really need to find the best path based on your starting cards.

RATING: 7
The basic premise of this game is that you move to a city (the further from Hamburg, the more expensive it is), collect the cubes there, complete any contracts for there if you have the right cubes, and then allow your opponents to complete contracts for there as well.  Completing contracts give you not money, but instead, more complex contracts (if you want money, you'll have to sell off your older, less useful contracts).  There's a big trade-off between going to places with cubes you need and going to places where you can complete contracts, so ideally you'll want to get contracts in cities your opponents are likely to go, so that you can do them on their turns.  So really, there's a lot to pay attention to.  However, I found the game ended too shortly to formulate a good strategy, but maybe I'd be able to do more on future plays.

A satisfying contract fulfillment game, and the best game I've played so far from Essen 2010.  The rules sound confusing at first, but two turns into the game, you realize just how straightforward it is, and most turns can be made quickly.  

My biggest complaint is that the cards were poorly printed -- the blue cubes look purple on the cards (they are fine on the cardboard mats), which makes them difficult to tell apart from the true purple cubes.  This interferes with gameplay.  Lookout Games should get their money back from the card printer and print a new batch of cards.  I have no intention of buying the game until this is resolved.

RATING: 6
This is a pickup and deliver game that has the curious element of 'everyone shares the same pawn on the board'. You move the pawn to where you like, collect the goods on the spot, generate goods on the spots nearby, buy points cards and try to get the highest value set of contracts. I liked this one. One interesting element is each spot on the board produces one color of goods, which then separates into two types on your player board. Then each of those two types of goods also has a icon (food, weapons, clothing). The contract cards you buy reference all these things, so there are a lot of ways you can use your goods. Matching a solid route with getting new contracts that work into your combos is a really interesting challenge.

This is a fine economic game and a worthy addition to Uwe's catalog. That said it's probably the worst of the big four (Agricola, Le Havre, Loyang, Merkator) but is still a great game. That says something when the worst is still good. It's also very, very dry.

My wife discovered this game via the Rahdo runs through series and I am very glad she did. Unlike Uwe Rosenberg's typical worker placement, farm themed game, this game about merchant traders in the 30 years war plays very easily and well with any number of players(including the solo game). I really like the cube holders on the board since it caters to my need to have game components neat and tidy. I only wish the board was one foldable board instead of two separate pieces.

Elegant design, good depth for such simple rules. Resource acquisition and objective fulfillment. Like Le Havre, balance opportunism vs what you actually need as offer spaces (-- countries) pile up with resources. Long term planning to maximize the return on each turn (e.g collecting multiple contracts from the same location -- so you can fulfill multiple each turn) is one strategy, but building cards can change any game. Unlike the games in the Harvest Trilogy, Merkator feels semi abstract, no connection to the theme, and can be a bit fiddly when played quickly. But a good design nonetheless, and (most importantly) fun to play.

This is rated as a solo game since it's the only way I have play.  Yes, it's dry and there isn't much theme but for some reason this game is an enjoyable exercise or puzzle.  I can see this work pretty well with others too.  There is luck with card draw.  if a combination of cards comes up then many contracts in a turn can be turned thus giving you a ton of money to buy building the next turn.  I like the idea of two different resource with the same cube.  It has good decisions ans although it's a resource management type game it doesn't really feel like anything I've play before.  It has quick setup and tear down which is a plus for solo play.  Overall, a pleasant surprise of a game that I got relatively cheap and glad I have.

I felt very well inclined towards this game owing to the large number of coloured cubes; after playing I have discovered that I am absolutely delighted by Merkator, which is filled from the beginning with interesting decisions. In spite of the obvious cube-shuffling agenda, I was surprised to read the many negative comments here, deriding the dryness and lack of theme. I find that the time element and the yeah generally the whole way that cubes sorry goods and contracts are handling is nicely thematic, but horses for courses I suppose. Here's hoping that the disdain means that I will be able to pick up a copy on the cheap before too long. Trade for London, anyone?

This game is getting an undeserved bad rap. The game is tight and tense.

Don't get distracted by the bonus buildings, they are booby prizes for contracts you can't hold.

Fiddly (but what do you expect from Rosenberg these days?!) and surprisingly unimmersive.  The time mechanic was neat but not as clever as in e.g. Thebes, and the random "lose a resource at the end of a row" was horrendous.  
But it all fits together, and it runs surprisingly quickly once you know what you are doing, which means that if you screw up then it's going to be over quite quickly and you won't feel completely useless...

[i]Yo dawg, I heard you like spreadsheets, so we put more spreadsheets in your spreadsheet game, so now you can spreadsheet while you spreadsheet"[/i]

It's one of those games from the gaming club's closet nobody wants to touch, so I borrowed it to see what's the problem. My impression after 1 solo play:

After reading the rules the game seemed pretty ascetic and more or less about accounting with no actual interaction, but looked peaceful enough for a quiet night time solo session. Second impression was, ... the hell? Is this work, do I really have to optimise my way through this cubage? Third impression somewhat softened the previous - okay it's not so hard as it seems there's not much to decide about anyway (high random factors). 

However this is not a game. This is work. The Prussian soul of this game is neatly organized and decent enough to be socially acceptable, until it starts talking and then everyone dozes off or runs. On one hand I'm thankful that it's not a serious as it looks, then again it's not really better because of it. On the bonus side, this is not an everything but the kitchen sink euro VP salad that we've seen so frequently lately, no, this is a clean, efficient design that know what it wants to be and even makes some thematic sense. Only there's no fun included in the box. 

It's is a pastime accountants do, when they feel like doing something a bit different, but don't want to stretch their imagination too much.

Valahogy tipikus 7-es játéknak érzem a Merkatort. Ahogy játékostársaim is kifejtették jó játék, de letaglózó érzés nem érződik a partik után. A tábla és a játék elég absztraktra sikerült, kicsit száraz az egész. Tényleg egy tipikus eurogame, de érdekes mechanizmusokkal van tele. Egyrészt érdekes, hogy a különböző színű termékek két fajta nyersanyagot jelentenek, mikor beszerezzük és raktárba kerülnek döntünk róla, hogy melyik fajta legyen. Nagyon érdekes és nagyon tetszetős az idő megjelenése a játékban és nagyon jól eltalált ennek felhasználása az utazások során. A játékidő is jól eltalált, egyáltalán nem érzi hosszúnak az ember. Egy bármikor elővehető játékról van szó, amelyikből 1 partit nem nagyon utasít vissza az ember.

[2017-11-27]
6 év után a második játékra kicsit monotonabbnak éreztem és kicsit elnyújtottabbnak, igaz a játékosok tudják befolyásolni egy-egy játék végét, ezért ez lényegesen eltérő lehet partinkként.

We have the Uwe Rosenberg trilogy and they are favourites of both my family and my playing group - as i am writing this there is a game of Gates of Loyang setup on the dining room table to finish playing the next time my kids are here.  What I have read so far suggests that it is not as unique and theme-filled as those games but that it is still a very good game ... As one of my 2 favourite designers, I will stick with my belief that it will stil be a fun game until proven otherwise ... :D

Solid Uwe Rosenberg game, although I'd say it's most like Loyang with just a touch of Le Havre thrown in. I like having to try and plan how to get goods and where to fulfill contracts and it doesn't seem quite as crazy tight as Loyang or Agricola, although you do get the sense that there certainly are some unproductive moves. The two-player game should probably allow for each of you to join travels, as I think there's basically almost no interaction otherwise. 

UPDATE: I continue to enjoy this game more and more with each play, as I really like how quickly it plays while still letting you get a chance to get your Uwe fix.

UPDATE #2: Really enjoying this with 2. It plays super quickly, I enjoy moving the bits, and I still find planning things out a challenge to keep moving up the contract ladder.

UPDATE #3: The more I play it, the more I enjoy it. It's fast and satisfying in being able to fulfill that next contract, but challenging enough to decide how to chain your moves and if sometimes it's worth it to just take a pause to grab a ton of cubes.

UPDATE #4: Yup, finally made it to a 10, especially as a 2-player. Silly fast with tons of decisions and great nervous tension always propelling you forward.

Lots of cubes! Merkator is a fairly good game. Getting over the hurdles of fulfilling contracts for additional contracts (not money), and selling contracts (not goods) for money is the only part that isn't straightforward. The rest is just resource management and timing.

RATING: 7.5
This is a cool take on the pick-up-and-deliver mechanic, and feels TOTALLY different from any of his other big-box games (e.g., Agricola, Le Havre, At the Gates of Loyang). The pick-up-and-deliver is highly abstracted, but works very well. The reward system is pretty clever, too: successively get more valuable contracts in hand, which you also want to discard for their coin value (to buy buildings); but if you do so too early, you limit your contract-related VP potential!

After 1 play, a 7.5; could easily go up!

--- Summary ---
The board shows several interconnected locations, each with a stock of cubes in different colors (seeded at start) and each costing some amount of time chips (some locations give you chips). Resources are unique: every color can be one of 2 types; you must choose when you acquire the cube. There are also several contracts on display (each requiring a unique combo of cubes, and worth VP) and several building cards. Players start the game with some contracts in hand, as well as one of every resource. 

On your turn, you move a marker to any location and collect resources; add a cube to every connected location. You may also fulfill contracts for that location if you have the correct combo of cubes. You reward is to get a contract [i]of the next higher value[/i]. There is a hand limit, and you can return contracts to supply to earn coins (which are used to buy the building cards). 

At the end of the game, you earn VP for all the contracts still in hand, plus the building cards (which each have different requirements and VP values).

This is designed by Uwe Rosenberg?!  Most of his most popular designs share common themes and mechanics, even Bohnanza which is completely different from his usual worker placement fare still has you planting crops.  This is a straight up pick up and deliver economic game.  And it is fantastic!

It's so hard to look at this game and have any interest in playing it.  One of the most boring and bland box covers I've ever seen bars entry.  As soon as I learned it was designed by Uwe Rosenberg though (Agricola is my favorite game after all) I was able to get past the sleepy muted brown art.

In this game there are 16 different resources represented by 8 different colored cubes.  These cubes accumulate on interconnected spaces representing locations across Europe.  You collect these cubes to fulfill orders and each order you fulfill provides you with money as well as a more valuable and also more complicated/difficult order to fulfill.  This is all in service of buying point cards with the money you accumulate.

While the actual pick up and deliver mechanic of this game is refined to the basics, there are some very clever and original mechanics in this game that fill out the rest of it.  Each player has a personal economy, they cannot accumulate more than 16 coins through fulfilling orders so you have to be constantly spending money to not lose it when you fulfill orders.  The game also has several point cards that cost more than 16 coins, requiring you to sell orders to acquire them.  Orders themselves are worth points at the end of the game so about mid game you really have to do some mental acrobatics to ensure you're getting more for your money from the point bonus cards you're buying compared to what you are sacrificing.

The resources themselves are also done in an interesting way.  16 different resources is a lot to juggle and the fact that they are represented by only 8 different colors has you trying to figure out where to put your goods when you acquire them.  Also, time is another resource that sets the pace of the game.  Depending on the location you go to you will have to take more and more time off a board and when the last time tile is taken the game is over.  Players have a decent amount of control over the pace of the game in this way.

And from an aesthetic standpoint I love the look and feel of this game.  It actually comes with little trays you can assemble to hold all of your 8 different colored cubes and the rest of the cardboard is attractive, easy to read, and just has a nice flow to it so all the information is easily accessible and understandable.  The one gripe I have, which I've noticed is somewhat common is games with many different colored cubes, is the blue cubes on the cards and cardboard look purple and there is a purple/pink/fuchsia colored cube as well so this can get a bit confusing.

Don't let the extremely boring box cover fool you, it does a huge disservice to this game that has a lot of life and is incredibly interesting.  At the same time, don't let the designer's name on the box fool you either, especially if you don't like pick up and deliver games.  This is not standard worker placement harvest Rosenberg fare but it is still an amazing pick up and deliver economic game.

How boring can a game be? At this point Uwe is one of my favorite designers mainly because of Agricola and Le Havre. That's not new really since he has become the favorite designer of many other players because of these games also. But I have to say that Merkator is not a game I want to play more. It's very, very dull and boring. I pass this one!

It's unreasonable to expect the designer to reprise the two best games released in the last 4 years (gric & le havre).

However, that has not stopped me feeling disappointed with Loyang and Merkator.

Merkator is a fine pick up deliver/efficiency game. The design is slick and intelligent without being compelling. Like Loyang this is not one for AP with the game  play in a constant state of flux.

I'm just not a fan of those basically themeless games where you trade cubes and try to think like a calculator. Since I'm not too crazy about Le Havre and Goa and such, I guess it's no surprise I don't especially like this.

Get cubes, invest, earn VPs. The separation of cube getting to cube spending echoes Macao a bit, but Merkator lacks the sense of progression of Macao as the game evolves.

It would have got a much higher rating - perhaps even comparable to Le Havre if it had nicer artwork, graphic design and components. The minimalistic cube pushing nature of the aesthetics makes the game feel drier than it is.

The first play wasn't easy. Not that the rules are hard, I just didn't have a good idea of how to score points, which is the goal of the game of course. I think I did OK, but the one player who had played before, just murdered all of the other games. But that's OK, it's an intriguing design and I want to play again. I can see this score going up with repeated plays.

This is a very dry game though, just wanted to point that out.

Initial rating: 7.2

I like that Rosenburg has crammed some interactivity in here; you probably want to pick up contracts for locations where other people are planning on heading to and presumably you also want to be collecting goods before other people head to collect them. And yet the game still feels incredibly heads-down solitaire.

It reminded me quite a bit of Navegador where you need people to be doing the opposite of what you're doing so that your engine works efficiently.

A clever, solid game but not one that I really ever had fun playing.

This game felt very meh.  It was one of the first along the lines of quick play, limited decisions, drive everyone to close scores, and not a lot of time to separate yourselves to tell a story.

This is a pick-up-and-deliver game, but with a lot of interesting things going on that come together to form a very good game.  The game is quite tactical, since you don't know where the other players are going to go, and that determines where the resources will be by the time your turn rolls around.

My favourite of the games I played in Essen 2010. The feeling is similar to Le Havre - there are so many opportunities to optimize something but you can't have everything! Plays much quicker than Le Havre, though, and seems more elegant because it has fewer rules and elements.

RATING: 4
Following the brilliant Agricola and Le Havre, Uwe Rosenberg continues to barrel down the wrong path with game like At the Gates of Loyang and Merkator. Merkator is a droll affair where players stop at German cities to pick up resources and fulfill contracts. It's more a puzzle than a game. Worse, it allows negotiation, as you can get resources and fulfill contracts when other players visit certain cities, ensuring the game is not only boring but also drawn out with bartering. I'd love to see Uwe get off the bean trader redux kick and get back to designing gems like Agricola and Le Havre.

Despite there aren't many options at hand this one can be quite a brainburner. However, it seems as if it is over too soon. We had one building each (two players) in a deck of 26 buildings. Money is really scarce and buildings are extremely expensive.Apart from the fix-pointed buildings, buying them based on a tactical decision doesn't make sense because they will only pay off if you decided for a strategy to pull for. And you can't be sure that this strategy willwork out in the end. Solid game after all, but not remotely close to exciting.

An interesting take on pick-up and deliver with a significant tableau building portion. I watched Rahdo's run through where he was like, "Synergy, synergy, synergy!" but it felt more like chaos, chaos, chaos. Just a very hard game to plan ahead in with very few ways to build synergy in your tableau if the cards you need aren't showing up.

RATING: 7
Score is as an interesting little solo puzzle of trying to figure out the optimal path through a fairly complex series of logistics opportunties to come out with points at the end. Feels a little like Glass Road solo in that sense. I'll play it again solo but I fear for a game that's about efficiently executing on geographical contracts, I wouldn't rather play something like Africana against other people (to avoid infinite-thinking-time problems)

RATING: 4
I can see the glimmer of some clever ideas in here, but the whole is much less than the sum of its parts and ultimately uninspiring.  Somewhat of an economic engine game, but there is far too little control of what is available to create your engine to give it any appeal.  I've heard that it is playable with 2, but 3 was fairly miserable and I can only imagine that 4 would be disastrous.

After our second play we really liked the game; the first play didn’t satisfy us. But with the longer game it became more epic and felt like we could accomplish all the things. We’ll definitely play the long game in the future, and as two players we’ll probably even play an extra long game by filling the whole 4-player board.

The illustration and component quality are great and the little storage bins for the cubes are a fantastic idea.

RATING: 8
Nicely designed goods acquisition and contract fulfillment game. The contracts are plentiful and can change rapidly, causing just enough chaos to force plenty of flexibility. Although there are player boards, there is plenty of interaction due to the ability of others to tag along to your destination and compete for the same goods that you might be after.  This is my favorite Uwe Rosenberg design so far.

RATING: 7
This game plays very differently from how most games play. It might be pretty good but I have to play it again a time or two before settling on a solid opinion. 7 is where it is for now -- at least initially, the balance of building cards and the timing of when time counters run out versus when people are likely to complete the 10 contract seems weird.

This is a nice game.The rules are a little "loose" for my taste and there is less control in the new contracts than what I would have liked. But, a fine game nevertheless.

RATING: 8.5
It's a cube pusher for sure.  But unlike other games of it's ilk, contracts aren't a one time shot.  Planning which contracts you'll likely get, which cubes will be coming out, and when and where to go next is deliciously complicated.  Thematically and artistically it's a little dry.  But a very solid game.

RATING: 6
[thing=39684][/thing] is a fine euro economic game. Players went around the board to collect goods or fulfill orders. One order done makes the player receives another one, more difficult to fulfill. There special cards and players can use "time" to travel with others.

All in all, a solid game, with nice bits (the boxes to keep the cubes are great).

There is just isn't all that much that takes [thing=39684][/thing] above other good economic games. But it the mechanical engines work well enough here.

Provisional rating, one play.

RATING: 4
 It seems to me that Merkator could have used more time in the oven. The myriad of 'variants' strike me as a lack of commitment to a final game product and accordingly the game feels half baked.

To elaborate, the mechanics suggest that you could analyze all the information in an attempt to make choices that incentivize other players to further your goals, but the randomness of the contract draws and chaos of the replenishment system seems to undermine the motivation to engage in any significant level of analysis. Without this analysis, however, the game is just a fiddly overwrought mid-weight logistics game. 

I could see this getting better with more familiarity, and given the original ideas in here I'm motivated to at some point revisit this game. However, with so many other games vying for my attention this might not make it off the shelf for some time. In fact, I haven't gotten rid of it mostly because my box got damaged.

Merkator is not what you'd expect at all from Uwe Rosenberg, as there are no effect chains or resource conversions. It feels more like a Stefan Feld game, except instead of a point salad mini-games you get a fairly straight forward racing game. Completing shipping contracts gets you bigger contracts, which become more difficult to fulfill, as you work your way up the ladder...the players end up racing to be the fastest one to complete the final contract.

It's very simple to learn, but extremely deep once you get some experience. The most efficient path is not always obvious and even if it is, you often have to rely (or cajole) the other players to get you where you need to be.

This is probably Uwe's most under-rated game.

This is a solid gamer's game.  Use the optional rule where you don't discard a random good at the end of a timeline and you've pretty much got a no-luck game where you need to think ahead on how to fill your contracts.  Plays out at just the right time with 4 and doesn't overstay its welcome.  Solid Euro but I wouldn't put it in the family category.

unfortunately this game is a working mechanism of moving cubes from one place to the other of the table. get cubes, give cubes away. There is surely some strategy involved but it fails completely when it comes to involve a person. actually, it is pretty boring.

I think this game hits a lot of the same notes as Glass Road, except without the gimmicky resource conversion wheels. (I love the wheels, but they are definitely a gimmick.) Once the components are sorted and bagged, setup is quick. The rules are simple and easy to learn, and play is smooth, particularly the solo version. The main flaw is that the board art is not very attractive (though certainly functional).

Tentative rating based on one play: [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] — Because I dove into the first game without taking the time to analyze the way it all cascaded and worked, I had a hard time comprehending how to be competitive.  That said, my opponents thought (from looking at my current contracts) that I could have been contending for the win, rather than far in last place (with about half their scores), because I had the highest contract out of everyone.  This was quick, and I'm itching to play it again, because while I don't think I "get it" yet, I do think I have a much better sense of things to try next time.  I am guessing this game will end up being an [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] for me, because I really like the mechanisms and the challenge in this.

Oh, and the first edition [b]really[/b] needs a frame to go around the boards, holding them together, because the "built-in" storage bins mean the split board is constantly bumped around while people dig for the bits they need.  The installed storage bins are a great idea, especially that you take the player summaries and such out of the holes (very efficient), but needed a little more to make them work.  Also, I agree with Paul Grogan that it is most unfortunate that the locations are represented by frames with all their information therein... and then you're supposed to cover that information with cubes.  I would (and perhaps shall) go a step farther than Paul did, and put the name, the time cost, and the tag-along time cost [b]outside[/b] the square, leaving only the cube type indication inside the box, since as it's covered, it's replaced by that very same kind of cube.  [imageid=838456]

One final gripe about the production in the first edition:  There is some warping that occurred with the player boards, even though they look like they're done the same way as the [thing=31260][/thing] boards.  Because their backside isn't an alternate display of the same information (like [person=11507][/person] did with [thing=31260][/thing] and [thing=39683][/thing]), you can't just flip it over.  So, I sat there the whole game with my board wanting to spin.  It certainly doesn't wreck the experience, but it was disappointing.

I'd love to see these kinks worked out for a second edition, so I can buy this with pride, and feel my money is not only going to great people for a great game, but is also spent on a quality end product.  As it is, I intend to buy this, once its price is like [thing=39683]Loyang[/thing]'s has become ([b]half[/b] what folks were charging for it right after Spiel), and then print up one or more alternate boards for it, which is a shame, because I adore the [b]concept[/b] of the installed bins.  That, or I make a frame for it, and cut out overlays to make the board's layout more functional for play.

Oh, and then there's the small mistake with the Alsterhaus.  Come on, excellent second edition!  ;)  (But that means I need everyone else to be sure the first edition sells out. :ninja: )

Indeed, on a second play, with my wits about me to play strategically, this has risen to an [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b], and may yet rise a little more.  Excellent game, but surfing the card opportunities can be tricky!

As for solitaire play, as with [thing=39683][/thing], the solo game involves delightful, torturous mechanisms that aren't in the multiplayer game, making it a different experience that will make my eyes light up with images of [thing=39684][/thing] when I'm left alone....

[b]Update:[/b]  You can easily combat the board warpage by facing the boards toward each other before putting them back in the ribbon loop, and load the rest of the bits atop them.  Mine all sit quite flat now!

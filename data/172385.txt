This one is going to be a hit, I think. Ran demos of it at BGG.Con, and while the individual actions themselves are extremely simple, the spatial element and the race for building cards and valuable spaces produces some serious emergent gameplay and creates a lot of interesting decisions. It his a very sweet spot with just a little brain burn, gives you a very tactile sense of creation and progress, and looks GREAT on the table.

At first glance, it seems like a family game but it's fairly complex in terms of trying to make the most of your moves. A limited number of options for what you can do on each turn but you know what will be available over the course of each round and can plan ahead.

K&K are like the Woody Allen of board games, and another year brings another solid yet uninspired entry. I can't see myself playing this again over their much better games.

RATING: 4
Buy building materials in several colours, build towers in single colours to score vps.  The game has three currencies; cash, torches that allow extra actions, and rolling pins (influence tokens).  A host of cards provide a variety of benefits and scoring bonuses.  Player interaction is limited to taking building blocks or occupying a building space ahead of an opponent.  This being a Kramer and Kiesling design it is polished and entirely competent.  It also feels like a soulless exercise in the efficient use of actions and resources.

Production quality is very good.  While the artwork is quite pleasing, I felt as though the buildings representing the four different areas could have been more clearly differentiated.

RATING: 6
I wanted to like this one, I really did, but the gaming of experience of playing this one was simply lacking in fun.  In particular, this game lacks elegance or smoothness in play; the game kind of clunks along in fits and starts as your pieces go round and round an inner rondel type area, and small towers are built on haphazardly designated squares in the four quadrants of the board, with each quadrant having different end-game majority considerations. Yawn.

This is the kind of design that might have been both acceptable and popular ten years ago; but about now, a game design like this, primarily focused upon going around in circles, and building things on a board, for multiple area majorities, feels stale and dated.  

And yes, the game plays -it runs - it card flips - it goes in circles - but it utterly lacks joy, elegance, magic, cleverness or innovation. 

Bottom line:  this game feels like a chore, performed by players, such that by the end of the chore, one of the players has the distinct honor of being christened "the winner of the chore."

There is nothing particularly innovative or ground-breaking with Porta Nigra, but the game has an appeal and charm customary to what Kramer and Kiesling usually bring. I tend to notice their designs; so naturally I was lured to this one.

The set collecting, the race for area majorities and the tight gameplay leaves food for thought in a game that seemed to induce analysis paralysis in our first outing, but quickly settled into standard Euro fare.

This felt a lot like a Kiesling and Kramer game. Unfortunately for me, that isn't nearly as appealing as it once was.

December 2017 - fairly straightforward ruleset but the scoring of points can get quite creative.  Money can  be tight at points and that can affect what you can do.  I enjoyed this one as it allows you to be creative.  Playing with two allowed more playspace.  Playing with 3 or 4, man, less turns and space can get quite tight on the board.  That would add more of a race to build tension to the gamee.

Another in the long line of pretty bland Euros that don't do much to distinguish themselves, but are still somewhat enjoyable.

In this one, you'll play an action card from your hand each turn that allows you to get money, gather building materials (which you'll need that money for), build stuff (which you'll need those building materials for), and get scrolls (which you can buy cards that do a variety of different things).

Of course, you score points for building stuff, and there's an area majority game you're playing with all these buildings for end game scoring. You'll also score bonus points for building certain things in places at specific times, so there's a timing element to your building.

Not a bad game, but nothing that makes it stand out either. Would play if others wanted to play.

This game is well designed! It was very easy to learn; the rule book was well laid out and easy to read.  The components are good and the artwork is fantastic.  The tower pieces are fun to build.  Porta Nigra has a fair bit of strategy and is actually quite a "thinky" game.  The game play took a fair bit of time to play but I think this will shorten with multiple plays.  Negatives for me: exchanging the coins - 5's for 1's - is tedious; it also gets a little annoying moving the horses around in circles over and over.  Over all though, this game is fun to play - another good game design by Wolfgang Kramer and Keisling. Glad I picked this one up.

A run-of-the-mill euro with little fun or sense of accomplishment. The end result doesn't look as spectacular as I hoped. The theme is there, but the horsemen running around clockwise feels artificial. Ends in a typical point salad style with an AP ridden final round.

Yet another tower building game in the vein of Firenze or Asara.   I think I prefer both of those because they are a little shorter.   The 14 scrolls that are available each turn tend to slow the game down, although they are relatively simple to grasp.   While money felt a little tight, the availability of brick-buying actions felt even tighter.   The 4 different mini-games are all variations on the same idea.   I kind of wish those were a bit more interesting.   All in all, I would play this again certainly, but wouldn't suggest it over Asara or Firenze.

RATING: N/A
Great game! I love how there are different types of majority scoring in just one game. The idea where all players have the same deck but the random draw of your cards dictates your action is kind of cool.

With only two rounds, it really is a tense game, but it was a lot of fun. The intermediate scoring, whether you decide to split between VP, money or both is critical and fun at the same time.

The artwork is gorgeous and how the end game is shaped with all the different towers are pretty to look at.

Love it!

2015-11-17 : It's always a joy to play a streamlined, well-crafted game and that's the case here - the game is tight, with everyone always competing for the same resources and cards and jockeying for position on the various majority tracks. The only negative is that the game is mainly tactical and that you can't plan ahead really well because the player(s) before you will change the situation on the board too much. This results in the game taking slightly longer than it should have.

Minor rules hole : which colors get filed if the builder card requires 4 and there are only 3 blocks left ? We went with lower price colors getting filled first.

I really enjoy this game despite it could takes more than 2 hours long if you play a 4 players game (worse with new players). The are many possibilities for great strategies. The only bad thing is the color of the brick, which is gray, instead of the four colors of the game. But I understand the constraint for the price and the number of bricks necessary. I still recommand it. J'adore ce jeu. Il faut être très stratégique pour accumuler le plus de points sur chacune des quatre constructions. Malgré que les cartes d'actions sont les mêmes que l'on joue à deux reprises (à trois reprises à 2 joueurs), les possibilités sont grandes puisque les torches supplémentaires peuvent être jouées à tout moment. Je le recommande.

RATING: 6
From K&K who made [thing=129948][/thing]. Instead of rotating a wheel as in PoC, you ride your horse in a clockwise manner around the market to buy colored bricks to build parts of the city (and claim bonuses). There are very limited spaces for bricks to go, and there are very limited bonuses for when you do build, so like Carrara, you have timing decisions. You have to spend wisely to accumulate bricks and spend them before others do. It's very much a "get there first" game which generally I like.

To add in a layer of difficulty, you draw 2 cards from your action card deck each turn and can play one of them. So, you can't always count on doing what you want depending on which 2 action cards you draw.  

I have to separate my play from the game. I had an annoying play of it as things just didn't break right for me. So I was constantly having to make a new plan at the start of my turn which meant all the planning I'd been doing was useless. After several iterations of plans, I was completely annoyed by the game. I mean, there's fun planning in games and there's frustrating planning, and I found it to be the latter. I was constantly having to make a new plan, and you can't do much planning till it's the start of your turn (which slows the game down).

Or maybe that was just how it felt on a first play for me, but I didn't find it fun. It's not a bad game just not one that I like nearly as much as Carrara.

I'll be honest. This was a blind buy at Essen. Just because it looked pretty and it was at the same booth as 504 ;)

When I read the rules in ths hotel, I was worried. It seemed like it was going to be a game where you don't get to do much. It seemed slow and not interesting enough.

Yet, I decided to try it the same night at the hotel game room. It was easy to find 3 people willing to try it. Rules explanation lasted 20 minutes and were good to go.

The game was a blast! It played very fast (80 minutes) and we had a lot of important choices and a lot of tension!
We also did a lot in the game, since we managed to build almost all 90 bricks.

My thoughts after this first game is that it is a simple, yet very clever optimization game.
Cannot wait for my next play :)

This one went down really well, especially with my wife who absolutely loves it. 

It definitely feels like a K&K game.  It felt a little like Carrara (Rondel, Coloured block purchase) meets Asara (Card play, purchase of coloured tower sections).  Perhaps a refinement of the two!

One of my better math trades I think

After a cursory rules reading and an explanation I was a little worried that Porta Nigra was a point salad game of Feldian proportions instead of the slick K&K design I was looking for. Fortunately, that didn't turn out to be true in practice. Even though the scoring seems a bit convoluted at first, it is quite organically embedded in all the building action on the board.

If I am still not entirely happy with the game that is because of two different properties: First, the game is pretty much entirely tactical. On any given turn try to maximize the scoring potential for the current board state. The final majority scoring is quite important but there are so many areas to compete in that even this preparation for the end of the game is dominated by opportunistic point grabs instead of long-term considerations. Second, considering this short-term focus, the game simply runs a little long. I can see why it does last as long as it does (otherwise most of the majority scoring would be fairly pointless) but it might be overstaying its welcome just a tad.

Besser als gedacht präsentiert sich PORTA NIGRA als einer der besseren Kramer/Kieslings der doch durchschnittlichen vergangenen Jahre seit ASARA. Die Grandseigneurs der Branche zeichnen auch im Trier der Römer das Spieldesign mit der von ihnen gewohnten soliden Handschrift, schaffen es aber in diesem Bauspiel in Höhe und Breite eine knackige, taktische und zeitliche Ballaststofflichkeit hineinzubringen, die durchaus die Decke biegt. Kann man als okayes, schlusswertungsmassiges Spätwerk im Herbst des Spieleautorenlebens durchaus eine Zeit lang in der Sammlung stehen lassen, wenn man noch Platz hat für den wuchtigen Karton.

Nicely designed game with a nice balance of in game and end game scoring(a la Stone Age).  Does not have the fun dice chucking and components of the aforementioned.  Bricks are the same grey color and stand ups? yuk.  Still it looks decent towards the end of the game but the fun factor, for whatever reason, is lower than expected.  Clever use of action cards, though, and I hope to see that mechanic return in a game that is more interesting.  Not as fun as many other K&K games.  Not bad really, but quite forgettable.

Play 1 of 7 cards and take 2-3 actions listed on that card, including buy bricks, build in an area, get money, get scrolls (bonuses and extra actions), and get torches (extra card actions). The main thrust is to build in four areas in order to score for majorities, which work differently for each area. Building in areas could earn you score-multiplying cards and/or a bonus if building three bricks in one area.

Classic, straightforward, middle of the road euro from two of my favs Kramer & Kiesling. I'm happy to play but probably don't need to own it.

PROS
-Component quality is good.
-Clever workaround for making all the bricks gray but denoting their color through their position on the board or in your player board.
-Downtime is minimal as the actions are pretty simple.
-I like the mid-game decision where players choose to split up their winnings in VP and money a la Princes of Florence and several other games.

CONS
-Not a deal breaker but the game has fiddly bits out the ears with three rows of cards, torches, scrolls, money, player cards, player discs, and, of course, blocks.
-Also not a deal breaker but sometimes I felt frustrated that I couldn't buy bricks. This is one of those niggling limitations of the player cards but it feels like there should be some kind of workaround, even if it comes at an exorbitant cost.
-Randomness in the order you get your cards. (Maybe play a variant where players start with all their cards and use them when they want?)
-Randomness in the brick market as it only gets refilled when the number goes under seven.
-Turn order may play too large a role in how well you execute your plan. (Would it have been better if all the cards were numbered 1-7 and turn order was determined what number card you play?)
-Seems like their really isn't much strategizing: you play a card that you drew, try to build as much and as high as you can to maximize points and hope the game goes in your favor. Playing white blocks in white spaces, esp. in Porta Nigra, is the obvious move for earning the most VP. This point above all others makes me think that I don't need to own this game.

Porta Nigra is "the building game" in my collection. It was also the first game I owned that included the rondel mechanism, but what I really enjoy about the game is seeing the city form as you play the game, and how the board is designed so that each section of the city actually looks something like the physical structures its meant to represent once the game is completed.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another solid design from Kramer & Kiesling, but I found it more abstract and less fun than usual. The action selection process uses both a rondel with construction blocks in different "colors", reminding me of "The Palaces of Carrara", and cards with various possible actions. (Actually, all blocks are gray, with colors being determined by their position on the main board or player boards.) There are also special cards and multiple ways to score, combining majorities and set collection. Everything works, but the game feels heavier than it should be, requiring too much mental effort for the amount of randomness.

While I like most games from Kramer and Kiesling, I expected more from this one. It's still a decent game, but there's really nothing new at all, while it doesn't combine things better than other, older games.

Reminds me of "Firenze" which is simpler and yet more engaging.

Even though I don't mind it, the added luck can decide a game and since you can't plan much ahead, it just doesn't feel that good.

Short: Ok game, but both designers have made much better games before, while this one doesn't offer anything new.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: euro de majories i gestió de recursos. Es tracta de construir edificis en un taulell dividit en 4 sectors. Cada edifici demanda un tipus diferents de recursos i et donen un nombre diferents de PVs. El mecanisme de selecció d'accions és mitjançant una baralla de cartes on apareixen diferents icones de les accions i has d'escollir entre elles un nombre (que també apareix a les cartes). A més, hi han bonus per construir a certs sectors utilitzant certs recursos (surten X cartes de bonus cada ronda) que al final es puntuen com a "set collection". Al final de la partida els jugadors que més edificis tenen a cada sector també puntuen PVs extra.

Poc innovador, molt sec i sense gairebé res interesant. Com a molt el mecanisme de selcció d'accions, però tampoc afegeix gaire... Descartat al 100%.

You have to go through a few steps to build your stuff, and shuffle a couple different currencies to get things done. Then scoring is determined by majorities. I can't say it's especially original, but I enjoy it.

A slight downside, it is easy to get bogged down in trading this thing for those other things, and then tossing them for a special action card which lets you get two of the other, etc. There's a lot to keep track of in order to make optimal turns.

Like most Kramers, this game defies genre convention and really requires new vocabulary to discuss it.  There are new mechanics (of course) some of which are very cool.  I love choosing how to divide points and money at the intermission.  The trade-up-a-set end game scoring cards were cool too.  Overall, it had a lot going on, with interesting new decisions to make, was easy to learn and highly engaging.

Just par for the course for a master like Kramer.

Kicsit Carrara, kicsit Torres és mégis teljesen más. Minden játékos kap 7-7 ugyan¬olyan akciókártyát, amiből megkeverés után felhúz 2-t. A 2 kártyából mindig csak az egyiket játsszuk ki a körünkben, majd azt dobjuk, és a végén újra 2 lap¬ra húzzuk a kezünket. A hét kártya kijátszása után vége a fordulónak. 2-3 forduló után vége a játéknak. Mindegyik akciókártyánk 3-4-5 akciót tartalmaz, amik közül tetszőleges sorrendben 2-3-at hajthatunk végre. Afféle akciópont-elköltésről van szó, ahol a választott akciókat a kártyán letakarom egy jelölővel, így az többször nem választható. A választható akciók sem bonyolultak: pénzt kaphatunk, téglát vásárolhatunk a téglapiacról, a már megvett tégláinkból építkezhetünk, tekercset kaphatunk (opcionális akciók érhetők el vele), fáklyát kaphatunk (akciópont-jelölő, tehát ezzel átvihetünk 1 akciópontot egy későbbi kártyára, hogy ott akár az összes lehetőséget végrehajthas¬suk majd). 
Maga a játéktábla 4 negyedre van osztva (mind a 4 épületnek saját negyede van), és az építészmeste¬rünk mindig az egyik negyedben áll, csak ott hajthat végre műveleteket. A téglapiac középen, a metszés¬pontban található, de arra is igaz, hogy az egyik ne¬gyedben csak a piac épp oda eső részében vásárol-hatunk. A téglák értéke természetesen különböző, legdrágább a dzsókerként is használható fehér. Csak ott vásárolhatunk és építkezhetünk ahol állunk, ha tovább akarunk menni, akkor fizetni kell, ezért az akcióinkat jól kell optimalizálni. 
Persze az építkezés a legfontosabb, mert a játék végén pontokat kapunk ha egy adott helyen mi építettünk a legtöbbet. Ha jól építkezünk akkor kapunk kaphatunk afféle célkártyát, ami a játék végén szintén pontot ér. 
A szabályok jól átláthatók, érthetők, de mégis sok agyalni valót adnak játék közben, ezért gyakorlott játékosoknak való, még akkor is, ha nem agyégető játékról beszélünk.

RATING: 4.5
Abstract, card driven, area majority game.  It's almost surreal that we are building stacks of tower blocks and performing rotary movement (always clockwise) with our standee, who is a mounted Roman officer, our choices constrained by cards and a time varying supply of differently "colored" building blocks in the central quarry.  I personally feel that there is a requirement for a game to invoke, at a minimum, a modest emotional response.  Why do I care about building a majority of blocks in this row or group?  This game doesn't excite me at all.  Porta Nigra is an incoherent game mechanic salad with no soul.  Next!!

RATING: 7
A familiar Kramer and Keisling design - simple rule set but deep strategic options. It's in essence an area control game with different majority scoring. Game is very tense with bricks constantly being bought out and construction spots being filled before you could get your hands on it. Intermediate scoring between picking VP or money to fuel your next round also introduce a tense game decision. Michael Menzel again creates a beautiful board and the 3D aspect of the brick areas a nice visual end game product.

Light euro game with a variety of options & choices to make in a turn & throughout the game. Am looking forward to another playing of it to nail down how I feel about the actual choices in the game & how they lead to a winning strategy. Good solid design & elegant in what it accomplishes related to play structure, choices & obstacles/decisions to overcome.

Great Euro with a classic feel. It's fun in this day of individual player boards to get everyone back on a central board competing directly. It always feels like you have something good to do on your turn, but you definitely want to race to finish certain things. Easy to teach. The board looks really great all built up at the end!

[floatleft][ImageID=2545501][/floatleft]Porta Nigra is a very streamlined area majority game with a clever action selection mechanism. Each player has an identical deck of cards, each card shows 3 to 5 actions on it. You shuffle your deck and draw 2 cards, play one on a turn and draw back to 2. When all players have played through all of their cards the round ends, in a 4p game you play two rounds. Each card shows a number of torches on the bottom, this is how many actions shown on that card you can perform, it's always 1 or 2 fewer than the number of actions pictured. You can also gain torch tokens, as an action on some cards. Torch tokens allow you to use more actions from a card, so gaining them essentially banks you an action for later. This system of action selection is interesting and has to walk a fine line between so many options that it's irrelevant, and so few that the player is frustrated. I think they did a good job of that but since action sequencing is vitally important in the game you do sometimes feel arbitrarily punished for not having access to certain actions when you need them. It lends the game a slightly lighter air than it would otherwise have with a less restrictive action selection system.

The core of the game is in the buy bricks and build actions. Before either of these actions you can move to one of the four quadrants (you must move clockwise from above, as was the custom at the time) for each quadrant you enter you must pay a coin. Each quadrant has two brick markets, the white bricks are available in each quadrant, then there is a quadrant specific brick colour: black, blue, red, or yellow. These have increasing costs of 1, 2, 3, or 4 coins. White bricks can be used as a brick of any other colour, and cost 5 coins. The brick market is refilled if at the start of someone's turn there are fewer than 7 bricks in the market, then it's refilled by flipping up market refill tiles until there are 14 or more bricks available. Buy actions are often colour specific such as 'buy black bricks', however, if there are no black bricks you can use that action to buy whichever colour you want. I found this system to be needlessly swingy and fiddly. It makes planning very difficult because it may be that you would benefit greatly from having zero red bricks in the market so you can use your buy red action as a different colour. If opponents cause the red bricks to empty, you are very happy, if they cause the market to refill then you are very sad. If they could intelligently decide to influence your access to red bricks that would be fine, but they have no idea what's in your hand so their actions randomly affect you in a significant way. Again, I find this design decision takes a bit of strategic depth from the players, making the game lighter than it could have been. A final note about the bricks is their fiddly nature. They are miniature [thing=88]Torres[/thing] bricks and it can be annoying to stack them in the cramped quarters of the brick market when refill time comes around. A small quibble, but I am not above such complaints :P

[center][ImageID=2722054 medium][/center]

Okay, but the real strategic nugget in the game is the build action, that's where the battle for area majority is realized. Each of the quadrants has many building sites and each site tells you the number and colour of bricks you need to build there. You supply the bricks top them with an oddly shaped roman of your player colour and score the points listed on the spot. Yellow bricks yield higher returns than black bricks in a thinly veiled coins->VP modulo action efficiency conversion. However, each location has one or more rows which are scored at the end of the game based on who has placed the most bricks in the row. Ties go to the tied player who placed the most valuable brick tower. This would have you build many times in the same region, which would necessitate (most likely) traveling around the board collecting some bricks from market and returning to build which costs coins. Perhaps you can be more efficient building in multiple places, but then winning majorities is difficult. However, there are 6 building cards on display which name a quadrant and colour combination, if you build in the named quadrant with the named colour you claim the card. These are set collection where you want cards from different quadrants. So the sprinkle-strategy has an answer to the majority quagmire. This part of the game hangs together excellently. There is lots of tension and hard decisions as you're torn between different options and opportunities. Winning will likely require a careful approach where you manage some set collection but also win some majorities, the relative balance can change but you cannot ignore one in favor of the other and hope to win.

I do like the game overall, but the issues I mentioned hold it back from being a 7 for me. Perhaps I am simply misguided in wanting a more deeply strategic offering. The game is fun and challenging to play, but I don't think that it offers anything that makes it stand out in the catalog of K&K games, let alone the entirety of our hobby. Looking only at very recent releases their [thing=129948]Palaces of Carrara[/thing] is a far superior game, and if you want a medium-light area majority game then I would suggest the excellent [thing=165986]Royals[/thing] by Peter Hawes from 2014.

First impression

RATING: 7
Porta Nigra is the heaviest Kramer game for a long time, probably since the Tikal trilogy. It has commonalities with Palaces of Carrara, the theme and the different colored building blocks with different values. While Palaces is a comparably quick and swingy race game of achieving victory conditions first, Porta Nigra is a long and deep majority game with a minor set collection element. The action selection mechanism is a recollection of the mask trilogy albeit more restrained by cards only allowing certain combinations of actions each round and thus more suited to modern tastes.

The game has enough clever details to provide food for thought and allow creative moves. The name-giving monument can be a game breaker if neglected by other players. Otherwise, it's a long battle for those majority points. "Better than expected" is a common reaction for Porta. A good game although I would go for Palaces of Carrara most of the time instead. I don't mind the long playing time and the perceived lack of building up abilities which some criticize. If there's a problem with it, it's the lack of a differentiating element that other games haven't done more focused before.

RATING: 8
This Kramer Kiesling game is probably one of their more tactical ones.  There is general strategy about what goals you'd like to reach and what scoring mechanisms you'd like to maximize, but you have to be ready to improvise when your action cards don't come up when you really need them or when that one space you've been planning to build on is grabbed before you get enough pieces bought.

This feels like an underrated Kramer/Kiesling game. But the card/action selection system is unique and interesting and building up the different areas of the board is satisfying. There are multiple routes to victory and a lot of interesting decisions to make. A delicious point salad that shines with 3 players but is probably a bit too long at 4.

Much better than I expected. There are bonus cards to give you some direction, privileges to help you accomplish your goals, multiple actions to choose from each turn, area majority to keep track of...

Great game by great designers. Really enjoy the a la carte action selection mechanic with the cards. Super elegant game. Go through your deck twice and the person with the most points wins. On your turn you play a card, and then do a number of actions as depicted by the number of torches on the card and the actions allowable on the card as well. Nice area control aspect of the game too. I could see this game bumping up to an 8 if it withstands repeated plays.

A bit heavier (although not heavy) K&K game. Quite an abstract game in the end, but satisfying anyway. Building castles is interesting and fun - the game itself is far from unique, but who cares? I'll have to give some minus-points for the mechanism, where one player makes all the moves before it's next player turn: that bring (sometimes) quite amount of waiting time ESPECIALLY because the player before you can ruin (accidentally) your plan just before it's your turn. In those cases you'll have to plan your turn from the scratch and that takes more time too. But still, Porta Nigra is one of those games, which I'm ready to play again, but there isn't nothing why should I buy my own copy.

RATING: 6.8
It's no wonder Kramer&Kiesling got stuck in the world of their unofficial, as I call it, "construction with tiles" series, as the first one, Asara got a Spiel des Jahres nomination while the second one, Palaces of Carrara earned a Kennerspiel des Jahres nomination but later ones (Nauticus and Coal Baron) did not reach this level of success. Porta Nigra clearly fits this series but, for me, unfortunately does not change the trend: I like it a bit less than any of the four that preceded it.
Why? Because the game is fiddly. Maybe it's there to support the theme (yeah, it's nice to build the levels of Colosseum together), but both the rules and the physical game are a bit more fiddly than I like. Also, while I appreciate Michael Menzel's artwork, the layout and the texts/icons on the board are not as clear and visible as those in the four other games. Also, with four players there is just a too great chance that one player might get stuck because others' actions mostly hurt that one player - it definitely seems to be better with three or two.
So, all in all, it's not a bad game at all, but it's probably a better experience if you have not played many of the four games listed above; if you prefer more complex rules over elegant designs; and if you play mostly 2- or 3-player.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I know some people says this one fires Palaces of Carrera but I don't agree. There is enough differences between the two and I prefer the race/cut throat nature of Palaces more. That being said, there is still potential races to gain the necessary bricks/build spots around the board to win majorities. The box is a bit bigger than the standard euro. I do like the mechanic of playing a card from your hand of two and taking the appropriate number of available actions equal to the torches on the card...and that one can use spare torches to take extra actions. I don't need to own this one, but would be happy to play if asked. There is some annoying aspects to this one including a card display that doesn't work into your plans but can score a large number of points. The influence cards were an interesting addition, but may just get in the way sometimes and cause some additional AP.

A fabulous and elegant game that is so well designed, you can almost infer the rules from just looking at the board.  it's a heavy worker placement game where the action choices are constrained by the card you select from a hand of two.  It's beautiful to look at, and turns can be very rewarding since efficient play can reap multiple rewards one after another.  

It seems to run a tad long, so I don't know if I'd play it with more than two players.

Solid game again from kramer and kiesling. This is am area majority at heart. I like the card system and the board with the four sections. The rules are relatively simple and the game flows well like most kramer and kiesling games. I liked it with 3. With two it was a little long (for a two player game) and I felt it wasn't as interesting. This is a problem for area control with two in general. After three plays I felt like my play was optimal and there isn't much to explore strategically. Since this is pretty much a three player only for me it will probably not get any play time. On the trade pile this one goes.

This was a random pick from the game library in a con, yet quite the satisfying experience. A bit on the long side; I think in the long run I'd enjoy this more if this fell to the 60–75 min slot instead of 75–120 min. The action card system was delightful, though, with lots of things you want to do but just can't.

A perfectly fine offering from K&K. It's got some of their signature mechanisms while still seeming fresh. My main complaint is that it's "too long for what it is." Given the depth of decisions here, this should be an hour max. We played at a pretty decent clip, and it still took 90 minutes. Unfortunately, I think this length could only go up, as people start trying to min-max their turns, consider their entire deck more, pay more attention to what others are doing. Maybe everyone else was already doing that, but I can see--as usual with this duo of designers--some real possibilities for AP here. In fact, having said all that, I think I've talked myself out of my initial 6 rating: you probably would have to convince me to play this one again (less than 4 players, no APers, nothing quicker to play).

The set collection of the different building parts and with specific bricks... the Selection of the card to use and what actions on that card to perform and finally the competition for majorities in the different parts of the board...

It's an excellent game, full of tough decision to be made... really liked it.

Got my first play of Porta Nigra last night. 3 player game took 2 hours which is longer than you would expect for a Kramer/Kiesling game but I expect that time to come down once we are familiar with the game.
Basically you are building tower blocks (they look great!) in the 4 sectors of the city from buying bricks at the market, so it has similarities to Palaces of Carrara. The game only plays over 2 rounds and during each you draft (think Dominion) actions cards from your fixed deck. 
There are a lot of ways to get VPs and the end game scoring adds a lot more. Our finally scores were around the 300 mark.
I really like the smooth gameplay and the somewhat cutthroat nature of getting to do the most effective action before your opponents.
After my second game (4 players, 2 hours) I am coming to the conclusion that the runtime is just far too long. The 2 rounds of the game allow you to perform the same actions twice and apart from fewer available spaces on the board little else has changed, which makes the game "feel" boring.
If the runtime could get down to 75 minutes this game would be great!
Lowered my rating.

A thinky exercise in economy and building which seems to be most let down by the flabbiness of the honour cards. It seems to me that this portion of the game could be easily slimmed down in favour of - say - an income mechanic. Still, there's no arguing with the reputation of the designers.

Porta Nigra is a game where you move your game piece around in a circle, buying tower pieces from markets in some areas, and dropping them off in building spots in others. The game operates with a set of cards, each representing a set of actions, that are the same for all players, but drawn and played in a different order. Each of the four areas where tower pieces can be built have slightly different area majority rules for end-game scoring. Also, you can claim a bonus card for the color/area combination if it happens to be available. There are also a variety of "scroll" cards that are available, which provide a variety of bonuses. Like most of Kramer and Kiesling's games, Porta Nigra is an enjoyable eurogame with solid gameplay, but it doesn't really do much to stand out. I do wish there weren't "get there first" issues with the bonus cards.

The game I was probably most excited about. I love Kiesling & Kramer so this was at the top of my list of games to get. 

Has a lot of similarities to their previous game called The Palaces of Carrara. They are different and I will own both, but I feel many people will find them too similar and will end up only owning 1 or another. 

I love the building materials in this game. The visuals are amazing and I just love the idea of the game. It is fairly simple and very easy to play with new gamers. Lovely game, I am happy to have it.

RATING: 9
Another extremely satisfying area majority game by Kramer and Kiesling! This game is sort of a heavier permutation of the ideas in The Palaces of Carrara. You are buying colored bricks and building parts of four buildings, by paying money to move your worker to the regions where the bricks you want are available, and then again to where you want to build. Each build spot has both a height and a color requirement, and each build spot gives you instant points, a cool benefit for every third brick you place, AND a different way in which it's majority scores. To make things even more interesting, your action options are dictated by the cards you draw from your deck, AND you are trying to line your actions up to also grab bonus building cards that come to you when you build a specific color in a specific building. The economy of the bricks vs dollars is really tight, and the whole thing balls into this really elegant and fascinating puzzle. Super excited for more plays of this game.

A fantastic medium-weight area control game. The card play and the area control elements remind me of Rococo. I still prefer Rococo slightly more because it is a bit more thematic, and the deckbuilding is awesome. But Porta Nigra definitely rewards more for area control and set collection.

There are a lot of choices to make in this game and those choices are quite interesting.  Almost everything you do can get you points, but you want to get those points by building and positioning yourself so that you are first in every scoring area.  Impossible to do, of course, but fun to try.
The negative of this game is that it really only works well with 3 players.  Two is ok, but there isn't quite enough tension, and four players is just too long.

A helyzet, az, hogy sok újdonságot nem hozott be, mégis izgalmas volt és határozottan élveztem. Ami nekem érdekes, hogy a sok döntés mégsem szívta el teljesen az agyamat. Kitaláltam stratégiámat, és végrehajtottam. 3 fős játékban nem volt olyan sok kiszorítósdi. A játék erénye talán az, hogy kellemes átmenet a családi és a komolyabb darabok között. bátran lehet olyanokkal játszani, akinek nem ez az első játéka.

Smooth and swift area majority game. Mostly tactical, but the rondel market rewards those who plan ahead best. The whole thing is a bit passive aggressive, and players can totally get locked out of points they've been working towards all game. The last player naturally has a bit of an advantage. Overall, I think Porta Nigra does a lot of things right but I don't feel the need to add it to my collection any time soon.

Porta Nigra is a nice break from the typical engine-building Euros. Players go around the board buying bricks and constructing buildings. A number of aspects influence the tactical and strategic decisions made here – players score for area majorities and sets collected at the end, but have to work with financial constraints as well.

The main reservation I have is that the game lasts a little long (~90 minutes) for its weight. The board situation shifts unpredictably, and players often have to reevaluate their optimum moves by the time their turn arrives.

Porta Nigra is the kind of blandly competent title that might have seemed great 500 games ago but now just seems forgettable.

The setting is nominally something to do with building in the Roman city of Augusta Treveroum (modern-day Trier), but there's no particular connection there. The board has four quarters and players move clockwise through them, Rondel-style, at a cost of 1 coin per space. A turn consists of 2-5 actions taken from one of two available cards, such as "buy a Torres-style block", "take a token" or "build a tower". Each quarter sells a different colour of block and has slightly different building requirements: one awards points for very large towers, while others award bonuses for the majority of towers of the same height. There is also a face up array of cards with quarter/colour combinations, which can be taken if the matching tower is built; sets of these are worth end-game points. Two kinds of intermediate bonus reward building regularly and not haording.

It's fine. There's plenty of competition for purchasing blocks and building towers, particularly later in the game when majority scoring is on the line, and plenty of tension around timing and money-management.

There is enough randomness in the various card flips to be annoying -- not enough to dominate, but enough to have a material impact -- and the whole thing is just rather bland. There's no real player differentiation, minimal scope for long-term strategy and minimal interaction. I'm surprised that BGG says best with 3 as my impression was that there was not enough competition for spaces and essentially no chance of hitting one of the player-controlled end-game triggers. (Though with 4 there might be too much downtime and too little room for forward planning...)

It's not a game I finish thinking "if only I had done X...". 

Perfectly sets the tone for Stronghold's "Great Designers [Bring Their B-Game] Series". Middleweight pablum.

RATING: 6
The core gameplay of using cards to get actions to build buildings to score points, claim goals, and eventually score area majority is interesting.  It isn't amazing, but it works, and I enjoyed it.  On the other hand, I did not care for the art/visual design, and the bonus cards (favor cards?) are one of the most tacked on systems I've seen in a game.  Having 14 bonus cards on the side slows the game down more than anything else, and I'm having a hard time justifying its value.  Something needs to be there to buff up the design, but this option seems clunky and uninteresting.

The game seems like it is in an odd spot for the right number of players.  4 players was slow and too long.  The geek likes it best with 3, but I'm wondering how good the area majority gameplay is with fewer than 4.  I probably won't find out.

RATING: 7.2
tl;dr: more of the same... which means it's solid!

K+K have been going at it and rarely disappoint. Sometimes they're simply good, sometimes they're amazing. This one falls in between those.
It's mostly a rehash of elements you know from other games. A market system, building, majorities, some cards to switch things up. It's a very solid design again, but other than working very well it doesn't really stand out exactly because everything in there has been done many a time before. And that's fine, because I enjoyed it.
Oh, one small remark on strategy: I tried doing everything except scoring in Porta Nigra, but the game didn't steal it's title and it seems like winning without scoring there will be very hard indeed. I had hoped more different strategies would be viable.
And a small remark on the bits: the towers are nice, but 5% (or so, I didn't count) where malformed and didn't stack properly, and that's a shame.

Porta Nigra is a classic medium to medium-heavy Euro with lots going on and lots to think about. Broadly speaking, you're trying to score area majorities at game end, but there are a lot of other ways of scoring points in the process. It very clearly feels like a game that has had a lot of time and energy spent developing it and everything works and holds together remarkably well.

It feels like a game from two master designers - which is exactly what it is.

That's not to say that I don't have some concerns about it though; the race to complete the mission cards which score 30, then 42 and then 56 points seems a little arbitrary as they scale down in availability. I'm not 100% sure that luck of the draw (in player order) is a bigger deciding factor than anything else in these once players are dedicated to trying to achieve them. It can also bog down in AP in places, though the clever card draw mechanism reduces this substantially.

A wonderfully clever, rewarding game that I'd play happily most days, though I'd be slightly selective of who I'd play it with.

I'm a huge Kramer/Kiesling fan. I almost always enjoy a game that they design. I'd heard about this one, but it had dropped off my radar as it didn't seem to get much buzz. Given the designers I was happy to try it.

The game is about building towers (although usually short ones). There's four quadrants in the game. Each quadrant sells 1 of the four colored bricks and the wild white bricks. Each quadrant has spaces you can build towers into, with spots designated for particular colors of towers. Each quadrant has a different way of scoring, building requirements and a different type of majority contest for points at the end of the game.

You have an action deck and every round you'll have a choice of two cards, a new one you just pulled and the old one you didn't use in the previous round. There will be 2-5 possible actions on each card and some number of action points on the card (which can be augmented if you have extra action tokens). The actions get you money, allow you to buy a particular color brick (or any color), build a tower, get a bonus card (if you can pay 1 or 2 scrolls), get scrolls or get an extra action token. You can always move your dudes around the 4 quadrants to be in the correct place to buy a brick or build a tower, but it costs a buck to move each quadrant. Each card will have some different combination of actions and you have to evaluate the board and pick the best card (and actions) for you given the constraint of your two cards.

The bricks you need might not be available as there is a limited supply. Although when they drop below X bricks, it refills to at least Y bricks via a brick deck of cards. In a 3 player game X was 7 and Y was 14.

There's bonus cards that you can claim if you build the correct color tower in the correct quadrant which score points as set collection where you want a set of all four different quadrants for the most points (multiple sets are possible). These cycle as people purchase them, being replaced with new cards.

The game feels fairly abstract and the theme is easy to overlook. I had a lot of fun with this one. The majority contests in particular are tricky, especially as you have to have the correct color bricks and quantity of bricks to build in particular spaces.

Early Impressions: Porta Nigra is a design with Kramer's name written all over it. It has all the expected elements: purchasing different-colored bricks to build towers of varying values; scoring points for building towers at different heights in different quadrants while aiming to score area majorities; set collection for bonus scoring; extra action tokens; power cards and finally, a mechanism that restricts how bricks are purchased each round. If this sounds familiar, that's because Palace of Carrara shares a very similar genetic makeup to Porta Nigra even though gameplay is different. Another game that feels similar to Porta Nigra is Asara. Unlike another recent Kramer design Coal Baron which is a worker placement that feels fresh, Porta Nigra feels like an old acquaintance that I cross path with once a year. 

As a standalone, Porta Nigra is a solid design by Kramer like many other Kramer designs. It is not unique by any stretch of the imagination, yet it satisfy the Kramer itch. The game is tight, rules are light and the pace is brisk. There is very light interaction where players jockey for different colored bricks or building cards, but otherwise, this is largely a very personal effort.  As it stands, this is not a criticism for Porta Nigra as this is a solid game. Any casual gamer would be delighted to have this game in the collection. As I scan my shelf looking at Palace of Carrara, Asara and a whole host of other Kramer designs, I am left wondering if this title belongs on my shelf because I truly love the game or whether I am bound by Kramer's legacy of churning out solid Euros.

Popular game at the Essen booth. How many Roman theme board games can there be? Apparently one more.  We are bricklayers north of the Alps in the Roman occupied Black Gate. Worker placement in the four regions of the city to build wall sections to satisfy area control on the board and set collection goals of the drafted objectives tiles. The trick is to select one card from a hand of two to maximize a combination of its available action choices. Also gain honor bonuses spending influence scrolls, and minimize costly movement costs, while simultaneously managing limited funds and timing the use of bonus torch actions.  Smooth game play to devote your time on noodling your moves to satisfy the color-specific wall requirements.

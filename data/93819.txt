RATING: 4.5
It must be that we didn't play this correctly, but this game absolutely tanked for us. It was a first raw play, but I don't see the interest. Very few combo-powers unlike all other deck builders/CCGs. It reduced itself to a slog build up until you were certain (or nearly so) of victory in one of the main scoring methods. I don't want to play this one again - but will if I have some experienced person teaching that could point out the intricacies of play.

Cunning, well crafted card game with all manner of ways to earn points. 

Too daunting for simpler folks, and requires some investment to really get the whole experience.

Initial Impression: I freely admit that I love the Rokugan setting and Legend of the Five Rings intrigues me. This game, however, is a bit of a conundrum for me. On the one hand, it's enjoyable to play and I can see alot of potential given repeated plays. On the other hand, my first playthrough left alot to be desired and I'm not sure that we didn't play incorrectly. The differences in tactics between the different clans was not readily apparent during the first play. I believe I'll need to play it a few more times in order to make up my mind about whether I truly enjoy the game.

RATING: 7.9
Quite a difficult game to get into. Our first play took forever and it was not until the endgame everybody started to realise what they had done wrong. But what also shone through was the immense potential this system has. There is so much going on and the different clans offer such variety in play style that this could become a favourite of mine. However this will depend on the fact if I can find opponents to play the game with. Let's hope I will.

If you're looking to get others interested in L5R, this might seem like a good starting point. However, first timers will struggle with the rules complexity/ambiguity, not to mention the ludicrous card wordings (making it difficult to work out exactly what some of them do). To top it all off, battles don't involve fighting so much as seeing which side can forcibly 'send home' the opposing team first through their card powers. Pretty lame. It also seems like too much hard work for not enough 'game', IMO.

Takes the CCG (which was always my favorite) and adds a few new twists. Will expand after I get a chance to play it.

Has ronin expansion.

Four preconstructed decks from the Legends of the Five Rings CCG - great concept to release decks like this in a stand-alone package, but [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/639453/]I'm not convinced it merits being a separate item on BGG[/url].

It just seems like Phoenix will always win because once they get out their farms, they can win in 4 turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
If using the deck included in the game this kinda of works but is a bit stop-start. 

If using home made decks (because you play the CCG) it doesn't work in the slightest. Military is far to easy to achieve.

Imuch prefer just to play L5R. 

Discarded in 2017.

Each of the preconstructed deck focus in their strategy to evolve in a certain path. I played the "Phoenix", which was a very defensive deck. It was so defensive that I didn't attack my fellow players (though joined in as ally) but on the other hand I wasn't attacked either. But still I won, as I could get my advance getting enough honor every round just by using my special ability, bowing an honor source and bringing a personality into play. Man that was boring (= absence of interesting decisions) and repetitive. Furthermore I found the book-keeping of money/power/honor/dishonor/chi etc. too cumbersome (Battle cards do change inital values constanstly). This way there was added complexity without a gaming benefit. None of my gaming buddies liked it either (rating after one 3 player game).

You get your moneys worth on this one (four well balanced decks). Plus, you get a nice box with a bunch of tokens and tiles and a new way to achieve vitory.

This turns out Legend of the Five Rings in a longer war campaign. Takes on a long time, but it's a treat for fans of the original game.

It seems like a nice way to get four starter decks at the same time.

This first play has inspired me to write my first review, but not in a good way...

My relationship with this game is a difficult one.  
I'm just so conflicted because I love everything about this game, except playing it.  The theme is brilliantly described in the card art and the mechanics support it too, but there's something clunky in the flow of this game, much more than most.  Part of the problem for me is the included rulebook.  i think it's the worst I've ever read and even worse as a reference during the game.  Maybe if I could play this with an experienced player so that the game's idiosyncrasies would be taught as we played, I could get into this one.  And I REALLY want to love this game.  Also, the hex-map built at the beginning of the game takes up way too much table space once players start to get some cards on the table too.

1 play only.

For me - as a total L5R ignorant - the game was surprisingly one-dimensional.  Only battles and batles.  And more combos in battles.
That was quite immersive in a way, but the interaction between cards is very complex and I'm not really  willing to invest my time and effort in this game despite it's finished, non-collectible product...

Finding regular partners for the game (and nothing else makes sense) would be really hard too...

Sold.

Well, if you are looking for a high strategic timmed action and counter action game this is it. The "duel" feel on this game is great! It brings a lot of chess concepts to an battle inter-turn based driven card game.

Played a test 2 player game. At the more complex end of the CCG/LCG spectrum. Certainly a cool theme and nice art, plus an interesting game but not one for casual players... 

Will take a few plays to get a feel for things but we'll see...

I used to play Legend of the Five Rings back in the mid-nineties. I stopped playing and sold 98% of my cards (I still find some from time to time) before 2000. This game was a gift. When I found the bulk of the unsold cards, I just added them to this game.

RATING: 7
For days after we played, I just kept on thinking about War of Honor. I could see the cards, and I pondered the different powers and what I could have done differently. Most of all, I wanted to play again right away! Quite a statement about the game I would say as this rarely happens for me. The theme is excellent, supported by wonderful artwork and atmospheric content of the cards. The four distinctive clans require different approaches to winning so this is quite a diverse game. It isn’t an easy game to learn so it may put some people off, but it is so interesting that I didn’t mind this at all. I would say that this is definitely a game for those interested in the theme and in Collectible Card Games. It is a good point of entry into the huge world of L5R created by AEG and definitely worth a try but I do recommend with others who have a real interest in the theme and CCG’s as this should make the learning experience very satisfying.

When I first saw the WoH/L5R game it quickly draw my attention because of its superior art and story.
I decided to get myself WoH, multiplayer format game that plays like L5R with a few changes. 
I like it a lot, I even bought some new clan decks soon after I bought the base game.

A hidden gem, I would say.

The only complaint is its length. It takes too long to finish playing it!

This is another great example of why you shouldn't purchase board games on a lark. I bought this in 2011, it has [i]never[/i] been played. It is the only game in my collection that wasn't a thrift purchase that has this dubious distinction. What's worse is I believe this will never change. A shame to be sure, but a physical reminder of what not to do.

The original L5R card game with four pre-constructed decks and additional boardgame elements to enhance multiplayer game. A card game that follows old tropes, with complex card play rules without increased tactical depth.

Way too much text-per-card to be acceseable for most players. Not strictly a bad game though, just doesn't seem to be worth the effort to learn it?

Never really got around to playing it. Four of us got into Legend of the Five Rings and thought this would be a neat, long form way of playing but we just never got around to using it and ended up putting L5R down for a while. Now, looking at it just makes me think I'll have to learn two games just to get started.

I know this is really a gateway drug to the larger L5R universe, but I had confidence in my ability to withstand the siren call of the CCG and play this as a standalone.

It was okay. I think the theme is great. There are some interesting timing decisions. And I like how the factions really seemed to be distinctive in their feel and play.

But overall it just wasn't my kind of game--not sure why I thought it would be, other than the fact that I used to play Magic and Guardians CCGs, and I have fond memories of them.

Really a multiplayer variant for active L5R players.  If someone is familiar with L5R they will slaughter opponents who are boardgamers.  The victory conditions somewhat mitigate general balance issues found in CCG's, but not entirely.

Terrible idea to introduce Legend of the 5 Rings. It is better as a competitive 1-on-1. This is a game that feels 'forced' with its thin layer of rules to make it look like a standalone game mode of 4 players. Very superficial.

RATING: 7
This game is a strange breed. Its sole purpose is to provide a proper multiplayer ruleset for L5R. And the market for that is pretty small. It also could be a good entry point into the L5R hobby, as it is a CCG-boardgame hybrid, but as the rules of L5R are really dense it largely fails.
I have it because of the beautiful cards, the nice box (ideal to store several decks of L5R) and eventually to play the multiplayer format.

Good 2-player game.  Very tense and short.  Again, what doesn't T&E scoring make better?

[ESP] Simpatico juego para 2 personas en el que hay que intentar sacar el maximo provecho a las cartas, tratando de preveer lo que hará el oponente.
Muy importante es no olvidar que aquí no se gana con la fila más fuerte sino que se pierde con la más debil...

It's good that it has a solo version, but it's to easy. And the game against others depends a lot on the cards you recive. Nothing special.

[u]December 08:[/u] Played once with TT users at Interlude Café (Paris).

The game plays fast and doesn't seem so easy, in fact, me and my partner won but I don't really know why. The game offers some nice subtelties with its scoring system which is nice for such a short and simple game.

[u]December 2010:[/u] Changed my rating system, the game is now rated 4. Now that I think of it it never really deserved more. There are so many much better games out there that are both very simple short and with nice subtleties...

I purchased this game when Spiel 2008 was about to close. After a bit of irritating hassle with the publisher—the cards in my copy had numerous annoying printing errors—I got a new set and played the game with SWMBO. Although we both liked the game at first, the dominant strategy we hit upon after game four or five became so dominating that it all became a matter of the cards you were dealt at the beginning of the game. You can fairly easily deduce which rows or columns provide the greatest rewards for your opponent, and then block those with a card which gives you the greatest potential reward. If the opponent has no cards to fight you, you win. I had hoped it would take longer than it did, but regrettably, it was not to be. We haven't played the game since, unfortunately. It's too bad, really, the artwork is nice and the core idea is pleasantly simple... But there isn't much of a challenge in this game once you figure it out.

In our games so far, the play of the final few cards hasn't mattered, as the lowest scoring row or column was determined long before the end. Still, it's an enjoyable game that gives you plenty to think about.

RATING: 6
Players alternate playing a card into a common 5x5, ever growing grid.  Cards are numbered from 0-5, with six of each.  One player is playing "rows" and the other is playing "columns", each scoring points for cards along that line.  Points are face value, but.... pairs are 10 times face value, and three of a kind is 100 points.  When the grid is full, the lowest row or column loses the game for that player.  Brilliant little filler, that even includes a solo "beat your score" variant.  The master does it again.

Similar to other Knizias like Atlanteon and Kingdoms, but this is simpler, quicker and more fun.  The theme, as usual, makes no difference at all, but the illustrations are pleasant enough.

A Knizia math based 2-players tile placement game where one player controls lines and the other columns.  Plays under 10 minutes, decent fun (if a bit cerebral).  Sudoku players will probably like this.  Fills a niche of its own.  Review up after many plays.  Very addictive.

Quick little tile placement game with nice big chunky cardstock tiles with robots on them, in a nice small portable box.  Some strategy, and a fair amount of luck.  Only played the 4-player partners version.  I don't normally like partner games, but this was short and sweet, so I thought it was OK.

Child of a design which appears in Knizia's "Blazing Aces" book. Because of the different cards here, it is strategically more interesting: it's harder to prevent your opponent from scoring. Comes in a cute metal box: great travel companion!

Talk about a simple design!  Cleverly simple though.  One player gets the columns and the other the rows in a 5X5 grid.  The twist is the lowest of he five is your score, simialr to the scoring for Knizia's Ingenious.  Fast and fun.

[Cocktail Games 2008 edition] {Abstract, couple; tile-placement, mathematics, partnership; optimal 2p}  {Solo: 5; 4p: 7; draw-card: 6} Robot Master is a very cute 2p filler from Knizia.  To me, it is a remote cousin of Kingdoms.  It is short, fast-paced, handy, interactive and strategic.  Replayability may be weak but I certainly like it very much at the moment.

The illustration is cute but it doesn't add much to the game play.  The game itself is still an abstract card game.

Watching.  Another pasted-on theme, but cute and appealing.  Reading about the game play reminds me of the card game StrataGem (gems & 3x3 grid), but maybe not as light?  We liked StrataGem but it was very, very simplistic.  If this comes in a tin then I'm all over it.

Un jugador puntua por las columnas y el otro por las filas. Optimiza la posición de los robots de diferentes valores, dado que al final de la partida perderá el jugador (o equipo) que posea la fila/columna con menor valor. 2/3 robots idénticos valen x10/100

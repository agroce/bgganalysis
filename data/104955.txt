Have played one game of this so far... and have found it to be very 'blah'. Probably the second game for which I had high hopes which has disappointed me (Omen was the first): I love two player games, I love abstracts, I love the historical period... and yet this left me completely cold, like it was missing a kind of spice. 

I will give this another chance but, currently, there are so many better two player games out there... off the top of my head, I can think of at least 5 from my collection that I would rather play over this (see my other ratings).

After like 2-3 plays I'm a little bit underwhelmed by this one, which is kind of strange, cause I had a good time playing "regular" Antike a few years back. Not that it is a bad game. Maybe I just grow old. Anyway I stays in my collection for now, I might give it another try.

Not sure how replayable this game is. Most games seem to devolve into a sort of chase or race; whether it is a military going around destroying temples at the end of the game or a chase to see who can get more cities/temples built before the other player's military hunts them down.

Very tight design, easy to play and understand.

The beginning is interesting as you jockey for points but the ending seems samey.

I like the game and will continue to play but not sure for how much longer.

There are definitely elements of Concordia here, but overall the experience is less balanced and the endgame is less interesting.  Gold provides a way to trade gold for other resources, get VP and in-game bonuses from technologies, and only use one spot on the rondel to bulk up before acting.  The other resources do not provide nearly as large of a benefit, so they are simply inferior.

Still, a neat game to play until the players figure out that problem.

Good 2-player game. Similar mechanisms than Antike (which I like both with 2 players using the variants available here and with more players), but Casus Belli provides a different experience. There is much more going on and the competition for the different kind of cards is fierce. Gameplay is more distint from Antike than you would guess after reading the rules.

It's fine, but a bit too constrained and incremental. I don't feel like I can pull off any kind of spectacular move, just pull ahead very slowly. And really, if I'm playing a 2-player game like this, I'd rather play a wargame.

Antike Duellum is a great game of light civ-building and combat for 2 people.It plays fast with no significant analysis paralysis.

I haven't yet identified any dominant strategy. So far, each match has always been pretty competitive, even when the two players adopt different strategies (military vs. science/construction).

Hard choices and heart pounding moments are the rule over the 1,5 to 2 hours of a game. Highly recommended for eurogamers in need of 2-player games.

UPDATE: After I found the excellent POLIS-Fight for the Hegemony, similar in theme and in feel, Antike Duellum was sort of retired early and traded away.

    At heart, this "war-game" is more of an engine-building game with conflict being a byproduct of those endeavors. But the conflict element doesn't exist without reason... it prevents the game from being a solitaire experience as players must tactically consider the implications of each move. And the rondel mechanism goes a long ways in helping players foreshadow their opponent's move so they can make calculating decisions. 

    On top of that, the game-play is largely deterministic; The random elements are few, well-balanced, and add a layer of depth to the game (Do I score and allow my opponent to get x-card, or do I hold off?). Furthermore, the numerous ways to score victory-points really provides for a dynamic/interesting middle-to-end-game. 

    If I had to criticize anything, I would say the tempo of the game may play out in a repetitive fashion... especially if the players are equally skilled; but whether this is considered a flaw/feature will depend on the player. For me, this is what war-games should be like.

Nekem tökéletesen visszaadta a "nagy" Antike hangulatát, szinte ugyanaz, csak 2 személyre van optimalizálva. Helyesebben inkább ez már az Antike II-re hajaz (vagyis az Antike II hajaz erre, mert az volt később), mert pl. a városok típusa itt sincs előre rögzítve. Aki ismeri valamelyik "nagy" Antike-ot, annak kb. 3 perc a különbségeket elmondnai. Ami nagy újdonság, az a kiképzés: a seregek csak 2 lépésben kerülhetnek fel a táblára. Eseménykártyákra sem emlékszem az eredetiből, ötletes kompenzáló mechanizmus, színesíti a játékot. Sőt városfalra sem emékszem, de az lehet hogy volt?! Összességében azoknak ajánlom, akik nagyon szeretik az Antike-ot, és ketten is játszanák, de zavarja őket, hogy csak a térkép töredékét használhatják.

I love the theme of this two player game. I've always been drawn to games involving Roman or Greek themes. Having a two sided board is a plus. The graphic design and components fit well together. Not over the top, but sufficient. I think the first few times one plays this game, they are likely to love it. However, there is very little randomness to the setup. Also, the various armies do not have any differences. So, re-playability will suffer greatly after repeated plays. That really brings it down for me.

This is a two player version of Antike by Mac Gerdts. The rules are simple and intuitive, but the gameplay is tense and engaging.

The game seems very well balanced and offers strategical and tactical choices galore. It compares to chess in that it offers deep gameplay with abundant decisions based on what your opponent is doing.

With a well integrated theme, clever gameplay, accessibility and great components, this game is highly recommended for those looking for a mano a mano experience.

I've played Antike Duellum only in yucata.de and it would be interested to try out the game live.

I like the chess like nature of the game with two. There's a lot of strategy and especially timing involved in the game which I do enjoy. Biggest problem with the game is that it's typically quite obvious who's winning long before the actual end of game.

It's a good game and is interesting for the first 2/3 of it. But once you fall behind after a certain point, I don't think it's feasible to win. This really needs 2 very experienced players but I think it's unlikely I'll ever gain that experience or find anyone else willing to gain it with me.

I normally disagree with Tom Vasel about most Euros, but I have to admit he was right about this one: it's boring. I actually don't mind the resource and area control aspects of the game, but the moment combat is introduced, the game really drags (the opposite of what it should do!). 

Deterministic combat is never very exciting, but it can be done well, especially in Euro hybrids such as this. Unfortunately in this game, when military activity starts to pick up, everything suddenly stalls because both players need more money and iron to recruit and deploy more troops. What ends up happening is that one exciting battle takes place, and right when things have gotten interesting, both players are required to jump through several hoops before the next battle begins. Actions begin to feel repetitive and almost scripted the longer the game continues. By the end of the game you just want it to be over.

An underrated masterpiece. Look, I get the historical appeal of GMT games (specifically the COIN series) but they take so long are are so rules heavy. This is your best alternative when you want that tense two player action without all the set-up and nose-rulebook fervor. Simply put GMT games have to get to the table often to truly appreciate their ZEN. Antike Duellum has a very simple ruleset with very deep, strategical and tactical game play. The player engages Temple Building, Movement, Activation, Resource production, Wall Building, through the typical Gerdts Rondel, all the time being mindful of victory conditions. This game should be what chess is on a national scale. I would really like to see a 1776 Version of Antike with Red and Blue pieces and a new map. This game really is remarkable and I'm not sure yet (since I only did a run-through) but I think I like it even better that its big bother 4-player Antike 2. Only two complaints and they are minor, the cards are printed with both English and German language, Also the game board and cards are not aesthetically pleasing for a modern board game.

[u]May 2014[/u]: A good civilization game for two players. Overall I like this game a lot. However there are some issues, first, it seems easy to fall into a rythm where both players just mimick one another as with any other rondel game. However, the unique cards and the way technology works (it costs more to be first than second and being first brings one point) breaks this cycle. I am not sure either how much this game will prove replayable as it seems the opening moves will become scripted. Nevertheless, I haven't arrived at this stage yet and given it is not a game that we can often break out, I don't see this as being a major turn off anytime soon.

RATING: 6.5
I’m a fan of the rondel mechanic, and this game didn’t let me down. Now, when writing this I haven’t tried the game a whole lot (only twice), so I cannot give great strategic advices, but like all of my other comments in this list it’s my first hand impression. Now, this game is a eurogame, but it is very confrontational as you most likely will have to attack each other a few times during the game in order to win. While I did like the sound of that, the actual combat was rather boring (a simple 1:1 kill ratio). In general there wasn’t much combat going on, but that might just be because we played the game casually without focusing a lot on combat (as my wife hates very confrontational games) - at least not until the end in the first game, by which we HAD to focus on military in order to destroy temples so we could get the last achievement. In the second game, on the other hand, I attacked a lot in the beginning and expanded like crazy, so my two games have turned out very differently which is a good sign.

Strategically I need to mention that it might be smart to get a temple quickly and put it in a marble city so you can get a good marble production so you can build more temples and put them in other cities so you can get even more ressources! This seems like a good move, and while it did happen in my first game, I tried a different strategy in my second game; I focused on gold early and that helped me to seal a very easy victory (9-5). So I think you need to test various strategies. However, this is probably another quibble I have with the game; there really aren’t many strategies you can pursue… You cannot concentrate on a specific thing; you need a little bit of everything. So it’s not like in Mac Gerdts’ Navegador in which you can focus on exploring or factories etc.

The technologies are cool and I liked that the first player to get a technology also gets an achievement, but that player has to pay around twice as much as the other player! This was a good balance. However, it seems as if some of the technologies are much better to get as fast as possible. Again, it depends on the specific game, but I think that in general the technology which grants you an extra resource each time you produce is going to be bought rather fast. The ship improvement too as it’s pretty cheap and the extra movement for ships allows you to get the “control seven sea areas” achievement card rather quickly, and probably lets you occupy the good sea areas with extra ships so your opponent is going to have a hard time getting the other (but still, I cannot imagine one player getting both of these cards, so eventually the other person is going to get it). Now, this might just be a groupthink and eventually I will learn a lot of clever play, but this is what I feel right now. Oh, I also need to say that while the cards add some randomness, it’s not much, and the cards are pretty weak and don’t make that big of a difference.
 
The game is somewhat long, but definitely not too long as other people have said; both of my games have lasted an hour. The last achievement can take a while to get (which was the case in the first game, but in the second, in which I dominated, it went rather quickly as I constantly had an advantage – not sure if there was a snowball mechanism going on, which I certainly don’t hope. Further plays will tell - and there will be more plays as I was pleasantly surprised by this game.

I have played this more and really starting to see that this is actually a clever game with solid mechanics. I like the tension this game produces with every opponent move. There are many paths to victory and every game will play different. I like that combat doesn't have to be a big factor in playing. My only gripe is the game can run long and it can take a little too long to build an engine. Overall, I feel it's quite impressive for a civ game because it's not a deeply complicated game but has some good decision making with the rondel.

Another good rondel game (I really like this mechanic for some reason). Relatively east to pick up the rules, however some of the depth of strategy wasn't apparent until later in the game (i.e. the lack of usefulness of gold, and the fact that the game is largely designed so that realistically you have to get at least one type of each victory to win). I tried a defensive/passive strategy which paid off early, however the military aggression from Tom won in the end. You also have to be extremely careful about using the rondel efficiently (as with all rondel games). In my case I spent 2-3 turns early on stopping for iron (and only getting 1-2 each time), which I think put me behind on overall efficiency in the end. Good game.

Sometimes it's an amazing, deep, tense game. Other times you get a tedious endgame that drags on forever as two evenly matched opponents keep fighting over the same territory FOREVER hoping the other one will blink first. Blah. Give me a dice roll combat system anytime. I'm not a fan of perfect information combat games and it breaks down even further in two-player games where there's little to no uncertainty in battle.

A fascinating 2 player game that is almost entirely luck free. Many paths to victory and each decision must be weighed carefully in terms costs versus benefits. However, while it is possible the AP types could bog the game down the reality is that the game moves quickly and should be finished in about two to three hours.

Highly recommended.

RATING: 8.5
Overall, a really well balanced two-player game with a very low luck factor. It stimulated me to try out or at least think through many different strategies. The "historically flavored" background is a nice bonus. I also like the historical information booklet a lot, which nicely supplements the historical theme.

It almost reminds me of Chess a little, which is high praise coming from my mouth! :)

I am glad this can be played online at [url=http://www.yucata.de/en/]Yucata.de[/url]! :)

A drawback is that the peoples on the two maps could have been balanced a little better, at least for the base game without the variant with the special units admiral and commander. Without the variant, I think the Carthaginians are slightly better off than the Romans and the Greeks are definitely better off than the Persians. Particularly in the last case, this is pretty obvious and should therefore have been avoided. At first, I had hoped I just hadn't found the hidden Persian counter advantages yet, but after having played more than 80 games on Yucata.de ([url=http://www.yucata.de/de/Ranking/Game/CasusBelli]successfully[/url], I might add ;)) and having done a serious analysis, I am convinced they are just not there in adequate amounts.
But there are still good ways to make the best of even the Persian starting position. The Greek-Persian map could also be used to give a less experienced player a slight edge. (It is a considerable edge only in games between evenly skilled opponents, if the opponent is considerably weaker, the stronger player will usually still prevail with Persia.)

However, I hope things get approximately balanced when playing with the admiral/commander variant, which gives a slight edge to the beige side (Romans/Persians), because it gets the admiral instead of the commander. The naval admiral should usually be somewhat better than its land-based counterpart, particularly on the sea and island heavy Aegean map. So using the variant is a slight advantage for the Romans and a somewhat larger advantage for the Persians, which sounds about right to offset their non-variant disadvantages.
So in my opinion, the admiral/commander variant should really be considered mandatory for balance reasons for everyone but beginners. I suspect the game was balanced for playing with the variant. Most unfortunately, it [url=http://www.yucata.de/en/Forum?ForumID=6&postid=33551#33551]isn't implemented[/url] on Yucata.de. :(

Another slight improvement potential is that some parts of the rules, particularly the rules for the admiral/commander variant on p. VII, could have been worded more clearly. However, overall the rules are really very well written.

As a reply to another comment (from Wentu) I have read here:
I don't consider it a drawback at all that the game still has a remaining small luck factor (the order in which the event cards are drawn). To the complete contrary, I think that is an extremely important feature, which makes all the difference between a bad game and a very good game for me!
Otherwise the game would be completely determinate and computers would be able to solve it and show which player always wins with which nation with perfect play - it is much less complex than Chess after all (which computers can't yet solve and probably won't be able to do so for many years to come). I am pretty sure that with some analysis, very good players could and probably would determine which player will prevail in Antike Duellum with perfect play even without computer help.
Another important difference to Chess is that Antike Duellum has no draws. In Chess it is likely that with perfect play from both opponents, the game will end in a draw in spite of White's advantage in the beginning. But in Antike Duellum, whoever holds an advantage (be it whatsoever tiny) will win with perfect play. Which means that being determinate is a higher drawback than in Chess where players can at least have a fair fight without one player basically already having won in the beginning.
So I wouldn't want to play a version of Antike Duellum without event cards - certainly not after it has been solved! I would rate such a version of the game around a measly 4 instead of my very good 8.5. The devil of many games is certainly in the details!

Antike Duellum gives you a bit of everything and does not fail to deliver, resource management, men on the map.  It is tense from the very first turn with excellent pacing. Your first half of the game is peacefully building your own civilization, then as the board gets tighter, that's when the gloves come off! You start looking for the last couple of VP to clinch a victory - Excellent game.

A perfectly serviceable 2-player version of Antike. The changes felt good for gameflow (and for a bit of catchup).

I found the freedom of what type of city to build (with extra cost for adjacent equivalent cities) an interesting contrast with the original.

Two-player strategy game based on modified rules from Mac Gerdts' Antike. The game includes two scenarios: Punic Wars (Rome vs. Carthago) on one side of the board, and Persian Wars (Greeks vs. Persians) on the other. The goal of the game is to be the first to gain nine ancient personages (Kings, Scholars, Generals, Citizens, Navigators).

After a few plays on yucata I'm not all that enthralled with it. Most points are gained via builds and expansion. In every game there was some combat, but little actual conquest.

The problem is that it's a two step process to build units. First, you have to recruit them, then you have to build them. It's slow, and by the time you get them on the board, your opponent has built temples or fortresses (or both) in key areas. That not only makes them incredibly difficult to take, those areas are now producing more resources. Toss in the Res Publica tech and your temples are nigh impossible to capture. In three games I've captured exactly one temple, but won every game by using a "forward defense", where I put fortified temples on the front lines, and then expand backwards.

The net result is that to achieve victory your best bet is to simply expand and build as fast as you can, especially temples, and buy as many techs as you can. I suppose it could work out that both players will need to launch a major assault somewhere to get that final VP in a close game, but it seems like that would be the exception rather than the rule. I do like the event cards, though.

Simple "Civ-lite" for 2p.  The event cards, as a partial catch-up mechanism, are interesting, but feel (a) unfinished and (b) inadequate for purpose.  Bit worried that if you get up a tempo, it might be hard to catch up.  But still, neat and tidy, with some military interaction :-)

After a few plays on Yucata I have to say that this is an absolutely brilliant two player strategy game!

No two games are the same and there are several paths to victory.

Face-to-face may have some (minimal) downtime but probably rewarding nonetheless.

only played via the web, but i would have thought 2 player Antike, one of my favorites in the rondel series, would be better. Not enough divergence in winning strategies... a variant with few VPs needed to win might make the game more interesting...

TRADED IT!

When I realized I only ever played Antike with 2 people, this seemed an obvious choice to pick up. It really is just made to be 2 player Antike, and it played almost the same. The added effect cards were neither here nor there for me.

In the end, Antike is an interesting experiment in minimal game structure, and it works splendidly. I just had no reason to play it more than a few times.

(Rating based on 4 asynch online plays on Yucata.de [microbadge=19345])

It's not a bad game and I think there's a crowd that will like this game a lot, but it's too [thing=171]Chess[/thing]-like for me. By that I mean it's a game with almost perfect information and I prefer games that contain a little more randomness. Especially towards the end, there's a lot of back and forth that drags out the game. Also, you know who's going to win a few turns before the end, but you still have to go through the motions. This is not much fun to me.

This may not be as bad in live games, so my rating may be a bit too low.

Antike for two players?  You can do it with the base game using these rules:
[thread=352200][/thread]
[filepage=36332][/filepage]

This takes a similar concept, but makes it more polished and a separate game.  There are several rule changes which improve the game and make it work for two players.  Excellent light-medium civ game for two!

A light civilization rondel game of complete information and deterministic combat with plenty of meaningful choices.

[u]Overview[/u]
Antike Duellum is a 2 player reduction from Mac Gerdts' Antike. It keeps most of the feel and the mechanics of the older game but condenses it into a very unforgiving abstract-like game of subtle positioning and small, incremental gains. On their turn players move their marker on the rondel and execute the action on the space where they stop; the first three spaces are free, moving further away costs one resource for each additional space. The rondel contains two movement spaces ([i]duellum[/i]), three production spaces (one for each resource) and three purchase spaces (again, one for each resource). The resources are gold ([i]aurum[/i], used in [i]scientia[/i] to purchase technologies and recruit units from the supply), marble ([i]marmor[/i], used in [i]templum[/i] to purchase temples and city walls) and iron ([i]ferrum[/i], used in [i]militia[/i] to arm units and place them on the board).

The players score a point by founding five cities or building three temples or being the first to acquire a technology or razing an opponent's temple or controlling seven seas. The first to 9 points is the winner.

[u]Strategy and comments[/u]
The rondel mechanic is an elegant way to limit the actions a player can take (for free). Efficiency is key, both in production and warfare, so much that tempo should be considered a resource by itself. Military can be powerful, but recruiting and moving units takes time and coordination, so a lot of planning is needed before every movement. Fights and exchanges should be conducted only when favourable, either because your opponent isn't as efficient as you at replacing their army or because you get a positional advantage.

For such an unforgiving game, there is too much variance among the event cards; some give marginal benefits (2 resources) while others can wreak havoc (in the early game dissipating a fleet back to the supply cripples the opponent's ability to expand; doubling production of a resource can be worth a full move during the endgame); when there is a very powerful event card available, delaying the acquisition of a victory point might prove to be the best move. The second map, Greeks vs Persians, makes it easier for the Greeks to expand and to score points for controlling the seas; Carthaginians vs Romans is much more balanced.

Even though it hasn't many moving parts, this game should be considered rather heavy; trying to read a few moves in advance in a tight game is very demanding. This dampens a bit my enjoyment of the game, but it certainly isn't the game's fault. A game lasts longer than what the box suggests, probably 2-3 hours, especially if the losing player doesn't resign and tries to prolong the game even though the outcome has already been decided.

A  nice, quick playing 2 player only strategy game. A touch of light wargaming, a sprinkle of light civ building but really it's an area control type affair. Most of the game plays out on a rondel; a feature of many of Marc Gerdt's games. It's implemented very well and you really have to plan many moves ahead, keeping an eye on your opponent's choices to try and smother any problems before they fully arise. 

The board is two sided, although one side is significantly more balanced. Not a bad thing, especially if I'm playing the game against a newcomer.

Valahogy nem igazán jött be nekünk, pedig alapvetően szeretem a rondellás mechanizmust. Két fő bajom volt vele:

1. Nagyon egysíkúnak tűnik. Az újrajátszhatóságot az eseménykártyák biztosítanák, de annyira kicsi előnyöket adnak, hogy nem igazán színesítik a játékot.

2. Nagyon hoszú ahhoz képest, hogy úgyis megnyeri az előbb-utóbb az, aki egy kis előnyt szerez, de mégis ott kell mellette ülni még egy órát, és végigszenvedni, az amúgy nyílvánvaló végeredményt. Valahol ez is az eseménykártyák hibája. Úgy érzem, hogy féltek attól, hogy felborul a balance a kártyák mázlifaktora miatt, de emiatt annyira óvatosan osztották az előnyöket, hogy gyakorlatilag kiöltek minden érdekességet a játékból.

Jók lennének valami olyan kártyák, amik bizonyos eetekben nagy előnyt tudnának adni, és így lehetne kicsit specializálódni, nomeg nem lenne minden játék egyforma, és esetleg lenne lehetősége a lemaraadónak felzárkózni valami váratlan húzással.

o jogo é bastante bem desenhado (sem falhas) e muito equilibrado, com diversas estratégias de vitória a explorar, no entanto depende muito de com quem se joga e como se joga: se os jogadores forem pouco conflituosos é possível haver jogos inteiros com um ou dois combates (no fim) e neste caso é uma corrida para ver quem constrói a máquina mais eficiente; o sistema de combate em si, é algo primário, e pode criar algumas situações de mais ou menos 'empates' sucessivos

gostei do jogo, mas não o achei muito divertido, talvez um pouco longo, não há nada de mal nisso, há jogos assim ;)

RATING: 7
Good 2 player roundel game with a lite civilization and warfare theme - the main focus is on accummulating resources and building up a base of cities which can be upgraded with walls and temples in order to strengthen their defenses against attack. Combat is a simple swap of troops/defence. A euro at heart.

We found replayability is limited due to the programmed nature of moves once players are experienced - suggest that you play to one less VP to mitigate this issue.

All the bits are very good, you get 2 maps for variety. Good but not lasting.

A game that looks like it can be had for pretty cheap these days. Nice components hidden in an ugly box and maybe the fact that there is a two-player variant you can play with the parent game already might be a reason for this. Still, the map and and everything look nice and I am looking forward to giving this a go.

Played once. I like Antike so this was always going to appeal to me. The changes are just enough to successfully provide a positive 2 player experience. Our game ended with my opponent conceding though it had been tense up to this point. As with Antike the end result seems to be obvious before the game end is reached. Oct 2012

*UPDATE* Finally got in another game. Really captures the feel of Antike and makes it playable with 2. I will lift this to a "9" if it charms it's way to the table again and my experience is as good. March 2013

RATING: 7.5
Simple rules, interesting gameplay. It has somewhat of a chess-like quality to it, which is only smoothed by the randomicity of the event cards. 

This is one of those games where you need to outproduce your opponent to oblivion, therefore thoughts on defence and what to produce and when are of paramount importance. The early game will be one of expansion, in the mid game aggressive moves in order to hit the temples should be considered, while in the late game you capitalize on what you can produce in order to make the final push and win the game. 

All in all I played the Punic Wars and I definitely had the taste of these wars, even if it was overall a maritime confrontation - legions never had the opportunity to clash. 

I'd like to play this again even if, admittedly, there are so many 2-player games out there that having this hit the table won't be seen often.

For a huge fan of Antike, this was extremely interesting in its differences. This is a blast, and a great two-player Euro conflict game.

This is a lovely head to head military matchup. It is incredibly tight, to the point where it might seem procedural -- but the beauty is in the minor inflections and playing the face-up "pity" cards to gain leverage at opportune moments. It's incredible how this game has so little randomness but still manages to be far more than zero-sum.

Antike Duellum always ends with an iron production competition, if you fail to complete enough goals through the building phase. Still, this is a clever game, which deserves attention.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (October 2012)

Better (and fairer) than its predecessor, still that’s not enough for me to like a rondel game. Currently I have a very low expectation from Mac Gerdts (but I still haven’t played Concordia, so there is still hope).

The problem is the rondel itself. I feel it makes Antike Duellum slow and boring as you telegraph every move to your opponent, so for example, you can build military force and your opponent will do the same or he will build some defenses and/or temples (much easier to defend yourself than attacking). Due to this, the game can drag for a long time as there is always a response you can make to your opponent moves. I also think it has (somewhat) obvious decisions. 

I don’t feel the theme, it is more of a VP race in which the best strategy is to expand quickly and defend the limits of your empire, then expand backward for the win. Very slow, boring AND repetitive. Very low replay value. 

I won’t ever buy it and I will only play it online on Yucata if ever.

Very similar to Antike but with some nice changes. Of course it's a 2-player game which makes the direct conflict a much nicer experience in my opinion. Antike has a kill the leader dynamic that can sometimes feel short-sighted and vengeful.

Duellum allows players to decide which resource cities provide when they found them. It also has only one level of techs since there is less competition for them this seems necessary to balance gold production strategies. Players now pay gold to buy new units putting them in a recruitment box, they then pay iron to bring them into play. Marble can now be spent 1:1 for city walls which provide +1 defense. Players start with one wall and get more as they gain victory points. All resource collection actions now give the acting player 1 coin in addition to the resources, there is no coin payment at the start of player's turns. Perhaps the coolest change is the addition of event cards. When your opponent gets a victory point you get to select one event card from a display of 3. The events act as compensation for your opponent's successes. 

The game is fast and strategic exactly what you would expect from 2-player Antike. For the price this is an excellent deal and since Antike doesn't work very well with 2 players this game is mandatory for Antike fans. For those that didn't like the multi-player war-like interactions of Antike this game might give you a chance to enjoy at 2 what you couldn't quite love before.

Will have to try again but...

This doesn't seem like a lot of fun. Very quick but boring rounds building cities till the map is full. Deploying armies and attacking seem VERY expensive. Maybe later in the game it will be worthwhile but we didn't play that far. My conclusion: in (multiplayer) Antike the extensive streamlining results in a fast game that focuses on player interaction and threats, where in this two player variant that streamlining results in a demonstration that multiplayer interaction really makes the game, and without it there is too little left to enjoy. We may have been playing too conservatively though.

The battle mechanics (1 for 1 army deletion) are simple, but keep the game very tractable/strategic. Two minor points of critique: (i) I adore army building, but have to forget about that in this game :), (ii) it appears scoring nine victory points is a very large amount...

RATING: 5
A light conflict game with rondel mechanics. I like the concept but not the execution. It seems that if one player drops behind in a turn it's very very difficult to recover from behind. In a sense it has an abstract like touch and I think that a little more randomness and historical detail would make it a better game. Played in yucata.de

This may be THE game for me. I am a war gamer at heart, but my wife won't tolerate their rules complexity and theme. I also love Civ games, but my wife won't suffer through all the steps per turn, building tech trees, etc.

Well, Antike Duellum hits on both the Civ and war game levels, and my wife really likes it. This game is tense from the very first turn. It has excellent pacing. Our first game ran just around two hours. The first half, your peacefully building your own civilization. Then, all of sudden, that board is too crowded and that's when the gloves come off! Excellent game. It's instantly right at the top of my favorites.

A very good game. Combining rondel action, with dudes on a map, special event cards which operate as a catch-up mechanism all wrapped up in an ancient history theme.  Plays quickly once learned and would reward repeated play.  

Lots to think about and different strategies available (develop vs spread out, tech vs economy vs military).  The usefulness of gold seems to disappear by the end game (as the techs have been bought and sufficient units recruited).  Marble is useful all game, whereas iron is more useful from midgame onwards as players try to arm and battle to claim the final couple of points.

An easy 8 after first play, may go higher.

A solid 2-player game, and it has made a lot of good changes from the original Antike. I feel that the race to meet a fixed amount of objectives a very good way to end a game in which there's conquering involved, as simply getting area majority just isn't that interesting as a 2-player game.

In this 2 player version of Antike, players take turns around a rondel to produce marbel/gold/iron, then build armies, move, build temples or acquire knowledge. First player to 9 VPs wins, using the Antike rules (5 colonies, 3 temples, 7 pts of ships and so forth).

This is a very tense game, and very engaging. You feel the angst about things you want to do, but don't have time for. I enjoyed playing this and looking forward to more plays.

This is an attempt rating after only two games. I am not so eager to play it again and this is the reason of the rating. Maybe I am spoiled by Polis, a much better two-players game in my opinion.

What I find missing is the strategic tension. There are cards one needs to win, but acquiring those cards is somehow not exciting as not directly related to strategic objectives. So this catching points seems a bit boring. 

I may be wrong and if /when I play it again I will update the rating. Still a rondel game, with no luck, clean rules, lot of choices: so it is unlikely that the rating will go lower than this.

-> Short turns, with many decissions in each turn and none of them will really make a difference. Can make the game slow with certain players who take their time.
-> Game very balanced (maybe even too much!). It's possible to win without battles, but very difficult.

Now, even when you're winning you can never lose the focus. Games are very intense.

The game is a bit dry and quite long, but overall it is very balanced. A great game not suited to everybody.

An innovative 2-player version of Antike. Antike has always been a favorite with me, but it doesn't see much play largely because I prefer my civ games 2-player, and that game doesn't seem to end well. Well, now we have a strictly 2-player game that returns to the original distillation of the rondel mechanism.
---------------------
Update: This just moved into the 10-spot for creating unbelievable tension throughout the entire game. The actions are quick, appropriately limited, and generally easy, leaving all the thinking to the strategic aspect: Do I build a temple now, or another couple of cities? Do I recruit more troops and get a technology? Do I follow behind to gather event cards or try to win by force?

I like the original Antike, so it's little surprise that I also found this solid and enjoyable. Similar to the (unpopular) three player version of Antike though, this one seems to run on too long. You felt like you've captured enough VP cards to warrant the win and then find you've got 1 or more to go and you have to cast around and make some hard yards to get the final ones. Which is no doubt a design feature, but I'm not a fan. Because the game is made up of so many incremental turns to get anywhere, I'm not sure the rondel is best suited to two players. Given I've got so far to go to win, I continually felt like I wanted to do more each turn. The obverse is that turns are very fast, but also very obviously cyclic and repetitive. But these are only observations on why I prefer the original 4+ player game (where fast turns are a good thing to reduce downtime, and threats can arise from anywhere). This version does enough to give a satisfactory 2 player rendition of the original. Not sure I need to own it, but if you can't find more than one opponent in order to get the original to the table, this'll do the job nicely.

Neat 2-player. Well thought out game. Slow building, but the gameflow is easy, and the downtime is minimal. This replaces my craving for Hellas. Has more of a Euro feel than a war game feel.

Many will find the game a little dry in gameplay and artwork.

The rondel needs some graphical tweaks for clarification. All of the English in the rulebook, player aids, and cards need better translations.

April 2015- Really enjoy the tension this one creates.

The more I play this, the more I like it. About 12 plays now.

At 6 plays in, I'm liking it more and more. Bumping from a 7, to 8, now a 9 at 6 plays. 

The game give me a tense feeling, whats your opponent gonna do? I wish I had more actions! No luck, almost perfect info game. The only uncertainties are the Event Cards, but you see those as they come up before they are played, so those really shouldn't be a surprise either.

I didn't initially like playing this game online. I almost gave up on this one from online plays. I think F2F is much better for Antike Duellum.

A rondel game designed for two. As with most rondel games you move your token around the action wheel and select one of the next three actions (or pay to select a further one) and you perform that action. You must build up your land and sea units to take over land while controlling cities and building temples. To win you must get a certain number of achievements which are all connected to controlling the board and getting more powerful. A really enjoyable two player battle game with fairly simple mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This 2 player game has it all: city building/civilization expanding, resource generation and management, tech/knowledge upgrades, recruitment and placement of militia to defend and/or conquer.  A 90 minute battle where two opposing players must interact if they want to succeed in being the first to 9 points.  Some of the points are gained quickly.  But those last 2 or 3 points can be difficult.  I don't understand why more people don't own this game.

UPDATE:  The reports about that last point or two being very hard to get are true.  The outcome may be obvious, but the actual path to get there may be a slow grind.  Some gamers like that, but it has caused the game to be unplayed for a while.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For being such a simple game, it's rather hard to do what you actually need to do. Seems like you could take several different paths to win. Obviously you're going to have to react to your opponent, but I could see multiple paths to victory.

Not sure there is a TON of replayability, but I think playing each side 3-5 times as well as the opposite board would easily get your moneys worth out of it.

The Wheel design is interesting and always push me to decide like "Should I skip to collect the marble and move my troop?", "Will he capture my cities if I don't buy troops in this round?", "Should I let him to get the event card if I get a city to get the Personage in this round?". I always found tension in this game and still not find a must-win strategy. One of its good designs is that whenever the opponent gets a Personage, you will get an event card. This may let you to have a chance to fight back, avoid to lose straight forward even you have a bad start. A well balance strategy game. Must play.

After one play: I'm an Antike fan and really wanted to like Antike Duellum, but this game didn't excite me like I'd hoped. It felt a bit mechanical, as if the decisions were either fairly obvious or else unimportant; of course, this may just mean that I don't understand it very well yet. Most of the game felt like solitaire, until the military stuff kicked in at the end: as with Antike, some direct conflict seems necessary in order to get the last point or two for the win.

I didn't hate it, I'm just not eager to play again.

Another Geek commented that the offense vs. defense balance is off and I fully agree. Any time my opponent marched at me with more than one soldier I plopped a temple down and rendered them useless. And when you DO win a battle, it effectively destroys your army so there's no real point to gathering a bona fide army together, especially since they're so expensive.

Not entirely sure what to make of game play yet. I enjoy Antike as a multi-player, and I love Hamburgum both multi and two player, think I would enjoy Imperial 2030 2 player. So I like Antike Duellum, but will need to play more to know whether it will really hold out for me. 

What I can say is that the game is superb value for money bits-wise - double-sided map, lots of nice wooden pieces, small box, pleasing art and graphic design - all for under £20: bargain. But will I always end up playing some other 2-player? Not yet decided.

RATING: 5
I could almost love this game. It's simple and plays very smoothly with no downtime. I quite enjoyed multiplayer Antike, but always felt it was a bit strange not interacting with some players far away on the board. Three player games of Antike also seemed to take a very long time to complete. This two player version takes all the best bits from Antike and refines a few ideas to come up with what could almost... almost be described as a really pleasurable gaming experience.

Where it lets itself down badly is with a tendency to drag between evenly skilled players (which hopefully they are). Seriously, the game can just go on and on and on - one step forward and three quarters of a step back. Play can devolve into a near endless stalemate of build and bash and build and bash. (I recently played a game that went for 151 turns!) It needs a more certain playing time and ending, or else it can (depending upon player style I guess), become a bit more than just a bit repetitious. Along with Polis: Fight for the Hegemony, I'm really enjoying the recent two player game releases, but Polis has it right with a limited number of rounds.

Where it gets it right... well, just about everything else. The rondel just works so well. Fast turns, simple and certain battles, the new event cards and how they're acquired. Even a 151 turn game you can polish off in under two hours, and there's a lot of good, fun and interesting choices and risks to take over all those turns.

JVMF Auction gift cert purchase.

The games are just too tight.  All the games I've played have ended with the other person being able to win on their next turn or two.  And you have to do a little bit of everything to possibly win - there aren't really any different paths to victory, just different orders in which you do the same things.  

Overall just a slightly boring experience once you realize that each game plays out the same way.  I suppose it's possible that it's just a problem with me and the people I play with, but I don't know if I really enjoy it.

Rating after reading the rules and playing first game solo to digest them and understand the flow.

I am growing to be a fan of Mac Gerdts. Very clean rules. Very short and simple. Very unique style of design, his games play like nothing else. Rondel makes the whole thing play very fast. Well done.

This is a Weuro in a small box, playing in a short time. A very good choice for 2.

UPDATE> Excellent, one of the best choices for a 2 player game. Maneuver, some economy and the rhythm of the Rondel is always a challenge. There may be some problem with the endgame which is only a matter of time, I mean who will score first the final 1-2 points. But I'll check that in the following sessions.

UPDATE> As of now, it looks that the endgame problem exists- you can let all this structure that you built with pain throughout the whole game collapse just to concentrate on scoring the last couple of points before the opponent does. It offers quite a climax on the gameplay but it's inelegant.

A very well thought out 2 players war euro. Interesting as a game although, to my taste, its calculable nature subtracts a bit from the charm.

Still glad I own it as it certainly has a distinct place in my collection. Great production too.

This is a preliminary initial rating after just one play, and one where we had to hurry to finish it up. I want to like this more, as I think it's got the elements you want - some resource collection, area control, and the rondel allows you to take actions out of order but you often find yourself being a bit punished for it. Even though the mechanics are simple, I couldn't help thinking the game dragged a bit in the midgame, but maybe it will be better with future plays.

Several plays on Yucata

An interesting development of Antike, but seems too drawn out (at least in the PBW format) and a bit too much back-and-forth for me (i.e., you go back and forth undoing whatever the last player did, without either player making much progress towards actually winning the game). I'd like to try it face to face, or perhaps online live.

RATING: N/A
I've playtested the game a few times before the final version and despite some minor things I really enjoy the final result. I'm anxious to know the final version as I think it will sell very good. It's a game based on the very well succeeded Antike (first published game with a rondel) but for two players only. Very interactive as in all 2 player games but it doesn't offer too much conflict which is a positive aspect in my opinion as I like positive play more that negative.

UPDATE
Played the final version of the game and it really works well! I've played it with Mac Gerdts himself, which is the best possible opponentbI can think about, but even so I think the game has a lot going on and everything is perfectly integrated with the gameplay. A really nice job from Mr. Imperial!

Same strength and weaknesses as Antike - however with 2 players feels a little more like WWI than ancient warfare. I think I prefer the multi player aspects of Antike

Rondels have never really excited me so I didn't have high hopes for Antike Duellum. Thankfully, it turned out quite well, even if my strategy caused the game to run pretty long.

I enjoyed my first play and am keen to dig in to this a bit deeper.

See my review of original Antike. Everything about the basic mechanics applies here, but fine-tuned for the two-player experience. As a result, there is less of a slog in the middle game. I preferred two-player Antike anyway, and so this game seems like a no-brainer for me.

What I'm impressed by are the tweaks that ensure no single-track strategy can dominate. If you think you can make, for example, a military strategy work for the entire game, you'd be mistaken. The recourses are tight enough, and your opponent will be able to protect himself just enough, so that you will have to diversity in some way. And if you overcommit, you may find yourself struggling to diversity when the endgame comes around. Those final 1-2 points could cause you lots of trouble.

I even like the random events, which at first seem overpowered. However, because the game is nearly zero-sum, experience will create small fights (or even a brinkmanship style standoff) over the "best" cards. In other words, they affect timing and provide a catch-up mechanic. I don't believe that catch-up mechanic is over-powered, but time will tell.

Highly recommended.

Making Antike into a 2-player game takes away the fun of playing other players against each other.  A lot of the charm of the original design is lost as a result.

RATING: 7.5
A 2player spin-off from his very own Antike. If you like the rondell mechanism and if you appreciate Antike, you'll have a hard time not liking this one. I couldn't. And personally I like the added randomness by means of event cards. For most of the time it's a a very fast-paced game with a possible chance for some AP when the game enters the concluding phase. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fairly abstract, open information, deterministic civilization game. Build an economy, spread your empire, develop technology, found cities, and dominate the Mediterranean.

The action rondel breaks up the flow of what you want to do right now with things you want to do in the future (and perhaps, that you have interest at all in), which makes figuring out what you should do a real challenge. Very strategic, very deep.

There is little randomized variability in set-up and play, so it's hard to know if this game will suffer from that, or if that will open a depth of strategies that I might otherwise miss with a bunch of changes happening every game...

RATING: N/A
Only played one partial game so far just to learn it, but it seems like a great game. It reminds me of a much more in-depth version of Hellas because it involves moving your army around a map and taking over territory based on who has the most strength in that city. It also has simple resource collection (three types of resources are in the game) and a small technology track. It seems like a fairly simple, elegant design that offers a lot of depth.

RATING: 7
I've only played this once, and my initial rating is a bit disappointing. It has some fun elements to it, like managing your resources and choosing your strategies according to those resources. But all in all, it was just a big underwhelming, and lacking in any kind of excitement.

Ash commented that it just takes a bit too long to do anything or get anywhere. Granted it was our first play, and things should speed up now that we know it. But even considering that, it seems it may have a tendency to drag on a bit.

I'm giving it an initial rating of 6.5. I'll give it at least another play to see if the experience is better when we both know the rules going in. But as for now, I'm feeling a bit underwhelmed.

::UPDATE:: 3/9/14
After 2 more plays, I felt the game got better. Then felt it go back down a nudge. After my second game, I was feeling much better because the game went a lot faster. So I liked it more. The time spent to play, seemed to line up better with the game itself. But the third game gave me the feeling that it's going to start to feel a bit samey. And that was even from a game played on the other side of the board.

I'll probably give it another go, but if it doesn't show me something different, it probably will have fun its course for me.

I can apreciate how much effort has been taken to make a solid game for 2 player. I love its 'lite Civ' feel, with many paths to develope, and works with 2!.  Rondel system is simple and deserves depth without randomness to the game. The down thing is that games among leveled players could drag to 90 min or more, too long for what it is.

Tweaks the base game to make it playable with two, which is a big plus. However, it's still Antike-length long in the time department, meaning that it won't hit the table as often as other 2p games.

I really enjoyed this 2 player game with a rondel. I think this is the first time I'ver tried a rondel game. The game has no luck really besides some card draws, but battles and just about everything else is completely deterministic. Very fun!

Très bon jeu à deux en apparence. Il raccourcit le temps de jeu de son frère Antike. Malgré des améliorations pour éviter un basculement du jeu à l'avantage d'un joueur, le jeu reste déséquilibrer. Un joueur qui réussit une avancée (construire une ville, accomplir un objectif) permet à son adversaire de piocher une carte. Ces cartes donnent des avantages temporaires pour le joueur ou contre l'autre joueur. Mais le concept suit une logique de jeu d'échecs. Au moment où le jeu bascule à l'avantage d'un joueur, il est très difficile à l'autre joueur de revenir. À partir de ce point de rupture, si le meneur joue bien, l'autre joueur agonisera jusqu'à la fin car il n'y a aucun hasard. Le jeu est purement décisionnel comme aux échecs. Alors c'est une agonie à deux car les joueurs doivent subir la longue fin de partie.

The same story as with Antike: sometimes it drags and feels very repetitive - especially if you're into one given strategy. If you like Antike, it's a must buy. If you don't, Duellum won't change anything.

I am kind of in love with this game. It is smart, lean and captures much of what makes 4x games great (however, note that there is no diplomacy, outside forces or even eXploration here - this is mostly a worker placement-like Euro game with resource management & area control). I was looking for a 2-player civ light, and I could not have wished for a better implementation. The game feels very satisfying in terms of nation- and economic engine building and plays not too long and not too short (if anything it ends too abruptly, right when some momentum built up). I am delighted by the inlet with historical background. 

Our (limited) experience so far is different from the complaints of other players (repeatedly similar, drawn out games). In our hands, there is enough variance due to the random event cards biasing players towards different strategies.

This is a fantastic 2-player implementation of Antike. It plays like a dream, anyone familiar with Mac Gerdt's other games like Navigador or Concordia will be up and running in minutes. It features a nice mix of economic expansion and warfare, with the later telegraphed just enough by the rondel to allow your opponent to prepare, yet not so much that they can easily determine your target, thanks to the tight map.

As far as one hour war games go, this one is tough to beat.

Immediately after my first finished game at AD I must say this is a wonderful epic experience. I played it asynchronously online over 3 intense days when i went to bed thinking about the game and walking to work thinking about how to win. I want to play it on a real board game now but Antike Duellum is already to the side of Antike as my favourite game, ever. The only small defect (hence -0.2 in ranking) i can find is that cards make it not completely deterministic but, well, it can be welcomed as an interesting variation.

UPDATE:
after my first live game.
THIS IS THE GAME! this is the best 2 players game ever. Forget chess, go. Forget Gipf project and hive. Forget card games, forget everything else. THIS is the best 2 players experience you can have:
 - high tension from the beginning to the end
 - no sure winner till the last move
 - gazillions of strategies to win
 - every move is important
 - cards add something without spoiling the nature of the game
 - 2 hours of fun
 - the rhythm is always high
 - surprise moves of your opponent's makes you feel like applaud instead of getting angry
 - maximum equilibrium: every aspect of the game is important.
 - A.D. is the game that i want to talk about to my nephews, sort of "I remember when I had to destroy that last temple and..."
A MASTERPIECE, together with Antike, Duellum is my favourite game.

Two player Mediterranean empire expansion of strategy and conflict. Wage war, build resource generating cities and build temples using the Navegador style rondel. This is my favorite of the action selection rondel systems for its simplicity and cost versus need decisions. I like the strategy layer from giving consolations to the slower player; be first to invest in science and give a discount or give your opponent a free event when building cities. That is a wicked choice. Fast pace, decent escalation.

It LOOKS like a warish game, but it's not. Its a euro. And a good one. It is gleaning points, through area control and resource management, and a wee bit of confrontation, (smaller in complexity than say Kemet). 

It looks nice, has wood, and plays very, very smoothly. Not fiddly. It uses a rondel to determine what your actions in a given turn will be. It adds nothing new, but does what it does in a very pleasing and elegant manner.

It is a 2-player game only.

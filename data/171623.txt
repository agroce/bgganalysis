Very enjoyable, 1st play had a learning curve to it but flows easily after that. Nice tight game with challenging decisions. Balance is really great as well. This game has grown on me with each play and have increased the rating.

RATING: 6
Decent enough dice placement game held up by the interesting asymmetric player powers. The game actions boil down to get resources, travel, complete contracts - would've liked a bit more breadth. And a personal pet peeve is the character that gets to choose his die rolls - boring!!

I have however found that online plays don't quite sell the full potential of some games, so I'd like to try this in person.

RATING: 7
What's all the fuss about? The game is good, but not particularly interesting. Have to give it more than 6 because it felt balanced and rather elegantly designed despite the variable player powers. Would definitely play it again but will not acquire. Surprised it is so highly rated.

RATING: 8.5
A game of 5 rounds where you use dice as an action limiter, and attempt to score the most points in a variety of ways.  The theme of travelling Asia is present but definitely thin, there is significant variability in gameplay due to setup and asymmetric characters, and it has a definite "I want to play again" factor to it (likely due to the relative shortness and variability of gameplay).

The game is for 2-4 players (it scales very well), it lasts 5 rounds, and each round the players roll their personal 5 dice of their player colour.  These will largely dictate what actions they will select with their dice that particular round.  On a players turn, they do one and only one main action but they have the option of doing multiple bonus actions before and/or after their main action.  The actions are: 1) collect money (at best it's 5 gold), 2) go the market, where there are several goods that can be "purchased" (camels, pepper, silk, and gold, listed here in increasing value and difficulty to obtain), 3) earn the favour of the Khan, which is a simpler lower payout version of the market in essence, 4) obtain 1 to 2 new contracts (these are where you will get a lot of your points and are primarily why you need goods from the market), and 5) go travelling, which costs money and is related to the map which also often requires further tolls of camels or money (this is the other main way to score points).

Typically you will want higher dice as higher dice generally give better/stronger actions. There are some instances however, when lower dice are good; whenever a player chooses an action with their dice, other players may still choose this action but they will then have to pay in gold, therefore if you are taking an action late you will get it cheaper with low dice values, also some actions do not benefit from high dice values (earning 5 gold, often the favour of Khan, and sometimes travelling).  As well at the beginning when players roll their dice there is a small gold compensation for very low roll totals (this is very minor however).

The bonus actions are as follows: 1) re-roll a die (thus costs a camel per re-roll), 2) move a due value up or down by one (this costs 2 camels, and unfortunately you cannot wrap around), 3) earn 3 gold (this is unlimited, you do not have to pay for taking it late, but it does use up a precious action die), 4) obtain a bonus black die for the round (this costs 3 camels, and these are both powerful and limited, powerful as it's an extra die and it also allows a lot of placement freedom with the die as you cannot normally place more than one die of the same colour at the same location, but with black die you can).

The majority of points are obtained from: 1) completing contracts which are typically a mix of camels and marketplace goods and which pay out points but also potentially other goods, black die, more contracts, or free movement, and 2) movement on the map of Asia. This is an integral but difficult part of the game, as movement is very costly and the routes you want to take are often mutually exclusive to each other.  When you move into a city, you automatically get to place one of your trading posts in that city and cities come in 2 flavours small and big.  Small cities pay out an income at the start of every round, and big cities provide new die action spaces for those players who reached that city and many of these city actions provide scoring options (there are only a small number of city cards used each round from a large stack in the game box), as well as a small one-time bonus for the first player to reach that city.  You also want to travel as at the start of the game you will secretly select 2 travel cards which pay out end game points for reaching certain cities and for reaching a large number of different cities.  As well, if you can get down all of your trading posts it's worth a bonus 15 end game points and if you can reach the city of Beijing it's worth up to 10 endgame points (and it also allows you to convert left over resources into points which are otherwise worthless).

The most interesting aspect to the game is that each player will get 1 unique player character with a powerful ability and a lot of the fun and replay ability comes in trying out new characters each game.

I love this game... The different character advantages are awesome (although the Mercator is definitely broken... too much PASSIVE rewards). The randomness of the initial setup gives the game a huge variability! Lots of fun...

It's OK, but I don't think I'd play again. Marco Polo feels like a game that would have been great in 2012, but gaming has moved beyond where it's at, these days. The dice placement is a neat idea, but I didn't find this a very satisfying experience -- would need more plays to draw a final conclusion.

Very pleasantly surprised to discover this game of trade routes. It's partially a dice game so it satisfied an urge to play Troyes. It seemed inspired by Hansa Teutonica although, dice. It wasn't fluffy and I'm very interested in playing again to move from preset beginners game to more variability in different city bonuses, characters and city cards. Variable paths to victory and a tight 'economy' to get it done in. Extra camels are the raw resource for travel but are critical for those bonus actions - especially the bonus die.

Some established mechanisms mixed and with some new twists could have made for a nice worker placement game.
But the characters seems unbalanced, und so the whole game. Just getting goods and fulfilling contracts is quite easy and mostly successful (especiall with mercator), and mostly the player who almost ignores the travelling (except a few easy moves), which is suppoed to be the core of the game, wins.
Among players who have played only few games, that is. The game may turn out to be well balanced among experienced players, but it is not among beginners in this game. Furthermore it leaves a bad feeling, that the easiest way to be succesful is imore or less ignoring the whole travelling part, and simply getting goods and selling them through contracts, so reducing the game to a very simple stupid game.

RATING: 7
A dry Euro game with no thematic integration and the usual mix of network-building/engine building mechanics, this time with dice (worker) placement. It doesn't add much to the genre, but it's a perfectly good example of its ilk. You could do a lot worse, but there is nothing extraordinary here.

RATING: 8
7 plays / 3,4 players

LIKE: The individual player powers break the game and make it very interesting. Lots of choices and not many rounds to do it, keeps the game tense and interesting.

DISLIKE: Some player powers are boring. Analysis paralysis will stall the game because there are combos abound, especially late game. Lots of iconography, but after one play it gets easier.

OVERALL: This is the type of Euro I enjoy most. There are no unique mechanisms, it's all standard resource conversion, but the presentation and game breaking characters make the game exciting and tense. My only worry is that because there is little player interaction, not sure how much replayability is here. So far, it keeps getting played.

Interesting use of variable player powers.  I found the game good, but not great overall.

RATING: 7
Although it has some original appeal and interesting combinations, the dice are very fiddly. Paying your low roll to place on top is not smooth. Moving is very difficult and adds killer decisions - make a wrong move and you can't recover. It feels bad when you're behind late as well. Maybe this is a game that is just too tight? The unique player powers are lopsided I think - even though most are fine. I'll need to play again I think.

RATING: 6
The Voyages of Marco Polo will definitely appeal to everyone who like their nuts to be tough to crack. By this I mean that in the the game you experience an acute shortage of everything. You are always one resource, money or action short from executing all what you want. And this is not only at the end of the game, the pressure is constant. As a gaming experience this pressure translates to an unforgiving optimisation exercise of the use of resources and actions. You simply cannot afford to waste anything if you want to have that sensation of accomplishment. Should your steps stray from the optimal path you quickly find yourself in a deadlock from where there is no escape. 

When it comes to other aspects of the game, I find it quite interesting. Dice as workers to place is a nice mechanic and forces you to adapt to a degree since you cannot plan everything ahead. But the best thing in my opinion are the strong special powers each character and city grants. They really seem to make a difference. This creates myriad of valid strategies which, from what I've experienced and heard, are quite well balanced. This is truly a great achievement. So many ways to play, so many ways to win, you just have to find your own niche where there is less competition. However, the strong powers also add to the need for heavy optimisation. One cannot forgo their powers, since generalists who do a little bit of everything will not excel. To make the best use of your powers you have direct your scarce resources on a single goal, while pessimised moves gain you nothing, absolutely nothing.

Marco Polo has a steep learning curve and provides a subject to study for a long time. I like puzzles and I like tough games. But I reckon The Voyages of Marco Polo might be best played online, although not in a live match. This is simply because the ruthlessness of the game does not reward casual play. Personally, I do not enjoy sloppy plays, but at the same time, I do not like being the person who is APing in the table. Similarly, I detest sitting in a table where one or several players are  not even trying to win or freeze all the time (admittedly I am often guilty of paralysing myself, so it won't be me throwing the first rock and thus I am not complaining too much). 

A game that has a very similar feel and tickles the same cell in your brains is Terra Mystica, IMHO.

Lots of replay value. A longer game than the box suggests, with a complicated, long rule book. The game is better explained than learned via reading.  Typically interesting dice mechanics from the author.  Lots of fiddly bits, but these do add replayability. Perhaps it could play quicker as you get to know it better. Not sure that I prefer it to some his other games but we will see.

只聽到規則解說但沒玩到，第一印象是：配件多，設置略顯麻煩，跟許多無美術可言的歐式桌遊比起，它的美術相當棒，遊戲背景相當貼合機制，印刷色澤鮮艷(不像勃根地黯淡)，耐玩性在於1、各角色超強的能力創造恐怖平衡。2、大小城市上的獎勵設置。3、每回合五張不同的任務卡牌。4、各玩家手中的秘密路線。

針對性不高，有些競爭性但是能接受，例如搶先抵達城市領取獎勵，骰子換物資的機會成本(後家擺有人的位置需付出更高成本)

I actually like this one a little more than [b]Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar[/b].  It seems like there is a little less going on--still quite a lot, mind you!--but it seems a somewhat more approachable.  Lots of icons and ramp-up, but it plays cleanly.  Interesting choices to make every turn and doesn't overstay its welcome.  I like how the high and low dice offer interesting possibilities.  And the asymmetric characters are great!

Very good eurogame combined with resource-collecting and area movement. 
The game feels quick, it has only 5 rounds, so you have to think about each action. 
It uses dice for worker placement, which I really enjoy.
The best about the game is the unique player powers, which make really a difference! 
The game set-up is also very random which makes each game different.

+ The New Characters.

This is an amazing game, that play after play is becoming one of my favorites. First of all the production quality is top notch for a euro-game. The custom wooden components are really nice, the cardboard is thick and sturdy, the artwork is functional but also aesthetically pleasing. Overall the game has just an intriguing look when it's on the table. Going beyond the surface, the mechanisms in the Voyages of Marco Polo may not seem very innovative when taken individually, but the sum of its parts creates instead a very interesting and unique game-play. There's SO much to like in this "mix of mechanisms"!

I like that the board is divided in two sections, where your dice/workers follow different rules. I like the concept of unlocking new actions by traveling on the map. I like the fact that every time - given the enormous amount of cards in the box - those actions can create cool combos that you never saw before. I like this huge variety, that forces you every time to pay attention to those action cards, to the interactions between them and to their position on the board, before you build your strategy. Yet what I like the most about Marco Polo is its overpowered nature, which is also probably the most innovative element of the entire game. It's not just the characters, which are all very different and absolutely powerful, but a lot of the city actions are incredibly strong too!

For this very reason though it's not uncommon to find some mixed opinions about this game. Many people questioning its balance, whether is that particular character or the travel strategy or the contract strategy. Yet, while I can see how some people might get these impressions when one player starts making a ton of points out of some combo, I don't see this as a lack of balance myself instead. After all that's what the game is about for me: the exploitation of the strongest powers in that particular game. Depending on the actions that come out during the set-up and where they come out some strategy might be easier or stronger that the others, but then it's up to the player to find it before someone else at the table does. That's the beauty of Marco Polo!

Overall The Voyages of Marco Polo is an absolutely amazing game with beautiful components, that can offer a great deal of different challenges and re-playability... and I find myself loving it more and more as the time goes by. I highly recommend it to every euro-gamer out there!

1st play: Smooth well designed euro but without much to make it stand out. The elements of the game were all things I've seen before in other games, and they were packaged together in a pleasant way. That said, there wasn't anything that draws me back to wanting to play again. The player powers were interesting but because they were so strong, it essentially forced me down a particular path. Additionally, the game doesn't build from round to round, so the actions you take in the 5th round are the same as the first round, and there's no real end game.

This game is an euro with a lot of influences in the design, I identify influences from Troyes to Ticket to Ride and Bora Bora. A beautiful design with good theme, pasted, but decently. The art is beautiful and it is a very fast game for it's depth. The rules are easy to explain and the replayability is very high.

Amazing, what a great game. Every time I finish it I feel like it could/should be longer, a couple more turns at least, don't know if it's possible to house rule such thing, but I'm inclined to try it in the future.  If you feel unconfortable with the " short blanket" situation (don't know if this is an english expression, but I belive its meaning is clear)it may not please you so much, but it is, unquestionably, a game you must try.

RATING: 8.85
Believe the hype! This is a marvelous game with unending replayability. I have only two quibbles with it:
-while the rule-book is great, and the player aids are helpful, I do wish reminders had been added to the player aids about the "extra" costs for the various actions.
-not too surprisingly, VMP is very AP prone, which can lead to major problems. How?  A player can use up all of his dice before the others, and sits out the rest of his round. If he has one or more AP-prone players still playing that round, the player may have a long, tedious wait before there's anything to do again! You've been warned.

For a euro, Voyages of Marco Polo is very well-themed. I don't know what it is with Italian designers, but they seem to have a talent for wedding historical theme with mechanics.

Played this at origins '15 where it released and came perilously close to breaking my no purchasing new games ban at the con. After another play a month or so later (a 60-57-30s-30s squeaker where I lost by 3 points from bonus card scoring) it is the absolute very top of my hottness list and I cannot recommend it enough to fans of euro games, truly an exciting, addictive, and incredibly fun design.

Great dice management game, though my copy's been living at a friend's house for the last couple months.  Characters are very different which is great, action economy is solid and the way traveling works is pretty nice (though I think the middle path is a bit too expensive).  Haven't played enough to get a feel for character balance, though I think it's about right.

The last few years have been lean times for me and the eurogame, all the more so for me and Hans im Gluck.  The last game of theirs that has stayed in my collection is Egizia from 2009.  At first glance The Voyages of Marco Polo didn't look promising.  The board has a clutter which suggests that Rococo style of modern euro design where even the bells and whistles have bells and whistles and the points all have salads.  Happily, in this case looks are deceptive.

The goals in Marco Polo are quite straightforward; fulfil contracts and establish trading posts in places that secret objective cards require.  Marco Polo's interest lies in how you go about these things using the special abilities of a character and of cities where you have established trading houses, and in what you prioritise.  What drives the game is a system of dice placement that rewards being first to select each action.  The secret objectives, characters and city bonuses are all variable so this isn't a game that is solveable.  What's more, while there is no direct player interaction, the action selections of other players will certainly have you recalculating your priorities again and again. 

The gaudy box excepted, the artwork is quite good.  Production quality is decent, although the die-cutting could have been better and the self assembly box insert is pretty crap.  Judging by the size of the rules forum, we weren't the only ones left with questions.

Άλλο ένα eurogame με ζάρια και γενικό theme εμπορίου. Οι παίκτες μαζεύουν υλικά (χρυσό, μετάξι, μπαχάρια και καμήλες) και ολοκληρώνουν συμβόλαια για να μαζέψουν πόντους. Παράλληλα υπάρχει και ένας χάρτης στο ταμπλό, πάνω στον οποίο οι παίκτες ταξιδεύουν και οι πόλεις που επισκέπτεσαι είτε σου δίνουν κάποιο μπόνους εισόδημα είτε κάποιο καινούργιο action space για να βάλεις τα ζάρια σου. Όλα αυτά τοποθετούνται στο χάρτη τυχαία στην αρχή του παιχνιδιού, δίνοντας του έτσι πόντους στο replayability του.

Τα ζάρια μπορείς να τα κάνεις reroll πληρώνοντας μια καμήλα ή να το κάνεις +/- 1 πληρώνοντας 2 καμήλες. Όμως όταν μπορείς να αγοράσεις νέο ζάρι με 3 καμήλες δεν καταλαβαίνω γιατί να ασχοληθεί κανείς με το απλό +1. Άλλωστε οι καμήλες είναι απαραίτητες και για τα συμβόλαια και για τα ταξίδια στο χάρτη.

Γενικά το παιχνίδι είναι σφιχτό, τα χρήματα δεν σου φτάνουν ποτέ καθώς τα ξοδεύεις συνέχεια είτε για να μετακινηθείς στο χάρτη, είτε για να πας σε κάποιο action space που είναι πιασμένο από άλλον. Ξέχασα να πω πως ναι μεν το παιχνίδι είναι worker placement με ζάρια αλλά αν πληρώσεις τότε μπορείς να μπεις και εσύ στο μέρος που θες.

Τελικά αυτό που κάνει το παιχνίδι να ξεχωρίζει είναι πως ο κάθε παίκτης παίρνει στην αρχή έναν χαρακτήρα με μια μοναδική ικανότητα. Όλες οι ικανότητες είναι σπασμένες. Τόσο σπασμένες που είναι σαν να παίζει ο καθένας άλλο παιχνίδι. Δεν έχω ιδέα αν οι χαρακτήρες είναι ισορροπημένοι μεταξύ τους. Ελπίζω να είναι.

Καλή ποιότητα παραγωγής αν και δεν είμαι φαν της ιδέας να χρησιμοποιούνται 2 μεγέθη meeples για τα resources. Πάντα μπερδεύομαι την ώρα που παίζουμε. modest Συνολικά πας πήρε λίγο λιγότερο από 2 ώρες για μια παρτίδα τεσσάρων παικτών.

Θέλω να το ξαναπαίξω για να δω και άλλους χαρακτήρες σε δράση

With all due respect to the fans, I can't understand how this game is rated so highly.  Yes, it has _really_ good mechanisms (with one flaw IMHO) and offers diverse strategies, however all but one (or possibly two) of those strategies are _entirely_ pointless.  I can even overlook the fact that the character powers are significantly unbalanced, but what I can't overlook is that you can't compete (or even stay remotely close) unless you play primarily and heavily towards contracts - with one possible exception - and, to me, that makes for a pointless game.  As much as I liked the mechanisms, I'm in no hurry to play this again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else.

Really hits the sweet spot for me: strategic, with good depth in a short playing time, and having a broad appeal. Lots of difficult decisions at every turn. The special character powers and the randomized set up provide excellent replayability. Plays great at all player counts. 

The components are lovely and really add to the enjoyment. I found that marking some pips on the 3-value goods was helpful.

In the genre of worker placement games, there is quite a lot of competition. This game is above average, and can be enjoyed both by more experienced players and people who are new to the genre. 
There are dice in place so there is a bit of luck involved, but in general, there are more than enough options to play. In a way, you can compare it to Alien Frontiers, another dice / worker placement game that I really like.

RATING: 7
This is a nicely designed euro where you roll your five dice, then in player order, use them as workers on board spaces that provide you with resources, travel camels, or money, that can then be used to fulfill victory point/extra benefits contracts. or allow you to travel across a board to spaces which also earn you benefits, often immediately, and at the beginning of subsequent rounds.  

Once a worker space is taken, subsequent players can use that space, but the subsequent use costs extra money, which seems to be scarce in the game.   The worker placement aspect of the game worked fairly nicely in our four player game, but I tried very hard to always be first to place each round.  I did not like paying those extra costs!

The addition of seemingly game breaking asymmetrical powers for each player, drafted at the beginning of the game, definitely adds spice or interest to the game, predictably encouraging die hard euro gamers to test out each seemingly wild power over the course of several games.  

Thee powers were nice to play with, but in retrospect, they seemed a bit like adding catnip for euro gamers who are curiously and doggedly determined to prove that certain powers clearly break the game.  I do wonder:  could the rest of the game stand on its own, be of interest over repeated plays, without these asymmetrical powers?  Not sure.

Lastly, I won my first game by going very heavy on fulfilling contracts to the detriment of moving on the board.  I seemed to be the only player doing this.  Some in the comments here have suggested that this "fulfill contracts" approach is too powerful.  After only one play, all I can say is maybe.  Fulfilling contracts seemed to me to be the central purpose of the game (similar to MANY euros), so I am not quite certain as to why winning the game by fulfilling the purpose of the game is a problem.

Marco Polo is a game that could have been much better. Problem is that it isn't very balanced and it is also a little too random. Contracts strategy is way easier than travel and, regrettably, also more boring. The character powers could be great, but it's clear that some are much better than others and can really shift the balance in favour of some players. Some characters are totally dependent on map layout to be successful and most of the time the random map just does not get generated to make much sense for travelers. Luck of the dice can also be too decisive in bad places. I'd say this game has prioritized randomness and replayability before strategy and gameplay. That said, it's rather fun to play, if you accept and adapt your mind to the luck element. The game also looks nice and is rarely totally samey.

Fun factor: 4/5
Strategy vs. luck: 2/5
Mechanics/gameplay tied to the theme: 2/5 (voyages where travel isn't the most important aspect...)
Component/art quality: 4/5
Replayability: 4/5

RATING: 8
The dice rolling and spending and bidding for actions is an interesting mechanic, and the result of the goodness of it. This game gets its score solely from this mechanic, as every other element is really bad.

Everything else has from moderate to heavy faults, though. The characters are not exactly balanced and will need experienced players to know how to balance each other out. The cities have some variance to them but traveling is not that rewarding, and contracts are a mix of costly and efficient contracts, leaving you to luck in the end. Is that newbie player countering the others appropriately? Are they even helping another unknowingly? Why do i get contracts costing too much gold, needing to make an inefficient one dice for one contract replacement or a dice efficient one dice for two contracts that will be luck dependent if i wait that long?

And that is how my first play went. Four player game, one getting resources for free when others gathered resources. I had an extra contract and dice per turn, but the worst hidden objective combination ever: literally go to the farthest northern, southern, eastern and western cities. The other two players had powers inherently benefiting from travel: 0 gold dice placing and another placed houses wherever they passed. Yet, they spent all their time doing resources and doing contracts instead of traveling a lot like they should have. I got gold-heavy contracts for little points that were unfeasible to change, leaving me to spend all my dice to get gold, and give gold to my opponent. That player ended up buying contracts the whole game and just doing them for free, winning me in contracts for 2 or 3 extra and 10 total. I traveled strategically, picking very good advantages, but could only get in the end 1 point for my hidden objectives.

So those are my biggest complaints: The map is badly designed, comboing your hidden objectives is really bad since there is an extremely high variance in difficulty. The player who could drop houses wherever they passed had the tightest route, that was around 7 moves while i had the longest one with around 16 moves, mostly expensive ones, or more if i wanted cheaper moves (but would end up costing more gold instead of more resources). The third is the variable power design. It looks like it is good, but in practice it is bad when combined with the map and objectives.

An interesting dice placement game that requires planning right from the start and sticking with it from beginning to end since the low number of turns really doesn't let you dabble in the various ways without completely falling behind.

Great dice placement game, takes a lot of what I like about titles like Alien Frontiers or Troyes and then applies it to a solid trade theme, with the depth that you'd expect from the Tzolk'in design team (though this is slightly more accessible). Good components, good artwork, and I really dug the varying abilities of the characters, which ensure that there will be a lot of replay value to this as you explore strategies with each. Also like that you can generally place dice where another player has already played, only it will cost you.

Took four games to get past the feeling that I barely knew what I was doing. It's [i]hard[/i] and mind-bending far beyond what the game looks like (echoes of Agricola there). All actions are expensive, you never have enough of any resource, and at the end of a turn, you frequently have left-over dice you don't quite know what to do with. Starting to feel very well put together, and invites playing again to try and figure it out more. Speeds up a lot after the first few plays.
I suspect I'm going to be extremely impressed at how well balanced the different characters (with asymmetrical abilities) are. Lovely artwork and tactile pieces. Lots of attention to detail.

Can be extremely frustrating, though, when things just don't come together, while players with a good start will seem to snowball ahead.

Ugh. How could a dice placement game be so boring? I've found the most optimal way to play this is just get contracts and fulfil them, totally ignoring all the other seemingly cool parts of the game, like travelling or getting special powers.

Ok some mechanics don't make sense, like if you put two dice you use the smaller valued dice. If you go where someone else is, you pay the value equal to the dice you're using, regardless of what's already there.

Az utóbbi évek egyik legjobb eurogém-e. Valamiért a Kingsburg jutott eszembe róla, de annál sokkal de sokkal mélyebb, változatosabb és mindenekelőtt jobb.
Euro-hoz képest egész sok kütyü van benne, a setup se 2 perc, de ez a setup jó arra, hogy ne legyen 2 egyforma parti. A térképen szereplő városok jellemzőit random kártyákkal határozzuk meg, és minden játékos random szerepet kap, és ezek a szerepek adják a játék sava-borsát. Az alapszabályok is nagyon jól egybe vannak gyúrva, de ezek a szerepek még adnak az egésznek egy erős csavart. Az egyik, ami nagyon tetszett az a kockák egymásra helyezése. A másik ami jó, hogy a térkép tematikus. A Himaláya az Himaláya, azt nem lehet csak úgy kerülgetni. Ha valaki elindul egyik úton, az elég komolyan elkötelezi magát, és mivel összesen 4 vagy 5 teljesen különálló út van, legalább ennyi teljesen különálló kombó kínálkozik a városok tulajdonságaiból. Persze van olyan szerep vagy olyan kártyák, amik segítségével akár egész nagy része is beutazható a térképnek, illetve nem is feltétlenül kell erőltetni az utazást, lehet hogy valakinek a szerződések teljesítése szimpatikusabb. Ha nem lenne elég a városokban rejlő sok lehetőség, vannak beépített akciók is. Ideiglenesen szerezhetők újabb kockák, amik nagyon megnövelik a lehetőségeinket. A játék a sokrétűsége ellenére nagyon koherens, nem nagyon tudnék belekötni. Talán egyedül a célkártyákat érzem kicsit feleslegesnek, és a szerepek kiegyensúlyozottsága kérdéses, de szerintem mindegyikkel lehet nyerni. A játék a bonyolultságához képest egész rövid, 2 óra kb. Ajánlom mindenkinek, aki a kockás eurokat szereti.

Lots of possibilities for points in this point-salad game. Wooden components and good-ish stock of cards although the dice could be a bit heftier and the difference between goods worth 1- vs 3- could be made much better that just a tiiiiiny little bit of size difference that is sooo easily mistaken. Other than that, an interesting game with lots of replayability and cool characters, every which one of them appearing broken (will have to see if it's true or not).

Marco Polo offers you a lot of different ways to play.  Not only during one game, but the thing is that due to the random set up and the character selection, each game can be really different.  I personally don't like this fact that much, but I understand that many people love the idea.
The dice mechanism is quite interesting.
You can certainly play A LOT to this game without repeating strategies.  It looks really good, and it really takes about 20-25 minutes per player.  Even though there are quite a few choices, I think they are well integrated and is not difficult to grasp the game.  I guess this will be a hit.

Tight dice-driven worker placement game. You very quickly find out that each dice is worth its weight in gold as the costs of travel start to dawn on you. Each move matters, and you usually need some kind of a general strategy/character power synergy to be able to do well. Game seems to emphasize completing contracts, at least when playing with just two. Highly enjoyable and thinkier than it seems.

Hans im Glück mid-weight + the (Italian duo of) designers of Tzol'kin + artwork by Michael Menzel = a game I'm interested in!

Marco Polo is not an innovative game: everything was already seen elsewhere. But in this game, the mechanics conjure to create a fresh and entertaining play experience: people at Hans im Glück are masters of development, and here again they struck a perfect balance.

There is much going on: dice as workers, route building, characters with awesome powers, insane amounts of variable set-up, additional actions... but everything plays smoothly, and after the initial explanation, the five rounds of talks he game fly and everything fits nicely.

It scales decently to 3 and 2 (but don't use Raschid with 2: it removes a big part of the game with just 2...), and I am eager to play again!
The initial rating (8) could possibly go up!

Good game. It makes dice placement its core mechanism, but doesn't overly rely on rolling 5 or 6s. In fact, sometimes it greatly benefits you to roll lower numbers. The designers did such a good job of making the dice rolling feel completely balanced that, if it wasn't for the stacking penalty, I would be inclined to argue that this game would be improved by removing the dice and moving more towards a conventional worker placement. 

Each game of Marco Polo presents you with a randomized board state. To play well, you must process that board state into a workable strategy. For example, in Marco Polo, you first analyze the randomized actions and bonuses present on the board, decide what type of strategy is likely to work best in this situation, and select an available character tile. Due to the limited number of rounds in the game, you need to be disciplined in ignoring certain parts of the board that are unfit for your strategy. Does the board state and your character power diminish the importance of traveling? If so, you should consider focusing on contracts and being careful to not waste actions on unneeded travel. Does the board state and character power increase the importance of traveling? If so, you should consider focusing on grabbing bonuses early and/or racing to Beijing or Sumatra. 

Those decisions, however, have the potential for the game to fall flat for some people. For example, choosing the one-time bonuses and unlocking city-specific actions are fun. But, due to the inherent amount of randomization and the vastly different player powers, some games of Marco Polo may require a player or two to ignore those interesting aspects. This can leave the game feeling a bit dry and boring for those players.

Marco Polo is a well made game of familiar mechanisms that, despite not bringing anything amazingly novel, still feels quite interesting. But it seems to lack a hook that makes me want to play it as much as other games that I rate as high or higher. For dice-based action selection, I still find Troyes to be superior. For asymmetric player powers combined with grand strategy, I find Terra Mystica to be superior. However, Marco Polo plays better at 2 than Terra Mystica.

I love how the dice are being utilized with a twist on traditional worker placement games. Most reviews I've read said they blend multiple mechanics together (none of it is ground-breaking) but in a very streamlined manner that just works for the game, can't agree more. The game creates a very pleasant and enjoyable feeling playing it but yet interactive enough and with depth. With so many different 'overpowered' characters to choose from and a different map set-up each time, there isn't a sure win strategy - players would have to adapt differently to the game everytime.

I enjoy the theme of this game. The graphic design is gorgeous with vibrant colors. The components and mechanisms are well done. This is one of the best dice placement games available. The asymmetrical powers really get your attention in the game. You look at them and think several are broken, but I haven't found that to be the case. Their powers seem to balance out mostly. There is enough randomness to the setup to keep re-playability high. An experienced player benefits from knowing how to balance travel and completing contracts. Travel is very difficult to pull off for the inexperienced. Some characters just don't do well with it. Also, the state of the opening board makes a big difference.

VMP was good enough to replace Kingsburg in my collection. I truly enjoy games with quest-completion mechanics, and VMPs contracts scratch that same itch. I've heard contract strategies have a high win ratio, but I've won by concentrating on travel and taking advantage of contracts and city cards with movement bonuses. I also like that the game seems to be forgiving with poor dice rolling.

Really good design. The downside is that everything was there before and done better. I prefer Bora Bora, since it has more interaction than Marco Polo. In Marco Polo you do what you do, the other players do not really concern you. Also the sum of your role, your destination cards and the dice rolling add up to a big portion of randomness. It is fun to explore a given role, but you have to find the strategy suited to the role and cannot really follow your own strategy.

Due to its variable and random nature, the game can be quite swingy considering the tight economy (which doesn't really allow for the randomness).  So you'll have great games where everything comes together and others where you crash and burn.  Skilled play can take you far but you can still be derailed by a poor character, board layout, dice rolls, etc.

This is one game where we use a number of variants to improve things.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------
Whoa!  This one will be in contention for my Top 10 game of 2015 it looks like...  This one has a TON of replay-ability with all the different cards that can be in the game.  The dice worker placement in this one isn't that innovative, but it feels very different than other dice worker placement games.  Only played this one 2p so far, but wow, I was impressed.  Looking forward to playing at the different player counts.

I tried and bought this game in 2017, and was the best game of the year for me. I played more then 15 games, while other game I got that year got max 5 plays. This was the game I always wanted to bring to the table, and I think, without and exception, all the people I played with really liked it. Powerhouse of a game. And get the mini expansion if you can, brings more awesome characters to the game.

I enjoy the dice placement mechanic in this game, but outside of that it is fairly standard recipe fulfillment fare. I don't think it is exceptional, but I think it fits a nice niche as a medium weight dice game that you could introduce to newer gamers successfully.

Hard to judge as this was one of my wife's favourite games ever. For me it just felt like my brain was constantly twisted, burning and counting some f*cking camels, coins, dice or resources just to come to the conclusion that something was missing for my great plan. After 20! plays I announced that I am not ready to play ever again and sold it.

RATING: 6
This reminds me of Lords of Waterdeep with dice. The primary mechanic is acquiring goods and turning those goods in to fulfill contracts. Contracts (like quests in Lords of Waterdeep) provide victory points and other bonuses. Traveling is very expensive and not all that rewarding. You receive bonuses and additional actions for each city you visit, but they are not enough to overcome a strong contract fulfillment strategy. The variable powers are more interesting in concept than execution.

So, I played this again after many people mentioned how good it was and I should try it again. I think my issue is with the routes you get at the beginning of the game. It's very misleading, making you think that's a pretty big goal in the game, when it really isn't. It was a lot more fun this time, though I couldn't roll a 6 for the life of me most of the game. I usually want to own all of Simone and Daniele's games, but this one just doesn't grab me the way Tzolkin, Grand Austia, and Lorenzo do. I'll try again, this time this time assuming that the routes aren't important. 

Old: Usually I can pinpoint a game I really dislike, but in this game it's hard to figure out. It seems like a game I should like. But I just found it constantly frustrating. There's a constant sense of not being able to actually do what you want.

Win or lose I love playing this game.  Every game is different and the play is tight.  Always ends one round too soon and you're always left one dollar or commodity short of a final points grab.  Which comes from excellent design.  Pitch perfect med euro. Love it.

Recently traded it for Madeira, which I've wanted to play for years. My copy of MP wasn't getting played often enough and I'm no collector so I will take a break and hopefully play it on the table some time down the road. Until then, I can play it online at yucata.de... every day!

While it looks nice and has a lot of interesting mechanics, nothing in Marco Polo comes together to make a particularly fun or compelling game.  I'll play it but I wouldn't buy it nor ask for it.

RATING: 6.5
Marco Polo is a game for experienced players. You must really understand what you do and always play the way of strenght with your personal character. So a setup start of 10 VP´s for each player is recommended, so experienced players can bid with their VP´s for the 1st choice of the characters in play. Not a game that sets me in a enthustiastic mood, but already worth a play. Caution: this one can be tend to last many minutes within a turn with Analysis Paralysis player.

Nice game that has some good decisions and nice mechanics.  The "route" cards you get in the beginning can be a bit swingy because it is all luck of the draw if you get good ones you can connect or not.  Also helps to get resource generation up quickly to be able to fill orders fast.

10x10 2015. I like the dice placement mechanic here.  The dice rolls very rarely get in your way since they can be mitigated in several ways.  There's a couple different strategies- mainly traveling and contracts.  I've seen both and a combination of the two work.  The special powers are really what sets the game apart.  They all seem overpowered, which is awesome, and I'm not sure they're completely balanced.  It's obviously important to play to your power's strengths and trying out the different powers and strategies is a lot of fun.

RATING: 8
By the designers of Grand Austria Hotel, but this one is mostly front-loaded.  Prior to the game starting, players should develop a strategy for the game and try to get a special power that meshes with it (or get the special power and then develop a strategy).  That front-loaded focus makes VMP different enough that it's a game I plan to keep.

Euro clásico de colocación de trabajadores, recolección de recursos y demás. Tenemos un peón, con el que debemos ir viajando por ciertos emplazamientos del tablero, con la idea de cumplir unos objetivos que se han repartido al inicio del juego. Además, el primero en llegar a una ubicación, recibe un bonus. Todo el que llega a una ubicación construye allí un puesto comercial que le habilita para disponer de una nueva acción.
Está interesante el tema de los recursos. LAs acciones se realizan con dados, en función de su valor tendrán un alcance u otro. Si utilizas una acción que ya ha sido usada por un jugador tiene un coste adicional.
También existe una accion de obtener contratos, que cumples entregando unas mercancías y obteniendo una recompensa.

El juego es  bastante sencillo, pero da para pensar un buen rato. Hay una serie de personajes que se reparten al inicio y que le dan una caracteristica propia a cada jugador. En mi opinión, el personaje del mercader está desproporcionado. Es demasiado potente.

Está interesante.

RATING: 8
Using rolled dice as worker placement. Asymmetric power. Variable set-up.

Scales well at 2,3,4 players. 

Front heavy decision making ala Terra Mystica. This has echoes of being Terra Mystica-lite. However, the imbalance of the characters seem to be much greater than TM.

Fast play time - about 60 to 90 minutes.

The luck factor from the dice generally doesn't lose you a game - but a string of bad rolls can set you back. 

3 games in: filling contracts seems to be a lot easier than travelling.

8 games in: traveling can be done well - just harder!

Update Dec 2017. Dropped from 8.5 to 8. Some seriously broken characters. No pretensions or semblance of any balance. In fact, the game seems to thrive on the outrageousness of the imbalanced characters.

Played for the first time at CofG tonight.  Not really my cup of tea.  Basically worker placement combined with dice rolling (like Feld's Bora Bora, I think).

Did somehow manage to beat the guy who taught us the game by completing a bunch of voyages (missions).

-Traded away in a MathTrade- 

The action spaces and the map are well done but my complaint adresses to the city-tokens and -cards. Their art could be more in contrast to the background.
But this is just a first world problem.

And that's it.

The rest is just positive... This game is really elegant.
For me it surpassed Kingsburg and maybe this will happen with Alien Frontiers as well.
Although it has pretty strong player powers it feels perfectly balanced.

I'm really looking forward to playing this game for many additional times.

Very entertaining dice-placement Euro. I like the "diminishing returns" mechanic in which the first die placed either sets the minimum requirement for future dice, or requires players to pay more when they place. The contracts give short-term goals while the route bonuses give long-term ones. 

The special powers are interesting and all very good, though we've found that a couple of the characters are definitively worse than the others, especially in a two-player game (Kublai Khan, for example, is near-worthless with 2-p. when competition for precedence in routes is much less important). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Preliminary rating after 1 play with 4 players.  As mentioned by others,  incorporates many of the mechanics from both Alien Frontiers and Castles of Burgundy (to name two) in using your dice as workers.  Since I very much like both of these games,  I think this rating will only go up after further plays.

8/15/15: Have 5 plays so far and this is very, very good.  As mentioned before has mechanics from other well known games;  but is greater than the sum of its parts which make for an original remix.  Easy to teach with great components and graphic design plus a relatively short play time result in a keeper to the collection.  Rating upped to 9.

9/10/17: The mini expansion,  plus the soon to be released full expansion,  put this into the very top tier of games for me.  10.

RATING: 9
This had gotten some so-so press in the circles I travel in, plus the dice-as-workers mechanic is about my least favorite ever. So I had kinda kept my distance. But once I played it, I quite enjoyed it. The special powers of the characters and the varying city activation abilities are what make the game; otherwise there isn't a lot here, I'd say. But the various powers are cool - almost an Argent: The Consortium kind of vibe. Also nice is that at 5 turns, it's pretty brisk and doesn't overstay its welcome. Anyway, I'll probably end up picking this up, although similar to Russian Rails I imagine the life expectancy will be a bit short. Hans im Glück has also lost their edge in terms of isolating balance problems, so I wouldn't be super-surprised to find out there aren't that many viable strategies (Russian Rails had that problem). Although, I should say that I've won every game I've played with a different character card each time; everyone I play with always thinks there is one character who is overpowered, but I sincerely doubt this is true (although I do think a couple of the "advanced" ones need favorable board layouts). I do think, though, that the route to winning has to go through fulfilling a lot of contracts. Another concern is that with a lot of high-stakes decisions being made in the initial round (character choice and strategic route choice) and with a lot of up-front complexity, the game is probably a bit front-loaded and lacking in narrative pulse (the game's tension also fails to build to a climax at the end, instead sort of petering out). But that's all the difference between the good and the great; Marco Polo seems pretty good and I'll enjoy playing it some more.

Voyages of Marco Polo was interesting to check out for a play, but I'm not sure there's much there that I'd personally want to revisit. An interesting puzzle to roll your dice, and then try to decide how to allocate those dice to various actions.

In general, you'll use your dice to gain resources and money, which you'll use to travel around the board to place markers in various cities, which will give you access to more special actions. You'll also be fulfilling goal tiles with your resources, and some hidden goals for visiting certain cities.

Overall, a neat puzzle, but nothing that really stands out from the crowd for me, or that I feel would be interesting to explore repeatedly. I'd be up for it if someone else suggested it though.

Traveling around the world, picking up goods and trading stuff. I always had the feeling I couldnt do enough or had too little resources, which creates interesting decisions. Money is very scarce in this game (but then again, so are the other goods). One nitpick though, once you chose a certain path to travel, it's pretty hard to change course again, so you'll have to think carefully which direction you want to go.

I like Tzolk’in quite a bit, although I don’t own it anymore (I sold it as my brother owns it too). So I was intrigued when I got to hear a lot of high praise about this game. A clever use of dice in a somewhat heavy strategy game, lasting 45-60 minutes by the designers of Tzolk’in? Yes please! However, I’m not absolutely convinced that it’s as good as Tzolk’in.

The asymetric characters are great, although I fear that they might dictate your strategy a little too much… Assymetric abilities are generally something I appreciate a lot; it works splendid in Terra Mystica. Here, I do think that the abilities dictate a bit too much of your strategy which is something I don’t find in TM; sure, you are probably leaning in some directions in TM and other games, but when you get a guy like, for instance Marco+Niccolo Polo, you’re kind of forced to travel if you want to succeed. And with one of the other characters (forgot his name), you’re forced to do that too as you get extra points for placing your extra settlements. On the other hand, without these special character abilities, the game would be boring and lack variety.
Speaking of traveling (admittedly, after only a couple of plays), I find travelling to be too expensive and not worth the effort. Sure, you do need to get into a couple of cities to activate the special abilities, and if you get there first you get a bonus, but I find it expensive to try to travel a lot - fulfilling contracts seems easier and has a better reward. But again, future plays will reveal much more of the deeper strategy (and these further plays seem to have proved that the game lacks longevity), and again, your character kind of determines your strategy…

RATING: 8.8
Another "dice placement" game that blends dice rolling with worker placement.  This game does it well.  The variability of the characters that you gain bonuses for makes it immensely replayable, and it scales well regardless of the number of players.

I wish the building tiles A-F would move to different cities, but I am sure that their starting location is intentional.  A small nit-pick like that isn't enough to not enjoy the game.

EDIT:  Apparently there is a "variation" in the game rules that suggests that the small-city tiles be placed at various random locations (to give you a different feel).  However, after having started my last game with Kubla Khan as my character (which starts me in Bejing), I completely understand why Small City Tile F starts where it does - it would be entirely way too powerful to start in Anxi or Ormuz.

RATING: 6
I'm not sure what it is, but I just didn't have a lot of fun rolling my dice, probably because all dice are good and it never really mattered to me what I got.  I think this stems from a very open (non-blockable) set of action spaces (except for the city spaces, which seems like an annoying rule).  I do like the crazy powers and how everyone plays differently and the length seems about right to me - but the decisions don't seem very meaty and there wasn't a lot of tension.

Marco Polo is a perfect example of a game that I'm happy to play but that I certainly don't need to own. It's fine... everything plays smoothly, but the combination of dice placement, route building, resource gathering to point conversion... I've seen it all before. This particular combination doesn't add anything all that terribly novel.

I am curious if those starting player powers are balanced... some seem clearly better than others.

A dice worker placement game that I really enjoyed. I've been looking for a dice placement game that I like and I think this is it. The player powers definitely help define your strategy and what you should do in the game. So far in 2 plays I've had 2 completely different strategies, which is refreshing to see. I like how you use dice to select your actions and the huge variability in board setup will definitely make each game different too. I look forward to another play, it's a little more complex than I like, but still proves to be a good challenge and an enjoyable experience. My only concern and why this isn't higher is so far both games have been won with a travel strategy, I'm hoping a contract strategy will prove victorious in another play.

This game seems fine and attractive, but top 30 all-time?  C'mon.   The short game length does add pressure do move efficiently, but unfortunately that lets luck of the draws be more prominent (esp regards to initial placements of tiles and locale cards).  seems quirky, fun, but not approaching perfection

Played one person doing 2 players and enjoyed the game very much.  Later I've used the print and play Automa option found on the BGG forum that included some travel cards and rules you print out.  This let me play solo against an Automa player and I really, really enjoyed the flow of the game.  I'm sure it's even better with real people but the Automa player was a lot of fun as well.

Good solid Euro with an interesting theme that does flow through into the gameplay thanks to the map, trade routes and character cards. The limited turns ensure that the game never outstays its welcome. However, this can lead to a mildly frustrating experience when you never quite seem to have enough resources (time, money or goods) to do what you want to.

This one didn't live up to the hype.  Dice placement rules are wonky and feel tacked on.  Perhaps the designers started with those mechanics, but it didn't feel that way.  Dice Rolling and placement by value, but one character power ignores that.  High money cost to select travel action, but one character power ignores that.  One character power gives you a goods cube whenever someone else got some.  Just too many game breaking abilities, but they are needed to get through the tight and expensive movement restrictions.    "But, ALL of the characters are overpowered!"  They don't feel like game breaking abilities.  The feel is actually more of a broken game, but broken in a slightly different way on each players turn.  Super gimmicky!   Bonus route cards felt unnecessary and almost a distraction. Great idea and concept, but the development feels lacking in this one.  Stale dice placement.  Wasted theme.  Two plays, low replayability.  [b]5[/b]

Thumbs up from everyone in my group so far. A dice chucker where dice are actions. Yes, higher is better, but there is some compensation for awful rolls. But still higher is better. There is an insane amount of setup variety in city actions, city bonuses, character tiles, and order that contracts come out. Only thing I'm not too sure about is the balance between characters, and the degree to which they force your strategy. I wish they would have been slightly more subtle.

+ The New Characters (2015)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Despite the game's simplicity I find it very difficult to state with certainty wether the designers and developers have done a good job of it. It is about worker placement, but instead of using actual meeple you use dice. The dice in most cases indicate how often a selected action can be taken; but there are also a few spots where it determines the selection range. It is then a matter of rolling your dice, and when it is your turn place one or a few on the board and immediately take the associated action. If you want to use an action already claimed, you have to pay money. It's a rythmical variation on the usual worker placement mechanism and as such very easy to get into. So what are the actions used for: obtaining resources or contracts mostly, and then spending those resources on the contracts to obtain money and VP. You can also opt to travel along a stylised map of Asia and put up trading houses in various cities; this gives you the ability to take the action associated with that city by placing a die there. These actions may or may not be worth it. And sic transit gloria mundi.

Despite all this which is admittedly very enthusiast-family-friendly, I [i]really[/i] have very strong doubts about the game's balance owing to its asymmetry. Asymmetry is really a can of worms, both on the players' as well as the designers' behalf, so I have to be careful. But still, in the game I played using the basic characters the player who got a specific but free resource every time someone used the market utterly [i]dominated[/i] the entire game by fulfilling contract after contract to the point where it became embarassing. Now I was spending resources on actions which didn't deliver, so obviously I had it coming and then some... but when I turned the question around, as in 'Okay, what should I have done?' I came up completely empty-handed. The layout of the board was such that only one other approximately competitive path existed (simply look at what would give VPs and work out a little engine around it), and that depended heavily on being the only person to be able to use it, and not be burdened by money issues (which happened to be the case). The moment there would be competition for that path it would've lost its power. The game was seemingly lost before it began, but it took us 90 minutes to find out.

Again, asymmetries are a minefield, and because of the randomised cities layout this horrible experience could very well have been a fluke. But it leaves a very sour aftertaste in my mouth that at least one character doesn't really need to use the travel-part at all, and can ignore the important market most of the time too. (Apart from that, travel is an expensive hobby, and the bonuses for putting up lots of trading houses are very, very small. For a game which is about Marco Polo having to fight the game to travel for a bit is a big turn-off, to be honest.) I therefore fear it is the dreaded situation that although the game may eventually turn out to be sufficiently well-balanced, this particular path is simply easy to play [i]very well[/i]. In other words it is balanced VP-wise, but not skill-wise. And that is neither fun nor good design at all.

Until the inevitable discussions about the characters' perceived and actual power appear, complete with insights in how to properly play what appear to be the weak characters, I'm going to put in a low rate. For the moment I have no interest in playing again and up my skills the hard way.

[b]Update[/b] Played anew, with the character strong in journeying, got some decent traction in that I finished a clear 2nd... and got lapped within 10 VP by the character who owned the merchant. Riiiiiight.

You can tell that this was developed by Hans im Gluck based on the look and feel of the game. That's not a bad thing. As I was reading the rules, I was struggling to understand what made this stand out from the crowd, until I found the player powers from the characters, all became clear. The powers are well done as well, rather than constricting you to become an efficiency engine based on a particular premise, they afford you a special advantage that is powerful but open ended. So much variability built into the game, this is a keeper.

I appreciate that this game has a lot going on, plenty of paths to victory, and you can plot your own path. While all its moving parts can be very confusing on the first play, it gets much easier to understand as you play it more.

That being said, I just don't find it to be very enjoyable. It definitely feels like everyone is playing their own game and while you may occasionally block each other on action squares, there isn't much interaction beyond that. It can also get rather long.

I won't turn down a play of this game, but I also won't seek it out or be adding it to my collection.

RATING: 9.5
This is great mix of different mechanics brought together in one engaging euro game. This is not a light game, it needs some practice to grasp everything and play efficiently according to the circumstances, but it definitely works. It is mostly about finding the most optimal route how you should play according to your character and different game setup.

What I like:
- very engaging mix of mechanics tied together very well (dice placement, source gathering, point to point movement, character drafting, worker placement, variable player powers). The game doesn't introduce anything new (although a lot of it was new for me) but everything works very smoothly
- I have to stress that I love various power of the characters. Each of them has powerful abilities yet still they are (mostly) comparable in strength. Some of them focus on movement, some on resources (and therefore contracts) but all of them play very differently
- The setup is very variable from game to game which means every game is different and you should apply your strategy accordingly. Sometimes there are a lot of money available so you can move a lot, sometimes there are no money but lot of resources - let's prefer contracts. 

What I dislike:
- The difference between small and big (5x) resources is not very big. You have to check the resource carefully to differentiate between two sizes - the solution could be to mark bigger ones somehow, but we simply play as all of them are the same (there is enough resources for two player game)
- Sometimes (mostly when you are behind and cannot do much) the game feels like it ends before it started. Five rounds runs very quickly sometimes. But for this reason the games are tight and you are always under pressure of time (you should manage your resources carefully to do the best from it).
- The setup and tear down is longish comparing to the length of the game (speaking mostly about 2 player games). You need to play at least two games in a row to be worth the effort.
- I somehow feel that the north route is the safest and strongest among the four ways to Peking. This is different in more player games as there are more blocking, but in 2 player games I see a lot travel tickets use cities from the north. I use this route most of the times and I would prefer to have more variety (but I don't know how much it is just my personal preference and how much it this opinion objective)

RATING: 10
Great first play but I am worried that the game is too short.  Its a die roll worker placement with an interesting map aspect that opens up new actions.  Several things in the game seem overpowered ,  not just the roles but some of the action spaces.   Given how short the game plays you almost don't have time to capitalize on the coolest abilities.  

Played some more and I am loving this game

A great game involving travelling, and allowing for a great variety of strategies. Every game feels different because of the different characters, the different objectives, and the different city cards (which influence greatly how you are planning your route). Of course, the dice is a random factor, but the various mechanics of the game allow for each value of a die to have an interesting spot (and the compensation rule for a bad roll can be of great help). And on top of that, each game feels tense, because you want to be the first to occupy an action space, or the first to get to a certain city. And the game scales well with all players count! So many qualities in this game, I would play this anytime!

I was surprised how much I didn't like this. Found the game to be more frustrating than fun. Money is super-tight, and the whole experience feels just very restricting. Rolling high is almost always better than rolling low, which ultimately makes the outcome feel random and unsatisfying when you can't do what you want to do because you didn't roll high enough. I much prefer Stefan Feld's design aesthetic which rewards both low and high dice rolls just in different ways. The game also induced a fair amount of analysis paralysis at times in my game group.

It's funny, but this is my "train game."  Wait, what?

Think about it - you're building routes between cities, getting resources and powers from those cities, and using them to activate facilities at other cities.  You need to connect cities, collect resources, build facilities, etc.  It's all train stuff, just with a different theme (with zero actual trains).

It seems to me that train games are basically stock/business games, with a little bit of route building.  I like the route building, but not the business part.  MP gives me all of that.

The special powers are cool, and the variable setup (power, route goals, city bonuses, etc.) leads to very different puzzles to solve each game.  Love that - that's our favourite thing about games.  Every game gives you the same basic framework, but you need to react to the setup at the start, and the die rolls each turn.  And just like other dice games we like (e.g. Castles of Burgundy) there is *just enough* luck mitigation to prevent frustration but avoid triviality.

This game feels like Marco Polo's boat is taking on a Voyage on is full of holes and he might not make it off of shore. I'm not sure how this game won awards? Travelling is very expensive and hard to do. It doesn't even seem like a viable option when you can camp out on a couple of locations, produce goods and turn them in for points. This game is a major disappointment to me! Hopefully a second play of this game will help change my mind but on it but I can't see it being much better, in my view.

Worker placement with dice as workers. Gather resources, camels, contracts and money, and travel along Marco Polo's trail to cities in the middle and far east. Quite some different ways to mark points (reaching certain cities, certain combinations of cities, fulfilling contracts). Every player plays a certain character with a specific characteristic. It does look as if certain characters are much more powerful than others, which could trigger some pretty frustrating imbalanced game plays. The characteristics of the cities are variable, which adds to the replayability of the game.

This was so hyped up in the early part of 2016 and was a decent game when I finally got to play it. The dice drafting combined with the race to pick up resources and points in cities provides some tension among the players. The dice are fun to play with but really are a small randomizer in the game. The letdown here is the theme and how nothing I work on really matters. I could have been collecting abstract widgets instead of camels to move because they don't serve a point other than to limit players and make you spend time to earn them.

Has the same racing and option-filled feel as Castles of Burgundy. However, higher dice rolls are stronger due to the table format, rather than the variable market style tile draft in Castles of Burgundy. A good gateway strategy euro that rewards initial planning and execution. Lack of player interaction outside of the market spaces combined with the variable player powers makes it feel like everyone is playing a different game and comparing scores at the end.

I enjoy dice placement, and the number of good ways to do it seems unlimited. The way it's done here is terrific and not quite like any other way that I've seen.
As everyone says, the characters are powerful, but only a few will dictate your strategy. It's important to stay focused on fulfilling contracts. Don't get carried away with the wonderful travel benefits that your character gives you and forget the contracts.

Because of the variable setup, there are better and worse paths and characters to choose. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be alot of room for mistakes. Don't play your best game from the beginning and you're out of the race for the win against competent opponents. I've seen this in all of my games so far and it has soured some of my gaming buddies who don't want to play VoMP again. There simple isn't any catch-up mechanism and it's very easy to screw up.

Although VoMP is a unforgiving game and I've watched my gaming buddies run away with the win, I still enjoy it quite a lot. Whenever I lost badly, I could always tell which of my decisions had cost me the game.

Great looking 13th century trader-themed worker placement-based resource management Euro. Enjoy the very asymmetrical character powers and the central dice placement mechanism, but play seems strategically limited to completing contracts, with alternate VP-scoring options contributing little to end-game scoring. #OnePlayJudgement (August 2015)

After a handful of lacklustre plays online, played a live game with friends and really enjoyed it. Managing resources well so as to optimise contract completion and travel efficiently was an enjoyable puzzle. (January 2017)

Just upped the rating on this one after a couple more plays. This is an amazing game with endless possibilities. It straddles this sweet spot between heavy Euro and family game and that makes this something I can play with my family and still find engaging and challenging. I love how open and permissive the design is: I'm choosing between several good possibilities, not taking the least painful option after someone thwarted your only possible move (sit up and listen, Agricola!). My only complaint is that I wish this supported five players, not just four. But otherwise it's a 10: I haven't fallen for a game like this one in a very long time.

I tried this one once with 2-players.  I'll be honest, I just don't get the hype surrounding this game.  It's not terribly bad, but it really doesn't live up to the excitement that it has generated here on BGG.  I'd play it again if given the opportunity, but it's been stricken from my wishlist.

An excellent beautiful euro game. There are a lot of crunchy choices to make and the rolling dice and placing for actions is one of my favorite mechanisms. Reminds me of Bora-Bora. The variable powers are extremely powerful but the game is remarkably well balanced. This is thumbs-up for me. A must buy.

Players are medieval merchants, travelling and exploiting the markets of the East, by trading and fulfilling contracts.  Lovely looking worker/dice placement game, that uses dice to place actions that gain goods, trigger movement across a map that spans from Italy to Asia, gain contracts, and so on.  It's familiar stuff that feels a bit Stone Age (possibly...) but with a wide open game space to explore, and not enough time in a single game to try it all out.  Hans im Glück tend to be my go to publisher these days, as they seem to consistently maintain churn out properly developed games - and they haven't disappointed here.  Like this one a lot.

RATING: 8
Fun dice placement game, with nice components - actually there is a generous amount of stuff in the box (game is language independent), medium complexity, with swift playtime - in fact you can play this in about 45 minutes, though set up is above average.
Dice enhance what is really a resource management game, with large dose of travelling around a very camel coloured board. Which all sounds a bit bland, but the addition of the special player powers greatly enhances the replayability, which is quite obviously very high, and variability, which was already quite high with variable goal cards - like tickets in TtR, which also increase replayability. I did get the feeling that some characters were 'over powered' to start with, but with repeated plays I have come to realise that all the characters are good and I just very silly - though I always feel like my opponents powers are better than mine when I feel like - or actually am as if often the case- losing, usually very badly, even though I chose mine and shed tears to get it. Whoops. 
So you've got a delightful, almost family weight - depending on your family - medium weight euro with nice bits, variability, and who doesn't like rolling dice? Nothing really that innovative; my only problem with it is that I quite like it, rather than being ga ga over it.

A complex but not complicated game. First play with 2 people felt balanced and I look forward to trying it with more players. While it took time to get thru the rules I felt the estimated time to play per players was close to reality, once you know the game.  The limits on the actions you can choose on each turn is what gives this game its complexity without being a brain burner. The element of randomizing your player, contracts available for selection, city rewards and actions for each game makes gives this high re-play-ability marks without being boring.

RATING: 7
A very solid and enjoyable mish-mash of dice allocation, resource set collection, and network connections.   Perhaps the signature mechanism is that the lowest value of a group of dice determines the strength of an action and also the cost if you are not first in that action space.   Money is tight and map movement is therefore more difficult than it might seem.   

The small vs large bits (1s vs 5s) are a little hard to distinguish, but other than that the production is nice and pops in a very polished, if familiar, way.   The special abilities and variable setup should help with some replayability, but I wouldn't expect to get 20+ plays out of this, realistically.   Still, it is an enjoyable game and one that I would consider adding to my collection perhaps.

This game deserves the love it gets. Two main strategies (contracts and travel) present themselves, but the different character powers and great number of city action cards make each game feel different. The challenge is to see how much you can accomplish in both strategies. Game play moves along steadily, and quick turnaround between rounds keeps the momentum going. Artwork is lovely and graphics are clear. It's the total package.

RATING: 8.5
Marco Polo is brilliant.  Think Feld's Bora Bora, think Stone Age, think Ticket to Ride, think Village, think Alien Frontiers, think them all then think again.  This game takes bits of many many things and creates something very unique and very special indeed.  Freshness yet familiarity, which are not natural bed fellows, but when you suceed in combining them you have a winner.  This is something bigger than the sum of its parts, something that brings a smile to your face just to think about it.

The game itself is very very good.  What sets it apart and creates something brilliant are the character powers.  Each player has a power which isn't just a minor improvement but a wildly powerful improvement.  Think the differences in the Terra Mystica races, then add some more power asymmetry.  Of course we rely on the game having been sufficiently play-tested to create equality in these huge differences, but this is a 
Hans Im Gluck game so we should have confidence.


This is my game of the year so far, and better than any new heavy Euro I played from 2014, and I doubt anything will come close in 2015, even with Essen around the corner.  Where will it end up after some time?  After one play it is tough to say, but whilst it might not reach the giddy heights of my top heavy Euros (Terra Mystica, Agricola, World Without End), it should settle to be the equal of the ones I personally rank just below the untouchables (eg. Bora Bora, Hansa Teutonica, Lancaster, Ora & Labora, Navegador, Goa...).

Deep joy.

  Love what the player powers bring to the game. The game play is solid all around. There is a lot to do and you have to maximize your turns. Travelling is hard, thematically so because I'm pretty sure it was not easy for Marco Polo back in his day either.  Dice worker placement done well. You want to use that spot that is already taken, fine go ahead but you will have to pay the price to. Looks great on the table. A huge plus is once you get the rules and turn flow down the game really flies by with the limited number of rounds. Excellent all around.

Worker placement euro with resource collection and secret objectives. The game has mechanisms that feel similar to Troyes and Stone Age, two of my favourites.

Marco Polo is an excellent dice-based worker placement game. There are a fair number of these now: Alien Frontiers, Kingsburg, Stone Age, etc. Marco Polo is a heavier, more thought-provoking game than all of the previously mentioned titles. Beyond that, Marco Polo is unique in the fact that it has powerful ameritrash-levels of asymmetrical player powers. For example, there is a character that doesn't roll his dice... he places them on whatever side he wants. 

Players are mainly trying to collect resources to fulfill contracts and get money to travel to the cities on the map. The player power you get will help determine your focus or balance. The game has an extreme levels of variability due to the player powers, the randomized action spaces/incomes on the cities, contracts, and hidden city objective cards. The game is not perfect however. There are some small fiddly rules that are easy to mess up and different areas of the board have different dice placement rules. If you're willing to put in the effort though, this is a wonderful game.

This game is fantastic. The five rounds pass quickly, but the game always seems to end right at its peak; a characteristic I greatly appreciate. The player powers are incredibly strong, but seem to be at least moderately balanced, and they inject loads of replayability into the game, as do the various city actions, and town bonuses. The theme may not be very strong, but the mechanics are surprisingly elegant. Actions are never blocked, but you'll have to shell out big money if you keep taking actions after your opponents. Strategies are plentiful and balanced, and there is always something new to be learned. If find myself thinking about this game long after each game session, and am perpetually awaiting my next play.

You do have to play a few games so you get the hang of it. There are multiple goals you try to accomplish and the timing of when you do what is crucial.

A big plus is certainly the different player powers. Figuring out which one fits your play style the best is pretty cool.

The game is not without its flaws. For instance, traveling to certain cities gives you access to additional spots to place your workers. But very often, I found that those spots are not even worth the hassle.

Overall, an enjoyable experience.

Voyages is another game that restricts players' actions throughout the entirety of the game. Players only roll 5 dice per round (there are exceptions) and must use those dice to activate areas of the board that allow travel and resource gathering to fill contracts. Sometimes high valued dice will be wasted because everything is based on the lowest valued dice. Sometimes a player may only have 2 actions over the entire round while another player may have 5. It's a fast paced game that allows for a lot of depth and stressful decisions.

My friends liked this one more than I did. 

The map game felt slow. It was so expensive & difficult to move. It felt like you were spending multiple turns preparing, then not really getting much out of it. Beyond the map aspect of the game, it just seemed to be placing dice to collect resources or money to fill basic contracts. There wasn't really an engine aspect to the contract game. Just place dice & collect. A movement engine is possible, but due to the variability of initial city placements, movement strategies just weren't very viable in the majority of games. I'd rather play other worker placement engine building games which don't include the die blocking aspect, which makes doing actions even more expensive, in a game where everything already costs too much.

This is my opinion after just one game.  A very well-done mix of some popular mechanics, with nice components and clear rules, and lots of replayability.  I love the strong asymmetric character powers.  

Personally I'm not a fan, overall, because a mistake in initial card choice before the first turn is going to set you back the whole game.  This is particularly likely to catch newbies who may misread the graph.  Even in TTR you can minimise your number of initial destination tickets and draw new ones later in the game.  This issue can be tackled by the teacher stressing to newbies to make a full analysis at the start.  Fun?

So many disposable camels... Doesn't really do anything for us.  Is it a travel game?  Is it a trading game?  Well, just depends on who you get.  With only two players it could very well be you're simply playing different games on the same board rather than playing a game together.

The above coupled with the choices not being very interesting in comparison to other games means this one is probably going to end on the chopping block.

There are many things I like about this game. I like the mix of fortune and strategy, and particularly the fact that the former doesn't dominate by any means. I like the character powers, which lead to different playstiles. I love the components. 

Why, then, do I give it only a 6? Two reasons: first, the rulebook could have been organized A LOT better. It's sometimes hard to find important information if you can't remember it. Second, and perhaps more important: the travel mechanic, that I feel should be central in a game about a famous historical traveler, is underwhelming. If you don't have a character who STRONGLY encourages you to travel, doing so is quite impractical: it costs you two dice every time, and it has the potential to cost you a ton of money and a ton of camels. In all the three games I played, the winner was the player who stayed in Venice or close to Venice and spent all their actions to fullfill contracts. Objectives are worth a ridiculously low amount of points, not enough to justify investing towards reaching them, and the town bonuses might or might not be worth it, given that they are placed randomly on the map. The end result if that you don't use a core game mechanic and a good half of the game board most of the time, which is just sad.

A straight forward worker placement game, though much better than most of them. Really like how they have implemented travel into the game play. I also like the extremely powerful characters, which make a new play feel very different from the previous one.
However, what really makes the game for me is that you have to pay money equal to your lowest valued dice if you are not first on a location. That makes you want to keep low valued dice for later use. This also reduces the luck factor of rolling low valued dice vs. high valued dice.

After 3 games this is my favorite game alongside Kemet. I was afraid that luck of the roll would ruin the fun in a euro game but I've not found it to be the case. What is important is to be able to read the map before choosing the character, similarly to Terra Mystica, and to use timing in getting the actions you want in order to save money for travelling. If you stay in Venice you'll most probably lose!

RATING: 6
It was good.  It ran a little long with 4p and 3 newbies, I think it would be better with 3.  The dice were interesting; in general, you claim an action by putting a die/dice in a row; some actions require 1, some require 2-3 dice.  When it requires more than one die, the column you pick is dictated by the *lowest* die in your group.  Also, if somebody is already in a row, you can still place but you must pay money equal to your lowest die first.  You can then take the action dictated by that column, or a lower column if you want.
So higher dice aren’t always better; they’re more expensive to use in some cases, so the order you pair up your dice becomes critical.

This still stands as my best game of 2015.
I really like how the characters each individually seems totally broken, but since we all got a 'broken' ability it evens out. :D I also like how much randomness you can get with the setup. And I like how the subtle interaction really can screw with you and you have to think about when to actually do the travel if you want to be first player.

Some minor dislikes is how horribly the randomness of the expansion tiles can strike for someone who completes a contract with them. A tile with '1 point for each completed contract' just at the start of the game is sooooo much worse than getting a free movement for instance. I also am a bit scared about how swingy the starting 'ticket'-cards can be if someone is able to get two cards that really suit together AND also has a random setup that gives a good combo on the city-cards. I also dislike how important contracts are, but that is just my taste since I find them boring in contrast to traveling.
But. . those are still minor complaints. I REALLY like this game.

Current rating: 9 (leaning a bit towards 8, but this has held up for quite a few plays and deserves a 9)

DEC 2017: If you've played the other "Italian dice euros" (Grand Austria Hotel, Lorenzo il Magnifico), then you know what to expect. A more systems-focused euro that has scarcity at its core as players try to complete trade contracts, travel for markets, and complete trade routes. A great thinky euro for those who love this sort of thing, and the setting of Marco Polo's travels is a nice change-up. One of those 10-plays-and-done puzzly euros: for my tastes, once the puzzle has be played a few times, I lose interest. I prefer more combo-heavy, more variable games such as Grand Austria Hotel.

I predict 10 or less plays, and the rating to float from 8 to 6 over those 10 plays. Just not enough of what I want from a game.

A game in which you only have 5 rounds to traverse as much of the board as possible. Every turn is a puzzle in how to most efficiently use your resources and powers. And I absolutely love the puzzle.

The tightness and efficiency in design is something which few other games can emulate.

C'est bien huilé. Ca a une bonne rejouabilité grace au plateau variable (très long à mettre en place) et aux personnages à très fort impact. Mais c'est froid et pas trop immersif. Les objectifs sont assez peu éuilibrés; ils lesont individuellement mais come on les pioche par 2 certaines combinaisons proches sont faciles et d'autres infaisables. Cen'est pas nul loin de la; j'y rejouerais volontiers mais c'est un médiocre Agricola / Caylus finalement ...

Interesting roll-and-place mechanic, with just enough random to make it interesting and just enough thought to make it challenging. It plays pretty quick for what it delivers and leaves a feeling that one would like to play just one more round. Somewhat unbalanced and a bit too much luck, especially if playing against certain characters.

Kicsit vegyesfelvágott euro, amiben azért elég sok játéklehetőség rejtőzik. Nem voltam vele 100%-osan elégedett, de mégis rögtön a következő partyn, sőt partykon törtem a fejem. Szóval azért olyan rossz mégse lehetett.
Nagy újrajátszhatóságot adnak a karakterek, és a mindig változó tábla, ami szerintem jó eséllyel alapjaiban változtatja meg a nyerő stratégiát, ha már van némi rutin ahhoz, hogy ezt át is lássuk. :)
A kockalehelyezős részben volt némi csalódás, mert azért simán lehet rosszat dobni. Annak ellenére, hogy a kis kockákat is fel lehet használni itt-ott, Azért összességében sokkal jobb a nagy dobás. A kockaforgatós képességeket meg túl drágának éreztem a hasznosságukhoz képest. Logikusan 5-6-ért senki nem fog újradobást reszkírozni, mert semmi értelme. Az egyet hozzáadás, pedig két tevéért azért drága. A plusz kocka vétel esetleg még a reális opció, bár 3 tevéért az se olcsó. Jó lett volna több machinálási lehetőség, kicsivel olcsóbban, hogy kevésbé számítson a dobás maga.
Fura volt kicsit a térkép, nomeg a ezzel együtt a hálózatépítéses célok is. Nem értem miért kellett gyakorlatilag 4-5 teljesen különálló útvonalra bontani a térképet. Olyan kevés a lépés akció a játékban, hogy ha elindulsz az egyiken, akkor esélyed sincs már átmenni a másikra. Ez viszont kellemetlen a céloknál, illetve ha valaki elindul a nyakadba ugyanazon az útvonalon, amin te, akkor logikusan sokkal nehezebb játékod lesz, mint annak, aki egyedül császkál végig egy úton.
Node kell még játszani vele mindenképp. :)
Egyelőre egy vegyes hetes.

The Voyages of Marco Polo is another variation on the worker-/dice-placement mechanism and as such only offers a few small tweaks to games you have seen elsewhere before. It is probably a little more variable (thanks to the setup) and a little less interactive (thanks to... well... almost no interaction; even the typical blocking of action spaces is heavily nerfed) than most but if there is a property that sets it apart from most competitors it's that the selection of a character at the beginning of the game strongly guides your strategy right from the start.

The relative merits and strengths of those characters have already been discussed quite a bit and some say that since different people consider different characters to be vastly overpowered, the game should be fairly balanced after all. And they might well be right. At this point I'm at least cautiously optimistic. I do still consider it a possibility that different characters are vastly overpowered depending on the random starting setup, however, and that would mean that it just takes you 60 to 90 minutes just to see who took the most valuable character at the start. That would be a pity!

RATING: 8
Interesting mechanics with variable player powers and attractive theme and art, but ultimately doesn't feel tight or purposeful enough to really move beyond another -
 albeit solid and engaging - resource trading game.    One is not really building an engine but rather building opportunities that can really multiply... but for what?  Ultimately, the multiplicity is really intriguing so I can't hate hard on it.  Best suited for those who play board games primarily for strategy and tactics via randomness from dice.

Das Studium der Regel lässt zunächst nichts Neues erkennen und ist schnell verinnerlicht. Das Spiel selbst entpuppt sich dann als überraschend knifflig und klemmig. Viele Wege führen durch MARCO POLO. Das liegt vor allem an den verschiedenen Charakterkarten, von denen man zu Beginn eine auswählt, die eine Richtung vorgeben, aus dem man dann idealerweise einen flüssigen Motor baut: diese Überlegungen zu Beginn des Spiels sind bereits Teils des Spieldesigns. Viel Zeit bleibt einem für den Motor aber nicht, denn ruckizucki ist das Spiel finito. Zudem werden in jeder Partie aus einer Vielzahl Stadtkarten jedesmal andere neu ausgelegt, was MARCO POLO ebenfalls sehr dynamisch macht. Dieses stetige Neu-Entdecken durch den variablen, asymetischen Spielaufbau ist das Trumpf-Ass der italienischen Kreation, die sich mit jedem Aufbau neu erfindet und passt noch am ehesten zum Thema in einem ansonsten klassischen Euro, das in seiner erfrischend kurzen Spieldauer eine enorme Spieldichte aufweist. Masterpiece.

I love this game and would propably give it a 10 but the startplayer mechanism is crap. You can play for getting the startplayer and al other players are placed in seatorder so when the player to my left manages to get the startplayer I'm on the worst position without any compensation. Moreso once you are startplayer it is often easier to become startplayer the next round too - it is propably not the best strategy but it is not terrible bad either. So siting to the right of a playe who invests strongly in becoming the startplayer as often as possible s a big handicap.

Dice placement game of building trade routes and exploring Asia.   Most unique feature of the game is the powerful starting abilities for each of the starting characters.   All are extremely powerful and guide the strategies for the player.   This creates incentives to pursue a variety of strategies in each game. As a downside, it's possible that the powerful starting abilities could feel like you are being rail-roaded into a specific strategy. I think it's more positive than negative, but wanted to make the observation.

I must say that given the familiar mechanics of a dice game, Marco Polo has a great deal of breadth and depth that really help make it feel singular among all of the games of this type.  Lots of interesting decisions to make, very easy to understand and yet lots of nuanced things that you won't truly understand until multiple plays. Tons of replayability with modular action spaces. Presumably a very tight game as well, and amazingly well-balanced considering how different the roles and actions can be. A very interesting game and very well constructed. Can be a little AP and there are times where you are finished your turn before everyone else, so you just sit around for awhile waiting for people to finish. Also, some parts of the game (like the contracts) feel so Euro-y in terms of "trade this-for-that" that it can take you out of the theme. Those issues aside, two strong thumbs up.

Marco Polo scales very well, two player games gallop along to a conclusion within 45 minutes. It is extremely satisfying to discover a clever synergy between you character, the city abilities and your end game city scoring cards. I generally like strategic dice rolling games and Marco Polo has just the right balance of actions available to let you progress your plans, but still end up wishing that you had another action or two. It is not as complex as Castle of Burgundy, but gives you more to think about then Kingsburg. I would suggest that you put any initial concerns regarding balance on the back burner and play the game a few times to explore its possibilities. Hopefully, you will come around to appreciating the bold decisions that the designers have made.

Lots of different characters,  city cards,  and contracts to keep different plays dynamic.  Great use of dice and fun to creatively min-max each turn and your overall strategy,  which needs to be heavy on contracts. Too bad a travel heavy strategy isn't supported.  Should have been. 7 extra points for contracts can only create a run away leader problem.   Should have awarded more for goal cards or trading houses and 10 point bonus for most trade houses placed to balance that or remove the contacts bonus completely.   Still a lot of fun and players knowing the game will value actions correctly.  Great components too.

Enjoyable solid Euro.  Dice allocation game, with nice variations in mechanisms limiting possible actions.  Large strategic space to work in, not quite 'point salad' as you get some clear rewards for concentrating on certain paths.

Loved the game, is more worker placement mechanic but with something different. Your worker are your dice, but, being quite important, the number you roll is not the thing getting you out of the game. The idea of paying when doing the action another player took is a good one. I liked also the different power of the players, and, as I have heard, on each game you will see that other players have more power than yours, no matter if you have played with the same character previously

Playthrough videos got me really excited to try this game out. Bought it from BGB in 2/2016. Played it 3 times (2p only) and was underwhelmed every time. I'm still interested in the dice worker placement mechanic, but the decisions and resource management in this game felt uninteresting--get camels, use camels to fulfill contracts, score victory points. Wash, rinse, repeat. I sold it in 4/2016, but every so often, I have an urge to pick this up again. I am a sucker for hype, you know.

I'm raising my rating after a second play now that I have more experience with the game and have seen the majority of the special powers in action. However, I still need to play this more to solidify my feelings. I feel like there comes a point in every play where you stop doing stuff and pivot over to exploiting the living hell out of what you've done to that point, and that's a bit unsatisfying for me. I feel like I play 60% of the game and then do the same things over and over to gain victory points for the last 40% of the game. So far I've played the game twice and have found new things to complain about. But this could be a lack of experience. I think the game is fascinating and I want to keep exploring it, but I still think I like Tzolkin, Lorenzo and Grand Austria a bit more.

While I like the way dice are used, the role cards are ambiguous. Firstly, they urge you to follow a certain strategy to get the most of it. Secondly the bonus they offer are not of equal value. Get a weak one and you have lost.
And what's the point of a role card where you don't have to roll your dice anymore (in a dice game)? Gameplay turns out to be rather bulky instead of smooth (4pl). 
Due to its imbalance it should not become Kennerspiel 2015.
Traded away after a few games due to low replayability.

Played once 2 player completed in under an hour without rushing. Fine as a 2 player game but I am sure I will enjoy it even more with 3 or 4. Likely to be my favourite game of 2015.

*UPDATE* Now played 5 games including all player counts. Clever clever game. Maybe not quiet up to the innovative brilliance of Tzolkin when played with its expansion but still a solid Euro. I would now buy blind the next game Simone Luciani and Daniele Tascini create. July 2015

*UPDATE* Played 14 times, my most played game of 2015 and easily my favourite. The expansion will see it getting many more plays in 2016. Deserves to be rated a 10. Dec 2015

A German puzzle Euro that focuses on a nice mix of tactical and strategic decision, Voyages of Marco Polo is an action selection game via dice. Throughout the game, you travel with a focus on set collection to complete contracts and managing resources for future planning. The planning is forgiving, as most choices only need to be thought out  one or two turns in advance. Many games do the same things as Voyages, but Voyages of Marco Polo is (mostly) pleasant to play and friendly in its willingness to let players plan their next move. At times, it can be stressful trying to achieve plans, but when successful, makes them that much more rewarding.

It's a dice placement game where rolling higher is strictly better. The rules even offer some form of compensation if you roll too low. Also,  it is completely abstract, basically about resource conversion. Visiting cities can give you various bonuses and open up new action spots for you, but you can win without ever traveling - and that feels wrong in a game called "The Voyages of Marco Polo". It works, but it's not quite engaging and I have concerns about balance.

A Selyemút nyomán
A játékban kalandor-kereskedőink (Marco Polo és barátai) az Európától keletre, délkeletre eső területek bejárásával és közben előnyös kereskedelmi szerződések megkötésével igyekeznek minél több győzelmi pontot megszerezni. Több út is vezet a sikerhez: bizonyos helyszínek meglátogatása, a helyszínek elsőnek történő felfedezése és az előjogok begyűjtése, Pekingbe történő megérkezés, kereskedelmi szerződések teljesítése, kereskedőállomások létesítése, a már létesített állomások képességeinek kihasználása (illetve ezek megfelelő kombinálása). Mindez nyakon öntve tevékkel, árucikkekkel és kockadobással. A filmek kapcsán beigazolódott mondás itt is igaz: „mindenki nyúl le ötleteket, de valaki ezzel sem tud mit kezdeni”. Sok más játékban már megismert játékmechanika köszön vissza ránk egy nagyon kellemes elegyben. Kis kockadobálás, munkáslehelyezés, a helyek korlátozott száma, árúk gyűjtögetése, majd célok (itt szerződések) teljesítése, …
A rengeteg lehetőség (és annak játék eleji megfelelő kiértékelése) miatt inkább már haladó társasozóknak ajánlanám, de nekik mindenképpen egy próbát megér.
A sok pozitív élmény mellett játék legnagyobb negatívuma számomra a benne játszható karakterek kiegyensúlyozatlansága, amely játékosszámtól függően is változhat.

as mentioned before, this game doesn't nothing new but does a ton of things well. Great implementation of Dice as workers. Multiple ways to win, concentrate on doing contract, or specialize in exploration or a bit of both? Players each start with a character with powerful different powers which will help you toward one of the strategy.

Buen juego, pero un poco complicado al momento de tomar decisiones por las distintas opciones que hay. Es un juego que agrupa muchas mecánicas de otros juegos (Troyes, Ticket to ride, Stone Age, Bora Bora, etc.), logra hacer que el jugador se enfoque en los objetivos, pero son muchas las formas, y eso lo hace complejo. Es recomendable para jugadores con experiencia, curva de aprendizaje alta, escoger la jugada permite un tiempo de parálisis alto, y las habilidades creo que están algo desequilibradas.
Los dibujos y las fichas son de bonitos detalles y buena calidad.

Here comes the next new game that doesn't differ from many older games and yet, it rates high...

It's a fine game, but like many other newer games, I prefer older games over this one, as everything has been done before a thousand times. There's nothing wrong with this one, it just doesn't offer anything new. I don't need the 99th game of getting ressources to convert them into points. I will probably play it again, as you can puzzle around pretty much, but I will never buy it.

Rated down after a few more plays, as it just got more and more boring. There is nothing new, which is fine if the game feels different, but it's not. It feels the very same old way, which breaks it down to just another resource converting game and nothing more.

Very smooth middle-weight euro with dice use for action management, yet the rolls you get generally won't totally ruin your turns. My main concern is that the destination cards don't seem to be entirely balanced - some are extremely difficult to complete, and others are easy, and the point differences between them don't quite seem big enough. Need more plays to figure that out for sure.

There is nothing new mechanically-wise  in this game, but it has been developped by Hans im Gluck.  I did buy it for its theme and because of its Hans im Gluck credentials.  The thing is, it ticks like a swiss watch, everything flows beautifully and seems perfectly balanced.  As perfect balance is not that common, this might be where the originality you seek resides.

Raising my rating from 9 to 10! This game is unbelievable!

Was a little concerned that the contracts was a little OP, but won the game today with travel (with Wilhelm), and using the cards that I "unlocked". Sure I did a few contracts, but mostly ones giving me more travel...

After several months: one of the best games in my collection. So much FUN! The replayability is through the roof. Feels very satisfactory to accomplish all travel you wanted to and to balance it with contracts / city cards generating VPs. 

I have also new expansion characters, which are now mixed with original cast. Not more complex than previous ones. When playing with newbies, I recommend Berke Khan [no extra costs for already taken spaces],  Mercator ex Tabriz [free stuff from market(s)] or Raschid ad-Din Sinan [no dice rolling]. 

10/10 [even after new game sheen wore off]

Update: another great 2p experience with this game [and personal best score]. Will never get bored playing this!

This is a gorgeous game. I loved it the first time i have played it. Interesting dice playing mechanism with tons of depth involved. Where do i want to put my precious dices and when? Do i want to travel or do i need to get some camels first? There are a plenty of choices like this. If you use an action first it is free, but if you use it as a second you have to pay your hardly earned bucks. The characters are totally different and needs a completly different strategy to purpose with them. Their power are so strong that you might think that they are overpowered. Well the fact that yes they are but despite this the game is very well balanced. Everyone have a superpower and it is up to you to use it in full potential. The artwork is very colorful and looks great, the theme fits into the mechanism quite well. I loved this game the first time i have played and i love it even more after more than five games.

It is heavier than it first appears, but once the rules are internalized, not as heavy as you'd think. 


There is quite a bit of replayability in here, but also quite a bit of randomness in the game that players have to learn to hedge against.

I think this is one game where the more I play it, the more I will enjoy it. I really like worker placement, and, being my first dice placement game, the twist on the worker placement mechanism really intrigues me and offers more to think about. Now I have to think about which die to place, what value to put down to give me the best reward. I love that this kind of brings in a bunch of mechanisms from other games and meshes them into a solid, fun game. The character powers are so powerful that they completely change how you play the game depending on who you have, and I LOVE that. I'm excited to try them all. The game comes with a deck of city actions but you only use 9 each game, and I love that, as well...lots of replayability. I'm excited to play this more.

I played it in a tournament threetimes in a row. After the first game I wasn't thinking Wow let's play another round where I can try a new strategy. And that's one of the points here. It is not really  a strategic game. It is more a tactcal one but  it is a lot of luck and radomness in here. Somtimes if your dice result is really poor it is not even possible to make a good move. You higly depend on your dice and the moves of your opponents even your special power could. 
And at the end it's not really innovative. One advantage is that the game doesn't last too long. (2-3 Hours with 4 players)

An elegant example of how to use dice typical 6-sided in a board game in that the dice are not opponents to the players. Dice isn't used as a Pass/Fail mechanic but rather as a random element that encourages interesting choices. Neither a higher value nor a lower value is better nor worse. Just depends on the circumstances. 

The dice just lifts the worker placement mechanic to a higher level which is beautiful to see. Players don't need to "hope" for a certain dice result. Everyone just deals with their worker dices while considering their opponents. Player therefore do not "fight" against the dice. Unlike something such as Stone Age where the player "hope" for dice results and groan when they roll poorly.

A game about ruthless action efficiency. It's pretty short, so don't think you can spend the first round getting to know the system, you must touch the ground running here. All this means that there's a severe experience penalty, beginners will be up against an insurmountable disadvantage when playing against those who have played before. I do hope some effort went into balancing the special player powers, they're completely wild.

You need to explore the world, but you only have five turns to do it. It's a dice-worker game, where different numbers let you do different things. You can choose to focus on contracts or exploration; exploration is very expensive but likely to allow you different actions, while contracts are probably a little easier, but it's difficult to do a lot of them.  It's a little harder to accomplish anything in this game than I'd like.  The different roles with their powers are really cool; they are all powerful and there are lots of them. (2 plays)

RATING: 9
I really love the available decisions and resource management. The cost of movement feels different than a lot of games, and trading goods around to fulfill contracts is both satisfying, and seems to be thematically appropriate. Variable player powers are drastically different, and all seem like they have good paths to victory. My biggest criticism would be against the component size for gold bars, silk, pepper and camels. The size difference between the small (value=1) and big (value=3) wooden markers is not easy to detect without very close inspection.

Initial rating. 

It's the kind of Euro dice game that put all info on the board, with the only undetermined thing is dice rolls. As there are so many seemingly viable choices on a single turn, no doubt there is over-analyzed issue.

The travel and contract actions give most points of game, both of which are very costly, thus unlike most Euro, it feels very hard to push the VP track forward.

I don't find the dice-placement being especially intriguing, it's not bad but too much arithmetic. I will play more to find out if I like it.

So, Marco Polo...

I've had almost 24 hours to try to shed my frustration at this game. I knew going in it was a bit of a risk, but it seemed like it could work. And even after playing it, we both look at each other and say, "It's so close!" I think we are not the right audience for it.

The rules are lengthy, and seem pretty well written. However, I really wish they had had us playtest this game, and we would have pointed out the confusing parts and inconsistencies. For example, some things can be done the number of times as pips on the dice, and in some cases, that doesn't matter. In some cases the pips tell you which things to consider, and you do it once. Some things you can only do once. And yet they use the same bracket arrow symbol, and no differentiation on the card. 

Do not use the same symbol to mean very different things. 

Or at least, differentiate it with a secondary symbol so it's clear that it can be done the number of pips on the die/dice, or a x1 to show only once. Or something.

But, let me go back a bit.

Everybody had 5 dice, you roll them, and then you put them on spots on the board to do that thing. Some spots require 1 die, some 2 or 3. Most you can use if an opponent is there, you just pay extra (the value of the lowest die you are using). Some spaces (favor track), as far as we can tell, you can't share, there are just 4 spaces. Again, the same bordered dice space that works a certain way should not be used when it doesn't work that way. It should have the standard 1-die frame, meaning you need to use one die, and have a "limit of 4" notation, if only 4 dice can be used there. Or something.

I was frustrated enough at all of the symbol weirdness that I wanted to shake my fist at it and say, "Your theme is pasted on!" Really, it wasn't my main issue with the game, but it seemed a decent insult to hurl at it. 

Oh, have to go back again. I said that everybody had 5 dice, and you roll them. Hah, not true. The first player gets a character card where you don't roll your dice, you get to set them to be whatever you want (?!?). Why would I play a dice-rolling game where I don't roll dice. And why would the first player (in the beginning game) get that ability? Maybe the 3rd or 4th player. There are character cards that give advantages, like extra dice. 

Maybe, this qualifies as asymmetrical play for Bryan, and the dice and blocking and whatnot are Troyes-enough for him. So maybe, this would all turn him on. We did not play with the character cards, because they annoyed us, but we got to the end and very little had happened, so we thought, maybe we would have been able to do more if we had used the character cards. But we didn't want to. So we were in a bind. 

So you have dice with pips, either rolled or chosen, sometimes 5 but maybe more, and you use them to get goods (gold, silk, spices, camels). Mostly you get them using a big chart. There is a row of gold, row of silk, row of spices, row of camels. Then there are columns for 1 pip, 2, pip, 3 pip, 4 pip, etc. The pip is the lowest face of the die or dice you use. Gold needs 3 dice, silk 2, and spices and camels 1. So one die with 2 pips might get you 2 spices or 2 camels, but you'd need 2 dice, the lower one with 2 pips, to get 2 silk, and 3 dice, lowest 2 pips, to get 2 gold. If Sam already used that row, and I wanted silk, I may want to play 4, 4, 3, so that I get what's on the 3 spot (could be 2 silk and a coin, something like that) but, since that spot is occupied, I have to pay the value of my lowest die. So I'd have to pay 3 coins to use that spot. 

So a few of the areas are about getting things, like the goods and coins. Then there is a place to get contracts. 3 camels, 2 gold, 2 spices get 5 gold and 4 VP, something like that. Also, most completed contracts gets 7 VP. I had given up on travelling (explained next), so just churned through contracts, giving me the bonus.

The other thing you can do is travel, move around on the map on the top half of the board. To travel, unless you get a bonus somewhere, you have to go to the travel spot. You place 2 dice, and again, it's the lowest value that tells you what value you can use, but it also costs money, so even if you have the ability to move 3 spots, you might only have money for 1 or 2 spots (as often happened to us). Or even if by some miracle you had the dice and money, there may be extra costs on the map (camels, money) and so that might limit your travel. I pretty much stayed in a hotel in one city most of the game. At the beginning you get 2 bonus cards with 2 cities (think Ticket to Ride), with bonus points if you put a house on each city (okay, not a house, but wooden structure meeple). There's also a bonus table for building houses in cities on your cards, 1/2/3/4, so even though I only built 1, I got a few points for it. 

Building a house in a small city gives income of some sort every turn (5 coins, 3 coins and a camel, etc.). First person to build in a large city gets the bonus (2 silk, etc.) If you build all of your houses but 1, there's a bonus (I think 5VP), all of the houses, 10VP. We were in no danger of that. There's also a city where the first person to reach it gets 10VP, the second (7?), third (4?), fourth (1?). Sam made it there, so he got 10 VP. 

The artwork is lovely (the score track is beautiful), the components are good quality, both cardboard and wood. The character cards were tiles rather than cards. We wanted to like this game. It comes really close to a game we would like. But it's not there for us.

The base game is very, very good and I was still enjoying it more each time more after several plays. But the mini expansion with new characters adds enough additional variety to keep this regularly returning to the table on many occasions - I have notched up 30 plays in total. There is a lot of game here compressed into a moderate playing time. Marco Polo is most challenging as a 4-player game, but as a 3-player it has the benefit of being quicker still, and it even makes a surprisingly good 2-player game.

I said: "Excellent worker placement game.  Love the character super powers - wish there were more."
After a few plays I'm really disappointed that for a game that says "Voyages of..." you really do not do much travel, it is just too expensive.  Even with super powers that promote travel it is very difficult.  Most of your points will come from fulfilling contracts.
Still a good worker placement.

Given my gaming taste, reading about this game it should be one of those games I really like, Played twice, first time face-to-face, next on-line, but in both games I was stymied by continual unlucky die-rolls and there is nothing I could  do when that happens continually.

A mish-mash of mechanisms and poorly designed to balance piss-poor luck with the dice makes this a game (?) that I will certainly never play again; and that level of disquiet with a game is normally reserved for war games and those "dripping with theme" but forgot about the fun of the game play. 

With its absurdly high rating, this is another game which proves that some people can be fooled all of the time, even those whose gaming tastes are similar to mine.

This was a nice game but I never felt like I was in control of my destiny. I don't necessarily feel like the randomness was too much, I think that was sufficiently mitigatable, but I did feel like between the location goals and the guy you get you're pretty heavily directed in certain ways. Because of this most of the game felt to me like optimizing the single turn, I very rarely was thinking even one turn ahead. It felt very much like I was on rails. Not an unpleasant experience and certainly not something I'd avoid but I'm not planning on going looking for it either. But there is some fun in using your player power and the special actions on the travel areas.

Interesting exchange-combination-of-goods-for-VPs system mixed with a move and establish control (non-exclusive) of areas of production, and worker placement.  With dice.  The theme does work for me but it is not so tightly meshed with the game that they are inseparable.  I think a common mistake is to think that Traveling is one way to win, with fulfilling Contracts as another.  Rather Traveling should be seen as a mean to get ways to achieve VPs, the same as fulfilling Contracts - it is just that most of the characters in the game would find the latter an easier method to concentrate on.

The special roles seem really powerful, but I guess it's balanced if everyone has one. I got the role that didn't have to roll dice, so it felt a little bit like I was playing a different game. Other than that, it's a typical euro, lots of stuff going on. Hard to draw any firm conclusions because of the role of the initial setup. Would need more play to sort that out. Update: got the role that gets a free white die and a free contract every turn. Interesting to see the differentness and the sameness.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (August 2015)

Good Euro game. I wasn’t expecting anything from it but I really enjoyed it. The rules aren’t complex and the playtime can be under 90 minutes with fast players. Still it has lots of interesting/deep decisions (basically where to play your dice, but there are many options to do this). The game is very tight as you only have 5 rounds so it has a feel of “too much to do with too few resources”, money is very scarce (and traveling is very expensive). 

It has some luck, but I think it can be mitigated (rerolls, low dice are very useful, if the sum of the dice is 15 or less you can get money/camels) so it doesn’t bother me. There is a higher luck factor with the goal cards but I don’t think they are a deal breaker. The replayability seems to be very high, a huge plus in my book. 

The art is beautiful and the game components are very well done.

I don’t like nor dislike the theme.

On the bad side, some characters seem much more powerful than others. In particular the one that let you travel through oasis practically guarantees that you will get first to Beijing AND you will be able to accomplish all your goal cards. The other one I felt was overly powerful is the one that lets you play your dice without paying any money. To conclude, I feel the characters are unbalanced but I’m not really sure. I need to play more to really see. 
 
Bottom line, The Voyages of Marco Polo is one of the best dice placement games I have played, it offers lots of strategy and I love that. I want to play it soon again. A keeper in my game collection.

After more plays, I still can find a noticeable unbalance in the characters and I’m very glad :D. They seem unbalanced but they aren’t. 

The variable (advanced) setup add lots of replayability. Very good stuff.

For now I’m enjoying the game tremendously so I’m upgrading its rating. I will never turn down a game of Marco Polo, very good game.

- Really enjoy this game.
- Looks great on the table. Haven't played with 2, but plays really well with 3-4.
- I really enjoy the puzzle of making the most out of the roll while also trying to build an engine, achieve goals, fulfill contracts, and block/avoid being blocked by opponents.
- The very different, and very powerful player powers make this a cool game as everyone is jealous of everyone else's abilities.
- The dice-roll randomness can be frustrating, especially as there isn't too much you can do about it that isn't prohibitively expensive.
- There's also a bit of randomness in the dealing of the goals that can be a little bit frustrating in that some combinations are harder/easier to achieve than others. This is somewhat balanced by the points awarded, but in combination with the player powers, it can definitely appear that one player has an advantage/disadvantage over others.
- However, it looks like the soon to be released expansion will help rectify/balance some of these issues.

I really dig this game.  I can see why it has so much hype around it.  The dice placement is fun.  I like the adding of action options with travel and the fact that you don't get blocked from necessary actions but it does cost you to use them after another player.  There seems to be a pretty big disparity in usefulness between the different characters, but at least you get some options to choose from to start the game.  Overall, I think it is well balanced.

RATING: 7
A solid dice-placement euro whose unique feature is giving everyone a different rule-breaking "super power" that pretty much allows them to ignore one or more of the games core rules when playing. The actions involve collecting resources in order to fulfill contracts or to travel to destinations on the board, which open up additional actions for the players that reach them. While points are acquired throughout the game through contracts, end game scoring involves reaching destination cities on two goal cards handed out at the game's beginning.

Besides the rule-breaking characters, there isn't a ton of innovative stuff in the game. It is, however, solidly designed and pleasant to play. I'm not sure if the interest in this will last more than a few plays, but we'll see. I'll enjoy it for now and my fiance liked it as well, which is a plus.

Although I had my expectations high, The Voyages of Marco Polo did not disappoint. 

The game has been sitting on my shelf for a while, but I decided that I would not teach myself the rules.  Invariably I make monumental rules mistakes that I don't catch for several games.  There is a lot going on in Marco Polo, so I would have certainly made some rules blunders.  I finally came across someone who could teach me the game and we played two players.

In Marco Polo, there are many good choices, but if your opponent selects something you had hoped to do, suddenly it becomes a little more expensive. With only six turns in a game, you are forced to accomplish a lot in a short period of time, so you must be judicious with your choices. 

As you secure trading posts, you give yourself more options for die placement. If you can secure the right cities, you maybe able to create an engine that not only rewards you with victory points and goods.

There are a few potential pitfalls.  At the begining of the game is character selection.  Each character has special abilities and not all the characters are equally good. Frankly, a few of the characters are just plan bad.  Maybe the bad characters could be used as a balancing mechanism, when playing with new players.

The only other potential concern is the player count. The game is very snappy at two players. I would not have any worries with three players, but at four players, I am afraid the game may drag on a bit.  Also, one of the characters seems to be overly strong at the higher player counts - it mitigates the additional cost of entering a blocked space.

Looking forward to future plays.  I anticipate my rating to increase over time.players take the better characters and experienced players select the relatively bad characters.

Bit of love/hate with this one.  It uses dice in a similar manner as Bora Bora - you play your own dice as workers.  High dice are more powerful.  However, in Bora Bora, the advantage of low dice is that they are easier to play.  Here, every player after the first in a given area simply pays the value of the dice.  It's a bit of all-or-nothing.  Not as clever tactically as Bora Bora.  

I sometimes feel that the game is a bit of a grind.  You want to do more than you can, but rather than a delicious frustration and challenge, I find that the gears just grind down with turns that are not sufficiently productive.

I've played Marco Polo several times and while I think the game is excellent it just doesn't grab me. I have no explanation. I'm happy to play if someone suggests it, but I would seldom suggest it myself.

[b]Constraints:[/b]
The game does an excellent job of squeezing you in every direction. There are never enough actions to accomplish everything and money is extremely tight. The area in which I really feel squeezed is movement. Planning and executing movement is very though, and if you want to make your routes you are going to have to plan things carefully from the first turn. Superb and challenging!

[b]Dice:[/b]
While the dice occasionally hinder you, it's usually just an interesting puzzle to work out. I would lump this with [thing=84876]The Castles of Burgundy[/thing]. Both games feature dice prominently and both more-or-less remove the ability to be completely screwed by them.

[b]Asymmetry:[/b]
The character you get in the game will have a huge impact on your play and strategy. This provides a lot of variability between games and tweaks how you play each time. They seem very well balanced and meaningfully different, which is quite an accomplishment.

On the asset side Marco Polo has a nearly unlimited setup variability and strategic gameplay. At initial setup, players have to form a plan what benefits to exploit for points and hopefully realize it without too much competition. The main drawback is the dependability on good die rolls. Most of the time, higher dice are simply better. One or maybe two lower dice are ok. On average, the rolls should even out but the problem is that at a few key points the wrong roll will lose lots of points and can decide the game.

As usual for games of this pedigree, the theme is very boring, completely pasted on and, at this point, detrimental to my enjoyment of the game. However, the strength of the special powers is the key to what makes the game fun. Each power seems completely dominating until you see them all in action. It is interesting to see how they balance each other out. Still, the luck of the dice rolls can make a huge difference and could definitely be an annoyance for some. It will be interesting to see how this one plays out with more experience. 7 for now.

A dice worker placement game, perhaps most similar to Alien Frontiers. If it wasn't for the convoluted systems in play (i.e. if the game was simpler) I would enjoy it more. There are just too many little rules that don't suit a random game like this one.

Excellent game with multiple path to victory.  Plays very quickly as well with 2 to 4 players.  The player power all seems to be over powered.  Learning how to maximize your action die is the key to victory along with using your player power to your advantage. One of my top 10 games of all time.

I don't understand why the industry standard for Euro's is to be "super tight".  This is a great system, destroyed by the short length and super restrictive play. The game has 5 rounds, and you will make 3-5 "moves" per round. So it's tight because it's incredibly short and you have a super limited number of moves. The gameplay is fun, but we found it just as irritating as games like Agricola. We like Euro's such as Viticulture+Tuscany, where yeah, I can't do "all the things I want to do", but I sure can do A LOT of them! I will say we loved the modular board, but I didn't enjoy the strict dice placement (it can get very expensive and the "lowest die determines what you get" is just retarded).

RATING: 8
Tight worker placement game that doesn't necessarily bring much new to the table, but does everything very well. Filling two kinds of tickets and expensive board movement combined with trying to get the best out of your dice with roughly twenty actions throughout the game is an intriguing combination. Replayability is guaranteed with randomized city bonuses and characters.

RATING: 7
Love the power level of the character cards, without which this game would be rather bland. Like the movement/logistics aspect, which is underdone in Euros. The rest is rather overdone however. Will also never play with 4 again: 3 is tight enough.

Very fun dice placement game.

Two best parts of the game? The travelling that allow you to leave your mark on the board + customize your options AND the very diverse player powers.

Fast paced. So much so that I prefer playing with four to get just that little bit more time to calculate my moves... ;)

RATING: 8
Seems unbalanced at first, but it's not as much to matter.

The game mechanisms are really interesting, utilizing dice as worker placement.
Even though the dice rolls matter the game gives value to small value dice as well as big ones, so the numbers you roll are not hugely important.
A reroll mechanism exist as well that helps a lot.

My only issue with the game is that it finishes really abruptly. You are still trying to figure out how to do some stuff and puff the game is finished.
That's sometimes good and sometimes bad.

Overall a great game!

This is a really tight worker placement game with tough decisions to make every single turn. All the special abilities are overpowered and that is the point. You really feel unique and powerful with every character and need to find ways to manipulate your power. Secret objectives give a sense of direction but choosing fitting contracts is even more important. After 5 turns you are left with contracts you completed, cities you visited and a journey you had. Another thing I like is that low numbers are valuable as high numbers and sometimes you are desperate for low numbers because you don't have the money to pay for a higher roll. A beautiful game that plays so smoothly.

2016-08-13 - 7.5 - It's really good and I know that I played really inefficiently last time, so there is quite a bit to learn how to play it. I really like variable player powers in games. Because of them and because of variety of city cards this game should offer decent replayability.

2016-08-16 - 7.5->8 - We played again and I made sure, that I really enjoy this game. It is lighter than Tzolk'in but not as much as I thought, which isn't bad or good thing, just worth mentioning.

2018-01-26 - The big expansion is pretty good. It opens up the game, giving you more possibilities, especially for travel. It works really good with 5 players. With 3 I would not use the Venice module. If you really enjoy the game I would reccomend getting the expansion.

RATING: 9
I really enjoy the blend of mechanics in this game, the dice placement, route building and the unique player powers make for crucial decisions every turn. The 80 minute play time for 4 players is accurate and the game has a great pace and doesn't overstay its welcome. The dice rarely screw you over because high and low dice values are equally desirable, the dice rolls lend a tactical element to each turn because you have to find the most effective actions for the dice you've rolled.

The variability of the big city action spaces and the route cards keep the game fresh, let alone how the player abilities completely change how each game feels. The traveling around the map is tough but it's satisfying when you make clever combinations with the city action spaces and complete a bunch of contracts or travel multiple times in a turn.

Each dice action, each camel and every bit of money matters, the game is very tight. I've taught the game many times now and the first play usually people will stick to contracts and won't complete very much because they often spend many dice on getting gold or silk. Once people get experienced there are a few things that make be game easier to complete many contracts and traveling a lot at the same time.

One thing is the rewards that each contract gives, more often than not picking the right sequence of contracts can let you 'chain' them together, where one contract reward lets you complete the next one easier. Or if traveling is your primary goal then choose the contracts that give you camels, extra travel or money as rewards.

The biggest element to pay attention to in my opinion is before you actually start playing the game. The first things that are set up are the big city action cards, bonus tiles and the small city round bonus tiles. These are hugely important and should determine which route cards you choose. For example if you see that there are many big city action cards that provide camels then you'll know traveling the top two paths will be easier, if you see that there are not many money spaces available then you know to avoid the bottom route (the one with the expensive ferry routes).

I had assumed I would like it based on the previews I read but it exceeded my expectations. The designer duo had previously brought out Tzolk'in which is another one of my favourites. Luciani was also behind Grand Austria Hotel another acclaimed Euro from 2015. Really looking forward to what this duo comes out with next!

The Voyages of Marco Polo has quickly become one of my favourite games and definitely my favourite game of 2015. If you like tight euro-style games that require an equal amount of strategic planning and tactical play then I can't recommend this game enough.

A fairly straight forward game in that there are only so many actions you can do, certainly at the start of the game however the challenge comes from working out the most efficient actions that work towards your goal. Whilst other players can't block the main actions, following them incurs a tax based upon the die you use.

The various characters and player abilities should give this game a lot of replay ability and makes me want to play it again with other characters, In this game there doesn't appear to be such a thing as a bad roll as both high and low numbers have their advantages.

The roles force you how to play. This is even worse than it sounds.

Different roles means different unbalances in the game. 
It would be a good game if the unbalances were marginal. 

No desire to own this

edit: so the game in itself is an enjoyable exchange of resources for VP. However the roles determine most of your plays and in doing so leaves you with only a few options in each game.
The theme is sort of present on the hameboard but not in the gameplay. They might have called it VP ,arket.

Some Ticket to Ride mixed with Stone Age, with the dice placement thrown in. Quite fresh implementation of the dice-as-workers, different from games like Alien Frontiers or Troyes. The location cards and variable powers add a good deal of replayability. The random stuff seems to be well balanced. The character you get dictates the strategy somewhat, so once you've played a couple times and know what to avoid trying, it becomes a nice, quick and quite light fare.

Excellent euro game with decent amount of player interaction. Each player character has special powers which are going to dictate individual strategies. These powers may seem unbalanced at first but in the end it seems to be quite balanced. I really like how the game feels and looks like. It doesn't drag on too long.
There is some luck involved with rolling the dice (not with Rashid though) but I personally don't mind a little luck in games. Understanding the rules is probably not going to be very easy for some players.

Has the same problem than many other a bit heavier games published lately: takes some time to teach it although the game itself is easy to get-into-it. Different kind of characters makes things interesting and you've to modify your gameplay when played with different characters .There are enough competition between players and room to some blocking moves as well. BUT after three games played this feels more like a work than actually fun to play. That's because you need to have long-time plan and try to accomplish it, then remember your plan  - and because there are quite a lot things to calculate - even a one small error and you can ruin the whole game. So I didn't have that fun time to play it, which why it deserves to go to the better home. Not my cup of tea, there are more interesting games out there.

As far as complex pure Eurogames go, it's a really nice one with interesting combinations, a functional map (always a big plus for me) and very strong character abilities that might put you on a strategic path from the beginning, but it just adds to the fun of the game this time, I think. I liked it more than I expected from the designers of Tzolk'in (which I was not a fan of). Probably rolling those dice also helped.

RATING: 7
Sold after nine plays. Still a good game but it isn't one I find myself asking to play or get to the table. While there are different routes to pursue depending on the character and the variable map setup, it still feels samey. Perhaps I'm just getting a bit jaded, who knows?

Repeat plays have been quite interesting and enjoyable. Works well with two players. Feels like it basically comes down to a fight between whomever uses their overpowered character most efficiently in respect to reading and using the board's setup as to who will win.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

I enjoyed my first play quite a bit and we jumped right into the advanced game. Didn't realize initially how difficult movement can be on the board. In the character draft, I am thinking that you want to make sure to focus your strategy around your character as much as possible since they all "break the rules" in some fashion. Some feel more powerful than others, but each are powerful in their own way if used well. The dice manipulation and use is quite interesting and quite frustrating at times as you cannot do everything you want to do most times. The small town and large city bonuses and special actions are quite interesting and the city actions will vary quite a bit from game to game as you only use 9 of 30 cards in a game. There's quite a bit to suss out in this game as you figure out the best plan of attack for you. Most spots can be occupied by everyone but after the first person places dice, players are paying gold equal to the lowest die placed on top of another player.

RATING: 8
+ Very nice components, perfectly designed for usability.
+ Relatively inexpensive. 
+ Streamlined rules. Almost everything is on the board (except for the rules on stacking dice, which are important but simple enough).
+ Nice player aids. 
+ All the powers are attractive. 
+ Each game should be different thanks to the initial random placement of bonuses (to be checked with more than one game).
+ Individual player powers add to the variety. 
+ Nice tension created by the goals. 
+ Works well enough with two, even though I guess that more players bring more constraints, which is probably nice (not tried yet). 
+ The goals of each player are very clear (face up contracts), which makes strategizing around this possible (through blocking actions, etc.).
+ The race element keeps the tension high enough (real-time scoring, with a race for the city bonuses).
+ Fast turns.
- This is only another Euro, albeit an extremely well crafted one. 
$ Not as deep as Agricola (because Agricola has a rich set of cards)—but with a larger "mechanical" variety thanks to the random distribution of powers on the map: sometimes it will be easier to travel thanks to easily accessible recurring camel bonuses, sometimes not, etc.).

RATING: 5
Like talking to a scientist at a party where everyone just wants have fun. If only she'd let her hair down and open up a bit. There's a fun game in here but it refuses to let itself out. 

The game is way too tight and over just as it starts to get going. Moving as a strategy is too expensive for most characters and the value of moving is not huge even if you do it. The benefits moving unlocks are minimal, by the time you unlock them the game is almost over and often the most useful benefits don't even appear due to the random setup.

The superb production quality and the mechanics make the game seem interesting but you soon realise that the game winner will generally be the one who rolls the highest numbers.

Remove the costs of movement on the board, add large bonuses to every city regardless of size, make the bonuses more useful, make moving through a city enough to place a market or add more movement paths and possibly add a couple of extra rounds and you might have a game worth playing.

Still a nice and interesting game.

What's Great: 
Excellent feeling of balance with all of the bonus actions to compensate for bad dice rolls. Numerous strategies, various characters and cards which add to its replayability. Overall just a great gaming experience and simplistic enough to teach to both casual and competitive players. 

Even if you feel like you're losing, you can come back from behind by fulfilling goals and placing all of your trading posts.

What's Not So Great: 
Out of print (at the time of review) so an affordable copy may be hard to find. Certain actions may feel redundant in certain play throughs especially if people are playing very nicely.

Heavy, thinky, worker placement. The first game I really hunted down to find a copy. Variable player powers really make the game. That combined with the big variety in board set up means this game has tons of replay and tons of variety in play.

All players get a character with a special bonus. This bonus drives how you accumulate your points in the wide variety offered. Everyone will have crossover, creating conflicts and the tension from the requirement to time your choices well. However, in my relatively young experience, this seems that it will always been a game of inches. While I like balance and close finishes, I do not like a system that imposes that upon players; especially when some are more skilled and "should " do better than a newer player (no matter how naturally savvy at board games).

It's solid, but we will see if my enthusiasm rises.

Eigenlijk heel eenvoudige maar leuke mechanismen. Niet iedere rol is volgens mij even sterk en scoren met reizen hangt af van de plaatjes die bij de start op het bord worden gelegd. Maar sowieso... topspel!

I love the look of the game.  I love the various mechanics.   I love trying to figure out which of the 90 different things that I need to do is best at that moment.  I love the theme.  And I love that you are never blocked from an action as long as you have $$$ -- and cameeples!  Wasn't expecting to like the game play as much as I love the bits, but this really blew me away.

What i don't understood, why rashid was implemented as character. I mean it is a dice game an he can just put the numbers he wants.
This was boring, not unbalanced just boring.
Anyways, game themselves was boring.

RATING: 4
After 6 rounds our gameround of 4 players (sometimes guest players at the table) we could notice the following: mercator wins when played by experienced player. Just finish as much jobs/missions as you can, travel only for income. We definitely not understand why the travel routes are so complicated to finish your goal cards and why only to use a workerplace with your game color once per round. by fixing this two annoying game mechanics/designs this game could be so much better. Although the characters has te rebalance a bit, even the travel strong characters are noth strong enough to place all the trade posts on the map. so bad...

It seems the route prices have been chosen randomly. Some contracts seems umbalanced, and when you do contracts you can win even without voyaging. I traded away because I think it would have been great if only more balanced in route costs and contracts.

Sympathique à l'explication des règles, mais relativement ennuyeux à jouer (même si la mécanique tourne bien) : toujours la même rengaine de récolte/transformation de ressource, placement/déplacement déjà vu et revu (le fait d'avoir des éléments tirés aléatoirement en début de partie pour avoir des plateaux "toujours différents" ne change pas un jeu déjà vu en super jeu de la mort qui tue).
Bref, ça commence à saouler sérieusement tous ces jeux qui se ressemblent.

RATING: 7
I am a little worried by the relative strength of contracts vs travelling: focusing the former seems superior, but that strategy is not very fun. 

Very tactical in timing your dice placement. Good variety from different characters.

RATING: 6
Two plays of this game.  My initial play was very negative, where I did not understand that the game is an order fulfillment game.  You need to work on orders and if you don't, you will lose.  Overall, it was not a bad game, and I do like the special roles at the beginning of the game, but I find the resources very tight and it is hard to really generate enough resources to push through the orders.  

I like the game but don't know if I would ever request it.  I give it a 6 right now, but maybe with more plays it will go up.

I like that although there's a lot of randomness in [b][thing=171623][/thing][/b], most of it is in the set up and once set up, the only other bit is the die and how the contracts come out. And the randomness of both is mitigated by, for the dice, using camels to re-roll or modify them, and for the contracts, by there being six available each turn. It's very rare that all the available contracts are unappealing.  The random board layout makes each game feel just a bit different. Some games money is plentiful and other times it's very tight. Some games, travel is easy as there are locations and contracts that give movement points aplenty, and some games there aren't. In other games, VPs can be made in cities, and other games, VPs are primarily from contracts. Which means each play there's a different optimum strategy (which may or may not have to be flexible given what other players are doing).

RATING: 7
Very good traditional euro. More control than Kingsburg, and more thematic than Castles of Burgandy, makes this my preferred euro dice game.
The only downside being that it's too long and somewhat prone to AP, esp in the endgame.
Edited on 17/8/2015: On further thinking I believe this game offers nothing new, but is a perfect mix of Castles of Burgundy, Elfenland, some strange worker placement and maybe a bit of Terra Mystica. The theme is very thin, but the colourful board, super functional design and multiple paths of victory all make this game enjoyable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
An interesting midweight dice-placement euro that doesn't take too long. The fun part was the individual player powers. As my friend who taught us explained, all the abilities are so powerful they're broken, but since everybody's are like that they even out. There's a map and traveling gives you good bonuses, but it's just impossible to travel very far without giving up points, which doesn't really sit well with me in a game called The Voyages of Marco Polo.

Probably the best game I have played in the last year. Even the games I came last in were enjoyable. A friend is attempting to play Orleans at least 50 times this year. I would be more than happy to do the same with this.

RATING: 8.4
Great worker placement/point salad game with map. What seems to set up this game in another class is the variable player power via the 8 cool characters. With few games played, i think they are well balance.

Variable city effects ensure not 2 games are the same.

Cannot find  single lack in this game. I've only played 2p games and neverthless it provides great fun, probably the best game I've tried so far.
Great artwork, great components, clear and simple rules, useful player aid, smooth and fast gameplay, great interaction and a good amount of planning is required.
Quite simple to play but very gratifying if you do it well. 
A perfect mix of good ideas actualized in a great production.

This is one of those games where once you start explaining the rules to new players who aren't aware of the rules- they will be like---ah ok like Castles, oh...ok, like worker placement, oh...ok like Ticket to Ride...ah...like that...everything is so familiar, but at the same time how it all comes together is refreshing giving such a great gameplay.Just doubt how it plays with 2, but definitely with 3-4 it rocks.

Dice-worker-placement at its best. The several unique characters are amazing and change you strategy and tactics a lot. The components are top noch. The game flow feels good and smooth; sometimes you have to wait a bit, especially in a 4 player game. But sometimes you do a very interconnected and long turn by your self :) it is fun!

A great worker placement game. Your workers are dice and you score points by moving around the board and managing resources. Actions can be repeated through a "tax" system. Unique, extremely powerful character abilities and the initial layout of the board is random but will not change. Plays up to 4 in about 90 minutes

[b]New Characters[/b]

I'm a little concerned that contracts are the heart of a game that looks like it really wants you to travel. I did win a game yesterday even though my opponent had scored more contracts so it might be fine. Variable setup and player abilities give it massive replayability and the action cards in cities are probably more important than they seem, especially the point and money generating actions. Only played 2-player so far and it's definitely enjoyable but heightened interaction with more players might turn the game into what I really want it to be.

Update 11/28/15: I'm less concerned about the contract problem. The new characters expansion adds a lot for such a small package.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Typical euro where you have to convert resources in points. Nothing new and the board is not very inviting. Not one second I was thinking about the theme while playing this game. 
Lots of rules but the game plays rather smooth since your options are always limited by the position where you are and your amount of money.

Good game but one that can be easily forgotten. When you are new to gaming and enjoy medium to heavy weight euro's, you'll probably be very enthousiastic about this game. 

Minus: 2 - 4 - 5 - 6 - 9

RATING: 8
Regrettably, I’ve only played a single game of this so far, but that certainly whetted my appetite. While your character will certainly pull you towards a certain strategy, there are more than enough decisions left in how best to implement this. The fact that each of these characters seems to appear overpowered to somebody speaks towards an overall good balance, and replayability should be through the roof due to the variant setup.

My only (small) worry is a potential lack of interaction – in our one game, one player made a costly move  to thwart the strategy of another, which did not work out well for him. Generally, though, the boons you gain as the first merchant to reach a city should make such moves palatable, and there is a good deal of possible blocking moves in the action spaces. So on the whole, I’d say this is another winner from Hans im Glück, and might be one of the few games I’m going to buy in 2015.

So far, it has replaced Troyes, Macao, & The Castles of Burgundy for me.  If I'm going to play a mid-weight dice euro, this is it.  Reminds me a bit of Terra Mystica mixed with Hansa Teutonica...definitely not a bad thing!

Updated 10/17/16:  Played it 13 times (and several more times on yucata.de) before I got rid of my copy.  Would still gladly play someone else's copy, but this wasn't a keeper for me.  Started to feel a bit samey and not quite deep enough to entice me to play this many more times.  Still think it is more enjoyable than the 3 games it replaced for me above.  However, Grand Austria Hotel has replaced Marco Polo for me.

I had wanted this for a long time. I guess I haven't played it enough to have any definite opinion on it. I enjoyed the plays and want to try it again with different characters. The dice placement is great and I like the idea of every action being open to you at least once a round as long as you are willing to pay for it.

In my short experience of the game, 2 plays, it does seem extremely well balanced, when initially you would presuppose (with so many variables and asymmetric characters) possibly it wouldn't be. Travelling is not necessary to win, despite the word voyages in the title, but what you do do, you have to plan well and be efficient.

The game is over all to quickly and in no way outstayed it's welcome, this is a big positive for me and I look forward to playing it more in the future.

I don't have the extra characters (yet), how many games did you play before you wanted to add them in?

Good game that could prove to be great with more plays.

My first 10 on BGG. An excellent game with an outstanding replay value. Multiple paths can lead to very high scores and it's only after 10 or so plays that you will understand this game's potential.
Don't judge it based solely on your first play because the intricacies of this "chef d'oeuvre" will become clearer as you'll have more plays on your shoulders.
This is definitely a must have.

I had very high expectations for this game! It was a MUST HAVE, based on my affinity for dice placement games and the general look of the game. I was not disappointed. Don't be fooled--there is a lot going on in this game. If you don't pay attention to everything, you might get creamed! Being that the game is titled: "The Voygaes of Marco Polo," you should fully expect that traveling is essential in this game. In fact, you shouldn't see your dice placement options as varying paths to victory; you should see these options as opportunities to collect the necessary resources and materials to make your journey successful. It reminded me of Village a bit. Their central mechanisms are quite different, but in both games traveling is extremely powerful. In Village though, traveling is one of several options. In this game, traveling is the end goal, and everything else is the means to get you there. 

The components are quite nice in this game. I love the resource bits and the little camels. Even the meeples and trading posts are nicely produced--so much better than simple cubes. The art is beautiful. The graphic design is nice and clear, however, because the board is so busy, it's difficult to see everything that's going on during the game. 

The theme is expressed by the components and art. The special ability tiles also help. However, on a thematic immersion scale, I'd give this game a 4 out of 10. To be fair, it might feel more thematic as you get more comfortable with the game mechanics and options. 

I'm very happy to own this game. I love it! My initial rating is only tentative, and I fully expect it to go up with future plays.

Bought at cardhaus.

Simple gameplay and dice placement mechanisms, but a lot of strategy.  Each character feels vastly overpowered (esp. Rashid), but it's still somehow balanced.  This creates a sense of asymmetric gameplay.  Combined with the variable setup and differing city powers, there's A LOT of replayability.

There's a lot of good variability in win conditions as well.  Although each character power suggests one specific course, there are a lot of options available: fulfilling contracts, travel bonuses, taking advantage of city actions, etc.

Ein tolles Spiel aus der Feder von Simone Luciani und Daniele Tascini, das den Spieler auf die Reisen von Marco Polo mitnimmt. In Grundzügen Worker-Placement, das aber zusätzlich noch auf Würfel zurück greift. Hierüber kommt der Glücksfaktor noch mehr zum Tragen. Durch die verschiedenen Charaktere muss man auch jeweils ganz individuelle Strategien fahren. 
Die grafische Darstellung von Dennis Lohausen ist wie immer wunderschön anzusehen und integriert die Workerplacement-Felder schön in den Spielplan.
Insgesamt ein wunderbares Spiel, das immer wieder gern auf den Tisch kommt!

"New characters" promo welcomed for experienced players and replayability. "Agents of Venice" provides even more replayabilty, a fifth player and more opportunities to use powerful combinations of cities cards, towns bonuses and character and companions powers, which is always positive for me. Even then, base game is great and neither expansions are really "must have".

An exquisite worker placement/action selection hybrid with variable player powers, a relatively short play time, and deep strategy.

Tiene buenas ideas y me gustaría volver a jugarlo para intentar lo que me vende el juego: viajar. En la primera partida me pareció que viajar era demasiado costoso y me dediqué a hacer contratos. Haciendo solo dos veces la acción de viajar gané la partida. Me dio la sensación de que había mucho mapa pero desaprovechado ya que los otros jugadores tampoco viajaron demasiado y muchas ciudades se quedaron totalmente vacías.

Si lo vuelvo a jugar intentaré hacer más la acción de viajar y ver si los dos dados, más la pasta, más posiblemente camellos o más pasta merecen la pena por los beneficios que aportan las ciudades. Porque para mí de momento el juego se llama Los contratos de Marco Polo o, mejor todavía, Los tejemanejes de Marco Polo.

Excellent dice placement game, probably my second favorite after Troyes.  I really like the random setup, variety of asymmetric characters, and costs for stacking dice on previously used spaces.

(Note to self - Small city bonuses are received immediately upon initial hut placement and at the beginning of each subsequent round! Previously we only gave the bonus at the beginning of each round.)

A good "combo" game with dices (but values of dices are not a real concern thanks to a compensation mechanism). Every players pick a character at the begining of the game, with unique powerfull habilities, and players have to combine their travel objectives and delivery strategy with these powers in order to gain Victory Points.
Very good game.

After your first game: "Impossible! How can you expect me to do so much with so few turns?!" 

After your third game: "Wait a minute..."

After your fifth game: "Hey I'm getting the hang of this!"

Then you meet a really experienced player and it all starts again! 

So much set-up variety and unique characters that each break some fundamental rule of the game. Great game!

I have a kind of hate-love relationship with Marco Polo.
On the one hand, nice theme, deep euro with innovative dice usage, replayability and so on, great game.
On the other hand it gives me too much to ponder about, with no tolerance for miscalculation. So beeing one coin too short can easily be frustrating, just as if a player took the action you wanted first.

Update after three plays: not sure about the balance in this game. Perhaps the characters differ too much. No matter who is playing them, some will always win in any set up, is my experience so far. Downgraded for now, I will explore the game further.

Very solid game of known mechanisms. Workerplacement (dice placement), travel, fulfillment of goals, special roles and points to be grabbed in various places around the board. Not as innovative as Tzolkin by the same designers, but certainly an interesting and good game that I want to explore further. The players' roles differ a lot and make you focus on a different playing style. The set-up is different each time, which also guarantees plenty of replayability.

A wonderful masterpiece. 

Marco Polo succeeds in combining mechanisms that I very much enjoy, into a game that once finished I want to play again. And again and again. Every character makes you look at the game from an different angle, and thusly make the game a different experience every time.

I prefer playing with the drafting variant, but there's nothing wrong with the beginner mode either.

This game is a lot of fun. I really enjoy the tension that builds when the board begins to fill up with the other players' dice. I enjoy the various strategies available within the game as well.

An outstanding mix of mechanisms allows each player to be doing their own thing and playing their own game, while simultaneously interacting with the other players. Each character plays uniquely to give the game more variety and also discourages all players from using the same strategy. Lots of randomization in setup and players having secret scoring goals gives the game more replayability.

Game ổn từ đầu tới cuối, không có gì quá đặc biệt cũng không có gì dở.

Điểm cộng của game là khả năng chơi lại cực kỳ cao, mỗi lần chơi game này sẽ là một trải nghiệm hoàn toàn khác. Vì với mỗi game việc set up các action có thể làm được trong game là khác nhau hoàn toàn và mỗi nhân vật trong game có một skill riêng, mà phải nói là skill rất mạnh và định hình chiến thuật cho nhân vật đó. Nên nói mỗi khi chơi game này là chơi một game khác hẳn so với ván trước cũng ko sai. Vậy nên chiến thuật trong game này không sâu mà là dàn trải ra rất nhiều thể loại.

Game có độ khó trung bình, không burn não. Việc quản lý dice để làm action khá thú vị. Khả năng bóp của game là cao, vì những action mạnh cũng như thiên về kiếm điểm đều nằm trong large city, mỗi lượt chỉ có 1 người được dùng. Cũng như các action kia khi người ta đi trước rồi thì mình khá thọt khi phải trả thêm tiền để đi tương ứng với xí ngầu mình dùng. Nên đến vòng cuối khi cần vét những điểm cuối cùng và nhiều khi là cần vét cú chót một số lượng điểm lớn thì rất dễ bị bóp chẹt bởi những người chơi khác.

Điểm trừ của game là thematic yếu, nói trắng ra chỉ là một đám lái buôn với super power đi phát triển mạng lưới trading port và buôn bán kiếm tiền trên con đường tơ lụa. Game scale không được tốt lắm, chơi với 2p thì game cũng chỉ hay ở mức 8đ, còn với 3-4 ng thì game có thể lên đến 9đ nếu may mắn trong việc setup ngẫu nhiên.

A fantastic dice placement game where every player has fantastic near game breaking ability, anything from taking goods when other players purchase something from the market to not paying penalties when placing on occupied spaces to choosing your dice result when placing one, and so forth.

In the game you try to gather goods and money in order to travel (to set up trading posts and hopefully visit as many of the cities depicted on your scoring card) and fulfill contracts (to earn points). After a given amount of rounds the player with the most points wins the game.

It's highly enjoyable, especially because of the really good player powers that are in the game. It's often really hard to decide as you kinda just want all of them.

Highly recommended, it's a complete blast to play.

Very good dice placement game with nice mechanics. So different player roles and a variable setup allow you to play in so different way. This make the game really challenging to play. The replayability is then extremely high. It has good depth and magnificent artwork. 

Not so feldian for me - luckly, even if there's possibility to make a lot of combo. But it's definitely not point salad game. 

Really good with 2p, best with 3. Ok with 4p.

Interessantes Spiel mit vielen fein ineinander greifenden Mechanismen. Funktioniert auf den ersten Eindruck ganz gut.

So, this is where gaming has gone, has it?  An overgraphics map, some variable powers, lots of ways to score, getting colored wood to turn into othe colored wood, an absent theme... Have seen this so many times before.  The game works fine, but it feels like all the others.  Yes, this one uses dice (I got the feel of Troyes out of it) but that didn't make it feel much different.  The Marco Polo theme was pretty lame, as you can travel like one city and still have a chance to win.  Silly.

I have a good time playing this despite the fact that contracts are OP. I think I need to house rule a couple things. Traveling takes way too many dice over too few turns and the end reward is just not there. The game offers up the idea that you're going to play the variable 30+ city action spaces but you really don't get much of an opportunity to. Game deserves a few more plays... perhaps I'm off.

Dice-driven worker placement that inn many ways is a puzzle because you're trying to maximize what you can do given your dice, the routes open on the board, actions open, character powers, contracts, etc. Of course your opponents will often mess with your plans. You can travel around the map opening up new actions and gaining goods but it will cost you camels (to cross the dessert) or coins (to cross water) not to mention the cost just to hire a caravan. Instead, you may try to concentrate on just collecting goods to fulfill contracts, or you can try to do a bit of both. One can also purchase dice, change die values, etc. There's really a lot to think about and the designers have combined some concepts we're all familiar with in interesting ways.

Just don't care for the game. Too boring, too repetitive. Because there is just so much randomness. Which "super-powered" character do you get? Which city connection cards do you draw?

Először is: a doboz tele van anyaggal, így aki a két perces setupokat szereti, ezt felejtse is el. Cserébe viszont a játék legtöbb eleme random, egyedül a térképet kellett volna még modulárisan megoldani és egyből megszületett volna a (majdnem) tökéletes euró.

Másodszor: a játék nagyon jó, egyetleg negatívuma talán a térkép. Kevés és túlságosan szeparált az útvonal, ha már elindultál egy irányba, igen nehéz korrigálni (ez főként azokat érinti, akik a célkártyákra mennek).

Harmadszor: nem vészesen hosszú, pont ideális, de talán az 5 körös kicsit túlzás, lehetett volna 6-7 is.

Negyedszer: elsőre nagyon tetszett, ráadásul lisszaboni emlék is (49,99 EUR-ba került egy lisszaboni eldugott társasjáték üzletben).

Kiváló euró, örülök, hogy a polcra került.

Enjoyable dice placement game.  You really have to play up your player power.  I don't believe you could ignore what it provides and hope to win.  Each one is so strong, that if you ignore yours, others will exploit their's and crush you.  I do find the contracts a bit frustrating at times, and movement is a right and true pain the rear, but I do like the variety of actions and the tightness of the game.

One of the best Euros in years. An enticing blend of route-making, dice utilization, asymmetric powers, and resource conversion. The replayability is exceptional. Each game presents a new puzzle and route-making challenge. Fantastic at all player counts and perfect for 2. I appreciate, too, that the game lasts only five rounds so you have to accomplish your goals in a limited time frame. You can't ask for a more comprehensive yet accessible game playing experience in an hour.

RATING: 8.9
And this one is a great great game... the thing that sets it apart from other dice placement games like Kingsburg, Alien Frontiers, etc is the insanely powerful game-breaking characters... they are so crazy powerful that all of them seem a bit broken and that makes the game balanced... makes the different strategies be approached in different ways...
In what game that you roll dice to be able to do actions and the value of the dice have a direct impact on your choices do you have a character that allows you to go the whole game without rolling a single die?!?! You can just say what the value of the die is when you place it! That's just MADNESS!! But it's also crazy fun!

The rest of the game is pretty straight forward with one difference for the normal dice/worker placement games because usually when a place is occupied no one else can use that spot... in this game there's only one place where you can get limited by the value of the dice already placed there, you have to place a die equal or higher than the previous die, in all other places you can place any die you want (or combination of dice) and do the action... the thing is that if you are not the first to do the action you'll have to pay to the bank the same amount of money has the value of the lowest die you are using to do that action.

Great great game wit lots of freedom and yet a lot of good decisions to be made and the crazy insane fun powers are just awesome! 

The game has an immense replay-ability because of the different Characters, there are 8 different ones in the game... there are a LOT of personal goal cards... there are a lot of cit cards that will be placed in the cities with a new place for players that reached that city to do the action... etc

No two games will be the same!

A near-perfect game. I can't put my finger on exactly what it is that I like about this game, but I never seem to get tired of playing it. On paper, it doesn't appear to do anything that several dozen other games don't already do, but it comes together in a way that keeps me wanting to play. I think it just comes down to how well it manages to balance all those elements (dice placement, resource conversion, contract fulfillment, etc), and it certainly doesn't hurt that it's all packaged together with great artwork and components.

RATING: 7.5
I've been enjoying this one a lot more than I expected. It is initially frustrating because the cost of movement is SO HIGH--it is very easy to get locked-in if you can't figure out how to snag camels and money. Also, the radically different starting characters seem pretty unbalanced: aren't Marco Polo and Berke Khan heavily favoured (free contract + free die / don't pay for already-taken actions))? Yet if you didn't have some kind of character power this game would be a real slog: I would not advise playing it without the characters.

But I like puzzles and this game is best approached as a puzzle: how do I get from A to B to C with the resources I have, and taking into account the possibility of other players reaching cities or grabbing placement spots before I can? The game has an interestingly disparate mechanism for worker placement--you can take most spots even if they are occupied, as long as you pay some money, but the city spots (which are the best ones) can only be used by one player, period.

Not sure how this one will hold up over the long run but for now let's give it an 8 [dropped to 7.5]. It plays quite briskly, unlike the monstrously slow Grand Austria Hotel by the same designers, though it will slow down a lot with AP-prone players given how much hangs on each decision.

UPDATE: I still rather like this one, even though it's very low interaction--aside from snagging contracts someone else wants or making them pay more for die placements, there is actually no interaction. That's OK in my view--sometimes games just use other players as a kind of constraint/extra obstacle. 

My main tip: don't get too greedy about the black dice--unless you genuinely need extra dice (for the gold spot, e.g.), you'll just end up buying extra camels to pay for them which isn't much of a deal. They can be handy for guaranteeing you move last, though--which makes you the starting player next round. -- Also, snag a few trading posts ASAP because the actions they offer are at so much better die-to-value ratios than the main board.

A typical euro game where you use resources to generate VPs via contract fulfilment. The travel part of the game works well and integrates with additional resource benefits.
Overall, the game just feels a little to complicated for its own good. There is a lot going on and it feels to me that it could have benefited from some streamlining to make the game play quicker.

Very good, solid, dice worker placement Euro game.  As others have stated, I don't know that it brings anything new to the table, but everything does work quite well together, like a well oiled machine.  Although, the way you need multiple dice in some areas, and can still use your dice where other dice already exist by paying for that privilege, along with some route building is unique.  And the character special abilities are also fun.  Lot to like in this game.

After my first play, I could see this becoming a favourite game of mine. It worked well at 3. I think we got maybe a rule or two wrong? I have to read through the rule book again.

Might add that the rule book is not great for an on the fly reference.

One of the award winning games from the designers of Tzolki'n. It has great replayability with the different setup of the board every game and the different characters with assymetric powers that you can choose. Many strategies that you can follow and experiment with. A solid game, easy to understand and teach, difficult to grasp and perfect it. Good work from a very good designers duo.

This game feels like someone took my favorite portions of Kingsburg, Alien Frontiers, Kingsport Festival, threw them in a blender and made this game.  My biggest downfall for it so far is that the game feels too short so I don't have time to do everything I want to do.  I am guessing with experience I will learn to max out the limited time and dice.  Either way this game lived up to the hype I heard and will hit the table often.

A medium weight Dice Placement-game with huge replay value, recommended!

There are a couple of minor rules and exceptions for which I would've liked if they were integrated in the artwork on the board. But it's nothing you won't remember after the 1st round.

Contracts are very powerful and can't be ignored, they provide 40 to 50% of your endscore.

There are some minor production issues in the 1st edition, but don't let that stop you (missing number 48 on score track and incorrect spelling of Beijing on the board). Also, some more '1' coins would've been convenient for 4p games.

Dice worker placement with resource collections, location unlocks for minimal engine building and completing contracts ala Lords of Waterdeep...

+ Offers interesting and meaningful choices to calculate.  
+ Plays fairly quickly
+ Very nice art and graphic design
+ I like it better than Alien Frontier & Kingsburg - I may like Troyes better.

+/- Luck is somewhat of a factor

- Not really all that unique

In this worker placement game, players roll five dice which act as their workers. Based on the theme of early 13th century Marco Polo era, players gather resources, fulfill contracts or travel. The neat trick is that you can stack dice on other people's dice, but your cost to do that action is the pips on the die. You also get a special character in the game which gives you a special ability. Over five rounds, players earn points for contracts, or travelling.

I enjoyed this game from the same designers of Tzolkin. It dawned on me that you try to base your strategy around the special ability of your character. After a few games in, I'm starting to see a bit of the complexities with travelling, and the bonus tokens on some cities. It's fun and I'm looking forward to more plays. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quite enjoyable and quick-playing.  It appears the strategies are to either chase contracts, or else travel.  Your character selection at start gives you a strong unique power that you want to leverage as much as possible - and yet they feel balanced against one another.  Without these characters this game might be just another Euro, but this lifts the whole game to be something special.

I like that everyone takes the same number of actions jnlike 2 vs 5 actions in agricola and that the game has so variability with the dice and city setup etc, and theres no restocking for a worker placement which is nice. 3.2 weight is very good too imo so id like to own I thought.

Played and ehhhhh. A lot of chance in the tile flips and chip pulls and the die rolls. It's mitigated and mostly balances but char powers aren't fully balanced either. An okay game at best but not my cup of tea.

This one has a lot going for it: beautiful components, evoking theme, light weight and great variability through set-up and player powers greatly influencing gameplay, giving you a different experience every time... But it also has a lot of interconnecting downfalls like points on secret objectives randomly attributed and not equal to travel costs, low rolls have some uses but will give you much less with meager compensation, all mechanics here you've seen a hundred times, the south road is virtually a dead end, some characters are plain broken while others are third-rate and even with only 5 turns, victory is often foreseen. As of my single game? Was never first in any city, never rolled more than 16 and never choose my contracts so never a win felt more handed to me.

Worker placement game where dice are the workers, and there are restrictions of placement dependent on the dice throw. Different goods, and a transportation unit (camels) can become available and also can be traded for VPs. The game is asymmetric, each player has a character with differing abilities chosen at the beginning of the game. This element really makes the game. There is also an exploration element on a map, providing more goods and VPs.
The exploration seems weaker than the trading, but it is mostly not, therefore it should not be ignored.

Strengths: Have to plan your strategy, the order of travel, the source of money, goods and victory points. Variation of cards - that determine trading possibilities on the map -, of playing characters, of placement of small town bonuses ensure replayability for a long time.

Weaknesses: In some setups a certain character may be overpowered, therefore first choice can decide the whole game. Lucky or unlucky dice throws can decide a game.

I must admit to being a little biased because my wife got it for me for my birthday. But despite being a dice worker placement, which is not usually at the top of my list, this game really works for me.

It's streamlined and clean, the luck of the dice rolls is rarely a factor, and there's a good amount of engine building, goods collection and a little spatial element. The game rewards strategical analysis of the board and careful selection of the asymmetric characters (another plus). All the elements are tied together really nicely, and the game doesn't outstay its welcome.

About the only thing negative I would say is that there's nothing really innovative; the "soft" blocking is from Leonardo da Vinci, the dice from Alien Frontiers and the card powers from Troyes. But I don't care for innovation for innovation's sake (ironically, I like Innovation), so I'm not too bothered.

Update: bumped up rating by 1/2 a point because I've now played it 6-7 times, and every time I want to play it more.

RATING: 8.25
The components are nice, wooden pieces of good quality and they have their own shapes, the dice feel a bit light, and the board art is quite good (it includes 2 minor errata that don't affect the gameplay at all).

It's a medium to heavy route building and dice placement eurogame. The rules are not very elegant, they have minor twists and exceptions, but they are not difficult to understand and memorize. The mechanisms are nice and they are combined in an interesting way, but they are not original. The theme... Well, there is some traveling, and that's all :p

For me, its best feature is the asymmetry of the players: each one has a different power. But it's not that they have a colorful minor skill or advantage, they have a VERY POWERFUL ability that has a REALLY DEEP impact in the gameplay. When the skills are that different, you can't avoid talking about balance: people always tend to think the powers of the other players are better. I try to be objective here, and I think Matteo Polo is the worse of the suggested initial characters. Also, I think than Mercator and BerkeKhan are slightly better than Raschid. But this is just my first impression, surely the designers have tested this thoroughly and I'm wrong.

It's not an easy game to figure out. It's difficult to see the correlation in points of some of your actions, especially the traveling part.

My main concerns:
-> The powers granted by the Cities (mainly the Small Cities bonus tiles) are very different in terms of power and utility. The first players have an advantage because it's likely they will be able to travel first and take those tiles that grant powers for the rest of the game.
-> Players choices will affect your action and you will have to adapt your strategy and decisions during your turn. It has not been the fast game some players promised it would be.

The luck of the dice is there, but it's not that relevant. Low rolls are also useful, sometimes necessary.

There are enough variable elements to ensure replayability, but probably the game will lose some of its appeal when you experience (directly or indirectly) all the character powers. We'll see how the game holds up after further plays, but for the moment, it's a candidate for my best game of the year.

But of course, having played only once, I don't know the first of it :whistle:

Massively randomized setup, forcing the players to rethink their strategy for every session. Outrageous player powers, but since everyone has exactly one outrageous power, the game as a whole might actually be balanced enough. And you can always compensate by clever timing or fast route building.

Ottimo gioco di profondità media, appare quasi un family e offre una grafica e eleganza a mio avviso molto gradevole. In realtà si rivela presto come gioco profondo e longevo. Il tabellone e i benefici offerti dalle varie città infatti variano da partita a partita rendendo il tutto dinamico e non ripetitivo. Anche contratti e personaggi si alterneranno in ogni partita costringendo i giocatori a costanti cambi di strategia. Il gioco risulta nel suo svolgimento semplice e lineare, senza troppi tempi morti, anche se a prima vista il regolamento possa apparire ricco di eccezioni. Promosso a pieni voti perché offre quanto promette risultando gradevole e strategico. Un gioco che credo avrà un buon successo.

RATING: 3.5
Let's take away the fact that this is yet another game with pretty much no originality whatsoever and look at some of the other problems. The dice mitigation is flawed. The character abilities feel like they were chucked in at the last minute of playtesting to jazz the whole thing up a bit. There is no logic in the contract card hierarchy. The route-building is somewhat tortuous. I like the fact that the game keeps you involved throughout, but it is really only the dressing on another point salad.

The thing I like the most here is pace. The game really is super fast once you get to know the rules, especially for its depth. Player interaction is great, too, albeit a little scripted. Asymmetric characters give you a lot to think about. The game leaves you wanting to have 1 or 2 more rounds to finish what you started, which is, in my opinion, great.

Voyages of Marco Polo is dice worker-placement game that revolves around traveling through the silk road and fulfilling business contracts and it is just marvelous!

and now, the bad, the good, and the great (in that order)
bad: the rules are complicated to teach, partially because of insufficient explanations in the rulebook and also because of lot of exceptions to given rules (but on the other hand, the board more than helps you in understanding your available actions).
good: it is built on familiar principles from other games and while it does not bring any new ones, use of its mechanisms is clever and they make a lot of sense game-wise. Also components are done very well and the coloring really helps with immersion.
great: it is tons of fun! the theme is done perfectly, big plus (at least for me) is that the characters are real historical figures, variability of the setup is done very well and helps replayability along with different powers for your characters. And the special abilities of your characters are really interesting, powerful and absolutely gamechanging! You can be a missonary that can "jump" through oasis, merchant who receives goods for every market transaction made by other players etc. And if you dont like luck in dice rolling games, you can play as a character that chooses his own results! How crazy is that!:) really the best thing is, that all of these powers sound really game-braking but somehow they are balanced pretty well, which gives a lot of credit to ingenuity of the designers. The gameplay has quite the tempo and it also plays really well with 2. One thing that makes it a great game though, is the depth it offers. The more you play it, the more options and strategies you discover, so the game stays interesting even after repeated plays.
all in all, awesome game.

edit: have to increase the rating, as this is slowly becoming one of my all time favourites.

It was fun, but I think it leans toward the "too many different actions for me to fully enjoy" category.

Understanding the game from the start would make it more enjoyable.

RATING: 9
Beautiful game with mechanics and flourishes borrowed from others: specific character/player powers (Terra Mystica), a map with a limited amount of spaces for players to earn points(Hansa Teutonica), "contracts"/quests with resources for points (Lords of Waterdeep), and dice placement for actions(Bora Bora). Like most of Z-man's collection, Voyages of Marco Polo is malleable to many different strategies but the ones that utilize their own character power tend to be the most profitable because the game can be very punishing. It can feel very Feld-ian ie., there is so much to do in the game and a player has to completely ignore some sections of the board to focus and garner the most points; I just didn't have enough time or actions to complete everything on the board. I'd like to play this game again. It was a fun and enjoyable (mercifully short Euro) experience! 

After playing a couple more times with the expansion characters and getting a feel for the general strategy, I have fallen in love with this game even more now. What I really appreciate about the game is that the game end scoring never changes; there's no mysterious "blue shell" mechanic that messes up the best laid plans to win. Marco Polo has gone up in my estimation.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
"Excellent low-confrontation euro that plays pretty quickly, with plenty of room for clever combos. What sets it apart are the super-powerful player roles."

What I like:
- Player role superpowers
- Low confrontation, with less hard blocking than typical worker placement
- Clever combos
- Thematic enough
- Forces a lot of really interesting and tough decisions, but avoids heavy AP
- Strong both in tactical play and long-term strategies
- Plays quickly for its depth

What I don't like:
- Bigger resource pieces for 3x aren't different enough
- Dice places on board should indicate placement rules more clearly
- Transformations should visually indicate whether they are once or once-per-pip
- A couple player scaling rules (or non-rules) seem a bit funky, but I haven't tried 2p so might end up disagreeing with myself on this one

After my 3rd game, I bumped my rating up from an 8 to a 9. 

The 20-30 minutes per player estimate seems accurate, even for learning games. I think the BGG-voted weight of 3.2 might be just a bit high.

Ok so it took some time but there it is. from 9 to 8.5 to 8 and back up to 9 again. It took me a long time to get this game and just how interesting it cane be. The many possible options that are given at set-up. 

Great great game. This and Russian Railroads seem to be at the forefront of a new type if Eurogames that emphasise open-ended game mechanic (you don't need to do everything to win) and opportunity (look at the set-up and detect synergies with your strategies).

A current favourite.

Artwork is quite poor. Z Man need to take a look at their competitors and see how high the standards are out there.

Game design is good - dice & worker placement, asymmetrical player powers and p to p movement. All very well integrated into a seamless game but no wow factor after the first play...

Relatively short game time is a plus too.

Played with 2 players and still not really wowed by this game...

You never really have the resources to do anything cool and if is very difficult to move around the map.

Alien Frontiers is a similar dice placement game but is much more attractive and fun in my book....

This is a recognizable "italian" design. Very convoluted rules with many exceptions to the: for example there are 3 ways dice must be placed on the board. Something to remember throughout the game. I like the different setup very much.
I am not sure if there was really the need for different character cards.
I'd like to try this game without using them.
Still the game flows very well and offers a fullfilling experience even if it is very borderline to "work".
Update (27.03.2017): I raised my rating because this game keeps shining after repeated play. It isn't work anymore, it is fun and fast at two player. The mechanics just click with me. I love it.

Based on one play: A worker placement game that I felt did not live up to others in the genre. You place workers to get resources in order to complete tasks while also moving along some routes to complete missions. But the two seem to not fit well together and you can concentrate on only one, whichever will get you more points. Not a very exciting game and many others in the genre are better.

The Voyages of Marco Polo is a difficult game--and that's a good thing. Points are hard to come by, movement costs seem insurmountable at the start of the game, and the five game turns feel incredibly limiting. Despite this, there are a huge variety of different approaches you can take to this game, and those approaches will change every game because of the variable player powers and board spaces. What's common in all of it, though, is the need to form a plan--you won't be able to go to very many places (usually 5 turns will mean 5 places if you plan it out right), so you'll need to carefully decide which action spaces you want to open up for yourself, which income spaces are essential, and which cities to go after because they're on your route cards. Unlike other dice placement games, other people don't block you out of spots, but they might make it more expensive. Really, there's a ton to explore in this game, and I feel like I've only scratched the surface.

Very interesting worker placement game, with different ways to get points and win. Each player has random powers, which, however, are not all of them as easy to play; some are very versatile, like an extra die, others are dependent on following a specific strategy.

After 5 games i played, it seems to have a high replayability. Before you start to play, you are highly focused on the outlay on the board. The different bonus-tiles are placed on different position on the map each time. Therefore you have to figure out a strategy, before you start the first step. Then it becomes extrem tactical. Which step to take first.
Makes my head burning. I managed to take in one step all three black dices in a two player game (including the bonus tile). To figure out such synergies is the fun-part of that game. If you don´t like puzzleing, don´t touch this game.
I like it a lot.

Quickly becoming a favorite a handful of games in. The asymmetrical player powers are so fun to play around with, and the strategical depth is really there, planning ahead is crucial. The variable character powers, random city cards and bonus tiles really makes this game feel different every time. Nice playtime as well, second game (3 player) with two new players (unexperienced in board games) clocked in at 1 hour and 15 min, which is a dream. Depth to game time ratio is near perfect. Oh, and did I mention it's fun as well? Very very fun. It plays extremely well at all player counts, which I love, as our group is small and often it's just 2 of us.

Edit: Playing with the traveling characters (teleporter etc) is TOUGH to me, a lot of planning ahead and every time I try one out, I lose the game. So there are definitely some balancing issues, but they are not as much with the characters, as with players being on the same level.

Edit 2: 15+ plays later, still my number one, replayability is extremely high, and everything just clicks. As close to a perfect 10 as you can get.

I got to play this game at my local meetup today. There isn't a really new mechanism in the game that stands out but the mechanisms in the game meshes well. It feels like the more Euro games that I play the quicker I can grasps the rules.

The dice throwing at the beginning felt a bit like Yspahan and the dice/worker placement feels like Alien Frontier although in a less cut throat way.

The most interesting thing is the asymmetrical powers that players draft at the beginning of the game which gives the players different powers to work with.

It's a solid mid-weight Euro that should feel very familiar to Euro gamers. Maybe it is a little bit too familiar to me so the rating is a 7/10.

RATING: 8
At the start of this game, you are assigned an incredibly strong player power, and are given two cards each with two destinations on the central map. One of the many ways of getting points in this game is by making it to all four destinations, however, in this game, the tightness of resources and the shortage of rounds will make accomplishing even modest goals, very difficult. In fact, I think this is the most claustrophobically tight game I've ever played, which is saying something. Your plans will not work in this game, as you will inevitably be one short of whatever it is you needed, be it gold, camels, money or just one more round. 

To exacerbate this feeling, your workers are all rolled dice, and then they have the strength of action equal to their facing. When you take an action needing multiple dice, you resolve for the lowest value in the lot. Then, in order to resolve an action that someone else has chosen before you, you have to pay money equal to the lowest value in your lot of dice. This means that higher values rolled get you bigger results, but you might wind up not being able to afford those results, so having lower values makes your actions cheaper.  Thankfully the game has rules to allow you to spend the precious camels that you desperately needed to use for other things, on mitigating your dice luck.

 The game has an extremely high amount of variation. There are lots of player powers, all different, the city spaces get populated with randomize cards and there are enough of those that you might not see the same card for many games, and you can randomize the positions of the different income city abilities, to make it so that no path is quite the same twice. The game is an intriguing, but also often frustrating puzzle that I can't decide if I love or hate.

A good dice placement game with a lot going on, but not so much as to be overwhelming. There are a lot of rules to explain, but when you're actually playing they make sense and seem fairly natural.

No, nagyon nagy újrajátszhatósági faktorral ellátott, komoly, de mégsem agyégető euro. Nem ég szénné az ember agya közben. Persze igen komoly döntéseket kell meghozni, de mégsem éreztem, hogy beszorultam. De azért kiszorítottak a végére egy számomra fontos akcióból, ami a végeredményt is befolyásolta.
A fizimiskája nekem kevésbé tetszik, és az ikonrendszert is szokni kell, de igen jól megtanulható. Elsőre furcsa egy kicsit.
Szóval remek darab és játszanám még, de elsőre 2 parti elég volt belőle. A karakterek sokat dobnak rajta, nem tudom mennyire van kiegyensúlyozva, de kettőből kettőt a matteo polo vitt el. Érdekes, hogy kevés játék váltott eddig ki ilyen hosszan-tartó diskurzust, a hogyan kellett volna, és a tied erősebb karakter beszélgetésből.:)

This is an upper medium weight dice placement game, that has some really solid strategy. But in some ways there is just a bit too much going on for me to be absolutely in love with it. Really, to me what makes the game are the super powerful special abilities. I like it a lot but there are several other worker placement games that I would rather play over this one at any point and time. The art is ugly. But I will say, I need more plays before I can definitively say this one is not a great one. This one still has a chance to be a joy in my collection. But for now it's just kind of like, out of the games on my shelf I really would never want to play this one over probably 40-60 other games. That's out of a 100 games total by the way. Which means it will be hard for me to finally get this one to the table again to give it another chance.

I love clever dice mechanics in eurogames, so this seemed like a no brainer for me (plus, I'm a big fan of "Tzolk'in", so there's also that). And they give you individual player powers too?! I'm sold!

Wonderful eurogame, even if it doesn't do anything new. First of all, it has replayability in spades: the characters, the random action cards in cities, random board composition... It's a Feld-level replayability - each and every game is different, a new puzzle to solve. Not a lot of interaction here, but it's more about optimizing your plan to get the most points, so if you're not a fan of that - avoid. 

It's also quick (40 minutes with two players?), while still giving a feel of a solid eurogame and plays very well at all player counts. Two thumbs up.

One of my favourite games. Every play of this game is fun and satisfactory.

Reasons I love this game:
1) Well balanced characters. There is not 1 character that is overpowering than others. All are perfectly well balanced.
2) Thematic. I generally dont care about theme much but while playing Marco Polo, I feel I am part of that world and going through the same ordeal that Marco might have gone through.
3) Dice worker placement. This is one factor that I love and hate about this game. I love it because whatever roll is of dice, there are multiple actions that you can perform.
4) Objectives and contracts. These are the two factors that streamlines the game and avoids it from becoming sandboxy.
5) Deep euro. Even though game is played only over 5 rounds, it is very deep and you can plan your turns ahead. I love it!

Things I dont like/understand:
1) Dice placement. Sometimes, if you consistently roll less value then it can be little difficult to plan your moves. This is not a problem with 2 players but more players, it can become an issue.
2) Blocking of places in 2p. Certain places are blocked in 2p and we did not understand the reason behind it since values of the blocked dice are irrelevant.

That's all I can think about. And honestly, these are inconsequential reasons. The love I have for this game will never ever go.

I very much enjoy this game. 
First of all, this game is beautyful. The board, the different coloured dice, the wooden pieces are all beutyfully crafted, it is a joy to look at the board during play. 
The core of the game is its innovative dice placement phase, where each player places dice on different spaces on the board from his own pool (5 dice normally). There are spaces which players can share with one another (albeit with serious cost increase for everyboday except the first player) and there are the big citys on the map, where variable action spaces are set at the beginning of each game, and this spaces can only be used by the players who have trading houses in these cities, which means that the caracthers have to reach these cities during the game if they would like ot use their powers. So based on what (secret) goal cards you have, what are the different action spaces on the cities, how the (variable) bonus tile distribution looks like, you begin the game by planning a rough plan how you would like to win the game. 
Then you spend the rest of the game, trying to realize that plan, fighting with the dice and the other players with the limited action spaces; all this in a very tight economic environment, where every resource is very scarce and the timing of your actions is crucial. 
The icing on the cake are the variable player powers. An on variable I mean VARIABLE. At first sight these powers seems gamebreaking. All of them! And yet, somehow all these different powers make the game ballanced, at the end none of them seem to be overpowered COMPARED TO THE OTHERS. 
Another plus point for me is the great deal of variability in the game: you can change almost everything in this game: the small/big town bonus markers, insta bonuses and action spaces, the characters, your goal cards, just EVERYTHING. 
No two games will be the same based on these criteria.

Received as a gift for Christmas 2016. Only 1 play so far with the family but very much enjoyed it. Considering we also love Tzolkin this one will be played much more over over the coming months and think it likely our rating for it will rise. Great tight play with challenging decisions - do you emphasise traveling for points, completing contracts or a mix of the two. The board setup and different characters means that it is likely each game and board situation will play out very differently. Looking forward to more paly sessions of this. A keeper for our collection.

I couldn't tell you how to win this game. I am total rubbish at everything these designers make. That being said, I still know they make solid games. I just think the winning strategies don't tend to be the strategies I find fun to pursue. Great game. Just not a great game for ME.

RATING: 7
After 2 plays, the game is starting to grow on me.  Paradoxically, one of the most interesting aspects of the game, the characters, is also one of its biggest weaknesses.  The characters are fairly well balanced in power level (despite some of the comments you'll see on BGG), but I think they push you too strongly into a single strategic path.  If you are William of Rubruck (you can put trading posts down just by passing through cities), you have to make your whole game about traveling as much as possible.  It would be hard to imagine pursuing a contract strategy with that character.   Other characters take away your ability to really participate in certain aspects of the game.  For example, the character who lets you set the value of each of your dice, takes away an interesting aspect of the game, namely, having to deal with the values that come up on your dice.  

It is definitely a well-designed game, but I'm not sure that it is deserving of all of the awards and praise that it has been receiving of late.  I'd like to play it again, however, and it is possible that my opinion of it will improve.

(The Voyages of) Marco Polo is a straight forward Euro game, with the action selection mechanism being a dice based worker placement: you roll your dice (=workers) and depening on their number they can the various action with varying effectivity. Higher numbers result in better outcomes, but may make the action more expensive to execute (so higher is not necessarily better).

Other core mechanisms are set collection to fulfill orders. You also turn in your resources to travel the (rather beautiful) map, on which you race to different spots. The game gives you quite a bit of guidance, since your long term goal is to get to Beijing (I know, there are strategies that ignore this), but also give you some direction which way to go (individual goal cities). The cities have a variable setup with different bonus tiles and bonus actions. 

I do not really know why the designers put individual player powers (which have a great effect on gameplay) into the game, especially with some being "easier to play" (is this the new term for "unbalanced") than others. In my view Marco Polo is not a game that I want to sink my teeth into too much to figure out who to play each character most efficiently. I would have preferred these power to be absent, such that you can have an enjoyable and balanced play, when you play Marco Polo from time to time.

I have to add that I am really impressed with the production quality of this game. Each resource has its own unique wooden token (they could just have used cubes instead), the cardboard is very thick and graphic design is both beautiful and functional. To me this is the third game in a row (Russian Railroads, Helios) by Hans-im-Glück which has very nice components.

So I am not super into dice placement games to begin with, with some exceptions (Castles of Burgundy, Troyes). I usually like variable player power games, but I feel like the powers are so different from each other that I wonder about game balance.

Just played this and it's a good, challenging, and fun game with a variety of strategies partly depending on your starting character.  I like the mix of luck with the dice and cards/tiles and strategy and it's a very tactical game as you need to consider what other players will do at each point.

RATING: 8.5
played once, but did not complete the game due to time constraints. Will certainly give it another try. Has some original concepts with dice as workers to be placed. High numbers on your dice are not always an advantage. Different characters for the each player guarantee different routes to victory. From the first couple of plays I get the impression that going for contracts is the best strategy.

Não é dos jogos que mais me encantam devido ao desiquilibrio das personagens, mas reconheço-lhe valor e é dos que proporcionam maior rejogabilidade, sem margem para dúvidas. Além de tudo no jogo mudar de um momento para o outro, Marco Polo cobiça ao olhar, pelos componentes de madeira encantadores - ao bom estilo Hans Im Glueck; pelos tiles rubustos com cortes bem originais; pelas regras muito complexas mas ainda assim acessíveis (embora não tão intuitivo como devia) e pela dependencia da sorte, controlável mas que pode chegar a ser irritante...

Excellent tight medium weight WP-game with great replay value. Really smooth system that offers players many options. The game is very well balanced. It is one of those games where players need to realize how they can themselves balance the game if some players have advantage. Very much reminds Terra Mystica in that sense. Very nice components. Rewards good play but yet is approachable by new players. Scales extremely well, a bit tighter with more players but very tense experience in all player counts. Truly exceptionally good medium+ weight WP-game, brilliant, just damn brilliant.

I've been hearing about how good the "out of print" game was since I got into gaming. I was itching for a reprint so I could get my hands on a copy. I even bought the expansion character pack during that time. Well, the wait was definitely worth it. The game is fantastic. The game play is fun and the different characters and powers are a blast. I can't wait to play this one over and over again. It will have a new feel with every game with all the random setup and with each new character. Another expansion is on the horizon. There's so much left in the box for me to explore already, its hard to think it needs anything else. I'm sure I'll be checking it out and likely purchasing it as well.

This game is a tactical brain-burner, which unfortunately means it also suffers from downtime issues. The random player powers add a nice level of differentiation for the players. I thought the random setup of the board and hidden objectives add some decent replayability to the game. The dice placement seems very restrictive, but the bonus actions allow dynamic space for a player to maneuver and adjust.

I struggled a bit with what I expected going into this game, and what I actually get out of it.

I initially thought, when I first looked into this game, that it was a route building game driven by an interesting dice placement mechanism. To some extent it is, but after a couple plays what I've come to realize is that this game is really more of a difficult resource management game. 

Another thing I thought this game would have is an engine building system. Your route building potentially gives you things at the start of your turn, and you unlock more locations to place dice as the game goes along, which allows you to more easily do things. Unfortunately, I didn't get that feeling while I was actually playing. I guess this probably varies depending on the random card draws to set up the board initially. Even then, building your route is very difficult; it takes a lot of money and/or camels, which can be tricky and time-consuming to come by, especially if there aren't money-making locations on the map. You don't really unlock a lot of abilities until well into the game, and even then things feel nearly as difficult on the final turn as they are on the first.

A good balance of lucky and strategy.  You don't get locked out of the worker placement spots but you do have to pay and money is tight.  You really have to plan ahead but also adapt quickly as other players will  inevitably take the spots you want.   Very fun game overall.

--Feb 2018-- While the aesthetic isn't something I particularly admire (that is, "roll dice and do something clever with them") I found it quite tolerable.  The asymmetry is fun; the decisions are fine.  And there's a bit of long-term planning possible.  Damning with faint praise, I think.

This game is very quick! I was incredibly surprised at how fast it played. I only played with two players and it felt over before it began. It was very cool, mechanically, though with the starting character I had, I almost felt like I was a bit too pigeon holed. I basically lived the entire game at the resource area completing contracts. I ended up winning because of that, but just barely. I don't think I'm as crazy about it as everyone else seems to be (ranked 37??), but it is a good, fast game.

Will it stay in my collection??? Might need one more play to solidify my opinion.

RATING: 8
(15 plays)


2plays: Awesome awesome awesome, exactly what I was hoping it'd be, based on initial reading. A very strategic game that will require you to bust out the bluprints and analyze every dot, from the get go. I love that... Make a couple of crapola plays, and your booty is fried. The variable characters with special abilities will push you into a certain path, that will most likely reward you with the highest chance of victory. This mind you.. is a premature opinion based on only two plays. The goal cards are quite difficult to complete, if you get cities that are far from each other. Money is tighter than a.. Well, pretty tight! So traveling ain't easy. The game plays soo fast which I can't praise enough, the artwork is phenomenal and the components are premium stuff. Oh, and get those contracts early!! Trust me. All in all, this is a winner and I suspect it'll be a smash hit for the the company. Played two 3p games and it was def better than 2. I'd love to play with four sometime, but I'd be perfectly fine if I play with 3 only from here on. What a game.

I have lowered rating because after 8 games, I am beginning to think that contracts are the the viable strategy. Completing all of your end game cities seems like an after thought. Is is important to travel to certain cities for the actions that they provide yes, but the person that starts amassing early contract points and is able to get ahead, will most likely, based on my experience, always win the game. I don't like that too much. But I like the game a lot, so I'll keep exploring and hopefully prove myself wrong.

Another update: After more plays, I believe that contracts aren't THE viable strategy. A strong path no doubt, but it all depends on the initial board set up and character you're using. Some configurations aligned with certain characters in a way, where travel to certaim places are the key to thrive. Because of the location's specific action, you can make a killing using your chracter's speficic power. Other games, these alignments don't happen or perhaps aren't that obvious, at first. So, your success im this game is based on being the best reader of the board and other player's potential strategy. This is a very very strategic game, esp with two players. Amother thing, contracts are also easier to complete at that count. I imagine with 4, thinking that contracts are your viable strategy, will get you nowhere. And one last thing, this game is so accessible to play because of it's lighning quick playtime. It's a strong reason on why I personally keep coming back to it. Pure excellence and so deserving of it's huge success and current ranking. I cannot wait for my expansion to arrive, those new folks look insanely OP! But just like everyone thought the current ones were OP, am sure they'll be perfectly balanced to co-exist in the game's habitat.

Discovered one major design flaw when playing.  You can win the game just completing contracts without having to do any traveling establishing trading posts in cities.  Would have been more realistic and thematic if the two had been intertwined in someway such as completing a contract in a specific city.  Not the best Euro I have played but decent.

Lots of forward planning here to make the most of all the town bonuses, your special character ability and all the while looking to beat your opponents to the the spots you need to avoid paying a late fee. Very engaging. Lots to explore as city bonuses and character abilities change from game to game and sometimes with player counts. I'm enjoying it.

Update: Great idea, but the best dice roller usually wins. There's the illusion of control, but a player rolling fives and sixes will normally crush a player rolling threes no matter which character they choose. That said, it's still fun and challenging finding the right combinations to go for, reading the board and finding the right path for your character. So I still rate it highly, but I just don't find the middle level rolls compensated in the same manner as the low roll compensation, and the low roll compensation is paltry too. Hey, it's a dice game after all. Still enjoying it, but hoping to roll high!

Update 2; Find it plays better with three players. Less chaotic, unpredictable, and yet still a good amount of player interaction.

My favorite part of this game is how every character you can be in the game seems completely broken and overpowered.

When and how to use your dice to move/get resources is always interesting.

An excellent game deserving of the awards it has received.  Dice placement wit many paths to victory.  Involves contract fulfillment and route connecting, and there is not enough time to do everything.  Rule-braking asymmetric powers for each player appear balanced even when it does not appear that way on the surface.  Iconography abounds in various board tiles, but is manageable.  Feels like a "Feld" game but is not.  Tons of variability.  Plays well at 2.

Really solid worker/dice placement game with contract fulfillment, route establishment, different starting character powers.  You really need to pay attention to what you are doing tho, especially when traveling as you can end up getting stuck somewhere that you can't get out of for lack of coins - the south routes.  I really like it and if you like Troyes, this has some familiar elements to it, though it seemed a bit heavier and a little more unforgiving.

Played twice with 3P. Marco Polo is a solid, conventional Euro about collecting resources and using them to either travel or fulfill contracts. Central to the design is a simple mechanism in which sets of dice are played into locations to take the corresponding actions. The only catch is that if there are dice placed in that location already, you have to pay for placement. The other point of interest is that each player has unique abilities which will influence individual decisions throughout.

While the decisions in Marco Polo are tense, the decision space is hardly original. As one player remarked, a lot of the game's replay value hinges upon assessing the relative strength of characters based on the board setup and optimising their abilities. I agree with that sentiment, but that isn't a compelling enough reason for me to revisit the game multiple times.

[5 plays] Played in person, liked it pretty well. Played it on Yucata and didn't remember the rules well enough to enjoy too much and performed poorly. Got it back on the table in person thanks to Carter and now I'm feeling like I'm getting a good enough grip to enjoy it again. It is a very interesting game, although I have reservations about the variable player powers being equal.

Update after 4th play: I'm sensing that the random nature of the board set-up combined with the variable player powers makes this an otherwise good game whose final outcome can be heavily influenced by random factors pre-determined at the start.

I have completely re-written this after realizing that I was wrong about my initial negative opinion. The game is great, it just took me three games to realize that. Since then, it gets better with every game played. The options are incredible, but accessible, and the possibilities for developing strategies (long-term goals) and tactics (how to get there best) are great.
The experience is quite overwhelming at the beginninge, and planning is absolutely necessary. The game can be a bit harsh on mistakes, as you need a constant flow of assets to keep going. It gets reasonable quick after one or two games. The options are much clearer then.
At the moment, my favourite game and I want to explore it much more.

Excellent jeu. Le genre de jeu où tu fais ton possible selon le hasard des dés et les variantes d'une partie à l'autre. Ces facteurs peuvent ou ne peuvent pas favoriser/bien fitter avec le pouvoir de ton personnage et ça donne ce que ça donne. Les 5 rondes passent très rapidement et en y repensant, il y a toujours plusieurs possibilités de quelques plans de match selon les circonstances d'une partie. Il y a aussi pleins de décisions déchirantes à prendre pour savoir bien s'adapter en cours de partie.

--------------------------
Update décembre 2015 : Avec les 4 nouveaux personnages de la mini-expansion, pour maintenant 12 personnages au total, et les cadeaux comme nouvelle sorte de récompense, je pense que la variabilité du jeu est maintenant parfaite. Je vois plein de stratégies à explorer selon les cartes cité qui sont pigées et j'ai hâte d'essayer chaque personnage. J'adore ce jeu. Il y a tellement de choses qui varient d'une partie à l'autre, surtout dans le setup de départ et l'emplacement des cartes de cité est vraiment important dans le choix du personnage.

Játékostársam rögtön a Kingsburggal hasonlította össze a játék után és tényleg arra hasonlít a legjobban, de annál szerteágazóbb és mélyebb kicsit. A grafika és dizájn viszont ugyanolyan kimagasló. Kockákkal dobunk a körünk elején és azokkal végzünk "munkáslehelyezéseket". Van térkép, amin utazni tudunk, amihez célkártyákat is kapunk, ha két-két várost meglátogatunk a játék során. Ezen kívül még a különböző nyersanyagok beadásával megoldott küldetések adnak győzelmi pontot. Fix öt körös játék, ami többedikre gyorsan lemehet. Az újrajátszhatósági faktora elég magas, mert minden városban változnak játékonként az elérhető bónuszok és a mindenki számára a játék elején választott szerep is. Ez egy elég érdekes színt ad még a társasnak, ugyanis ezek a szerepek rendkívül erősek és ezért jelentősen építjük majd rá a stratégiánkat a játék során. Jól működő játék lett a Marco Polo. Egyedüli hibájának talán a kezdőjátékos sorrendjét eldöntő mechanizmust érzem, illetve azt, hogy magának a kezdőjátékosnak talán kicsit nagy az előnye. A top100-as helyezését egy játék után még erősnek érzem, de tetszett.

[2015-10-25]
Második játékra megkapja a 8-ast, mert viszonylag gyors a játék, a szerepek elég kiegyenlítettek. Ahogy korábban említettem nagyon fontos a jó szerepválasztás, amit szerintem erősen befolyásol a pályára sorsolt bónuszok és azok elhelyezkedése. A kezdőjátékost még mindig kicsit erősnek érzem, de legyen csak ennyi baja a játéknak.

Voyages of Marco Polo took some time to really reveal itself to me. My initial plays were fun and full of promise, but I felt that something was missing. It always seemed that I was one turn short of accomplishing my goals. After more time with the game, it eventually clicked. Like most designs from this team, repeated plays are rewarded. Each character gives you something different and there are various paths you can take to victory. The game moves at a nice pace, even though there can be a bit of thinking for each round. It's also very eye catching with all of the different colors for the art and pieces on the board. This is definitely one of my favorite games.

Solid euro, very tight with difficult decisions to make. It looks complex but it's actually fairly easy to play and teach. Those prone to AP might slow the game down a bit, but otherwise it's fairly smooth. Quite a bit of variety in what to do with a couple of broad strategies to focus on. As with all good Euros, there's never quite enough resources to achieve everything you want to do, so you must make a decision and hope you didn't screw it up.

Had to play it a couple of times before I got a favorable opinion. This game reminds of concordia as in maximizing the effectiveness of your turns is better than making sacrifices for grand strategies. My only compliant, and this is a preference, The game is called "Voyages" of Marco Polo, but travelling is not as important as fulfilling contracts(personal missions, like in lords of waterdeep). Still, an excellent medium weight euro.

Truly an excellent game. Love rolling dice and having to use them in a variety of actions, and the way that the added cost of going to the same location is done makes it so that you're often not too badly screwed by a bad roll. You've got to move across the board and satisfy contracts, and you just always feel like if you make a weak move, it will cost you dearly. It plays quickly and veteran gamers will quickly understand and grasp the mechanics, but I still have yet to figure out how to play it well. I'm excited by the challenge to come back and try to succeed with it. Lots of variability in the setup and the characters you get ensure plenty of replayability as well.

A few more plays and I'm just kind of finding this game annoying. Stupid dice. Hard to actually move around. Random bonus cards. Bleh.

---
1 play, 2er. Good, but likely much better with 3 or 4.

A cool worker-placement/action-selection game where the workers are dice (high rolls are good -- stronger action -- but low rolls can be too; can be cheaper to place), the actions require different numbers (1-3) of dice, and you pay money to select an action if another die is already there. And a ton of variety: you only play with subsets of the action cards each game, and the position of each is also random; contracts come out in random order; your goal cards, dealt at start of game, are also random (dealt 4 from a big deck; keep 2). Oh! You also get a unique power for the game! All that randomness in the setup means you'll have a lot to think about at the start of the game, figuring out what sort of strategy to choose, where to move your little dude, what fits best with your power and initial cards, etc.

Neat game, with a lot of "turn zero" thinking but, thankfully, also some randomness (dice rolls) during the game -- so it's not all about the setup! Looking forward to playing with more players.

RATING: 8
This is a dice-rolling worker placement game very similar in mechanics to things like Troyes, Alien Frontiers, or Kingsburg.  The main thing that sets this game apart from those similar titles are that each player takes the role of a character with an extremely game-breaking power that adds a great deal of variability and excitement to each game.

As I said, gameplay is pretty standard dice-rolling worker placement fare.  At the start of each round all players will roll their dice and this is their pool of "actions".  Players will then take turns placing their dice on action spaces, some take more than one die, to take the specified action.  One of the neat features here is most spaces provide a benefit equivalent to the number of pips on the die and if multiple dice are played you take the benefit equivalent to the lowest die in that set.  Most places can also be used by multiple players but if you aren't first you need to pay money equal to the number of pips on your lowest die.  This forces players who are late to an action space to make risk/reward decisions since the better the benefit the higher the cost.  This is all in the service of scoring victory points in different ways such as fulfilling orders and traveling across Europe/Asia on a map.

That's nothing new but what is are the character tiles each player is assigned at the start of the game.  Characters and player powers aren't new but these are no minor benefits, they are huge game breaking benefits that completely change the game for different players in different ways.  For example, in my first game my character never rolled dice, I got to choose the number on my dice each time I placed them.  That's huge and immediately other players were concerned it was so much more powerful than theirs.  However I would have actually rather had any other player's character than my own despite how awesome he was.  One player got a resource every time any other player got a resource with their action.  One player never had to pay money to take a used action space.  Another got an extra die and free contract at the start of each turn.  These characters also serve to direct players into a strategy and makes it feel like each player is playing their very own, very different game each time they play.

What is most impressive is how the characters, despite their crazy, sweeping powers, feel balanced.  My first game ended with very close scores.  The spread for the top 3 players in a 4-player game was 3 points.  The art is nice and the components are solid.  Everyone likes to feel all-powerful while not causing balance issues and this game manages that very difficult task.  If I had one negative it is the rulebook.  The rulebook thinks it is helping players by teaching them the game piecemeal and out-of-order giving a broad overview then introducing more complicated and minute rules after.  I don't personally like to learn a game this way but even if I did this makes it difficult for players to find and refer back to specific rules after they do know how to play the game.  All-in-all though that is a minor compliant for a very good worker placement game.

While a game based on trading in the mediterranean (and Asia in this game) is nothing new, this games adds variable player powers that takes it to a whole another level. I love how all the player powers seem so good that you think they must be broken, but they are not. I also love the amount of variability in the cards/tokens placed on the board. I think the small expansion (promo?) is a great addition if you love this game. It adds a few more characters and contracts for even more replayability.

Classic euro game. Players manage a set of dice in order to chose the best possible actions, getting goods and apply for VP's. The interaction is interesting and all of the mechanisms blend well together in the game. 

Overall a Hans im Gluck kind of game, which is positive.

Maybe an unfair rating after a single play but any game rated an 8 or 9 I liked on my first play and still like. The money in the game is too tight. You can seem to find a way to get almost anything you need one way or another, except money which you need a lot of. Had high hopes for this after watching Rahdo do a run-through. The variable set-up is great, sadly, the game just fell flat for me.

There is nothing like the smell of a HIG game upon opening for the first time. Proper card board nose tickle. There is also an annual comfort - you sort of know what you are going to get from their early year mid weight release. 2015's entry looks to be the best for some time. Ther eis nothing ground breaking in this dice placement/contract/move around a map game - however the designers (Tzolkin) seem to have pared the game down and managed to leave a lot of options in the game. Looking forward to first play.

So its the normal die placement conversion type game with lotsof options from  variable board set up and character powers - I am surprised i am enjoying this.

Slightly bogs down towards end game as we start crunching the min/max points. Maybe this will be eliminated with more play.

Does not feel very interactive. Interaction seems to come from getting to main actions before others, reaching major cities first, grabbing black dice and Bejing and using big city actions.

Wot i wrote for the Meatballs

'Stravinky’s spring was heralded by the sound of the ice cracking on the Neva river, mine (apart from a bluebell wood walk) is the just opened aroma of a Hans Im Gluck boardgame. The heady cardboard aroma is enhanced by the interior box art, and the comforting Menzel style graphical design. There are no surprises here, its part of the annual cycle of my gaming life. Every year HIG release a middle weight Euro after the Nuremberg fair. All games have a smell, HIG's conjures up images of perfect German families (with the TV switched off - its not even a flat screen), one parent back from their job as an engineer at a factory that makes something, the other perhaps a green energy research scientist. The two children have cycled though fields home from school. They then share the joy of opening the new game and settle down to play.

Some HIG titles don't make far past the rite of box opening. Marco Polo though has made it through 3 games and might be a keeper (Donna likes it). It has nothing original in the game play –you play dice to take actions (mainly get stuff) , supplemented by bonus actions (clever stuff that enhances the main actions) and you fulfil contracts and move around a map gathering more stuff as you go along. You have a character that gives you super powers. There are quite a few of these and their abilities are varied, more variety is added by randomly adding actions and bonuses to the cities your dude travels through retracing Polo’s steps to Beijing. It feels like Terra Mystica in that you choose a character to try and try to work out your puzzle journey from the outset with other players as potential timing nuisances rather than in your face obstructions. However unlike TM it plays quite quickly and the conversions of stuff to VPs don't stretch out to the crack of doom. The box smell lingers, maybe if I move the open box from the games table the magic will be gone. '

Allthough the theme first tired me: 
Brillant. A mechanical mixture of Terra Mystica and Castles of Burgundy - and as good as these! Nothing left, that a board game can achieve – unless you don't like euros. 

Why?  
(After 2 complete games): 

First game and impression 
Very good. BUT, contracts seemed to be the most effective strategy – travelling seemed not worth while. 

Second game 
With Johannes Caprini (the one, that gets 3 coins and that jumps between oases). The game runs surprisingly. I did fulfill only one (!) contract for the whole game (the starting one), I could use the »jump«-bonus only one time, travelled the (expensive) south route and … won the game in the last round (about 70 points). 

It didn't expect, that this could be possible after the first game. Otherwise I know, that this isn't repeatable; but it shows the variability and unpredictability of the game, depending on the setting. I look forward to other and similar experiences. 

Because of that: not only 8 or 9, but 10 points!

Surprisingly fast and simple HiG euro where players move merchant pawns around a map, scoring points by resource conversion, completing contracts, placing houses in secret cities etc. Actions are triggered by placing dice from a personal pool, but dice can be adjusted or re-rolled (compare Troyes etc.) so this is less random than it sounds.

The game's claim to fame and immediate point of interest is that each player receives a character which seems grotesquely broken in one way or another -- e.g., one has two merchant meeples, one can teleport around the map, one can set dice to any face instead of rolling them. In practice, though, these are all less interesting than they sound: they inform strategy but action costs are such that they are less powerful than they initially appear.

My biggest qualm is that hidden goal cards can actually be quite difficult to achieve. Because the initial setup is random and city cards are uneven, a player able to choose goal cards with good synergy both with each other and with cities they are planning to visit can get an unfair advantage. 

Still, the variety makes it one of the best point-salad-y euros I've played in some time -- likely the best since Russian Railroads.

I was extremely impressed with this game.  There is no extraordinary hook like the gears in Tzolk'in, but it is an extremely solid worker placement/resource management game that is better than the sum of it's parts.

I expect my rating to move up on subsequent plays.

I won this game by a camel but it's not because I was especially good at it. It was mostly because my player special ability was that any time another player got goods at the market, I would get one also. And of course everyone has to go to the market. So I was just just constantly receiving goods and turning them in for contracts and not even bothering to travel around on the map part past one stop. 
While the dice mechanic was pretty good, the game mostly seemed a themeless,  insipid conversion exercise.

Interesting take on the worker placement use of dice.  The big plus are the variable powers (which are huge) and the variable set up gives this a huge amount of replay and make you think about the best way to use your variable powers.  The methods of scoring are balanced.  As I have seen people win focussing on contracts, focussing on travelling or using a combination of both and scoring off the action cards.

After 7 plays all I can say is that each play has been quite different.

In many respects, its just a "gather resources and convert them to VP" game, but there are a few ways of approaching things, with variable board setup and [i]seriously[/i] different player abilities, all topped off with the need to make plans based on what dice values you've rolled.

I've had one or two plays where I've felt "Yes: this is all coming together nicely", and one or two plays where I've felt it a struggle to achieve anything.

tl;dr: solid - of course - but not very original

A game from the designers of [thing=126163][/thing] developed by the masters of development at Hans im Glück, of course that showed up on my radar. And as expected, this game works very will indeed. But it is mainly a recycling of well known elements. Use dice to perform actions. Gather resources, travel the map, build settlements, fulfill orders, score points. It's all done slightly different but in a very familiar way.
But there is no denying that even without doing anything really new this is a very solid design than is certainly worth playing if you like strategic middleweight euros.

So much to love about this game.  Tight money management, area control, racing to get to key spots.  I really like that every die roll is viable.  High value pips are fantastic for collecting goods, while low value ones are great for travel or when you have to pay extra to select an action previously chosen by your opponents.  Characters seem completely over powered but somehow every game I've played has had tight scores.

I enjoy this game very much. Rules are straightforward and easy to grasp (thanks to the great rulebook). Playing flows naturally. The beauty of the game rests in the agony of choices: so much to do, but so little time (5 rounds) and so little resources. The game combines worker placement (where you appoint dice to actions on the board, the pips make how strong your action is, some actions require more than one die to activate), racing (if you want to make it to Beijing first to grasp the 10 points) and variant player powers as each player represents a different historical character with a special ability.
Last pro on my list: game scales well with 2 or more players.

interesting dice worker placement game about trade and travel in the historic theme of Marco Polo's voyages

There's a lot going on: reaching traveling goals (especially Beijing), fulfilling trading contracts, establishing trading posts that also enable extra action spots or extra income, bonuses for being first in a city, characters with very different game-breaking abilities, dice worker placement with a few twists, extra camel actions to modify dice, getting temporary extra dice, ...

+ game idea with the historical theme tied in
+ asymmetric player powers in a great way(!)
+ board modifications for more variety (city cards, bonus tiles)
+ mechanics
+ great illustration and good materials (though big and small resource pieces are hard to distinguish)
- The name is a bit clunky and ambiguous.
- oddities of the map (e.g. missing important cities)
- a bit complicated (some rule details, hard to keep overview on the board)
- a bit expensive

Such a great game!!

Incredibly fun worker placement-- difficult to excel at, but not overly punishing. Less direct blocking thanks to the dice-stacking, but still plenty of meaningful considerations to be made thanks to your opponents' play. Filling contracts? Satisfying. Meeting goals? Satisfying. Travelling? Satisfying. The options for player characters really add some fun variability and a nice bit of theme. This is not a "thematic game," but it is a somewhat thematic game. Medieval travel and trade along the Silk Road is admittedly a historical guilty pleasure of mine-- but very few games have done it with such gusto. And smart, fair use of dice? This game was made for me.

We dived in the game with a fair amount of anticipation as we liked the designers previous game T'zolkin very much. We were looking forward to a brain burner with a similar depth. The looks of the game (excellent board, custom wooden pieces) and the travelling mechanic also appealed to us.

Unfortunately, we were not impressed. Probably, the dice make or ruin the game for everyone. For us, they were a really annoying mechanism. While there are several ways to modify them or get extra dice to your pool and there are certain catch-up mechanisms in case you were struck by bad luck, still, generally the higher numbers will correspond to more flexibility regarding what you can do. We also liked the fact that as you travel and explore the land you will have more opportunities to place your dice and there is a vast number of possibilities there. At the same time they make the game very unbalanced. There are spots where you can get double the money of your die which is a huge thing in a game where you usually struggle to get money for your expensive travels. In other cases you can generate a couple of victory points which won't change the results of the game much. The special powers should also spice things up, but depending on the journey you are encouraged to take they can be pretty useless in some cases.

The biggest issue with the Voyages of Marco Polo is that the ease of play is missing. On your turn depending on the results of your dice you are taking several extra actions to get money, modify the die roll, hope to get a better die, while there are only so much spaces where you can go and get the necessary resources. This is not an awful game by any means, but very disappointing and certainly not one we would seek out to play.

Mechanically this game doesn't do anything particularly special.  It's dice placement where you get resources and trade in resources for points.  But, it does have some crazy variable powers, which separates it from some of the other hundreds of worker placement games.

The game blends a number of well-known mechanics into a quite unique experience. Although, you might say it's random, because you roll dice every round, there is still much planning to do. The only thing is that in the whole decision making process, suddenly it is no more about following Marco Polo's footsteps around the globe and some might consider the game a bit dry.
As far as I'm concerned - a must have :)

A nifty worker-placement game where the workers are dice. With different starting player powers and a variety of location powers that can show up in different spots or not at all from game to game, The Voyages of Marco Polo presents changing tactical challenges and thus loads of replay value. Update: Growing concerns with this one. First, rolling high numbers is categorically better than rolling low numbers, and the cost (in camel expenditures) to mitigate bad rolls is so steep that anyone rolling poorly is double punished. There also seems to be a flaw in the number of black dice available. With four players, there are five black dice, meaning the start player will likely get two of the five. Assuming the start player plows the first die rolled into getting more camels each round, this person can dominate the camels, and thus the black dice (which cost camels) and remain start player almost indefinitely. Add to this the debatable utility of some of the special role powers vs. others and play balance begins to grow to a major issue in my mind. I guess more plays will tell, but I think this game may be interesting but flawed.

Having played the pro Variant right away, I'm thinking it might have been better to start with the suggested Setup as the roles seemed dysbalanced. Other than that it's a dice/worker placement Game. Solid, but nothing to get crazy about. Think microchanges to known mechanisms. It's almost as if Feld designed this, but was withdrawn from the project before he had a Chance to add a Point Salad.

RATING: 6
There's nothing really new here, but this is just such a great distillation of euro gameplay. You've got trading in the Mediterranean complete with silk, spices, and gold. So right off the bat it's like they're saying "we're not trying to hide anything, this is a euro game. Take it or leave it."

You've got a type of worker placement in the form of dice placement. You've got a sort of engine building by moving to different cities to get bonuses. And you've got a tight resource economy that consists of balancing your money, camels, and your three main resources. On top of that you've got crazy player powers that change the way you play the game each time. This is is a game all about dice rolling, but one guy doesn't have to roll his dice, he can just use whichever number he wants. This is a game about resource management, but one guy just gets free resources whenever somebody else takes resources. The powers all seem equally overpowered and really make the game tons of fun to play.

The use of dice is excellent here. I really didn't care for Alien Frontiers, I liked Troyes less and less each time I played it, and I thought Bora Bora was just okay. In those games you had a few ways to mitigate the dice, but the dice were frequently frustrating because you just didn't have the thing you needed. In Marco Polo low dice are almost as useful as higher-numbered dice, and there are also plenty of ways to mitigate your dice rolls. If your dice total less then 15, you get money and camels to make up the difference. You can also spend camels to re-roll or adjust your dice, and camels are the resource that is easiest to acquire. It's smart, it works, and unlike in other dice placement games you never feel like you got shafted because of a bad roll.

A few quick items of note: the replayability seems huge. There are (I think) six action spaces that are fixed on the game board, then you put out around 10 extra spaces each game from a deck of 31 cards. So you have a completely different set of actions each game.
The rules are clear and the game is very easy to teach because there are excellent player aids included for each player. Just explain a few things, then walk new players through the player aid.

Update: Having played a few times now, I there seems to be one small issue: the final round is often anticlimactic. Because most of the points in the game are public, there tends to be a runaway leader going into the final round (or even the final two rounds). It seems like this is because the person played better, though, so it doesn't necessarily mean there is a flaw with the game. It reminds me of Istanbul and Lewis and Clark in this area.

The issue is compounded by the lack of player interaction and the inability to completely block any important spaces. In a recent three-player game, for example, we knew by the end of round three that the first-place player was too far ahead to catch. The other two players couldn't do anything to stop him so they basically played for second place.

Sold.

The Euro that will have you saying "Damn I wish I had THAT power" as you point your finger across the table at Genghis Kahn's/Marco Polo's/Amerigo Vespucci's brother's portrait.

This game paves many paths to victory and you've probably tread them before.  But trust me when I say the asymmetry is a compelling enough gimmick, because just trying to figure out how to best exploit your unique ability is worth exploring in its own right.

I love the mechanics of this game, it plays super smooth and has a lot of polish to it.  The play time as a result is really great for the number of decisions, about 1 hour to a max of 90 mins.

I'd probably rate it an 8.5 but there is just something that sticks in my craw about the characters and character selection.  I just feel that board setup and character selection is too swingy.  I love the idea of the characters but some of them are just extremely weak without a certain board setup (namely Kublai, and less so Caprini/Wilhelm), while the others have pretty bullet proof passive abilities.

I feel like the only reason to ever take those characters is if there is some fantastic card draws in the far east (or easily accessible money for WvR), otherwise they are dogs in comparison to the others.

I've taken a few suicide runs with Kublai and feel I played pretty well (70-75ish final score) and was pretty well beat on by the likes of Berke or Matteo.

Marco Polo strikes me as a good - not great - mid-weight Euro. 

The components are high quality (though I question why the size of the items differ, and why this isn't mentioned anywhere in the rules) and the variable setup (and especially the player powers) ensure no two games are every quite the same.

The rules feel a bit burdensome for a game of its length and weight, however. Many "one off" exceptions that can be touch to remember. I'll give it additional plays and hope to warm up to it.

First Impression:

A euro with variable player powers and a completely unecessery central dice placement mechanism.

The Good: The theme carries through which is neat for a euro. The game is enganging and offers some serious and difficult choices and rewards both tactical and strategic play. The gameplay is tough, tight and thus rewarding when you manage to make some progress. The variable starting player powers is the correct way to go.

The Bad: The theme is still boring for me. The variable starting player powers seem wildly unbalanced, but I need more plays of course to verify that. The most extreme problem for me however is once again the wrong use of dice. I can accept the use of dice as simple crude randomisers in euros (say like in castles of burgundy), but I cannot tolerate them when they are a luck fest. Once again in this game, rolling high is clearly better than rolling low, and there are a ton of mechanisms added to the game to mitigate just that. That is a ton of complexity added to the game for no reason at all other than to make it complex and use the dice like this because I guess it's a fetish.

All in all I'm very dissapointed with Marco Polo. It's a game that could have been a clear, elegant, much simpler and much better if it didn't use a completely unecessery dice system. This is worse than a flawed design, this is a flawed design choice and it loses me almost completely.

What a perfect euro game! Lots of variation between games, awesome character powers, dice that are well integrated and not just a matter of luck, hits that perfect weight where both hardcore and semi-casual gamers can play. Looks beautiful! Holy smokes - those components are gorgeous! Amazing replay value! The theme is not the most interesting of all themes but it definitely makes sense in regards to what you are doing - marco polo was known for exploring and trading and that is exactly how you play and win this game. The board is a bit so-so but it gets the job done and is very descriptive. Intuitive rules and not too long not too short. Great stuff!

Not easy to earn money in order to do voyages,  it may needs more turns or more dices per player. The dices makes the game more attractive to the people that dont play eurogames, it's very very light game. The abilities of each player is not balanced, some of them are very strong and some others are very weak. You cannot build all your houses, and it is not worth it, because u will give all your money for voyages in order to take some v. points. This game is not balanced, only with the quests you can win.

I have been looking forward to playing this game quite a bit. I've tried it online, but it's often hard to get a feel for a game when you learn it online. So I was psyched to play it over the board.

The game is a five round game, where you're placing dice to take actions. Generally you can only trigger an action space once per round, and the pip value determines how well you do at that actions. However, if you take the action after another player you'll have to pay the pip value in coins to be able to take that action.

The game is largely about traveling to cities and fulfilling contracts. Traveling lets you do a number of things:

a) get a bonus if you're the first to visit a large city
b) get a bonus every round if you visit a small city
c) have the ability to use a large city special ability
d) place a trading post (there's points if you put out a bunch of them)
e) fulfill your travel goals (you have secret locations you want to visit)
f) get points if you visit Beijing

Much of the game is centered around getting resources to fulfill contracts, money to travel, and camels, which are used to travel, fill contract and also allow you to borrow special black dice for a round.

The game is highly asymmetric with every player having a different special ability. I've heard some rumblings about whether the game is balanced or not because of this, but obviously it's hard for me to have an opinion after a single play. We did have some expansion bits in our game, and I suspect that one of the expansion player powers was unbalanced.

I like this game a lot and hope to play more.

[thing=171623][/thing] is a game of, well, many things. It has dice placement - everyone rolls 5 dice and use them to do the actions in the game. It has route building, as all players receive, in the beginning, two trade routes to connect - by reaching the named cities, you will score points in the end game. It has contracts, which require resources to be fulfilled and, when done, earn the player with points and, maybe, other stuff. It has variable player powers, as every player starts with a character (like Matteo Polo, Johannes Carpini, Berke Khan, and others), which provides an unique ability for the use of the player.

[thing=171623][/thing] borrows a lot from other games and mechanics in order to build an unique whole. And it all worked pretty darn well.

Though higher numbers on dice usually means better actions, and thus rolling (and luck) become an important "skill" in games with dice rolling, [thing=171623][/thing] uses this in smart ways: first, if the combine number of the 5 dice is bellow 15, the player can gain camels or money in a 1:1 basis. Also, in some actions, having a lower number is much preferable - travelling and gaining money are the two most common, but also might apply to the take a contract action. I played with 4 and with 3, and no one playing felt the numbers on the dice determined the outcome of the game, nor when rolling low they don't have what to do in the round. This is pretty great for a dice placement game.

[thing=171623][/thing] seems to have a huge amount of replay value. There are different characters, different routes to build, and the abilities to be used in the cities are randomly set at the start of each game, and there are loads of different abilities. I'm hard pressed to find a game with such a big replay value right out of the box.

The art and graphics are well done (not awesome, but pleasant and fine all around) and do their job. Rarely we had to look for the meaning of the icons on a card. The game is truly language independent.

Downtime, even with 4, wasn't truly an issue, since the player do only one action and passes the turn for the next player. But if a player went for gold (using three dice) than, say, travel (two dice) is possible that she stays out of the round while others still have a lot of actions to do (not only with the 5 normal dice, but also with the black dice, which can be bought). However, this is a choice of the player, and even still, a round will be completely over in around 10 minutes after that.

Strategy is mainly for travel, as it is very important to set goals to where to go and how soon, since arriving first in the big cities give the player a one time bonus, and if it is in Beijing, it will be worth more points the sooner a player gets there (first gain 10 points, second 7, third 4 and fourth 1). Also, in the small cities, players will start to receive, every turn, the benefit from the place, which are usually very good to have. You can also plan for contracts, even though new ones open up every round, there are only 4 resources in the game (gold, silk, pepper and camels), so by having some of them, you will probably be close to made one or more contracts, no matter which ones will open. Overall, smart planning, and knowing when to spend resources (mainly camels) to get more actions (buying a black die) or to change the value of a die, are key to do well in the game, way more than roll high.

There isn't much confrontation in the game - basically is the well known "taking what someone else wants". But even in this [thing=171623][/thing] is light, as for the basic actions (not the ones taken in cities), everyone can use an action already taken, but will have to pay an amount of money equal to the number of the die (or the higher die when using more than one). Though it happened during my plays, for most of the time, no one will have "serious" hard feelings against someone else.

And what about theme? The dreaded downfall of several fine euro games. Well, it isn't the main thing in the game, but it is there. You get resources, you fulfill contracts, you travel, you make trading routes. Travel by sea is costly, and going long distances uses lots of camels. Kublai Khan starts in Bejing, Wilhelm goes evangelizing, Matteo has connections for business, and so on. These make sense. Voyages isn't a thematic game, no, but it works in the level it wants to.

I found [thing=171623][/thing] to be highly enjoyable, easy to play (at least for those used to lots of euros), with little downtime and lots of room for nice plays. This is probably the best low-confrontation euro I got to know this year (with high confrontation, [thing=30645][/thing] is still higher, however, I don't have any doubt about which of them will get way, way more plays one year from now). Highly recommended.

This is really balanced and tight eurogame.

There are multiple ways to victory, and it's very hard to achieve as much as you want in the limited amount of turns available.  

The variable characters make the game different for each player, with their tactics varying wildly.

But, even when you think someone has ran away with it, you discover that it was actually far closer than you thought.

A great and wonderfully fun game; I think this will be bumped up to a 10 very soon!

Pros: different player powers, variable board setup, contracts that provide rewards and excellent components.

Cons: different player powers, economy seems tight, moving on the board vs fulfilling contracts.

I get why people like this game, lots of tough interesting decisions. It is a very limiting game. Resources can be tight and options for placing workers can be tight too. I'm still having a hard time balancing the travel vs completing contracts. 
The variable board actions are interesting but I don't see them being used much. Most of the games I've played I've only seen one or two board actions being used during the game which seems a waste to me. There are 9 spots to unlock via traveling. I think coming up with better cards for these places might help.
I think some people love the restrictions in this game. I don't. I think this game is ok but not really that fun for me.

First impressions:
I am 3 years late for playing this hyped-up SDJ nominee. Was it worth the wait? 
Perhaps. The jury remains out there.

For a 4p game, I felt that VoMP had low rules maintenance. It is a very straight forward,  resource conversion and worker placement Euro using Dice as payment.
Compared to Rajas of the Ganges, another dice placement game, VoMP is less fiddly and more intuitive. The action selection with dice is also a bit more restrictive and there are fewer options on the board. Don't let that fool you though, the game play itself is tight and the variable elements in the game are quite tremendous. We all collectively noted that while certain actions may feel "samey", there are many variable characters, city rewards, contracts and bonuses in the game making it tough to master unless you play the game a lot. Some can see that as a strength, others, a weakness.

A few additional observations: One, the character powers are insane, but feels relatively well-balanced. We all collectively gasped at the powers but enjoyed playing the game with the powers. Without playing these characters, the game would lose a lot of flavor and be relatively bland. Two, traveling is not as easy as it looks. Money is tight, the travel slot can be highly contested and the cities are scattered. This makes traveling TOUGH. It may look like the distance is not insurmountable, but believe me, you won't be moving too much in 5 rounds. 
Three, you need to take advantage of your character power and also find a niche in the game you can exploit because no one else is doing it. That goes without saying for many games, but especially true for VoMP. Fighting for the same resources is suicidal.

After one play, I like but not love the game. It is a game I will gladly play but probably not ask for it often and probably won't be high on my list of immediate replays. Tzolkin is a much better and more unique design.

Admito que joguei esse jogo a primeira vez ainda com um certo preconceito. Participo com uma certa frequência de um evento semanal e, nesse evento, o ranking sempre o colocava no TOP 5, as vezes TOP 3, e eu me perguntava como um jogo de dados relativamente recente poderia ser tão bom a ponto de rivalizar com clássicos como Terra Mystica, Agricola e Power Grid e até mesmo maravilhas recentes, como Mombasa, Caledonia e GWT, todos sem a "cruz" do fator sorte que os dados sempre carregam.
Então, jogar Marco Polo me respondeu plenamente o fascínio que ele exerce em alguns. Eita jogo bom! Apesar dos dados, as mecânicas são tão bem feitas que sua sorte é bastante mitigada. Pelo contrário, os dados dão um charme ao jogo, tanto que, dos personagens q conheci, o que me dá menos vontade de jogar é justamente aquele q não joga os dados, apenas coloca os números de sua escolha. Acredito que isso tire bastante do desafio e exercício mental (q, em essência, pra mim são, afinal, duas das grandes diversões de se jogar board games) de otimizar as ações com base nos valores que saíram.
E por falar em personagens... Que personagens! Muitos dirão que alguns são muito roubados, mas está justamente aí o trunfo do jogo: TODOS ELES são roubados! Isso fornece um equilíbrio maravilhoso (levando em conta que conheci apenas os 4 personagens iniciais). Ao contrário de, por exemplo, Terra Mystica, onde os poderes das raças só aparecem em situações específicas ao longo do jogo, ou Small World, onde, dependendo da partida, uma mesma raça pode ser muito poderosa ou muito ruim, ou até mesmo Colt Express, onde personagens são nitidamente muito mais poderosos que outros qq q seja a situação (sorry pelo exemplo meia boca, não tenho tantos jogos de poderes variáveis assim), em Marco Polo, os poderes são todos ótimos e podem ser usados potencialmente em todos os turnos (mais uma vez, conheci apenas com os 4 personagens do setup básico, sei que existem outros que variam bastante, inclusive quero conhecê-los).
Por fim, as possibilidades estratégicas são ótimas e a variedade é bem presente, com as cartas e contratos dos mais diversos, dando uma rejogabilidade fora do comum. Não está isento de problemas, ouvi dizer que as vezes é possível ganhar sem fazer uma viagem sequer. Os tokens grandes tb são ruins, com pouca diferença para os pequenos, oq confunde os jogadores. Mas no mínimo já entra no meu top 20 e com certeza quero jogá-lo de novo, com outros personagens e acredito q tem qualidades para me ganhar mais ainda e se consolidar no meu top 10 ou até, quem sabe, top 5.

This game irritates me.  That surprised me as I expected to like the game after reading several reviews. The resource collecting for making contracts is shallow and boring. Scoring on the map is harder, but not in an interesting way. 

I very much like dice used as resources in games like Troyes and Signorie. However, in this game, the dice are workers of pip-strength, and can be placed anywhere (provided you have money if you are not first). OK, money is scarce and causes problems, but once again, I did not find dealing with the money shortage interesting. Overall, a big disappointment.

I was very turned off to this game after demo-ing it at Origins in 2015. Then I played a friends copy and fell in love. The characters are very, very asymmetric which can feel a little odd the first couple plays, but it really makes for some interesting decision and forces you to play a little differently each game. Each round is a unique optimization puzzle. This has quickly become one of my favorites.

A very neat and attractive game... but it failed to wow me in my first play.  Maybe I had hyped it up too much in my head.  As a fan of dice-placement games, this didn't feel too different to me, more of a game of resource trading with too few turns to really feel like you accomplished something.  I liked it enough but it didn't stand out to me.

if you like euros, you're probably going to like this.  It plays like butter, and like many of the best euros, I can't tell if the game is new or old.  Feels like both.

It has some depth, but isn't complex really.  I thought it was pretty easy to learn and teach.  With all the variable character powers and setup, I think it has lots of plays in it.

great game.

A good surprise, having not liked Tzolkin by the same authors, I expected a dry mechanical euro game with tons of interchangeable resources, but it's actually a dry mechanical euro game with tons of interchangeable resources that works well ;)

[+] the dice allocation works well (having to pay for an already taken spot), the resource/travel management is tight, the characters all seem overpowered to begin with but it creates a good asymetry (also good for replayability)
[-] tons of interchangeable resources; the contracts dont make much sense; some combinations of city-goals might be impossible due to limited supply of outposts. point-saladish.

Interesting dice-as-worker-placement game, yet another entry in the heavy Euros that seem to dominate the hobby game scene nowadays.  The theme here is better than in most, as there's a travel and a trading goods aspect that feels right, though there are still places where the theme is very grafted on.  The variable player powers here are a great touch, one that with this game and [gameid=120677], Euros seem to finally be willing to embrace in a way that's more than a minor tweak.  The mechanics of this game are not especially unique, but they are solid, and I expect this one will stick around for at least a little while.

"Terra Mystica lite" is a pretty apt description of Marco Polo, as you formulate a strategy at the outset based on the random setup of the board and the character you choose. There isn't as much spatial interaction as in TM, but there is an interesting traveling salesman problem to solve (unique every time based on the setup). The game also has a fair amount of turn angst from the dice placement mechanism: while you often aren't entirely shut out from taking an action if someone else takes it, you do have to pay a penalty that could be very costly to your efficiency. Overall I really like it- the inter-game variability is pretty high which keeps things relatively fresh. This delivers quite strongly for a medium-weight, 90 minute game. Perhaps best with 3 just cause itt'l take less time than with 4.

The absolute best aspect of this is game is the varying player powers. As many have stated, they all seem overpowered.

This is really a game that has taken me by surprise! When I bought it, I was expecting a good solid game – but I was not prepared such extraordinary and excellent qualities! The game mechanisms are fairly straight forward – easy to learn and teach. But what makes this game rise to star status, is the clever use of dice-placement and the unique character options. Every time I play the game, it is almost like a completely new game with new options and strategies – great game with great replay value!

Have no idea what the fuss is about. It really is just gather resources and generate points. The whole point pretends to be about travelling to China, the game is called Marco Polo after all. However, in reality, that's not really needed and you just need to concentrate on the contracts, as that is where the points are. Played a second time, is indeed a pile of camel poo.

An extremely clean euro without "gamey" or "fiddly" mechanics. The game is very transparent because all relevant information is open and there are no convoluted scoring systems (e.g. Terra Mystica). The impact of your decisions is straightforward to see, which allows you to purely focus on strategic planning  as opposed to information gathering.

The game is easy to learn but extremely unfriendly to beginners, because some of the most important decisions (bonus cards, character draft, and travel route planning) must be made in the first few turns of play.

All whom I have played this with felt that travel was not worth it and difficult to pull off. I so wanted to love this game, but it just feels contrived. Maybe with adjusted expectations that some of the random setups means that travel barely works unless you get the special power guy. (which, I can't stand variable player powers determining my strategy). Maybe if contracts took 2 dice to get and travel only took 1, we would like it better. But I dislike having to house rule a game to make it interesting.

At first it sounds terribly complicated but after the first of the five turns everything is clear and runs smoothly. Still, it has a lot of fine details in it and you first have to learn a lot of little things/powers/rewards/effects and so on: too many for my tastes.
The best thing is that different characters are so "exagerated" in their powers that they really make a difference and this concept is the best part of the game and, as far as i know, quite original. As far as the rest of the game is concerned, it doesnt shine for originality but the mechanism is extremely well oiled and works very well.
The game lasts only 5 turns and i felt like i needed so many more and i thought "is it already over??" and this is a good sign as i really wanted to play it for some more time to tie the loose ends.
I want to play it more and probably the rating will go up.

[EDIT]: after several plays on Yucata.de I am appreciating this a lot more. Just a few short turns and the game is always different, a few ultra-tough decisions... I like it a lot now. +0.6 rating to 8.

Mechanically it's all familiar territory. Action selection through dice selection. Order fulfillment. Characters with special powers. Everything operates smoothly to the point of being the perfect ride. It provides plenty of teeth gritting moments. The characters powers are rule breaking or game breaking to a point that seems almost ridiculous yet believable in the sense that every player openly envies what another can pull off. Each player gets a bonkers ability so ultimately it all works in unison. A rock solid journey through a popular theme. No other tabletop experience lets you store up camels in your warehouse. Marco Polo would be proud to put his name to this title.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I held off on this one as no one seemed to be covering it and that's typically a clue that it's not worth playing. However, Tom Vasel reviewed it and my co-worker was telling me about it as well, so I gave it a shot.

In [b]The Voyages of Marco Polo[/b] you're tasked with earning victory points by acquiring goods and money and fulfilling contracts. In that way, it's almost like playing [b]Lords of Waterdeep[/b]. However, you also need to move across Asia in order to go to different towns to setup your trade routes and acquire goods. 

The way you'll be doing all of this is by rolling dice and then placing them on the available actions: gain money, gain trade goods, travel, take contracts, take a good and some camels. You'll be placing one or more dice on these actions and then taking what you're owed. These dice determine the "strength" of your selected action, typically allowing you to gain more or do more of something, with the lowest die determining how much. In addition, most spaces can be used by multiple players if they pay money equal to the lowest die being placed, so you're never completely shut off from the various actions you may need.

Finally, each player has a role card that "breaks" the game in some interesting way. I say "breaks" because they all seem broken in their own unique way: not having to roll dice, getting another die and contract each turn, starting at the end position on the map, traveling easier, and so on. Without these, the game would be fine, but with these it really kicks it up a notch. Asymmetry always makes me appreciate a game just that much more.

This is definitely a game I recommend playing and picking up if any of the above sounds interesting to you. If you're interested in theme, I feel like this game does a pretty good job of giving you a theme, even if it's a little thin when looking at the actions.

RATING: 8.9
Tremendous game in terms of mechanics, art work/display, theme, decision making and satisfaction at the end of the game.  Love the asymmetric starting powers!  This helps decide the individual strategies.  Another bonus is the relative quick play-time. While I appreciate the quick playing time (hits the table more often), it kind of ends abruptly, which is good and bad.  The decision making and planning in the last two rounds certainly contributes to the wonderful strain to squeeze out every last point.  One of my favourite games.  A step up from Stone age and TTR, and a slice below the heavy-weight games like Terra Mystica and Yedo (which are both excellent games too).

The game might look a bit complicated at first, but really isn't. It plays pretty fast with experienced gamers, even if they haven't played it before. I wish the game would go on for a couple more rounds, because it's over before you know it. You really have to focus on one particular strategy which is mostly determined by the character you choose at the beginning of the game. If you don't use the strengths of your character, you won't win in Marco Polo.

After the first play it left me feeling disappointed. Perhaps I was hoping for too much because of all the hype around the game, but still the fact remains that the game leaves you feeling like you didn't get enough time to accomplish what you wanted (some goals are impossible to achieve other than with certain characters and while neglecting other goals).

However, there is something in this game that makes me want to play it more (perhaps the actual toughness of some goals). Also, I think the game will yield you a lot of plays because of the huge variety in the setup and different characters to play. So, overall I am glad to own it and I think it's a very good game in the end.

For 1-2 testing plays with friends - not recommended
For owning and playing it dozens of time - highly recommended

It reminds me of Stone Age for some reason, though Stone Age is way more elegant (both graphically and mechanically), is more streamlined and brings way bigger satisfaction (you can score 300-something points, whereas in Marco Polo you can end up having 30-something points).
I think I prefer Stone Age in general, but I believe this game offers higher replayability. So in the end, both games end up with the same score.

First of all, that name?? Some publishers don't consider that simple names are letting people to share their impressions easier and to find information on the internet. By the way, the biggest problem with this game is exactly that "travel" part. Because the game is too short and you have to do lots of things in it to collect enough points, so the traveling part is very limited and leaves you with a bad taste in your mouth. I've played 3-4 games of it. In one of them i've tried to concentrate on traveling and still wasn't able to fulfill both of my travel tasks. On the other hand i've collected very few points in other parts of the game. In other sessions i wasn't thinking about traveling at all and concentrated on fulfilling the orders. True, i still didn't won, so maybe one has to keep a balance and try to do everything. But when you are not able to complete just one traveling task, it is not allowing to get full satisfaction from a game. And the other parts (action selection, orders fulfillment) are fun. That's why it gets a higher rating. But every session i've played felt too short.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Theme/Art:
The art is not outstanding, but the game looks good and I really enjoy the theme. The game board and the general design of the game are very good and clear.

Production quality:
Thick cardboard for all tiles, wooden pieces for the resources, and pretty big wooden dice for your workers. So the very good. I love that the money has different shapes and sizes for  each amount and it's not only round coins.

Replayability:
Very high. There are 8 characters with different abilities (all sound very strong, but if every character is strong, none is), many different action spaces for the big cities, which are assigned randomly, many different missions and orders for the players, so each game is different. Only the small town bonuses are the same each game.

Depth/Difficulty:
It's not the easiest game, but not the hardest either. I think I can explain it in about 10 to 15 minutes to new players. The game is quite deep, especially because you only have 5 rounds to reach all your goals and complete all missions. It is not a very long game, but you have to think ahead a lot. If you are the first to take an action space you may get money from others using the space later in the same round, but you may have to pay others on other spots.
I weight it 3/5.

Strategy:
This game is all about strategy. From the selection of your character, over the selection of your missions and the route you travel to the actions you take each turn, everything affects your performance in this game.

Luck:
Even though you roll dice as your workers there is no such thing as a bad dice roll (well, there is, if you only roll low or only high it can be bad). Low dice don't give you high rewards on action spaces, but you have to pay your opponents less for using the action space.
The setup is random and the orders for each round are random too, but visible once laid out. I would say that the game has low luck.

The Voyages of Marco Polo takes about 20-25 minutes per player, so the information on the box is correct.

I enjoyed the game very much and so did everybody I played it with. It's deep and strategic, yet you don't have to commit your whole evening to playing it.

Pretty impressed with this one. Even though it's largely a Euro, there are plenty of ways to mitigate dice RNG. It seems to mash up great features of several games and add its own flair to create something very good. There's a ton of variety in city cards, characters, goals, and contracts so games should largely play differently. Really looking to dive into this one. Components are very nice, although the 'larger' meeples are barely discernible.

This is a game that came out of nowhere for me. There was a bit of buzz about it on the geek so I decided to check it out. The more I read about it, the more that I really wanted it.

Having only played it twice so far... I'm happy that I jumped on the chance to grab it... minor mistakes in the first printing and all. 

It is like the designers built a game based on all of the mechanisms that I love. You roll dice at the beginning of each round, similar to Castles of Burgundy, and that determines the type of actions/resources/etc. that you can get each turn. These dice can be manipulated as well. You have resource conversion and contract fulfillment. There's an exploration/travelling aspect that opens more options for you throughout the game and/or gives you benefits each round... and end game points if you complete your secret objective cards. These mechanics on their own would have combined to make an interesting game but layer on top of that the variable character powers that all seem to be overpowered in their own right and break the rules of the game and it's AWESOME!

Every turn has you agonize over what you should be doing to maximize your return. The fact that other players can jack the spot you wanted, making it more expensive for you to take that action or completely block it off from you at all, necessitates that you keep strategic options open. You also need to understand what your player's strengths are and how to benefit from them... just so many moving parts, so many options, so many strategies... I can't say enough about it.

With so many variables to the game's setup, replayability is through the roof. The fact that we played a 4-player "learning game" in about 2 hours is amazing. Can't say enough about this game.

This is quite a well designed game!  I love how the game requires that you analyze the board ahead of time.  I hate how the game requires you to analyze the board ahead of time!  It's a love hate relationship with that aspect of the game because if you don't analyze the board before you choose characters, you could set yourself up for failure.  This could draw players away from the incredible gameplay.  The dice allocation system is really clever and tense.  The spaces on the board are limited and it's first come, first served unless you are willing to pay more.  I think its absolutely brilliant how the designer was able to create individual player power characters that feel incredibly strong and satisfying.  You will feel like your opponents power is SO strong and they will fell the same about yours. Its nice that there are multiple paths to scoring points (contracts, travel, board spaces that give points).  A real gem of a game and I can't see myself selling this for a long time!

Really intricate game. The dice placement is a nice twist on the usual worker placement and it is good for the flow of gameplay that you can not be blocked out of the placement-spots. The different actions work together nicely, so even if you have a bad dice-roll you can always find tactics to work with that, not having to find a whole new strategy.
So there are no bad rolls because you always can find away to work towards your strategy.
Excellent work, love this game!

I like the dice placement mechanism and the asymmetric player powers are shockingly powerful. Also inspired me to learn some interesting history about Marco Polo et al.

There's something about the blend of mechanisms in this game that I find really interesting. I am  generally terrible at this (winning 1 out of 6) and I enjoy not getting how to do well - something to keep me interested as I continually flounder in my failure to read the board correctly!

A bad version of Stone Age, with more replayability due to setup but less depth. 
Only one way to score points and achieve victory. Tzolkien, Crisis are infinitely more complete games compared to this one.

Played this one two consecutive times today, just my wife and myself.

Already I rated it up to "7" and we are sure it's going to be higher on our "house scale".

It's a very nice euro with easy rules and a lot of possibilities during play.

This is a solid, interesting take on worker placement with dice.  I really like being able to stack dice on most places as the cost of stacking still leads to a feeling of limiting decisions when other people "take your space."  Adding more options through travel works well and the various scoring bonuses are fun to balance too.

As much as I like the basic structure of the game I'm not sure about those special powers yet.  They really make the game stand out and are fun to focus your strategy with... but I do wonder how balanced they really are.  I'm certainly looking forward to playing more games to find out!

I really liked it and enjoyed playing it. Comparisons to Kingsburg/Alien Frontiers are expected. But honestly I enjoyed it more than both of them.  I always AF was a race game in disguise and KB just didn't click for me.

I liked this game because its got enough weight, money is tight, the missions/contract system is easy and a reminder of Lords of Waterdeep.  The leader powers are a bit silly.  I think there is a lot of replayability in this too.

The character you choose determines your play style. The character abilities are what separates this game from other euros.

I had high expectations for this on the basis that I love dice worker placement but it fell flat after the very first play. Board movement is just so difficult and there's a feeling of wanting to do more but you can't. It may be designed that way to create tough choices, but it felt a too frustrating for me. My wife really didn't enjoy it to the extent that we both knew after our second game it had to go - it didn't even make our usual 3 plays.

I thought it was a good euro, possibly great.  Need to play more.  I like how as symmetrical the powers are, I have concerns how balanced everything is, especially the city bonuses but also the player powers.  One gave a free dice and contract every turn which seemed broken.

I do want to play again and thought it was fun.

Egynek jó euró, ha azoknak az elkötelezett híve vagy, akkor kötelező is, de nem tud kiemelkedni a középszerűségből. Ettől függetlenül bármikor szívesen játszom vele, nem volt rossz és tetszett a látvány is, valamint igényesek a komponensek. Kellemes 1,5-2 óra, ami a karakterkártyáknak hála megfelelő újrajátszást is biztosít. Emiatt kicsit fel is pontozom.

Extraordinary euro - a good chunk of theme, lots of options (but not too many mechanisms as Mombasa), very "tactile" and good looking. Maybe not the first of its kind with the idea "variable powers come to euros", but did it very well. Maybe even better than Village with Inn, but for emotional reasons I still rate Village a 10.

After some thought and plays - the best modern euro in existence (with TTA not being a "euro"). And its very indicative that the best modern euro is by no means particularly innovative but a splendid hybrid - very postmodern one could say. What is even more fascinating is that I HATED Grand Austria Hotel from same designers...

Ok oggi 23/10/2016 finalmente dopo diversi mesi dall'acquisto, defustellato ed intavolato. Non ho giocato ma ho appreso le regole. In attesa di future partite, sembra molto interessante. Da provare con il gruppo.

Finalmente in un sabato sera, 5/11 abbiamo giocato in tre dopo un ora di lettura regolamento alla fine fa tanta paura ma è godibilissimo e scorrevole. Qualche limatura ancora al regolamento che ormai abbiamo fattio nostro.

Gioco promosso a pieni voti. Lo giocheremo ancora.

Bought it because it was one of the most enjoyable lightweight-medium games I ever played. The setup has a lot of variability and there's different player powers. The gameflow is smooth easy to get into. But there certainly is some good tactical-strategical play. No real negatives or flaws I can think of.

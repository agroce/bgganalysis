Feels a lot like a trading card game, but using minis instead of cards. Because of that it can be hard to store them, but still. Solid game. Would have rated higher if it weren't out of print.

RATING: 7
A very cool game.  If you replaced the miniatures with counters, you would lose a lot.  Don't get me wrong, it's challenging and fun in its own way, but the very best part of the game is the miniatures.  This makes the game far too expensive and space-consuming to ever be a part of my collection, but I'll play others' copies.

As far as game play, there is a lot of depth in assembling your army of creatures.  The game can be won or lost right there.  Then you have to manage the swings in fortune/misfortune, and then coordinate your attacks and strategy, so there is a lot to this game, but still, the miniatures make this game.

Beautiful figures - the best in the CMG market so far, but not as good as those painted by a figures painter. Good rules, balanced game, loads of decisions, and fairly quick. I shall get into this. Charles beat me on the first game. The board is a folded paper sheet - get the vinyl roll-up mat if you like this.

When [i]Navia Dratp[/i] died, I expected this game to take it's place. Then I realize that the dice accentuated, not diminished, the randomness from the boosters. While ND had random boosters, it was easy to get a whole set and the game itself had no random elements.

Long story short: I played [i]Navia Dratp[/i]. [i]Navia Dratp[/i] was my game. [i]Dreamblade[/i] is no [i]Navia Dratp[/i].

This is one of my all-time favorite board games with really cool mini's. Half the fun of the game is building your "warband", the other is seeing it live up to its potential in battle. Plenty of strategy/tactics and lots of fun if you like territorial conflicts.

Some deceptive strategy involved in this one.  Generally the figures are well done as well, and the game play is deep and interesting.

Update: Now that some time has gone by and a few expansions have come out my opinion has changed.  The game has become entirely a meta-game with each set breaking previous sets.  I had hoped Wizards had learned something with Magic, but obviously not.  I'm done with this.

I normally shy away from miniature games due to all the measuring and gobs and gobs of rules and modifiers, but this was very easy to learn and play, yet deep enough that I can see a lot fo replay value.  I played in the release tourney at GenComn and evedn though I didn't do that well, I had fun and learned a lot about the game and different strategies in the process.

RATING: 7
despite the large rule book, it's shockingly simple to play and teach.  the depth really lies in the army building.  there are plenty of decisions to be made in the game though: turn-ahead planning, risk mitigation, determining whether to disrupt or kill a creature, etc.  high quality minis, high quality rulebook.  we'll see how much i get into it.  with some regular opponents, i could see it happening.  it's kind of funny to think that wotc's own product could materially harm both heroscape and a&a minis though.  set 1 was dominated by movement abilities like the warcharm.  i'm pretty much out of the game with the release of baxar's war because of stuff like the merry-go-round guy.  i think they're making far too many movement abilities that are AP generators.  i think i might keep playing with commons/uncommons though.

played once with the starter.  It was fun, but the dice seem too random--marked with a 1,2,3,D,-,-, you have a 50/50 chance of not rolling any damager per dice.

I also deducted 1 pt for being collectable.  Actually the only reason I have this is because it "got cancelled," so I could go out and get some starters and boosters cheap.

A game I'd past over, given the collectable nature. Got it on discount, and discovered it's great - I need to play it more, I like limited format - don't have enough time or figures to consider constructed, just need to work out a system to play 'limited' with what I have. Probably end up playing draft (in a similar way I usually play Navia Drapt).

RATING: N/A
I tried this game a few times when it was out, and found the dice much too swingy: an average value of 1, but half the time you get 0 and sometimes you get a 3. I might have been able to live with that, but the game was also being marketed to a specific niche: competitive collectible gamers. I didn't have much interest in dealing with either the expense or the players I was seeing show up at tournaments, so I didn't buy into the game when it started. After it "died", I picked up some pieces on eBay, but few people are interested in playing "dead" games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Good game.  I like the innovative idea and the fact that the figures have all of their information directly on them so you don't need seperate data cards.  Easy to learn and fun to play.  We actually had a seven year-old holding his own in the tournament I just played in. (Dec '06)

RATING: 6.5
Very nice pre-painted minis and an interesting emough premise - but rather spolied for me because the fantastic creatures of dream and nightmare are corraled into such a limited range of moves.  The end effect is an pretty abstract game which isn't much to my taste.  The range of powers and their interaction is interesting but, as a game, I think it suffers from the usual problems in being 'collectable' - the drive towards the rare and powerful and the most obscure of combos.  For others though I know that is the attraction.  Good luck to them.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Wonderful game -- easily one of the finest collectible games produced to date. Dreamblade has surprising depth to its gameplay, offering a decent mix of combat and maneuver elements. What would at first glance seem like a collection (pardon the pun) of obvious choices quickly evolves into an "A-ha! I see what I should have done differently!" series of moments. The game is getting better with each subsequent playing -- a good sign. 

The pre-painted figures are quite well done considering their mass-production and include some interesting sculpts. 

The rules are clear and concise -- we have so far found the answers to our questions within the rulebook with a minimum of fuss.

The collectibility aspect of the game is a definite turn-off and is really the only reason this game won't get a higher rating from me.

I bought a bunch of this when it was discontinued and going cheap. The people I have played it with have liked it more than me. The collectable aspect brings variety but a lot of the abilities feel a bit vanilla. You've seen them all before if you've played other CCGs/LCGs. Collectable also makes it hard to build balanced armies. The area control aspect is cool as it can often be more important to move to scoring spaces than to fight. I find it hard to get over the feeling that I would rather be playing [thing=4741][/thing], [thing=139747][/thing] or [thing=58281][/thing].

RATING: 6
Intriguing game with varied ways to win.  Seems like you can have a swarm tactic or maybe have some stronger guys and attempt to repel the hordes.  Better than I expected.  Still, I just don't know about the collectible aspect.  I swore much of that off a long time ago and it's tough to want to spend lots of money on a pretty good game, when I can spend far less money on a pretty good game.  If the figures worked well with some RPG I was running, it would be much more attractive, but they don't seem particularly well suited to any of them.  Still, this could be a hit.  Have to see what the collectible market will bear.  Gameplay sits at an eight, but the game itself may get knocked to a seven or six for being collectible.

This is the best CMG ever published, hand down.  Don't be decieved- this isn't a reiteration of the childish Shogi-goes-Pokemon idea that was Navia Dratp, nor is it really a miniatures game at all beyond the figures (would could just as well be cardboard chits).  This is a strategic, area control boardgame with collectible pieces.  Yeah, really.  It has more in common with Ursuppe than Warhammer.  Players spawn various Clive Barker-style monsters and entities and duke it out for control of scoring cells in a game that appears to have been insanely playtested- it's the kind of game where you are weighing your options and you can see why certain design elements are in place.  It's easy to pick up and play mechanically but there always seems to be some really tough choices and strategic decisions that, again, are much more in line with board games than miniatures.  The combat system is fast, fun, and furious and offers some neat surprises thanks to some very well-thought out special abilities.  In all, I think it's a much better game than Heroscape and it should appeal to the same crowd and indeed it would make a fine step up from that simpler, less subtle game.  The miniatures are really top-notch, featuring some pretty interesting and surreal creatures.  No, I don't support the collectible concept and I think that's the game's weakest element- if Wizards had released this as an expandable game rather than giving into industry pressure to produce yet another collectible game in search of the "next" phenomenon to appease retailers, it could have been something really significant.  There is also an overall sense of awkwardness to it though- it's too dark for kids, yet most adults don't go nuts for collectibles.  The theme isn't familiar at all, sort of a quasi-dark fantasy/horror/science fiction thing that covers all the bases so to speak.  Most board gamers will stay away from it with their usual objections to collectible games and miniatures in general and most miniatures gamers won't care for the board game element.  It's an odd product, but as such it's also one of the most original games I've played this year and I think that even if it doesn't take off in the marketplace, it's going to be a cult hit for sure.  I say instead of spending $100 on three Euros that have the same worn-out mechanics and themes as the last three you bought you buy $100 of Dreamblade instead- there's a lot more variability, variety, and fun there than in any number of wooden cubes and auctions.  Great, great game, I'm glad I gave it a chance rather than just dismissing it based on its distribution.

EDIT- after playing regularly for over a month, I can no longer resist upping the rating.  Dreamblade is officially a favorite- an absolute 10 on every level.

RATING: 9
Collectible miniatures game that plays just fine and fun without ever having to collect. It's Magic the Gathering expressed on a game board with area-control strategy. Like Magic, it has some luck -- Magic has the flaw of the "bad draw," while Dreamblade has the flaw of "you keep rolling better combat rolls than I do." But these games are extremely fun, with a lot of rich variety, which I crave in my gaming experiences. The Dreamblade universe continues to expand, and I'm sure some people are collecting and trading their figures, and I'm sure there are fan sites that purport to have the "killer warband." But I don't feel like I have to keep up with any of that to have a great time playing Dreamblade with my family or friends. Two-player fun for 30 minutes.

I hate the addictive nature of collectible games and love the endless combination that it provides.  If Wizards of the Coast would've continued to support this game in a reasonable way.  IE not releasing expansions  2 a year making it all but impossible to keep up with the constant changes of the game, it may have kept from creating overpowered combinations, this game is great and I would recommend picking up cheap boosters if you like models and fun.

Secretly an area control Euro, although with a bit of dice.  An awesome example of adding a great layer of play on top of a deck building engine.  Gets to be an 8 since you can print out 3 of every guy and play for free.  Blind collectible games themselves can't be higher than a 3.

The collectibility is annoying, but this is the best WotC product since M:TG, and this also happens to be the best CMG on the market.   Which is ironic, since it really plays more like a CCG with some area control elements.  It plays very fast and there is a lot of difficult choices going on, especially for the first player each round.  Strike or shift?   What will my opponent do?  Disrupt? Or destroy and risk deathblow?   The miniatures are huge and incredibly well done.  An easy game to learn, too, which is a nice plus.  Current collection is around 220 figs.

I want to rate this higher due to having good game mechanisms.  It was nice to play a mini's game that had a chess-like grid and didn't have a buy your army/make your own play area.  Unfortunately, I think I played with units of a faction I didn't enjoy and it really sucked the fun out of the few play sessions I had.  I dislike the dice and think they could have removed them for a different mechanism.  Unfortunately, due to the collectible nature of the game I won't get to explore it any more to see if there is something to enjoy.  I don't dislike collectible games, but I do dislike the financial burdens they carry.

Just re-discovered this gem of a game.  Even ordered a coupe of boosters, and have been really enjoying getting back into it -- playing a Valor/Passions warband (me) against a Madness/Fear one (opponent -- I use a D6 to choose among equal options when the best choice isn't apparent), and its been great fun.  

Love the customizable component, and how elegantly it is integrated into this surprisingly deep tactical area-control strategy game.  And the cool fantasy theme plus the extraordinary quality and creativity of the minis is truly stunning.

So happy I saw this and dug it out from the back of a cabinet where it had been forgotten for so long.

I don't like collectibles because they are games that continue to soak up money if you want to stay on top.  The person with the most money invested in the game has a distinct advantage.

It's a collectible game, and I'm not particularly fond of that genre. Keeping track of the character values, their rarity, the possible combos... Yuck!

Still, as a strategical and tactical game it's quite good. It manages to remain simple, a feat rarely seen in the world of miniatures, while keeping some element of strategical positioning. A good mix of an eurogame and a miniature game.

Kind of a chess-y miniatures game played with collectible pieces, each having Magic: the Gathering-esque abilities, and special dice.  A very interesting game.  Bought a starter & couple of boosters when it came out, but I don't want to "go down that road", so I haven't played much & will probably get rid of it.  Its popularity seems to be flagging.  Shame, though.  Nice game.

I had no idea what to expect from Dreamblade. I found a bunch of figures at a thrift shop. I thought it would come off as a typical collectable game, with funky, ham-fisted rules that were there for those who wanted to invest all their patience, time and money into a game.  What I got was a very interesting, clean battle system where each unit had different stats and advantages and interacted in cool and intriguing ways.  This could have easily been a board game and it's too bad WotC went the CMG route, though this gave us more than 300 figures to work with! Awesome minis - love the design, very decent paint jobs and a different theme that goes beyond the standard fantasy camp.  Combat can feel a little swingy, as a big handful of dice rolled poorly can give you just as good results as a small handful rolled well, but dice games are always about playing to the percentages, and it's done just fine here.  The game isn't so involved to get upset about any wild swings of luck and fortune on the battlefield.  For me, this feels most like games like Summoner Wars, but Dreamblade is definitely its own thing.  A surprise hit!

I'm ambivalent about Dreamblade.

The miniatures look terrific.  The game is fun to play, with fists full of dice and bizarre monsters mashing it up.   It offers plenty of interesting choices governing maneuver, risk, and pace.  The balance is pretty good, and most of the pieces appear to be useful.  In short, it's a well-crafted game.

But in spite of what I've just written, I regret getting into Dreamblade.  It's collectible.  I spent a lot of money on it, and don't really have a regular opponent.  The minis are so damn cool that I wanted almost all of them.  I've been able to steel myself against the expansions, so I won't be sinking any more money into the game.  I don't plan to "stay current" with the game - I learned that lesson long ago with Magic: The Gathering.

So what I now have is a very expensive, very good looking standalone two-player game.  I enjoy playing it, but I won't play it enough to justify the cost.

Great miniatures in a game with a surprising and welcome Euro feel, where you fight for valuable spaces on the board. The different costs to spawn creatures is nice, but some sort of point system to limit the overall strength of the players' armies would make things even better. It's still a dicefest, but it also requires a lot of tactical positioning. The game might use some adjustments (tied rounds may prolong it indefinitely, for example), but the big turn-off is its collectible aspect. I would buy it if it came in a real game box, with a decent board and was sold as a complete game.

Wow, what a fun game!  The mini's look fantastic, and when taken as a whole really do give a dream/nightmare vibe.  The game itself is well thought out, not hard to pick up, and plays quickly.  Lots of interesting decisions to be made, and victory can litterally be snatched from the jaws of defeat with some good play.  I like that there are no point values to building a warband, but you do need to have a balnced one.Cross chess with Mage Knight and you have an idea of what to expect from Dreamblade.  One of the nicest gaming surprises for me in a long time.It's a shame that the game is out of print, but at least you can get the minis cheap now.  I've found an online vendor who is selling boosters for $1.99.  Needless to say my collection has grown quite a bit!

Lets see here.  Magic turned miniatures.  Play area similar to a 5x5 chessboard with victory point spaces.  Dice with a little bit of luck to do your magic abilities.  You now have probably the best game I ever played.  It took me 4 games before I was able to see the detail of the game play and the multiple levels of strategy going on to be in awe of what this game could do.  It such a shame that WotC handled the release of this game so badly.

Pretty straightforward game - maybe even a bit predictable, but strategic nonetheless. The CCG-like mechanic of bringing pieces into play based on "resources" you already control is quite clever, and several rules work to keep games balanced. The main flaw might be the game's susceptability to optimal warbands, but if you're not so competetive that you always have to play the latest, most-tested and best-received warband, there's so much variety it's hard to tire of it.

I loved Dreamblade, but the business model made no sense.  It was far too costly to be able to entice new or casual players in.  I was $400 into the game when it was canceled and I barely had the pieces I needed to field the most basic of the meta tournament warbands at the time.  

I spent far too much time loaning out my pieces and cursing the pieces that I was missing (which even years after the game was canceled are still outrageously expensive to buy from other players).  I could see Dreamblade coming back under a new business model and I would definately buy into it if it was sold in sets.  

The game offers an amazing combination of chess-like board positioning alongside a slight push-your-luck dice rolling aspect that allows for some spectacular play.  Even with a hint of randomness due to the dice, the game was easily dominated by the best "board position" players out there.  In my local area the guys that were good at chess were the best Dreamblade players while the "hardcore board gamer" was always relying on the dice to pull out a victory.  And this was not bad at all and it lead to a great ying and yang push and pull to the meta game.  It was great to see Kitsune/Brighthammer warbands face off against Ragedrake/Temple warbands in the initial set (minus the fact that Kitsune was fundamentally broken in competitive play before it was banned).

I love this game, and the minis are top-notch, but I can't find anyone else to play in the area. The collectible aspect of the game and WotC's hubris and greed has killed this game. We didn't need much past the first set of minis for the game to be oversaturated anyway. Despite the aforementioned complaints about the way this game was devloped and killed by WotC, the core game apart from that is really neat. Position your minis around the board, take advantage of any abilities they may have, and if you have designed a decent warband, interactive effects will help you win. So great game design and wonderful flavor. Poor development and greed killed it (along with it being collectible).

This is my favorite game and I would have a hard time to explain why.  For me it just has that "WOW" factor.  A game can be played in less than an hour-CHECK.  Lots of cool minis (or toys as my son and wife like to call them)-CHECK.  Almost every piece has a neat ability-CHECK.  Lots of different warband building possibilities-CHECK.  It has all those cool things going for it and that does not even come close to explaining why I enjoy this game.  My only regret is not getting into it when it was new.

It's one of those games where I don't mind loosing (and it happens a lot), I'm just having a good time because I'm playing.  I think Dreamblade is all kinds of fun and would not turn down a game.

Now, off to find one of them Octorillas.......

This is a great game, it has easy to learn mechanics but great strategy.  You can teach the game to a person in 5 minutes, but the strategies and interactions between the pieces take a while to pick up.  As others have said this is really more of a boardgame than a miniatures game.  As a store owner I was a little worried with my friends and customers because I knew the game play would interest them, but that the collectible aspect would turn them off.  The nice part is that you can have a good competative warband with only a few rares.  Warband construction is 16 figures no more than 3 of a kind.  Many of the staples of good armies are commons or uncommons (Spellbound Scissors, Cannibal Pariah, Inspired Samurai, Pearlthorne Castle, Hawk-Eyed Instigator...).  Right now Valor seems to have an advantage, at the Gencon constructed tournament it seemed that almost everyone was playing a Valor/Something army.  Hopefully the next expansion in October will help diversify the warband some.  Though it could also be that Valor is the most straight forward and that as people play they will develop great warbands using the other aspects.

I'd call this a very good abstract strategy game with some dice-rolling combat thrown in. The minis are nice, though expensive (especially if you want the rares).

This game is a wolf in sheeps clothing. It looks like a weird minis game, and the fact that it is collectible signals (to some people at least) that is less serious.
But in fact the game is highly strategic, and even though there are minis that are cool to have, you can still play (and have a good time) with a lot less minis than other collectible games require.
The game mechanics ensure a tight and exciting game from start to finish.

RATING: 6
Like the figs very much.  Gives me the feel of chess on steroids.  IMHO the large number of figs with different abilities is both a strength and weakness of the game.  The strength is that the variety adds for replay and something new to be experienced.  The down side is that it's hard for a casual player of the game (such as myself) to do well as they will seldom know most of the abilties of the figs and thus can't plan very well for using their own fig abilities and/or preparing for the oppossing figs abilities.

Yeah, it's that good. After 10  years of playing Magic, I didn't expect to play another CCG again.  So, I guess I'm playing a CMG now. A friend showed me the game, and I was instantly hooked.

It's a miniatures game, but it plays like a boardgame / wargame.  Yes, there are dice involved, but it's not buckets-o-dice like WH 40k.  Can you win on pure luck?  Yes, but probably not often.  

Compared to boardgames, this one is expensive.  Compared to CCG's it's dirt cheap. There certainly are powerful rares, but the bulk of the good pieces for constructed come from the uncommon slot.  Some of the commons are clearly made for sealed / draft, and are junk in constructed.  The rares are odd or powerful.  Most rares currently sell on the secondary market for $5-12.  A select few are in the $30-40 range, but they are by no means required (especially if you're not travelling to the larger 1k and 10k tournaments).

When comparing the price to other CCG's it's important to remember that your warband is 16 minis.  This is a big difference from 60 cards, and helps to offset the cost greatly.

The game plays great in a limited environment. It's pretty hard to get "color screwed" because of the way that the aspect costs work with the spawning rules. (It might take a little more resources to get out a mini if he's a one-off of a color, but you can still get him into play.)

Two-booster sealed is pretty dumb.  That's the weakest link here.  It's just way too much of a lottery system.

Three-booster sealed is a much better format, but that's going to run $45 usually.

Two-booster draft is awesome.   It adds an hour to the tournament time, but it's so very much worth it. This is a very fun game to draft in.

There is a small but active Vassal community.  Live play is loads better, but it's hard to beat Vassal for knocking out a game at 11 PM.  The module supports both constructed with all sets or sealed deck with the latest set.  Playing 3-booster sealed for free is probably the best feature of the Vassal module.


Re: WotC
It's a huge shame the way that WotC treated its customers.  Someone, please reprint this as a non-collectible, yet customizable boardgame (like Blue Moon).

Strategic collectible miniatures game. There is quite a bit of variability in the powers, and I like feel of the game in general. Turns are quite fast with some interesting choices to be made. Overall, however, the game takes too long to play. There is no way to have a quick game (it doesn't scale correctly if you shave off conquest points). And I thought more could've been done to balance the dice-rolls. There's nothing more frustrating than setting up huge odds in your favor, and having your plans washed away with some bad rolls.

Components: The paint-job on the minis is fantastic. Not the typical factory-sprayed 4-colored minis. These ones really look great. The rest of the components are okay-ish, the map is a little ugly, but there is a nice help-summary on the side.

I cannot rate Dreamblade as a collectible miniatures game; it's not that I don't have my doubts, but Magic has shown us it's possible to botch balance early and often and still have a rich game in there for those with the knowledge and inclination to dig it out. Then again, perhaps Dreamblade in its much shorter publishing window never reached the point where the game itself could transcend its commercial context.

As a skirmish game Dreamblade is not terribly heavy, though it does have tactical considerations as well as a decent variety of powers and a piquant fantasy/horror theme. There may be a touch of running all your guys to the middle of the map and beating on some other guy, and a bunch of minis have abilities that are weak, situational, inelegant or plain annoying, but I figure you could do worse than play around a bit with various strategies and team configurations. If balance is an issue, swap warbands after each game.

RATING: 4
(August 2006)
A Collectible Miniatures Game.  Looks like a new and interesting concept.  But it's collectible... OMG, why did I buy this?  I feel like I'm being sucked down the rabbit-hole!

This is the CMG game I decided to try... for a couple of reasons:

1. I like the theme. It is not a re-tread of already done to death themes. It is not childish or cartoonish.

2. The game play. Most CMGs, it seems to me, are just variations on the "line them up and knock them down" idea. No real game play involved. In Dreamblade, movement looks to be as important as combat. And you can only do one or the other each action phase. The rules appear to be well written and tight. Wizards of the Coast has the experience to write a clear, clean set of rules.

3. Dreamblade is more a boardgame with miniatures than a miniatures game. I'm not a big fan of miniature games, so the solid boardgame foundation appeals to me.

4. Published by Wizards of the Coast. At least I know the game will be around for a while. WoTC is putting a lot of marketing money behind this game. If the game was produced by a smaller company without the marketing muscle of WoTC, I would be worried that the game is "too different" to be accepted by the market (which normally wants "more of the same.")  UPDATE: Ha!  What a joke.  When sales didn't meet expectations, WotC dropped this game like a hot potato.  

5. It's different. Dreamblade is not your typical CMG clone. There's something new here. It may not make it in the marketplace but it's worth taking a look at.

UPDATE: All of the above remains true but the balance has tipped and I've decided to stop playing Dreamblade.  First, it's collectible.  To be competitive in tournaments you have to spend money to get the good rares.  The top warbands are all rare heavy.  It's just the nature of collectible games.  Dreamblade is no different.  Secondly, I've decided that I just don't like the dice-based result system.  There are good dice-fests and there are bad dice-fests.  For me, Dreamblade is a bad dice-fest.  In the end the game just doesn't work for me and there are too many other games I'd rather spend my time playing.

I like chess. I like monsters. Dreamblade for me ideally links these fancies. Fantastic is in this game this that  always after executed action one perceives other plays which would be able to be better from this of already executed. Figurine very climatical (from the starterpack, in boosterpack are already too... hideous?), it is not necessary maniacally to buyboosterpacks, well to play (I have the starterpack and 2 boosterpacks, what every bit suffices to me to the good play).

Aside from the boring gameplay of move your guys forward and roll dice, this game has some of the most decidedly ugly models I have ever seen. Silly, (human who walks on his hands and attacks upside down, with his feet of blades), dumb, (human with a hammer for a head), and bizarre, (the flying vagina), there was maybe one decent monster model in the group that I played with. Perhaps I am used to the fine sculptures of Games Workshop or Warmachine, but this was just distasteful.

RATING: 9
My initial impressions here are very strong.  The pieces are well designed and rendered, the rules are well thought-out and (thankfully!)straightforward, and the game offers many opportunities for clever tactical play (I suspect the warband building aspects offer room for strategic variety as well but I cannot confirm that yet).  The theme was not a selling point for me but the game itself is first rate.  Oddly enough, beneath the well painted, hyperthematic minis and the plethora of dice rolling there is an elegant abstract game here.  The combination of elements makes the game more than the sum of its parts.  Unfortunately, it's collectible but one can obtain enough pieces to satisfy all but those interested in competitive play outside their circle of friends rather cheaply.

This is a fun collectible, relatively simple.  It is all about owning space, like chess. I play with my friend's collection or proxies because I'm far too cheap to buy much myself.  I have a little, but don't much like the figures, so I'm happy with proxy cards.

RATING: 7
The idea behind game is actually quite good. It is an area control game with character powers. The board structure is inspired. Cells are only worth points if you claim them uncontested (no enemy characters) and cells are worth more the further they are from your home base (which is also closer to your opponent's home base).

The problems with the game are collectiblity and dice.

The collectible nature of the game kills many of the good aspects highlighted above. Forgetting the random aspect of boosters or that some characters are very weak and other very powerful, the problem with collectibility is that is makes the first step to playing the game the most difficult. The first step? Choose the characters you will use in the game. To do this well, it takes experience with the game system and with the characters. This makes the game very difficult to introduce to anyone.

Next, the dice. The dice in the game are okay, but you roll many of them very often. Two sides of every die are misses so you can roll a fistful of dice, yet roll very low. An annoying feature that could have easily been fixed by having a "1" be the lowest score on each die. Even better, make each miss be a 1/2. Then every two missed is at least 1 hit.

Collectable miniature boardgame with great prepainted figures.  Simple combat system works well hiding a deceptively deep strategy game.
If you like monsters, this is a great game though it can be longish.

RATING: 10
Fantastic new minis game that feels like they melded chess and magic with a few other minis ideas.

What I especially like:

Preset board: no special movement ranges or measuring, or the like. Simple and easy. There is also a beginner's side of the board that has most of the starting rules on  it, including reminders about important info.

Info: Everything you need to know is right on the base of the mini. a summary is on top of the base. All the bases are color coded for easy reference.

Quality: Simply the best non metallic minis I have ever seen. They have McFarlane toys quality paint jobs as well. 

It's easy to learn too. The building of armies, just like deckbuilding in other games, is flexible, fun, and challenging.

Update: Now with the release of Night Fusion the game has definitely come into it's own. This is definitely the best set released thus far AS A WHOLE. It most certainly has some of the most powerful pieces in the game. Given this expansion, I have upgraded my rating to a 10.

Dreamblade was an excellent game, but was marketed only to the die-hard collectible gamer. The game is now officially dead as WOC gave up on the tournament scene and stopped supporting the game.   The product was not cheap and with expansions released every 3 months, it was impossible for all but the most die-hard fans to keep up. 

The gameplay was fascinating and deep and only got deeper with each new release. There was also an online gaming scene on Vassal that was vibrant for a time.

I actually was involved in the tournament scene for a short while (see my session report on the Orlando 10k) and it was fun while it lasted.  I will keep my figures for a casual game now and then.

I got a ton of figures in a trade.

So far it seems really promising. It's a lot more abstract than I was expecting which is both good and bad. Only bad because I'm generally not a huge fan of abstracts, but good because it's done with some mega chrome on top of it's solid mechanics.

I still will probably use the figures more for RPGs than the actual game, but either way I'm really happy to have it.

Plays 2. Collectable Miniatures game. Dead as of 2007. An interesting take on CMGs. Each player builds a force of 16 models. There are no point costs only deployment costs - this is one of the more novel design points. The game features a lot of tactics, army development and manuevering. A superb game that was developed, marketed and handled poorly.

2-18-09 updated rating to 7 from 6. Mechanically sound, deep game with horrible development and marketting.

In its core mechanisms, this is one of the greatest games I've played - maybe the best two player strategic conflict game ever.

It suffered from a few issues that eventually killed it - a theme few could relate to, a random pack buying structure that, in combination with balance issues in later sets, added a lot of frustration to a great core game.

Still, if you want a marvelous two player strategy game, pick up some stuff still floating around out there on the cheap. You won't regret it.

This game has sooo much potential.  At first I didn't really want to even look at it as it was just another miniature entry in the collectible mini market.... but then I went on the wizards of the coast website and tried a demo copy... and I am hooked.  It will be really hard for me to get others involved in this though.  My friends don't do collectible anything anymore.    I taught the game to two friends and I just loved the feel. 

I recently started a Dreamblade league and I am very much enjoying the game.  I hope to get everyone hooked.  I just hope Wizards slows down on the expansion sets - 1 per year would suit me fine.  I also hope the game doesn't get yanked as I think WotC was disappointed with sales so far.

Also, I did a full review for Counter Magazine.

My 11 year old son and I picked this up at Gen Con, and he's asked to play it every day since (and I've been willing to play!). It's very much a board game with neat figures instead of a mini's game with big squares. We need to pick up more figures as we've started to run out of different combinations with the starter box of 16 that we have. I do recommend it, there is more to this game than I had anticipated. UPDATE - Still playing it almost every day the past month. Bumped the rating up and have hooked more friends.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy the game, and I love the theme and miniatures. Simple, fun, devilishly brutal, so many characters and tactics to choose from.

There are probably other games in which you can stage battles with chainsaw-wielding clowns, mutant octopus-gorillas, crocodiles with sideways snapping heads, two-headed dragons and animated scissors. It's a sick, sick world, after all. But I'm not [i]aware [/i]of another one (and please message me if you are, because my want list is ever-hungry.)

The collectible aspect isn't an issue for me. If you don't want to collect the set, then don't collect the set. If you don't want to spend a lot of money, then don't spend a lot of money. Now that it's dead, there are a lot of people trading.

I have traded for three large batches of these and purchased two cases of boosters, and I LOVE these figures.

After buying a couple of large lots, I am now changing this list to show what I need to complete a play set of three of each figure. Bolded figures are ones I have none of and would be especially interested in acquiring:

Basically, this is the game I wanted when I bought Memoir '44 a year or two ago. A tactical and strategic game without a lot of finnickiness. (Measuring, area of effect, line of sight.) This game fills that need in my heart. And I can't play it enough.

RATING: 8
Finally! Something new and fresh coming out of the CMG markert. This is definitely a breath of fresh air, a really nice design doing a great job at merging miniatures and boardgames. I found the initiative roll a touch too random for me, and you can loose in the first few turns if you are not careful, but otherwise it's a blast. I like how it seems like several different strategies are viable; the weenie rush, the big meanie, control, combat, push/shove, etc. Looking forward to expansions.

I have long searched for some game to collect. A%A:Miniatures didn't make it, because it needed too many packs before it could be played properly.

I'd rate it a 7 if and only if i can play with an house rule: no special rule for rolling 1s (if you roll a 1 you skip your placement phase); imho it's really a bad rule that only adds randomness to a nice game that really doesnt need it.

Well, sure enough, the collectible aspect screwed me.  I enjoyed it a lot as long as there wasn't an expansion to collect, but when suddenly there were dozens of new figures to worry with, and I felt I had just gotten the basic figures figured out, I gave up.  Oh well.  Great sculpts, though, and  a pretty good game in the end, I think.  I just doubt I'll ever play much more.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a team is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

RATING: 7
Dreamblade has everything I love in a Board Game: unbelievably cool miniatures in a dark 'Lovecraftian-D&D' horror theme, high strategy with a balance of luck, easy rules with high re-playability and lots of team building to think about.

The rules are so elegantly simplistic you can grab a handful of minis, dive right in and have a blast immediately. Only upon scratching the surface though you will also then discover there is actually a very deep well of gameplay and strategy here too.

The many available minis have a variety of abilities and statistics to rival any CCG, and should keep the average stat-cruncher busy for a very long time. I'm happy with the pile of Common/Uncommon monsters plus a few Rares collected from a comparatively cheap investment on eBay. Chase figures are not necessary, and although some Rares are very powerful even the cheap and plain monsters have their place in most casual play builds.

The game itself is highly strategic and reminds me somehow of Chess. In fact if I could describe Dreamblade in other games its like Chess + Magic: The Gathering + Horrorclix = Dreamblade.

Never been into collectable mini's, but this game took me by surprise. Dropped a bunch of money into the base set but I doubt I will follow up with the expansions. Still, the idea of a 'colletable chess' like game is fresh and fun. Edit: Now that you can get boxes for 20 bucks this game is a no brainer. With the 250-some-odd mini's that are out there you can make yourself a collectible board game that you will enjoy for a long time.

RATING: 7
A refreshingly different kind of CMG. There's actually a game here, instead of just plain skirmish. The theme isn't that interesting or consistent but the miniatures are of higher quality than in other CMGs. 

Another nice touch is that there are no cards or counters; all the information is on the figures themselves. Unlike you'd expect, this isn't a problem at all, since most of the special powers are activated by rolling blades. If you don't roll any blades, there's no need to remember which powers your troops have. 

The miniatures in first three sets seem to be of roughly similar strength but the fourth and fifth set seem to supercharge the pieces a bit too much. Also, they bring new factions as well (or non- and dual-faction pieces, to be precise).

RATING: N/A
Half of me says "I have spent too much money" but the other half says "cool figures". I am fairly confident that I am going to enjoying playing this one - I just hope my wife thinks the same so I get value for money.
First impressions without having played:
The figures are good - some of the characters are really impressive.
The board is paper - I understand a collectable game coming in a small box means a sturdy game board is out of the question but with all the folds the playing surface is going to be a tad awkward. I am not sure if I can source a laminating machine big enough to do the job either...
Only 1 initiative dice per starter. It would have been better if there were 2 for those only wanting one starter so we don't have to break open the monopoly board and steal that one. I know it's inexpensive to buy extra die but it's the small things ...
Still, very much looking forward to playing this one.

My impression of the game has gone up after (1) playing alot more games and (2) obtaining more figures.  Unfortunately the game gets better as your number of figures of grows, such is life in a CMG.

I have the Starter Set and a bunch of spare miniatures (a friend's gift). The game seems tactical and the mechanics interesting (remembers me a lot of Magic TG); miniatures are a bit strange, not so good... The theme is too much abstract for my tastes.

After having read the rules again after a long time of not playing the game I must say: the rules are quite complex, but at least they make sense and are therefore easy to remember. I have read the rules in preparation of playing. The english rulebook is of very good quality.

After play: high game play weight with the complex rules and all the special abilities of the figures, high effort to build up the game with all the figures, luck involved with the combat dice. I prefer Summoner Wars.

RATING: 6
game is a bit too random; there is a lot of variance in the die rolls (especially the 1/6 chance of blades, which trigger most special powers), which overshadows the interesting strategy.  Don't get me wrong:  the _balance_ of the units is very well done, and there are both interesting tactics and strategy...but balanced face-offs are pretty high variance producing unsatisfying runaway wins early in the game independent of skill or choices.

The minis are really well done, and very surreal.  They make good use of transparent plastic, and have original interpretations of a lot of weird and novel dreamworld creatures.  Very well done artistically.

Quick and simple, at least in the random, out of the starter mode.  I'm interested enough that I'll play some more when I get a chance, and might eBay for a bunch of cheap common figs.

After two plays, I can say it was more fun with somewhat more focused forces.  (We bought another starter set and simply divided them into two forces composed of two colors each.)  I like it as a quick and dirty game.

Fantastic game, better than any other collectible game I've ever played (and I've played most of them). Coming from an abstract background, with a love of thematic combat with variable powers and a preference for dice over cards for randomness, this is as good as it gets (only exception: Mage Wars Arena). 

Collected all the figs from all the sets, built custom boards, played as much as possible. sadly, ran out of opponents. After a dry spell of three years without being able to get a game in, gave up and sold everything to somebody overseas. So sad!

the problem with collectible games with high complexity is that opponents eventually dwindle to nothing when the game loses popularity. Unless one is in a major metropolis, I suppose. Not *quite* willing to move to play more games.

Decent game, crappy components. The dice randomness seems less manageable than the card drawing and paid power activation in MtG, and the collectable aspect is more pronounced with the smaller 'deck' size here. Has a lot of potential, but not for me at present. I'd like to see this released as a couple of precon boxed sets with unpainted minis.

If you're considering this game, think of Corunea as a possible alternative.

If you can find Starters or Boosters in the bargain bin, pick them up and give this game a chance.

Bought a starter: probably the best looking CMG figures on the market. The sculpts are detailed and suits the theme and the paint job is more than admirable. But damn, it had to be collectible! Also, one needs extra bits NOT included in the set to track several game details (Spawn points, etc).

Update: Not a bad little game. Players use the values of their initiative D6 rolls as spawn points to put monsters on the board. Each player then gets 2 actions per turn. This can be to move to an adjacent square or to strike an enemy in a square. Characters in each of the 4 factions have different abilities; some defensive, others offensive. The object is to get more 'capture' points for either killing enemies or occupying enemy squares; first to 5 wins.

In theory, the game is sound. In reality, there is a problem with a predictable game pattern; players can only spawn at one corner or in rows with their figures on it. The limited movement makes the game follow a fixed early development pattern. Things do start to pick up a little but I'm sure that some extra time spent on tweaking the gameplay could have solved this issue. Not bad but overly hyped.

Great pieces, but too much randomness, the whole roll a 1 and skip the spawn phase can just kill the game (we rolled 3 in a row once and I had no units left so it gave my opponent an instant win = dumb). With slight mods this game would have been so much better, sad really.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Area Control, Tactical, Customizable. Wow, what a great game. The beauty of high-quality prepainted plastic minis coupled with a very good, battle for control of a 5x5 grid/board. Relatively simple rules + collectible/customizable figures = a ton of replayability. Fortunately for my group, the game is dead so we're picking up boxes for cheap.

RATING: 7
Dreamblade is what Chess should be, at least for me. Even though it's a very different game, there is a Chess-like feel to moving your pawns about and engaging the other player. Dreamblade is fantasy Chess done right - Dungeon Twister, by comparison (for me), is fantasy Chess done wrong. Success in Dungeon Twister relies upon planning, planning, planning - as far ahead as you can. The better you are at seeing massive decision trees in your head, the better you will do. This doesn't make it a "bad" game, I just find that I do not enjoy it. Dreamblade, on the other hand, relies upon (a) putting together a good warband - whether via drafting or pre-selection, (b) making the right spawn choices at the right times, and (c) moving into and holding strategically valuable positions. The variability of the miniatures adds a level of interest to the game, a bit of welcome Magic-ification, yet Dreamblade is a much more straightforward sort of game than Magic. Partly, this is due to the fact that your opponent can see what units you have right off the bat. There is no hidden information.

On your turn, you can either "shift" your on-board units by moving each one by one cell, or you can "strike" with any units you choose - if they share cells with enemy units. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, and is well implemented. There's great tension, and at least the possibility that your master strategic plan will be foiled. Unit abilities and traits allow for some cool interactions. Make no mistake: Dreamblade is a pretty cerebral game, hence mentions of Dungeon Twister and Magic. And although I'll always be a huge Magic fan, there's room in the clubhouse for Dreamblade too.

The only con is that it is collectible. (grrrr.) This is really a double-edged sword, as the variation of units helps make the game so interesting, but it also elevates the cost to play if you want to have a good selection of units. Fortunately, the rare units aren't all that much better than many of the uncommons, and so you can put together pretty awesome warbands without rares. And you can pick up lots of commons and uncommons on eBay for decent prices.

Don't let the collectable aspect of this game fool you. It's a very good game! Imagine playing Magic the Gathering where you have full access to your entire deck each turn, but you never know how much mana you're going to have. On top of this, where your creatures are placed on the board is more important than how strong they are, so even weak creatures are important. Every time I play this I notice something new about the interaction of the pieces and want to play another game immediately. Unfortunately not many people want to play this and it's dropped of the face of the earth. It's a shame it wasn't released as a boxed game with a set of about 20 figures on each side instead of as a collectible game. The theme is also really out there and I think worked againsted it.

Played 100+ times
Excellent collectible stategic board game. The round by round scoring is brilliant. The powers are fun, army building is fun, the figures are cool, the whole game concept is cool. I have about 250 figures.

The collectable aspect is fine for one reason: The rares are no more powerful in gameplay than the commons. That means anyone can get into the game and be competitive.

Going second in each round is a huge advantage. Sure, once in a while it is an advantage to go first, but the second player has perfect information at the start of his turn and can figure out exactly what he needs to do to capture the most points for the round, without interference. The only unknown to the second player is a battle outcome. However, first of all, the second player can use strikes (attacks) to his advantage because he will know if an attack is even necessary for a point majority that turn, and second, the second player will never have one of his creatures disrupted or destroyed as a result of initiating an attack.

I am way more tolerant of dice than most people. This game even pushes my threshold. Initiative, which is HUGE, is determined by a simple die roll. Battle dice result can vary wildly. It is tough to manage probabilities.

RATING: 9
This game is highly underrated. Yes, it is "collectable", but not for me. I just got together two good, balanced armies, and play it like an un-collectable game. Each figure has its own special abilities, and sometimes drawbacks, and the sculpts are fun and quite varied, as it is supposed to take place in a dreamlike world. So, you are both attacking each others creatures and attempting to hold certain spaces on the grid board. It reminds me of the holographic game that chewbacca and r2d2 played in the first Star Wars . You also spawn more monsters in certain spaces, and the custom dice in this game which are used to attack are really amazing. The battle mechanic is really fun, easy to teach, and flows very well. Wish more people knew how great this one is -

A friend of mine had bought a large bunch of Dreamblade minis on Ebay and we tried it out. It was fun but suffered from the limitations of the minis we had access to. I like games where you get to build a force and then take it to the game board to try it against somebody else. But I don't like collective games where money become a issue to be able to compete. If somebody would give me a bargain of a lot of minis I would probably buy it, because it felt like a fun game under the pretext that you have enough minis. Anybody selling?

I wanted to like this game, especially being a fan of Magic and plunking down $60 for this, but it just doesn't work for me.  It's a positional strategy game, so pretty much the only important aspect of the game is movement - and all pieces move the same way.  What type of effects are the most powerful?  The type that lets you move more often than your opponent - the special abilities "skirmisher," and "advance," for instance.  What's the best piece in the game?  The Scarab Warcharm, which lets you do both, is tough to kill, and is cheap to boot.  Any tournament player will have to play with 3 of them, which is why they go for $35+ dollars on the secondary market.  Already, most every warband that's won a tournament has had 3 of these, so that gives you an idea of how fun it is to play in a tournament. 

Like Magic, the most fun way to play this may be by purchasing a raft of commons on the secondary market, and maybe a few uncommons for flavor, and to avoid the blind booster purchases.  Or just play with a friend's copy.  I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone without the proviso of try before you buy - the miniatures are fantastic, but this is not a miniatures game.  It's an area control game on a 5x5 board.

Who would have thought there’s a great little CMG like this? I played this last night while rather tipsy, I got the depth of it about halfway through. It's actually really got a lot of interesting chess like qualities with some elements of luck and Magic style game play in the mix. When we first got this at the store I used to work, the demo was swiftly mocked and discarded. Don't let the marketing fool you, this is actually a really decent game! Yeah some of the Minis are really lame but there’s some great production quality in them so you can forgive the silly monsters available. It’s almost like if you were playing a game of magic with your entire decks monsters and your mana kept changing each round. Worth taking a peek at or getting a starter for sure.

I picked up this game a couple years after it died, when I needed something to give me free shipping on an order. Boosters were $1.50 each, so I grabbed some.

Now, a few months later and $50 spent, I have something approaching 400 figures. It's simply a blast to play, and scratches the deckbuilding itch I still have from MTG.

I would have rated this a 6 or 7 due to the collectibility and cost back when it was alive. Now, as a non-collectible super-cheap miniature/board game hybrid, it's one of my favorites.

RATING: 6
Two dream warriors battle it out using monstrous terrors brought forth from the dreamscape they both inexplicably share. The miniatures are an eclectic mix of "nightmare" creatures, although the choice of sculpts is uneven at best. After all, what's more terrifying than a pair of boots? Maybe it's the numerous creature models that look like bung holes. Literally.

Although it was released as a collectible miniatures game, Dreamblade is really an area control board game. Monsters are placed and maneuvered to control scoring areas, in order to accrue victory points. This is usually far more important than simply trying to kill enemy units, providing a nice change of pace from other miniatures games.

There does seem to be a bit of what I consider a chess hindrance though, especially at higher levels play. There is almost always a 'correct move', even on the first turn of the game. The dice are usually the deciding factor among expert players, as most of the actions a player takes are somewhat scripted. More than once I've considered just dispensing with the actual game and rolling off a D20 to determine the winner. Of course, this is really only true at the expert level of play and I suppose it can be argued that many games devolve to this if played often enough. For the casual gamer, Dreamblade carries the fun factor pretty well.

Personally, I spent a good deal of time playing Dreamblade at the tournament level. While I was probably better than casual gamer guy, I was nowhere near the upper echelon of "pro" players. I did get to play with the aforementioned tournament masters though, and overall it was a good experience. One thing I didn't enjoy however, were some of the crazy rules interpretations that sprung up over the course of the game's life. Rulings and clarifications made by WOTC were often confusing and counter-intuitive, and many of them still baffle me. These rulings were often difficult, if not impossible to explain or justify to a new player. We eventually had a really hard time getting new players into the fold and I believe that the crazy rules glitches were a big factor. Secondly, this game was super expensive to get into. A booster pack was fifteen dollars for seven figures, most of which were unplayable due to poor unit balance (which I neglected to mention above). The steep price and even steeper learning curve were probably the most insurmountable hurdles to the success of this now dead game.

 Hardcore play made me overly analytical about the game, and as a result I have a tough time playing it for fun. It often feels more like work than casual time, in part because of my tournament experiences. As a result, Dreamblade has been mostly retired for me.

I don't play anymore, at all. So technically this gets a geek rating of zero, but that's not really being objective about it... ;)

Prohibitively expensive if you want to be competitive, but incredible fun and strategy for casual play.

Now that WotC has all but shelved it, you can probably pick up packs for dirt cheap.

In the dreamscape explore a shifting landscape of ancient archetypes, modern terrors, and mismatched elements of the waking world. This is the shared unconsciousness of humanity, the boundless well of hopes and fears that makes us human. Draw upon psychic energies to create formidable creatures that you control in battle. Confront your opponents, destroy their creations and drive them from the dreamscape!

Excellent game with truly amazing miniatures. The only downside was the collectible aspect and the fact the game is now dead.

Best design and production quality from Wizards of the Coast ever, coming from the best RPG designers in the world: Rob Heinsoo and Jonathan Tweet. Glad I picked this up when the line had dried up; I would have avoided it otherwise due to its being tournament driven and collectible.

a Very cool game, if you didn't have to buy lots and lots of blisters to find what you were looking and you don't like wandering on the net to find some spare miniatures..

indeed, a cool setting for a nice game..

Too bad WOTC screw this one. On the other hand, it allowed the game to stop before going "one extension too far" (though it would not have been the next scheduled one in any case).

Figurkowa - kolekcjonerska. Postacie z koszmarow musza zajac kluczowe pola planszy. Kazda postac ma okreslona moc, wytrzymalosc i zdolnosci specjalne. Odpowiednik MTG na planszy. Zarowno dzialania taktyczne na planszy jak i dobor druzyny mocno wplywa na szanse zwyciestwa.

RATING: 8
The game represents two psychics slugging it out using nightmare-monsters and weird dream-creatures in a collective dream-world battleground. On the table, it looks like a strange drug-induced version of the [i]Star Wars[/i] hologram game (played on the Millennium Falcon by Chewie) [i]Dejarik.[/i]

The miniatures for this game are quite, quite brilliant. A work of sublime madness, featuring a rogue's gallery of Midian-like monstrosities from the mind of Clive Barker, realised into plastic by Todd McFarlane-esque sculptors. The paint jobs are world-class for this sort of thing, easily smashing the Pathfinder, and D&D ranges to bits in the quality department. I have a particular liking for the 'location' models - odd places like the *Tower of Faces*.

As others have said, this is not a 'miniatures game' but an area-control boardgame played with variable-power models - the best pre-painted gaming models money can buy.

The collectable buying aspect destroyed this before it got properly going, a few expansions notwithstanding, putting a ton of folks off even playing the game in the first place - me included.

If [i]Monsterpocalypse[/i] had used the memory-jogger rules stickers on the model's base - like they do here - more people might have played that area-control miniatures game too. This has become, like Monpoc, a cult hit totemically worshipped by a clever knowing few.

[b]OUR [i]ONLY[/i] HOUSE RULE: [/b]When initiative is tied, the player who LOST the most turns goes first.

I've gotta give Wizards credit; they've made a collectible miniatures game that's fun, not too luck driven, and one that I would actually want to play.

RATING: 10
There are so many reasons why I rate this game so highly.  It is one of my absolute favorite games of all time!

I am not usually drawn to miniature games, however, this one immediately got my attention.  

The pieces are surprisingly fun to collect, very nicely produced, attractive, thematic and extremely interesting.  I think there is something here for everyone and that is a feat in itself.

Although Wizards of the Coast rubbed me the wrong way with MTG: Magic the Gathering, I was willing to still give this one a try.  I am so happy I did!

Every Dreamblade session has been a blast!  I love the versatility of the miniatures, warbands, factions, etc.  The theme embellishes the game very nicely and makes for a very fun and intense gaming experience!

I am still in the process of completing my collection and would appreciate any contacts concerning trades, sales, etc.  Send me a PM and we can go from there! :)

[UPDATE]
I am really sorry to see this one discontinued.  This was a very bad move on WotC's behalf considering all of the attention it still receives after so many years.  

I originally rated this game a 9, but it keeps hitting the table again and again.  It deserves a 10 without question.

This is a fun game with lots of levels and loads to think about.  Unfortuately, it falls apart for me at the higher levels of tournament competition where dice become too big of a factor.

Excellent game but BOY do I wish it wasn't collectable.  Lots of strategy but dice factor largely too, and as I have worse luck than a fat ginger kid with freckles and glasses I always seem to get screwed over.
Seems that the tournament scene is gathering speed too, which should prove good for the game.

Update: It appears WotC have ditched this game now.  A shame.  Still, least it's no longer 'collectable' I guess.

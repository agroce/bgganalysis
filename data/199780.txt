RATING: 8.3
Not sure about this game just yet.  So far, members of my play group and I have done little but Search.  We almost never Attack.  It is only with card abilities that we interact with other players' characters at all.  So it just becomes a race to see who can get to 10 points first.

I do enjoy playing it and find it fun.  But if the attacking doesn't show itself soon, I can see it running out of steam very quickly.

This game is so simple and basic it's pure genius. It might just be that our gaming group make it such a joy to play - the sassy rulebook and art make us smile, and we insist on adding z to the end of everything, whilst intermittently screaming "PHAT LOOTZ" at opponents when you roll well.

We have only played this game a handful of times.  My 10 y/o gets lost in the other players turns some times so we try to keep it at 2-3 players for faster play.  It's a pretty simple concept but there seem to be a lot of 'little' rules.  We always play with at least one direction card on the table.  It does seem to be more profitable to 'search' instead of 'loot' which does take away from the social interaction of the game as a whole.

Simple filler with very good aspect. It's fun if you enjoy with chaotic games, weak with 2 players

Fun little dungeon crawl with cute art, I rarely get tired of these sorts of games and thus have stacks of them even when they don't get played that often.

It was fun seeing the person in the lead change frequently. It made me laugh but it is an ordinary game.

RATING: 8
It's a suprisingly fun game ! A lot of interations between players, create a lot of funny moments. Even though the luck factor is a bit high, the card combos will make the game shines. With many "take-that" moments, I would recommend this for casual gamer groups who are looking for some laughing time and don't have to spend so much time to think "hmmm... What should my next move be ?"

RATING: 8
A simple card game with lots of funny interaction. It can be very frustrating for some people that want to "build a perfect combo" and keep it until the very end (It will NEVER happen, forget it). but, to me, it was pretty awesome to play it in two players. To lure the other player into a trap and steal his awesome character, etc. To me, this game feels like Epic and Kings gold combined, but waaay better than both.

An amazing mini card game. Born and raised on Yugioh this gives me the feeling of the game I loved as a kid. not a 10 just yet because i've yet to play it more than 10 mins.

RATING: 5
I liked this when I played at a demo - enough to purchase it. It seems like a quick take that game, but on subsequent plays it suffers from no catch up mechanic. Sometimes players just get hosed several times in a row with no way to recover and it ruined their time with the game.

RATING: 5
If I am being tasked to play a Munchkin clone, it better be quick and painless as possible. In this regard, Looterz got full marks. The great bits and small box were another plus. Probably one of the best in this genre of silly and random and worth seeking out if this appeals to you.

I however, am not the target audience, so the best I can offer a game that uses a "z" for an "s" is a score of 5.

Played once. It's quick, but there's much better fillers out there, and this really does feel like a dated game design from the '90's. Components are good quality, and the art is fine, it's just the design itself that's lacking. Lots of take-that. Lots of game-state 'resets'. Lots of roll-and-pray. If that's your thing, go for it.

RATING: 7
The game is made with good quality components and the cartoonist artwork adds charm to the game. The purple dice are a bonus as well! It is a very simple card game that adds elements of CCG's and dice chucking. It does have cheesy cards that reset the board and some might find that annoying but this is a very casual game. I like this game as a filler and has elements of hearthstone in regards to card effects, such as last will (which triggers, after it gets killed, ), taunt (have to kill this looter first to attack others) and etc. The game is very small and is a pretty good stocking stuffer game. The first game I played lasted far too long when others refused to kill my King and I refused to kill it myself.

RATING: 8
Funny and entertaining game that all the family can enjoy. Easy to learn and amusing to play. The quality of components is excellent and the funny/bright art is very appealing and different from other dungeon inspired games with dark and brownish color palettes, a total hit with kids.

I found this game extremely annoying, and I doubt I'll ever want to play it again. Play cards and do well based on how well you roll dice. Meh.

Initial Thoughts
----------------------

Played this with 4 players so far, and it went over "ok".  The game did offer interesting choices, but I really wasn't having a ton of fun.  The game also felt WAY more abstract than I was hoping for.  There are also a ton of Fiddly rules to keep someone from breaking the game, which makes the game explanation a little wonky.

Interested to try with both 2 & 3 players too see if how the game experience changes.

Surprise-gift from the PIFF EU-edition. Apparently it said I wished for this even though I never heard of it so I look forward to finding out what a glitch in the BGG-system wanted me to own. I'm grateful for it though because I probably hadn't looked at this game otherwise and missed a lot of fun.
Easy to play but still demands strategy to make sure you end up with the highest score. I like the older look of the game and that they used actual persons as guests at the café. Only bad thing I could think of is the use of colours - I have a friend who is colour-blind and he had some trouble with identifying things in the game.

Fun gateway game. Pretty sure NY 1901 is gonna crush this game for me. I should play it while I can.

Nice artwork from the depicted era (late 19th, early 20th century) brought down by a simplistic exclusion mechanism powered by semi-randomly drawn cards and horrible colour mismatches between board and cards. One point deduction for the latter, I'm afraid. Other than that... ehhh, it's nice-ish, but with very little actual [i]game[/i]. It's more of a point puzzle, and unfortunately there are better games in this genre, and they can be had for less money too. Even if I take into consideration that the game's target audience might not be the hardcore gamer, I still remain sceptical about its attractiveness. Design mismatches are about the last thing you want in the game then; and is Tobago about treasure hunting then not a more attractive offering for the entire family, rather than the slightly elitist and vicariously-living-through-celebrities attitude that forms the basis of this game's subject matter...?

Café Melange takes players to Vienna in 1910, with prominent individuals such as Trotzky, Klimt and Freud meeting one another in the coffee bar "Central". The players work in the coffee bar and must use logic and deduction in order to place their guests next to these VIPs.

Placing guests at tables through elimination via cards played with some similarities to games like Ticket to Ride and Tobago. The game feels interesting if a little AP-affine at first but suffers from three major detractors.

The first part of the game is of very little relevance as players load up on cards and haphazardly place guests willy-nilly while the game speeds up considerably towards the end, to the point where the board changes so dramatically from turn to turn that you don't really have a lot of influence on the situation any more. It also focuses too much on negative play. Not leaving an opening for the next player is at least as important as getting a good seat for yourself. And finally, some of the special action cards can easily negate a careful placement and make the result feel even more arbitrary.

Spacial game. The premise of the game is sitting at a famous French cafe with famous people. There are two public people and two private people you can work on seating, as you add cards to limit where they are seating once only 1 option remains then they are seating and you get victory points based on their number. Number optimization helpful.

I liked Old Town and thought Schinderhannes was OK.  This is an improvement.  It finds the right balance between luck and skill plus adds some nice twists.

This game is pretty bad... visually it looks like a mess with all the cubes on the board. The end-game scoring does not seem to be balanced at all with the points you score from just placing people as fast as possible.

Clicker games always revolve around deduction. Café Melange is its take on Café International crossed with Tobago and Ticket to Ride. In the first two thirds players poke around more or less unfocussed setting the stage for the last third when things suddenly speed up. Luckily, the three action limit in Café Melange avoids the single point of resolution phenomenon from Schinderhannes where one player was able to resolve all remaining location puzzles at once when enough information was available.
The art for the customer and VIP pieces is great. I also like the contemplative atmosphere of the gameplay but with AP prone players the game drags and the replayability is limited. A good game for a small publisher. A few rough edges were smoothed out as we got the game explained by the author himself.

The mechanic is the same as in Old Town / Schinderhennes / Fleet 1815 (and Tobago). But this one changes things by making you score based on where your guys are versus how much you can reduce a deduction. 

This one change, in my opinion, minimizes luck much farther than previous implementations and takes this game to the next level.

While my wife will tell you that [gameid=42215] is her  favorite deduction game, this is my choice.  Struggling against your opponents to seat notable patrons might sound a bit dull, but it can become rather heated.

Right after playing it I send a geekmail to somebody wanting it.
Now after 12 hours I am not so sure anymore.

The placement of guests (celebrities, and your own) is nice. I wouldn't call it deduction just marginally planning ahead.
the game is just beautiful to look at. This because of tje different art or each celebrity and your own guest.

They could have done a better job with the colour matches though not only cards and the board but also the player colours. maybe it was deliberate because with all the different colours it was nice to look at.

A shame the game didn't come with english rules included. I thought it would because of the german/english edition.

we played with four which probably is not the perfect number. still enjoyable though.

a big plus besides the look of it is that it is easy to explain.
I didn't like the fact that scoring was close. and i believe that players later in turn order have an advantage. certainly so if they have a reseating card

This is interesting as you play clues to either place guests or your own people which can score in and end game points.  Shapes of tables, different color chairs and different color tables are the three elements to manipulate.  Action cards can be nasty and pull a double switch of either guests or persons.  Game does play fairly quickly.  I think I may prefer other games of this nature (IE, Tobago).

A charming game with lovely artstyle and colors. The goal is to take a seat on a table where some important person sits and then points are multiplied etc... You do this by eleminating factors by playing cards.

Only played the basic version at Spiel 2014 but we finished the game and most of us really liked it. Steep price kept us from buying, I hope we won't regret this ;)

Picked up at Essen 2013. Semi impulse-buy, based on short introduction from the designer. Looks promising.

Interesting game, with beautiful theme, artwork and design. 
There are however some problems with the game that remind you that it is not made by a professional:
1) The action cards seem quite unbalanced
2) A lot of subtleties are neither clarified nor discussed in the rulebook
I think house rules are mandatory in this game.

A smooth playing family game of getting customers and important people to the coffee tables for the most points via a smart system. Good looking too.

Hmmm, not so sure about this one after first play. I like the historical characters. But there seems to be a bit weird difference between theme and kinda take that gameplay and snowball effect. I wonder how much control you really have (at least with 4 players, this one might be better with less players)

First play was sort of enjoyable but left me with a taste of 'not as much control as it seems to suggest'.
Well at least it doesn't suck like Ticket to Ride.

Feels a bit like Ticket to Ride for adults or someting.  Sumptuous images.  I think it might be better if you were restricted to being ly able to play two cards on your turn: maybe make the distributions around the tables a bit more agonizing.  Still, the rules pretty easy, and I liked the historical persomages.

Coincidentally, I learned about this game while in Vienna. Some say this is too dependent on luck but I found the two similar games Tobago and Ticket to Ride quite pleasant and am willing to give Café Melange a chance.

I like this kind of games. It's quite simple to explain and easy to play, but it does really matter which guest you put on what table. Also by the end you have to look for opportunities, because sometimes 1 card can be enough to put down a guest. Only minus is that you need a certain luck to get the right cards when an opportunity comes by.

Lovely logic puzzle of a game.  I enjoyed it quite a bit, but my wife enjoys Tobago more, and there's not much reason to keep both games, so... happy wife happy life!

It is a pity that we had to consult the rulebook a few times too many during game play. In essence the game is pretty simple. Assign a guest by using maximum three cards. This way deduction is used to assign the guest a seat. Unfortunately this comes with a lot of bookkeeping.
Nice components and I like the idea of having coffee with Gustav Mahler!

A real letdown!

Like reverse deduction (as in Tobago)
Like the card drawing system (as in Ticket to Ride/Quilt Show)
Like the idea of seating guests at specific tables (as in Cafe International)

BUT... All together, just gets a bit fiddly and messy. And really need more opportunities to play the action cards.

Bums on seats via the medium of elimination.

Do you have a table for me? I'll sit anywhere, as long as the table is square. Oh, and as long as the table is brown, and as long as the chair is blue. My table is ready? What took you so long?

The location-elimination feels a little like Tobago, while the action cards introduce a Fawlty Towers dimension, but on balance I'm positive about the game: despite the fiddlyness of placing & removing markers, there's a certain charm about the theme, the artwork & the relatively small box.

A process-of-elimination style deduction game set in a Viennese cafe. Players represent the locals of the city desperately trying to deduce where the celebrities will sit so they can get a seat at their table.  This game has a similar mechanic as Tobago to eventually narrow the seating options to a single spot at a specific table. Cannot be a brown seat, must be a square table.  Different locals have different point bonus objectives.

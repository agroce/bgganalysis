Excited to finally get this one to the table, but all I can say is I was very disappointed in the game play.  Way too long and slow for what you get out of it.  Too repetitive, not a whole lot of variety.  If I am going to play a Ryan Loaukat game, it will definitely be Above and Below.  I really wish this one was better!

:thumbsup: There are gorgeous details and easily recognizable symbols on practically every component.
:thumbsup: The challenge of working through decisions and optimizing a nation is superb and always exciting.

[microbadge=30754][c] [/c]The content reserved for 3-4 players may have a way to be utilized, but typically the solo player misses out.

Halfway through the game the winner was obvious we couldn't do anything about it and I really couldn't wait for it to end. Very boring unengaging and too chaotic. I would only play this again at gunpoint.
Nice artwork, components and ideas but very bad execution.

Purchased in Geekmarket.  

1st play - solo play for rules consideration and teaching prep.  After the first play, I had a much better understanding of what the mechanics of the game were doing.  There was a lot I could not understand just by reading the rules.  Playing it, it became clear that part of the fun is in exploring what these mechanics do.  Rules mistakes included - Science bonus pays out in 3rd and 5th rounds IN ADDITION to the science earned every round by academies (the iconography made me think the academies only paid out in the 3rd and 5th rounds).

1-5-18 - Downgraded to a 7.  Mechanics can be a bit fiddly in play.  Still a good game, but I'd play several other games before suggesting it.  Still want to play it more, but with a tight economy of time, it is not getting played.

RATING: 8.2
I've not played the original edition, but there's a similar, smooth design here to a lot of his later games that I have enjoyed, so you'll recognize a little Ancient World, etc. Laukat's art is wonderful as usual, and this is a pretty solid Euro style game of resource control, purchasing buildings and regions, and it also has a slight deck building element, plus numerous score phases. I don't know that I like this more than Ancient World or Above and Below, but it's certainly further testament that this designer is a one man force to be reckoned with. I hope he'll give a similar 2nd edition treatment to Empires of the Void, one of his games I don't own yet.

After one play, I have two comments: 1. Beautiful, beautiful looking game, both art and components. 2. There's several things going on that require multiple plays and familiarity with all the cards and upgrade paths need to be learned and clearly understood.  I look forward to a second and third go to get a better sense of my true interest.

RATING: 7.5
A good deck building type game where you each have a deck to buy from with slight variations in each. Game does slow down at the buy card phase because there are so many options but that is part of the game. Card abilities are interesting and the sheer number of goods available is great so you aren't constantly fighting over just a few.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Epic experience, really. I love the clicking gears of this game and how it really pulls you along even when you're struggling to take it all in. The game is really tight, but it still allows you to play from the gut (somewhat), which I love, and the theme really draws me in for more. The funny thing is though, that I only have one play of this, so more data is required, but it makes a great first impression. A bit longer and heaver than what I usually dig, but it is such a great "hybrid" style game, something that I really love right now.

What an improvement over the first edition. Nothing major, just made a lot clearer (and even the addition of names to the different district types makes a difference). Rules a lot clearer and easy to follow... a great civ-building game, that bear the exceptionally high quality of Red Raven Games.

For the game itself, it is a little fiddlier than Ryan's other works, but the concept of building two separate decks is truly innovative. I would have liked to have seen perhaps one less land type for each country (to really force the need to expand into new realms). I didn't really like the use of cubes to mark levels of goods initially (I always like separate tokens), but... seeing it as a stocks chart - it does fit the theme. I would have liked a little more variety between the different races (but that it expansion potential), but do like that automated developments are included as standard. Also: the additional scoring conditions on each landscape are a welcome addition. On the whole, an absolutely solid experience - but one should expect nothing less from the designer.

Kickstarter (Second Edition).  Arrived early in March 2016.  

Beautiful artwork.  The game board is just dreamily stunning.  There's lots of interesting decisions to be made in this game.

The Citizen and Military decks have different cards and it's an interesting twist that you get to choose the order that your cards go in your discard pile.  So when your decks are refreshed, WITHOUT shuffling, you have already chosen the order that you'll draw the cards in. 

I just wish there was MORE of everything.  More lands to explore, more towns to attack and more buildings to build.  I ended up feeling like there's always the same buildings and towns that you've GOT to go for each time.  Having said that I think the way you build your decks is the really clever part of the game and I expect some smart long-term planning will score well.  I've just not got clever enough at the game yet!

2016-10-29 : Very clever engine builder which has many of those "wait-a-sec" moments where you totally reconsider what you're going to do next. Deck combo-builder heaven, but you'll need a learning game first to see how it all clicks together. Over the years I've really come to appreciate games with clear graphics and layout that make it easy to look across the table at what your opponents are doing - and this game has that and more, which adds tremendously to my enjoyment of it. I swear that the next game that comes along and forces 2mm yellow icons on a white background and font size 3 text on me is going to get it where it hurts.
2016-11-21 : 3rd game and rating lowered to 6 - it played out with the group as there's not much to discover after the first couple of games. What's also annoying is that there's no way to get cards out of your deck. On the trade pile it goes.

I can't speak to comparing this version to he the original, since it has been two years since I played it. While the changes made may be positive, I still did not enjoy playing this mess of a deck builder.

Being tasked with having to choose between dozens of cards, which to buy and add to your deck, is very daunting and frustrating for first time players. Why you have 2 separate decks to build is an added hassle and beyond me as to what it adds. Planning your discards is another needless layer to the game taking away from the meat.

I think the art is exceptional and the gameplay doesn't quite live up to it, although it is still very solid.  There seems to be a strong strategy in saving your resources and then just going for the higher value goods.  So, 10/10 for the art and components and 6/10 for the gameplay.

Like most euro's, this is a resource collection game (although with no resource spending), and playing the right action cards.  It was a little odd that you didn't get to use all the symbols on your cards.

Overall I though the artwork was great.  I'd play it again, but don't love it.  It was fine.

As all of Laukat's games, beautiful artwork that excites the senses. However, for some reason, I just can't get into his games. I've tried most, but the only 2 I justify owning/holding onto are this (City of Iron 2nd ed) & 8 Minute Empire Legends. City of Iron plays a bit too tightly, not much time to do what you would like, which is a shame since this world is an inviting one to explore.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (September 2017)

I have disliked every Ryan Laukat game I have played. They look great but they are rather light, with easy decisions and, in general, not fun to play. Due to this, I wasn’t expecting to like City of Iron: Second Edition, but I (kind of) do.

Reading the rules it seems like a complex game, but it really isn’t. I wish the rules were better structured. Once you understand them you can explain them under 11 minutes.

The art is pretty good, although I have never really liked this style. The game components are also good.

City of Iron: Second Edition is the first Ryan Laukat game that doesn’t bore me. It has many rules and many interesting decisions to make. It is a mix of deckbuilding and area control. The deckbuilding is novel because you have two different decks to build and draw from.  In each turn, players must do one action (build or store a card, draw a card from your decks, purchase science tokens, play a card from your hand or get money, attack a town ) and you repeat the process until every player has done 3 actions (which feel too few). Other interesting decisions are to decide how much money to spend on turn order and which cards to purchase so you can play them. 

I like that you never shuffle your decks, you only turn then and draw again. There is a memory element here that I like.

Each player control a nation that is a little different from the others.

On the bad side, It seems the game has multiple paths to victory, but I’m not sure if that’s true. Many of the cards you buy function in a similar way, also, you need to buy some of the cards or be left behind in critical areas. At the end of the game I felt it was a little repetitive, I hope it has enough replay value. 

I don’t know what are the differences between this one and the first edition. I hope they didn’t change the rules.

Best with 3 fast players. With four the downtime begins to bothers me.

Bottom line City of Iron: Second Edition is, by far, the best Ryan Laukat game I have ever played it (I still haven’t played Above and Below and I’m intrigued about it) and I want to play it again before deciding if I should sell it or not. It has interesting decisions and more to think than his regular games. The two deck system is novel and I like it.

2016-06-30 - After one 2-player game, I can only really say that this is a first impression and is probably not worth much. There's definitely enough going on that I need more than one play to really solidify my opinion. This game reminded me of Ascension, just because it's a deck builder with multiple currencies. The area control element, and the fact that you don't shuffle your deck both add interesting elements to the game.

2017-06-03 - My friend sold his copy, and I have no desire to pick up my own. I'm lowering my rating to a 6.

Another interesting design. Lauket makes a lot of designs where you want to be just ahead of the other players instead of aiming at static numbers. This usually results in a tense tug-of-war.

Art is fantastic. The different factions are different enough to feel thematic and incentivize you to go in certain direction. But not enough to unbalance the game or force you in a specific playstyle.

Good deck builder from one of my favorite designers. This game has players building two separate decks that don't shuffle discard piles when returning cards to play. This forces players to think about the order in which they play their cards with an eye towards future turns. Every card is available during buy rounds, which both opens up strategy and bogs down play at the same time. 

The four factions are unique and balanced and the game is drop-dead gorgeous, featuring Ryan Laukat's signature art style that never fails to impress.

My first play was kind of a disaster - my opponent was AP prone to begin with, and with all the different options for what card to add to their deck, it took about 3 hours for 2 players, which felt about twice as long as it should.

A second play with more decisive players was much, much better, though it still had a fairly steep learning curve for what is basically a midweight euro. I'm still undecided about how much depth and different strategies there are - I'll have to play more to find out.

What will go down as Ryan Laukat's magnum opus, in my opinion. He is a self-professed fan of Race for the Galaxy, and you can certainly see the influences here. This is a game of tableau-building with a little deck-building thrown in for good measure. The game can feel restrictive and a bit mechanical, but I enjoy the challenge of overcoming these obstacles. I still believe there is a bit of imbalance with the factions, but as long as you know that going in, the players can help ease this.

My 100th game played. Interesting game, with nice artwork. It felt a bit awkward when I played it, but this sensation may improve with more games.

I decided to sell it in the end. It is way too tight. You not only have a very restrictive amount of actions in the game, but you also have to spend a whole action to do the simplest things, like draw one card or get one coin. Also, for such constraint, I don't feel there are many strategies in this game. Overall, Laukat makes better stuff for sure.

It may seem superficial, but it cannot be understated how engaging the art is and how far it goes toward differentiating the streamlined but familiar gameplay. It's true that military seems to be the obvious strategy, but I need more plays to figure out if it can be counteracted by going heavy into buildings.

I thought this was a good game. It has a lot of replayability, and the characters are asymmetrical (barely).  There is very little confrontation with other players.  No "battles" against each other.  That said, you can take "towns" from each other, and there is intense jockeying for position on the goods tracks. You get extra money and, more importantly, victory points based on your rank on those good(s) tracks.  The unique part of the game is how you manage your "expert" cards.  When you use them, you discard them face-up in any order you choose.  When you need to draw, you flip the cards over and draw.  So, you're setting up your own decks.  Drawing cards is tough - there aren't that many opportunities.  But, you get to buy all the expert cards you want during the "Autumn" phase of each game round.  And, when you buy expert cards, they go directly into your hand.  I think that is clever.  And, it causes tension because, if you pay for expert cards, then you're spending the money that you need for building other parts of your city.

RATING: 7.5
[7.5] A wonderful hybrid game that mixes mid-heavy euro-style gameplay with deck building, light city building, and great art. 

PROS: (+9 stars)
+ Beautiful hand-drawn immersive game-art makes you want to jump into the world. 
+ High replay-ability due to several paths to victory, 4 different player decks, and each game feeling different than the last.
+ Depth of strategy - like chess, you can learn the base moves in one sitting, but the more you play the more you discover its depths.
+ Positive game tension: With only 7 rounds, a visual scoreboard, and the ability to fall hard from your high castle, this game keeps you strongly on your toes with an enjoyable amount of adrenaline.
+ Card drafting: While you start off with only a few cards, every card you purchase to add to your available deck is YOUR choice. You will rise or fall on your own proverbial sword based on your choices and decisions. I love this!
+ Comes with expansion pieces for game variety and leaves room for growth.

CONS: (-1.5 stars)
+/- The game is tight on money and tight on resources. To master this game, you will need to know the cards in your deck AND learn the "must have" cards in the A, B, and C decks. This means experienced players will often dominate new ones. I for one have no problem with getting better each time I play a game (even prefer it), however others have noted that the learning curve is a turn off.
-Player mats have been downgraded from thick cardboard to "thick paper" for second edition. It's not just that, but the "iron" theme is thinned as a result of removing the city-scape and player faction game art from player mats. Just to make it fit easier on the table? Hmmm. 
-Requires a solid amount of instruction to make sense of the card game symbology. Don't get me wrong, I've seen WAAAAAY worse, but it's not a game people can just jump into without 30 minutes of instruction. But once you get it, it makes complete sense.
-Cards literally disappear into your player mats because the discard and draw piles look EXACTLY like the cards you place on them; Again, it's a little thing, but makes a difference.
-There are 4 different competing tribes, each with their own banner, race, deck, and particular game advantage ... and barely a mention of their storylines or differences in the instruction book. Again, it's a little thing that goes a long way, and is a miss on the part of Ryan Laukat and Red Raven games.

SUMMARY: The clear strengths and amazing game-play off City of Iron (2nd Edition) FAR outweigh the weaknesses and nit-picky things I wish were different. If like me, you appreciate beautiful graphic design, depth of game play, positive game tension, and a little bit of a "take that" mechanism, you'll quickly fall in love with this game. Get it on your shelf, you won't regret it!

After some plays, the game shines, so I raise the rating from 7 to 8 :).

 After 9 plays I think that the game has some brilliant ideas, but it is not perfectly developed.It lack some elegance in some parts. So that's why I drop the rating to 7.

Solid engine builder game. Lots of bits and pieces to keep in mind during play. It's like everything ties into everything else, which at times can pull the rug under you; you finally bought the item you wanted to have in order for all the other pieces to click into place, only to realise you can't play that thing right now... 

The style is like some Neverending Story fantasy world, and as all Ryan Laukat's games, he really pulls me into this magical fantasy world. 

Solid 8+

City of Iron is a phenomenal area majority, deck management game. I like the changes to end game scoring, and the inclusion of the peaceful variant as an official variant. I don't think the attack dynamics work out very well in practice, but the game works beautifully without them, so it's not a big deal. I also like the option to upgrade your starting city. I think the game plays better 2 player with a dummy player on all of the goods at the 3 level, though that works better when playing without the steambots.

RATING: 7
Wavering between a 6 and a 7.  Didn't love it but I would play again now that I have a better grasp of the strategy.  

First-timers can take forever to figure out what's going on with this game, even experienced gamers.  And if you get in a game with a slow player it can be maddening.

But the art and theme are great and there's a ton going on, lots of decisions to be made, and lots of ways to win.  Lots of replayability as well.

This game is hard. There's rarely enough time or turns or science to complete what you want to complete. A player with a few games under their belt would have a distinct advantage over a new player, so that'd have to be kept in mind when teaching the game. We keep coming back to it because we feel like there's so much to wring out of the game and we only get a few drops each play. Jenny and I are both big fans of this one. We'd love to get one or two more broken in players.

Only one 2-player play so far. The wife and I enjoyed. Lots of little actions you can do. Two decks with multi use for each cards makes for interesting choices. The art on the cards is lovely, as Lauket's games always are. Not sure yet how much depth there is to this but I suspect a fair bit. I think Lauket's games are lovely and interesting but maybe not quite top grade as to clever mechanics. I think this game may be the exception to that. Needs more exploration.
Second game played, 3-player with kid also. We all enjoyed. Still a bit confused as to best strategy but beginning to see some depth of choices.

City of Iron has an interesting resource scoring system and a unique type of deck building.  The games feels very tight with limited money and actions, but I find the restriction fun.  The art is gorgeous, and the components are great.  Plus, it has tentacles as a resource!

------------------------------------
Just played the once, but this has some interesting mechanics with it having a general objective of getting majorities in a bunch of resources.

It has a sort of 'double deck builder' style, where you have civilians and military decks to get through, and you can advance both throughout the game.

Interested to play more, hope it holds up.

City of Iron: Experts and Engines 2nd Edition coming later in 2017. The expansion will consist only of a deck of cards, so no big box. Personal note: Need to play.

Original Kickstarter included: Goal Cards, Wooden Fraction Tokens instead of Cubes

RATING: 5.5
Intrigued, but first game was really rough. Not easy to pick up and learn. Will hold off rest of review and possible rating adjustment until I played a few more times.
Rest of review: Phew. Maybe I don't like it? It mixes a deck-building with city building, both used in unique ways, the concept of this sounds so good. But the execution does not seem to gel with me. 7 rounds with 3 turns each make for a very, VERY tight game, especially when a turn can be as little as drawing one card. A mistake therefor, can be severe. I also don't like how a bunch of things require you to play a very specific card (lands, upgrade districts etc.), again, if you mess up you get very limited in what you can do. 
To sum up, this tight play is obviously what some find exciting and what kills my fun. Maybe it gets better once I am perfectly familiar with the deck? For now, City of Iron frustrates me a lot.

I love the richness of the different paths to victory via the various characters that you hire and the economic and/or military strategies.  Works great as a two-player.  Player interaction is good as you anticipate what your opponent will do, attempt to frustrate his plans while progressing your own, and jockey for position in order to gain an edge each round in resource production (which leads directly to increased income and at three points of the game, victory points).  The military and citizen approaches seem balanced to me after a number of plays.  If one is indeed slightly stronger than the other, it would be easy to tweak via house rules (e.g., by giving slight influence point bonuses or penalties based on the number of towns acquired).  What I don't like is how there are so few actions each round and the things you need to progress (income and science) are so difficult to get.  I've house ruled this game fairly heavily so that it doesn't feel so confining (most notably by having 4 actions per turn instead of 3, and making the Draw, Research, and Tax actions more profitable/worthwhile relative to the other options), which greatly increases our enjoyment of the game.  My rating is based upon use of these house rules; without them, I'd rate the game a point lower.

At first blush, this is an AP machine: the deeper you get into the session, the more complex the game becomes. (It reminds me a bit of Macau -- or any other tableau builder, for that matter -- in that regard.) So don't play this with slow players.
But the mechanics are interesting and the choices are tough. At 21 actions for the entire game, you have to think hard before you use one to simply draw a card!
Looking forward to trying it again.

This is my girlfriend's and my favorite game of all time. It's a very tight and mechanically sound game. We are constantly trying new strategies, refining old ones, and doing our best to disrupt each other's. Whether we're focusing on different paths to victory or trying to outdo one another in the same path (military vs military for example), we always end up within 6 points or so of each other. We've also tied, having the wealthiest player win by tie-breaker!

I love games that give me choice. Every move is a critical choice in this game. How badly do you want to construct that factory? Is it worth NOT hiring that sharpshooter you desperately need so you have enough money to bid to go first? Or do you risk it?

Every game feels like I'm creating my own story as well. It's exciting to send an explorer and a small crew on an airship to a floating island. It's fun to figure out how you want to fund your military or scientific growth. Is your mayor honest or corrupt? Is your opponent an evil conqueror? Hire an arms dealer and put weapons in the hands of the people so that they can defend themselves!

I recommend giving yourself at least 3 hours for your first game. Also when introducing new players to the game. This will give you time to explore your decks for the first time, which is exciting, so don't rush it! Our games typically run 2 hours or less now.

I could go on and on about this game, but I'll stop there before I write an essay. Basically, I really like it. A lot.

Wow this game is heavy the firs time. Nothing like other Laukat games (medium to easy euros).

It´s a city building ... not really
It´s a deckbuiling ... not really
It´s an area control ... not really
It´s a engine builder ... not really
It´s a little bit of all those things, with a card management and combo system very cool ala Mombasa (Kind of)

It´s a devourer of tables, but when the game is finished you can contemplate the beautiful art in the cities you created, it evokes a rich theme although its a "dry" euro in the end.

RATING: 9
The crunchiest of the three Red Raven Games I own (Above and Below, Islebound). This is a game with a high learning curve that will punish you for getting the progression wrong, but reward you for doing it right.  Really requires a couple of play throughs for most players.  And that's what I like the most about it.  Every decision is supremely important.

RATING: 6
It has a special kind of charm for the ol' grognards that remember simulationist games with a ton of charts!  It's like rolling up a character... for 4 hours.

RATING: N/A
Excellent game for an afternoon at the club when I'm three-quarters dead and thus even more incapable of new strategies in [i]Dark Valley[/i]. An 'experience' game. We seemed to have some trouble with the Fair Sex rules. Agree with all the other comments here: it does what it is very well, but there's little requirement for deep thought. The game kept sending me to the Rhine, XI Corps or Portugal, so it looks like it rated me a 2 as a Marshal's baton prospect!

When you feel the sound of history pulsing inside you, you're living history, you are making history. And when it's fun, full of duels, lady's, let's get an horse, draw the sword and Charge!!
All other things are details, small details

RATING: 8
You are a soldier in Napoleons Army. It's card driven and the artwork is just gorgeous. It has many many facets that make your character come to life: attributes, titles, commands, wifes, mistresses, duels, offices, corruption. It plays very smooth after you worked through the unnecessarily complicated rulebook, even solitaire. Atmosphere is fantastic.

Great theme, great stories come from this and as I really like the napoleonic period this is a great game. Not quite a 10 as the rules could be laid out a bit better and each player could have a player aid to place markers rather than use a log sheet.

This is B-17/B-29 for Napoleonic enthusiasts. Very much a simulation (though not a simulation of specifically war), but still entertaining. My rating is based off of solo play, so it probably deserves 1-2 more point when playing with other people, and integrating things such as the fairer sex, gambling, and dueling. Very much in the vein of Barbarian Prince or Tales of the Arabian Nights as comparisons for non-wargamers.

I think this game is perfect. Simple to learn and yet so detailed. It is especially brilliant for developing a story as your characters do through the wars of the Napoleonic age. I love the Napoleonic age and have gained lots more detailed information from playing th game. Love it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely fun, but the rules are not well organized, being optimized for neither learning nor reference (IMO).

Slightly lacking as a solitaire game as well due to a complete lack of suggestions on what should constitute victory.  But then, I think the game is really intended to be played almost more as an interactive novel/role-playing experience than as a competitive game....

RATING: 8
Thematic, rich experience game where you play the life of a soldier of Napoleon, rising through the ranks.  Takes a bit to get it flowing, but rewarding when you get there.

I had an entertaining time with this, but its not for everyone. Its closest relative is probably Tales of Arabian Nights, but driven by four card decks rather than a book of paragraphs. The cards are mostly event names and stats or targets to beat on a d10 roll so you have to write the details in yourself. This is fine but i wonder at the replay value. It is a very unique experience and possibly worth it for that alone.

Here's a game in the vein of B-17 or The Hunters. I say game but really Legion of Honor can't deserve the title. You draw a card, read it, sometimes roll a dice, look at a chart, and update your stats. Oftentimes you don't even roll and just update your stats. That's pretty much it. I wanted to like it, for its theme and its interesting perspective on the Napoleonic wars, which are usually told from the commander perspective. But let's face it; with extremely limited decisions to make, no tension, and not even clear victory conditions, this game is just a waste of time. Plus it's uselessly fiddly and convoluted and the rule book really doesn't help. I'm even more bummed because the art is really nice and you can tell that the designers put a lot of effort in conveying the historical events. Even the French language is flawless as far as I can tell. I have only played solo so I can't speak about the multi player but regardless I don't see myself ever playing it again. I recommend avoiding this game, which on top of that is pretty expensive. I was really looking forward to it but it is a major disappointment.

Tales of the Arabian Nights meets Napoleon. As with games of this sort you're in for the experience, a sort of simulation of life as a Grognard. Good for an evening with wargamers that want to play something very, very different, for a change.

Despite the amazing theme, it looks like a Choose Your Own Adventure without the choose part. A shame. I'd even try it solo to confirm, were it not for the travesty of a rulebook.

I salute the designers for the level of historical detail and fidelity they've managed to squeeze in here (and it looks the part too) but LoH is, essentially, a simulator on rails rather than anything that could really be described as a game.

Players will have few meaningful decisions to make (beyond a certain amount of push your luck) and the best decision will in any case generally be quite obvious.
The system is also heavily luck dependant and it's quite possible to die unexpectedly and unavoidably at almost any point - you can restart as another character but that's likely to be scant consolation if you happen to be well into the game.

How much this is likely to appeal is therefore largely dependant on one's interest in learning about and / or exploring Napoleonic military history from a French perspective in a semi-interactive fashion (and, I have no doubt, on the willingness of all participants to roleplay their characters).

In terms of game play, it's a little weak and nothing special.  However, it's immersive as hell and pretty much becomes a pseudo-RPG where a pretty cool backstory emerges.  I wouldn't want to play it too many times back to back but I have alot of fun while playing it.

Rated 8, based on a single (long) and rollicking session with 4 players. Dripping with theme, rich in detail, very high quality in terms of design and physical components (although somebody at CoA is somewhat overly fond of script fonts, IMO). This is more of an epic narrative or an experience than a game; one does get a real sense of the whims of fate as history sweeps the battlefields, and you flips your cards and takes your choices. The scale is as small as it can get - a single man navigating his career as an officer. An RPG wargame if ever there was such an animal. Not sure how it will bear up under repeated play, but I'll enjoy finding out.

After a video review: Seems to have very unique and interesting mechanics not seen in other games before. For making story telling game, there is a lot of potential in there.

But the game has really few strategic decisions. The game plays the game for you, and the worst part it's since it's an historical game, every game it's more than likely to happen almost the same way, so the replay value is very thin.

This game surprised me. Its a card given game that builds a solid historical narrative around the life of an individual. Portraying not only battle events, but garrison life and social life. Throw that in with some social interaction. Offend your opponent and he can challenge you to a duel!

Game play consists of card draws, with each individual must act on the card, or, if given a choice, choose from a range of options. As the reward increases, so the risk increases. If you want to add substantially to the game then bring along attitude as there is very much room in the game for a role-playing element!

Each player keeps track of 10 characteristics, of which only 4 are used to determine victory. Yet the other characteristics are instrumental in achieving victory. The game works with 1-6 players yet I suspect that it could be played with more. The optimum number for best game involvement would probably be 3-5, however it is working very well in my current two-player game!

I was hooked after the first two rounds of cards. The first providing the option of visiting the boudoir of a lady from the Bonaparte family, the second challenging me to a duel! Did Napoleon find out about the dalliance? That is for me to know.....

Started a 3 player game last night. First card drawn: "A test of manhood". How many other games out there provide the option of proving your manhood in a drinking contest?

Update: The game provides an option for players to join at any time. We put this to the test last session, with the 4th player joining the game at the beginning of campaign season 6. All went smoothly and he is now making his mark on the game - mostly via duels.
I found that the game has also mirrored real life. I proposed in game to Brigitte and all she did was laugh at me.  Sigh.

On a personal note, I find the rules work well. It is very logically structured, following the flow of the core game chart. This makes in game issues very easy to resolve.

If you pretend you really are a man on the French army of the era, you will like it. The event cards are nicelly illustrated and it reconstructs the feeling of the period. But it is pure luck with little decision making and needs some hours to get the picture of it.

RATING: 6
This is basically B-17, but replaces individual planes with individual soldiers.  Given that premise, it is actually far more interesting than B-17.  Your soldier is rated in eight different categories and is faced with challenges while training, while on campaign, or even during battle.  You can get involved in duels, court ladies, get captured, and get promoted to grand marshall.  But your decision making is few and far between.  You are mostly subject to random card draws and die rolls which will dictate a intricate story for your soldier.  This is satisfying for what it is, but for such a process oriented game play, you would think the rules would be better.  Without the need to communicate difficult choices to a game player, I am surprised on how much rule book flipping is necessary to get through this game.

Enjoyed my first few plays of this solitaire. Did what it promised, with perhaps a bit too much number-crunching.

Then I played it two-player with a buddy, and fell IN LOVE. This absolutely shines with someone to share in the rich, thrilling slice of history it drops you in the center of.

After repeated plays this has made my [b]Twenty Games to Keep List[/b] 

Just a fantastic story-telling engine and honestly, more than any other title in my collection, this is one that I am [i]always[/i] in the mood to play.

I've played this game extensively solo (see the sessions on Jean Francois Hebert) and once in a marvelous four-hour game with two retired Lt. Colonels. In each case, Legion of Honor was compelling and a great deal of fun. Decisions are made, especially regarding transfers and combat. The second and third-order effects of said decisions play out, sometimes with nostalgic turns and other with great regret. The game is NEVER not engaging. It's a nuanced experience, one that rings true to the Napoleonic era and the aspirations of French soldiers, captured so well in the game's title.

In order to love this game (as we do) you must have a group of players that like story driven experiences.  Our group is fun like that so this game provided countless opportunities for French army banter.

This game is heavy on FATE, so don't expect to "win" it by your wits alone.

Difficult to rate. The mechanics are pretty awful, unnecessary fiddly and mired in the early 80s response to the popularity of D&D. And yet... the narrative hooks are substantial. It might be worth playing a couple times solo or in small groups, but you do lose something of the camaraderie and bluster.

Not your ordinary Napoleonic card game and certainly not what I expected.  Immersive playing from an individual soldier's perspective.  But, the rules are a train wreck. There's a good game in there if you can get someone who's played it to teach you. Poor quality shading on the cards as well.  About half the brown Campaign cards have a slightly lighter/darker back color than the other half, enough to be noticeable.

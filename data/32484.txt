Cool little game for a quick card-based battle.
I sense but am not sure I have completely found the hidden depths of this game.  But then I've only played 3 times.

RATING: 8
A very under-rated game. It is a quick, tactical game for two-players. The strategies of this game evolve the more you play it. Don't get too focused on the WWII theme; it is a minor part of the game. The publisher and designer are active on BGG.

It's a theme pasted on to a card game, but I like the interactions and quick play.  If it went on for 2 hrs, it would unbearable, but for a quick 10 minute game, it's enjoyable and having combat pictures on it is more thrilling than the 10 of clubs.

RATING: 5.5
The card play is simple and it boils down to correct card played at the correct time to get that card advantage over your opponent.

The theme could be anything as it makes little difference.

The cards are well made and glossy. But the card images are limited and similar on both sides. Much theme lost with M4 shooting at M4s.

RATING: 8
Simple, addictive and I suck at it. A card placement game that very abstractly shows a battle between armies.

To place a card it must be able to trace supply back to the army's base.If it is able to it can destroy the opponents card - often it requires the support of another card already placed to achieve this.

You win by getting a card into your opponent's home base (legally of course) or by having more forces on the board when the decks run out.

Ενδιαφέρον καρτοπαίχνιδο για 2 άτομα, με απλούς κανόνες και γρήγορο ρυθμό. Οι παίκτες έχουν όμοιες τράπουλες και προσπαθούν να καταλάβουν την βάση του αντιπάλου. Κάθε κάρτα κατεβαίνει μόνο σε θέση από όπου μπορεί να παίρνει supply από την φιλική βάση. Χρησιμοποιούμε δηλαδή ένα νοητό grid για την θέση των καρτών. Με το που κατέβει η κάρτα αμέσως επιτίθεται προς την κατεύθυνση που μπορεί και μετά παρέχει support στις επιθέσεις των άλλων unit.

Υπάρχουν διάφορες μονάδες σε κάθε τράπουλα και κάθε μονάδα έχει την δική της κατεύθυνση για επίθεση, υποστήριξη και τροφοδοσία. Ο κάθε παίκτης έχει επίσης και 2 κάρτες Airstrike οι οποίες απλά καταστρέφουν όποια αντίπαλη κάρτα θέλεις. :devil: Οι κανόνες λοιπόν είναι αρκετά απλοί αλλά ταυτόχρονα προσφέρουν ενδιαφέρουσες επιλογές στους παίκτες. 

Αντί για artwork οι κάρτες έχουν ασπρόμαυρες φωτογραφίες από τον δεύτερο παγκόσμιο πόλεμο. Προσωπικά θα προτιμούσα να είχε κανονικό artwork αλλά καταλαβαίνω πως κάτι τέτοιο θα αύξανε το κόστος. :(

Γενικά είναι ένα πολύ καλό και γρήγορο fillerάκι. Απλά δεν έχει τα εντυπωσιακά γραφικά για να τραβήξει την προσοχή των casual/non-gamer. :p

Fun little filler game that doesn't take too long and seems to have enough strategy to be enjoyable.  I'm under the opinion that the second player has a huge advantage in the game, but I could be wrong.  Also, the game always seems to involve a special forces guy going for the win (maybe intended).  It's a pretty fun game, but I think it actually would get old pretty quick.

Protip: don't get taught this as a "draw 2 cards, play 1 card" game unless you like stalemates :-)  With the correct rules, as verified by the tough-to-me Java AI app, I think it's a fantastic and quick little game.  I think it's one of the more interesting abstract themings out there.  I get how people could say it's not really war, but I think the unit implementations are surprisingly well-themed in the way they work.  I think it's a steal at $8 or whatever, and totally recommend it to anyone that's taking the time to read comments about it (like this one).

Little bit of a learning curve to this game.  I like the artwork, and the fact that it's a 5 minute filler.  I think I've got a ways to go on getting the strategy down though.  Rating may go up with more plays.  I think that the theme works pretty well, and is not quite as pasted on as others think.

I was a bit surprise by BBG lack-luster rating of this game, considering how innovating it is. But I suspect that has a lot to do with it playing like chess. If you like spatial-awareness games and looking for a quick, simply to learn game with depth... this is something you certainly should buy. 

Lots of replayability and love how the designer managed to limit luck in a card game. Furthermore, the theme actually works really well with the game (rarity for abstract-like games) and it is dirt cheap.

I really like Battle for Hill 218! Unfortunately, my GF and her 10 year old son did not enjoy it so much.

RATING: 7.25
Card game with strong positional mechanic. Placing cards allows you to 'attack' enemy cards; point is to flank a central "hill 218" card. Buildign networks of support goign forward is important, and recognising the strength of each card type (infantry, artillery, tank, paratroopers, special forces) is the key to unlocking a win. The different strengths of each card and the positional element make the game surprisingly deep, but it plays insanely fast. It would be a great warm-up for a more serious wargaming night.

War from an abstract filler point of view. I didn't liked it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
A simple 2p card-based war game of luck and tactics.  Each cards represents a particular type of unit with certain attack and support relationships relative to adjacent cards/units.  Most units attack, trace a supply line, or provide support orthogonally, but a few do so diagonally (most notably the special forces unit which is the only unit that can obtain support diagonally).  Cards can only launch an attack at the moment that they are placed and only if they have the required support (crosshairs) from adjacent cards/units.  A few units (tanks and artillery) can attack without support and can be useful clear space and break through the enemy line.  The special forces unit can also be very effective for breaking through since they can trace supply lines diagonally.  The critical space is the enemy base located directly behind the hill card, and the special forces can provide a quick means to reach and occupy that space for the win.  It's a clever tug-of-war, filler game considering that it's just a small deck of cards, but it's not a game that I feel excited about or compelled to purchase.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've played the computer variant, which has kicked my tail a number of times. This convinced me to buy the card game, which is a really fast playing fun filler. 

There's a definite killer move strategy to win the game, but if you save up the cards that you need to pull it off, then you have less scope to build the position you need to launch the final attack.

What a great 2-player game!  Definitely has a "chess-light" feel to it.  It can boil down to battling for just 3 key positions on the grid, but there are enough interesting combos with the 2-action turns to let you push for a win regardless.  As a fast, strategic 2-player game this is far more fun than Hive in my opinion. I am definitely picking this one up.

Feels a bit dry - but works as a puzzle type game. Get your starting hand and try to work out how to beat your opponent. Helps if you can card count (so you have an idea what cards your opponent has near the game end). Theme works - units do pretty much what you'd expect. Would prefer it if there was more variety and also an asymmetric mix (ie. different decks). Haven't played it enough to be sure, but seems going first is a disadvantage.

An excellent little abstract card game. The rules are simple, can be explained fairly quickly, but yield complex games. There are a few "gotcha" strategies (Air Strike + Special Forces FTW!), but after you fall for those once the game settles down into a tense little battle. And it plays fast, so after you're done with Hill 218, you can do 219, 220, and probably get to Hill 223 or so before the hour is up.

RATING: 6.5
Juego de cartas para dos jugadores en los que ambos se enfrentan por dominar una carta central. El objetivo es eliminar la carta del contrario que está justo detras de la colina. Para ello, se sirve de las características de cada carta (suministro, daño y apoyo). Está basado en la colocación estratégica de las cartas para lograr tu objetivo.

Juego rápido (15 m) y sin grandes pretensiones.  Solo he echado una partida hasta la fecha, insuficiente para que mi valoración sea considerada como definitiva.

Basically an abstract game, much like Hive. Knowing all the units' powers (there aren't that many) is crucial. The mechanics are simple enough that very quickly you learn a few killer "combos" that you try to implement -- or prevent, as you see them developing. I enjoyed this a great deal, though my wife was less taken. Also, each game takes maybe 5-10 minutes.

While I wasn't really expecting to like this game a heck of a lot, it turned out to be a pretty dang good and quick little two-player game!  Plenty of angst as you try to anticipate what your opponent is capable of doing, and challenging to arrange your cards in a way to make an attack opportunity on your opponent's side of the hill.  Fun times!

I originally put this as a 6 after many plays against computer.  Those plays are mearly ways to get more proficient at the game, the real fun is playing F2F.  Played with my borther in law who loves all things WWII.  We really enjoyed it.  

The fact that each game is super fast also adds to the awesomeness that is Battle for Hill 218.  A must for everyone.  I always have my deck in my pocket (if you ever see me, and you have 10 minutes.. we can play!)  

Upgraded to an 8 after playign with Mike.  (11/27/09)

This is an absolutely clever game that pits the luck of the draw with your ability to select the best combo moves. The best way to learn is to play the online version which is free. Only then, (by playing over 150 online games) can one eventually pick up and develop an insurmountable strategy that will quickly demolish any opponent. Fortunately, the online games only take 5 minutes to play, so multiple plays will give you instant gratification and eventually the ability to beat the "hard" setting most of the time. This is by far one of the quickest strategic card games I have ever come across. What a wonderful game!

[u]December 2008:[/u] Tremendous game, very tactical with a wee bit of strategy.
Fast and furious!

Really cheap and great card quality.

A must have!

[u] May 2009: [/u]

I said the game wasn't very strategic. I guess I was kind of wrong, I was going to say that, if it didn't have management, it certainly had deck management... well yeah, I mean, keeping cards now for later uses, not clogging my hanf with too powerful cards. Well this is technically strategy so I guess the game does show a bit of strategy... Not much, but long-term considerations are there(well as uych long term as there could be in a 10m game...)
I would rate it a lot higher, but for a 10 minute game, I can't really do that...

But this is undoubtedly a beautiful game with great replay value.

Ok, so the theme is stretched thin, ok, it could be an abstract...
But hey, name me just one other game with so much tactical decisions with so much replay value, so portable, cheap and intense... I can't think of another. I also think it would appeal to any kind of player.

I picked up a copy today and played four games with my eight year old when he got home from school.  This game is like Hive for wargamers.  I quite like it.  The card quality is good and there are some fun choices to be made.  Calling air strikes is always a good time, and it teaches n00bs like myself about supply lines.

update: I must have played this 7-8 times today.  My dad, who used to play a lot of poker, likes it and my matches with clever eight-year-old are now more even.  Best ten bucks I have ever spent on a game, I think.  Except for those $5.00 copies of second edition Hive.  But *close*.

Purchased this game because my son loves the WWII theme and I've seen it recommended by many here on BGG.  Good, light abstract that from what I've read, has deeper strategy than I've discovered so far in 3 plays.  Plays quickly, and it's a great game to pack along when my son and I need to kill some time.  Looking forward to trying the online version.

A fine game for what it is. Two players joust for military dominance. Unfortunately the alternate (that is, common) win condition is very oddly implemented. I really want this game to actually be about ``taking the d*** hill,'' but it isn't. Another detractor is the randomness of the card draw, I feel like I would want to play this game with the following (untried) variant rule:

[i]When drawing cards, draw one extra and then immediately bury a card from your hand.[/i]

Short rules summary
-------------------------
The “Battle for Hill 218 (short BfH218)“ is a 2-player-card-game which simulates the battle for the eponymous hill in World War II. The game itself takes place on an imaginery grid which forms around Hill 218- which is basically just a card you put on your table during setup. 

Each player starts the game with an identical set of 26 unit- and two airstrike-cards. After shuffling the 26 unit-cards and arranging them as a draw-pile, each player draws five unit-cards from his pile and discards two of them by placing them under their draw-pile. Now the players take alternating turns.

On a turn, each player first draws two unit-cards from the draw-pile and then plays two cards from their hand (Exception: On the very first turn of BfH218, you can only draw and play one card). In order to play a card, the player has to put it into an unoccupied and supplied space of the imaginery grid. A space of the grid is considered supplied, when there is an uninterrupted line of unit-cards from the bottom of the Hill-Card (the so called “base”) to the chosen grid-space. Normally this means, that a player can put down a unit-card into the grid-space horizontally or vertically adjacent to one of their already played unit-cards as long as this unit-card is still supplied. Well, there are two exceptions to this rule: The Paratrooper-unit-card can be put in any unoccupied space of the grid, the Special Forces-unit-card can be put down into any grid-space diagonally adjacent to a supplied unit-card. 

After putting down a card, a player can perform the attack printed on the card. While a tank or the artillery can directly remove an adjacent unit-card of the opposing player, most other unit-cards need support from already played unit-cards in order to destroy an opposing unit-card. One important thing to remember is that each unit-card can only attack when it is played. Afterwards, it can only support newly placed unit-cards.

Additionally, each player receives two airstrikes-cards which can be played instead of a unit-card. An airstrike enables the player to destroy an arbitrary opposing unit-card on the table.

The game continues until one player manages to put a unit-card into the enemy’s base or no player has any more unit- or airstrike-cards in their hands. In the latter case, the player with the most remaining unit-cards on the table wins.

Comments
--------------
* BfH218 is basically an abstract card-placing-game which reminds me strongly of Hive. You place cards in order to get closer to your enemies base and once you are within reach, you conquer it. Some of your thoughts should thereby be spent on developing a good supply and support for future turns. Like in Hive, you can only place your unit-cards next to your own unit-cards. So you have to keep a good balance between attacking your opponent and securing your “infrastructure”.

* Somehow the theme of BfH218 is more believable than the theme of Hive. I guess, this is because the abilities of the unit-cards nicely match the abilities of the real-world models. For example: The artillery-unit can attack unit-cards that are far away and the Paratroopers can be placed everywhere. 

* The game plays fast and is a nice filler which, like Hive, forces you to make a lot of decisions in it’s short playing-time. In this respect it would be a nice addition to my collection. But until now I couldn’t find a copy in germany and I’m afraid that the theme might put of most of my gaming-friends.

* In contrast to Hive there is some luck introduced to the game through the drawing of the unit-cards. Since I have only played a couple of games, I can’t really say how much impact the card draw has. But I suspect, the better player will win more often.

This is, as someone rather aptly put it, a war driven card game - but do not despair if you're not into wargames, this could have easily been an abstract; in fact, the game TBFH 218 reminds me of the most is actually Hive. And there could scarcely have been a better compliment.  On the other hand, if you are into wargames, this game also somehow manages to convey the feeling of a battle to the players. A brilliant game!

Two player abstract card game where players are deploying forces and attempting to take their opponents base. Simple game where players on their turn draw two cards and deploy two cards to the "map", an expanding grid of cards anchored on the Hill 218 card. Cards are units, which have abilities for supply (where can they deploy), attack (where can they attack, and do they auto defeat?), and support (who can they help in combat). Simple mechanically, perhaps too simple. Found it a bit bland, with the start player totally controlling the tempo of the game. Obviously need to play more to see what I am missing.

Very impressed. Hive with a military theme that feels like a light wargame at the same time. Well, more of a skirmish. And it feels like one too. The units also behave like in real life (or what I imagine of it because I never fought in a war myself): a tank punches a hole through the enemy, artillery soften up the enemy from a distance, special forces infiltrate into enemy territory, etc.

I really wanted to like this one, especially with the price tag. It seems like each player needs a dozen games down before it would become interesting.

Not much happening, not much desire to replay and get to the point of making this game interesting.

Cool little game, plays quickly.  Unfortunately we've gotten "good" enough at the game that nobody will ever win by base capture, resulting in a boring war of attrition that I invariably lose because I play aggressively.

The design is solid, and it's a decent way to fill some time, but it lost a lot of its appeal once we got to the point that base captures don't happen.

I read some of the design history of the game, and I'm probably just in the "wrong" part of the learning curve right now, but I'm not too interested in continuing to play a game just because I'm not good enough at it yet to properly enjoy it.

Quick, quality card game with short rules.  Fits in my pocket, so take anywhere.  The incorporated supply line reminds me of a very glorified & sophistocated tic-tac-toe.  We played the first two games incorrectly, like a lot of others-read the thread here http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/365032 to make sure "support" is used correctly.  

Unfortunatley for me there is a very strong memory element to the game that is crucial to playing the game to its best.  The computer version remembers for you.

After one play I'm ready to rate this one. Fantastic! Like Airwar: Pacific its a card game not a battle sim but the way the different unit types affect the deployment of cards is very thematically consistent with a sim. My one *BIG* complaint - the artwork. Electing to make both sides a combination of German/Japan and US/Brit photography was a mistake in my opinion. Please guys, next printing spring for segregated printing, I for one would stand in line to buy another deck. Otherwise; a 10 for the ages.

Used to be my favorite quick two-player game back in 2009. I just moved it from a 10 to an 8. This game is quick, spatially deep, and has manageable elements of risk. All of these elements are perfectly balanced. A great game. Can be a little tense to play, not the ultimate casual game. 

The mechanics are too counter-intuitive to teach easily though, and it rewards skill to the point where I would probably win the first twenty games against a smart new player before they could match me. 

Field of Glory, the card game by Martin Wallace, is my new favorite two player game because of its better execution on theme, it's interesting drafting and the narrative that that develops, more intuitive mechanics, and more casual play-style. 

Purchased in 2009. Took it from a 10 to a 7 in 2014 due to Field of Glory.

Finally had a chance to pick this one up. I really had no idea what to expect from it! When I started playing my first game, I still didn't know what to make of it! By the middle of my second game I saw the possibilities of this very succinct, quite abstract tactical game of laying cards down on a grid. Three things to consider: deploying, attacking, and supporting - and each one of these aspects is easy to understand and makes for some interesting decisions.

A year later, I'm done with this game.  Doesn't really create excitement. The cards are too similar to keep the game interesting and the tactics are a little too straightforward.  Sort of comes down to luck by the end if both players are playing at similar levels.

This was a nice little card game that I had been wanting to try for a while. It's roughly themed around the idea of armies competing for control of a particular hill in a battle. In reality, it had much more of the feel of an interesting card game with the war theme tacked on. That's not a bad thing, just different from my expectations. It was very light and very quick, and fun enough for what it was. I don't know why I was expecting more, but it was good enough for what it was.

I'm not a huge WWII guy in general, but it's a great theme here--- very cool card graphics and the pairing of supply and attack capabilities blend really well.

Artillery feels like artillery, infantry like infantry, and there's nothing finer than dropping that tank card on whatever's dug-in in front of it.

Solo-gaming factor:  high.

Thank you Secret Santa 2008!

Plenty of tactical possibilities, surprisingly for such a small game. Ultimately, only a few strategies really promise a victory, but the journey to finding those includes quite some detours - and I'm not proficient in actually implementing them yet at all. So, you'll easily get enough plays out of this one to justify the price of the box.

It's in the Mail - a present from Bractrain5 ( for the Crack head Fire relief program ).  I just found this in my suit case from last year, it looks great, need to try it out.  Got in 2 games of it, I found it Ok, but I may be missing some strategy, seems like a lot of ties will come of it?  Feb. 17th or so I changed from 7.6 to 8.6, this game just rocks, it is so fun.  SO So much strategy, I like it more the more I play it.  Bought another for $3 in an auction, cause the old one is so so beat up - got to use it at BGF 2014 with MAtt and against Tom

Essentially an abstract tile-laying game that comes as a pack of cards. Plays quickly once you've gone over the rules and is a nice change of pace from all the games that feel like you could play them with a normal deck of cards (I'm looking at you Battle Line, Lost Cities, Court of the Medici, etc).

The two colors -- blue and green -- are too close. They serve no purpose other than to distinguish sides so why not pick colors that are dead simple to tell apart?

Some small improvements of the cards would be nice: after playing Archaeology: The Card Game I've become convinced that nearly all cards games should include on-the-card info showing distributions. I don't play Battle for Hill 218 often enough to remember how many Special Forces there are in a deck but that kind of card counting can be important for your end game strategy.

I think there's a place for light, war-themed card games, but I don't think this one's a winner. This is an entirely abstract, shape-driven game with play determined entirely by random draw (a larger hand size might be a useful house rule, but I haven't tried it). Incidentally, "Battle for Hill xxx" reminds me of the Korean War, so why is this covered with WWII pictures? It could have been so much better themed.

Jul08: Well that went over like a lead rock with my wife.  I didn't realize just how much she disliked the military themes.  The game also has some rather difficult concepts for something that seems so simple.  I almost think it's better in the Java version playing against the AI.

The game is very close to an abstract.  The only luck is the draw of the cards, but you're both going to see your whole deck at some point.

The actual game is interesting.  As others have said, it's a game about taking the initiative and keeping it.  After playing the AI a bunch, it also seems to be about drawing your big guns early, which takes a little bit of the fun out of it.

In the end, it's not bad, but I think Go does the same thing better.

A pretty cool little filler for 2 players, the theme was a nice fit but the game is really an abstract quite similiar to Hive.  

I found the "ceiling" came quite fast as here your "base" can not move and this limits the game somewhat making strategies feel samey fairly quickly. Comparing to Hive those pieces also have a little more subtle movement, comparing to something like Dvonn there is no comparison, same time but Dvonn's depth blows both the other games mentioned out of the water (all 3 play in about 15 - 25 minutes). 

I like the "Air strikes" which give you some much needed flexibility but overall being a card game the draw is probably a little too important.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2010)

Last time I  played The Battle for Hill 218 was more than 5 years ago. This has two consequences. 1. I don’t remember much about the game nuances, I remember it was a very light game so I don’t think I would like it today as my gaming tastes have changed so much in this period of time. 2. I don’t have any desire to play the game.

I’m downgrading its rating to a 6.0,  The Battle for Hill 218 is a borderline game for me, its main appeal is that it plays so fast.
 
If and when I play the game again, I will come back to re comment

Current Rating: 6.0

Abstracts aren't my favorite type of game but I'd rather play this than most others out there.  Hill 218 is a perfectly acceptable way to spend 15 minutes - seems broken on first glance but isn't really.  Well themed.

A great abstract military themed filler paced game.

I always have it in the car and I can't say that about many games (It's extremely portable, and the cards are very thick).

This, and Hive, are great games for playing at a pub.

Reminds me some of Court of the Medici (one of my all-time favorite games) with the card laying aspect to knock out cards (military units) of your opponent.  It plays in less than 15 minutes so it can be very addicting.  I've only played on the iPad.

B218 is a quick WW2 game that mimics supply line management whilst protecting your base and attacking your opponents. The game is good for what it is but sadly I find little interest in the theme or the implementation of the mechanics. 

I would recommend this to WW2 folks who want something quick and light that they can play with a buddy who won't play one of those long, deep war games they have sitting lonely on the shelf.

Gave it as a gift to Josiah (turned 9).

After four plays, I've warmed up to The Battle for Hill 218. At first it seemed like straightforward tit-for-tat conflict: you deploy two units on your turn, and if you successfully destroy two of your opponent's units, you're well on your way to victory. But Hill 218 is short and sweet (plays in 15m), and once you get a feel for the cards there is a fair amount of maneuvering to be done here. In my last game I was pleasantly surprised by the dynamic shape of my supply lines, and enjoyed setting up powerful moves for my next turn. Really, what the designer has done here is created an ideal introduction to maneuvering games ("like chess or go," as the box says). The limited scope of the tactics engages me at the right level, and will perhaps sharpen my play in deeper tactical wargames. If you know what to expect going in, there's no reason not to own this.

Another underrated and overlooked 2p game that plays fast and has great depth. When people start talking about Lost Cities, Battle Lines, and Balloon Cup (reprinted as Pinata) this is one of the games I mention as another 2p game to consider. The difference is that (a) Hill 218 plays much faster, (b) has much greater depth, and (c) has a theme and style of interaction that will turn off casual players but will appeal to certain kinds of gamers..

I have yet to encounter a 2p game that takes under 15 minutes with this kind of depth, strategy, and replayability.

After a hundred plays, roughly three quarters of them against the AI on the iOS version, I am still learning how to play well. It's one of the best 2p games I own, the depth-to-length ratio is really high, and I always take a copy with me to game nights. My estimation of the game has only grown.

I highly recommend the iPad version. When you're learning the game, the AI (which has three levels), is difficult. It shouldn't take you long to beat the easy AI. It took me about 50 plays before I could consistently beat the normal AI (I'm a slow learner), at which point I won 18 games in a row. The hard AI is a bigger challenge. A great way to get good at the game.

RATING: 8
Quick (~ 15 min), some light thinking required, thematic.

Schotten-Totten and 2 de Mayo are way more tense, for me.  The back-and-forth nature of Hill 218 "cleans up" a good part of the board (or at least the most strategic parts) many times during a game, which makes BfH218 quite a tactical game.  I miss the strategy and the multiple open fronts of Schotten-Totten and 2 de Mayo.

I also prefer Hive, where strategy is more important, and where the board situation evolves is a richer way.

What I may miss: variety (as in the variety of cards in Netrunner, or the variety of possible strategies in Race for the Galaxy, or the various cards in Agricola), depth.

However, this is a nice little filler.

This is an odd little two player game of simple card placement. Each player has a small number of cards, placement rules are pretty simple, and games are over fairly quickly.

Hill 218 is an easy game to learn how to play. It is more difficult to master. Since Hill 218 is card based it is highly portable and a good choice to carry when one is traveling. Hotel room tables are big enough to support a game. Hill 218 is a game which does not take long to play which makes it a good choice when one does not have several hours to play a game.

I only played one game recently so my rating may be unfair at this point. I would play it again to see if it makes a better impression on me. It was ok for a fast card game but I think I would rather play something like Jambo which I really think is a fun card game.

RATING: 3
2 / 5 - Fair.

Surprising depth here for such a simple and quick game and at heart, that's the appeal here. The apparent military theme is a bit of a shame - it's mirrored in the gameplay not at all beyond the sense that you're gradually "outflanking" an opponent - this is really an abstract.

RATING: 7
Clever, insanely simple... should probably be called "the battle for swamp 218" or "crevasse 218" (because of the inability to occupy the hill)... but i really like this game.

Not deep, but makes up for it in other respects.

Only played against a computer AI, but think this game is wonderful.  Definitely agree with the designer that different strategies will come up over and over again.  Card variety will definitely mean that all strategies won't work all the time so there's definitely a level of improvisation involved in the game...  May wind up higher than 8.5; but with it being such a quick game to play, it can get familiar/stale quickly.

Very nicely made small game.  The computer version always kicks my butt.  Other players don't.  But there's something I'm missing in my strategy because I'm generally being dominated and only win if I find an easy opening.

Game in a Nutshell: A tile-laying game masked in cards where players attempt to take over the others base using a small hand of cards that attack and advance in different ways.

Played as: Solo (vs. computer), 2 player (face-to-face)

Pros: Clever, simple idea. Has all the elements of a tile-laying game that I love so much in some of my most favorite games. Plays quick which leaves plenty of time for multiple plays. It's nicely priced too!

Cons: Though simple at its core, it takes some time to visually understand what's taking place on the table which so far has lead to frustration. The quickness of the game seems to possibly not allow for full mitigation of a little bad luck and things could just go sour fast seemingly out of control. Most of all, my experience so far leads me to think that going first is a considerable advantage.

Other: After a period of getting my head handed to me vs the computer implementation, I got my first chance to play face to face. It was harder then I expected to describe how attack support works (the hardest thing for me to learn too). After two fast plays the person was done probably due to frustration and the deceivingly abstract gameplay. Two others I tried it with had similar results-- frustrating learning curve and not enough reward in the end. Traded.

Best Use: A quick, compact card game with a tile-laying soul that is fast to pull out and play at home or on the road.

RATING: 3
The idea is good, play is quick, the rules are clear (despite my repeated failure to remember that you have to have supply pointing to the card you're attacking) and those are all good things. I think there are many things to admire about this very clean design.

But it's just not my thing. It's too abstract for my tastes, and it doesn't make me feel like I'm fighting a battle. You could put little symbols on the cards and play just fine and call it an abstract card placement game with a target objective, and to my mind it would lose little, because the theme is so light. If you're looking for something wargamish, this is not it. If you're looking for something quick with an effective wargamish theme, this is not it. 

I'd probably play it to kill some time standing in line or to kill a couple minutes waiting for another game to finish. But I can't imagine ever asking to play.

Grognards and ATers beware. Fans of light (and lightly themed) Euros and card games, take the plunge. The former--your head will explode. The latter--your head will be happy.

*Nov 2013* After 17 plays, I think I can say this game has legs. The only reason the game is not rated higher is due to the fact that it's all that it is. But I have yet to walk away from a session feeling I've had enough of it. While at first glance, the game looks like it may be solvable, it is absolutely not. It's fun and deep and if you can get into the zone, very replayable. Games take 10-15 minutes so multiple games in each session is a given.

There are very few card games that really capture my interest and this one is probably at the top.

A really well done game that plays fast and keeps you engaged.  The winning combos feel a little scripted but it's still excellent. Hundreds of plays on the original program, even more on the iOS version.

Over 700 plays on iOS now, I stopped logging after 300.  I'm liking the game even more.

This game takes the crown as my favorite game playable in 15 minutes or less.

Short and easy to learn, but deep, deeper than it looks. Easy to slip in a pocket and break out in an airplane or while waiting for a doctor's appointment. It may draw some looks, sure, but what they don't realize is that you're playing one of the best and simplest deconstructions of the wargame genre. It's all about supply, flanking, and effective use of support, and all it takes is a 10-page card-sized rulebook to explain it. Plus, with games averaging 10 to 20 minutes, you can play it multiple times a session easily. The strategy is very reminiscent of chess - anyone who's good at a game like that is going to rock at BfH218.

Tasty. About as complex a wargame as I am prepared to get to grips with, and best because of its subtle replayability. While successive plays won't be wildly different, there are a handful of opening games to get used to, along chess principles (if that's not too lofty a comparison). Hopefully there's room for future expansions, too.

Took me a while to get my head around the rules for supply, support and attack, but past that, this game is obviously really well thought out and play-tested, which for my money places it a notch above other war-themed card games--even though it's not a simulation. Another plus is that although much thought must go into playing the cards--which have varying abilities and strengths--kids can play it, too. Essentially an abstract game, but some thought has gone into the particular strengths and abilities of each of the unit types, plus the high quality of the cards and black-and-white war photos on the cards are bonuses.

RATING: 8
Very descent game. Plays like chess.
Short play time, less than 10 mins a game if you know what you're doing. Small and portable. Perfect game during short breaks.
Don't let the play time fool you though, the 10 mins spent would be a good tactic exercise for your brain.

NOTE:
It can be very deep and strategic, if you construct your deck first then play. (Instead of shuffle the deck.)

RATING: 7
A neat game of laying out cards to the grid in such a way that you whack more of the enemy than he gets to whack you. Cards have different powers, abstractly representing the different types of forces in an army. Some will auto-kill an enemy card it's played orthoganally next to, some diagonal. Some must be played orthoganally next to your own cards, some diagonally. Some will kill an enemy only if you have another card next to the enemy already. Which makes for lots of ways for the game to evolve, almost Hive like. You get to play two cards a turn so you get to play combinations. Apart from the overall whack-win, you also win if you occupy the opponent's start space, so creating pressure on that space can be nicely distracting. It's probably an idea to count down your opponent's best cards so you know when their options may be more limited. For a simple card-based game, there's interesting decisions to make each turn and I feel like it'll be a while until I get to grips with how best to play - always a good thing.

Genius. Quick, unique, and tactical back-and-forth 2-player portable card game. The theme of the units fits the gameplay well.

You don't have to like war games to like this. You don't have to like abstract games to like this.

Rulebook could make clearer the connection between supply and deployment, the possibility of tied wins, what happens to destroyed units, and what capture means.

There are always interesting decisions to make, and those decisions become more stressful as the stakes get higher. The lead can quickly swing from one player to the other, as the leader can find himself suddenly backed into a corner if his opponent plays a couple cards right. It's very tactical, however, (instead of strategic) so AP is not a big problem. It plays quick, even with a thinker across the table.

I initially avoided this game for months because the rules didn't make sense when I first read them, but now that I've sat down and played the game, I love it.

Nice little tactical game of card placement. After several plays with the kids, it's clear that there are some uncharted depths to the game as far as hand management goes. That's impressive considering the size, price and apparent simplicity. The rulebook could have been better produced.

I just love small-box card games and this one is really neat. Essentially it's a 2-player abstract but the supply and attack rules for the different units make it feel surprisingly thematic, much more so than the insect movement rules in Hive, for example.

Good two player game where you are trying to to deploy forces attempting to take their opponents base. A simple draw and place game. I like how the "map" is the grid of cards that expands as the game develops. 
The cards/units have limits as to where they can deploy (supply) and the opponents card they can attack or help attack (support). 

Fairly simple but a nice filler

Enjoyable short game - reminds me somehow of Neuroshima Hex (random draw, then placement with deterministic combat), but much simpler rules.

It definitely has good replay value. Lots of good interesting gameplay in a small package and simple elegant rules!

Meh. Games are too short, and the winning play is always obvious. If you are able to establish solid ground and your opponent doesn't have cards to take you out, you can get the win easily. Just never clicked with me. Not a bad filler game when two players are waiting for the rest of the group, though.

Very quick, light and fluffy. The mechanics are a dry abstract game played on a grid. Kinda fun though because it doesn't drag out. Not up to the depth and variation of play you get from Hera and Zeus though, but much simplier.

RATING: 8
Heavy on strategy, light on luck, with a theme that fits its mechanics like a glove - a truly wonderful and pleasurable gaming experience that may not be as expansive, involving, and intricately layered as other war games - like TWILIGHT STRUGGLE - but neither is it as prolonged, demanding, and dependent on secondary conditions (space availability, time allotment, and other players' interest). 

Accessible, portable, and fun - one of the best 2-player fillers out there!

 Good game, the theme is pasted on and the title could more accurately be "battle AROUND hill 218". There's a bit of a weird feeling that I have when I deploy my troops and then I cannot maneuver them but once I remember it's an abstract game, OK. I don't want to sound mean, it's a good game once one gets used to its special rhythm and tactics and I feel I will be able to speak better once I get more familiar with them.

Card. Nice little wargamerish filler. The rules are pretty simple, but it's all about jockeying for position with your cards as you try to occupy the enemy's HQ spot on the table. Played twice, around 10 minutes the first game and 20 the second. Great value and portability.

[i]Good Abstract Game that Isn't Deep Enough...! There is a Very Realistic Dead-End Here[/i]

Thought this would be a great quick game with some legs... but after practicing against computerized AI I'm pretty sure this game is solvable after a number of plays. Not solvable as in you'll always win (there is randomness), but solvable as in there are only a few paths to victory and once you know them how to play your hand becomes kinda obvious... and then the game is decided by randomness.

Great snack, for a while. it's so easy to play this many times in a row. But I need to find some better/willing opponents to show me some light before it's really super satisfying agai -- because for perhaps the first time ever since Tic-Tac-Toe, I actually feel like I've mastered this game to the point where I can't play any better.

I really enjoy simple mano y mano strategy games and this is no exception.  The players are trying to capture each others base by battling around the fabled Hill 218.  The players alternate playing two cards each round onto the table.  The cards are played into a space that is an imaginary grid on the table.  Each card has three attributes, where it attacks (and if it needs support), where it gets supplied from, and what squares it supports.  Each card gets played and needs to be in supply (except for paratroopers), and then may attack any enemy card if there is an enemy card in an area you can attack, the attack is resolved by the enemy player removes the attacked card.  So players jockey for position and try to establish a defense while trying to push the opponent out of their base.  Fun little game; but I think may not have huge replayability since consecutive plays may stagnate into an optimal strategy that may not have to be altered greatly in order to achieve victory.

RATING: 6.5
[Your Move Games 07 edition] {WWII, filler; player-elimination}  It would be a pity if this game is OOP.

Although this is a card game, it actually is an abstract game.  Players lay cards on the table with supply restrict to form battle line to destroy opponent's units or occupy his/her base.

It is a nice game. It is easy to teach and understand the rules.  Nice interaction and balance.  A very good choice as a 2p filler.

The components are good.  The cardstock is thick. I wish the cards were linen-finished. The illustration is pedestrian, yet effective enough.

RATING: 7
Combat themed card game. Both players have matching decks depicting different types of troops and equipment and must place them in an attempt to capture their opponents 'base'. Each card is different in the way it is used as they vary in their supply, attack and support and attention has to be paid in how to use each one most effectively, especially as you have to maintain supply lines. This is a surprisingly strategic game considering it plays so quickly and the basic principle of placing cards next to one another is so simple.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very interesting concept, and I always like these quick two player affairs. I can't help feeling like there would be a lot of stalemates though (that was my experience), and how on earth is the first player supposed to win when they only get to place one card on the last turn? I suppose you just have to hope to do it before the deck is exhausted.

I've played this a few times at various intervals in real life now.  I like this game. 

The computer AI is scary good.  But I've gotten to the point I can fairly regularly beat it.  Unfortunately, all that play has made it nearly impossible for anyone I play with in Real life to actually beat me now.  And they probably won't commit the time or energy into enough plays to make this interesting.

I think it would be fun to play this in real life with someone very good at it.

RATING: N/A
Not a bad little quickie game.  It will take a couple of plays through to get the feel for it.  Essentially you try to take the opponents base by playing cards on the table.  The only way you can take out his cards is to play a combat card that is supported by another one of your cards.  You play two cards on your turn and trade back and forth till one of you is able to place a card on the opposite side of the starting card (the hill)

I like the fact that the mechanics are very tied into the theme of the game. This scratches the same itch from the Hive bite, yet in a totally different way.

Once you reach the top of the learning curve, the decisions narrow. Hidden hands still keep the game from drowning though as you can risk attacks. Need an opponent of equal skill to keep the game re-playable.

I bought this as a cheap, fast filler game that would appeal to my wargaming nature. But this is a much, much deeper game than its playing time would seem to imply. This is a genuinely excellent strategy game that just happens to have a short playing time and enough thematic elements to keep from being too dry. And, unlike many card games, luck plays only a minor role, as any new player will soon discover by playing against the online AI.

I love small games that pack in a good amount of strategic and tactical choices. This is one such game. There are only half a dozen types of cards and a grid that usually doesn't exceed 5x5, but it can present some agonizingly difficult choices that may determine the ultimate victory. It's great!

I like the theme, and I like the extremely short playtime.  Not so hot on the fairly abstract nature of it, although such abstractions are forgivable in the context of playtime.  Reminds me a lot of [gameid=17396].  Design is done quite well, and this could be easy filler for a couple of wargamers getting together.  It took me forever to learn to beat the AI that's out there on the web, but now that I can win about 50% of the time, it seems to mostly come down to the cards that we pull.  My hope is that this is either because there's more to the game than I have found, or that it's a result of the rush strategy that the AI uses.

This game is a bit more Chess-like than I was expecting, but it has a nice ebb and flow, partly because of that similarity.  It's a little trickier than I expected to get the basics down, since supply, attack, and support all work a little bit differently based on the card icons, but once you have it down, it will all make sense, both thematically and in regards to the rules.  The game is all about building up a defensive army to allow you to keep your opponent "in check" so you can make one good offensive move, and it works remarkably well.  The rule book could use some clarifications (or at least some better organization), but overall it's a satisfying tactical game that doesn't take that long to play.  Note that people who are spatially challenged might find difficulty playing the game, since being able to see future moves and how they will affect the game is critical.

This game is waaaaaay deeper than it has any right to be, given its simplicity. I've gone through several revolutions of thought over the course of my play, and there's no guarantee I am playing close to optimally *even now,* after hundreds of plays.

One thing I will say is that I strongly disagree with the decision to use old WW2 photos as the art. It makes the game feel stuffy and boring, and it's hard to convince anyone to actually play the damn thing. That said, *if* you can get into it, it's a very strong game that is well worth your time.

A tiny and abstract wargame played out with a small deck of cards. It's surprisingly deep considering how simple it is and how quickly it plays. In many ways it reminds me of Hive, a game that I consider one of the best abstracts of all time. For less than ten bucks, this game is a steal.

This is a game of small advantages. It looks like it'd be a grand strategic game, almost abstract-like, where you plan out moves many turns in advance, but I don't think there's a lot of that here. It doesn't make it a bad game, but it does make it not what I wanted it to be. Those of you who like your games tactical should adore this, as it is one of the best tactical games I've played.

Played against the AI - feels like a nice quick 2 player abstract with an excellent WWII theme. All the unit abilities feel appropriate.  Will need to play with the discards sorted against card-counters though (and it helps to know what you've got coming) - but a big point in its favour:  the AI does not use card counting (and it's generally regarded as very good).  

Rulebook is one of the card-sized minibooklets.  Nice big type - easy to read - but you do find yourself flipping the pages a lot.   Not sure if it was better than the fold-out sheets - all the rules would easily fit on a single page.  I have trouble remembering exactly how the turns go, and unfortunately that's in the middle of the book :P

Card quality is excellent.  It might have been nice to have slightly different pictures on all the cards.  Pictures are good (except for the hill).

Great little warm-up game. Nice, sturdy cards with historic graphics. Simple with just enough complexity to satisfy both wargamers and non-wargamers. Everyone who's played this with me always comes back for more, or goes out and buys it.

Initial Impressions: What a fun, simple, game!  There are lot of tactical decisions to be made that make this seemingly simple card game nice and tactical.  The game box quotes 20-30 minutes for play time, but I think our first game only lasted about 15 minutes with rule instruction.  Really enjoyable, and portable to boot!

I didn't find it that good. There are only a few ways to play the cards intelligently and there were not enough options for me.

For such a short game, this is very engaging.  It is very interesting to manage the supply, attack and support elements of each card simultaneously.

Deep little card game. Brutal AI on computer version. I like it - but doubt it will get played much with other card games suggested first. But a solid design - a good game for lunch breaks... travel... quickies.

In my opinion the game is always played in the same way. Not very enjoyable and I don't have the feeling of a wargame.

En mi opinión se juega simpre de la misma forma. No es muy divertido y no tengo la sensación de juego de guerra.

Bookshelf Games vidcast made me aware of this game, and the Java version completely sold me on it. I just bought my own copy for face-to-face gaming. It took me a good read of the rules before I could beat the AI, but now I easily handle the Easy AI, and have to suffer losses to the Expert one instead.  :D

[b]GOOD. IF A LITTLE TRICKY TO TEACH SOME FOLKS...[/b]

Excellent symmetrical logic/strategy card game. Addictive.

For cost reasons, probably, they didn't put Panzers and Nazi stormtroopers on the German deck cards. That's a pity, as it would increase my enjoyment of the game, rather than having two flavours of the same pictures.

A couple of gamers that I've attempted to introduce to the game, just couldn't get their heads around the support rules, forcing me to abandon the game. That said, my Dad picked it up fast and we had some great games in a hospital waiting room over a couple of hours one time - and he's close to retirement.

This is a really neat two player military strategy game using cards.  It could probably just as easily be an abstract, but the WW2 units help you remember the uses of the various cards.  I played the online java version several times and enjoyed it very much. It did seem to get fairly repetitive with reepeated plays, but it was still tense and fun regardless.

It's light, fun, easy to teach and only lasts a few minutes.  There isn't a whole lot to this game, but its so short that there doesn't need to be.  It is one of the best card fillers out there and with such a low price its a safe game to invest in.

I really like this game, but the wife doesn't want to play it often. It's a great war game in a little box with lots of strategy.

Neat little game of tactics, and if you want to be a little bit more competitive, will involves a little card counting. This game has a lot of depth to explore, in terms of optimal plays/card synergies, and will easily provide you many, many hours of enjoyment if you like more abstract two-player games.

It goes up to 8.5 against a certain opponent :)

Nice fast and tactical game. It has some kind of pattern recognition in it, so go players will maybe like it. If you keep losing to the same opponent, try to improve your game, don't whine about luck of the draw.

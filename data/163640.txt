This is really far and above one of the best mini-games. There are really good choices to make, strategy, thought, and interest. 

On the negative side, the rules are not even close to being thorough enough. They leave out SO much. I have played, read all the rules threads and still have questions. I hope I am playing it right.

For the price, this is a great buy. I still prefer Race to it for my space game of choice for 2 players, but this is still a very interesting game with a lot of depth for its length and price. 

I would say this is a very excellent buy at the price.

RATING: 7
Nice little game, but the rulebook is horribly bad. Yes, there are revised and improved rulebooks online as well, but we still had to consult the forums to get through the first game. Lots of things seem to be taken for granted rather than clearly expressed.

Apart from that, I really like this game. It's pretty amazing that you can have this much fun with 34 cards. The illustrations are not bad either, and something that really impresses me is that you can sleve the cards and they'll still fit in the tiny box!

As far as "free" promos go, well, I'm sure pinting them wasn't free and I really find it rather wasteful to include so many of them in such small a game (about a quarter of the cards in the box were promos).

The small size, affordability, good box and good game (once you get through the rules) make up for the few cons.

2 plays / 2 players

LIKE: Quick, multi-use cards. Very small footprint.
DISLIKE: The difference between spoils and colonies can sometimes confuse players.
OVERALL: One quick play reveals that this micro game has a bit of depth. When do you grab cards for scoring and actions, when do grab cards to block? Interesting, eager to play it more.

I gave a good review of this game IN SPITE of its horrible rulebook (because hey, it's a Tasty Minstrel game, and that publisher has a talent for bad rulebooks). Microcosm is a very good, deep and intricate little game, with lots of agonizing decisions and not too much secret information. Sleek, smart and (somewhat) fast to play. Highly recommended, once you know how to play it, of course :-)

This is my new benchmark for complexity in micro games.

Rules that can be explained in a minute, but then you're staring at the 3 available cards and can't imagine how much you have to take into account: The card color, icon, effect, scoring condition, when is the right time to forfeit a "real" action to pick up cards from the discard pile, ...

And everything seems so perfectly balanced.

Great game.

RATING: 6.25
Traded. I really liked how such a small combination of cards can provide a meaty game in a short amount of time. But it didn't hit the table too often. After further plays, it started to feel a bit like a point salad. Both players are ensured to have 9 domain cards by the end of the game, even without making any substantial decision making yet those domain cards usually give you a combo, thus VP, if not more.

This was very 'meh' for us. We picked it up at Half Price Books for 5 bucks. It's a very, very tight game- it doesn't last long and you're moves are quite limited. Would be easy for a better player to min/max and obliterate another if they knew the cards well. Easy to block others, difficult to get what you need. Not sure if will play again- too confrontational and frustrating for my tastes.

A micro-deck(hand)builder that can be played in 15 minutes. It's fun, quick, easy and 2 sets can be combined for 3-4 player games (tried it and works pretty well). The only problem is the rulebook: is the worst I've ever seen.

Eminent Domain: Microcosm is a kickstarter game and it shows... The rulebook is crap. The game itself is a microgame take on deckbuilding. While the game does have some interesting mechanics there just isn't enough to make it something I'd want to play.

RATING: 8
There should be a warning label on this game, the rules contained herein are insufficient. You will need to search online to figure out the missing rules.

However, the play itself is an interesting distillation of the hand building mechanism from Concordia. Possibly too distilled. It's not that I want it to be more complex, but I would perhaps like it to be more involved. However, every one of the nine turns you take in this game will have repercussions as all of your actions will have impacts on your other actions as cards fulfil multiple functions (as actions, points, and boosts).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's very quick... too quick.  You really have to quickly adjust to what options are available.  When to pick up cards from the discard pile seems to be a hugely important decision - it interrupts your ability to act, and you only get a few actions per game.

Microcosm does micro well and with a lot more strategy than most micro-games.  Once you figure the rules out and get a few games played, it can be very fast and very competitive.

There are two issues I have with Microcosm.  First, the rule sheet is atrocious; it's best to watch some videos and find the detailed rules online.  Secondly, some cards require you to reveal you have an amount of a certain resource before you can perform the action; while your discards aren't counted the cards you reveal aren't required to be discarded, this allows players to hammer certain actions, i.e. warfare in a way the opponent cannot really counteract.

While Microcosm isn't a perfect game, it's still a good game and a prime example that just because a game is small and of few components, that doesn't mean it can't have a solid level of strategy and depth to its gameplay.

One of the worst rulebooks I've seen in a while... most terms and locations are not defined, and you just need to try to "guess" the rules by reading the cards and figure out what makes sense and doesn't.

Its on the plus side of two player games because it makes you think. However, its kind of tedious. Its more of a numbers crunching game. The rules are butt-horrible.

What a fantastic game - one of the only microgames I've played that in no way feels reduced or incomplete. The decisions are interesting, there's tension, and if anything, it feels harder and more clever than the original Eminent Domain. A must buy for anybody who wants a deep two-player game that you can carry in your backpack. 

This is one of the best games in the TMG line.

A light and simple game, yet retains enough strategic choices to where you need to pay attention and can't just brain-dead waltz your way through it.

The art gets repetitive though (really? the exact same picture for every single science research card? bleh.) and the rules are overly streamlined, to the point that several important points seem left out or left very vague. Had to contact the designer twice for rules clarifications. :(

Still, a satisfying "big game in a little box". But I can't help but feel this game wasn't given the due attention from the publisher. It was probably intended to be a hook to get people interested in the full Eminent Domain game. Which is a shame, because this little gem deserves more unique attention all its own.

I like how quickly and easily this plays. It's simple to teach and has just enough strategy to keep things interesting, yet ends after 5-10 minutes.

The art is pulled straight from the original Eminent Domain, but the gameplay is new. It's small, sells for $7 new, and easy to recommend for a quick 2-player game.

RATING: 6
This game is a gold min for other game designer. I like the idea of having games with really few cards, but most of those games like for example "Love Letter" is way too much simplistic.

This game is much more complex and has much more depth. It take the core rules of the original game and shrink it into a 30 card games. There are very interesting mechanics in there, and it gave me some ideas for games of mine.

The technological advantage is awesome, you have the advantage, or you don't. What makes this possible is being a 2 player game. So no need for tech trees.

My complaints about this game are as follow:

There is a lot of information, sometimes too much, which makes it very hard to analyze and find the best action to make.

For example, each card has a scoring mechanism rule, it's hard to actually consider this in your strategy, but if don't consider it, it's not so bad. I Imagine it's something for experienced players.

But it get worst when all cards have a bonus icon and a color which creates 2 layers of information. Bonus icons, fine, they work well. Planet colors on planets, fine that also works, but also adding planet colors on regular cards, that is too much.

I would have loved more standardization in the cards abilities. For example, having 5 type of basic action only. Here you have the basic action, but also unique action which force you to read the cards all the time. Some of them event have permanent powers when in a specific zone of play making it hard to remember those abilities. More standardization would have helped players memorize those abilities and prevent having to read all the time. Still, I imagine experienced players does not need to read much.

In general, I am impressed, I hope more games like that get released since it's small, cheap while having a good level of depth.

Originally I backed this KS but then un-backed it because one, I'm not a fan of Eminent Domain and two, I haven't played too many of the other "microgames" I bought. (Like most people, I backed Coin Age. And, like most people, I haven't really played it.) In one sense, this game is a little more interesting than actual Eminent Domain because it plays much faster and a little more interestingly. In another sense, I went with an all-out military strategy and steamrolled my opponent. The microcosmic apple has not fallen far from the Eminent Domain tree. It's worth pointing out that this game doesn't even pretend that trading is worth doing.

(Edit: played again and won with a tech strategy)

Simple two player game that plays a lot like Eminent Domain.  You draft a card and can play a card from your hand or take any number of cards from your discard into your hand.  Each player continues to draft cards until each has nine.  Some cards colonize planets, attack planets or give a tech.  All have special scoring.  At the end of the game everyone performs the scoring and highest score wins.

Surprisingly good two player game. The rules are awful.  The only way to learn the game is online

Interesting two player microgame. I need to play some more of it to give it a rating.

EDIT 29.05.2016: still hard for me to rate properly, but I'll give it a six for now. I've got better two-player games, this one feels like it's a bit too cut-down, to the point that it feels like it's lacking a proper mechanic. I doubt I'll be playing it often, but it's good to have as a pocket game.

Quite a bit going on with this little 2p game. On the surface it looks like there are plenty of strategies to explore. Played twice now and looking forward to multiple plays in the near future.

My one big criticism off the bat is the rules insert is only semi-useful. We had to go to Seth's play through video on the kickstarter page because by themselves the rules didn't fully explain how the game works. What's the difference between a colony and a planet, for example?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Not bad for a small pack of cards.  The scoring system has many paths for winning, which gives this game replay value.  It's quick, easy to set up and (despite the paucity of rules) relatively easy to pick up. My only real gripe is that sometimes it ends too quickly, but I can't gripe because I like quick but relatively deep games which are easy to set up :-)

I feel like a terrible rulebook makes this game have a lower rating than it would have had otherwise.  Revised rulebook is much better.    

This is definitely a micro game - 18 cards and takes 10 minutes to play.  Due to this, don't expect a very deep game.  Definitely some strategy to the game since it has end game scoring like Concordia - the cards in your deck are multipliers for all of the cards in your tableau.

It's an interesting little card game. Some issues with this one though:
- Colonizing seems way more efficient than combat
- You aren't likely to be able to attack a players colonized planet
- Surveying seems largely a waste of time

RATING: 8
Very quick and fairly light.  The random nature of the small decks/stacks can make focusing on a strategy a little difficult.  But that only makes for some take-that type moments, and the game is over fast enough that getting trounced because of an unfavorable shuffle just makes me want to jump in for a rematch.

Bravo! THIS is the 2 player micro-game I've been looking for. A fast, fun, meaty, and juicy deck-building game with a nice mix of strategy and tactics by Seth Jaffee. The rules are simple: take a card, play a card. Okay, there's a little more than that, but most turns will be just that. A little learning curve since the rules are mostly on the rulesheet, while the rest of the rules are on the cards. Also, there will be slight AP to figure out the various strategies.

There is the possibility that players familiar to Eminent Domain will grasp concepts quicker than those not, but I do not know for sure, yet.

I love the "grandfather" game Eminent Domain, so I had hopes for this game, but it was quit poor. Gameplay was so so, not really worth the time, even though it only took 15 minutes.

Now this is a micro game with some strategy. Given that at about 10-15 minutes there can only be so much strategy but still it works well. You collect and play cards, but the actions on the cards are just the start since each card gives points at the end of the game. So you need to specialize and get large multipliers and cards with the same objective. But your opponent is also trying to dot he same. You get 9 turns and then count points. Quite fun, a nice change to most of the micro games coming out that seem pointless.

(5+ plays)  Pick a suit (or two) and stick with it.  Sounds a lot like an old Hoyle card game.  In some ways, it is.  I really like that you can play a basic game of "suits" and at the same time, feel like you are conquering planets and flying space ships.  A quick enough 2 player game to keep my attention, but simple enough to get a few more people to play than I normally am able.

Baby EmDo. I have only played 1 game so far. It was pretty quick. Faster than, say, Star Realms. However, I would rather play Star Realms. Different games but falls into the same category, I feel. A simple card game (once you find good rules) with the same art as EmDo. Not too shabby. I look forward to playing again. Not sure how much replay value there is. It was like $6 so I had to at least give it a shot.

This is a short 2 player card game that uses the theme from Eminent Domain. We sort of muddled our way through it, but the game didn't come with a proper rulebook, so we had a lot of rules questions and confusion through the entire game. There might be a good game here, for awhile I was too frustrated with it to give it another fair try. I revisited it after some time, and found it to be pretty unremarkable.

For a seven minute game, this game is a decent one with a little bit of theme and decision making. You really can get into the theme a bit and there is some real strategy. I'm not saying that there is that much of either theme or strategy in comparison to a longer game, but what I am saying is, in the realm of fillers that take under 10 minutes this game has a little more than most. The only problem is, once you are done with the game, you always want more. You finish the game and say, "what, we just got started". But if you just have thirty minutes to game one night and you whip out Star Realms for your first game and then play Eminent Domain Microcosm for your second. You can get a couple of good games in, in thirty minutes. The concept of this game is hard to grasp at first, but once you get it, you will think it is super easy. Bottom line, a decent filler to fill a 10 minute slot.***Wife:7.5

#1 Issue: CANNOT play the game with the rules that come in the box!

It assumes knowledge of Eminent Domain and leaves out critical information on how a turn works, what cards do what, what everything on a card means, has no/minimal images to help, etc.

Additionally, extra cards come as promos without any mention of what they are for, including Eminent Domain (board game) which confuses the issue with the above mentioned issues. In other words some cards in the Eminent Domain: Microcosm game say Eminent Domain on them, but are not used in the game, without ever knowing that they should be removed.

While I would not normally rate a game at a 1, unfortunately literally "Unplayable" warrants it in this case.

A forgetable card game about multiple simultaneous tug-of-wars.  It's too easy for a player to pull ahead and stay ahead, and not much fun to be the player who is struggling to get a foothold against the opponent.  There are things to do, but the draft board limits your options a lot, the discard pickup slows the tempo of losers more than winners, and much of the game is counting lots of icons to figure out the obvious best play.

 I can not really articulate the reason very well, but I did not really like this game. Everything worked well mechanically, but that was about it. It worked, but it was not fun. It was not exciting. The game is short, but unlike most quick playing games it was completely devoid of the let's play again feeling. It feels like they tried to make a souless euro as a micro game. The problem is those kind of themeless and dry euro games can get by just on the strength and depth of their mechanics. With just 10 minutes and a few cards, there is enough time or space to capture that depth.

Belles cartes, jeu rapide, ne réinvente rien mais ok en 10 minutes. J'ai l'impression qu'on va rapidement se lasser.

RATING: 6
A solid micro-game that may reveal a few hidden tricks as I play more. For now, I view the game as a solid 10-15 minute filler with room for at least a handful of different strategies. The rulebook is atrocious (download a better fan-made one from the Files section here on BGG), and I get the feeling that this is at least in part an advertisement for the full-blown Eminent Domain. Yet I can't help feeling that it might just stand solidly on it's own. I hope those suspicious are confirmed, but only additional plays will tell. Finally, the scoring is a bit of a pain until you figure out a system. I recommend dividing the cards up by scoring type first.

Very good distillation of the original Eminent Domain into a microgame. Right now the deepest < 10 min game I own.

Worst rule book I've ever read (it's actually a 1 page sheet).  So many things missing or not explained and that is even going over all the cards' text first.  We managed to get through most of it, and it seemed like it might be an OK game w/ some fleshed out rules.

Truly good microgame, one of the best I've played, and that's in spite of the terrible rules sheet.

Fantastic two player hand management game. Every time I play it I'm reminded of just how much I enjoy the hand management mechanic. I actually enjoy it slightly more than deckbuilding because the timing is more uncertain. Definitely a keeper.

Very small and fast micro game in space. A bit quirky to learn, because the rules don't tell you that much, but interesting mechanisms. Sadly only two players, unless you use two packs and don't mind half official variants. A bit hard to teach maybe, because despite the smallness there is a lot going on.

Culled - First wave; Gifted to Macinda

Why we culled it: ED:M is a cool little game that really does its best to capture the flavor of EmDo. The artwork and iconography all sync up well, but we found that all it really did was make us long for the real deal. The rule sheet for ED:M is terrible and full of a lot of vague nonsense and assumptive pictographics, so to actually learn the game you need to spend some time on the BGG forums. Once over this hurdle, it plays well enough and is a proper contender in the halls of "express" microgames. It turns out that I'm not much of a fan of express microgames, though. On to a better home.

About [thing=163640][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=163640][/thing] is a microgame, composed of 34 cards, and it tries to capture de same feeling as that present in [thing=68425][/thing], with less rules, cards and in a fraction of time, being also a 2 players only game.

The game lasts for around 18 quick rounds, in which players can colonize or capture planets, develop technologies and use politics to have some boosts during the play, in order to create your galatic empire.

The short rules have several gaps, allowing for several doubts while playing for the first times, but once the flow is going, the pace is good enough.

While is has interaction between players, it isn't a full on attack mode like that in [thing=147020][/thing]. The goal is to have more points at the end of the game, considering that all cards allow to score something players can acquire during play.

In the end [thing=163640][/thing] is efficient in creating, in a short frame, a nice game with several options, even if for a couple of plays some quirkiness will arise.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
In her turn a player takes a card from one of the three exposed or one blind from the draw deck, then she does one action - the card used to trigger the action goes to the discard pile; or she can take all the cards in the discard pile back into her hands.

The actions are of three types:
- Colonize: allow to take a planet and keep in front of you, as you can, later, use it for the benefit each has;
- Capture: take over a planet - it goes to the spoils pile;
- Research: develop a tech that can help during the play or in the final score;
- Political: usually actions that allow to mess with the other player or obtain informations/advantages during play.

Some actions, to have full effect, require cards from the player's hand to be revealed - these don't go to the discard pile.

The game ends once all the cards in the draw deck are taken. The player that took the final cards plays her turn and the game ends. All cards score something - like 1 point for each colony - and the players tally the points. The winner will be the person with the most points.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
Which card to take, considering four things:
a) The action it allows to trigger;
b) What it will score in the end of the game;
c) The symbol it has (useful to make some actions better and/or are used to score);
d) The planet it has - used for scoring.

Then which action to trigger - these will be easier, as most of them will be driven by the cards you will have in hand (for instance, with several symbols for colonize, you will likely colonize). And when to take your discard back into your hands - this is important on itself, as it will allow for better actions and it has a nice timming in it, as it is likely that you will be doing this only once during the play.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Fast playing time (10 to 15 minutes);
- Good set of decisions and possibilities considering the small amount of time it takes and the short supply of cards the game comes with;
- A not too agressive head to head game, but with some interesting interactions;
- The box fits the cards with sleeves.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- The rules leave a lot of room for doubts, being sorely incomplete in some aspects. Maybe of the worst rulebooks I have seen in quite a while;
- Scoring isn't fun or easy, and can lead to mistakes.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Probably surprise at first: as you simply won't really understand what you are suppose to do. Then you will do - for some of it. You will think that should be enough to get the game going, as it is so small that it shouldn't need much more. But it does. You are confused about revealing planets, attacking planets or colonizing the planets of the other player - can you do it? No? Yes. Can the other player defend against this? Well... Better just do a Research or conquer a planet of the middle of the table.

Anyway, once the hurdle of learning the game and a little hurt for being betrayed by the rulebook, you became surprised that [thing=163640][/thing] has many more possibilities and room for tatics - even some light strategy - built in a clever way. Every choice has importance and weight, be for the moment and/or for the end game scoring. The play is always pushing towards the finish - every turn at least one card will be taken, and the game is one step to end. There is no way to stop the it - it is eminent, after all.

Therefore, in spite of the rules trying to murder the game on sight, [thing=163640][/thing] can survive with some effort by the players, and it surely delivers a good, smart and surprisingly rich game for those that resist against that tragedy in form of rules. Recommended.

Micro game that packs a ton of conflict and tension in under 15 minutes.  Taking the best card or making the power play in the moment may not lead you to victory.  The game seems far more expansive than it's size would indicate without being overly complicated.  

Perhaps a design flaw is that war seems generally the weaker path when acquiring planets than to colonize.  More plays may prove this notion false but no experience to indicate anything to the contrary so far.

It is surprising how the bad the rules sheet is considering the amount of materials they need to cover.

Overall this is a great little game that will have a long future in my travel collection.

After one game, not sure how I feel about the game yet. It plays fast and offers some decent decisions, but the artwork is mediocre at best and the rulebook is too concise (omits some important rules). Still, curious how my next game will go.

Fell flat on my first play, but the depth is coming out with repeat plays. Quite a bit more variety and decisions than other microgames. Really needs to be played a few times in a row to pick up on the strategies for scoring.

A great microgame that really packs a punch. The unique multi-functional cards gives you a lot of options and demand a deep thinking and decisions. Though it  still plays 10-15 minutes. Definitely one of the best for me!

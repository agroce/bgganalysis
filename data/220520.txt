This one needs more plays to determine where it will ultimately settle out against it's brother, [i]Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small[/i].  This one seems as though it could definitely use an expansion to introduce some more variety in the buildings (or room furnishings), though I do like the mechanic that varies how and when the various buildings (room furnishings) enter the game.

RATING: 6
Quite a tightly designed little 2-player worker placement game and plays super quick. However, it's essentially the least compelling part of Caverna for me (filling caves with text box rooms).

Would prefer to play a longer Rosenberg game or possibly pick up the 2p version of Agricola. Removed from collection.

Caverna: Cave vs Cave is a two player / express version of the original game.  Players alternate taking actions to excavate their cave, furnish rooms, and collect resources.  As each cave is built out, each new room provides additional benefits and actions as well as victory points. This is a Quicker and much lighter than the original game...easy to play and lots of fun.

Provisional 7. As much as I think 2P Caverna is not quite right, I'm not totally sold on what I think of this one either. I fundamentally prefer straight Caverna's actions and mechanisms, but this is tighter as a solo/duo design. Will be exploring more.

RATING: 8
Very tight action selection. I'll be interested to see how this holds up over time. Although there will always be some variation in the order that action and room tiles become available, I assume that at some point this will feel very samey. 

Not an issue yet. Having a lot of fun playing this one with the Mrs.

Good, quick, light game for 1 or 2. The solo game feels a bit more strategic than the 2 player game, and is largely driven by the room tiles and the initial 4-6 that are uncovered due to excavation. The 2 player game is much more tactical as you attempt to progress around the other's players action selections.

After my first few plays, I felt the room tiles provided a bunch of variability between plays. However, as you get more used to the game, you start focusing in on particular tile synergies and the room tile variability has less impact. Good game, but not spectacular.

Score after one play: 7. I expect rating to rise. Quite a different feel versus Agricola: All Creatures. Pretty easy and intuitive to learn, yet quite deep for a small quick game. Quite a nice production, my only crit there is that it would have been more thematic to have pictures of the rooms/furnishings, but to be fair the tiles are small and it is a small format game and the cost and benefits on the tiles are nice and clear. Oh, and the cardboard food token would have been nicer as a wooden piece like most of the others.

Clever handling of the worker placement mechanism where you don't have any meeples. Neat how you scale up in workers and some costs in a very clean way. It feels to me like a deeper worker placement than All Creatures, more of a feel of a bigger worker placement in small format. Might take 5 to 10 mins longer than All Creatures.

In some ways arguably better than All Creatures. Time will tell but just one play in my preference is All Creatures. The animeeples add a lot of fun and it just feels like a clean classic to me. Still, this feels very good, not quite like anything else I have, it is very portable. I am very happy with it.

Looks like it will solo well. I imagine expansions are planned, it's ripe for more rooms and actions, for variety. Some more tiles in the base would have been nice. Still, decent legs on it anyway.

I've not played Caverna, but I did enjoy Cave vs Cave. While I'm not typically a big fan of Uwe's games, I do like a few of his smaller games. Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is another good example. I think he is a great designer whose big games don't fit with my preferences... in smaller doses, I like it.

Solid for sure, but probably not earth shattering or game changing.  All the tiles are in every game, but due to where they end up when excavating, every game will feel different enough.  One of the better 2p "school night" games out there for sure.  Wish their was more tiles (both action, and building), but maybe like the 2p Agricola, they will add some later?

Very cool small game by Uwe. After few turns You can easily feel Caverna the Cave Farmers :) game can be played in 40min - small amounts of resources force player to think about every single decision. Love it! If you like Caverna you should have it too. It is great as an appetizer or if You are not in mood to play bigger euro game. Box is tiny so it can be taken everywhere :) I just hope there will be expansion with more action tiles - Uwe has to work on replay ability.

After a couple plays I can already tell this game is desperate for an expansion.  Hoping it gets the A:ACBS treatment and gets several new building tiles that add variability to the game.  Nonetheless, the game has the framework to be great and I will patiently await the inevitable expansion.

Note: We played only one game of this, and it was something I had been very excited for, being a huge fan of both 2 player-only games and Uwe Rosenberg's games. The game is a perfectly fine game by a great designer. But I don't know that it does anything better or faster than his other games. It was a slow game thanks to difficult/complex choices, but it didn't seem like that would be mitigated enough by familiarity (since you can't begin choosing/planning until your opponent is done with their turn). The variety offered by the variable order of actions and the order of rooms becoming available didn't seem like it would provide enough depth of replayability.

Caverna: Cave vs Cave is the newest 2 player remake of a much larger game. Not Uwe's best work but does get better with more plays. Theme wise it feels like Caverna, but mechanic wise I wasn't really impressed. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a solid little worker placement style game that really ends up being action selection, but it's got that Caverna feel without being Caverna, much like Inland Port to Le Havre more so than ACBAS to Agricola. I feel it's a relatively weak Uwe game but I did enjoy it quite a lot.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Have not played Caverna, so I can't compare the two, but this is a very nice, quick, two-player game. The randomness of locations makes for a bit of variability, and turns are quick and interesting. It doesn't seem like there are many different paths to victory, though, so I can see my rating falling with repeated plays. Nothing groundbreaking here, but if you're looking for a short, satisfying, traditional Euro that plays in less than an hour, this is a good choice.

RATING: 6
Due to the random nature of which rooms will show up when, it is nearly impossible to build a good engine in this game. It ends up being a random slug fest in which neither my wife or I could enjoy. Too many resources (looking at you flax) creates a fiddly mess on the player board (although I do like the resource tracker, it is not wide enough). The concept and visuals are perfectly fine. 

I am typically an Uwe fan, but this one was just a bit off the mark for me and the wife.

RATING: 5
Rebecca:
Caverna: Cave vs Cave is light.  Second lightest in Uwe's 2P small box series, which I'd rank from lighest to heaviest as:
Hengist 
Caverna: Cave vs Cave
Babel
Le Havre: Insland Port
Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small
Patchwork

The goal of Caverna: Cave vs Cave is to excavate personal player board caves to later furnish with rooms.  There's an actions track that, similarly to how actions become available in Agricola, expand by one each of the eight rounds.  Some actions allow for excavating or building/furnishing rooms.  To excavate players remove cave tiles and those tiles turn over to become the rooms available to build.  Some actions allow players to use a number of built room abilities, which are often gaining or converting resources.    Depending on the phase players get 2-4 actions per phase, alternating first player.  

The turns are brisk, and a personal resource track makes conversions quick and easy.  There is some tension over actions, but there's always something else useful to do if taken, so not a lot of denial oppurtunities.  There's a race to certain buildings, but since they vary in resource costs, and have wall requirements, it's possible to predict which one you'll get.  A neat wrinkle is the building wall requirement, but it turned out to be less of a spacial/planning puzzle than I hoped for.  

The random order that the rooms come out makes furnishing caves tactical.  The rooms have some very powerful combos, but might come out too late to set up for.

For me Cave vs Cave was a dissapointment, but I could see it being good for a duo that doesn't like conflict and maybe needs randomness to handicap the better player.

Crap, does this guy have another original thought? 
This is getting worse then Ticket to Ride or Monopoly.

Caverna was more of a church activity, a chore, then a game.  I guess I was right, it wasn't a 2 player game, if it was, why this? 

Just throw 1-7 players on the box to justify $100.00 game? Then recrank out the real 2 player game? 

Well, haven't seen that from this guy before?

Much like the Agricola 2p (All Creatures), this game focuses on one single aspect of Caverna, which is the furnishing of the cave.   That may not sound too exciting, but the game is fairly short and the decisions are deep and interesting.   The way the rubble piles are excavated into a common pool of rooms to build is perhaps the most interesting thing here.   The real challenge is in figuring out which actions to take and which rooms to activate.    The competition is definitely there and that makes it fun for me.   The lack of art on the rooms makes it a bit drab, but I don't see where there would be much room for any of that.   Solid game for 2p.

RATING: 7
Cave vs. Cave is a paired down 2-player worker placement game, similar to All Creatures Big and Small. While ACBaS primarily focuses on gaining points through animals, Cave vs. Cave focuses on resource management to build rooms worth points, or generating gold which is also worth points. This feels like a crunchier, more abstract game than ACBaS. Additionally, there is greater replay value in CvC due to how the room tiles are randomly revealed as people excavate their caves throughout the course of the game. This wouldn't need an expansion nearly as quickly as ACBaS, but regardless, there is another game (or expansion?) in the line, 'Era 2,' on the way. This is inexpensive, quick, relatively easy to explain, short setup, and moderately enjoyable. While I don't consider it as good as Patchwork, it's one of Uwe's better small box 2-player games and with Era 2 on the way, this could be a fantastic game.

TRADED IT! (For Hong Kong Deception Murder)

Agricola All Creatures Big and Small is one of the best games ever made, so perhaps my hopes for this remake were too high, but I'm afraid this one didn't hit the mark. It is compact and captures some of Caverna's gameplay, but it got thin quickly as the game amounted to simply balancing the two scoring conditions (building rooms and gaining gold). The game does not allow you to simply focus on one, as you can easily max out one category, so you are forced to play all sides... This just felt very forced and lead me to trade this one away.

The way the tiles become available for purchase was the most innovating and interesting part of the game.

[b]Rating based on - 8 plays, 2 player[/b] 
Caverna: Cave v Cave is a 2 player only version of the [-]big[/-] massive box game Caverna. It posits an action selection mechanism that each player uses to develop their cave in a weird dwarf head-to-head home improvement competition. You can use actions to excavate, build walls, and furnish your cave, as well as collect resources to help you get the most gold and points by game end. I have not played Caverna (WAY too many components for only 2 players!) so I cannot compare.

In our first few plays we found it surprisingly fun and it goes by really quickly. I'd really like to see more tiles added to the game so you're not playing with the exact tiles each time, but it was OK for now while we were still newbies, plus not all tiles come out every game anyway. Very reminiscent of Le Havre: The Inland Port (aka Spreadsheet: The Board Game) where you're recording your resources by moving up and down a tracker, but I liked this one much better. I never really felt like I was [i]using[/i] those buildings, whereas here I do. 

It's a nice little game that worked just fine, but it doesn't do anything particularly interesting or special that elevates it over other 2 player only games, or games that play well as a filler for 2 players such as Queendomino. Good, but not great. I think it would be fun to play once in a while, but I don't know how often we will reach for it... Would recommend to people just building their collections, those who don't have a lot of 2 player only games, or Uwe Rosenberg fans.

Uwe 2 player goodness.  Would rate this above Le Havre: Inland Port, but below Agricola: All Creatures.  Solid worker placement game.  I definitely enjoy that in order to get building options you first have to explore and dig out your cave.  I also like that the resource management so far seems pretty tight - you can stock pile 1 or 2 items but you usually need 3 or 4 to pull off some big moves and if you are stockpiling, you aren't moving toward expanding your cave.

I feel like having played this short game, I have no reason to play the full game.

Typical Rosenberg resource conversion game, get some resources, convert to others.  What's the point of getting food if you can use 3 of the other resource types as food at any time with an immediate conversion?

Not enough buildings, sorry, furniture, to make it interesting over repeated plays.

This felt very rushed (although I like the short play time), and there was only one tile that came out to place a wall down which meant that there were only like 5 walls that could be played.  That meant that half the building tiles couldn't be used.

In addition, while I like the theme of digging in and expanding your cave, that's where my enjoyment of the theme stopped.  I'm digging in so I can add a...Shelf?  What?  How is that interesting?  Your excavating your cave so you can put in furniture?  Talk about a wasted theme.

As an entry in Rosengerg's spin off small box two player games of his big titles, Cave vs. Cave does well enough. Worker placement to gather resources to build rooms in your cave that in turn gather more resources. This is an efficiency practice with a fun little addition of planning walls for each room. Its biggest downside is that its larger counterpart plays just fine with two in just a bit longer time frame and is more rewarding. To make it a smaller game, the components are swapped with sliders that represent resources. This is fine, but the piles of wooden bits are part of the appeal of Rosenberg's sandbox games.

Really fun simplified version of Caverna. It is such an interesting way to bring out new rooms. They are not available until excavating caverns. It definitely changes each game on what strategy you will use to get those VP's.

Sep17:

Only a couple plays in, but I'm quite impressed.  Has some solid spatial reasoning, and a solid injection of random tile availability that will drive different strategies between games.

It has (virtual) worker placement, but there is usually another (less efficient) way to do what you want.

Plays quick enough with many interesting decisions.

Makes me want to get the 2-player agricola (with the expansions so they can provide between-game variability).

Brilliant two player game. It has same Uwe's game feeling. Simple start, easy to play, but after few rounds it became challenging with high tense. I recommend for who loves Uwe's classics, must have that.

Quite different in feel to its big brother. Although the theme and core mechanic (worker placement, albeit without using worker pieces) are very similar to Caverna, the placement of rooms has another dimension and room activation is also something new.   I think for two players this might even be a superior game to Caverna.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (January 2018)

Uwe Rosenberg is one of my, all time, favorite game designers. I always buy his stuff as soon as it becomes available. I really prefer his heavy games but I always try them all. Caverna: Cave vs Cave is a light-medium game and I liked it. I´m still undecided if I should keep it but my SO also liked it so we are giving it at least another play before deciding.

Caverna: Cave vs Cave´s rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 6 minutes. Playtime is around 30 minutes which is perfect for the weight of the game.

The game´s components are good and the art is very good and very reminiscent of Caverna (obviously). The game comes with some wood tokens and some cardboard tokens.

The theme is ok.

Gameplay is fun. In every turn you have to choose and execute one of the available actions. A new action will appear in each round and they appear at random as they do in Agricola/Caverna. Every time you execute an action, it is unavailable until the next round so this simulates the Worker Placement mechanism very well. The goal of the game is to furnish your cave with the most valuable tiles and/or to amass gold, nothing else gives VPs. The decision of which tile to pick isn’t obvious as you have to consider various things: 1. The cost of the tile. 2. The wall placement condition of the tile. 3. The effect of the tile. 4. The VPs that the tiles provides.

There is an spatial puzzle to solve with the walls and they are limited. I really like this mechanism.

The game ends way too quickly and you are left with the feeling that you could have done much more with one or two more turns, that tension is great and very reminiscent of Agricola. You get the feeling of having to accomplish a lot with very few actions/resources.

It seems the game has a lot of replayability as each game will have different tiles available to furnish. They appear at random.

There is luck in the way the cavern tiles appear, but as the game plays so fast, I don’t mind it much.

Bottom line, Caverna: Cave vs Cave is a better game than I was expecting (I didn’t like Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small that much but after playing this one I want to revisit it) and a much better game (for me) than Caverna (although I somewhat dislike Caverna and I LOVE Agricola) . I´m still undecided if I should keep it or not but I will give it another spin before deciding. Caverna: Cave vs Cave has fun and interesting choices in a very short time frame. With more plays the rating could go either way. Unlike Caverna, every game of Caverna: Cave vs Cave will have different options available right from the beginning, a huge plus for me (high replayability).

2017-11-17 - My rating for this could go up with time, or it could go the other way. This is an interesting action drafting game, and it's fun to excavate your cave and build rooms. I'm concerned about replayability, though. The action availability is randomized, but I think the game could still start to feel samey after a few plays. We'll see.

RATING: 7
Just like [thing=119890][/thing], Cave vs. Cave does a very good job of shrinking and streamlining a complex euro into a relatively short, playable replica. In some ways, I feel that Cave vs. Cave is the more creative implementation which succeeds in creating intertwined mechanisms that does something essentially different than its source. Players draft actions in order to collect resources, clear rubble from their caves (which are flipped to reveal rooms either player can build), and build or activate rooms. At game's end, players get points for gold collected and the value of rooms built. The problem with these sorts of games is that the variety of rooms and actions (and scoring methods) is limited and so is the replayability. It is a game that will be fun for a while, but at some point will fade quickly unless expansions come out with a plethora of new rooms to keep it changeable. Good for now, but I could see myself getting tired of it, dropping it to a 6 and selling it at some point. We'll see what expansions might bring.

Better than the older brother and also better than the other small box reimplementations for Agricola and Le Havre. Worker placements are not my cup of tea but the relatively short playtime is advantageous for the game.

This is the conundrum of Cave vs Cave: experience with Caverna is required to fully appreciate what Cave vs Cave is doing, but that experience reveals Cave vs Cave as a much lighter alternative. Cave vs Cave is still very good, and at 40 minutes play time will hit our table more often than Caverna. It doesn't replace Caverna in the same way 7 Wonders Duel did 7 Wonders.

Despite what other people have commented this game is boring, there is a mechanism there and it does work but that is about it. I got the feeling that the game is just bare bones with no flesh, I have played it 5 times 2 player and twice solo so I feel I have given it a fair shot and as far as I am concerned the lack of variety in play and tile actions make this a dull and repetitive game.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This is a fine game in the series but the 2 player Agricola is far more interesting to me. Don't see myself returning to play this one even with likely upcoming expansions. Doesn't feel like I'm building as much in this one, perhaps because resources are tracked in a much more boring fashion despite it being more practical. The game will likely revolve around which rooms become available in a timely fashion for opponents.

If you like Agricola All Creatures Big and Small and want something a little bit more complex, has more engine building, and has actually some variability from game to game I think you'll love Cave vs. Cave. However, for someone like me whose enthusiasm for ACBS faded quickly while I like the variability in Cave vs. Cave, the spatial aspect, and the engine building, the constant converting of resources to other resources made it feel incredibly soulless. Also, unless you are specifically looking to fill a short 2 player niche, it doesn't really do anything to make itself stand out. Not a bad game, but it is lost in a sea of more exciting games for me.

Pretty obviously a mash-up of Uwe's other 2P games, Cave v Cave can't exactly claim startling originality, and there is perhaps a little too much stepping on toes for you to develop a proper strategy. But it has echoes of the bigger game in a way that ACBaS and Inland Port fail to deliver. The 1P variant is a bonus

[b]Caverna: Cave vs Cave[/b] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6/8):[/COLOR]

[i]Uwe Rosenberg is by far my favorite board game designer and based on how much I enjoyed what he pulled off with Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small I was excited to play the new 2p version of Caverna. 

Cave vs. Cave distills Caverna down to the excavating and room building of your cave. It makes sense that all of the animal husbandry/farming is removed since Agricola: All Creatures already handles that. On the plus side there is built in variability that wasn't* there in All Creaures [i](*without expansions)[/i] or Le Havre: Inland Port because the tiles you excavate from your board have the rooms you can build on the other side. Therefore, each game most* of the rooms will come out in a random order [i](*there are six starting rooms that are available each game)[/i]. Unfortunately Cave vs. Cave still suffers the same fate as All Creatures and Inland Port; due to the scaled down nature of these 2p only games there are limited strategies to explore with the base game of Cave vs. Cave and as such Caverna: Cave vs. Cave is a straight forward resource conversion game. However; based on the IP, I'd be shocked if expansions aren't already in the works. I'm interested to see how the game may change if expansion(s) are released, especially since the Agricola : All Creatures expansions added so much to the base game.   

For now Caverna: Cave vs. Cave still has some plays left, but I could see it fizzling out after a dozen or so plays unless new content is released. As of now I would recommend the game for hardcore Uwe fans, but I think an expansion is necessary for the game to really shine. As of now I'd rate the 2p versions of Uwe's heavy games in the following order: Agricola: All Creatures + expansions -> Cavrena: Cave vs. Cave -> Le Havre: Inland Port [i](which while fun for a few plays has never gotten a much needed expansion)[/i].[/i]

I've only played the solo version a couple of times. It's a good game where you puzzle which actions are best to take. It has a nice balance between thinky-ness and comfortable playing.

On a side note: I have the feeling some rooms are overpowered (like the gold for wall-building room), but that could just be a first impression.

It's a very good re-implementation of Caverna in the sense that it has some unique features which are nice.

Aug. 2017- After three games, I'd say that it's terrific.  Better than the Agricola 2-player game All Creatures Big & Small because:
-you don't have so many resources and animals to move around and
-it has more variety without adding any expansions

My initial rating is an "8."

Prefer this 2-player Uwe implementation over All Creatures Big and Small, and also better than the overhyped 7 Wonders Duel (it's fine but I don't get why it's is so so popular) and overhyped Patchwork (also fine, but basically a simplified version of Knizia's Carcassonne the Castle).  CvC really feels like it adds some novel aspects and improvements to the Caverna system, with the way you have to take actions to activate rooms but blue rooms trigger off certain actions, and how new rooms become available as you excavate, so you never know what strategy you will pursue each game. My only complaint is that the wall requirement for room building seems tacked on, and while I see the reason for making another way that it is difficult to build the higher scoring rooms rather than just upping the cost, I just doesn't really make any thematic sense.  I'm not sure how I would have designed it better, but the wall-requirement to build a room, building walls, rotating the tiles after being built, removing walls for gold, etc. was my least favorite part of the game.  I guess I also didn't like that you could max out at 19 gold (we may have been wrong about that rule), and perhaps wished there were more complex ways to score points than just gold and rooms' base points (like the scoring rooms in Caverna that score off the amount of resources you have or adjacency to other types of rooms).

RATING: 7
It's a nice, moderate difficulty two-player game. I don't feel that it has the same depth of decision making as Caverna or Agricola and part of me feels that the loss of the "feed your people" mechanic removes some of the intensity from the game and it ends up, if anything, feeling a bit too casual (considering the complexity).

Interesting distillation of Caverna full game, with solid gameplay at solo and 2player variety. 

The game overall felt pretty basic and didnt offer anything new to really hold my interest.

Enjoying this more than Caverna. Wishing there were a few more action selection tiles so not all were in every game, but not a big deal since there is still a lot of variability to keep replay value high.

I like that it's built for two players and has quick set-up.  Some choices, but narrow enough for fast game play.  A missed opportunity was to have more tiles than needed for game in order to increase different game types and therefore longevity.

($F) At first I thought "Caverna plays two..." then I realized that this two player version could probably be played in the time it takes to set up normal Caverna...

Probably an 8, but I want to run it a few more times and see how well it wears.  Will it come down to a limited number of terrific combinations, or will it really pay off on enough different approaches that you can just make up a new one as you go along and have a chance of winning with it.

Solidly good, but I can't help but think I'd rather play 2-player Caverna, and I already have that.

[Mayfair 2017 Edition] {Cave; action-drafting, resources-management; 2p}  Cave vs Cave (CvC) is a typical Uwe game.  You always want to do more actions than you can.   And there are many resources to handle.  It is a fast-paced and fun 2p games.  There is a good competition in rooms, esp. you cannot use the room actions of the other player,

This game requires a good tempo, facing the unknown sequence of room and action availability.  So, you always have to prepare your cave and your resources for the building rooms.  Andy, some resources (such as wood and stone) are more important than others in building a room.

It is easy to teach and set up this game.  But it will need a few games to understand the potential of room tiles and know the strength of certain combos.

I don't see a material advantage for the first game. This game is just fine.

Replayability is good due to the randomness, but it seems strategy variety is limited; anyway, expansions are coming, we can see more actions.

The box and tiles are colorful but the illustration is disappointing.  There are no illustration at all for the room tiles!   The resources track is too small to hold all markers at the same row (and it will happen).

My preference: Agricola 2p > Caverna 2p > Le Havre 2p

Played this several times solo and love it. It has enough variability. I want to play it again and again.

I am looking forward to play it with 2 players.

Edit: Played this several times with two players as well. After 30+ plays in three weeks I'm still not tired playing it!

More complex than the mini version of Agricola, which is both good and bad. All in all they are fairly equal (although quite different).

Rated as solo game. It's pretty okay. I like that it's short, you build an engine, and watch it run. Doesn't overstay its welcome, and setup/teardown/replay is pretty fast, and replayability is limited, but has a decent number of plays (30+) before it goes past the unique game limit

Need to play this a few more times, but initial ranking is a 7. The game plays quickly and smoothly. I am a bit concerned at how strong the "Shelf" room is at the start of the game - it can be built immediately and used often to generate at least 4 goods, as wheat and flax can always be traded in for food, and up to 8 goods if you are already at zero on the other two commodities. None of the other staring tiles seem anywhere near as powerful. Time will tell, but so far I'm finding the game enjoyable.

We felt like we got some rules wrong.  We didnt realize how important rotating the tiles was.  Need to try again.

RATING: N/A
First play impression: played once solo to learn the game and played a two-player game. The solo game is awful and should only be used when learning the game. It's a lazy tacked-on variant.

The real game (two players) is excellent. Resources are tight and there are multiple paths to take. Where Agricola: All Creatures is all about managing your animals, this game is about maximizing your room tiles and has slightly more focus on combos. You can activate your room tiles in a preferred order to generate some resources and then spend them for something better at the same time.

Really no complaints so far. It plays in about the same amount of time as All Creatures and offers a different enough experience.

Very mathy, the theme quickly fades away when you're just doing math calculations for your resources and victory points. The lack of variable actions means that it loses the interactivity of competing for actions since they are all so similar they do almost the same thing.

Only played sologame but some AP and replayability issues shine through. In elegance and playability it's not up there with all creatures big and small and patchwork when looking at Uwes 2p games. Will likely not be a permanent addition to my collection even though it is entertaining.

The very essence of boring and "meh". It's a perfectly well-designed euro, it's just that there's nothing about it that would make me want to play it again. And I'm not sure how replayable this game is - it needs at least one small expansion with new tiles.

Basically a nice looking puzzle that is quick to set up, will change each game depending on order of action tiles revealed and which rooms are revealed. Great as two player and solo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Streamlined Caverna-lite for two that focuses on cave dwelling building without adventures and a reduced role of livestock and harvesting.  Gobs of bits and pieces are reduced to tracking levels on player boards.  The biggest change is having buildings limited and becoming available when revealed from the two-sided cave tiles as they are excavated. This is fun.  Also adds a walls puzzle for placing rooms on your personal cave board.  I love original Caverna but it never makes it to the table because of the long setup and play time and all the different types of landscape pieces. I prefer having this approach to figure out room combinations depending on what comes available versus wide open with everything available from the start.  I wonder if four could play this version if we bought two games?

I love Caverna and Agricola. I agree that Agricola: All Creatures Big and Small is a worthwhile game in and of itself, all the more so for someone who knows and likes the base Agricola. And since Caverna trumps Agricola in my personal preference, C:CvC requires no hyping up for me :laugh:

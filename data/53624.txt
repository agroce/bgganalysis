Its a SOS game engine, which is decent most of the time. But its a game of the French and Indian War so for me, it gains points for the theme.

RATING: 8
A little more complicated than even Zulus on the Ramparts, but I enjoy that. Also easier than Zulus so far - I've won more often than not. I really like having the individual leaders attached to each front, it makes the game tell even more of a story. The series continues to evolve in terrific directions. Due to all the reshuffling this is the first of the line I am considering sleeving.

Good solitaire design. You really feel strangled by the enemy. The dice and luck-of-the-draw of the cards can have a devastating effect on the game, which is too bad.

RATING: 9
Seems to have potential, but, despite being a so-called light game with only 8 pages of rules, I find it somewhat confusing.  I'm shelving it for now with a potential to reattempt at a later date.  Rated 5.5.

Update: starting to get the hang of it, though somewhat fiddly regarding which cards go in which piles after use.  Will play again.   Upgrading rating to 6.75.

Update: the card disposition is still really annoying me, but I'm becoming addicted.   There's no way this game ends in 25 minutes, especially if you're doing well.   Upgrading to 8.5.

Update: I'm now addicted.   Won a 3 hour long game decisively.   Rating increased to 9.

When I play other titles in the States of Siege system, one game is never enough - after setup, I usually play several sessions.  With EiA, one game is enough and I'm ready to put it up.  It isn't bad - and is quite a bit different than others in the series.  Of course, card draws can make or break in this system, but seems much more-so with EiA - if you have a bad commander(s) and the Brits have a top leader, there is little you can do but watch them march to victory.

RATING: N/A
Sleeved.  I normally sleeve to protect the cards, but these cards needed sleeves just to be handled comfortably.  I can't imagine trying to shuffle these cards without sleeves as the cards more or less stick to one another.  It's not that they are sticky, it's the finish or lack there of that is responsible.  Now, I just have to get around to playing it.

RATING: 9
     This is a highly entertaining game which fits well within the historical parameters of the Seven Years War in Ameriaca, but allows for plenty of variation from the exact flow of events.  It allows the palyer to make meaningful decisions which balance immediate needs with planning for future needs.  For example, do I attack now to push advancing armies away or should I spend my limited action points on forts or trading points which will have later benefits?

RATING: 8
Rating (7.5) based on first 3 plays and subject to change.  I lost the first game, the won the next 2, rather easily.  I hope it gets a bit more tense as I continue playing, and I've just seen "weird" card orders!  Rating raised 1/2 point after playing 3 more games and going 1-2.

RATING: 8.5
Just acquired 3/5/2015.
This is a game of extremes.  Either you suffer crushing, swift defeat or the game goes on for a long time.  The length seems to be dependent on three things:
1. How quick the Seven Years War begins
2. How quickly British leaders get into the game.
3. How quickly Montclam comes into the game.

That being said, the game is a lot of fun with a lot of replayability.  :)

RATING: 8
There is nothing wrong with the game but I think that the problem is that I've played too many of the States of Siege (SoS) games (Ottoman Sunset, Zulus on the Ramparts, Red October (?), Levee en Masse), and after a while the game mechanic has worn on me.  I like Ottoman Sunset too much, and while I like the variable commanders in this one, it's not one I'll pull off the shelf too often.  Rating may well have been different if this was my first introduction to the SoS series.***I got this game off the shelf after a year or so and after repeated plays I've increased the rating from a 7 to an 8 (also better with the expansion).  I feel like the rules have an inexplicably steep learning curve, but the game is fun and challenging once you get a handle on them.  Good player choices in this one.

RATING: 9
I think this is [b]the best game[/b] thus far [b]of the series[/b].  It brings the SoS out of its light-game genre and into a mainstream level of wargaming complexity, which is both a strength and a weakness I guess.  For the experienced wargamer that is interested in solitaire games, I think the choice is a no-brainer, this is the cream of the crop and has become one of my favorite solitaire games.  Even for the wargaming initiate, I don't think there are many complex concepts that will cause trouble, but if you like solitaire games and want a "gaming experience" that isn't monotonous, this game is for you too!

I am giving this game a [b]9 out of 10[/b], even I can't believe I am giving a 9 to a State of Siege game, I guess I'll be skiing in hell soon.

[b]+9 [/b]for the best application of the State of Siege system thus far, the veteran designer (Joseph Miranda) has manage to amalgamate many different mechanisms and layers of strategies to give the original SoS system depth in an elegant package.  You can readily see his extensive wargame designing experience expressed in this version of SoS.  Hats off to the man!

[b]-1[/b] for components, this game deserves better!

Picked this up in the April 2010 UK Maths Trade. Looks good  a solitaire game of the French Indian Wars. Nice production values. Have just played this and found it very engaging. First test game was troubled by a couple of rule hangups but following a rules re-read things seem good. I am impressed with the production and the game play is very engaging.

I'm discovering this game, so my rating may evolve as i will play more of it.

The game is quite simple to play but the player is faced with some harsh decisions to make, so the situation quickly grows tense.

A very good point is that each victory in battle is a great satisfaction, even when ultimately losing the game.

My initial rating was 8. I lowered it to 7 because the game offers few variations.

RATING: 8.67
 I like because there are several kinds of cards: action cards, provincials, British events, leaders, world events...etc. It gives to the game a big variety.

 The cards are not difficult to deal with: they can be removed, discarded, in the tableau,  bottomed or in your hand. Easy. A clever way to use the several cards in several ways.

 The tactical battles are funny. You have options to use your cards according to your necessities earlier or later.

 The gameplay is simple but clever. I really like this one.  I have only played with the expansion.

Not as compelling as Zulus on the Ramparts, but still a decent solo game.  Doesn't seem to quite match the theme with Montcalm teleporting about the map willy-nilly.  I got a decisive win with 24 points the first go, but probably got lucky.

This one has a fair amount of depth in the rules for this particular game system. The rules are pretty clear, too, although upon first play I had to wade carefully through the rulebook, which took a long time. I'd rate the complexity as light-medium to medium. I like the combat system and how forts work for defense and trading posts work for supply and victory points. I also like the variance in ratings of specific leaders, which works to vary combat outcomes.

A brilliant solitaire design. Lots of history and variety, due mainly the deck-of-cards system. I generally don't like cards in wargames, but I have to admit this works and was an enjoyable diversion.

I enjoy this one much more than the other early States of Siege games.  There is a remarkable amount of history packed in, the rise and fall of the various leaders adds variety and drama, there is less luck in the application of the event cards and player choices, and I can actually win it sometimes.  It's not Wilderness War, but it's pretty good.

SOLO GAME OF FRENCH & INDIAN WAR
[5-10-2014] Game two still and a few questions but flowed much more smoothly.  French were about to be overwhelmed but then Montcalm made a late but very timely appearance.  This game generates a great narrative once you have grasped the mechanics.
[5-9-2014] Very promising little game based on one learning play so far.  French crushed.  My first States of Siege Victory Points Game.   Simple components with interesting gameplay.  A bit of a throwback to the 80's Metagaming Microgame series in concept.

Best of the States of Siege games, primarily because it gives you non-trivial choices.  The mechanics managing the commanders and their reputation are very good.  Another unexpected Miranda success, much better than his recent Decision Games chum.

I found this one to be a little too repetitive and physically fiddly to enjoy wholeheartedly; it's a bit of a slog through the same actions again and again, which can be a problem with the States of Siege series.

I participated in limited playtesting, and thought it was just OK.

Leader cards add a different feel and element.

Important errata item (noted in the expansion) that Forts and Trading Posts cannot be rebuilt.

Overall, nice feel and a decent game but not one of the better SoS titles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Unique among States of Siege games in the way the various leaders on both sides in the French and Indian War have dynamic tactical abilities that rise or fall according to their individual military successes (or failures).  Watch Langlade elevate himself from mediocrity as he terrorizes colonials in the Ohio Valley!  See Montcalm lead his legions in repulsing British excursions up the St. Lawrence!  Hope that Wolfe isn't commissioned before New France is suitably fortified!

After Soviet Dawn (which was great) this game series has started to go awry. EiA has great components but the solitaire player is constantly rechecking the rulebook; one has to juggle many things at any given moment, the positions in which you have to place cards is ambiguous but crucial. There is just too much going on at the same moment for a solitaire boardgame, especially one that has vague resemblance to Israeli Independence, a brilliant game which after the first two plays you NEVER have to look at the rules again. Clever play can exploit a gigantic rules hole (never, if possible, kill off British leaders!) which virtually guarantees a French (player) victory. Expansion kit fixes this, but at the expense of more complexity and headaches. Just played it again -- The reason State of Siege games appeal to me is that I want to be able to crack one open and not have to look at the rulebook. Empires in America is a totally different experience. There's no fun in constantly consulting an appallingly ambiguous rulebook (which cards can I use and when? What exactly does "remove" a leader mean [same as "discard"?]? Which DRM's apply? Do rallied leaders get their battallions back or do I have to rebuild them with action points? Is a bottomed card placed at the top or the bottom of the bottomed pile?). Rules are a total train-wreck; every rule in this game refers to some other rule(s) but rarely makes the reference explicit. A complete failure as a game. Downgraded to 3.

Got it out on the table and set up to play, but just couldn't find the interest to actually play it.  Unhappy with myself for spending the same money I would for a higher production value game on this single player print and play (nearly) one.

RATING: 10
I officially like this game.  Even more than the previous 3 SoS games, EiA really develops like a story with various British Leaders moving towards Montreal and the Player sending his forces to ambush them in the wilderness or defend the fortresses.  The game does have slightly more complexity in the player actions and the manipulation of the deck compared to the previous games; cards, for example, can be in one of six places: they can be on the Tableau, in your hand, in the Draw Pile, Bottomed, Removed, or Discarded.  But once that concept is understood, the game becomes very subtle and fun!

Update: Half a dozen years on, and this is still one of my favorite games.  There's a balance between a fun game and the historical narrative being created by play that I love.  And no matter how badly I'm losing, I still feel invested in the effort; you never can tell when you're going to get that opportunity to turn the game around.

A great solo game. The ever-approaching British troops can make for a stressful time. I have found the luck-of-the-draw can swing the game quite a bit, but that's not necessarily a bad thing in a quick(ish) solo game. The 2nd edition looks beautiful, but the 1st edition works well enough for me!

Expansion bought, need to try it out.

Another winner in this series.  This one is a bit lighter than the others.  There is also less history with the cards.

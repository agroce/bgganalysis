I really wanted to like this one more than I do.  I found it to be a little too luck-driven for my tastes.  There were a few turns were I got cut out from doing any actions because I got outbid or tied on everything.  It is a nicely produced game (not sure why all other SJG games are shit).  It has some fun mechanics, but I don't see much real skill in it. I am also thinking that whoever gets the early lead in tokens can just keep claiming the token generating spots, and thus continue taking tokens and winning bids.

Here is another game that I absolutely love that others hate or at least dislike because it is a Steve Jackson game.  There is a lot of bluffing and second guessing your opponents which sometimes causes wasted turns but, turns of control sway easily.

This is a fun four-player game. Trying to anticipate what others may do -- it's filled with massive "second-guess complex". It's a nice, quick play -- about 45 minutes to an hour if you move along. Fun.

N-dimenisional rock paper scissors is the mechanic to perform area control.  It is filler material, but gets repetetive and runs about 15-20 minutes too long for my taste.  If I played it again, I would suggest using a non player marker to block out areas that had ties to speed the game up a tad.

RATING: 8
This game is straight up fun if you like bidding and guessing what your friends will do.  It's area control.  The rules and mechanics are simple and straightforward.  As you play a game, a few strong strategies will emerge and dominate for a few turns before counters are developed and implemented.  The game flows quickly, and there's very little down time.  The player screens are remarkably high-quality and prevent wandering eyes as you set up your bids each turn.

RATING: 10
Pros
- Blind bidding is really fun
- Getting inside your opponents head and outplaying them
- Making a gamble on a spot, hoping nobody goes there
- Moving someone's cubes off the board and laughing in their face
- Seeing your opponents all tie for a spot so nobody gets anything 
- Finding the best strategy since it changes every time and with different players
- Direct interaction with swapping and replacing cubes
- Plays in about an hour
- Accessible to non-gamers

Cons
- You have to keep up with the score track as you go every time someone gets "support" so it's a little maintenance, but it's easy.

A fun bidding game with three resources to manage and many paths to victory. Probably scales weirdly to number of players, as blind bidding requires you to predict, at least to some extent, the actions of the other players, so I should probably mention that my rating is based solely on plays with 4. No clear dominant strategy, and a competent player should be able to derail any "engine".

Nice light area-control game. Players use 3 kinds of resources (gold, blackmail, force) to secretly bid for the use of different characters. Each characters give different bonuses to the winner. Simple rules, nice shiny components, plays in about 40 minutes. Gameplay is a bit chaotic but the game flows well. The theme is almost non-existant.

Blind bidding, the best that I have seen it. A lot of fun, though I feel it suffers with too many people, as it is not a game that helps the loser catch up, and if you go a couple rounds in a row with the consolation 5 coins you will probably never have much to bid with again.

Not good. Blind bidding punishes players for no reason at all. Combined with a lot of randomness and a lack of a catchup mechanism = A very unusual combination for an area control euro. It's only saving grace is that it is over very fast and can scratch the area control itch. 

Anyone not a fan of area control games, just avoid it.

Probably the best pure game in the entire Steve Jackson library, this is an intuitive and masterful use of bidding and area control, which makes for a wonderful gateway to players new to the mechanics. The very cutthroat nature of the actions, especially characters like the Spy on the bidding board, creates an added level of tension as you're trying to out think the opponents' bids and ensure that you can win some bidding tokens for future auctions.

It isn't super strong on components or theme, but it's damn fun, not to mention timeless. I look forward to seeing what the expansions offer.

A rock-paper-scissors mechanic where each player has a variable number of rocks, paper and scissors that they allocate in secret to different spaces. Naturally that leads to lots of guessing what your opponents will do and since ties are "everyone loses" a bad guess can be painful.

While the game doesn't have any mechanical luck, it is a far cry from anything strategic/tactical.

Initial Impression: This game is surprisingly well produced for a SJG. At its heart, the game uses a rock/paper/sissors style mechanism for conflict resolution. Players turns consist of blind bidding their resources in order to control areas on the main board and score VPs. The fun is in guessing and second guessing what your opponent will do.

Terrible guessing game, hated by me and the three euro-friendly gamers I was with. 
Hey - let's play a game where if you guess the same as someone else (and we were surprised how many times this happened) then neither of you can do anything.
The winning person's strategy was just to choose the points scoring middle people most of the time and she won by the proverbial mile, she lapped two of us. But she doesn't want to paly it again either.

RATING: N/A
This game is definitely not for everyone.  It has a lot to do with your ability to bluff and read others.  This is a confidence game, your goal is to con your opponents into thinking you play the spy so they will pay more for it.  I like the player interaction.  When playing the expansion with a full 6 players there was a lot of taunting and silliness.  Some people hated it, others, like me, loved the heck out of it.  It boils down to the basic concept, if you like poker and games where your skill at reading others are fun for you,then this is a brilliant game.  If you would rather let your actions on the board talk for themselves, then by all means skip this one as it is more about player interaction.

RATING: 4
Every turn in this game is all about simultaneous selection and trying to base your moves off of what your opponents are doing. Ordinarily I don't mind games like that, but there are just too many stinking options in Revolution, and you can spread yourself out so much. Suddenly it shifts from being a "guess their moves" game into a "randomly pick and hope for the best" game. Sure you can look at what your opponents want, and try to outbid them, but if you are wrong you've lost what you bid and basically wasted your turn. It feels like you could use a random number generator to determine where you will play and just hope that others didn't randomly select to play on the same places. Also, this game started to feel repetitive before we were even halfway done. There are so few genuine strategic decisions in Revolution since everything is dependent on whether luck benefits you in the random selection phase.  Also there is a massive chance for a runaway leader, and very little opportunity to stop them. In my one game the first place player literally lapped everyone else on the scoreboard. I can't say I hated Revolution, but I certainly don't have any interest in playing it again.

Not exactly a blind bidding game (since you know what the others have to bid with), but close enough for me to consider it random.  Win goes to the best guesser and/or the one who can get the most force/blackmail chits.  Once a player is stuck with all gold it's hard to get anything more useful.  Also, the continual bidding gets tiresome quickly; I would have liked another mechanic or two mixed in.  Bleah.

Hmmm! Well that was a bit of a surprise, Steve Jackson does area majority. Of course, being an SJ game it has to have some sort of chaos in it, and blind bidding is the chaotic element in this game. That being said, there is a fair amount of second guessing you can do to influence the outcome.

All in all, not a bad game, it just did not feel very Steve Jacksony.

A fun family game. It is fairly easy to teach mechanically, but strategy takes longer to figure out. Every player will have ups and downs: as an experienced player against a table of newbies, I've still managed to have turns where little pans out and I'm stuck with 5 gold to start my next turn. But better players can keep that from happening too often, and recover if it does.

I found the blind bidding in this game too chaotic. Placing your tokens randomly could yield better results that trying to outsmart your opponents. The main problem, however, is that the rich get richer: a good turn equals more bidding power for next turn, and conversely, a bad turn usually translates into successive bad turns. In my only play there was a huge runaway leader problem; comments from other people suggest this is the norm, not an exception. Components are great, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Loved this so far (2 plays). However, I wonder when the strategies we play will tend to circle 'round again and again. With the randomness being the bids of your fellow players, playing with the same folks over and over might lead to similar gameplay. 

That aside, this is a great great bidding game!

One of the long line of games whose gameplay basically boils down to nothing but auctions, again and again. This is mildly amusing for twenty minutes, but becomes tedious if you have to do it for an hour. As has been widely discussed on BGG, the rules as written, where players always lose their losing bids, create a total nightmare of a game which should be avoided at all costs. 

Even still, with the variant, the game slows to a crawl towards the end of the game, when all players generally just want the Apothecary and Spy because there are relatively few spots still under contention. If there were a way to make this game last just 20-30 minutes, I'd consider keeping but as it is, this is just way too long and repetitive. Sold.

I've never much cared for simultaneous action selection games where you're trying to outguess your opponents for the right to actions, so it's no surprise to me that I didn't care for this one a whole lot.  Players can get especially boned in the first turn, where everyone has the same resources to spend.  Guess wrong, and you get left with nothing while other players have better resources to bid with.

However, if you don't mind the crapshoot of guessing/double-guessing what other players are going to do, there's not a bad little game here.  You bid resources on spaces that will score you points, get you more resources to bid with next turn, and also put cubes on the board for some area majority action.  Fitting with the game, there is the added chaos of some spaces allowing you to manipulate the area-majority cubes on the board!

I won the game I played, but really didn't feel like I had outplayed anyone... just felt like I got a little luckier.  Overall, this isn't so terrible for a 30 minute game though, so I wouldn't be totally opposed to playing again even though it's not my cup of tea.

RATING: N/A
Interesting game, but I am not sure about the blind bidding aspect each round. With one play, I am left thinking about the  balance between going for a straight support strategy versus a building strategy and the balance between getting "good" tokens to bid with over just gold. It will take a few more plays for me to figure out if these interesting decisions are outweighed by what feels like a random bidding element.

Heh, more fun than I imagined! And more viable strategies than I expected. I was doing terribly and maximized a pathetic but surprisingly fruitful dash for points all game---while others monopolized the cubes in the buildings and crushed me with wealth and power. But the key to the whole thing was that it all felt very---and conistantly---FUN. 

Perfect for the high school game club atmosphere where I play and support the gaming hobby.

So simple, yet so good.  Blind bidding for action spaces mixed with "Advanced rock, paper, scissors" to determine the winners.  This game uses Force, Blackmail and Gold, powered in that order.  However, the gold does not loop back around to beat force as is the case of R-P-S.  This iniquity is instead handled by the spots on the board that limit which of the three you can bid with.  Area control determines end game scoring.  Neat design idea that has you trying to read the other players to figure out which actions they are trying to obtain.  Lots of double-think in this one.  Get an expansion, because it's [b]best with 5 or 6.[/b]

I can easily describe what I liked about this game: exploring the system and finding efficient action-chains which bootstrapped into better/more bidding tokens. That was very engaging, for the first half of the game I played.

What I disliked is more varied. I wish it had been shorter, both in play-time and in "when does the game end?" rules. (We had one empty cube slot which resulted in two whole extra turns.) I'd have liked more variance in action utility between players, improving the ability to guess how badly someone might want a particular action. I'd have liked fewer things to compete over (or the ability to compete over more of them), but with some sort of minor compensation for 2nd place. I'd have liked board play more involved than a bunch of parallel area-majority contests.

Making "all-pay blind-bidding" into a good, >5-minute game is a very high hurdle, so perhaps it's not surprising that Revolution! stumbles.

This game is a action selection that has the pick on the leader element like Steve Jacksons other game Munchkin.

Initial 7 rating is after only one play, however having played Courtiere and looking into DuBarry's design line, I can see how this one really was his lightning in a bottle.

Acquired via math trade having never played...glad I did.

I'm predisposed towards simultaneous selection games anyway, but this is a great implementation of the mechanic because that's pretty much the entire game. The evolving board layout influences your decisions and that's about it. Plays quick and gives a nice euro feel from a game company known for anything but.

RATING: 6
Great intro to blind bidding and area control with a dab of negotiation. The biggest sore spot for some players is that your bid may fail and you lose the action that turn, but that is part of the challenge of the game.

Components are good quality but the game is quite pricey if you look to add the expansion. The theme is rather loosely tied to the gameplay but the art is okay.

Not sure how replayable this game is but with experienced players the mind games and strategy will change over time.

Got this for Christmas in 2012 and finally got it to the table in May 2013.  It's not our first blind-bidding game (Dungeon Petz was), but it's definitely the strongest example of a blind-bidding game that we now own.  With only one play so far it's hard to tell how much we'll like this game moving forward, but I'm eager to get it to the table again soon.

Revolution is about the only Steve Jackson game I like.  I frequently hear that it's too much about luck, and not really a game of observation and deduction.

Finally! An amazing board game from SJ Games! I have always enjoyed playing their games, but there was something missing, something that would get them taken seriously by true board gamers . . . this is it. The secret bidding mechanic of the game is excellent. It allows for new players to jump right in, but more experienced players to build strategies. There are a couple strategies that can be ridiculous . . . if left unchecked. Overall, the game is well balanced and it often comes closer than one might expect considering all the end game points. The expansion promises to add even more!

[1 play] The nicest thing I can say about this game is that if I were compelled by circumstances to play it again, it would be less unpleasant than many other games for which I have equally little enthusiasm.  
	The first thing I didn't like about Revolution! was the bland, abstracted theme.  My first question for the rules explainer was "where and when," but unfortunately there is no answer.  So many thematic possibilities in the idea of a revolution, but this game doesn't lock in on any of them.  There really is no thematic coherence and nothing revolutionary going on here.
	This game managed to give me a feeling of futility on two contradictory levels: when another player has control of something, it doesn't seem like you have any hope of taking it over, but when you have control of something, it doesn't seem like you have any hope of keeping it.  There really wasn't as much conflict and struggle for control as I had initially expected, because once people get early leads, it quickly starts to seem pointless to challenge them.  Because each section of the board is winner-take-all, it's easy to put out lots of cubes and yet accomplish nothing.  
	As one of the other players remarked, it's like scissors-paper-stone--but without the strategic interest of scissors-paper-stone, because the circuit is broken.  Force beats blackmail, blackmail beats gold, but gold doesn't beat anything, as those of us who spent much of the game with nothing but mercy gold quickly learned.  
	You're sort of trying to second-guess what other players are going to choose, so that you can concentrate where you can win, but the whole thing is so bland that it's not that clear what's going to be advantageous to whom.  It's easy to have a completely null turn by just being outbid everywhere you go.  Really, the more I think about this game, the more the major motif seems to be futility.

I generally hate hate hate blind bidding games, but I enjoyed this one. The hierarchical currencies for the auction is very clever, and I found I had a reasonable amount of control for a b-b game. I could take a turn to load up and then fire on the next turn. The psychological play was fun too as you learn what each other player's "top limit" seems to be and then top them. I won many an auction by one extra gold.

There are 15 (IIRC) spaces up for auction which you bid for secretly behind a screen and then all reveal at once. The currencies are Force which trumps Blackmail which trumps Gold. Thing is, some spots can't be forced, blackmailed, or either (i.e., only Gold). Also, ties are broken by the hierarchy: a Force and a gold beats a Force, a Force and two gold beats a Force and a gold, etc. When you win an auction, you get some combo of points, additional resources for bidding next turn, and/or to place/move a dude on the board. Each turn the only resource you get automatically is gold, so if you didn't win any Force or Blackmail, you'll need to spend a turn using your gold to try to get some to set yourself up for the turn after. You need to find the rhythm and pick your moments.

You can score from the auctions as well as the areas you're fighting over. The areas heavily influence the scoring, though, and they vary greatly in points. I wonder if you have to win the biggest area each time to win the game or if you can try another path.

From one play: there are three kinds of money, 12 placements to bid on , and some kinds of money cannot be used for certain placements.  The game here is mostly about second guessing what your opponents will bid on and trying to bid on something else (lest you be outbid and lose your workers completely).  The actual board resources are not all that interesting, just some objective to fight over.

It looked like SJG finally put out something decent, and they actually have.  This is largely an area-control Euro, but it's got a really nasty bidding mechanism that screws you if you have a low bid or the exact same bid, which really forces you to think about what your opponents are likely to do.

RATING: 4
Very quick, basic RSP mechanism, with crude area control.

Did not enjoy for four reasons. 1. The rich get richer - if you had good early rounds, you can use your bonuses to cover more squares and win more bonuses. If you start poorly there's no way back, with few bonuses you are very limited where you can succeed. 2. There's no point in being second in a location. When one player has a clear majority, there's no point in the others trying to get in there, since the leader there can easily keep ahead. So options in the game reduce quickly. 3. The board gets locked down - meaning when a player has one location sewn up, they can shift to another area easily, helping the rich stay rich. 4. Stinks with 3 players - There are only 7 locations. When players A and B do not compete and each concentrate on 2 locations, player C ends ups fighting them both and obviously cannot win more than one location.

I might play this again with 4 players, but not with 3.

Played 1 time with 3 players. I appreciate a few things about this blind-bidding/influence game, but still feel the game, overall, is lacklustre. I like the fact that the "currency" gets thrown out every turn; I like that "currency" is known ahead of time, and that helps you to deduce what your opponents might do; I like how well the actions seemed to be balanced.Combining blind-bidding (like Ys) with influence (like El Grande) was actually a very good idea, but the blind-bidding doesn't feel as interactive or interesting as Ys (since all bids for actions are behind a screen, and the influence lacks the dynamic regional interplay of El Grande. Also, the end game feels flawed as two moves can swing a game 95 points on the last turn!!! I think a second playing would confirm my feeling on this game and don't expect the rating will ever go up.

Shouldn't there be more action in a Revolution? Shouldn't it build to a climax? I have the feeling that at least one entire sub-system is missing. It's a bidding game with the winner slowly gaining control of various areas in the capitol city, Such as the market or the harbor. But even when you gain control nothing very dramatic happens. Not a bad game but it could be a lot better with an optional second or third avenue of advancement. Say gaining control of the bank lowers your opponent's influence in the market or in the harbor. Or gaining control of the fortress gains you more force or something along those lines. It's a typical Euro: big on mechanics, small on theme.

Secret bids to bribe people and get more influence for the next turn.  Good solid game, a shocking change from the crud that Steve Jackson usually puts out these days.

Normally I like bluffing games, but this one feels too easy for one or two players to get stuck behind.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I really wanted to like this game... but I have never been more frustrated with a game than I have with Revolution.  Once you fall behind, it seems impossible to catch up... and once you pull ahead, it seems almost impossible to be pulled back down.  I know I am doing something wrong since I have never come close to winning a game, but most people who I play with agree that it seems really difficult to catch up once you get unlucky and have 5 coins to use.
The main reason for the low rating is that Revolution fails a very important test that I use to judge games.  Does the person who comes in last place enjoy the game?  It is always a resounding 'NO!", whereas a game like Stone Age, everyone seems to have fun... even the guy who lost by 100 points.  Everyone should have fun playing a game... not just the people who are winning the games.

RATING: 4
Completely blind bidding. Nothing else there, so...blech.

I saw another comment that brought up Aladdin's Dragons, which is also blind bidding but is one of my favorite games. The other comment had it right -- in Aladdin's Dragons there is an element of bluffing and double-guessing that is completely missing here, making Revolution a much inferior game. 

I won by rolling cubes onto my board -- wherever the cubes landed, that's what I bid on. I still had to decide how much to bid on each square that the cube landed on. But playing randomly is definitely a good strategy.

The blind bidding feels random starting out, but once the game gets underway the relative values of the actions coalesce pretty well. Revolution still involves reading people to guess when they'll bluff, which isn't my strong suit. An elegant design, but not my favorite flavor.

RATING: 5
Revolution is a decent but very chaotic game of blind bidding. Try to predict where your opponents will place their bids and either outbid them or try to get something less popular at a cheap price. You're competing for 12 different actions, which just seems like too many - making the bidding feel like a crapshoot. I did enjoy playing, but I would much rather play Hoity Toity, Edel Stein & Reich, Money, For Sale, etc.

Nitpick #1: The endgame can become very boring if you're waiting to fill that one final building for several rounds. Nitpick #2: That's your box art? Really? Did you only have twenty minutes left until your print deadline? (Referring to the U.S. edition)

I’m quite surprised I like this one as much as I do. It’s a fast paced blind bidding game. There is a lot of double guessing in the game, but it didn’t feel that random when I played it with two other opponents. The problem I see is that you can be trapped for several rounds in a row. Another problem is that the end game can be a little long for its own good which is the reason we often enforce a house rule where the game ends when all but at least one building is full. All in all however, this is a fun quick game.

Interesting market entry for steve jackson games.  I'm glad to see them take this route.  Hopefully it's not an abandonment of their other highly themed titles (Still hoping for a Deluxe Ogre with GEV reprint).  Still, I think it's a market smart direction to branch their offerings with.  

This is a simple enough blind bidding/area control game.  It plays quick, so you could play several rounds in an evening and not burn out non-gamer company.  The components are nice enough, and keep the price comparatively reasonable, I suppose.  I liked the hand drawn almost comic like art.  It keeps the game feeling less heavy, which really fits as the game is not heavy and going to scare away family and friends who may not be as obsessed with games.  

I enjoyed it enough to perhaps buy a copy when I'm ready to buy something in the future.  Good on you SJG.  I hope it's a decision that pays off for you.

RATING: 7
It's similar to Citadels in that the entire game is just guessing what your opponents will do, bluffing, and double-think.  If you like that sort of game, you'll probably like this game a decent amount.  It's pretty random, though, at least with four people, and there were several turns during my first game in which I had nothing to do at all because of it.  But, it's amusing and really easy to grasp, and it definitely warrants another play.

Yuck.  I hate screens that hide actions.  Stupid game.  If you want to take an action and you think someone will stiyme you so you take the other action and someone decides to block you on the less good option than you should have taken the better option.  What-EVER.  This game is suckage.

This has a somewhat abstract feeling to it. Our first play suffered badly from a runaway leader (more points than everyone else combined). The second play was more balanced, but the winner seemed clear well before the end, too. I liked the feeling of the game, but luck plays a large roll in the bidding. What I like is that there are different paths to success.

Hidden bidding influence game where it's next to impossible to make any reasoned deductions about what other players might be doing. At the beginning the board is so wide open that bidding randomly is a reasonably valid strategy, and towards the end there's so few spaces left that it's more or less pointless wherever you bid. Not the worst experience I've ever had, but really almost no fun at all. No viva!

I prefer games in which you play more against the other players than the game itself, and this game definitely delivers on that. This game has no luck in it (at least, not of the dice-rolling variety), only strategy as you try to predict what your opponents might do. I really enjoy the level of strategy and bluffing involved.

RATING: 5
Not bad actually.  The main blind bidding mechanic is actually interesting enough, of course there is almost no control but that is blind bidding.  There is two good screwage spots you can pick of the choices available so be aware.  

It does stale quickly and the board of area control doesn’t add anything to the game what-so-ever, on the plus side there are barely any rules to explain.  It’s a filler with not many decisions or choices to make and it’s a decent one, just that it comes in a very big box for a filler and it is too long for a filler (about 40 mins, should be 20 - 30 max).  Also makes a good gateway game however.  

5 players could go slightly quicker due to board filling up faster, if I was ever to play again, I would eliminate some of the spots from the board from a few of the areas causing them to fill up faster and ending game quicker.  Or simply pick a number of rounds (like 12 rounds) and whoever is winning after 12 rounds wins(maybe better option).

I like this game a lot. I do not mind the blind bidding since it introduces this mind game of figuring out what your opponent needs and whether or not you can block them or if you want to gamble on spreading out on less likely targets.

I also like how quickly this game plays. A lot of choices but streamlined since a lot of options require little thought after winning and auctions are resolved in a fixed order.

Double guessing which roles the opponents will bid on combined with blind bidding on these roles, topped with some take that elements. The simultaneous bidding is interesting but gets repetitive soon. For the amount of chaos the game takes too long without introducing anything new. There is just not enough indication to make the guessing work with so many roles bid on at the same time. Bid high and lose or bid the minimum and win - both will happen. In the end, the game is decided by luck in the guessing coupled with best playing the take that game to sneak in your meeples into the high-scoring buildings.

I was pleasantly surprised by this game, which seems to polarize BGG users (based on their appreciation of blind bidding).  I like blind bidding, but Revolution! feels just a bit too repetitive without any kind of ramping up as the game progresses.  It can get very frustrating for some players if they keep getting canceled out, but I don't think that you're ever truly out of the game, which is a definite plus.

A blind auction game with the intent of area control.  It's fun to pull those screens back and see who outbid who or who didn't even bid on a certain space at all.  Players should be careful to make sure their actions yield them enough force/blackmail/gold for use in the next round, otherwise you start to feel powerless with just gold.  Late game antics where you swap cubes around can make for fun moments and can disrupt plans.  A good bit of strategy going on here.  Love the art on the board as well.

This is probably one of the most frustrating games you will ever play. However, it will probably make you want to play it again and again. Each time thinking this game will be better than the last. The blind bidding for actions and rewards is very cool as you try to figure out what your opponents are trying to do and how you can outbid them or win more actions with lower bids.

Revolution has grown to be my most popular game in the collection.  It has become this for a few reasons.  Firstly, my friends are light board game players, meaning that without me, they are playing Monopoly.  Thus making the easy to learn rules and simple goals very easy for them to digest.  My friends also for the most part enjoy less thinking and cerebral games.  That's not to say Revolution is dull and has no strategy in it.  Just that even for someone who does not think as hard they can still enjoy the game.

This is where the game really shines IMO.  The fun you get in Revolution is not in winning, but actually more in the journey to the end of the game.  Winning is just a bonus and everyone along the ride is enjoying themselves.  This is also made true by the nature of simultaneous planning of everyone's silent bids.  Very little down time, and any AP is done away by the nature of limiting choices you have to choose from.  So it keeps the game rolling, and no one is ever bored.

This is a game where a single play is never the end of its stay on the table.  It is always multiple plays and is the best gateway game for me to segue into deeper more involved games.

This is also the only game where a friend of mine liked it so much he not only bought his own copy, but he also bought the palace expansion.

If you're looking for a fast in between game that might end up taking your night up, a light game where you can play fully drunk, or sober, a game you can teach anyone of any age level, look no further.  This game is the easiest to break light board gamers into deeper games.

The only reason why this isn't a 10 / 10 is because I personally want to look for more.  Some will still feel the blind auction mechanic to take some thought process out and some luck at guessing is involved.  Meaning that despite the fact that you can really screw someone over, you didn't really plan it.  It all happened either due to your luck or theirs however you want to see it.  Sometimes you want to screw someone over and you totally miss it.  Screwing people over has definitely the biggest draw for most of my friends to play board games.  I just rather it was more controlled.

9/10 would suggest as a must have in your collection of games.

Despite comments to the contrary, this game has an extremely high luck component.  That does not necessarily make it a bad game, and truth be told I might be slightly blinded by the fact that I got hammered twice by a score of 210-70 or so in my first games.  Nonetheless, I do not like the game.  

To expand on my rant... yes, there is no "luck" in that there are no dice, or tile pulls, or cards drawn.  However, predicting the roughly random decisions made by all opponents, where a small error can result in glorious success turning into utter failure, is luck, but of a different form.

Very hard to predict but it plays quick enough that it doesn't really matter. The difference in scores between players can be HUGE!

A bit too repetative and 'lacking'... the mini expansion offered some nice options but with too many players it started dragging on and out stayed it's welcome.

Blackmail the printer. Threaten the innkeeper. Bribe the priest. Welcome to Revolution!

Secretly bid against your opponents to gain victory points, control territories (worth victory points at the end of the game) and collect more Gold, Blackmail, and Force tokens for the next round of bidding! Will you try to control the tavern or the fortress? The harbor or the plantation? Knowing where to push for points – and where to back away and let your opponents fight – is the key to victory. Whoever has the most victory points at the end of the game wins. It's a game of bluff, counter-bluff, and surprise!

I wasn't impressed at this game initially and it looks like a very casual mindless game. But I had great fun with it and was surprised with how well the whole bidding mechanics work. Players end up blocking each other and everyone will keep second guessing themselves in order to bid/bribe the correct spot. And in addition to that, it's a short game and easy to teach!

TKMaxx buy Oct 2013. Played my first game 3 player. I really enjoyed it and found it very interesting. A lot of second guessing and screwage, with big disappointments everytime you lift up those screens! I liked it, a solid game which works well with 3, maybe my new go to 3 player game. 4 player is a lot more busy with a lot more (accidental) screwage which can be quite frustrating for beginners (and veterans). Prefer 3.

While I will say that this game concludes quickly enough for "what it is", and further the guessing game does seem to have some valid tactics, it's still a guessing game that's better implemented first in Witch's Brew, and perhaps also in Castle for All Seasons.

Not worth buying, but an occasional play would be fine.

Update:

I began thinking more and more about this game and bought it. The thing is it's actually a fine game. It's got some interesting and at times exciting out guessing.

I don't typically like Steve Jackson games but I like this one.  You can bid using force, gold or blackmail as currencies.  You lose your bid whether you win or lose in a blind bid so there is a bluffing element.  It has a kind of rock paper scissors mechanic as well.  The game plays quick and is pretty fun. If you get a chance to play, I would recommend it.

Very fun game.  So glad I didn't trade it away before playing it.  This is staying in my collection.  Fun bidding, bluffing, auction style game with a cool little theme pasted on.  Easy to teach, easy to play, no turns, cool chits.  It's a winner.  

Regarding trades:  Only willing to trade for something very worthwhile.  Insert tossed.  Cubes bagged.  Game is in good condition.  Seen quite a few plays.  Expansion included.

A bit unsure about this one.  Seems to lack a "levelling" mechanism and scores can be all over the place, certainly not close at the end.

Pretty neat, simple auction/area control game, though the auctions are a bit too luck based for my taste. Specifically, losing what you bid when you don't win is very random - whether your low bids pan out or get tied or beaten is often a matter of blind guesswork rather than the result of a clever strategy.

Good game, has an expansion that works for 5-6. Strengths are that there are divergent strategies, there is a strong social component (in negotiating and figuring out what people are going to bid on), and the mechanics are simple. The main weakness is that this isn't a game you should play 20+ times, as the variation isn't endless by any means.

Right, it’s goofy and fun the 1st or 2nd time, but it’s really too random to take seriously. There’s really no theme and strategy is limited to guessing what other people are doing. Not my cup of tea, clearly.

Like this lighter euro a lot.  Great area control game with some blind auctions and trying to guess what your opponents are going to do.  Some will definitely NOT like the fact that some rounds you can be at a severe disadvantage, as well as the fact that it seems like a player could have run away with control over certain areas.  Experienced players will know how to combat this, but if there are new players at the table, it will seem downright unfair.
Very simple to teach, simple to play, could have some AP if your group is prone to that (especially with all the mind-games going on).  For me, though, very solid.

Played for the first time at RinCon '10. I was surprised at the clever layer of mechanics interacting here - there was a lot to keep track of - control on the board, what tokens opponents have each round, and the bluffing and second guess of the blind bid was just compelling. I did feel like things were a bit fiddly - there was a ton of upkeep and token management, but in the end I still had a great time. I wouldn't mind picking a copy of this up, and I think it would probably improve with future plays.

I think one play is enough for me to know I don't need to play this one again.  The components are nice but the game seems to lack any strategy whatsoever.  I actually like some blind bidding games (e.g. Aladdin's Dragons) where you can make educated guesses as to what the other players might do, but here it is a complete crapshoot.

Revolution! is a pretty simple game that is easy to teach & learn and fun to play.  It reminded me of Citadels a little due to bluffing, opponent screwage, and trying to figure out your opponent's next move, but Revolution! feels more random.  With the right group, beer, and trash talk, Revolution! is a good break-out-and-play game.  Update: moved my rating up after another play.

RATING: 7
I'm really surprised at how much I enjoyed this game. The blind bidding works remarkably well, and although the game is very simple, there is a lot of guess work and double-think that goes on. I've only played with the "friendly" rules where bids are returned, but I think it would work fine either way. My only real concern at this point is the replay value. There just doesn't seem to be a lot of variation from game to game. If there were different modules or something, that would make this game a definite keeper. I'll have to look into expansions to see if there's anything that will help Revolution reach that point.

Revolution! combines 2 of my most disliked game mechanics: Area Control and Auction/Bidding. I suck at both, so Revolution! had absolutely no hope of appealing to me. The only innovation in Revolution! is the 3 forms of currency used to bid which, for me, only confuses my already limited ability at bidding.

RATING: 6
Really, really wanted to like this game after learning the rules, and enjoyed it for the first few turns ... then a player got in a lucky turn where they ended up with 5 force/blackmail tokens + coins, and the rest of the players only had coins. This broke the game. That player simply covered the spaces that continually earned back the same tokens (especially the top row of the board) while dominating the influence board, and the other players (especially me!) were just stuck with 5 coins for the rest of the game. There were multiple turns where I simply earned nothing at all, no matter what I chose. I was reduced to placing coins randomly and quietly waiting for the game to end.

Ok, played it a second time and it went well. One other player felt as above for several turns, but his luck turned around. This was a 3-player game instead of 4, so maybe 4 is too chaotic.

Played with 4 again .... and again it was terrible. One player ran off with a massive lead (twice the score of other players), and other players ended up just plain bitter, praying the game would end. Even the winning player was feeling bad and wanted to end the game ... that's not a good sign for a game. Once you have two force and two blackmail, why wouldn't you just lock down the top row of the board for the rest of the game, in an endless loop? The other three players are left fighting _each other_ for the remaining spaces, which makes things even worse for them.

RATING: 6
What I like:
- The theme actually works really well
- There was no negotiation or backstabbing in our game
- Simple mechanics, and at 35 minutes it was pleasantly quick
- Nice components

What I don't like:
- Blind bidding and area majority mechanics
- It's all about out-guessing and double-thinking your opponents. I tend to just play fairly randomly, and treat it as a chaotic extremely light game. If you try to really analyze it, you can bog down in severe AP.

I went into this game expecting to really hate it. I was very surprised that despite using mechanics I tend to strongly dislike (blind bidding, out-guessing, area majority), it was actually kind of fun. 

If it had gone 90 minutes, or even 60, it would have felt too long. None of us were AP-prone, so the game flew by in 35. I wouldn't ask to play, but also wouldn't dread playing again.

I think the weight is probably a bit lower than the BGG-voted 2.1. I'm sure some people see a lot of depth in the blind bidding, but I don't see it as depth.

RATING: 6
This is a blind-bidding role selection game--each turn you split your resources among various roles that you want to take, and if you allot the most, you can take that action.  Losers lose their bids, but it doesn't sting quite as much because you can't save resources from turn to turn anyway.  Actions involve placing area control cubes, gathering more resources for next turn, or getting victory points.  There are three different levels of resources, each of which is worth more than any amount of a lesser resource, but some roles cannot be bought with a given resource type.  The game is both different and clever, but the blind bidding limits its strategic depth and can occasionally cause frustration.

RATING: 9
An excellent strategic bluffing game that will really challenge your ability to understand and predict your opponents every move. Playing on probabilities will help in your role bidding, but it'll only take you so far. 

The game mechanics are very simple and you'll pick it up in a single turn, but the depth will come from the silent interactions with the other players.

The production value is good. The artwork is average, the 'revolution' theme works OK, and the durability of the board and pieces is appropriate for the type of game. I think a little artwork on the bidding boards would have been nice, but the game board is painted. 

I highly recommend this game. It's so easy to introduce to new players and get a session completed in an hour. There isn't any monotonous resource management, calculations, etc...just take the few resources you have each turn and make the most strategic play you can.

This is the favorite game of all my non-gamer friends. A game is usually under an hour, the auction mechanic is simple and fun: everyone places their bids secretly and collectively reveals them. If you played it right, your bids will block others, give you resources and give you a strategic edge on the board (politically owning buildings in the city) and on the next turn. To get what you want, you have to balance bribes, blackmail and force to get the necessary influence to win the revolution. The theme is just right and without a flaw.

RATING: 8.5
Cool game. You should try and get an "engine" going soon, that will keep you with a lot of tokens. My son managed to pull this off and for most of the game he had 10+ stuff to use. Only issue with the game appears to be that you can end up trailing if you get hammered a few turns in a row, but it is still a lot of fun to play.

There is simply something wrong with this game. I have yet to play a game that did not have a run-away leader. Using a variant suggested by Fadutti, one player not only lapped all of the others, he scored more than 3 times as many points as the last place player. 

We all agree that the game seems to have great potential but just breaks down while playing.

A game with a lot of chaos, Requires a good bit of second guessing your opponent. So it contains a nice combination of bluff and guess work. In the game you commit your resources to gain roles. While you want to win with minimal commitment, you definitely do not want to commit to a zone and lose.

The game definitely has phases - early on you have to be flexible and win roles, from there focus on your position development and pay to win what you need. 

The game plays much better with 4 where each round the leaders fight for the first row the trailers fight for the bottom row. With 3 I've seen too many runaways - if two conflict early the 3rd gets too strong of a position.

Playing this was a nightmare. You place 3 separate and unique forms of currency on a spot on your player board behind a screen (like a worker placement game). Everyone simultaneously reveals their personal player boards and people get the benefit of a position if they won it but if it was a tie or a loss the currency is gone and no benefit is given for that position. It is not uncommon to essentially lose your entire turn due to having ties or loses in every position. 

It sucked. It felt like a big random mess with a semi hidden lose your turn mechanic. Totally lame.

This is an easy to learn, fun outbid/outwit your opponent game.  However, sometimes it can feel a little random or lucky with bidding.  There are some large swings at the end of the game which can inflate the winners lead but the game seems to play close throughout.  Great components and quality for the price.  Occasionally there can be a run away problem with this game because there is no catchup mechanism but I would say to that...just don't fall behind.

Very-low : I'm very unlikely to trade this, most likely only if it gets me one of my most sought after games.

This remains my biggest disappointment of all the games I've bought. 
Where is the revolution? Where is the intrigue, the barricades, the bold revolutionaries, the Junta, the nasty King?  nowhere. None of theses feature in this lifeless blind bidding area control game.

Great blind bidding game, using three different resources which in turn collect more resources or help you vie for control of high-valued areas of the board. Lots of second-guessing the other bidders, and scrambling for bidding advantage. I really enjoy it, but then I like bluffing games. If you don't like blind auctions, stay away.

It is a fine game for what it does.  Lots of luck and take that and not enough strategy but does what it does well.

Lowered my rating, wanted to like it but it just doesn't do it for me, can't take the blind biding.

In general, I don't like blind bidding. But, it actually works in this game. So far I've only played with the 'losing the bid' mechanic w/ three players, which I assumed I wouldn't like, but it turned out to work very well. It's more thematic that way anyway. How do you get a refund on Force, anyway? I guess it could just all be threats...  but, yeah, this is a fun game.

RATING: 6
Like A Game of Thrones without the board-play. Simultaneously bid on up to 5-6 different actions from a menu of 12, and whoever bids the highest on each action gets to carry it out. Actions are merely some combination of gaining VPs, getting cubes into majority arenas, and getting resources. Nice balancing act, and trying to account for what people want, but it's dry.

RATING: 7
Blind bidding in the style of this game is usually not my thing.  I played my first game with 6p, which can lead to a lengthy game for what this is due to so many "pushes" in the bidding.  It's not bad.  I've certainly played worse.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played it again after a while. 

It's good for once in a while, in particular if I want my GF to win (me, and most of men just suck so so badly at this one). It's a game of blind bidding and predicting what people will do and unlike some role selection games where one can deduct what people will do, here it's more open which demands better reading of players. And my GF is good at this and I'm stumbling in a dark. But she wins and that's what I bought the game for, so yay!

The problem with the game is that it has a runaway leader, which seems less apparent if you play with money back variant (though it is said this is more an appearance, but even that's making it a nicer experience). The second problem is that everything I like about this one Turn the Tide does it simpler and better. But all in all it's a game I'll rarely pull out, but I'll enjoy it nonetheless.

Played at 2012 Spring Gaming Hoopla. This one... I dono.. the bidding felt like a slightly more advanced version of paper-rock-scissors which kind of bugged me, and it started getting old. Plus the game dragged near the end when it got to the point where the only influences worth getting were being dominated by players with better bidding chips so it became pointless for anybody else to try and advance.

My least favourite area majority game. (Most of the games I played in this genre turned out to be quite good!)

The blind bidding means the player who's in the lead probably got there through luck. And then this game makes it almost impossible to catch the leader. (BTW, in my one play of this game, [b][i]I[/i][/b] was this leader.)

Nice and cutthroat. You are well rewarded for correctly guessing other people's intentions. I played this with 5 players, and I suspect I would enjoy it more with less players cause it would make the guessing-what-people-do puzzle and the resulting mind games easier to digest (and thus more practical)

This was a big surprise to me as I expect anything from Steve Jackson Games to suck. And I'm skeptical of blind bidding. But the way the various resources refill and interact, and the large number of turns, works well. You get a chance to WIN lots of PRIZES, which is fun even if you don't pull through in the end.

Nice simple mechanic and with everyone going simultaneously it doesn't drag. Feels like it should be a good party game, but is very limited in choice of player numbers (3-4). I would suspect that the addition of 'The Palace' expansion extending this to up to six players should make this much more playable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Surprisingly good, especially since it's a Steve Jackson game. Blind bidding is the central mechanic, and so you're really trying to outwit your opponents to obtain points and influence. I really like how you use what you earn in one round for the next, and a very poor round can hurt you in the next one, while a good round sets up the next one nicely (although there is excellent balance in that you can't really hold an advantage for too long). Gameplay is simple and pretty fast, making it have wide appeal.

Ugh.  Played with 6 players, turns are a crap-shoot.  There were several turns when I did not win any actions.  And influence in a building is not guaranteed if the building has been finished, as subsequent spies, etc., can take away what you've worked hard to achieve.  This is a very annoying game.

Felt really flat with my group.  You know what tokens everybody has so the bluffing is limited.  So is the surprise when the boards are revealed.
It felt too long for what it is.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Figuring out whom to influence is just too random.  You'd think you could predict what another player will do based on past actions or standing on the board, but you really can't.  Any lead you have in any part of the board can disappear in a single round, so almost all of the strategy is in the endgame.

Pretty little game with nice components.  Has a problem with "runaway leader" syndrome and pretty much depends on key plays at the end...  but can be the perfect game for gamers who love cutthroat plays and potential "WOAH!" moments.

Excelent Steve Jackson Game, usually that might be a oxymoron, but not here, simple rules, euro style scoring, blind bidding, plays up to 6 with the expansion which is a must.  Plays 4-5 best, 6 is highly contested and suffers from the crowding syndrome seen in 4 player or 6 player Catan.

RATING: 6.5
Easily the best game that SJG has ever put out.  This one feels like 12 blind-bid auctions happening at one time except table-talk is encouraged to create some bargains/backstabbing.  The 3 different currencies work perfectly.

I do feel that the game is a bit too easy.  I don't like how you always have 5 pieces of currency to use.  I'm thinking that this one will be much better with the 5-6 player expansion as that will really crowd things up a bit and make you work harder to get what you want.

This game is almost pure chaos in trying to decide what to do each round.  So much is inherent upon what others do, and the fact that if you lose, you lose your bid and get nothing turns this game into a game of complete randomness even though there are no random elements.

You have some control over the area majorities, but it breaks down toward the game end, as people will begin using the switch cube actions rather than the place cube actions.

It looks simple. It seems simple. The theme...kinda pasted on.  However after playing once against Tiff and Chey and than a second time against Tiff, Chey and Tiff's Dad - it's true that there is a LOT more game going on here than what it seems.  For a Steve Jackson Game I'm impressed.  I like that we can try to second guess each other - or worse - sometimes take a hasty bet and get everything we want because you've got others fighting for influence on something else.  I have a feeling this may be a staple down the road.

I enjoyed my one game, but the game does seem to have a few issues. One is that if you get behind for a few rounds you can be almost eliminated from the game. One player had at least two or three rounds in a row where they didn't get anything at all after the bidding phase, so they were at a pretty big disadvantage and the game doesn't really have anything built in to deal with that situation.

Also it seemed like certain actions were way better than others, so a number of the decisions were obvious.

With those issues aside, it was fun enough and I would play it again. The blind bidding with three level of resources was interesting, and the game seemed to be the perfect length.

I would've liked it a lot more had I not played better games of its type.

The main blind bidding mechanic in this game works really well.  Deciding which character to bid on (not only that but how much to bid) makes for interesting decisions and multiple strategies throughout the game.  It is simple enough to work as a gateway game, and everyone I've played it with has enjoyed it.  I do wish it worked with more players because I don't get the chance to play it very often.

Played this game as part of a six game tournament. Revolution! is quick to learn, easy to teach, and fast to play. There's multiple paths to victory and even when you think you have no chance of winning, you can come back and win. With that said, Revolution! also has some glaring problems... Skilled players can drag the game out if they feel they aren't winning and often the last cube swap of a game can cause a near 100 point swing. Still, I had a fun time with this game and I'd be willing to give it quite a few more gos.

In Revolution! players take advantage of the fluid political situation by secretly bidding for a number of characters, each yielding a combination of territory control, points (popular support) and more currency with which to bid next round. Players win by gaining the support of the people (the most points). Players can gain bonus points by controlling an area of the city at the end of the game. This game is for 3-4 players and takes 60 minutes to play.

The game relies far too much on luck. Some people claim there's a tremendous amount of strategy in trying to deduce where other people might play. But in a four player game, the first few rounds are basically a crapshoot and you can quickly fall behind and be stuck bidding 5 gold each round while your opponents have 3 force, 2 blackmail and 3 gold. But by then, it's clear what you have to go for and your opponents can block you out and you have no good shot at any on which a blackmail or force can be played. Just not a fan at all.

Played with the right goup of people this is tons of fun!
It is suitable for both experienced and unexperienced players. 
But, as mentioned before, you need a fun group of people to play this with.
If you have one, I highly recommend this game! Plus: the design is great.

Another one of those games than can be taught in minutes, yet seems to appeal to a wide variety of gamers.  I've never taught this game to someone and had them refuse a second (third, fourth, fifth...) play.  The blind bidding can get very tense, even among casual gamers.

Gang,

I played this game for the first time last weekend with Tom Vasel here in Uijeongbu, ROK, and REALLY enjoyed it.  The rules are simple and easy to learn, the game play is relatively light, and the bidding and decision-making are a blast!  The game can be played fairly quickly; no more than an hour once you learn the rules, and is perfect for both hardcore gamers and more recreational gamers.  The components are also high quality.  The board is attractively drawn, and the cards concealing the bids are sturdy and brightly colored.  This is probably the best Steve Jackson game that I can ever remember playing.  Buy at once!

Played with 6 and didn't care too much for it. Half way through the game I started randomly placing my pieces instead of strategizing and actually did better - when random is just as good as strategy, there isn't much game there.

Here you have proof that [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/19/steve-jackson-games]Steve Jackson Games[/url] can produce something that doesn't suck.  I wasn't expecting too much from the publisher that seems mostly interested in putting out terrible overpriced card games like [gameid=1927] and [gameid=28] year after year, so I was surprised.  There's actually a game here.  It's very abstract, which is somewhat of a surprise.  Players are revolutionaries, and blind bid with three different currencies on different townsfolk, which allow them to place influence around the board.  Yep, sounds like every euro ever.  But this one works, in spite of abstractions.  The interaction between ranked currencies and the inability to bribe certain townsfolk with the stronger currencies means that placing your bids is always an interesting decision, and different every round.  Furthermore, you have to balance grabbing things this round with deciding to set yourself up for next round.  A good game that serious boardgamers should really look at, so long as they don't mind blind bidding.  It's very quick, and the doublethink is delicious.

Наконец-то Джексон выдал что-то стоящее после горы манчкиновского мусора и бургеровского фастфуда. И по компонентам, и по геймплею игра хороша. Сыграли две партии вчетвером. Есть желание играть еще. Осн. минус игры, который не дает ей подняться еще выше, - ситуации, когда отстающий игрок в конце игры может просто выбрать себе объект подгаживания (некий kingmaking). И противостоять этому не всегда получается.

Great.  The tension in the game is superb, at first we thought that if if play right you get a run away leader.  That's not the case, if you have a bad round you've just gotta be smart and not so greedy the next turn until you have the firepower you need.  Really enjoy this game

Η επανάσταση γίνεται με δωροδοκία, εκβιασμό κ ξύλο. Έτσι κ εσείς με secret bidding προσπαθείτε σε κάθε γύρο να πάρετε με το μέρος σας τα κυριότερα μέλη της πόλης για να ξεσηκώσετε την επανάσταση και να ασκήσετε την μεγαλύτερη επιρροή στην πόλη. Το ίδιο θέλουν κ οι αντίπαλοι σας, οπότε η κόντρα θα είναι μεγάλη!

In Revolution! players take advantage of the fluid political situation by secretly bidding for a number of characters, each yielding a combination of territory control, points (popular support) and more currency with which to bid next round. Players win by gaining the support of the people (the most points). Players can gain bonus points by controlling an area of the city at the end of the game. This game is for 3-4 players and takes 60 minutes to play.

Note: Revolution! - The Palace is stored with the base game. It allows you to play with a 5th and 6th player

I just can't get into this one. It might be that the base mechanism that drives the game is too simple and repetitive for my tastes. Or it might just be one of those games that needs to be played in the right group to really sing. I'll try it once or twice more with a few different people to see if my experience improves...

Simpatico gioco di maggioranze e bluff, dov'è proprio la parte di bluff a farla da padrona. Alcune azioni sono molto interessanti perchè spingono ad una interazione più aggressiva, forse nè avrei messa qualcuna in più. per il resto il gioco necessita di una buona preparazione e sopratutto la necessita di non concedere troppo agli avversari.

Awesome bidding game that's not too long to play.  The mechanics allow for comebacks, which keeps it exciting.  Simple, but well thought out and makes you want to keep playing (b/c you really should have won that last one, but somehow that certain scoundrel beat you out at the last moment).

A rough blind bidding game.  I've only played it once but I struggled with trying to get the favors I needed it seemed like every turn I was getting beaten out by someone else.  It also doesn't help that you lose the money you put up for the bidding.  I want to try it again to see how I feel about it.

Gotten two plays. The idea is good, and it's not a bad game per se, but it's too much down-time between auctions. There are better games that fullfil the same urge.

Area control blind-auction game with great interaction of player choices. Players must use all resources every turn, and the choices they make give them the opportunity to improve their resource pool for the next round.

The components are printed on excellent quality materials. It is a shame that, with an exception of the tokens/counters, the graphics are very weak.

RATING: 5
First off, unlike most Steve Jackson games, there is a real game here, with good components, a competent design, and no stupid jokes.

However, it's just not my kind of game.  It is a game about trying to blindly outguess your opponents.  Kind of like Rock, Paper, Scissors on steroids.  There are a few things to guide you to making decisions, so it isn't entirely random, but it is pretty random.

Also, this randomness means that sometimes the rich just get richer.  If you have a good turn, and end up with more bidding power for the next turn, you are likely to have another good turn (and therefore more bidding power for the next turn).

I enjoy this one, but I am one of the better players in my group.  Sometimes it seems that players can get frustrated.  Turn after turn of not getting anything you bid on is not fun.  If all of your players are poker players or gamblers, I'd say you'd be fine.

RATING: 8.8
Played for the first time with three other non-gamers, and after an enjoyable first game with mistakes we went straight into a second game. Simple to explain and understand and fun. Highly recommended. Have yet to try the Palace expansion which I own.

Update: Played five player with the Palace expansion, the fifth player being new to the game. Worked as well as the the four player version. Can get a bit "mathy": you could - and probably should - stop and add up scores to see how you're doing, but I tend not to (to avoid AP).

Update 2: Another 2 games with 5 with Palace expansion, and it bumps the score up (from 7.9). No downtime really makes this game, and it feels like it plays quickly.

Unique perspective of what happens to people that are caught up in a revolution. Reveal moves on your action board from behind player screens using blackmail, force and gold. Bluff and second guess the other players. Maddening part is hosing or getting hosed by each other's revealed and resolved actions. Fill the board and determine the winner.

A decent blind-bidding game that has players vying for control of certain markets and locations on the board. The rock-paper-scissors breakdown of tokens was unique. Easy to find yourself in a hole with resources if your play gets blocked, though.

hidden gem this one - recommend to any looking for a blind auction game. Very fast, bold iconography, quite light once initial rules bump passed.

Blind bidding round after round gets a little old. I like the way the game plays but wish it were a few rounds shorter. I think I am going suggest randomly placing 2 cubes of each color to the board at the start. This would also make the bottom center offices useful on the first round.

Fun, simple bidding/area control game. What makes this game shine is the Bidding. I have the Anarchy expansion and I think it's a must have. It has spots to give other players negative points, a mechanic sorely lacking in the base game. That aside, the way the bidding works is great. One force is worth more than any Blackmail or Gold. One Black mail is worth more than any Gold. You can only bid on six total things and they all give you: spots on the board, more resources. Not much theme, but the bidding in this game is my favorite implementation of bidding in any game.

Picked up for a bargain price at TK Maxx of all places, and a good little game it is too - one of the best to come from Steve Jackson in fact. Blind bidding against each other really adds an element of second guessing and internal arguing - which then becomes a whole raft of 'I can't believe you did that' once bids are revealed :) Simple yet effective.

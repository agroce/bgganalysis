One of the best entries in the 15 and counting series.  Mostly because of what it gives you in the box.  3 separate games.  A quick 1st Bull Run that plays in a few hours and the larger and more comprehensive battles of 2nd Bull Run and a Hypo third battle.  All decent games in their own right.  I like the full blown 7 Days game the most, and Barren Victory the second most...this is the 3rd best.  This is also the one in the series that I would recommend getting first if you want to try the system out.

CWBS are the best ACW games out there. If you are an ACW buff you have to own them all.
Played this once. Enjoyed it very much.

I'm a big fan of the CWB system. It really evokes the flavour of the ACW to me.

This is a good package. The first battle is small, the second bigger (but rather predictable if you force the Union to use the historical orders as their troops arrive and attack piecemeal). The third is hypothetical, but looks to be very interesting. One of the best CWB games, IMO.

I really like this game, but it looks like it's only going to be played via online play for the near future.  I don't have a local gaming partner willing to play this one.  I keep feeling like this game is a boardgame version of a miniatures game - the orders and the effort with which they are executed provide no little amount of leeway and somewhat of a grey area.  Still, one of the more fun ACW battle-level games I have played.

Based on my experiences with this title, I preordered Dean Essig's new line of ACW battle games, Line of Battle from MMP.

11/13/11 Update - As the months have wiled by, I have fallen more and more in love with the series - both the CWBS and the RSS.  I'm still waiting to get an opponent for the new system, Line of Battle.  The rules for CWBS have plenty of holes in them, especially when you add in the scenario special rules to the mix.  But the effort and problems are well worth it.

Probably the best package in the series. 3 battles, one good for learning the game. One good as an interesting what-if. One big battle with lots of options that can become a massive Gettysburg sized battle if all the optional units are thrown in. Top product, top series, really interesting battles.

I've only played part of "The Second Day" (I think), but it really looks like the designer accomplished his goals with this game.  Unfortunately, straight battle games without cards haven't really caught my fancy completely yet.  I do like the scale and the command system.  Plus the handful of dice thing is cool.  Quite novel from what I've seen so far.  I could see enjoying this a lot more with practice, but there are just too many other great games to play.

My introduction to "real" wargames.  I have very little knowledge of this part of history.  Nevertheless, I enjoyed this game once I got the feel for the rules and the scenario.  I like the way the Orders work, and especially how the units become weakened after taking hits.  The uniqueness of each unit is nice as well (Jackson is one tough cookie!).  Now that I'm past the learning curve, I'd be open to playing this more.

I enjoy the Civil War Brigade Series in general, but Three Battles of Manassas is a particularly good game in the series.  The components are top-rate, there's lots of usable maneuver room, and the fact that there are three separate scenario books (for 1861, 1862 and 1863) yields a lot of variety, not only in the situations, but also in the quality of the troops and the organization of the armies.  This is effectively three games in one.

I played both First Manassas and Second Manassas Campaign Scenarios. Excellent game.

RATING: 8
The 'Clash of Volunteers' command rules for the CSA (you have to order each brigade separately) are nice for historical education but a terrible way to fight.  I'm not sure I'd recommend this scenario as an entry point for the series because of that.  I think it's easier to learn the system the normal way with something like No Better Place to Die.  

I've not played Second Manassas yet but this is one of my favorite game systems ever.  Love the orders system!

I like the interesting terrain in Manassas.

RATING: 6
The package is excellent. The "fantasy scenario" is nice. The system is brilliant. However, the fun factor is pretty low compared to the time it takes to play. Maybe I haven't got into it yet. Looking to give it a second chance. But it might take a while, since I'm not a civil war buff.

1st and 2nd Bull Run, and a "what if ?" 3rd Bull Run. Excellent components, clear, functional map. Command rules require a modicum of effort to absorb, but reward that effort by making the game even more exciting. My first CWB game, but it won't be my last.

Yawn ... it was an ok game experience ... 

There is alot of orders writing which I am not fond of.  There is alot of die rolling which I'm ok with ... there is alot of recording of damage which I am not fond of.

I keep this game because it's probably the best medium size Bull Run game out there ...

One of the best values in wargaming.  You get three separate battles, each of which has multiple scenarios, each of which can be played according to multiple strategies.

RATING: 6
The three battles in this game allow you to see how the Union and CSA armies evolved from 1861 to 1863.  Second Bull Run plays especially well with the command system.  Union corps are slow to accept orders and execute them while the better CSA leaders can change plans and outmaneuver them.  Update 10/06:  First Bull Run plays well in this game too.  The system really captures the difficulty in getting those big brigades to go where you want them to in a cooridinated attack.  And the difference in morale is really apparent in First Bull Run as Jackson's Bridgade really does stand like a stone wall.

Surprisingly this game got a strong show in the top 10 wargames.  I like the battles of Manassas as they are the first I encountered with American Civil War at operational level (the Great Campaigns of American Civil War series).  So I have a special interest in these 3 battles.  But I am not particularly keen about the written order system.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
An excellent tactical wargame of the first and second battles of Bull Run, along with a hypothetical third battle. The command rules make the game come alive and provide the greatest source of consternation in the game. Another quality game from The Gamers. Heartily recommended to any ACW wargame enthusiast, but may not fit well with beginners or light wargame aficionado's.

I haven't played anything but the smallest scenario, but physically and in terms of historical research this game is very impressive.  If you like CWB you have to have this game...plus you get 3 battles of Manassas, 2 historical and 1 "what-if".  Nice job by the designer and publisher here.

The Civil War Brigade Series is also a favorite. CWB with its combination of orders, limited activation, morale as well as fire effects provides a good simulation of the chaos of the Civil War Battlefield.

First Battle of Manassas is an excellent entry to the system - limited counters lots of room to maneuver. Second Manassas is not balanced unless you use both maps and allow for activity on Pope's left. It actually makes a decent 3 player one for the Union and Confederates split between Jackson and Longstreet.

Having now had the opportunity to play TBoM several times, I find the CWB system to be a fascinating model of this level of ACW combat.  The command system in particular adds a degree of psychological realism that I have seldom seen in wargaming.  One of the major "pluses" of TBoM (and probably of the Seven Days' Battles volumes as well, judging from the maps) is the amount of maneuver room you have relative to counter density, allowing the player to attempt to take a different approach (if my subordinates would only get moving . . . ;-)   Great system overall! Just starting "April's Harvest"--a very different situation, to be sure--and looking forward to trying other entries in the series as well.

Possibly the best entry in the series so far. The 3 battles really show the various armies at alternate times in the war, with various tactical and command problems to be solved at each juncture. The graphics are top-notch and there are lots of smaller scenarios for those short on time.

Read the rules, starting to play solo. Great looking maps and nice counters. The rules are very good - with interesting orders. There is no full example of play and charts and numbers are a bit hard to find at times.... I'll say more when I actually play.

1st game - wow! the order rules are excellent and create a real feel of actually commanding troops and cajoling them to do what you want. Very frustrating but great fun. Excellent morale and melee rules.

Played quite a few times now f2f and VASSAL. Great game and recreates the tension perfectly. The order and combat / damage systems aren't very hard and add a lot of depth. Definitely a keeper! :)

Though this battle is strongly affected by Pope's stubborn command, this series is the best to study this situation.

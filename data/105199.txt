Thematically the game is about sending players on a mission to explore and colonise planets and gather resources. Sound great for any sci-fi fan but the mechanics do not do much to support immersion which is only achieved through visual presentation and through the primitive excitement of exploring planets and seeing what resources there might be. 

To fly to a certain planet you need the corresponding card to do so (card with planet’s number printed on it). To explore a planet you need a card allowing that particular planet to be explored (card with planet’s explore number printed on it). To colonise a planet you need two cards matching the planet to do so (two cards with planet’s colonisation numbers printed on it). As a gaming experience this translates to an optimisation problem. In which order to play cards in order to minimise actions wasted on discarding useless cards and drawing replacements. But not even the best optimised play guarantees win since luck of draw dictates the actions available to you, and victory points are granted from collecting sets of similar resources, the location of which is unknown until you explore the planets. So you just do what you can with the cards given and hope to find the resources that match the sets you have chosen to collect.

This is not to say that there is not any challenge nor decisions in the game but your doings feel quite detached from the theme. Moreover, be warned that the game is quick, very quick actually. You only have time to visit half of the planets at maximum and this cuts the fun of exploration short. 

Nothing is broken or anything. However, the fun factor is not too high and I, being a sci-fi fan and thus unforgiving towards bad implementations of the theme, would have wanted to see more.

Simple set collection game with a cool Sci-Fi theme and a minor memory aspect. There is some luck in the card drawing part of the game. The game is uninspiring and gets repetitive quickly.

RATING: 4.8
I am willing to admit that I might be missing something, but this game strikes me as being too reliant on luck.  You need the right cards, or else you seem to have no chance against a decent player.  I feel like I've already lost when I can't jump to, scan and develop a planet with the initial cards in hand.  Having to "Top Up" when you've got a full hand (but no decent combination of cards) is a wasted action and means you are falling behind through no fault of your own.  That's not good.

Can't quite decide how I feel about this game.  It's very Knizia-like - I just can't decide if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  Pretty abstract, the strategy "seems" obvious, but I find myself wanting to play it more, and I think it might have some hidden depth.

One of the biggest stinkers I played in recent history. After reading the rules I though it might be interesting. Given the fact it has a space theme I decided to try it out. But boy, was I disappointed! Gameplay is so uneventful and bland that it hurts after minutes. Everything seems pointless and random and boring. Stay away!

First play of the game left with mixed feelings. Components are cool and game has things going for it but it all ended so suddenly. I sense that scoring could be the biggest issue with this game since there's not that many tiles you definitely are going to get and creating good combos out of them is hard.

RATING: 5
Simple set collection game with quite a bit of luck in both the card draws and the tile distribution. I think the tile distribution is the main issue here because you're not going to explore enough planets during the course of the game for initial good or bad draws to even out. This effect is further reinforced by the free resource grabs after a planet has been settled. It's still a reasonable effort for such a short game but nevertheless smells a little of wasted potential.

This game looks great and the space theme is very appealing to boys.
However it's not a gamers game. It light and a simple set collection game. The rules as they are, are very family friendly. So not being the target group for this game, I say it's an ok filler from time to time but not someting I'll suggest. It would be cool if the rules were something like "basic" and additionally there were advanced rules for a gamier game, but nope, just a filler for adults or a good boys game.

Playing this a lot on Yucata lately, and sometime with the real thing.

I can't see a winning strategy yet, and I believe this is an awfully random game. But on Yucata it is light fun, so I play it for what it is. Still though I don't seem to be able to win as much as I'd like... :(

RATING: 7
Fine family game where you collect several types of sets. There is quite a bit of luck in card draws and tile distribution, no deep strategies, and the rule that allows taking stuff for free after a planet is developed bugs me. Also, the generally abrupt end is often frustrating. Nonetheless, the game is good fun for what it is. Of course, it helps that I love a space theme (although it is thin here) and the art is excellent. The art was, indeed, a huge factor in my decision to buy the game, in special the cover that shamelessly drives a lot of inspiration from the TV series "Stargate: Atlantis", complete with stargate and puddle jumper. But as a fan of both "SG-1" and "Atlantis", and having not seen any good games officially based on either, I'm not complaining. In fact, I must confess I'm probably being a little generous in my rating because of that.

RATING: 6.5
A good filler game with neat ideas, but as most of this kind, there's a good amount of luck involved. The concept is fine and it's fun, but I would like it much more if you had more control / less luck in this game.

Will try it with a few twists like drawing from open cards, instead of the deck.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (March 2012)

I was drawn to this game because Space theme is my favorite theme in boardgames, movies and books. I was a bit disappointed with the game. It is an ok light/familiar game.

The game looks nice but it has a lot of uncontrollable luck (when you do a Top Up action, when you scan a planet, when you fly to a planet). The winner is decided solely by luck. I had some fun playing it, but I think I will pass more plays of this (unless it is on Yucata).

Current Rating: 5.0

RULES OVERVIEW
-----------------------
This is a set collection and almost hand management game. The set collection involves going to planets and looking at the stack of tiles there, then claiming tiles. I'm not going to go into too much detail. Tiles score in different ways, some are worth a straight 3VP, most get better the more of a like-kind you collect. In order to move, and claim tiles you must spend cards. You have a hand of 5 cards each card has two of three symbols and each symbol also has an integer from 1 to 4. Each planet has listed numbers for moving to it, exploring it or scanning it (these two are essentially ways to get tiles). 

On a turn you have two actions. You want to visit lots of planets to put together nice sets of tiles, but if you do that you will take less 'acquire-tile' actions and while your VP per tile will be higher you will have less tiles. That is the basic balancing philosophy of the game. Of course it only works on average since bad tile synergy between the planets you visit can mean the slow path does not pay out more VP. Not to mention other player's decisions of what to collect.


THOUGHTS
--------------
There are two main complaints I have with this game. First is the amount of luck in which tiles exist at the planets you randomly decide to visit. It takes a lot of resources to travel to a planet and collect some tiles, if your planet is better than mine then you win! This could even out during play but the game simply isn't long enough for this to happen regularly. 

Second, and perhaps worse, is the luck from drawing cards. You often need 4 cards to travel, scan, and develop a planet. That means 4 of your 5 cards need to be match a planet's values. In the early game that's fine since all the planets are unexplored but as the game progresses you need very specific cards. It takes you an action to discard/draw so if you're unlucky then you have to dump actions into card draw and you loose!

It is an interesting game in some respects and perhaps with some variants to reduce the luck it could be more fun. As it is the game can be very frustrating. You can try to adapt to bad draws but that's not always possible, and the ability to do that lends itself to certain tile collection strategies. So if you want to do that you're destroying some of the fun of the set collection decision space.

Space Mission is a solid, if fairly unremarkable, card/board game. It's certainly enjoyable, but nothing I'd ever own.
Aside: both the cover/game art and the promotional video graphics are lifted almost exactly from Stargate: Atlantis. The remaining art is good and the component quality is excellent.

Space Mission is one of the few games that are too short: the game ends before it really gets going. Its still a solid effort so I hope the designer reworks his ideas into a longer (and slightly more complex) game.

I hope artists who work on board games take a look at Space Mission: components don't get more functional than this.

The idea is great and the game is almost good. Unfortunately there is one action which is too easy to do and without cards which actually ruins the whole game. Some more tweaking and this would be good.

Not much here but it seems there should be. Run from planet to planet and grab stuff to get you points. All you have to do is mark it and maybe spend an action to develop the planet to get them but that's really all there is to it. You don't have to take anything anywhere just pick it up.

Quirky little space-based set collecting game. Overproduced for what it is and with oddly complex scoring, but still a nice semi-filler about developing worlds and buggering about in a space-bus.

RATING: 5
Uneventful set collection, with great looking components. Using cards to move around, explore and collect sets sounds promising, but the game severely lacks something. It's all in the box it needs to become a good game, it only screams for a little more excitement. More player interaction/conflict/area control, some real purpose for the scan action, or anything to make it more meaty.

Players travel or jump to planets, explore and develop them to earn various goods that score in different ways usually depending on how many of the set you own. I think with skilled players it's always going to come down to who has the perfect card draws and who landed on the most fruitful planet. So it's probably best suited as a light family game. 

You can scan planets to claim tiles but you only get those tiles once the planet is developed. The problem is that once a planet is developed you no longer need to play cards on your turn to grab items.  This incentives players to just stay on the planet rather than provide more interaction and the press-your-luck aspect of leaving a planet before it's developed and perhaps not getting your goods by the end of the game. Interesting game that somebody might be able to redesign into a meatier game.

A very quick game of set collection, with absolutely gorgeous graphics. For some reason the cards do not match the graphic quality of the rest of the game, and look completely out of place.

Exceptional usability engineering: The shape of the VP tiles remind you that you are supposed to leave them at the planet until a base is built. Every tile also has its specific set collection scoring formula printed on it, so there's no need for player aids.

Fully randomized setup with some components left over in the box, guaranteeing lots of replayability.

Now I just need to find authentic Puddle Jumper miniatures to replace the perfectly fine original spaceships ;P

Space exploration in a stylised manner.  You are collecting tiles to give victory points which are themed to be aliens, minerals, water, and (for some reason) medals. It's strategic with a light theme, but a fun challenge because you need to make the most of your minimal amount of actions - only two per turn.  Best with 3 or 4 players, I think.

This one was surprisingly good. Essentially you are trying to find hidden treasures on planets and collect sets of treasures that form combos which score points for you (a bit similar to building combos in "7 Wonders"). You need to use your cards wisely in order to get to planets, search them for treasure and then finally retrieve that treasure. Theme also works very well and is not simply pasted on. Recommended!

Draw cards, see which planets you can settle. Move to said planet, play cards, repeat.

There is a push your luck mechanic whereby you can scan planets and put cards aside for yourself but you'll only score these if the planet is developed. It almost saves the game, but not quite.

Additional actions:
TRADE (once per turn) - like in Adv Civ?
ATTACK (once per turn) - attack other player or space station, mechanism card based? Winner gets a number of random loot and places loser on adjacent planet. Space station is destroyed, what type of loot?

Getting in to my space themes at the moment. Also I like games that play more than 4 and can resolve fairly quickly. At some point I'll be looking into reductionist 4x variant games for 4p or more that serve a similar purpose. As much as I do like Eclipse, 5p+ will take far too long for my groups. I realise I might not be able to offer the same experience as Eclipse which is fine, I'm happy to compromise.

If we're gaming for only three hours, my groups will want to play at least two games if not more. That's probably why I'm getting into so many medium games at the moment.

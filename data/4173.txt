I like the step reduction system in this game. AH could have cut the counter quantity in half by just back printing the counters.

RATING: 7
This may have a point for nostalgia and my personal back story of trying to acquire this years after I foolishly traded it.

This game has a whole lot that I love in a wargame.  First, it is fairly easy or fairly complex, depending on how many rules you want to implement (there are 4 sections of rules to add more realism and complexity).  The basic game is perfect for learning and has a low counter density, so the learning curve is not too steep.

The step reduction system was innovative and could be perfected with double-sided counters, but hey, someone had to invent the system, right?  A full color OOB would help in set-up as well.  The only (small) gripe I have is that, like [thing=426][/thing] and [thing=1442][/thing], the set-up takes a long, long time.

Once you have it set-up and ready to play, sit back and have a blast!  Various invasion zones allow you to study "what ifs" or play the historical path the Allies took.  On my first invasion, I thought, "this is easy".  Not.  The Germans reacted, got into defensive positions in the mountains, and it became a meat grinder to drive north.  And to make it worse, my port was in danger of getting overran during the German counter-offensive on the 2nd turn!  (And I was playing solitaire!)

Mine is a 1st ed. with the horrible box art, (Mussolini's face conforming to the Italian peninsula? I ask you!) and a game board done in crayon. Despite this, it is a good, albeit workman-like simulation of the Italian campaign. Though I wouldn't spend an evening playing the campaign game again, even at gunpoint. Once was enough.

RATING: 7
A 40 years old wargame... and you can easily realize that: graphics is primitive, rules are strange for modern standards, materials smell of ancient inks... Anyway a good, solid game, deeply and seriously studied before editing. If you want to play History, this is your game: everything (loss table, counters, names on the map etc) gives you the right sensation. I played the entire campaign and it easily can be very long; be aware: if your first invasion goes bad, you as Allied can do nothing creative: if German player is clever enough he builds a fortified line from Cassino to Adriatic Sea that is simply too though to break. This is probably the only limit (and what a limit!!!) of this game; so, allow the Allied player a decent invasion eliminating from play poor invasion options or the front line will get stuck in the South for months...annoying both players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Well if you like the Avalon Hill hex games then I would think you know all about this one. I like it alot and am playing a solitaire game of it now. Lots of fun to me and challenging for both sides. Try landing your first invasion from the Adriatic on the east coast of Italy for your first invasion. If you can pull it off it helps the allies flank that dreaded Cassino Line, and you may not have to do a second invasion. I like to pull units out for it though just to force the German to be worried about it. 
As the allies I suggest being extremely aggressive. Don't worry at all about taking lots of step losses as long as you are ending your turn with units adjacent to the enemy. Dont let your units become surrounded or destroyed though. Air power is almost useless for you though.
As the German, I suggest you counterattack vigorously small enemy breakthroughs, and dont let your losses scare you too much. Form reserves at the first sign of inactivity from the allied player. And if he wants to do a second invasion fine, you'll get several infantry divisions out of it. Ending your turn with several strong units in a good defensive posture adjacent to enemy units is always good.

It was quite advanced, with its step-system, invasion zones and all, for me when I was but a wee lad.  A decent game on a neglected theatre of war.  Too bad the Italian OB is so abysmal; I believe it reflects the pro-German, anti-Axis view (German units must be very very strong; Axis allied units must be very very weak) still dominant in many WWII wargames.

RATING: 9
My first real board wargame (after Afrika Korps). This really drew me into the hobby. It has a very nice level of detail with step losses, replacements, different options for amphibious assaults etc. As a player I got to make all the same sort of decisions as the commanders of the time and I really liked it. I have been playing boardgames ever since.
Now, after so many years, I still like the style of the map, the colours of the counters and the different options. It has so influenced the way I look at other games. After playing this game for instance, I cannot accept SS-units that aren't black. So maybe my score for this game is a bit biased....

A classic with four levels of rule complexity and several levels of game length. Played many times in the past. I would like to have the time to play a full campaign from '43 till '45 (this one is really long). An intriguing feature is the possibility for the German player to choose the level of commitment: at the maximum all of the German units originally in Italy under Rommel command are released, included both 1st and 2nd SS Pz Divisions... So you can taste also some what if's...

Fot the german quite depressing as it is only backwards with little offensive possibilities but on the other hand the defense can work well. The terrain excludes fastmoving maneuvers with armor but the game shows the nature of the fighting in Italy well.

RATING: 7
This is an exciting game - interesting set-up conditions where each player decides how big a force they wish to use - the more force you choose, the more you have to achieve to win. When I have played it, it has felt like a very mobile war with force being shifted from one side of Italy to the other fairly quickly.

It is an excellent introductory game for beginners due to the low counter density in the basic game.

I owe a lot to this game.  One cannot possibly defend Italy without at least accidentally learning something about using terrain.  Anzio taught me to assess my line continually, spotting my weaknesses before the attcker does, knowing where my next line of defense will be, preparing it in advance, positioning forces in the rear to secure against a breakthrough (or a landing in your rear).  As an attacker, I learned methods to fatally compromise a defensive line.  The wild variety of units, the exotic (for the time) CRT, the continual pressure to achieve/hold yet another objective made the game very satisfying.

A great classic wargame from Avalon Hill.  The 3 "modes" of play can provide anything from a very simple wargame to a game that is long, involved, and with many different events.  If all modes are mastered, it is very easy to get into the various scenarios and be able to play more.  Sadly, my guys weren't excited by this and there are newer games on my shelf.

Good: WW II - Operational - Easy/Medium

Plus:
-Great theme: the only game I know about the Italian Campaign
-4th Edition rules are great and rules are really intuitive. Don't know other Editions but rules come together really well.
-Low Counter density 
-Step reduction table is a nice touch
-Includes amphibious landings, Garibaldi Units, Commando's, tactical air Support etc.  
-I love the map, mounted, old School
-Accessible System, rules are easy, intuitive and counter density is low.
-I love the step reduction table. There ar elots of spare counters but I prefer this to regilar CRT's and flipping; no DE and AE results here.
-Great history, seems to be an excellent simulation of the historical Event while leaving all what if option's open. Many wargame feel scripted to achieve historic results but with Anzio there is virtually no chrome or rules forcing historic results.

Minus:
-Horrible counter color scheme: American's, British and Italians are hard to set apart. No green was used; beyond me why they did not make the US olive green...
-Rules are easy but there is quite some stuff to remember Advanced rules. Lay out sucks; all items to be remembered are numbered, horrible to read.
-Some player aids printed on both sides so you Need to make a copy.

I researched quite a bit but this is a proven System that has been refined and it shows when you play.
Interesting that this game is not that popular.

I always thought this game was epic compared to the other AH titles I had played before. It was the first lengthy campaign game that I had played with a significant number of units. 

I think I was drawn to the fact that there were various units of different nationalities with different colors. Step system was tedious but still I loved it. Played this to death!

In retrospect, this game mirrored closely the tough campaign of slogging it up the Italian boot that the Allies endured for 2 years.

One of my favorite games when growing up. Improved massively over several versions, and with Tom Oleson's considerable contributions. This one captured the 'feel' of the campaign better than any other game I've played on the subject. Quite simple to play, too.

The game gets the attritional nature of the campaign right by using step losses for units, the stronger divisions with many steps. So you get the gradual wearing down of the German army, but at a cost of spending a lot of turns (the turns are weekly) engaging in tedious low odds attacks with little to no movement. This was largely how the actual campaign progressed, just noting it in gameplay terms. The new No Rertreat game uses an attritional table to acoount for the static periods of the front, which is interesting. I think something similar could work in Anzio - the many turns of nothing much happening (and game length in general) is one of the weak points of the game. 

Still, I will always have fond memories of this colorful, fascinating game.

The prettiest of the 60's AH games.  Reasonably simple, yet rich in 'chrome', and always a challenge.  Still actively supported by an enthusiastic community despite being OOP for ages.
It took me a long time to come to grips with playing the Germans, having been eliminated early many, many times.  One must strike a balance between a fighting withdrawal and opportunistic attacks, all while watching one's flanks.

RATING: 7.5
This is another all time classic of Avalon Hill. No other game has been so much updated like this. I like playing this game (4th edition) despite being so old. Not many people appreciate the significance of the Italian Campaign. Very challenging indeed. Reasonably simple game to play. Despite this game can go on for far too long, but it is still very much enjoyable & well balanced. I will always keep this game in my collection for sure. This is a must for those who are Italian Campaign enthusiasts or are interested to learn more about the Italian Campaign of 1943-1945.

The Italian campaign is  rarely depicted in wargames. This is probably the most famous attempt.

Rather ancient rules make it a chore to play, especially the multiple counters (one per step) all of which are single sided, which is a waste.

The river rules are appalling, with the rivers running through hexes instead of hexsides, Consequently, there is a mass of rules requiring you to remember which side of the river you are on, you can move along a river but not cross it, defending a river means sitting one hex away from the river etc All this could be avoided simply by running the rivers along the hexsides. The map would be no less accurate, it is hardly a satellite image in any case.  

Other clunky rules: 
Units have one final step, the inverted (blank) side of their smallest step. Not a good mechanic, given that both sides look the same. 
Automatic victories: Always a terrible rule.
Mandatory combat: Always causes trouble, requiring defenders to rush out of their nice dug in positions to mount suicide attacks on an overwhelmingly powerful enemy. Soak-offs and other nonsense apply.
Counters: British are yellowy-orange, US are orangy-yellow. Could they not find another colour to make them easy to distinguish?

Despite this, there is an interesting, if clunky old school simulation in here.

The main attraction is the basic scenario (Sept-Dec 1943), a chess-like puzzle played on the South part of the map with a handful of counters. It has been played and analyzed to death by the usual grognards. Playing the whole campaign to 1945 is too long and probably boring. I sold my copy in 2003.

Includes counters from the original first edition (Germans in pink, orange, and black) and counters from the last edition (Germans are gray-green, gray-blue, and black). Rules and set-up cards from the first edition and last edition included, but the original set-up cards have been marked to clarify set-up and conditions for entry. Mapboard is from the original edition, plus an excellent self-made extension map to include the rest of Italy in colors that match the original mapboard. Box is intact, but shows some wear. Original counters have been played, but still in good shape. The other counter set is punched, but not played.

Rating based on tournament play:

Viable invasion sites really limited to two beaches as the remainder are highly problematic. Once ashore, there is no room to maneuver and little opportunity for finesse. It's simply a matter of bludgeoning forward hoping for the needed dice rolls to gain ground. As far as an invasion game goes, Fortress Europa and even the old D-Day provide more options. I hear Oleson is working on the 7th edition (or is it 8th?). Why? What more can be said? A basic wargaming staple, nothing more and nothing less.

Anzio is a fantastic strategy game. It was one of the first (if not the first) in using step reduction for units attrition on combat. Well, compared with today games, system for step reduction is clearly outdated. There are no backside counters or similar, each unit is divided on a series of breakdown parts that represent this reduction. This is tedious and make setup too long (as in the most of the TAHGC titles by the way). But for 1973 (I am talking about 4th edition) it was a great idea and established a standard for the coming games. In the other side, Anzio can be played in many ways from simple basic to a full complex campaign. So you can expend a little time or as much as you want (and have). From a strategic point of view, Anzio offers a fantastic approach and a lot of fun. Invasions, beachheads and ports are some of the logistic possibilities you can play. Map and terrain effects are the most important strategic key for winning. Supply rules are basic and important due to the most of the combats are made on the coast area. More for defending than for attacking, enemy isolation is one of the best tactics you can use.Anzio is great too for learning Italian geography :) and from an historical point of view. Orders of Battle are a very good list about all involved forces. Nice historical commentaries and designer's notes. Finally, I rank this game 8.0 because despite to the time passed it is still possible to enjoy a lot with it. Maybe some today company can update this one to the nowadays standards and reprint this title again I think it would be great.

One of the few Avalon Hill games that I have bought recently that I did not own as a kid.  This was one I always came terribly close to acquiring, but never did, perhaps because of the color of the map, but most likely because I envisioned a logjam of opposing lines across the narrow Italian peninsula.  I was terribly wrong.  The low unit density in the Basic Game (the only version I play) and the high movement values makes this game extremely fluid and a blast to play.  

Having played this for a year now, I find Anzio to be unparalleled in providing the opportunity for gut-wrenching decisions.  I have never spent so much time contemplating a move as when I'm confronted with even a typical turn in Anzio.

It's like a new and improved version of Splendor, only with far superior art, themeing, and game-play! To be a contrary voice, I think the graphics of the game are great...with the exception of the prices on the cards: why, oh why, are they in such small print?

A great game, made only greater by the presence of monkeys on ostriches!

An interesting mix of co-operative (in the sense that you share resources) and competitive styles. Ideal for female gamers and male gamers that aren't afraid to dress in fancy outfits.

Seems pretty luck based. The cards you want can get cleared easily before you ever get a chance to get them, event cards can come out and really screw your over, players can get benefits while not participating. I just think a lot of other games are better with set collection and vp. That said, the art is marvelous. But, costs were really hard to read from across the table, it required people to grab the cards to see if they weren't right next to them. Despite the luck, final scores weren't too spread. 5 = average. I'd probably give it 4 if it weren't for the art, which may be worth owning the game for some. Person who taught it was super nice.

RATING: 7
Very interesting "deck builder" game where there is a shared board that determines food and money incomes for everyone.  On your turn you can either get food or get money, and then buy as many cards as you want, and acquire banners like you do nobles in Splender.  I enjoyed it because it is an efficiency game where you want to go the most you can in one turn with a bit of an eye for later scoring.

RATING: 6
Nice gateway game in which you build your tableau by trying to maximize the values of your cards mostly through set collection. Very easy to learn and players all play female characters, which is a rare thing in a board game. The game would be really enjoyable if the graphic design wasn't so bad. The text is often hard to read and the cost of cards is just so tiny. Good for families!

Played twice at GenCon 2015. Designer is a woman whose quest for female empowerment has taken the form of this terrific game. You play as the daughter of a powerful queen whose health is fading and who needs to name a successor. Your job, as one of her princesses, is to assemble the most impressive court of fantastic beasts, advisors, works of art, etc. It is an easy to pick up suit collection game with a splash of cooperative interaction. The art is great, and the fact that you play as one of a group of SISTERS is a breath of fresh, feminist air in the oft-stifling masculine world of board games. Regardless of gender, you will love Monarch.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Finally, a game with a female-empowering theme but gameplay that is just as thoughtful as a good game should be.  The simple rules are good for light gamers, but the interaction effects between the cards makes for a strategic experience for geek gamers.

The box has a very nice finish, the cards are fantastic. A linen texture over everything! The tokens are great, very thick and chunky. The insert is thick and sturdy. Overall, a very nicely presented game! :)

Not a very interesting game.  Too hard to control certain things so a bit chaotic.  Given that, it's hard to put too much thought into strategy if someone can change most things on the board on their turn at pretty low cost.
King making is a problem as well.
I wasn't miserable while playing it, but have no desire to play it again.

This game labels itself as “semi-cooperative” but being both cooperative and competitive at the same time just doesn’t work in this game or add anything that is tangibly worth anything to existing games.  The whole time we were playing we said we were getting a muddled Splendor feeling here, but rather than play this thing, we just wanted to go play Splendor.  All players are going to basically have to start the exact same way: must get food to get more money and then get some good cards.  It’s very predictable and stagnant.  Moon cards and Unwanted Guest cards just throw unpredictable randomness and take-that things in your face and just muddle the game play.  This feels like a homemade print-and-play Splendor that should have never gone to the printers.

I really liked the concept of the game.  I believe after a few more plays a depth to the strategy of the game will emerge.  Theme is excellent!  Really liked the art work.

RATING: 5
There is a lot to like here but it's undone by a laxity that feels obviously wrong.

What's to like is how you build your card tableau. You use food to pay for taxing to get gold and use gold to buy cards. You can only do one of harvest food/tax gold each turn and there are some nice decisions to be made there.

Where the game goes off the rails in terms of trying to be another compact, Splendor type, mini-strategy game is in how many things a player can do on your turn. As the game ramped up, our turns were taking 2-4 minutes per player which means it could be about 10 minutes between turns.

And that's because after your one harvest/tax action, you can do an unlimited number of other actions. So on a turn you may end up doing all of these:

Buy a card
See what new card comes into the market
Pay for a new land tile to increase the taxation rate
Tax gold
Use gold to buy a card
See what new card comes into the market
Deal with an event that comes out that affects everyone at the table
See what new card comes into the market
Wipe the market of new cards
Review the 5 new cards that just came in
etc

If players could only buy one card or only wipe the market at the beginning of their turn or ... something to limit them, it would hum along instead of plodding. There's practically nothing you can plan for when it's not your turn because things change so much and the when it's your turn, you have to assess all the changes and figure out what to do as per the example above. Even 2 minutes per player in a 4P game is 6 minutes between turns, and when you're not planning your next move, it feels more pronounced.

For such a small game, the downtime feels way more pronounced than the depth of decisions. I want to like this game but it seems in need of one more layer of development.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: joc de cartes on l'objectiu és aconseguir juntar 7 cartes de regne davant de cada jugador. El jugador que tingui més punts entre les cartes que té davant guanya la partida. En ordre de torn, cada jugador fa accions entre: aconseguir menjar o or (pagant menjar) o comprar cartes d'una oferta central. Hi han 4 tipus de cartes diferents: de regne (que van davant de cada jugador), de puteig (que les assignes a un altre jugador), millora (serveix per guanyar més or o més menjar) i events, que es resolen quan surten i requereixen la "cooperació" entre els jugadors. Les cartes de regne tenen diferents tipus, i algunes donen més punts en funció del nombre de cartes d'aquell tipus que tens davant teu (set collection).

Molt sencill, el temà és totalment superflu. Si que és veritat que em recorda una mica al Splendor, potser amb una mica més de complicació, però poca cosa... No m'interessa.

2015-10-13 - 6 - This is an OK card game with a common pool of resources which was an interesting thing. Other than that it is a little bit a card engine builiding game with nice artwork, but nothing I would really like to play too often.

I enjoy the game, and the art is beautiful. It can end very quickly depending on how much everyone builds up the kingdom, trying to do too much engine-building will likely burn you in the end because another player could just finish the game by buying random cards before you can complete your engine.

Not a bad game that has been likened to Splendor and probably shouldn't.  Monarch has a much more subtle strategy.   It's also not as good as Splendor, imo.  Repeated games start to feel very similar.  Plays better with 3-4 but the 2-player rules are fine.

Pros:

This is a tableau building game with some Euro-lite elements such as acquiring resources and transforming them into other resources. There's also set collection where some cards will combo off each other.

Cons:

Kind of feels like a deck building game even though it's not. You buy cards from the market, but it's really easy to get lots of resources quickly and you can keep flushing the market until you get the cards you want. The game just feels very easy going and there's no tension at all. This may be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what you're looking for at the moment.

Enjoyed the game the first few times I played. Good balance of relaxing game play and the tense dynamics of beating your rivals to certain cards and combos...However, one of my group found a bit of a loophole that forced the end of the game. Specifically, the lack of a limit on how many cards can be purchased per round. They just bought the cheapest cards they could, while everyone else was working on combos, and ended the game with seven cards with their opponents only having 3 or 4.

RATING: 9
It’s a 2-4 person card buying strategy game. It has few pieces, short easy directions, and won’t take too long to learn and play.

Essentially all the players are princesses vying to be queen of the land.  The board is laid out by drawing 9 tiles that represent either a farm or a town. The goal is to use those resource to get food or gold and then “buy” things to make the grandest court.  Those items can be decorations, entertainments, foods, exotic beasts. Each item has a point value, and those point values can double or triple if you buy things in certain combinations… they can also zero out if the wrong thing is added to your court.  Beware, your fellow monarch can send nuisance relatives to visit and that deduct from your court’s value.  You can also upgrade a town or farm to produce more gold and food.  There are a few other mechanics in the game that can help or hinder you along the way that you have little control over, making it a little tougher than you think to get the perfect court.

The artwork in this game is stunning,  but that is also my one complaint. The cards are painted in dark color, with small black print on them.  We found that anytime a new card was added, we all had to pick it up to read what it does. But if that is the only thing that makes this game an issue, then it’s not really that bad… just look closely at the cards and enjoying building your court!

I give MONARCH a very solid A

What is the point of the modular board? There is none. Wasted opportunity.  The thick land tiles could've easily been cards. This should have been a  $10 card game in a small box. It's extremely simple. I only paid $20 for this but that still seems high. There is virtually zero strategy. Keep buying cards until you have seven.  If you don't have enough money you tax. If you don't have enough food you harvest. Decisions are always obvious. Getting banners is simple. There was  opportunity here to add some strategic elements to the land tiles and nothing was done with it.  It's almost like they added land tiles to the game in order to make the box bigger. The card art is great but it's not enough to save this game from utter mediocrity.

I saw this on a booth table at GenCon and was amazed at the look of the game, and watching some of the play I realized this was not another deck builder, but something different and was drawn in to learn more. I was then given a demo of the game by a lovely, engaging woman who was bubbling with enthusiasm. This was of course Mary Flanagan, designer of this amazing game. I played a two player game and lost but was entranced with the interactions and depth of the game. I went back several times over the rest of the weekend hoping to get to play the game some additional times but the tables were always packed. I was informed that it was available to preorder and I could not pay fast enough. I know that when I get my copy it will hit the game table nearly every game night.

Really enjoyable set collection game with beautiful art.  I really enjoy the concept of the competition for leadership via leadership paths (banners) rather than via force.  Having all the players play females is a refreshing change.  It doesn't affect play at all but makes people think.  If all the characters were male, no one would even blink.  The semi-cooperative Moon cards are another great touch.  Everyone benefits if you can cooperate.  Game is playable with 2 players with the new rules.  3 player is good, but the four player game really shines.  The cards move quickly and the competition for paths is real.  The deck turns over at least 2 times during a 4 player game.  I'm having a lot of fun with it.

Played twice at Gen Con. Demoed the first day with a friend and we kept talking about how we wished we had a copy to play at the hotel. The two of us returned the second day to demo it with another friend. 

Quick to learn but deeper than it first seems. I suspect the game will keep going for years. The artwork is beautiful without being distracting. I'd be curious to see it in black and white although the colors work well to enhance the legibility of the cards. I look forward to the addition of new cards and mechanics.

RATING: 5
Monarch is a light filler-ish game. Players are princesses vying to be chosen by the queen as the next monarch. There's a communal board which is seeded either with towns or farms. There's a card market with land upgrades and scoring cards.

On your turn you can buy as many cards from the card market as you want, flush the market for 3 coins, and once per round either tax or harvest. Harvest gets you apples from the farms for free. Taxing gives you money for every town you give an apple. Cards can cost money, apples or both. At the beginning of the game you only get 1 apple per farm when harvesting and 1 gold per town when taxing, but those can be upgraded via purchases from the card market. Those upgrades are permanent and benefit all players from that point on.

Cards come in four or five different flavors, and there's usually an incentive to specialize in a particular flavor. Once you have two cards of a flavor, you can claim the matching banner, which gives you a cool ability and some end-game scoring stuff. Only one player can take any banner and once you choose one, you can't get rid of the one you have or get a different one.

There's also random events that happen, that can be good/bad/or just meh. Some of them require all the players as a group to pay a cost to trigger the benefit, which can make for interesting negotiation when a particular player wants the benefit but the others don't.

The game ramps up quickly as the lands get upgraded, and taxing and harvesting get more potent. The last turn of our game ended being huge for one player. It seemed like going last was a bit of an advantage.

The game is interesting, but seems like it isn't quite balanced. It's fine for a filler, but it almost feels like it wants to be a deeper game, and it is a little too flawed to work as a deeper game for me.

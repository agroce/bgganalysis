Takes Men of Iron system, and adds a little bit of the
(needed, IMO) detail from GBoH, to create a still very
playable but more interesting design.

The way victory snowballs - or a battle may just end due
to fatigue, these are very nice ideas. I can see some not
wanting their 'hard fought' win taken away from them by
such luck factors, but it is very true to the era.

The game provides meeting engagement as well as historical
set-piece set-ups for each scenario - which is a nice touch.

Very attractive components - maybe too much so. Cheaper
material could give a couple more battles at the same price.

My rating is for the moment cautiously at 7.  It's more the subject than the rules system which I find interesting and well done.  Check Battles Magazine.
Looking forward to play it again.

Un matériel élégant même si il n'est pas encore à la hauteur des plus grandes compagnies (mes pions avaient un décalage par exemple).
Des règles très claires pour un système d'activations sans tours. Une étonnante attribution des points de victoire qui donnent des frissons en fin de partie si la partie est serrée. Pas de fioritures tactiques, c'est du rentre dedans, ce qui correspond bien aux "habitudes" de l'époque.
Le soucis vient de deux des trois scénarios qui sont trop favorables à un camp étant donné les nombreuses règles spéciales qui accablent le perdant historique.
Heureusement, les scénarios avec "placement libre" rééquilibrent tout cela, car sinon, la durée de vie du jeu serait limitée...Néanmoins, une très agréable surprise.

Benevento historique - bataille complètement déséquilibrée en faveur des Guelphs. Le commandement de l'armée Ghibelline est complètement handicapé par l'interdiction de jets de continuation ou d'interruption. Les Guelphs peuvent dérouler leurs assauts sans trop craindre les réactions adverses. A jouer en solo pour découvrir le système.

Campaldino historique - bataille très favorable aux Guelphs aidés en cela par un seuil très faible pour changer de niveau de victoire (4 points contre 8 pour les Ghibellines). La situation est très étriquée et se résume principalement à un affrontement de cavalerie et une bataille d'usure. La supériorité numérique des Guelphs devrait leur donner la victoire sans trembler.

Montaperti historique - la plus grosse bataille du lot et la plus palpitante. Les Guelphs doivent à tous prix empêcher les Ghibellines d'obtenir leurs renforts. Pour cela ils doivent faire la course en tête ce qui est l'assurance d'une partie sans temps morts.

Very nice medieval game, a good mix of MoI and GBOH, with something new as extra! Played Campaldino, it is very interesting and playable and gives the right flavour of the Medieval Italian battles.

I normally do not like medieval set battles.
After setting up a scenario with a friend it actually passed several weeks before we decided to try the game.

What a blast it was when we played it. I was truly drawn into the game.

Actually it was my friends copy we played, but I have ordered my own copy before we even had finished the first scenario.

What really made this game was a the very good mechanic of representing the physical fatigue affecting troops. This made the battle much more interesting because you actually has to conserve the stamina of your troops because they will lose their offensive values once they are to tiered.

The system also forces one to press for victory when one is winning the battle since their is a big risk of a draw result due to that both forces become to tired to actually get a decisive result.

This is definitely the best medieval war game I have ever played and one that I really like.

This is the best of the "Medieval Tactical Systems" that I have ever played.  I deeply enjoyed it.  The way commanders wear down and become much less effective the more you use them and the combination of various scenarios makes this a definite game of awesomeness!

one of the best effort I've seen in years to depict the effect of army disruption in an ancient/medieval battle. Federico developed a very interesting mechanic that integrate loss of "materiel", fatigue and overall confusion. 
Played two scenarios and "sa battalla".
Rated 8 because I consider the combat system not at the same level of the morale/disruption/fatigue system, nevertheless a great game system.

RATING: 7
Not overly complex, very fast-playing system that is a lot of fun to play. The battles just spiral into chaos and there are many feedback loops built into the system to ensure that things get out of control (e.g. accelerating victory: as victory levels get higher, they have a higher probabilty of being raised).

Beautiful components, especially the maps (although differences in elevation and the distinction of hills can be tough to spot under some light). My counters were poorly aligned on their backs but nothing that prevents me from playing.

Few-ish scenarios, but when you consider variants (historical vs free set-up plus sometimes different victory levels for short or long games) it's not bad.  Plus, though I don't know for sure yet, I think given its medium complexity and propensity for chaos, it might be a nice game to break out with a friend every once in a while even if you've previously played the scenarios.

RATING: 9
This was a blast to play, I solo'd all three scenarios...very clever and comprehendible rules with no errata, bravo! I doubt i will ever be interested in Men of Iron again; despite umpteen iterations, that system pales in comparison to this one, which actually seems to have been thoughtfully developed. And needless to say, an A+ for aesthetics

Guelphs & Ghibellines drives you through the Art of War in XIIIth century in Italy and it is a great game in all his components: 

the box is in very resistant thick cardboard;

the large counters are great with the well visible characteristics and their spectacular graphics with the outline of the Infantrymen and Cavalry and with the heraldic symbols of every faction;
foot units are represented by infantry, archers, crossbowmen, palvesari, etc

the maps introduces a coloration very pleasant crayon and the large hexagons;

there are no turns but the system of game is simple and accurate with a continuos series of Capitano (Leader) activations, and it emphasizes the fatigue of the formations during the course of the battle.

In the game are simulated the battles of Montaperti, Benevento and Campaldino; the battle of Montaperti is the biggest battle with his 50.000 around soldiers.

All in all a must to have for the lovers of the historical period, and for the lovers of the Good Games!

The Italians have done it again on their familiar subject - medieval Europe battles. Professional production is far more superior than those in the U.S.  Preordered in Apr and arrived in Jun 09.  Phew!  The first Italian wargame I have!! 

The game differentiate units with different missle firing capabilities (yes, the crossbowman is firing at a faster rate than the archer here!), shock combat, armour class, even heroes and knighthood (standard bearer) from the "Capitano" (the Army Leader).

The game takes the now popular activations based mechanics to simulate the time and movement in a day's time. Activating a Capitano is a basic activation and he can continue activate with a "Continuum", subject to enemy's "Interruptio".  A Capitano is activated when a roll of 2 dices results in equal to or greater than the Capitano's current Command Capacity (given by the number on the Command Capacity marker).  An interruption always reduces a Capitano's "Command Capacity" by 1 and Capitano on interruption receives only half the command order points currently available from the Capitano's capacity (So use this more carefully at critical time!)  The only way to restore a Capitano's Command Capacity is to release a reserve or perform a "Recovery" order.  A Capitano, however, can always be activated in any manner a maximum 2 times in a row.

At the core of the game is the "Capitano Activation Sequence".  A Capitano's "Command Capacity" is the number of order points that a Capitano receives when he is activated.  He uses these order points to move, fire and attack with his in-command units of his own battalion (only). An enemy unit would block the command range of a Capitano but an enemy's ZOC would not. The command range is calculated at the time when the command order is given and so a very active and brave Capitano can issue orders and then move and then issue orders again to other previously out of command range units.  Besides, a command range is "extended" through a series of units of the same battalion!  Take note of this when planning your attack with the units and keep the enemy out of your line command.           

There are a total of 8 types of orders, all but the echoleon attack by cavalry (see below) cost 1 order point.  Units out of command can still move, fire and withdraw but at a higher 2 order points cost.  It is a very neat way to simulate the major effects of units being out of command and line battle tactics so pavelent at those days.   

Missle firing suffers a -1 penalty upon face changing.  The firing is resolved on a "Fire Table" by rolling 2 dices against the target's armour and firing range, adding the firing unit's cohesion rating (the rule says "Rating" only but I guess this is the only rating any unit has).  A result exceeding (or equal to) the no. in the table causes a hit.    

Some good cavalry rules on charging (a column shift to the attacker on the "Shock Combat Table"!), countercharging and echoleon attack depict the cavalry role at the time of medieval tactics.  Any units attacking the cavalry should take a cohesion check for possible disruption (a single die roll greater than the cohesion rating).  The target units of a cavalry charge would also take a cohesion check. Two cavalry units can swap with each other "magically" with the echoleon attack order.  I have yet to figure out the advantage of this swap.   

The second disruption on any target unit calls for a cohesion hit roll under any circumstances, i.e. taking a dieroll result difference to the unit's current cohesion rating as additional cohesion hits (a minimum 1 cohesion hit except for those incurred in a shock combat).  A unit's current cohesion rating is indicated by a marker.  A missle unit can make reaction fire at no cost to enemy movement into its two frontal hexes too (as always, only those missle units not yet fired before).  This could be a very powerful defensive posture unless they are disrupted in the face of a cavalry charge.  

Shock combats take place with the lead unit attacking.  The appropriate columns on the Shock Combat Table are first determined after taking into a number of factors (poistion and numerical advantage, unit type comparison, cavalry charge, diruption units involved (both sides), armor class comparison, terrain etc.  Then 2 dices are rolled with modifiers like cohesion hits differential, presence of the heroes or Capitano, enemy unattacked but adjacent to the attacking unit etc.  Results are the number of cohesion hits taken.   

Rules on face changing are very clear, mostly paying one movement point to change any number of vertex at a time and free for advance after combat (one vertex only though).  Units cannot change facing in an enemy ZOC (exception: retreat and advance after combat), nor in another friendly unit hex while moving.  Reaction face changing can be triggered one vertex while an enemy unit enters and stops in a unit's flank or rear.  If Caesar at Alesia (a GBoH game) can have such a "face-changing" rules clarity, it would elevate the game to a classic level.           

There are 3 scenarios in the game.  The only comparable currently available in the market is Richard Berg's "Men of Iron".  I am interested to compare the two more in future.

Tentative rating after one solo play. Very clever activation system, and it works very well solo. Components are really good, except that the backs of the counters in my copy were really badly misaligned.

Rules are well laid out, but make sure you get the FAQ and the player aid.

I think these battles use a really good system for medieval warfare, one that is way better than the one of the Man of Iron series. Especially the rules for initiative and leader activation are much less random and arbitrary.

My favourite medieval wargame, in complexity somewhere between Men of Iron and GBOH. In fact, it hits the sweet spot for easily playable yet realistic. Also, amazing rulebook that does not leave any questions open. Lastly, great company, which quickly replaced a misprinted counter sheet. A bigger publisher should REALLY pick up this game series.

Played Benevento scenario. Need to reread rules agin to catch what I didn't previously retain.One-sided for the Guelphs; perhaps the Ghibellines should get 1 Victory Level/4 or 5 VP instead of the 7 needed by the Guelphs (for play balance).

Much better that GBoH in reducing complexity, especially since so much of Ancient battles is based on (informed) speculation. Also the CH markers are smaller than the counters in G&G, unlike GBoH.

Hits the sweet spot between Great Battles of History and Men of Iron.  While it has the "cohesion hit" system of the former, it is a bit cleaner, and the command system is less gamey than the latter.  The Victory Level mechanic seems new to me, and gives a nice uncertainty as to how much further the game has to go.  Seems to model medieval combat well in that it is hard to disengage and regroup your battered troops once they are in the thick of it, and while things can hang in the balance for a while, eventually it tips and falls apart for one side or the other.  The command system and its precipitous degradation leads to reasonable historical and non-trivial decisions about when to continue and interrupt.  Even the biggest battle in the box can finish in three hours or less.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 7.5
Ancora non mi esprimo con un voto ché non ho ancora giocato neppure uno scenario, però mi sento di dire che il gioco ha un'ottima grafica. Le regole somigliano parecchio a quelle di Men of iron di Berg però hanno delle differenze interessanti. Prima di tutto per i command points e poi perché, finalmente, gli arcieri non sono così devastanti come nel gioco di Berg. Mi sono sempre chiesto che cosa passava per la testa di un arciere quando si vedeva caricare da cavalleria pesante. Secondo Berg l'arciere rimaneva a piè fermo, poi incoccava la freccia, con flemma olimpionica, e poi mirava con calma...scoccate! E tutti gli arcieri scoccavano le loro frecce: zac zac zac zac zac zac. Vi siete mai cimentati a Men of iron? Avete mai visto che fine fa una carica frontale di cavalleria pesante? Cavalieri disarcionati e in disordine, come minimo. E' mai possibile? Bravo Federico che ha ridotto l'efficienza degli arcieri (d'accordo: gli archi italiani non erano come i longbows inglesi, ok va bene) e introdotto il controllo morale prima della carica: saggia decisione. 
Ho cominciato a giocare lo scenario di Campaldino. Prima con lo schieramento storico e poi con quello "free". I guelfi sono doppi rispetto ai ghibellini, però hanno uno schieramento che non gli consente di sfruttare la superiorità. La mappa è piccola e  speranze di fare grandi manovre aggiranti non ce ne sono. Nel campo ghibellino Montefeltro ha a disposizione le unità più forti di tutta la battaglia: 6H Montefeltro e 6M alleati; la prima con sopra il capitano Montefeltro e la seconda coi paladini diventano dei trattori. Per sconfiggerle bisogna sfruttare il fatto che devono avanzare dopo il combattimento e quindi aggirarle sul fianco. In uno scontro frontale non ce n'è. Nello scenario "free" ho schierato l'armata ghibellina come segue: fianco sinistro ancorato all'Arno: battaglia Montefeltro; centro: battaglia Pazzo con fianco destro coperto dal bosco; indietro, in riserva, e un pò in ritardo, la fanteria del vescovo di Arezzo leggermente spostata verso destra. L'armata guelfa: fianco destro ancorato all'Arno due cavallerie della battaglia di Durfort con dietro le altre cavallerie; al centro la battaglia di Vieri e poi al fianco di Vieri la compagnia bianca con fianco sinistro nel bosco; oltre il bosco la fanteria di Mangiatori. Maghinardo e Donati in riserva a tre esagoni dalla prima linea; mentre Guido Novello molto dietro la prima linea ghibellina nei pressi del Carroccio (Certomondo Abbey). 
Nei primi turni ho provato con Montefeltro a fare più danni possibili e infatti: una cavalleria (Anjou) in rotta e un'altra decisamente malconcia, però non mi sento d'aver ottenuto chissà quale risultato. Il problema è che gli scontri avvengono fronte contro fronte. Nella shock table si parte dalla colonna "0" e per arrivare a colonne un pò più favorevoli non è banale. Gli unici shift su cui si può sperare sono: l'armor class e il fatto che il difensore sia disrupted. Peccato che gli shift più consistenti siano dato dall'attaco sul fianco e da quello sul retro della pedina difendente. Così l'avanzata non è rapidissima e i command points si esauriscono presto. In più: il fatto che i difensori siano in due linee adiacenti non è uno svantaggio perché qualora una pedina dovesse ritirasi su di un esagono con pedina amica subirebbe solo 1CH di penalità e non, ad esempio, l'eliminazione; e ancora: esiste un'ordine che si chiama: echelon, in cui due pedine possono interscambiarsi il posto anche in zoc nemica, ovvero: se io ho una pedina malconcia in zoc nemica posso, spendendo due OP, arretrarla nell'esagono di una cavalleria fresca e, quest'ultima, avanzarla nell'esagono abbandonato.
Intanto le fanterie guelfe fiorentino-emiliane stanno aggirando il fianco destro ghibellino...
Mangiatori arriva all'appuntamento con il vescovo d'Arezzo in debito di CC sicchè l'offensiva si arresta dopo un iniziale scontro in cui viene eliminata una pedina di arcieri ghibellina presa sul fianco. Poi Corso Donati si desta dal suo stato di riserva ed elimina una cavalleria ghibellina. A quel punto con il tempo che tende al temporale e con la scarsità di CC rimasti da ambo le parti tiro un bel 10 in un continuum et voilà: il pareggio è servito.
Ora sì che mi esprimo con un voto.

Rules are pretty easy to understand.  Each scenario has several unique rules.  First scenario was close and tense.  Activation continuum and interruptio are somewhat similar to GBOH, but easier to handle.  The steadily decreasing command capacity simulates the steadily increasing chaos of a battle group the longer as the battle progresses.  There are several combat modifiers, but they are pretty straightforward.  Looking forward to more games.

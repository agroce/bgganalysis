It feels like there are really 2 base mechanics in the series, with one spawning from GIPF, and the other DVONN.  This game seems to fall into the latter with very little in common to GIPF.

A solid abstract strategy game, but the random setup has always been a detracting factor for me.

RATING: 9
Awesome little abstract that has a lot of satisfying "CLICK-Clacking" of the pieces as they are struck from the board.  Lots of death in this game.  The game does play kind of similarly if a player is mindful of his/her pieces, however.

Seems like a great game, just not my cup of tea.  Far to many options to choose from makes it a sit and think type of game like chess which is just not fun for me.

Super game, will especially appeal to chess players. I got a copy and played it with my grandfather probably about 40 times in 2 weeks. Awesome.

On a technical level, this is the game that has the most - "lets look at that from a different angle" moments (kind of like in "Quarto!") which makes the games amazingly dynamic for their short length.

The box calls this one a "Pure Strategy Game" and that is accurate. This is the only abstract I have bought in the last 5 years and I like it enough to consider picking up some of the other GIPF series games. It's a great game and only takes 15 to 20 mins (max) so we generally play best of 3 or best of 5.

RATING: 8
Much faster play than I thought it was going to be.  I felt constantly pressured to make good choices or lose quickly.  This pressure would make the choices too simple except that the game's objectives and movement possibilities change mid-way, punishing short-term decision-making.  I would play this over DVONN if I want a faster game, but after DVONN if I want a more contemplative game.

RATING: 10
TZAAR combines the best parts of GIPF (survival requirement), ZERTZ (two-step move), DVONN (stacking and shrinking board), and YINSH (movement) in another new abstract game.  The biggest flaw of this game is also the same as DVONN: an intermediate player who has some knowledge of basic strategy will rarely lose to a novice (though in this game the novice has a better chance because there are more things to pay attention to, and the better player can lose by a single dumb mistake).  I recommend that you read my review and strategy articles.

In my eyes this is second only to Yinsh in the Gipf project series! An excellent abstract game but the setup is a bit of a bother for me. It might be the most "aggresive" in the series so if you like your games more "peaceful" you should look more for Yinsh or if you have Yinsh check out Gipf.

While there are reminders of several Gipf series games in Tzaar, the one it seems closest to is Dvonn.  Like Dvonn, it has stacking and movement options that rapidly diminish as the game progresses. 

One of Tzaar's clevernesses is to offer two distinct ways to win; capture all of one of your opponent's three types of piece or leave them without a legal move.  The first condition appears to offer the clearer route to victory, yet games are often decided by the second.  

Another element that I like is the two-part move; in the first part you must capture, in the second capture again or stack your pieces.  The temptation is to chase that elimination victory condition, but stacking is often the better option.

Tzaar is very accessible and devoid of the unintuitive elements of other Gipf series games.  Where I think it falls short of greatness is in a lack of strategic options.  A very few games are sufficient to learn how you should play - the rest is tactical.

Finally got around to playing Tzaar and found it interesting in some respects, but not nearly enough to want to play it again.   Still, it does have some interesting ideas in it, though, on the other hand, the pieces are not as much fun to play around with in your hands as the pieces in Yinsh or Dvonn.

TZAAR is beautifully elegant. It's perfectly simple and yet breathtakingly deep. 

I have a thing for well made abstract-strategy games, and as far as I'm concerned, TZAAR is the reigning king of abstract-strategies.

I really like YINSH. It's mechanics are simple and yet deep. It however feels like a race or competition, whereas TZAAR is nothing less than a fight to the death.

Kris Burm is a genius.

RATING: 4
I don't actually have anything bad to say about this game as far as mechanics go, I'm just not a fan of this type of abstract game in general.
Like many abstract games, the people who are just plain better than you will beat you mercilessly every time.  This isn't a flaw, it's just not my cup of tea.  It's not more fun than Chess, and I think I can only  handle one of this sort of game in a lifetime.
And anyhow, the Chess beatings don't seem nearly so merciless as the beatings in these GIPF games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A replacement for TAMSK in the Project GIPF line-up, it is easy to see how this game aligns better with the rest of the set.  It does not have the same newness feel that the rest of series had and its inclusion casts a shadow that makes PUNCT the new odd man out.  All that aside, the game on its own is quite good.  Good decision making combined with an accelerating pace make this game a very good abstract.  Games will feel challenging and players will easily want to 'try again' even after several plays.  A well designed and thought out game.

Swift and deep game play--one of my top games of the Gipf series

RATING: 10
Absolutely fantastic. I actually prefer DVONN to this one but this is just great all the same. The spacing of the board is just right, and like DVONN the game does an amazing job with decisions impacting the game more and more the deeper you get in. This game actually feels a little more liberating when it comes to strategy as you can try doing a wrecking ball strategy or try and dominate with board presence. Great, great game.

With as many plays as I have with this game I can say that it is better than DVONN like many people feel. I gotta say, I love this game. Together with YINSH and The Duke, easily my favorite abstract games. Hell probably my favorite games period.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
At first feels even better than YINSH, but where the change of endless freedom in the early game to severe lack of freedom in the end-game at first feels wonderful, the resulting strategies seem to make replayability go down.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a very nice game. It looks nice, and it plays nice. The rules are, as with most GIPF-series games, really easy to learn, but there's much more to meet the eye.

The need to protect your pieces, all the while needing to capture every turn is just brilliant. Most of the time, doing one of those things lets you vulnerable towards the other. It's all about finding that balance.

Overall, one of my favorite GIPF games. Rating might go up with more plays.

RATING: 9
If I had to characterize this game with one word, it might be "pursuit." There is a feeling of being chased--or doing the chasing--and each move involves considerations of stack positioning, area control, and careful manipulation the strength and numbers of your and your opponents' pieces. 

In the transition from mid- to endgame there is an ultimate goal of whittling away the possible moves of your opponent so that they may be eliminated first. If neither player loses one of their three types of pieces, all of your previous decisions will culminate in a few final moves wherein you have hopefully positioned yourself to be more
mobile than your opponent.

An excellent game!

Este juego me lo enseño Diego García en Candinamia 2009, y unos meses después acabé comprandomelo.

Es un juego abstracto del proyecto gipf.. con un ligero parentesco con las damas. En cada turno puedes comer o hacerte mas fuerte. 

Es rápido de jugar y explicar, pero lo cierto es que he tenido pocas oportunidades de jugarlo.

I don't seem to reach for this as much as I do for DVONN, but it's got a lot of depth to it and is no more difficult to learn than any other GIPF game.  I do wonder if scattering the pieces about randomly to start the game is really the best way to go, though.  Couldn't we take turns placing them?

Edit, 7 to 7.5 after a few more plays.  I really like how Tzaar's four victory paths interact.  The result is an initiative-driven game where I suspect the correct play is not to commit heavily to any one strategy but rather to menace your opponent on all sides.

Love the different endgame conditions (similar to ZERTZ) and I love the tension of trying to pick between capturing or building yourself up - especially since building up your pieces requires some amount of sacrifice. I wish I got to play this one more, I think it could compete with DVONN or YINSH.

Right behind Yinsh for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I think Tzaar has some resemblance to Yinsh and Dvonn which are the two other GIPF games I like the most along with Tzaar. I really like the victory conditions in Tzaar and how the Tzaars at first might seem like the most important pieces to protect, but if you don’t watch out you might lose the other pieces! And if you focus too much on keeping your pieces alive, you might lose to the other victory conditions because you cannot capture an opponent’s piece… This is a great balance! 

Furthermore, while the gameplay is simple, the decisions in the game are HARD to make (which is obviously the case in most of the GIPF games). The decision you have to make each turn about whether to capture two pieces (and if so, which ones) or make yourself stronger (and if so, which of your pieces) is extremely tough – which is absolutely great!

This blew me away on my first play. So many fronts - spatial, stacking, piece type - make for a very strategic game. There is no solving this one that I can tell. It is a battle for space and the definition of tempo rather than a tactical brawl or tempo footrace that most modern abstracts become. The ability to pick and choose pressure points makes the game seem more about managing imbalance than strong, two- to three- move combinations. But there are those, for sure. More plays - of this and other GIPF titles, of which I have not tried any - will tell if it has legs, but I really think it will. Really impressed.

This and Dvonn are currently my two go-to Gipf games. They are both quite different in many ways but similar in that they are fast-moving. They are also highly tactical as opposed to grand strategic games. Or, so it seems to me at this early playing stage.

RATING: 7
I played this game for the first time at Spiel 2007, and decided there and then I'd get a copy some time in the future. Fast forward to May 2008, when I noticed my FLGS carried a few unmarked pre-release editions of this game, and presto, one more title in my collection. I know, there's a newer edition coming out, with somewhat better paint jobs, but the silver worked just as fine.

TZAAR is the most addictive game of Project GIPF. Stones in three types form a unity of sorts; if one type is no longer on the board, you lose. Since the first of your two moves is required by the rules to be a hit, you also lose if you can't hit another stone. Movement is delightfully simple and combines the jumping of YINSH with the stacking of DVONN, but is devoid of the somewhat cumbersome limitation that you can only move as far as the height of your stack. There's a bit of ZÈRTZ in there too, if I remember the few games I played correctly. As a result, TZAAR is much more about setting up subtle traps and forcing the other player to make moves which cause him to lose [i]sente[/i]. However, if you think this is just dumb checkers, you have it wrong. If you hit too many other stones, you can still lose because there are no other stones left for you to hit... I have a strong hunch that a skilled player can still win in this stage. Another thing I really like about TZAAR is that a game lasts no more than 10 to 15 minutes, which is perfect for what it attempts to do. You are easily tempted to try another game, and another, and yet another... Something I've never experienced with YINSH or any other GIPF-game. 

Now for some grumbling. There isn't much strategic variety in the game no matter what people will say or write: noone ever addresses the issue that it makes perfect sense to reduce the rarest piece to even rarer levels. (It is not an issue if from 15 pieces you go to 14; it definitely is if you go from 2 to 1—ou allow yourself to be put into [i]sente[/i] in the latter case.) Therefore games invariably start with a battle for the tzaars. Whatever is left is then put into stacks so they don't get hit too easily. After that it's either chasing ever growing tzaar-stacks, or killing off the tzarras, the second commonest piece. These usually end up in stacks (albeit smaller) too, and at that point you must be very careful where you place your stones for the game is about to end for lack of other stones to hit. There is plenty of tactical maneuvring along the way, but don't confuse the depth of the game decision tree (which is hefty) with strategic options. There are very few. I fear that the lack of them will seriously hurt game replayability in the long run, even if learning the subtle dance of when to steer for what kind of victory is a complex one.

Similar to, but less intuitive than, Dvonn.  With three different types of piece, it's a bit difficult in the early game to evaluate the board at a glance, but the game ramps up into an increasingly brain-burning puzzle.

RATING: 10
Components: Sturdy, stackable pieces; just as nicely done as in the rest of the series. The three different types are easy to distinguish.

Experience: Tons of aggressive, anguishing fun. There is a quick dash to capture/secure tzaars, and then the slow battles begin, shoring up my defenses while trying to capture those final tzaars or perhaps sneakily do away with the tzaaras. Plays very quickly, and is strategic without being a brain burner.

Like DVONN, the first few moves seem a bit arbitrary, but suddenly the game snaps into place and every piece is in contention. Also like DVONN, every time a piece moves, an intersection of the board is immediately killed off, never to be revisited. So the possible moves dwindle as the game progresses. Deciding whether to capture or strengthen is nail-biting. The end condition that requires a player to capture or be defeated is a wonderful balancing mechanism that punishes the over-greedy player.

GIPF series rank: 3 of 7 (after DVONN and YINSH, but basically a three-way tie).

Yet another outstanding effort by Kris Burm, abstract game-designin' genius. I like the random setup, ensuring you truly look at a brand new board every game. Like all GIPF-series games, it plays quick. And you keep gaining new insights even after many plays. A quintessential great GIPF-series game. Replaces TAMSK to round out the Mount Rushmore of Burm's abstracts.

TZAAR is a shrinking-board elimination-based abstract game of movement, with a focus on stacking. The fundamental points of interest are the way the board changes over time, the decision to attack or stack, and the extinction-based victory condition. Taking each of these points in order:

The development of the board causes particular locations to become more difficult to access as the game goes on. In the initial stages, a given piece is likely to have a sea of opposing pieces capable of capturing it; later on in the game, the number of potential attackers is a lot smaller. Isolating a particular piece can be very valuable, as opponents can no longer threaten its extinction, but it can also hamper one's own mobility and prevent one from threatening capture.

Meanwhile, each turn a player is asked to perform an additional capture or to stack. These stacks begin to warp the board around them -they can't be threatened by smaller pieces, and are potentially very dangerous to the opponent. The first few plays I focused on one particularly large stack, but now I think there's more room in stack development. Capture of a particular large stack can provide a winning advantage, and recognizing the ability to make threats is part of the game.

Meanwhile, a player needs to keep 3 kinds of pieces all safe. A high stack can keep one type safe, but good play involves keeping all three types of your pieces safe. Keeping sets of pieces as stacks grow higher and the board changes is a challenge, and an interesting one.

It's certainly not as pure a game as Go, Hex, or Slither, but it has its own benefits to recommend it. The three central points make the game work quite well as a beautiful assembled abstract.

Yeah, I ranted and raved when I found out TAMSK was replaced.

And then it clicked:  Wait, that's yet another probably brilliant game added to the Project?

Still, some resentment remained.   I didn't want to like it.   Oh, look, the board's too much like the original, oh look, the pieces look an awfully lot like TAMSK potentials ~ I guess that answers the question of whether or not a new potential will be appearing on the scene.

As usual, real, live, actual game play slapped me upside the head and said: "It's good.   Enjoy it."

And that's where things stand now...

Played twice against adults, 6 times against 11-year old, and 4 times against 9-year old.  Handles immediate replays admirably, even between same two opponents.  Children improved with each play and beat me once each.  

If you recognize your opponent's advantage early enough, the defensive play is fun and allows creativity.  You can choose to flee and/or try to strengthen yourself, abandon yourself in unreachable position, abandon your opponent's strong stack in unmovable position, or open up previously unseen paths of escape.

Very good (and quick) game.

I'm not a huge fan of pure abstracts but as far as those go, Tzaar seems to be a very compelling game: Quick, simple, yet never trivial.

Strengthen your position but possibly give up the initiative, or sacrifice long-term potential for some quick gains in order to increase the pressure on your opponent?

Not too sure how much strategic planning you can make, although you certainty can plan a couple of steps ahead and hope for the best! Gotta keep an eye on those three types of pieces as well! Ultimately, I like ZERTZ and YINSH more, but I'd rate this one up there with DVONN.

Twenty plays. A tricky game, because you have to simultaneously think about both possible win/lose conditions. Sometimes I'll be so fixated on one element that I'll fail to notice that I'm about to lose for a completely different reason. 

My thoughts on strategy are still evolving. In the past I would just have one monster stack that would chase the other stacks around the board, but now I'm exploring the idea of having multiple stacks that can combine if threatened. My new goal is not to try to swallow up all of one of the three kinds of piece but instead to play a longer game where I try to leave the opponent with no moves. I've had a lot more success that way.

I still don't have any theories about what a good setup might be.

While I prefer Zertz in the reducing playing field genre (in that the strategy is a bit less opaque), this is a very interesting and refreshing abstract.

Having only played a few games, and losing all of them, I really like this game. It doesn't have the mind-bending constant reorienting of the playing field that YINSH has, but it does possess a similar tension in that strengthening yourself in one way also weakens you in another. There are a lot of forks and traps that can occur in the game, and you have to make sure that you threaten your opponent while constantly protecting 3 different types of pieces.

It's also kind of neat to start with a full board instead of an empty one.  (1 play)

Jun08: Quite an enjoyable abstract.  I greatly appreciate how the game has a very set turn limit.  When each space empties, it stays empty.

I also like the dual victory conditions.  They make sure you have to have a balanced approach.

I also think the 2 moves per turn makes for a very nice and volatile environment.  It's hard to consider all of the possible combinations your opponent will do next turn, so you don't get drug down into as much AP.

Overall, much better than Yinsh for me.  I think I just don't like "5 in a row" abstracts.  I also don't seem to like connection abstracts.  That just leaves me with capture, area enclosure and area control games.

Good stuff.

I like the game, but I feel like I like it for reasons that are a little too similar to why I like dvonn. The games are very similar in nature, with dvonn being a more stripped down, pure form of the primary mechanics (stacking, stack movement and capture ability based on height of stack). Perhaps if I played tzaar more often I would find myself relishing the added wrinkles to that basic game system, but for now I would probably be more inclined to just play dvonn.

RATING: 8.5
initial rating one play

Great looking game here again, can Kris do no wrong?  Combines aspects from some of the others (mostly a combo of Yinsh and Dvonn arguably the 2 best to this point) to bring you another great addition to the series.  As with my original intital rating for Dvonn, this rating is very tentative and could rise if depth and speed of play are both high.

[u]Update:[/u] Time to play is fast, depth is so so, its there but not heavy. 

Most importantly it looks like the black player has a HUGE advantage due to the white player having to sacrifice first turn and black being able to strengthen first.  This only applies if the black player chooses to strengthen and continues to do so each turn. Also, the black player does need to go after whites fewest pieces (not sure of the name) to also have this apply. When this is executed, I just don't see how white can counter but I sure hope I find a way, there must be surely but right now it becomes cat and mouse with black having the advantage and very much acting like the cat while white runs scared trying their best to hide the precious last few of the fewest piece so black doesn't devour it and win.  

This might indeed just 'be the game' but it also depends on how the players decide to play, if neither goes for the fewest it can turn out slightly different and last longer but I still very much see black with the advantage being able to strengthen first, someone does have to do it first so I sure hope I'm missing something. 

Will update after more games. 

[u]Update:[/u]  Hmmm.  Black has the advantage, no doubt about it and I really don't like playing white. Can the initial disadvantage be overcome to have a "true" game develop?  It appears it can but if white has to spend most of its time "running" its leaves him much less options and very vunerable. More games coming... Note that I did finally have one game turn into a real deathmatch type so I think this will blossom. Not enough games yet

[u]Update:[/u] 7.5 => 8.25  Okay of course there is some depth here but I'm still not convinced if Black keeps stacking white is fubared but man when white evens the field it just becomes an awesome game, if not for my hesitation this would be an easy 9 for me and fit right behind Dvonn and on par with Yinsh

[u]Update:[/u] 8.5 - Okay now at about 10 games and the black advantage is not as big as first perceived. Its there but white can scurry away and basically hide out until mobility gets more limited. Its actually pretty hard as the black or white player to pin down a stack, sometimes when a player is down to 2 stacks left of different types you can try to get a "fork" like in Chess buts its tough at any rate. 

This mobility I mentioned is really THE GAME here, if no ones wins by eliminating one type of piece watch out!!! You have to be really careful where you move pieces or you will get caught not being able to make a capture, its tricky! You can be winning and have more pieces but still lose because of your positioning, I'm finding more and more games are won or lost due to not being able to capture. Positioning and mobility are KEY! Awesome.

Played a couple of games, it's a game where there are too few moves to do all the things one wants.

The designer has made another really fine game for anyone into abstracts or just a brain burner.

RATING: 8
TZAAR is, in a way, an evolution of checkers, but to limit the description to that is a disservice. Players have 3 types of pieces in different quantities - 6, 9, and 15. You lose the game if you ever do not have all three types showing on the board. You also lose if you cannot capture an opponents piece on your turn. The board is a grid of intersections in the shape of a bagel (a bagel - because my daughter does not like donuts). On your turn, you take two actions. The first MUST be to capture. If you are not able to do this, you lose. The second move can be to capture again, or to strengthen a piece by stacking it with another. You can never capture a piece that is stronger (higher stacked) than yours. You can never break a stack, so once a piece is covered, it is off the board. So strengthening is both protective and degenerative because it removes your own pieces (see the first losing condition).

You capture pieces by moving them in a straight line over empty intersections until you hit an opponent's piece and you strengthen in the same way, just by joining with your own color rather than your opponent's. The game considerations involve denying your opponent straight lines of attack, ensuring you have multiple capture options at the start of your next turn, and choosing whether strengthening or capturing will advantage you more. The hole in the middle of the board makes the lines of attack tricky to maintain. The basic rules have you setting up the board randomly for each game. Simple rules. Lots of options on a turn. Balancing offense with defense. For an abstract game on the lighter side, this is excellent stuff.

RATING: 8
The more I play it the more I love it, even though it's harder to see the whole game than in YINSH or ZERTZ or DVONN. There are definite play styles here: you can go all aggro and try to wipe out half your opponent's Tzaaras before she even touches a counter, or you can just try to stack and gain a marginal advantage that way. I agree that there's a disadvantage to starting as White - the half-round penalty is brutal.

I think this works much better when placement is random. What would make this game a 9 or 10 would be if there was some kind of initial placement mechanic the way there is (IIRC) in DVONN.

[After first playing: This game is bone-crushingly hard. I haven't quite figured out how to make sense of it yet. Definitely not a fan of the randomness in the initial setup. Seems slightly clunkier than Yinsh; need to play again and again and again and again to figure out how to win at this...]

TZAAR is a game about making choices. Both players have 30 pieces, divided in three types: 6 Tzaars, 9 Tzarras and 15 Totts. The 3 types of pieces form a trinity: They cannot exist without each other. The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture anymore. The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: “Shall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?” Meaning: Will you capture an opponent’s piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger? If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board. On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do? Up to you to decide!

ZAAR is the fourth GIPF game I have learned. TAMSK is a special case with the hourglasses (and I like even that one), but out of the three "classic" abstract strategy games (DVONN, YINSH, TZAAR) YINSH feels most like "old-school" abstract strategy to me (it's more fun and a lot more interesting than that though) while I love the feel of DVONN (even though I can't win that one). TZAAR is closer to this DVONN feel – these are abstracts where it feels it's quite impossible to plan many steps ahead (without playing it very AP) so your play is more driven by insticts (combined with logical reasoning, of course) than anything else. Still, here you are constantly taking away your opponent’s pieces (unlike in DVONN where you are building towers but the color of the towers is really temporary) and working towards one of the aims of the game so it feels like I know what I’m doing at least… It’s a really interesting game, I want to play it often (which is going to be hard as my wife doesn’t like it that much)

With the exception of perhaps Tamsk, this is likely my favorite Burm abstract.  I am really horrendous at these straightway abstract games in that I tend to prefer to think on my feet and never look far enough head to see my doom coming.  This particular abstract brings the same effect although it will sometimes give the illusion of a victory coming nigh and then snatching it away.  To me, it is unique as well in that the first action required on everyone's turn is to capture an opponent's piece - failure to do so is immediate defeat.  The second action can be used for another attack or to build a stronger pillar of strength to take out opponents (but in building a taller pillar of strength, you are also doing your opponent a favor in burying your own pieces!).

I find the plastic pieces to be of a good quality (contrary to what some others say, I think).

Devising strategies and tactics during the first few games feels harder than with Hive.  In fact, many pieces in Hive can be used, in a given turn, while in Tzaar, we found ourselves concentrating on one, powerful big stack each: the game felt less rich, and with more limited options.  Maybe did we overlook some interesting strategies (like having multiple powerful stacks, one of each type; or thinking about how to handle the "shrinking number of paths" problem; etc.).

I do feel like we have yet to discover many subtleties, though.  The thing is that they feel harder to find than in Hive.  And Hive still feels rich enough, with lots of things yet to discover.

The setup is quite short, but is nonetheless not as nice as the immediate play of Hive.

Overall, I prefer Yinsh, which keeps me more on my toes, because of the board that slowly changes and shows fast moving tension points.  In Tzaar, the tension can come from pieces that need to be kept strong, but there are only a few of them; it also comes from the shrinking number of Tzaar and Tzaaras, but that's only 1, 2 or 3 things to keep an eye on, and that vary only slowly. Tzaar also typically ends brutally, contrary to Yinsh where points are accumulated progressively, and where they actually give a handicap. This brutality can feel random, unfortunately, as it is, at least for the first games, the result of some lucky board situation (that prevents the opponent from first capturing, or from escaping with his last piece of a kind). Tzaar has the advantage of being shorter, though (more like 15 minutes instead of 30 for Yinsh).

Simpler than Yinsh, but a nice change of pace. I love the way pieces become more powerful through stacking: the feeling of increasing power is nice.

RATING: 7.5
This game's simplicity-to-depth ratio was a big surprise, even for a 2p abstract. You start with a large number of three kinds of pieces; all of them behave the same, but you must have at least one of each at all times. During the game, you must make a capture, then you can either make another capture or build up a piece by stacking one on another. Stacked pieces can only be captured by a stack of equal or greater size. This creates significant strategic depth; do you make yourself stronger or your opponent weaker?

RATING: 9
The "replacement" for TAMSK in the GIPF project, and the second stacking game in the series. Where DVONN mystifies me and leaves me a little cold, TZAAR mystifies me while intriguing me at the same time.

I think the difference may lie in the movement. DVONN's movement rules lie in a sort of No Man's Land between the straightforward GIPF and the free-flowing later games in the series, YINSH, PÜNCT and now TZAAR. Or maybe it is how DVONN's movement rules interact with the "disappearing board" effect which bothers me. The disappearing board in DVONN means you have to find a point to move to whereas in TZAAR you get to look at entire lines. There is certainly a logic to DVONN's movement rules, but they turn me off.

As I've said, TZAAR fits more closely with YINSH and PÜNCT, While it does not have the same sweeping moves as those earlier games, it is still free enough to feel dynamic. Also, the stacking and captures give TZAAR a narrative arc and, where DVONN's arc constricts play as you go forward, TZAAR's arc is a tale of liberation and freedom of movement.

One other quick note: TZAAR's three types of pieces are both unique to the project and yet also, paradoxically, executed in a manner that screams GIPF project to me. All three types play and capture in the same manner, their only significance lies in the victory conditions. There is some reflection of the GIPF pieces in the project's ur-game in this. In fact, TZAAR seems to recycle concepts from most of the previous games more deliberately than the rest of the project, while producing its own, unique gaming experience at the same time.

This completely killed Chess and other two player abstract games for me (though I have never played Go). I've only played three times at this point, but I've loved every play. The first time, I lost by losing all of my middle pieces, the second was won by leaving my opponent with no viable moves, and the third was won by capturing all of the smaller pieces. There are just so many viable strategies and decisions to make! And I love how much adaptability is needed. I love games that don't have obvious moves, and this is definitely one of those.

[microbadge=131][microbadge=1256]

A capture heavy game, which makes the game play feel much more proactive, but also makes it a little more difficult to see a few turns ahead.  This is compounded by the fact that you are also "capturing" your own pieces, making your resources even more scarce and your planning more necessary in the face of constant changes to board position.

really dislike the colour shades on this one. the pieces aren't as easily distinguishable as one would like, especially on first glance/quicker looks. but maybe I just need new glasses, idk..
also the names of the pieces are just ridiculous. I mean come on, it could have been something less pretentious, could it not? ;)
and considering the gameplay...tzaars are the most important pieces. so it is obvious to never buff yourself on top of one of them, rather always take tzaars on top to form higher stacks of yourself. also capturing enemy tzaars is far more important than capturing the other enemy pieces, so especially the first few turns become a bit autopilot-y. if you aggressively hunt for enemy tzaars while raising your own, you will most likely win. or to phrase it a bit more provocatively: playing this strategy against someone new to the game will almost always win, hands down. so IMHO the game overall gets a bit too much praise and credit from reviewers, while there are better optics and gameplay options in the same series (see other GIPFs). but that is just my opinion. I am happy for everyone who loves this game and gets great enjoyment out of it. I personally am more lukewarm on it, pardon me.

Of the GIPF games I own (this,GIPF,YINSH), this is probably my favorite to play. The game is really straightforward to understand. This allows for a rapid gameplay that I really enjoy. That's not to say it's a simplistic game like checkers. The configuration of the board allows for chasing and 'surprise attacks' by the pieces on the board. It's really a lot of fun! I find this a very stimulating game every time I play.

07/24/08 Received. I immediately saw the family resemblance. The pieces moved sort of like Dvonn and Pünct, the board looked like Yinsh and Gipf, and the strategy/goals are like Zèrtz. A fine way to end the series. 
As of 04/24/16 I've won 13 of my 23 games.

After 47 plays: lots of variation in the way the game can play out, and several distinct strategies. The game tree is gigantic for a game of this length, and fun to contemplate. The branch factor is suitably bushy as well. If the game is sufficiently balanced for each side (not clear to me yet), it could be worthy of a tournament scene, which would be rare for a game this short. However, until you have REALLY extensive experience, the early game, and even often the mid-game, is very opaque. I've played TZAAR a bunch and I still make a fairly long sequence of random-ish moves early on (and I'm a good player compared to most - other players seem to be even more clueless early on than I am)

The game also feels "messy" compared to the abstract games I love most. The term applies both to its visual clutter and to its logic. The board is dense with information, and I have trouble seeing the distribution of my own piece-types at a glance (this information is even harder to read in online play where you don't have a third dimension to make the piece hierarchy visually clear. It's better played offline.) 

It also doesn't have the elemental, crystalline logic that my favorite abstract games have. This last point could be overruled by greater appreciation for strategy with experience. I'll continue playing, so this rating could rise.

Another issue is the game is often won or lost in the final turns on an oversight by one player, especially in games between inexperienced players. There are a lot of "gotchas" that are hard to see (again because of the busy-ness of the board), that might be frustrating for some. 

The flip side of this is that, with experience, the endgames are absolutely spectacular, with all kinds of twists and counter-twists. Among the best end-games of any game I've ever played. They're the reason I keep playing TZAAR.

An intriguing mash of Zertz and Dvonn (well, sort of). Feels a bit lighter than Yinsh and Zertz, as the two actions/turn and ability to move any piece gives a bit too much flexibility (and thus, controlled chaos). Gameplay is definitely much subtler than other games in the Gipf series, and devoid of drastic board-changing possibilities. A worthy addition to the series.

Made a very good first impression. Gets the nod over [gameid=19764] for its simplicity. Has superficial similarities to several other Gipf games - stacking as in [gameid=2346] for example, but executed differently, meaning an entirely new conundrum to unravel. 

What elevates Tzaar above almost all 2-player abstracts is its outstanding balance. Ordinarily both players start out trying to knock off the opponent's Tzaars. But then the remaining Tzaars get incorporated into large stacks which are different to capture, and so one's focus must change, with several paths available. (This is vaguely analogous to the situation in [gameid=528] where evenly-matched players often get three whites each, mutually cutting off that route to victory.) I frequently go after Tzarras, with the end result that I run out of moves, which is nasty. Maybe I need to not chase the Tzarras so much, and figure out how to take care of myself better.

RATING: 7.5
This is an entirely abstract game where players attempt to capture other the other player's pieces by moving one of their pieces onto an adjacent piece of their their opponent.  Pieces can also be stacked, making them move as a single unit and unable to be captured by pieces in a smaller stack.  The game has three different type of pieces for each player; all three move and act the same in the game, but they affect the end-game: the game ends when one player either has no legal moves, or is out of one of their types of pieces.  This is a very strategic game that requires attempting to predict moves multiple turns in advance, but movement and turn options are  limited enough that the game is easy to pick up.  This is a great game if you're looking for a thoughtful two-player game, though the players should be relatively evenly matched in reasoning and deduction skills for the game to be fun (as there is no random element at all to the game, excluding setup).

TZAAR is a game about making choices. Both players have 30 pieces, divided in three types: 6 Tzaars, 9 Tzarras and 15 Totts. The 3 types of pieces form a trinity: They cannot exist without each other. The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture anymore. The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: %u201CShall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?%u201D Meaning: Will you capture an opponent%u2019s piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger? If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board. On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do? Up to you to decide!

A Yinsh és a Dvonn mellett simán megfér a polcon (ez is GIPF projektes játék). Hasonlóan a sakkhoz, lehet intuitív is játszani, de a profiknak is nyújt elég mély taktikai/stratégiai szintet.

Háromféle korongunk van, minden lépés két mozgásból áll, először mindig ütni kell, a második lépés pedig lehet szintén ütés, de toronyépítés is. (Minél magasabb a torony, annál nehezebb leütni, mert az alacsonyabb nem tudja levenni a magasabbat.)

A játék véget ér, ha valamelyik játékosnak az egyik féle korongja elfogy vagy ha nem tud ütni.

Van nem hivatalos mobilappja is (androidra), ahol lehet gyakorolni, de túl nagy elvárásunk ne legyen: még legkönnyebb fokozaton is laposra fog verni az AI, ha még kezdők vagyunk.

Zseniális, imádom.

Tzaar is good, probably one of the best games in the GIPF series. The rules are easy to teach and intuitive and the game play is also easy - at least on the surface. Things get interesting as the pieces are removed. Well done, a really good abstract.

Another great game in the GIPF series. It might be the most accessible, variable, and interesting game of the entire series. It's easily the most flamboyant and tricky, with a fine hide and seek element. It almost feels like an elaborate capture the flag. Yet there are so many paths to victory and so many approaches to playing it well.

Another lunchtime abstract, another winner. This member of the famous GIPF series plays very well and is a lot of fun. Again, it offers challenging decisions and has some really good gameplay. The components are top-notch, but the board itself is could have done with just a little 'jazzing up'.

Our exploration of this game is at the early stages, but already we’re discovering a range of different strategies and counter-strategies which can really push a player and offer challenging decision making.
Well worth a look. One I’ll consider for purchase and would not normally refuse an offer to play.

RATING: N/A
You make 2 moves: 1st- capture a piece; 2nd either capture again or jump on one of your pieces to make a stack bigger.

Game ends when someone cannot capture an opponent's piece or if they lose all of one of the 3 types of pieces.

Would play, but probably not buy.

This was just meh. After playing YINSH, I thought I might have found a series of abstracts I could sink my teeth into. TZAAR isn't a bad game, per se, but it feels like a distant cousin of Checkers, which I'm not a fan of at all. I can see how repeated play could up the strategy and tensity for its players, but I'm not interested in doing so. Abstracts aren't really my thing, and this didn't do much to change my mind on that subject. Also, why are the sides of the pieces different? It makes it really confusing telling each piece apart.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Initially I was unimpressed with this, but, after a few plays, it began to reveal its depths.  It remains fairly quick as a game, but if an encounter goes on long enough it becomes a genuine nail-biter.

There are enough different things to have to think about to keep the game interesting, and it has a strong feel of being always one move too short.

I have to add that this is a great game for non-gamers to get into as well.  The rules are simplicity itself, but after that it gets quite involved.

The special pre-release edition, #64/1000.

So far, it seems like there is less emphasis on the spatial thinking and more emphasis on the psychological side. Or, maybe, the spatial dynamics between pieces are buried too deep for me to easily recognise. While playing other games in the GIPF project, I often feel like there usually are only a few promising moves on the board and I have to try hard to identify them. With TZAAR, (seemingly) equally good moves abound on the board so I tend to rely on intuitive sense of balance. Overall it feels very different from other games in the series, which is not a bad thing at all!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My preferred game of the project GIPF.

New strategies are discovered with more playing: there are layers and layers of strategies that are discovered with more experience, and the new strategies become "bricks" on which you can build new ones. 

Some strategies can be explained, some are subtle, belonging more to intuition than reasoning.

There are no fixed patterns in the game, any game is completely different from the other.

It is incredible that all this is packed in a game that usually lasts less than 15 minutes.

If you like abstracts (but even if you don't like them) you should try this. It is the masterpiece of Mr. Burm, IMHO.

UPDATE 5th November 2011
I lowered a bit the rating of this game, since any time  I want to play an abstract game at this moment I play Go. It is still a very good game if you want to play an abstract game other than Go.

RATING: 10
Tzaar shows qualities and ingredients already familiar to Gipf project fans (short, dynamic, sporting stacking and capturing as in Dvonn and offering different routes to victory as Zèrtz), but there are two new features: players have got two moves, out of which the first one is a forced capture, and instead of isolated pieces being removed, they stay on the board and move straight to the next piece or stack in that direction (as in Claude Soucie's Watch).

The result is an extremely aggressive game - players have got to strike relentlessly and at the same time stack up their pieces to defend and attack more powerfully. Removing the inner pieces brings a quicker win, so that attacks normally happen from the middle of the board towards the edges, and the range of the moves grows towards the end of the game at the same speed at which single pieces become more difficult to protect.

Despite the fact that it might initially raise some eyebrows for filling the gap previously occupied by the quirkiest Gipf game there ever was, and also for being playable with a Gipf set and some potentials, Tzaar is not only worth the try - if you add up clarity, depth and intensity it surpasses almost every other game in the series.

I believe Tzarr could be the best of the series in terms of replayability. Let me explain. No, there is too much. Let me sum up.

It takes some of the best of its predecessors and combines them well. I wouldn't recommend it to players who didn't like non-abstracts. But I think it's appealing to waverers because the early play is so quick and the end-game provides some delicious decision making. The best of both worlds, in 20 minutes. Others in the series might offer deeper, broader and more meaningful decision trees, but they also take longer with more downtime. And the shorter ones provide too much advantage to those who've played before. Tzarr seems to strike the best balance.

Tzaar is an abstract game, much like the other five games in the Gipf series. The goal in this one is to eat your opponent’s pieces and stack you pieces so that they cannot be eaten by your opponent or so that they can eat your opponent’s larger pieces. You have three different types of pieces, they all do the same thing, but if you run out of any one, you lose, so you must ensure to continually have at least one of each. May not be the best in the series, but still fun to play.

A very nasty 2 player abstract. One bad move can easily lead to an immediate loss once you reach about the midpoint of the game.  The confrontation begins as soon as the gate opens.

I always have reservations about new GIPF games, as I am always skeptical that they can live up to the standard set by the already-existant GIPF games.  That said, I've almost never been disappointed, and TZAAR may well be my favorite GIPF of all.  The rules are simple, gameplay is elegant, and there is the incredible depth of tactics that make the GIPF games so amazing.  Thanks to the stacking pieces and the movement/shrinking board dynamic, I feel that this game has greater strategic depth than most of the other GIPF games.  This is in my top 3 of the GIPF series, and further plays may well place it at #1.

As to be expected an interesting but themeless exercise of outwitting your opponent whereby you either capture all of 1 of 3 types of opposing piece from the board or your opponent can't make a legal move. First move must be a capture: the second is to stack, which not only makes it harder to capture but can also defend vulnerable pieces in line of sight, but also stacking reduces your strength. I can see the appeal but there is no level playing field for different player strengths, so relying on equal footing for a tense "fight" or your opponent being unable to "read" what you are up to.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Liked it after my first play, fell in love with it after my second. Presents very interesting and tantalizing choices with each move. The trade-off between promotion or capture is brilliant and keeps you always thinking that there was something better you could have done.

I definitely prefer it to YINSH since the lookahead is more intuitive to me. With YINSH I have difficulty predicting how the board state will look even two turns ahead. Maybe this will alleviate as I get better at YINSH, but then again I'm not itching to want to play it enough to get better in the first place!

Players must balance capturing their opponent's pieces against reinforcing their own pieces, all the while trying to  maintain the ability to move and capture the following turn. As the game progresses, the board begins to dwindle and the difficult decisions start to develop creating an amazing game experience. The game time is

Even though it is a shame that TAMSK is no longer considered part of the GIPF series, TZAAR is an superb replacement.

GIPF-y abstract.

RATING: 7
I'd describe it as "complicated checkers."  That isn't really an indictment or criticism...it just sums the game experience up pretty nicely.  It's cool, you can probably play it with younger kids, but for two adults, it is one of a bazillion available abstract strategy games; albeit one that wears out its welcome after a dozen plays or so.  
Great components, though.

RATING: 9.5
Several plays later this is still a well deserved 8. Haven't played it enough to qualify with DVONN Or YINSH but the depth is starting to shine. Looking forward to learning the strategies. 

UPDATE: we're starting to see the board better and the move possibilites. Bumped up the rating to a 9 as the game keeps getting better. This may be equal to Yinsh and Dvonn eventually.

Update 2: Wow its getting really close to YINSH in depth. Bumped it again to 9.5 (relative to YINSH) It forces me to drop DVONN because it's in third place now compared to the other two.

Great abstract logical game from GIPF. The pieces are just phenomenal, providing this beautiful look, tactile feel and "click". Rules are simple, games are quick. I like it very much that there are 2 win conditions, so you have to stretch yourself thin and guard both. I also like the concept of compressing board, as it introduces a nice strategy element. 

My go to game, for a logical challenge match.

It's a perfect information, pure abstract game which just reinforces why I have a hard time warming up to them.  One just has to analyze the decision tree and then make a move, and I don't really find great joy in doing that too often.  I prefer games to be more social, with interaction, and chit-chat.  Hard to do here when folks are thinking while playing.

Played a lot in Essen 2007, and bought it.  My first reaction is that it's my new favorite of the Gipf project, and many plays later, that's still true.

I like pure strategy games with a random setup, which Tzaar has.  (There are 2 variants included for people who hate random setup.)

It seems to have a higher variety of qualitatively different possible higher level strategies than the other Gipf games.  I have played in games ending by each of the various possible victory conditions (opponent runs out of any of the 3 kinds of pieces, or can't move).

Some people dis the Essen prototype for looking bland, but I actually like the board a lot.

The more I play it, the more I love it. So fast, so brutal, every move is important for your continued survival and eventual victory, and it could all be over with a single mistake. Having to make sure you have at least one of three different pieces on the board is such a challenge and it's easy to overlook a color, but that's part of what makes the game so dynamic. This and Yinsh are my favorite Gipf games so far.

Quickly raised among my favourite GIPF-project games. At the moment, second only to Dvonn. And this trend still doesn't fade after repeated plays.

I understand why Mr. Burm wanted this game to be a part of the GIPF project. Although it does really have a feeling of his own, there are several links to other GIPF project games : Dvonn in the set up, piles and shrinking board, Zertz in the three different types of pieces, Pünct in the need to take time to climb to the heights... Tamsk is a nice game, but it lacked just that.

1 game, couple of solos.

Too early to judge, but an interesting game indeed. And I don't like abstracts a lot. The way the space changes around stacks is really fascinating. it needs the right kind of  players and my GF isn't one of them (too much thinking and not theme or talking is not for her). I'll have to play this again with more appropriate players. But definitely an interesting abstract. 

3 more plays. Fascinating. As I play I'm more fascinated by the way the space is shaped than by trying to find how to win. (I still did win).

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I haven't really played enough games (around 100?) to be able to make any assertions about depth or long term strategy... but it feels less strategic than chess to me. Play seems mostly tactical, with a few strategic rules of thumb (almost always stack; maintain mobility for your large stacks; isolate singlets of a specific type, if you can, to ensure that type's survival; maximize ZoC). I tend to play pretty fast until late-middle game, when I can start calculating.

Michelle refuses to play this with me (naturally), so I started by playing against hstzaar. Sadly, I outgrew it fairly quickly--even the insanely slow pscout ply 6. Waltz is a much better and much much faster AI than hstzaar, but it doesn't have a useful interface. I'm trying to use hstzaar as a frontend for waltz, but that's been difficult since I'm not a programmer. It doesn't help that haskell is really strange.

This is a very good abstract.  In general these kinds of positional abstracts leave me a little cold, and this is no exception.  That said, it is quite good for what it is.  In my limited playing of the series (all but Gipf, Zertz and Tamsk) I found this to come a close second behind Yinsh.  There are a number of really compelling things going on here, and you certainly have to split strategies and your method of play in order to win, so I can see a fan of the abstract game really coming back to the well here.

Good abstract with lots of interesting choices. In order to defend yourself and plan ahead, you have to forego capturing your opponent's pieces and sacrifice some of your own.

Wonderful game in the Gipf-series. It shares the shrinking play area with Dvonn and Zertz, a concept I really like. Together with the compulsary forst move of taking an enemy piece, this creates a lot of tension. This may turn out to be my favourite in the series.

The 7th GIPF game, replacing weird real-time (and in the wrong-sized box!) TAMSK. Each player has three different kinds of piece, and loses if the last of any one is captured. Pieces can also be stacked for safety (stacks can only be captured by stacks of equal or greater height), which leads to the second loss condition: being unable to make a compulsory capture with the first of your two actions.

There's a nice arc to this one, as with most of the GIPF series -- the target-rich early game has quite a different feel to the large stacks striding like giants around the late game's depopulated wasteland.

It hasn't quite "clicked" for me the way that YINSH, ZÈRTZ etc. did, but a very worthy entrant. Now to replace PÜNCT. ;)

One of the better Project GIPF games that I've played.  I didn't like it as much as YINSH, but probably as much as DVONN, and more than PUNCT and ZERTZ.  TZAAR seems a bit easier to wrap your head around than some of the other GIPF games, although would most definitely take many plays to really get a good handle for.  As with all of them, it has exceedingly simple rules, yet is another very deep abstract game, which you could either play quickly and light-heartedly or very slowly with a lot of thought.  Nice components as always with this series, and another one I'm contemplating buying.  If my other GIPF games were getting to the table more lately then I'd definitely pick this one up and add it to my collection.

Simple rules, intense game, great components. What more can you expect from an abstract game? Probably the best in the series. Another bonus: It plays under 20 minutes!!!

I think I can use this as a filler - seems quick, easy to explain and was enjoyable

Throw Checkers and Chinese Checkers in a salad spinner and this is the result?

Really - I know that sounds dumb but this is a worthy abstract when you need a quick fix - especially with some new people 

Like it better then Yinsh so far

While this plays quickly for a GIPF game, this has no absence of tough decisions, tricky plays, and involved look-ahead. Managing keeping all of your ring types in play while still being on the attack takes some strong foresight.

I like all the GIPF games, this one has quickly jumped to 2nd favorite, only 2nd to Zertz. I like the 2 ways to win! Also interesting is the different availability of the three different piece types.  You have to remain so allert and attentive so as not to miss an opportunity your opponent has. Really fun. My order of favorites in the GIPF series are:

ZERTZ
TZAAR
DVONN
PUNCT
GIPF
YINSH
TAMSK (taken out of GIPF series replaced by TZAAR.)

Definitely not my cup of tea. Others in the GIPF series are much better. Yinsh and Dvonn remains my favorite. I don't think that this game brings anything new or interesting to the table.

Добротная абстрактно-стратегическая игра.
...Поиграл еще и прибавил рейтинг с 7/10 до 9/10. Интересны бывают концовки. Случается, что имеешь инициативу, высокие, трудноубиваемые стеки по всем типам фишек, а проигрываешь, т.к. не можешь сделать обязательное взятие в свой ход. Такие повороты дорогого стоят. При этом игра динамичнее, чем DVONN.
...Рейтинг движется все выше. Давал 9,2; 9,7. Теперь 9,9.
...Ну ладно, полноценные 10/10.

TZAAR is dynamic, fun, interesting, easy to explain and learn. Stylistically, it combines aspects of the other games in the GIPF series. Unlike some abstracts, the learning curve is smooth and rewarding in this one.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
TZAAR is a game about making choices. Both players have 30 pieces, divided in three types: 6 Tzaars, 9 Tzarras and 15 Totts. The 3 types of pieces form a trinity: They cannot exist without each other. The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture anymore. The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: “Shall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?” Meaning: Will you capture an opponent’s piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger? If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board. On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do? Up to you to decide!T ZAAR is the most recent game in project GIPF, replacing TAMSK which was felt to not quite fit in with the others due to its use of sand timers.

I am terrible at this one...I get destroyed by my wife. For some reason I always miss the cases where she can capture twice. Still fun though, I love to get this to the table. Even if it means the game will end in tears...from me :)

Simplest rules of the entire series, clear and uncluttered.  Pieces are consistent with rest of series, contrary to some remarks here (unless the paint starts to flake or something).

I'm not yet seeing that stroke of genius I've come to expect from Burm.  I suspect that with skill, all three second move options will come into play, and that will take it to the next level.

I'm going to go out on a limb and state that this is the BEST game of the gipf series (I've played ALL but TAMSK). I believe Kris Burm has honed these abstract games to a very fine art and Tzaar is quite simply a game of pure genious. Having only owned this game about a month, I've clocked up 26 games of it. For sheer depth to play time ratio, tzaar is a winner in my book.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Played once. As much as such a game can be judged after only one play, this game seems to be one of the easiest and shortest in the Gipf project - which might be because of the "shrinking board" it shares with Dvonn (once emptied, a space cannot become full again). Of course, it isn't entirely obvious either. The different pieces types for each player might make the game less elegant than the other ones in the series. I would definitely like to play it again.

My second-favourite abstract. It's light and simple, and while the decision space starts large, it shrinks over time. When decisions really start mattering, it's pretty easy to look ahead and see the consequences of your actions.

Tzaar is also really evocative. The towers getting higher and more capable of crushing its opposition is really easy to understand and fun. It can also be pretty scary. The balance of trying to protect all your pieces is really tricky as well.

It does have a pretty big advantage to second player though.

While I don't feel the need to collect all the GIPF games I rather like DVONN and YINSH and based on reviews I trust I think I'd really like TZAAR as well.  So I threw a reasonable bid at an auction and it stuck... so I now have a copy!  I don't know when I'll actually get it on the table but it looks nice next to the others on the shelf regardless :laugh:

Hmmmm.  Very quick to play since the mechanisms act as an integral timer.  Gipf is, of course, my favorite, but I'd definitely rate this above Dvonn, Zertz and maybe Yinsh (Tamsk is too unlike the rest and I've never played Punct).  As a 15-30 minute abstract, it's going to be tough to beat.

Why am I so fond of this game? Is it the cute little amoebae? Is it the fun artwork of the cards? Is it the simple but great mechanics that tie in so well with the theme? Is it the endless opportunities for poop jokes? I'll never know...

Unusual game where the genes provide some definate strategic paths (in the same way that some Puerto Rico buildings compliment each other). Just a little too long and chaotic for me to want to play it too often though.

I liked this game when we played it at Gaspcon '07.  I really liked how the different genes make your tribe unique, and the whole board worked out surprisingly well.  The end of the game sort of just happened--that was a bit of a let down.  Also, and maybe I'm alone on this, but it seems like there's an entire game just in the different genes you could get, and that could be expanded and endlessly fun.  About 10 people walked by and said "oh, you're playing the poop game".

130929 Maybe it was the play group.  Oh well this remains one of my gaming disappointments.  I'll try it again if someone offers, but really its enduring memory at this time is too long for what it is.

100531 I think it can be a very good game, but only if you have a group of concentrated players.  Our group was slightly distracted and the game does not run very smoothly.  Its a little complicated to explain but once you pick it up it moves along.  We made the mistake of letting a guy have a key card that really tied up all his movements nicely...and pretty much gave him the game.  I will play, but only with "serious" gamers.  It does feel a bit long, I wonder if there are good variants to shorten it.  It is definitely a fun theme that works well but a hell of a lot heavier than the artwork would make you think!

Such a fun game. Players control teams of amoebas that slosh back and forth in a primordial tidal pool.

Players try, through maneuver and conflict to maximize their populations. They also attempt to maintain a variety genetic advancements.

The game is very hard on the weak. A mistake made early in the game can take you out of the running.

My family *LOVES* this game. They only refer to it as the "Amoeba Poop" game, and chuckle constantly when we play it. I like it because the genes make things flexible. There's usually a nice period of non-direct-aggression, but then someone takes some offensive genes and the whole tone of the game shifts.

There are a TON of fiddly bits in the game, so it can definitely help to have someone act as a "food banker" of sorts managing the food supply upkeep. But as long as someone is doing that it plays pretty fast, and is good, loose, social fun.

This is one of those highly praised games and that's why I sought it out, but for me, it felt and played like a game design from a middle school science fair project. Everyone who played with me had the same impression: way too long, too complicated to resolve, too fiddly, boorish, and in general, just like the name of the game: it's primordial soup. But this one has no life in it at all - not a smile, just a smell.

Ursuppe, sopa de amebas! Un juego que no se parece a ningún otro. Muy original. Las reglas básicas se ven cambiadas por la adquisición de genes. Tiene el inconveniente del Análisis Parálisis que las cartas de genes pueden generar a la hora de comprarlas. Nada que no se pueda superar, pero el juego en general se hace un poco largo. Muy recomendable la expansión Freshly Spiced, añade y amplia las cartas de genes (además de añadir 5º y 6º jugador)

RATING: 5
A fun game of pooping and eating poop.  (It's true!)  Definitely some strategy.  Two downsides: (1) Newer players choosing genes to buy.  Time delays for purchasing genes as they figure out which they want and which do what.  (2) The repetitive nature of the game.  Go through steps 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.  Score.  Repeat.  Try it out if you get the chance, but in my opinion not a must.

RATING: 2
Ugh.  I don’t care for this one at all.  True, I only played one game, but you’d be hard pressed to get me to sit down to another.  Talk about tedious.  Half of the time you spend either picking up and sorting the “food stuff” cubes or laying down the same (i.e., excretions).  The other half of the time you spend wondering what the hell you can do with the gene pool to make some sort of difference.  The victory point track felt like a bad slow-motion dream with all of us crawling along, maintaining the same distance from each other.  
     Strangely enough, the ugly grey board didn’t bother me.  I thought it was helpful in the sense that the foodstuff cubes that we were perpetually laying down and picking up stood out quite clearly.  I liked the variety of the different genes and thought they would give us all a chance to be real creative in our strategies.  However, they seemed to have little impact on our lethargic meandering along the victory track. 
     The ideas behind the game seem sound, but the implementation leaves a lot lacking, at least for this gamer.  I won’t call it a bad game, but what I will call is perhaps worse:  Boring.  Way too fiddly.

Maybe my biggest disappointment in eurogames. I heard for the first time about this game many years ago, well before I started to collect boardgames. I instantly felt attracted by the theme (you can try to guess my occupation). Finally, I bought the german version, played a couple of times and I did not like it. It is repetitive, fiddly and boring (for me). Probably the worst aspect of the game is the scoring, I felt that most of what you try to do in the game does not matter at the end. It is very difficult to advance your position. Just not rewarding enough.

RATING: 6.9
A very fun game with a whacky theme: You are a race of prehistoric multicellular organisms that start out only able to float around with the current of the ocean and trying to grab food.  As you eat cubes of all different colors, you poop out cubes of your own color (which you cannot eat, but others can!).  As you gain strength, you can asexually multiply, and even cause a mutation of your choice, which will help all of your units, giving them many abilities including the ability to swim upstream of the current, to fight other organisms, and to survive while eating less food.

By the end of the game you will have seen many strategies unfold, and the pro's and cons of each, and have the urge to play again try out something completely different!

Once you get past the heavy game flow (the parts of a round are confusing to new players), the game itself has lots of cool aspects to it.  The randomness in the game is there to get you into trouble, and it's your job to figure out how to get out.  Strategies are all over, from being agressive to helping out other players for your own self interests.  I'm off to get the add on!

Not much seems to change on the score track - as long as you maintain rough parity in amoebas and gene cards with your opponents, the relative positions among players are pretty well maintained throughout the game.  Bottom line - those who are ahead will stay ahead, and those behind will stay behind.  The rest of the game boils down to fiddly mechanics that don't count for much, as long as you can keep your amoebas alive (that, and lots of downtime while you wait for your opponents to complete their fiddly mechanics).

I've played Primordial Soup a couple of times and have really enjoyed each experience.  I love how many different strategies there are, and that most of them seem pretty viable.  I don't like the abundance of cubes very much, but otherwise the components are pretty good and the theme is hilarious (thanks to the flavor text).

Unfortunately, there's a couple of things that I think hurt this game.  First, there's enough pieces on the board where management can become difficult.  It's pretty easy to bump the table or the board and have some of the cubes end up in places where they aren't supposed to be.  Secondly, the process of each turn can be difficult to remember for the uninitiated.  Sometimes things are done in descending order; sometimes things are done in ascending order; usually you have to spend BPs that you just got.  It's difficult to remember all the intricacies, even for a veteran.  That said, the player aids are pretty helpful once you understand the process.  Finally, the game suffers from only being playable with 3 or 4 people.  I don't know why, but for some reason I almost never have that number in my group.  If it allowed for different amounts of players, we might play it more often.

RATING: 8
Rating based on just one play.  

This has a great theme and unique game play.  The evolution powers are well-designed and can combine together in lots of different ways.  As players collect different evolutions their playing style changes so that everyone is trying to do things a little differently.  

A common complaint is that the game is too long, but it didn't bug me on my first play.  There's a lot of administrative work that needs to be done during the game, so it's important to get everyone involved.

the board initially looks too boring, but i think it does a great job of making the pieces pop.  fun game.  the gene combinations seem to be the whole value though, and i'm not sure how much replay it has as a result of it.  the non-gene parts of it also stretch the game out too long.  i'd still play it again.

Game theme is creative and the components nicely made.  These aside, the actual game play is pretty good, but not great.  Much of the game works very well.  It is possible to really get a feeling of being stuck and that can drag down the game.  Also, with more players (5-6 with expansion), the down time can really start to be a factor.  Perhaps better approached with a lighter intent than the game can deliver.

Initial Impressions: Feb 23-2008
The game is a very well disguised multiplayer wargame.  However, I did quite enjoy it more than I thought it would.  I am looking forward to playing the game with the expansion genes.  My only concern at the moment is getting hit early by Struggle for Survival will make it very hard to make a come back, if not impossible.  It was a pretty cool game that depending on what genes you get gives you really cool advantages.  It was very thematic.  Maybe almost too thematic as I do not like the Parasitic gene at all.  I think it doesn't add anything to the game play.  The game certainly deserves more exploring.

The game is certainly original.  It is about amoebas... Components are fantastic, although the board itself is maybe too monochromatic and with a "sad" colour.  Anyway, after a while it will be filled with cubes and amoebas, being really colourful.
The game flows quite fast once you get the point, and the different possibilities given by genes are enormous.  You may use really a lot of very different estrategies.
It is long, but you don't feel it is sooo heavy, so don't be afraid.

Very good game of eating other players excrement..yes really thats the game. Your little ameobas live on other ameoba droppings. By carefully managing your ameobas and your "energy" you breed, evolve new powers, eat, eat each other, and sometimes die. Points are scored for numbers of ameobas and numbers of mutations at end of each round. Game ends after first person scores over 42 points. Winner is one with most points at final scoring.

I enjoyed my first play but I do not like the scoring system of jumping over occupied spaces, seems unthematic, artificial, and unnecessary. What's wrong with simply using available funds as tie breakers? When it comes to evolutionary games, not sure if I prefer this over Evo. They both seem to drag on a little too long, Evo is less cluttered and has an auction, but PS seems to require more analytical power.

The upgrade cards are fun and so is the eating/pooping mechanism. The game itself, meh. In the end, whoever had the most amoebas out for the longest time wins. Once you lost 2 amoebas because you couldn't leave an exhausted zone (no appropriate upgrades) or someone ate them you have no chance to catch up again.

Strange one this. Strategies didn't leap out at me after one play and the flow seemed very stecatto at times. There is a chunk of chance with the card draw to establish drift (adjusted by the cards I know) and there just seemed too many oportunities for significant moves to be decided by the roll of a die. If you start to lag the leaders there seems few or no oportunities to catch up. Our 2 hour game seemed to last alot longer. Didn't grab me and I wouldn't rush for a second game.

RedInToothAndClaw, MultiOnly

When I was younger, I used to be fascinated by artificial life programs---the kind that simulate little organisms feeding, breeding, hunting, etc. on landscapes made up of food cubes/ferns/sugar/whatever.  The code for organism behavior was usually fairly simple, and the most fun programs used "genetic" combination of the levels of creatures that "bred" so that you got strange evolved behaviors.  Ursuppe is like that, only much more fun because this time you're the species trying to survive, and you have control over which genes you can use (and there's a lot more variety in Ursuppe's genes than in those old programs).  Ursuppe is tons of fun, and probably very educational, but mostly it's fun.  Beautiful presentation, too.

I need to play this one more in order to get a better feeling for it. I had fun playing, but I felt like I was doing things a little randomly at times.

I like the game a lot, but it is very mcuh about the mechanic and not much about the creatures. We like to play with the "house agreement" of keeping less creatures and getting more gene cards. Keeps things moving faster...

A very unique gaming experience. Even though I *always* find myself referring to the rules summary while playing (I just can't remember the order of stages), and AP-prone players can kill this game dead, it's just fascinating to try different gene combinations and see how things play out. The expansion is a mixed bag.

...update...

After 4 plays, I'm starting to feel this drags on too long for the payoff. I admire a lot of the mechanisms here, but it just drags too much while people are deciding where to move and spawn, or what genes to buy.

Great game, maybe starting to show its age slightly but, none the less, lots of fun, several strategies and some great genes which gave additional powers without unbalancing the game as a whole. In fact, very nicely balanced is probably a good way to describe this one.

A highly confrontational Euro game where everyone is muttering about poo.  Best when everyone is familiar with the rules as the selection of genes can lead to massive downtime.  I love the theme, but I wish the board wasn't so drab.  This game is an ancient relic in boardgame years but I've found it to be interesting and different enough to continue to hold on to it.

I did not like this after my first playing.  Neither the game or the theme engaged me whatsoever.  It felt like a big cube swap with nastiness.  I like nastiness in games, but I guess because I wasn't digging the theme, it seemed pointless.

RATING: 5
I really desire to give this game a higher score.  Primordial Soup contains a strong marriage of theme and gameplay for a German game and is one of the few to plunge into special powers.  Adapting to the various genes and concocting your own spectacular combos is immense fun.  However, the game long overstays its welcome, clocking in at over an hour and a half with the full complement.  Recommended for at least one play.

Theme-rich Euro about the evolution of ameobas. Unique mechanics almost defy description, but essentially, folks swim in the "soup" eating and excreting and mutating. The ameoba species which is most adept at mutating, reproducing, and surviving should emerge victorious. Since it only seats four, I'm on the lookout for the 5-6 player expansion.

Looks like a silly game at first, but it's like they say, it's all fun and games until the first amoeba dies... Then it's a fight against starvation, stealing other people's food, eating them entirely, a bloody (or would be, if amoeba had blood)free-for all. The scoring is really tight (specially with the leapfrogging rule), so every move (and specially every mistake) counts. Good times.

[after selling it] Probably my favorite "previously owned" game, but a guy in my group enjoyed it much more than I did and the game is not frequent enough to justify both of us owning it, so I sold him my copy.

I wanted to like this evolution-themed game, but it's just okay in my book.  Attacking is very important, primarily as a source of food.  The board always feels too small... bumping into walls instead of moving somewhere is very annoying.  I guess the board needs to be small for player interaction, but the movement card deck didn't have to be right in the middle of the board as an obstacle.  ** I'm warming up to the game again and realizing the importance of the movement-related genes and saving BPs for movement.  *** Recently played the random genes variant, and it works well to speed up the game for slow players; also, it is a suitable handicap for veteran players when playing with newbies.

Evolutionary game where your peices eat and crap, hopefully they get the chance to evolve and reproduce before they starve!

I was expecting to like this one - but was disappointly underwhelmed. It felt rather repetative, each turn was very similar to the previous one with no real development other than the advanced gene cards (which are rather crucial).

Bit fiddly, downtime with 4, and just wasn't as much fun as I was expecting.

Cada jugador controla una serie de amebas.. que flotan a la deriva en una sopa, y se mueven controladas por una carta que indica hacia donde se van en cada turno. Cada vez que tienen que comer, necesitan un cubo de cada color, excepto el propio... y cagan dos cubos del propio color. Es decir, todas comen lo que otras cagan. Además, en cada turno el jugador puede decidir gastarse sus PB (Puntos biológicos) en conseguir cartas de genes, que aportan capacidades a las amebas. Hay cobos muy interesantes.

El tablero es muy colorido, y los combos y posibilidades inbteresantes. La partida se acaba cuando alguien llega o sobrepasa los 40 puntos. Muy recomendable.

A game filled with interesting choices and plenty of tension. Players try to optimise their species of amoeba by evolving them and trailing each other around the board in the hope of keeping well fed. The evolution cards also mean that player options, choices and tactics evolve as well, some players will be able to excel in particular conditions and other players in other conditions, this makes for a varied and fascinating game. The game is long, but engaging and interesting the whole time. There are plenty of opportunities to mess with other players, so this is not a game for people who like to always play nicely. So much for euros being all multi-player solitare!

Primordial Soup is a 3 or 4 player game, but the theme was so unique and the box art really captivated my fiance, so we bought it anyway.  We tried two different two player variants: one has us each controlling two colors independently, the other has an artificial third player.  We definitely prefer the artificial AI, even though I normally reject such things out of hand - futzing with an invisible third party and doing die rolls and the like I find very uninspiring.  However, the AI variant on the 'geek doesn't require overmuch thought, and the idea of an AI player really works ok with this theme anyway.  The AI player is often quite competitive!  I'd recommend this game even for two, as the biological aspects that is simulates are very interesting and it is what I wanted all those old "life-sim" PC games to be but definitely weren't.  The bits are really cool in a retro, abstract way too.

Playing this again recently was not as pleasing an experience as I had hoped. It was a touch long, had a serious runaway leader problems, and the genes are not well-balanced or well-priced. This is a game that has wonderful elements, and which I would like to like more, but the fact of the matter is it just doesn't quite work. When it came out in 1997, I thought it was a very nice game which wasn't quite there, but which succeeded nontheless. Now, 10 years later, with so many more great games available, that doesn't cut as much ice.

The 5-6 player expansion has some issues; while some of the genes it adds are cool, the game becomes a little long and the balance is definately very different.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This one was a pretty big disappointment to me.  The mechanics were really cool, but the cards seemed to dominate play, drowning the cool mechanics in a cesspool of amoeba crap.  The card that allows a player to buy new amoebas for 4 instead of 6 seemed like it could be broken.  It also appeared that once a player gets behind, he has no hope of catching up and will just continue to plod along in last place.  Overall, a promising game that just fell flat.

Preliminary rating based on 1 play. Good strategy game that actually suited the theme quite well (though the bits kind of sucked, especially after seeing those gorgeous hand made clay ones).

Maybe it gets better with more plays?

I actually like the accordion effect in scoring which brings long range strategies back into the game to compete with those who scored many points in the first few rounds.  I also appreciate how there is a plan of action for each player that must be addressed by the rest of the table.  It feels cyclical in the way one player's amoebas are more successful when compared to one other player but suffer compared to another.  Kinda like life, huh?

RATING: 5
Interesting game. Innovative mechanics. The board play is interesting, but I wonder if it is so chaotic that planning is impossible. Would be much better if there were more branches on the gene-trees to give a better feel of evolving a particular trait. Some gene combos are more powerful than others; I think it just seems well balanced. Why they chose hand limits I do not know. It just adds an unnecessary luck factor.  I think Evo is better.

I think Primordial Soup feels different game than many other eurogames. It might be because it’s so old and hasn’t bought game mechanics from newer games. In any case, I liked how PS plays out. 
I liked how the turn order really means something, I liked how the game doesn’t end after a certain amount of rounds but when somebody gets more than (50 I think, maybe it’s 40 or so) points and I liked the huge amount of very different cards and how they’re limited so each player ends up getting very different special powers. I also liked how there is room for clever play as you can try to make your own amoebas die in places where your other amoebas are in order to feed that one; this requires skills and I must admit that I wasn’t particularly good at it in my first game…

The wind direction cards and the roll of the die certainly both add an element of luck, but I think it’s necessary for the game to shine that everything cannot be calculated. It does suck when you roll poorly, but then you might consider an evolution card to get an extra reroll or extra move or something like that.

After the game I was told that there is a somewhat dominating strategy to follow; you need to get the “Move”/”Speed” cards or some of those which give you a lot of options and a card which lets you replace a certain color poo with another poo. I have only played once so I cannot entirely confirm this, but the player who had played before did follow this strategy and won (although not by much; I was a close second, but compared to number 3 and 4 in our game, I also took a movement card in the beginning…)

Primordial Soup is an old euro game but it was a pleasant surprise to see that it has aged well. I was a bit disappointed to hear about the apparently dominating strategy, but I will give PS a second try or even two more before I can say whether it is true or not (after all, it might just be a general consensus in that playing group and not in general). However, if it is, I don’t see myself playing it a whole lot afterwards, but if it isn’t I suspect I can get a handful of plays out of this game. It certainly feels different than many other euro games.

Great theme and eating poop is fun, but still - there is something lacking from this one that makes it a winner.  I think its the 10 free BPs you get - or how all the gene cards are available to everyone.  It suffers from not having an endgame to build for as well, especially mixed with special powers that can be had.  Its basically just a points race, with no real way to trip up the other players.

This is one of those games that came out more or less contemporaneously when I first got into German games...I always wanted it, I was intrigued by its arcanity, the amoeba theme...now, years later, I've finally played it and it didn't disappoint.  It's really a very easy to learn game once you get a feel for what the genes can do.  The chief problem for me is that it can drag on too long due to leaderbashing.  I feel like there's probably a really good way to make the playtime more manageable while not cutting the gameplay too short.  I'll look into it.

There are few meaningful choices, most of which concern genes, the game is far, far too long for such luck-driven gameplay, the theme could not be more tacked on, the downtime is just ludicrous (move cubes off the board, move cubes back on the board, roll to see if you fight the drift...), and to top it all off, the components are substandard. Simply terrible. It's not broken, hence I'm not rating it a 1, but goodness gracious, I'm never playing again.

Wow, with the right mix of people this can be a real fight. After several soft plays we had a real aggresive session with rule discussions and fighting for the last point. FUN! Upgraded the rating from 8, I would always like to play if I have time for this rather long game. Excellent game, makes you realy want to play again and try new things. Perfect blend of theme and gameplay.

I really enjoyed this game. The main aim of the game is to maintain an optimum number of cards that work well together for your strategy and then have as many amobeas in play as possible to score points. Would play this one again for sure.  

3/5/2013 - Played again and enjoyed it on the second play through. Dragged more than I would like on the second play through. The game has a surprising amount of tactics to it, particularly with using the cards in combination - different strategies would certainly present with more plays. My mistake in the second play through was buying too many cards too early, that I then had to discard.

I enjoyed this game, but the other people I played with hated it.  Something significant about that is that neither of them are "gamers" and that could have a lot to do with it.  Nevertheless, I've been gunshy about introducing it to more people...but after I do, I'll alter my rating to reflect the experience.  UPDATE: played with some gamers and they liked it a lot more.  Overall a pretty good game.

At bloody long last I was able to put in a genuine game with more than just two players. The rules to Primordial Soup are short and simple, although the timing of the Environment card takes a bit of getting used to.

My partners and I enjoyed our game, and we all came up with a set of genes which all had their specific advantages. This allowed matters to become more interesting than in the few two player-games I have played eons ago; at the same time the result is not really a good simulation of Darwinian evolution as acquired genes affect the amoebas immediately. This is more like Lamarckian evolution, but only a grouser would take offense. That said, the game takes a little long to play to completion, and with the point differences as small as they are it appeared somewhat difficult to play significantly better than the opposition and consequently get comfortably ahead of the rest. Perhaps this will correct itself in the future, though I fear that the lack of numerous genes will eventually make itself felt in a way of [i]I’ve seen everything, the game is done for me[/i]. That’s a bit of a shame; that said, there is an expansion available so perhaps that would help increase the game’s longevity considerably.

For now, slightly above average. In my opinion the game needs better pacing and a more varied way of evolving oneself out of tight spots, something the two player-game lacked in its entirety.

[b]Update[/b] Replaying the game after a long break did little to foster my enthusiasm. It's really dudes on a map with special abilities which may or may not be taken away from you due to a random event. At the time the game came out this was quite an interesting design, but times [i]have[/i] changed; and frankly with Quantum in my possession I doubt the amoeba game will see much table time in the future. Rate degraded by one point.

I strongly believe in first impressions. I really do. If you explain a game to me and it sounds boring, I will not play it. But occasionally I'm wrong. When I heard the rules of Primordial Soup, I was depressed, but my buddies insisted I should give it a try. I did and it turned out it's a pretty intriguing Euro game. I didn't buy it, since two of my game group mates have it, but every now and then I'll ask for it.

Cumbersome.  Management is key but there's very little you can actively do to improve your position.  At the mercy of the environment and die rolls.  Leaders stay in front, laggers stay in back.  No major position changes, not much latitude for heroics or clever plays.  You can assemble good or timely genes though.  An okay game.

This game can be fun. I like that you can "pimp" your amebas (?) and I'm still wondering if there´s something like a killer combination. But despite this nice mechanic primordial soup doesn't hit the table too often. I guess it`s just a little bit to abstract for me and my group.

Good game, but lasts kinda long and hard to understand on the first play. The problem is getting it played enough for people to get used to the strategies in this day and age of so many board games that is hard.

I was seriously thinking about getting rid of this game. Mostly because the people I played it with didnt particurally like it and it dragged on. However I finally had a good game with people that are more into the customizing aspect of games, so it went great and I finally saw how the game really plays. Great game no doubt.

A wonderful game of managing your species of amoebas. The genes are excellently balanced and the leaders are always handicapped just that little bit that there is never any leader runaway problem and the games are always very tight. The theme is superb and the rules are really quite simple. In a way similar to Evo, but perhaps a little better due to a smaller amount of randomness present, thus also being a deeper and more thoughtful game, while being lots of fun at the same time. The only potential downside is the fiddlyness of all the pieces one has to manage and a bit too long playing time.

Humourous game from Doris and Frank. Players score points for keeping their tribe of amoeboid animals alive and nicely mutated on the game board (which represents the Primeval Soup). Each turn, amoebas eat, poop, mutate, undergo cell division and possibly die - another day in the Soup! Mutation is the fun bit, as players can purchase Gene cards to give their amoebas powers that increase their chances of survival, as well as increase victory points. The game clocks in at around two hours, but it's worth it. The gene combinations keep the game nice and replayable, and there is an expansion with even more genes floating around out there!

I played Primordial Soup once. I am glad that I had the chance to play it to compare the game to Evo. I slighty prefer Evo over Primordial Soup.

Primordial Soup was an interesting game experience overall. The concept of the game is quite different from other games that I have played.

Now that I know what the different genes do, I would want to play Primordial Soup again to to see if I would be able to perform better in the game. I had a strong start, and a very lousy finish...

Abstract, a little random and some chaos. Theme is very original. Evolution and adaptation. Would to try the expansion at some point to see the new genes.

A little long for what it gives you. Some genes are better than others, if it's well balanced or not, I would need to play it again.  

Not something I would get until I get 1 or 2 more plays.

Would want to try out the expansion.

Pretty good light strategy. A bit lighter than I typically like, but I'd play it again. I kind of wish that there was more change in the genes used during the game, such that, say, people didn't just pick up Longevity at the beginning and stick with it throughout, denying it to the other players. Sure, there are a few genes which interact and thus create environments of desirability/lack, but the limited number of each gene prevent there from being nearly as much back-and-forth evolution as there could otherwise be.

I also prefer economic games, where building a better economic engine enables you to build a better economic engine. In Primordial Soup, the income is static. Having better critters only gets you more points; it doesn't let you get better critters, except by purchasing the level 2 genes.

Primordial Soup is a textbook example of a game that lets players get anything they want except the kitchen sink.

I like it how the theme comes back in the game. Poor amoebes are having a hard time in the primordial soup.

This is probably the most disappointing game I've ever played.  It's long, it's tedious, it's incredibly fiddly (there needs to be a better way to deal with cards).  Even though everything takes forever, it's ultimately a very light game.  It might SOUND fun, but don't be fooled.

Slightly complicated mix of genes and working the scoring track, this is a great game. Not really for non-gamers, experienced gamers will want to suss out the different strategies possible. Generally a good idea to grab one of the movement genes early. Get the expansion set too. ***  I WON! My first win, against three novices but stilll a win's a win!

Thank You Z-man games.  The 5-6 player expansion fits nicely in with the basic game box.  On the dark purple & dark blue, could not see the numbers, so wrote over with a permanent silver Sharpie.  

Very clever game, and one that clearly fits the theme.  The way the cards are re-circulated is very creative.

It can be a little long, but it is really fun.  The organic nature of the game is quite unique.  The most fun: after you eat you have to excrete.  The phrase, "Did you remember to poop?" never ceases to be funny.  EVER.  (After a few more plays, once we got the flow of it it can move along nicely.  The bits are good, too.)

Nagyon ötletes, ám elég csúnyácska játék. A játékszabály rettentő egyszerű, pár mondatban elmondható, mégis rettentő jól működik a dolog. Mindenki egy-egy amőbatörzset irányít a játékban. Az amőbák kvázi véletlen-mozgással sodródnak az őslevesben. Táplálkozniuk kell, ami után kakilnak is. És itt jön a zseniális mechanizmus: Minden amőba az ellenfél játékosainak kakiját eszi, egész pontosan hármat, míg ezután a saját színéből kakil kettőt. Így a színek miatt egymás mellett kell élni, ám a mennyiség miatt mégse.
Ez persze így még unalmas lenne, ezért kerültek a játékba a génkártyák, amikből jó sok féle van. Ezek segítségével fejleszthetjük az amőbákat: kevesebbet eszik, meghatározottabban/gyorsabban mozog, és ami a leginkább növeli az interakciót: egymást is elkezdhetik megenni a mutálódott amőbák. Innentől elkezdődik a menekülés a agresszorok elől, nomeg persze a védekező gének gyűjtése.

Egyszer, gyorsan tanítható, nagyon szórakoztató játék, amiben azért van gondolkodni való is, mégha nem is extrém sok.
--------
Kicsit sok az adminisztrálás, és a génkártyák gyenge design-ja miatt sokat kell szöszölni, hogy ki mit akar vásárolni.

Újra előkerült hosszú idő után. Vegyes az érzelmeim továbbra is. Egyfelől nagyon ötletes, nagyon egyedi, nagyon hangulatos. Másfelől nehézkes, csetlő-botló a sok adminisztrálás és a génkártyás átláthatatlansága miatt.

Simply awesome game that manages to simulate life in the primordial soup. I like how different genes make your amoeba grow into very different tribes. The eat-and-poo cycle that forces some amoeba to die so that others can live is ingenious. Hands down the best biology-themed game I've seen. Plays a tad too long though.

RATING: 7
I enjoyed my playing of Primordial Soup, even if it was confused and interpreted wrongly in terms of rules, nothing to detrimental.  The evolution of the amoebas is interesting and can offer variety to each play, however there does feel to be, even with the variable powers, a sameness to the game play each round.  I look forward to playing again, largely to cement an opinion on it, and see whether or not certain feelings are warranted.  Could easily go either way in my ratings, but 7 seems safe.

A very interesting game, with several paths toward victory as you decide which genes to buy for your amoeba as they struggle for survival. Do you go agressive? Or try to be smarter and faster? I really enjoy playing this game and I think it has a good balance of random (just a small amount) and strategy.

RATING: 7
After one play.

We made our own amoebas out of clay (inspired by the pictures posted), which elevated the gaming experience significantly. The colors, though, are a mess--the board is too dark, and the blue and purple pieces (if you have the expansion) are too similar. Same with the yellow and tan--it's easy to confuse them, depending on your lighting. Game can get a little fiddly, maintaining accurate accounting of all the cubes, but for some reason we didn't mind. Maybe we were all charmed by our own creative amoebas and would love the game no matter what.

If you don't like conflict, this can be an issue, since there are genes that allow you to go after and kill other people's amoebas. Can get a little personal/take that in that way.

Game did take a long time, but again, it didn't bother us--we were having fun figuring out the game and moving our amoebas around and learning the cards. With more plays, I imagine the game will speed up, though I can also see why other people found it way too slow. We're a social group, we like to talk during our games, and this game allowed us to do that.

Fun game, would happily play again.

I imagine if I played with only what came in the box, I would sympathize more with the people who disliked the game.

RATING: 6
Components: ok games, good board, thick cards
Complex: easy to understand
Weight: medium
Players: 4, not bad with 5 or 6
Length: should be less than 2 hours, can have the risk to be longer than needed
Mechanics: grid movement, variable powers
Decisions: quite enough (buy genes, new amoebas, should I move...)
Opinion: ok game to have some fun sometimes.
You play a family of amoebas trying to survive (score points) in the primordial soup. So you have 6 amoebas, and move them through the soup looking for food.
During the game the turn goes like... move your amoebas (drift them or risk with the dice), eat (cubes of different colors or starve), buy genes (cards with powers), receive money and decide new amoebas, check deaths and score.
With all of the above you have a funny game, easy to understand and tons of interaction. I think this is a game that depends a lot on the group, with the correct group it is really funny, but you have the risk to play with someone thinking all his moves making a game really boring and long.
What did I like? that fun, the eating (you have to eat of different colors, and then place a couple of yours) and the different powers from the cards (from attacking to defense, living more, moving more, eating less....)
What didn't I like? this risk of having a long game with the inappropriate group.
This is a game I will play sometimes depending on the group, but probably won't be me the one proposing it

RATING: 6
Amoebas drifting aimlessly in the primordial soup, eating each other's excrement and developing new genes to help get a "leg" up on the competition.  If that's not the coolest theme for a game, then I don't know what is.

I really want to like Ursuppe. It has a lot of interesting design ideas, a great theme, cool bits, and provides room for some different strategic approaches. But ultimately it's a "near miss" for me. It plays out in a plodding and methodical manner. It lacks the excitement and speed necessary in a light game, but also the depth and subtlety necessary in a heavy game.

The bottom line is that this game was medium-cool in 1997, but it hasn't aged well.

Challenging game which is chaotic enough to make it a shitload of fun. 

There are a lot of strategies here to implement. I think the game works well with 3 - 4 players range, while it may be too chaotic if more players are added.

The only downside is that once the points start gaining momentum, it seems hard to catch up. There could be a runaway leader issue, yet there are ways in which the other players reacting fast can prevent that.

I'd love to play again. :)

Brings out the worst in toilet humor.  

I like the concept of having a simple organism that mutates throughout the game.  The mechanics are relatively simple.  However, there's a fair amount going on that you must keep in mind or risk having your amoebas devoured by others.

I'm worried that it's pretty unforgiving of mistakes as there is no easy way to catch up if you fall behind.

RATING: 2
Primordial Soup is about managing amoeba as they travel across the board and eat, ensuring that food is always available. This spacial management is entertaining, trying to feed your characters each turn, but for purposes of scoring, is somewhat meaningless. The game scored by the amount of upgrade cards and amoebas on the field. These choices are uninteresting as everyone just wants the most cards and most amoebas. To score, it doesn't matter where they are, only that they are present and have card bonuses. Feeding is fun, but the game focuses on the "unfun" to the point where doing well is somewhat arbitrary and not engaging.

Quite original and interesting gamer's game. You have hard decisions in choosing genes and where to place your amoebas. There is some luck with the dice and environment cards, but it is more about being prepared for whatever may happen. The biggest problem may be the difficulty to catch up if you fall behind. Also, the bland components, although very functional, detract from the experience, causing a quite thematic game to feel like an abstract.

Great high interaction euro design!  Killing, special powers, and its the best "eat my poop" game out there.  Not that complex, and the special powers (aka genes) really make the game run well.  My only complaints are the boring components and the sometimes anticlimactic finish from runaway leader issues.  You really have to make an effort to go after the leader a little bit to keep the game close.  This is one that gets better the more you play it because people know the genes and understand what they need to do to kill the leader better.

I really like the basic idea of the game, it's fun and not too common, you dont have the feeling that it's just yet another game pretty similar to others, but with four players it can last too long for my taste (well, or just there isn't much happening during that time, i dont know), and it cant be played by two. Still i won't say no if i'm asked to play.

There are things that I really like about this game, such as the ability to buy various upgrades. Each of them seems appropriately powerful, though some seem more useful than others. Owning more of these powers gets you more points. Also, you score more points the more amoebas you own. However, very little time during the game is actually spent on purchasing amoebas and upgrades. 90% of the game is scooting your amoebas around the board, trying to have them not die through starvation or attacks by other players. Considering that none of this actually scores you points and it is simply a way to retain your money so it can be spent on more upgrades, it seems a little out of balance as far as the experience goes. Additionally, precious few of the powers actually relate to your economy (discounts, etc.) so there is really no engine-building here like you might expect. Rather, it's a game of opportunistic take-that. Very interactive and mostly a pretty fun experience, but I do think the powers could have been broadened and the scoring should have been more based on what is happening on the board. Scoring is peculiar anyway, as there are only two categories as mentioned (amoebas and upgrade cards) and when scoring, you leapfrog over other players. It creates a peculiar tension that at times makes you feel powerless and at other times creates a gamesmanship I don't really like. I'd like to see this system redone with some of the current euro sensibilities, but I recognize that it would probably just turn it into a point salad with no interaction, which is a shame, since the simplicity of scoring and player interaction are its strongest points.

Very clever game with cool rule bending gene mutations. It seems to need 4 players though as it might get a little easier for folks with the gene modifier that allows you to eat any colored cubes more powerful than it already is.

A bizarrely-themed, but totally fun game. This may provoke more outright laughter and competitive enjoyment than any other game I've played. Players move their amoebas about in the primordial atmosphere, eating, excreting, and evolving. Each player needs the cubes produced by others to survive, making for an interesting tension between your dependence on and competition with the other players. Finding interactions between the types of genes can be surprising and delightful (parasitism and holding is a nice combo, for example). The only real drawback to me is that the game takes quite a while to really get going, and then can end abruptly, feeling as though it is over just as it was getting really interesting.

I need to actually try and play this, but the requirement to have 3-4 people only makes it tough, as my usual group size is either 2 or 4-5.  The two hour table time makes it tough to play as well.  Maybe this will have to go in the trade pile eventually.

Very slow start. Multiple strategies to victory. Very exciting end. It's biggest weaknesses are length, lots of fiddly pieces to mess with, and the slow start.

That said I love creature building games, and that applies to all creatures great and small. In this case small, as small as you can get. That doesn't hurt the fun though. I'd love to play a shorter version of this.

The basic play of sludging around randomly in the primordial soup, hoping to eat and not be eaten, is charming. If the game were 60 minutes instead of 120 minutes the complete lack of control over your movement would be more tolerable. But since it *is* 120 minutes the game felt overly long and soon enough the turns felt tedious. For the last 30 minutes there was little chance of anyone overtaking the leader.

Very bloodthirsty compared to most Euros, which was a nice change of pace, but the overall package just didn't thrill me.

I find this a very charismatic game with an apparently unique mechanic of slopping around, producing your own "colour" of waste matter and consuming matter of every other colour.  Add to that the fact that you can "evolve" special abilities but that solar radiation will occasionally devolve those who have evolved too much and you have a bizarrely compelling game!

2011-10-25: Just nudged this down to a 7.  A recent play reminded me that it takes too long to play!

Ultimately, I traded away because the design feels bloated compared to modern games.  It out-stays its welcome.  I'd love to try a streamlined implementation, though.

RATING: N/A
Needs 3-4 players, and about 2 hours long (less once experienced when other players can do the somewhat arduous cube shuffling).  Expansion adds 5-6 players, but that means too much down-time & new gene cards - mixed opinions on these, some say don't use them all at once, but can give more variety to basic game.  Note there are also community-generated cards out there.  Need to understand ALL gene cards to get full benefit strategically, which can also slow things down.  I really like the theme, but just wondering if it would be a bit slow and repetitive after a while.

I think there needs to be more ways to improve your position relative to someone.  I see early leaders never caught up with, and other 'run away leader' like things.

RATING: 6
Who can resist a game themed around eating and excreting? However, once you get past the charming microbes you tend to notice that the card drawing and die rolling introduces a lot of randomness into a board situation that already has a huge chaos factor. The emphasis of the game is on getting a good combination of gene cards, but I'm not sure their value is related to purchase cost. You've about as much control here as you have over real evolution.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
So the theme is obviously great, but the game was a little frustrating to me.  Players can't predict where they will be going on the next turn, which makes it a little difficult to really plan, and it's very easy to paint one's creatures into a corner.  Some of the cards appear powerful but are really underpowered relative to others.  The game was also longer than I wanted it to be.  Play Evo, it's better. (1 play)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Note" Only played twice so my rating may change.  

It's definetely not like your traditional Eurogame as players will evolve into differnt genes (game modifying rules) that drastically alter the way they individually view the tactical situation.  Repeated plays are necessary to see which genes are a good fit for each other and to get a feeling of the caefull balance between the BP's on hand (and used for player actions) vs the ozone thickness variation from turn to turn. 

Game mechanic works against leader much the same way as powergrid does with score order  movement in the various game phases.

Although there is a bit of luck, it can be minimized by some extent by carefull gene selection and I didn't feel that it had a great bearing on the outcome of the game in any event.    

There is a lot of user interaction but it's of the aggresive variety.. :)

RATING: 7
The game was fun with atmosphere and the cards making up the bulk of what was good.  I thought that the scoring track made it too difficult to go it alone and take an initial lead.  It seemed a better plan to stick to the rear of the pack and just make a move at the end.  So in that way it really felt a bit like a waiting game.  Also, the game lasted an abysmally long time.  Which I am sure in part was because people were over analyzing the cards but also in part because there were so many steps to each round.  Still, I had a fun time and would likely play it again.  Yeah poo jokes!

Un juego quizá demasiado largo para lo que es en realidad… aunque tampoco recomiendo a los no jugones iniciarse con él. Buena mecánica la de diversidad de genes, porque es interesante el detenerse a pensar y encontrar combos útiles, así como la mecánica de “comer y excretar”: mover, comer, cagar, y quizá morir… otro día más en la Sopa. Tiene su propia ecología… mata a demasiados enemigos y no podrás sobrevivir (no “cagarán” fichitas de su color); aumenta tu población en exceso y morirás de éxito… Cada partida es única. De verdad.

"Man, I just need one more poop to eat or I die!"  What can you really say about engineering the mutations of poop-eating amoebas as a game?  Well, for starters, the theme is perfect.  Ursuppe (or Primordial Soup) is a great strategy game with some very easy yet deep mechanics and options.  The scoring track is neat also since you can "hop" people and decide when to lead the pack and when to follow.  The only negative comment I really have is for the components which are pretty butt-ugly (and the art as well to some extent).  I'm a huge bits whore though, so a lot of my rating is composed of that very fact...sadly.

This is such a good game. The mechanics are soooo clever, the more I play the deeper I feel it gets. We are now experimenting with playing without the cell-division or the one that gives you BP if you drift (can't remember its name) as these tend to be unbalancing. A must for anyone's collection.

One of the best games in terms of being faithful to its theme.  The dynamics are very true to a fight for survival in a resource constrained environment.

Ideal Players: 3-4

Description: You're a species of amoeba! Eat, excrete, grow, and evolve.

Pro: Fantastic combination of theme with mechanics. Each game tells a story of evolution and competition. Different mutations provide different paths to victory. Every game is different. Random drift provides a great random element without ruining the strategy of the game. Player interaction is forced as they expand, and required because they feed off each others' waste. Amusing graphics.

Con: Runaway leader can be a problem if other species don't respond quickly. Bits are a little plain and blocky, although high quality.

The game looks like a lot of fun. I like the art a lot. I was surprised though how much more fierce the game was though and how long it took. I was expecting something lite and easy but got a pretty meaty game instead.

I liked seeing how the board changed and how different genes resulted in vastly different tactics by players. Some people were moving around like crazy, others hardly had to eat, while others just ate other players, and the last just didn't care too much about dying because they reproduced like crazy.

I think the game could use another play but it was too long and chaotic for my wife so it may be a while before I can give it another go.

The basic rules of Ursuppe are fairly simple. However the Gene cards add a signficant level of complexity resulting in a relatively lengthy and involved game. The theme is great fun, providing some necessary light relief along the way. The game is much better with 4 than with 3 players.

A game of evolution and survival ... basically a finicky, more complex, and longer game than EVO.

Best for 3 players, while EVO is best for 4 or 5.

RATING: 6
Nice mix of visual/theme & strategic appeal, therefore appealing to a combination group of wargamer/family-gamer. Since you are limited in gene choices by cost, it is helpful to decide between pursuing strategies of movement/aggression, food flexibility, & reproduction/longevity. 3 opens up the board too much and 6 players makes it drag.

RATING: 7
initial rating 3 players...

One of the best themed games I've played since Fury of Drac and Die Macher as in the theme works so well with the mechanics. The game is also quite unique and FUN scoring points where many others fail. 

I really don't get the 'deep' comments but there is some great strategical and tactical play and certainly some critical decision making to be had. My favourite card/gene/special power was the ability to eat opponents rather than starve implementing a slight war effect and making for great screwage! Once I myself got eaten I quickly purchased an escape card. 

Great balance in the game and the cards, some cards are quite good but cost more to buy. There is a good dose of luck in the environment card effecting your cards/money and also movement and eating which is critical to survival but some measures can be taken to mitigate this. Nice catch-up mechanic built in allowing the losing player to 'eat' first but it does appear hard to catch the leader here. 

I really want to try 4 players, I sense some chaos at that number and possibly a longer game than it is already although there might be more food to eat. Biggest knock was the length which could easily be fixed. Rating could rise with a game length tweak and more plays...

(No official 2P support, but there are variants to play two amoeba races each.)

In spite of deck of cards and dice rolls, this is a low luck game. Manage a race of amoeba, use your energy to grow more amoeba or to mutate to get unique abilities. Having amoeba on the board or highly evolved amoeba gets you points each turn.

It has enough "silly" and enough "smart", just a little bit of downtime problem due to mostly one-player-at-a-time turns with a fair bit of upkeep. Theme is tightly and seemlessly integrated into play.

This game is too long for the amount of luck it contains. It seems like you are rolling dice for one reason or another on almost every turn, and yet... There is something special about this game that makes me rate it higher than I think it may deserve - the way the theme and mechanics uniquely tie together; the fun, high-grade artwork; the cool amoeba pieces; the poop jokes - when you play this game, it just feels like you are having an experience that no other game can give you. I'm not convinced the genes are well-balanced and I think the VP acquisition is a bit too slow. I may experiment with adding a victory point to every level and see if that helps with the length. Not a game I'll pull out a lot, but a game I'm glad to have on my shelf.

When reading through the rules I was surprised how short and easy Eurogame rules were back in the days. The complexity comes with the special genes which basically represent rule modifications. The basic mechanism is clean and simple. It might have a runaway leader problem. The simple scoring mechanism doesn't leave too much possibilities for players to catch up. You need a certain number of genes and a certain number of amoebas. With reasonable play it should be possible to maintain these levels once you have a working combination of genes - which you should have because otherwise you wouldn't be in the lead. It lacks the decisive spark to become a very good game. I could imagine playing through the phases getting a bit repetitive with multiple plays.

I need more plays to decide if it goes up a point or two or just stays in place but who knows when I'll get a chance to play again.

Really nice and original abstract system that uses its theme quite well. Unfortunately a bit prone to AP with the cell division phase and obviously while getting genes as there are pretty many from which to pick and you want them to combo. Many different strategic and inside single turn also tactical choices with which to aim for the victory.

I reckon this is a little long and fiddly for a strategy game; it takes a while before you can gain much control, and you'll never be free of the ur-chaos. I reckon you could do much worse for a family game, though. It's funny that a game with more catch-up elements than you can readily summarize still has a tangible runaway leader phenomenon.

I liked the concept behind the game. I just didn't care for the game itself. The art was crap. It just fell flat for me. Perhaps if it were reprinted with neat looking bits and nice art it could be a winner. In it's current iteration though, my eyes hurt just looking at it.

Rating after 2 plays.  Pleasant, but requires lots of fiddly housekeeping, moving pieces around. 
It seemed odd, in our 3-player game, how 1 player got and kept the aggression ability, making it impossible for the other 2 to ever play aggressively.  Yes, we could work on _winning_ strategies, but we were not given the option of using any _aggressive_ strategies, so we still felt stifled.
In a second game, we 2 human players used the third-player AI found in the bgg file section, and it worked quite well.

You play an amoeba and try to evolve by adding new genes to your gene pool that give you some special powers.
It's a lot of fun to play. But don't expect too much depth from it. While it has some strategy it can also contain a lot of chaos. But that just makes part of the fun while you try to build the ultimate gene pool...

The game that I would like to play that no one else seems to want to play.

I have been looking forward to owning this for quite some time. Finally gave in and bought the german version, mostly due to the way cool "Ursuppe" title :) 

The game is perhaps somewhat long for what you get, but the old school "american style" gameplay appeals to me. Probably a little better with four than three.

RATING: 7
Acquired pre-2003. Only played once in 2006. Total number of plays > 10. Amoeba float in the primordial soup eating stuff and excreting other stuff that other amoebas can eat. Acquiring genes allows your amoeba to do neat stuff. Funny game that plays in fixed phases like some of the old school wargames. Only drawback is its length. Seems to take ~2 hours which I think is a bit too long for the enjoyment derived from the game.

The basic set of rules is pure chaos, but the evolutions allow you to harness control over the situation. Or, at least, try. Each evolution has the potential of creating a cascade effect, forcing other players to adapt to the situation at hand. Best evolution-themed board game I've played, hands down.

We need to play it again as we didn't make it through the whole thing.  It wasn't the game's fault, it was a late night at Gencon when we started it.  The idea of this game is really cool, but I'm struggling currently to figure out which powers are better.  I don't usually like to play "Mean" but those attack cards seem to be more powerful.  Hopefully more plays will help.

This is a fun game. The common comment that it takes a bit longer than it should is understandable as the game does take a bit to run to completion, but I found it didn't outstay its welcome. Its ok for games to be a bit longer if they stay interesting and I found the cycles the board went through to keep me interested. I enjoyed how dead zones would develop, and then an area would be rejuvenated with dying creatures. Nicely thematic.

The Primordial Soup is supposedly where all life came from. Players take charge of a tribe of amoeba as they struggle to survive. In order to help their quest, tribes will take various genetic advantages, which allow them to 'break' the rules of life. For instance, instead of going hungry, your amoeba could learn to attack foreign amoeba for food. Or perhaps your amoeba could be taught to need less food to survive. Either way, this is a very interesting take on the game of life.

Played once, 4p.  Wow, did I hate this game.  I wanted the game to end way before the midway point.  A mistake on the first turn is very difficult to recover from, especially with even competent opponents.  There are some neat mechanisms in the game, though; I like the drift movement mechanic, the resources consumed vs. resources generated, and the variable powers.  However, some of the powers seemed way better than others, and, since most powers were only available to one player, they often had an unassailable advantage, and the argument that one should get that power first next game does not make the game better.

Ameobas with superpowers and Doris Matthäus artwork, what else do u want from a comic book... err... I mean a boardgame?  

I very fondly remember playing this my first time at WBC.....  A passing gamer walks by, is intrigued and reads & checks out the back cover.  After a minute, he then says non-chalantly, "Ohh...

A fun resource-management game that mimics the biosphere insofar as what seems like random chaos on the board is actually the result of a rigidly orderly process. Gameplay is sort of a cross between Cosmic Encounter and Carcassonne. The shiny and colorful wooden bits are fun to mess with, but if you let your attention lapse for even a second it's awfully easy to forget which ones go where, and by so doing to screw up a game that's already been going for an hour or so.

An older game but an excellent one.  You start with amoebas in the primordial soup.  You buy new genes to get better at feeding.  You can also attack other amoebas with some genes.  Reproduce and add genes to score points.  It is a race in a sense to get to the end of a track as the most successful and advanced amoebas.  

It has a nice expansion that adds some fan genes, including one that two that one of my gamer friends designed.

Game can run long with younger kids but family weight for kids 8 and up.

RATING: 7
This is a great game with loads of theme--it's all about the eating and pooping.  One amoeba's poop is another's food.  If you've got 3 or 4 people, I'd highly recommend bringing this one out.  The pace could be a bit faster as it tends to drag a bit by the end.  A good variant is to play to fewer victory points.

Picked up in 2006 (Boxing Week 2005) - Math Trade 2007

I like this game, but it has way too many little bits to manage and the play is generally not for casual gamers. I'd like to keep this one but it won't really see much table time so I am willing to trade it for something better. Once the expansion comes out having new gene cards should add to the tactical options but I can't imagine playing this with more than 4 people.

This game is just BEGGING for DIY amoebas made out of Sculpy clay.

Neil Thompson concludes in his review: "Primordial Soup is a game worth exploring and it relies on substance over appearance. Actually the game borders on bland to ugly and is my major gripe. But the game play is excellent and it will play differently each time if you explore the various combinations of genetics available.

Evo is a similar game that allows for evolution and mutation (with dinosaurs). It is decidedly more visually appealing but I am undecided on which game is the better of the two at this point."

With a rating over 7, and accessibility to kids 9 and over, it's worth getting if the price is right (tanga 8/1/11 has it for about $16+7s/h but I missed it).

Playing amoebae swimming around in a puddle and eating each other's excrements. Doesn't this sound like fun? Developing genes to eat less or to eat others, wriggling to avoid drifting the wrong way.
I would have bought this just for the theme. Luckily the game itself is also great. Only problem is that newbies need to study all of the available genes from the start if the want to play competitively.

Who doesn't want to be an amoeba? Eat or be eaten, though usually both. In part you go with the flow, in part you have some control over your fate. Your amoebas can evolve via Gene cards, though only so much as the environment keeps that in check. Very silly and very fun. The artwork is priceless.

subsequent plays might increase rating but my initial impression was: longish, tedious and too luck-driven for its weight.
one rule is especially poor and is responsible at least 2 poins minus in its rating: you get points for amoebae that you have just 'bought' and also for those that have died in the turn. this means that you get at least 4 points for an amoeba and if you buy the card that gives you discout on buying them then you don't have to do anythig else in the game

RATING: 8
Unique theme and plausible system. You can enjoy evanescent lives of amoebae drifting, eating, excreting, fighting and fleeing, dividing, dying... all in the small primordial soup. It's also fun to breed various kinds of amoebae(amoebae-swift, amoebae-ganster, amoebae-parasite, amoebae-long-lived-and-prolific, etc.) out of various kinds of genes. Quite strategic, yet very humorous.

--UPDATE, April 2007--
Now I see that it has some flaws, as a game of skill.


1) Mainly full of trivial choices, with a few decisive choices: It is very costly, if not impossible, to react tacticaly to ever-changing status of primordial soup. Because keep buying genes cost much, you'd better keep with a combination of a few genes. Of course demand on long term strategy is not a bad thing, but in this game, there is rarely a real, decisive choice after you decided what genes you would buy.

2) It is hard to catch on: Difference of given VPs is rather small and scoring is so accumulative, it is very hard, if not impossible, to catch the leader on, after one gets behind. Of course "gang up on the leader" is another thing which is not good, but here catching the leader is too hard.

3) Misvalued genes: Some genes are misvalued. E.g. "Streamlining" is too powerful for such a price. "Defense" is too weak for that price.

Despite those flwas, I still like this game very much.

First reason is that, I like not only games for win, but also games for experience. What I wrote above (before UPDATE) is still right. What else game could make me experience a life of amoeba?

Second reason is personal. It is the first game which I bought new, the first game which I was astounded with the combination of theme and mechanics, the first overproduced game which I played, the first game which I really loved. This kind of affection doesn't easily go away.

UPDATE--------------------
Recently played again. I was surprised that there were subtle strategic and tactical decisions, more than I have thought. Rating up to 9.5 again.

RATING: 7
Played a few times now. The theme is cool, but the game seems a bit dry at times. I can see there is a lot of different strategies here. Game play mistakes typically arent made anymore now that we know how it all works, but the evolutionary chain may never be the same.

Update: 10-02-2006

Played this over the weekend and really had fun. Now that the mechanics are "down", it was easier to enjoy the actual game. We were a group of 4 players (two who had never played). It was very close for 3 of us and came down to a single attack/defense roll. I can wait for the 5-6 player expansion in 2007.

Primeros dos juegos con un sabor de querer conocer algo más. Los encontré un poco largos (3 y 4 jugadores). Hay que conocer bien las tarjetas de genes para poder pensar en algo estratégico.

First 2 plays with a taste to know something more. Probably a bit long (3 and 4 players). It is necessary to know very well the gens card to thing in some kind of strategy.

Sold because is rather boring and predictable

7/26/06: Rating of 8 based on 2 plays.  So far, we're having a grand time playing.  Learning the interaction of genes, and learning how to react not just to the environment but to others' gene choices has been great fun so far.  If there are any gene combo "ruts" to fall into, I can see the rating going down, but so far, this game is a great way to spend a couple of hours.  If we don't have that much time, it's a very easy game to shorten, as well.

9/5/06: Two more plays so far, and I'm keeping it at 8.  Very fun game.  Not quite enough to it to get a 9 from me, but a solid 8.  All four games have been very different, and we haven't found any "killer combos" yet in this game.  I'm looking forward to playing again.

It’s fun, light, interesting, good theme
Picking the genes is strategic, yet a small physical part
Moving, eating, pooping is good and more strategic/interesting than some think
Each turn takes a bit longer than you would like (lots of bits)
The game overall is just a little bit longer than you would like for a light game

It’s different, and that’s good. If you’re tired of farming or influencing the 17th century nobility, or are scared of learning about dice and statistics, then this might be for you.

A game made in heaven for a science geek who grew up in the 70s. The pieces look like leftovers from your high school science lab! It plays like a tabletop version of that Life simulation you used to run on your TRS-80. Still, its good for other people too. It can be a bit heavier to teach, and copies of the reference sheets would be good, as they are referred to FREQUENTLY. Many different strategies with the genes can bring you victory -- it all depends on what the others have chosen. Can be a bit lop-sided if they all choose poorly and you choose good genes; but with a good group, or some help they can catch on. Brought a lot of humor to the group; how many games let you poop?

After one (3er) game, this one left me surprisingly underwhelmed.  The first few rounds were interesting, but towards the end of the game, it started to plod and drag.  I didn't feel like we were *going* anywhere, and there just wasn't enough tension to keep me invested in my little amoebae.  Liked the tentacle gene though.

RATING: 6
Ursuppe is a mixed bag for me.  The game has many neat elements with the gene cards creating amazing variety.  At the same time the game is a bit fiddly and this adds to its length.

Once someone gets the struggle for survival gene everything turns on its edge in most games.  Your strategy needs to somehow adapt.

After playing Dominion (years after Ursuppe was released) I think a better way to play this game might be to alter the number of genes available to the players (especially if you own the expansion sets) each game.  Having only 10 or 20 genes in the pool might shorten the game length (it seems like using the full compliment of genes ensures players will deliberate for hours and then change their mind as to the best options available).

Some gene combinations are pretty amazing and will always work no matter what the rest of the environment throws at you.

You need a big table to hold all the gene cards and the board and bits.

A fun game still with a neat theme, nice artwork on the cards and of course very unusual pieces.

04/07/04 Played a four-player game of Ursuppe. Even though I lost, badly, I had fun making constant "poop" references, which one of the other players found quite distasteful and annoying. Hey, it kept me interested! I'd certainly play it again.
09/18/10 Played a three-player game of Primordial Soup. I like it. But the large number of genes (20) to chose from is bewildering to a new player. Unlike Urland, where you only have to worry about the 4 or so up for bid at any one time.

Ursuppe 
New in collection april 07.
Very, very good & fun game. The theme is hilariously appropriate and surprisingly relaxing for "a cut-throat struggle for food" game. Very easy to imagine yourself floating along in the primordial soup, hoping that you'll be able to surpass your companions in this basic struggle for life. With the right players even the downtime is enjoyable in this one.The only disadvantage: takes a bit too long with basic rules. Easy solution: shorten the point path & the number of windrose cards.I'll probably always want to play this with 4.

NL: Hilarisch, tactisch & strategisch. Je hebt een roedeltje domme microbes die een beetje ronddobberen en spartelen in de prehistorische oersoep. Ze overleven op de drollen van je medespelers. Klinkt uitnodigend toch?

The most strongly themed game about amoeba floating around that I've ever played. Gameplay works well, even though it's a little fiddly. Everyone will get the hang of it after a few rounds. "Don't forget to poo!"

The biggest downside is that it's a little slow and long for what it is.

A decent game, a bit like Evo but less war-game like.  The digestion/excretion cycle is  clever.

Drawbacks: the components are ugly, and important information is off board.  It would be nice if you could slide improvements onto your amoebas.

RATING: 7.5
Rated after 1 play.  I suspect further play may either increase OR decrease the rating.

This is a fairly abstract cube pusher, with a great theme that does come through.  Maybe it's not fair to call it abstract...?

The variable player powers are where the fun of this game lies.  And the powers are fairly thematic.  The artwork also helps the theme, and I like the presentation quite a lot, other than the board art.

The knocks against the game are that it is pretty fiddly with the upkeep, and many turns end up feeling fairly deterministic.  It's quite tactical with the only longish-term strategy coming in the choice of player powers, though decisions do definitely affect later turns.

In the end, this is a genre-busting game, which marries a lot of things together.  It seems very "euro" but there is a lot of player interaction and attacking.  There's also a LOT of luck, but it can be mitigated quite well.  Like the theme it's portraying, the game is a fun hodgepodge.  I think it would be best with a group that can play it quickly, but it does encourage you to plan everything out and with a constant change of game-state this deterministic quality can make it long and dry.

A fun game, but seems to take a little long to play.  A bit too long, as the winner often determined a lot earlier.  If one were to play often, I think there are probably some optimal gene collections that could skew play.  Anyone have a good two-player varient?  Looks great on the table, and the theme is great.

I played this game a long time ago.  My brother asked me to get it in an order I was placing for some games, so I did some research on it here and decided it wasn't a game I would be interested in.  When it came I played a game with my brother and I don't think it has really made it out since.

I don't remember too much about the game, except you are moving amoebas around the board and eating the other players' poop while leaving your own.  You lose your amoebas if you can't get enough food.  Maybe I should give this one another shot since it has been so long, but that probably won't happen.

Amøber, der driver omkring i urhavet, som vinden blæser er et helt forunderligt spil. Charmen ligger i at mutere sine amøber, og det sker meget ofte som direkte modreaktioner til de andre spilleres valg af mutationer, og det nærmest organiske samspil, der er mellem dem, er meget fascinerende - og sjovt at spille. De finurlige tegninger giver dem en ekstra bonus.

I'd play Primoridial Soup again, though perhaps a shortened version of it. The card combos and overall theme are fun. It's impossible to come up with any long-term plan, unless you want to just get a couple cards and stick with it, in which case the game will probably feel a little repetitive. Downtime can be considerable, as you wait for everyone to run through the movement and feeding of their amoebas, especially later in the game, when there are so many on the board. Nonetheless, I think the game is entertaining and would probably go faster with players who already know how to play.

You are making obvious decisions most of the times, and sometimes at the mercy of the dice. The "no two pawns can apply the same scoring space" doesn't make much sense in this particular game either.

I liked a lot about this game. The pieces were nice and fun to play with (although you may have a little trouble at first with putting the dowels in your amoebas), and the play went pretty quickly even for a group of first-timers. It's lighthearted, colorful, and isn't too stressful. On our first run, we played the three-player version with an amateur (hi), an intermediate gamer, and a battle-hardened veteran, and we all had a great time. However, we had four players on our second go of it, and we all felt it dragged on a little longer than necessary. I suspect this is an excellent 3-player, and pretty good 4-player game.

Players take on the role of amoebas  drifting around in the primoridal soup. Pay for genes to give your amoebas abilities (breed quicker, move better, etc). I enjoyed this game. We played 4 or 5 games in '98 and '99, then since then it hasn't been brought out. I suspect it could be due to the game length, and the owner of the game isn't overly fond of the game. I like the idea of moving your amoebas, genes that give them unique powers. Some luck with dice for movement, where the drift will occur next time, and when sun shines through and could burn those whose value genes are too high. Like Lowenherz, we don't play this game enough.

1st playing was pretty tough, since there was a number of rules confusions.  Though none of these affected game play since they were caught early enough.  Hard to understand, but seems to be well worth the effort.  Looking to playing again.

One of the first hobby games I played. Was a lot of fun "building" a new ameba and eating other ameba's poop (but never your own! thats just gross). Teaching this game to new people, the biggest set back is the access every player has to all the mutations at once. New people tend to be overwhelmed with this and want to avoid it.

It is what it is.  Presents some challenge in how to pace oneself and how to work the gene combos.  A bit on the long side, but it gets an extra point for uniqueness.

Seems like there are several viable strategies to this game. Tentacles seems vary useful, as well as frugality. Combined they seem like they might make a game winning combination.

This game looks like a wierd science experiment. It really is unique and gives players the feeling of gradual evolution (in a good way). It is hard to make an immediate impact in a single turn and therefore it can be hard to catch up with or slow down an early leader. Upkeep can also be a bit of a chore, but it's worth it, especially with four players. (6.5)

New Z-man Primordial Soup version.

Very engaging game with a theme that is tightly interwoven into the gameplay and mechanics.  There is a definite learning curve here, and some gene combinations work much better together than others, so much of the curve is spent learning how the genes interact with each other.

The die rolls for movement (and, to a lesse extent, defending) do add some random elements to the game, but it does appear that for the most part, your ending position will have more to do with your play skill than anything else.

An okay evolution themed game, though rather Chaotic/random.

There is a large number of 'genes' you can choose to buy, so you have to study the menu carefully. Also the theme is amusing - you are (within the context of the games narrative) required to eat poop or die! 

You can also eat other players precious Amoebas, which is fun.

A marvellous theme, building up gene combinations to dominate and conquer the other microbes in the primordial soup. There are some powerful combinations that people need to be very aware of to counter in time. The gene decisions can be difficult and can make or break you. The rest of the game can be fairly straight forward to play out (eating other cubes), with the luck of the turned over direction card influential at times. But all in all, it's a nice package that I enjoy playing.

Although the game plays itself partially, it still provides a lot of options and frustration, but in a good way. Mainly, you want to have as many Amoebas on the board as possible, gene cards are helpful as well, but they are hard to keep, so you need to get a good combo which can really make a regular card more valuable. Lots of fun, yet simple enough for most people. The fact that you cannot control everything may not go well with some players. Plays well at three and four, but differently.

This game is very reminiscent of Evo, with every-turn scoring based on the number of surviving critters, and special gene enhancements that help your critters survive better.  The availability of all the gene cards at once does allow you to react better to what's going on, but also throws a ton of information in your face all at once--it's a lot to process, especially if you're just learning the game.  This game is drier and less fun than Evo, and often it feels like decisions are made for you in this game.

3/27/10: rec'd in trade with Dune (French edition) for Merchants of Venus.

2014: managed to get this to the table exactly once (other than a couple of solitaire plays). It fell flat. For me, it just felt like there wasn't enough there to pursue. In the mid-1990's, for maybe about 2 years (before Puerto Rico/Princes of Florence), it might have found some table time. Not today. Dropping to a "4".

I'll eat your p'uppe if you eat mine. Great idea and entertaining artwork. Don't know which is more interminable: manipulating the foodstuff or studying the four-page menu during each gene acquisition phase.

The genes make the game.  Some are a little better than others, but they're generally priced right.  Another game that isn't overly friendly to first time players.  The movement/drifting is a little lucky, but if you don't like luck, get movement 2 and you basically have a luck free game.  Great!

Really enjoy the strong theme there! Only played once, although we set the finishing line much earlier, still took us a while to finish it (none of us had played it before, though, so we had to refer to the rules regularly). I had great fun  (mind you I won, it helps liking the game!)but was playing with some non-players who clearly didn't like it (couldn't be bothered to listen to the rules, and decided it was too complicated anyway...)One thing though... the plastic bags for the bits (especially the food cubes) should be resealable! Once we opened them for a first game, we had nowhere to keep them safe  for the journey back home...

There are some interesting choices: what gene combos to pick, whether to buy more genes or more amoebas, what direction of the board to grow/move toward, and whether to risk a random move or go with the drift.  But the board is such a mess of little German cubes!  It all feels like unprocessed data passing through four subroutines of a larger computer program and undergoing a transformation that's difficult for a human to predict.  Perhaps I'm describing something that happens in plenty of other games, but I prefer that a game not *feel* like a series of transformations of meaningless data.

Very easy and great fun.  A lightweight game that's just about short enough to consider as a warm-up game.  Good concept and very appealing artwork.  The only shortcoming are that there are some obvious "super-combinations" of genes, and that the environment deck is too small (thus once you've played the game a couple of times you get a feel for what's left in the deck as the game goes on).

Fun game where your pieces need to eat cubes of other player's colors to survive, and upon doing so you drop cubes of your color. It's a fun game in concept and the art on the evolution cards is pretty cute.

It does suffer from a long time between turns, and since all cards are available for purchase at any time, you do tend towards analysis paralysis with so many different cards to pick from.  Additionally, there is a small bit of randomness where you need to have a decent amount of money on hand for when the game randomly decides you can only have 6 points of upgrades instead of the average of 9-12. This determination is chosen by random event card, and you don't know what it will be ahead of time, which makes planning a challenge.

All that being said, I do enjoy this game a lot. It's a really fun and creative abstract that only suffers a little from it's age. There are many clever mechanisms here that are ahead of it's time, such as having turn order determined by who has the most points, and then when a player gains points they leapfrog over other player's scoring markers not counting those spaces, thereby acting as a catch-up mechanism.

This game, which I'd wanted to try for a while, turns out to have several unappealing features. There's a lot of fiddling around with cubes (at least they represent poo though!), it's too long for the number of real decisions, it's hard to catch up and it has the chaotic board state and long turns that are a recipe for AP. But somehow I still liked it! The board is huge and subtly attractive and it feels a bit like playing with a scientific simulation rather than a game. The genes have interesting effects and there must be lots of combos we didn't discover.

Was pleasantly surprised by this game. I wasn't having high hopes given its age and how it looked, but as usual you should never judge a game solely by how it looks. The gameplay is solid. However it very much reminds me of Evolution in terms of the rough idea of gameplay--grabbing traits to constantly adapt to the environement and the opponents around you. And Evolution does it smarter. 

My main complaint with the game was the random die rolling for movement which could really have large impacts on the outcome of the game. I also wasn't a huge fan of the limit on many traits as I'd have preferred all players to be able to evolve however they wanted to. 

Still it was an enjoyable game worth playing and I'd do so again.

This game is about eating poop.  I'm a fan of interesting themes and from that standpoint Primordial soup hits the nail on the head.  It's a bit clunky and confusing, though novel and thematic.

Players field an army of amoebas drifting around a small primordial tide pool.  The game is a "phasing game" like Power Grid or Age of Steam.  The various phases include pooping and eating of poop, buying new genes and amoebas with "Biological Points" (BPs), drifting (in a largely uncontrolled fashion), and dying so that other amoebas can feast on the carcasses.   

It's a fairly restrained and methodical game, particularly in the beginning.  That is probably its biggest weakness.  Players get rationed 10 BPs a turn.  The cost of Genes and new Amoebas makes it hard to make big purchases unless you save up over a few turns.  Amoebas drift slowly.

The biggest draw for me is the plethora of Gene cards.  In order to get over the slow methodical course of the game players will want to get Gene cards.  These allow Amoebas to move more effectively, eat more efficiently, procreate faster and even eat each other.  Players will need to buy genes in response to each others purchases.  There is an Ozone Layer mechanism that keeps players from getting too many Gene cards.

This leads to two important considerations that must be made.  First, what genes to buy.  This will be determined by what the other players have purchased, your own needs as well as how many BPs you have.  Second, where to go.  It's important to have a constant source of food to keep your Amoebas alive.

Primodial Soup is one of those games that is both interesting, but also captures its theme very well.  Though certainly not a simluation the importance of following food sources and adapting to predators and the environment are of utmost importance.  One of the key elements of the game is that Amoebas must eat the poop of Amoebas of other colors.  When they do, they poop cubes of their own color.  If you isolate your Amoebas from the other players' you can find yourself awash in a sea of your own fecal matter with nothing to eat.  Doesn't that make for a pretty picture?

RATING: 4.5
UPDATE: Dropped from a 6 to a 4.5.

There is so much I want to like about this game. Lots of different powers that persist; no one-use powers. Ample opportunities to attack the leader.

However, the only strategic part of the game is when players shop for genes or special powers. The rest of the game is a very tactical affair that doesn't offer any meaty decisions. Also, turns drag simply because you have to waste time to analyze the board to make a relatively simple decision.

Also, the game gets quite repetitive. There's a limit of how many cards you could accumulate. And even if you have accumulated a lot of cards, players can acquire other cards that counter your powers.

Compare this to Cosmic Encounter, which does this idea of persisting special powers better. The "game" (attacking people and playing higher cards than someone else) is incredibly quick. And there isn't one power that counters another power equally. Players have to co-operate a powerful player. In Ursuppe, this is quite difficult to do since the "game" (drifting, eating other amoeba's poo) is quite random. Also in Ursuppe, although players get more powerful throughout the game, they all get more powerful equally. You don't really have to manage the wonderful imbalances of Cosmic Encounter. In other words, for a game with lots of special powers, it's too balanced! The game balances the game, not the players!

If the rest of the game were more strategically interesting -- or just simply quicker, it would definitely get a higher rating.

this game has what is probably my favorite theme for a game ever. the game may run a tad too long for what it offers, but it still manages to be pretty fun. try to have people familiarize themselves with the genes before playing, if possible. also have people select which genes they want to purchase  before their turn comes up using the very handy reference sheet that comes with the game. that should speed the game up considerably. once everybody has played the game a few times the turns should fly. i love the gene cards and the feeding system. such a clever and fun game.

There is a race to get certain genes, but baring great luck this game is wide open despite getting the "best" genes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Fun game that is limited by both its open-endedness (I have to choose between how many genes??  They each do what again??  overwhelming for those who haven't palyed before) and by its progammed nature (follows very specific and repetitive steps).  Yet, it is fun, but it is a once in a while game, rather than an every session game.

This game has an interesting drift (flow), but it doesn't spawn enough mutations to keep it consistently interesting.  It feels like a bit of the survival of the fittest (a run away leader) kicks in too early.  Still, it's fun.

RATING: 6
Downgraded my rating after a few plays convinced me that this game is a bit dull, and too long for what it offers. I usually prefer "development" games where the gameplay changes as the players build up their assets; in this game one round is much like another, and you are just trying to maintain a good score. In its favor, it's a clever design that is different from anything else in our collection.

RATING: 6.5
Like the game, but do think there are some problems with the rules. Some strange situations can occur when amobas with different genes attack each other. Have resulted in attacks spreading from the amoebas to the players in my gaming group ;o)

Interesting mechanisms, unique in that regard.  Good replayability as you try out different combinations of genes.

RATING: 7
Always enjoyable.  I prefer it with 3 as it gives you some choices during the feeding phase, but works well with 4 players too.  The mindless drift and unavoidable death of amoebas lends a charm to the game, but there is still opportunity for creative play. Can get a bit too "economic-y" at the end where you work out return per BP under various scenarios.

What a clever game!  The game does seem to have its own ecology.  Kill off too many of your opponents and you can't survive.  Be too successful and you are choking in your own waste.  You must succeed with the other simbionts / parisites around you but not too much.
As a bonus, this game gives the feel of real life ecological trade offs!
Get the expansion set but be warned that a number of the expansion powers are not ballanced.  I also would like a more interesting way to choose mutations than the 'pick one from this giant wad of cards' method.  But that problem is easily fixed with some house rules (e.g. deal out 5 random cards to each player and they can pick one. Also they are always allowed to upgrade a power they have.)  I will pick up the English version when it comes out.

We bought the English version and its expansion.  Very nice, but the "players slowly sorting thru a giant wad of cards" problem is even worse with the extra cards.

EDIT: Had a couple of bad games where people were far behind / just not having fun.  Game does seem to run long.  I'm lowering the rating by a point.

We played this in 2009 at UCON.

I enjoyed the heck out of this game, but Mindy hated it.

Possibly on another play through she would change her mind- the other players sort of used her to get points and she ended up the underdog the whole game.

Plus they had played before and we didnt- this always can offset a first play of a game for a new player.

Like I said, I enjoyed it. I would play this again, especially with my strategy gamer friends.

The expansion added a lot to the game too.

For now, Ill say 7.5, but when we play it again that will probably change, I expect it would go up.

Nice - nearly luckless development game.  Theme works well and game while longish, doesn't overstay its welcome.  A nice game to add to the table when a longer lighter strategic game is desired.  Am a bit concerned about a rich-get-richer aspect of the game as if all you amoeba die off - it is hard to re-catch the leaders.

--Apr2006-- Took me a year to find a play.  It's pretty cool.  A bit slow, but still somewhat amusing.  Need more plays to fix a score: 6 or 7, I'd guess.

Too difficult to play this game with my group (only 3 or 4 players) and it just isn't as fun as a lot of my other games.

I don't recommend this game for the average gamer, even though I enjoy it well enough.

This game really sells its theme, and the theme - "we're all amoebas" is often sufficient to sell new players. Everyone always seems to think some particular strategy is unfairly good, but it's usually different strategies ("Spores is unbeatable"). The fact that one mutation probably is actually unfairly good (Ray Protection) and some unclearness in the rules (if I'm trying to eat you and you Escape, can I use Holding to come along and finish eating you?) takes it down a peg, though.

I love it, but for me it has two drawbacks: It's tedious to manage the food cubes when eating and pooping. I think there are some genes which are too cheap for the advantage they give you (esp. Movement 1).

RATING: 8
You eat the crap of other players to survive. So, what to do? Just evolve and start to eat the player's amobae directly. As long as they don't evolve a protection for that... It is just a great game, looks abstract, but is really funny.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Engaging, but doesn't overly impress me. The system is nice, but at no time did I really feel like an amoeba, you know. It's easy to learn and play, the bits are nice, the time flies by and the plays you can make are reasonably interesting in the planning. The scoring seems to push strategy in one direction - keep a steady force of five amoebas and complement them with the available cards you want to develop your game plan around. Leapfrogging opportunities to get past other players on the points track will sometimes determine minor tactical moves during the course of play. A "nice" game, but rather brutal - I've played wargames that were less aggressive and with less killing.

We had great fun in our group, it is unique, and is a believable simulation of some biology concepts. But from a strategy point, the choice of genes at the beginning, which can't be fair because it depends on play order, determines too much of the rest of the game. Half a point for the effect that being able to eat others makes them feed you.

I agree with a lot of people that this game is a bit longer than it should be but it's still a lot of fun. I like the decisions you have to make each turn. There is a lot of time spent fiddling with pieces and when some players can take a long time on their turns, but the gene combinations and the way the amoebas more around and eat/poo food cubes is really interesting. It's essentially an epic abstract game though. If it played in half the time I would probably rate this a 9.

This game was extremely fun. The amoeba theme is clever and the "simulation" carried out by gameplay is very unique.

Holy Playtesting Batman! Someone must have sat around the table for days on end when testing this one. So many choices with the ability cards yet so well balanced. A little fiddly with the pooping dynamic but fun fun. Would like to play again.

7/25 - Played again (finally!) but this time with 4 players. It was much easier to teach this time around and everyone who played had fun. The strategies in this one seem limitless with the different combination of cards. Just wondering if PERSISTANCE isn't too powerful and perhaps should have an MP of 6 v. 4. Regardless, brilliant.

This is a good game, but it's a bit long for what it is in order to elevate to a great game; it perhaps is best to have fewer points be the default for victory (or at least when playing with new players).  On the plus side, the interplay of the different amoebas and their advances is really cool.  On the downside, there seem to be a couple of key advances that unbalance the game.  I would like to play it again, which is always a good sign.

Definitely one of the most interesting concepts for a game.  It takes while to learn the rules and all the different genetic possibilities, so I played twice with the same four people.

Lo resumo como "la caca de uno, es el alimento de otro". Me encanta este juego (me lo hice con amebas hechas con pasta de modelar). Su único problema es el tiempo que toma, pues la fase de elegir genes se alarga mucho, sobre todo si juegas con personas que no lo conocen.

Time may not have been kind for Ursuppe, which starts to look more old-fashioned by the day. But dated or not, this is still a lot of fun to play.

Players control amoebae floating in the primordial soup, dividing, eating, pooping and dying. There's a nice balance between acquiring favourable genes (get stronger) and placing more pieces.

It's pleasantly brutal -- more death than some wargames! -- and the different genes all seem overpowered in different ways, resulting in interesting opportunities for combinations. The combination of length and randomness knocks it down a point, for me, but otherwise a great game. Pieces are a little abstract and ugly.

A great game that rewards careful planning, yet has enough random elements that it does not seem to become formulamatic.  Seems like there are limited strategies for winning, but just enough everyone to have aviable chance of winning.  Play time seems about right at 120 minutes or so.

Update Dec 2007, just played this again, this is a great game. Funny given thematically it's about amoebas.  It helps to say "eats one yellow, one grean, one red, and craps two ...."  Regardless, it is a terrific design, that is well balanced, and plays relatively quickly.

I like the theme, it is fun to buy different abilities. Gameplay is rather chaotic. Due to how the scoring system works it is very difficult to catch up if you fall behind, and then it will be boring. Also, the first time you play you need to spend quite a lot of time reading about the different abilities.

Igra se čini skroz ok, po pravilima, po izgledu, po svemu. Ipak, svaki put se dogodi da partija skolabira u par ćelija punih dreka/klope i ogromnu pustinju svugdje okolo. Ako i je do našeg groupthinka, veliki minus što se čini da postoji točan način kako održati balans, a sve mimo je krivo. Dakle nažalost baš i nije sandbox - postoji određena dinamika koja se mora postići, ili će stvar skrenuti u krivo. No ima prijedlog kućnih pravila: ne bira se iz cijelog špila nego se izvuku 4 karte pa se bira među njima. Em ograniči izbor em ubrza fazu mutiranja jer se špil može razdijeliti pa ljudi rade paralelno (a ne serijski kao sada, jel...)

On a first play through, this is quick, simple and fun with some nasty little tricks that you can pull off. The scoring is almost too close (actually, no. It *is* too close), so it seems almost impossible to pull away from other plays through your good play, you require bad play from them.

It hasn't quite stood the test of time, but it's still very playable.

Update: Actually, I take it back. Everything in the game works well and the game really develops differently based on the genes that people take. It's possibly a little harsh sometimes if one player ends up being hunted (Struggle for Survival & Movement 2 for example) and doesn't have the genes to defend themselves, but I guess the counter to that is that the game genuinely rewards good play and punishes poor play...

Tough rating.  I like this one, and I think, the times I've brought it to Game Night, that my opponents have really enjoyed it too.  However, when I'm thinking games that take four players, it seems like this just has a really weird pacing to it.  Points come quite slowly compared to the number required to win, and the last few turns seem repetitive.

This could almost be an abstract, except that there are variable powers that players can "purchase" to upgrade their pieces. Probably this is best with the expansion and 4-5 players. The design of the game attempts to force player interactions (you feed of the um... "remains" (ok poop) of the other players - so you have to follow each other around to survive), so you can't just hide out, but I'm not sure if the powers are balanced enough or not. AND, this is another bash the leader game...

Plays well, but very differently, with 3 or 4 players. There are some killer combinations of genes, so watch out for the more experienced players! Update: Back in the late '90s when this first came out, it got quite a bit of play. Now, it languishes on the shelf. It's still interesting and pretty balanced, and the bits, even if not exactly thematic, are terrific. But I think this is just a bit too long for what it is. It's a close call, as this game has actually held up fairly well over the years, but I think it now goes on the trade pile to make way for more evolved games.

The shining concept in Primordial Soup is the tide deck.  So many of our games depend upon fighting for control, but Primordial Soup can be won just by drifting about and consuming what is left behind by others.  There is something charming in that.  Primordial Soup fires the imagination about the origins of life, although not so much about ITSELF.  That's almost educational game territory, but Primordial Soup works and it's fun.  You can see a little piece of god on the board.

The epic struggle of the amoeba. Hilarious! It's sort of the Twilight imperium for the microcosm with all those genes your amoeba can evolve over the time.

Awesome theme and great art and gene ideas.  
It's charm and replayability is in how each game you can try a different combination of genes which means a very different strategy for winning.  There is delicate balance in one player's strategy countering another.
The only negative about this game is maintaining the cubes and the rules; offset by an observant teacher who knows the rules cold and can catch mistakes.

I showed my list to Valerie’s husband and he kindly offered to teach me Primordial Soup, which is a Doris & Frank game that I’d been wanting to learn for a while. I know that the Geek suggests the game is best with 4 players, but I’m glad we played with only 3 because it moved along very quickly and I’ve heard that the game can often drag and take too long for what it is. I enjoyed the game at the pace it went and am now tempted to pick up a copy, but it’s a bit quirky and am unsure how much table time it would see, particularly given the crowded field of 90 minute three-player games (e.g., La Citta, Java, Reef Encounter, Extrablatt, Le Havre, Tikal, Goa, Age of Steam, Age of Empires, Tigris & Euphrates). I’m glad I learned the game though and would be more than happy to play it again. Primordial Soup is reminiscent of Evo in that it’s a game where you’re buying amusing upgrades for your units to give them special abilities and then moving them around the map in an effort to survive and prosper. You score points for having a large number of units on the map at any given time and a large number of special ability cards, and the game is simply a race to score points and reach the end of the VP track. The clever mechanic of the game is that each space starts with two cubes of every color and that on your turn your units need to eat two cubes of one opponent color and one cube of the other opponent color, and then they produce two of your own color as waste, so the distribution of colored cubes on the map is slowly but distinctly shifting. The trick is trying to move to where your units can eat in order to avoid taking damage and ultimately dying. The game is somewhat slowed down by the fact that there are numerous special ability cards available for purchase and all of them are available to the players on their turn to choose from which can paralyze you with vast options, as in a number of Wallace games, such as Struggle of Empires and Rise of Empires.

[thing=124][/thing] surprised me in a positive manner. The gameplay is solid and the interaction between players is high. The humor in the cards and basically in the situation (eating the poop of others) can get old, but since we usually play a game with a big hiatus between plays, this isn't really an issue.

Overall, a nice game, that I can laugh while I try to win.

[Rated 2005/05/06, based on 1 play]

The 'eat, excrete, die' mechanism is excellent, and the ebb and flow of colours across the board as the game progresses really make the whole thing feel underwater.  (I want to grab the next game as a series of digital photos and make a stop-motion movie of it, I think it would look cool).

Nice artwork on the board and cards, and the fact that 'intelligence' as a trait has no benefits had everyone in fits.

The turn sequence is rather fiddly, at least to start with, and with all first-timers the game took *way* too long.  If the playing time comes down a bit with experience, it should see some more plays.

Finally got to play this gem, and found I LOVE it! It is a game type I claim to dislike in that best play requires exact knowledge of how cards work, and which ones work best together, but in this game it doesn't seem that complicated, and could easily be well understood after a few plays. Z-Man bits are nice, and play is very interactive. I love the artwork.

The Primordial Soup is supposedly where all life came from. Players take charge of a tribe of amoeba as they struggle to survive. In order to help their quest, tribes will take various genetic advantages, which allow them to 'break' the rules of life. For instance, instead of going hungry, your amoeba could learn to attack foreign amoeba for food. Or perhaps your amoeba could be taught to need less food to survive. Either way, this is a very interesting take on the game of life.

This game might have been fantastic when it was first released. It was/is certainly original, and still looks great. However, anno 2008 we have been spoiled with better games. Great games like Agricola offer more choices for the same game length and, especially, shorter turns. Now I find that Ursuppe has too much downtime in between turns for me to really enjoy it. In some cases, the active player has to roll movement dice for each of his amoeba's before the next player needs to do the same. If that is the case, the game will definitely drag. Also, my first game had a bit of a runaway leader problem. Or at least, our position on the points track remained the same for the last 2 thirds of the game!

RATING: 7
Taught by Zev at PrezCon 05.  This is a very interesting game, but it was not quite what I expected.  Given the graphics of the game, I was expecting something light, but it is actually a very thoughtful and fairly aggressive game.  It has a touch of luck, but if you don't want to rely on luck, choose genes that let you ignore it.<br/><br/>In fact, however you want to play, aggressively, defensively, or slyly, you should be able to find a combination of genes to suit.  You probably shouldn't get too attached to any one playing style, because if you don't react to the other player's genes, you are going starve or be lunch meat.  This is not multiplayer solitaire.<br/><br/>I went in to the game expecting to love it because it was cute.  I came out feeling a little brutalized, but intrigued.  I don't think I quite got an accurate feel for the game, and it is expensive enough that I am not going to just to learn more, but I really look forward to trying it again.

Grow, feed, and evolve your amoebas in the primordial soup while chuckling at poop jokes. Unique and highly thematic eurogame - especially fun for a molecular biologist! The genes/ozone mechanisms are cleverly implemented and several paths to victory seem available through different gene set specializations. The only flaw is that the game seems to drag a little long after the 4th or 5th rounds until the end - while seeming prone to a runaway leader phenomenon. Maybe needs a variant balancing game length while providing enough rounds for interesting gene combos to come into play? I was toying with the idea of changing the scoring schedule (1 pt per gene + 1 pt per amoeba starting with the 1st as opposed to the 3rd as it is now).

Really cool example of modeling done in a board game.  The game will tend to develop like the real evolution of organisms.  The traits that you can obtain are much like those that organisms at this level have developed, and they fit together in patterns that make sense.  If you're a predator, it generally pays to be motive, so that you can move from place to place.  If you plan to harvest food (a la photosynthesis), then you probably want to make sure you refine your food process to be more flexible or more efficient.  And if every player gets together and congregates in one spot, you can form a very robust ecosystem, where people won't starve for quite a while, and when people DO starve, the rest of the colony will integrate their remains into the ecosystem, and it will correct itself.  Very neat.

It is sort of a reverse pick-up-and-deliver game, it is move eat (and excrete).  Heh.  Who can't have fun with pooping amoebas?  Fun game, good but not great.  Fairly straight forward.  It has some screwage with certain gene abilities.

I'm so excited we have found our missing copy of this game. I like that a new player can play this game and still have a chance at winning, and that there is no ultimate strategy. you must adapt your tactics each time you play this game, even if you prefer certain cars over another.

RATING: 5.5
The theme is very clever and amusing and also well executed but this game is way too long which makes it repetitive and not that interesting. Basically, the strategy is to hoard money in the beginning of the game and buy up all the good card combinations to set yourself up to win during the second half of the game. If this game was shorter, I may have enjoyed it more but the length kind of killed it for me.

Primordial Soup is unique and engrossing. The consumption mechanic is really neat and creates an interesting dynamic where you need other players to be in close proximity in order to be able to eat their excretions, yet you are also competing with them both indirectly through competition for scarce resources and directly by attacks and other special abilities conferred by the cards. The cards themselves are a great strategic menu that always keeps me wanting to play again to try out something different. My only quibble with the game is that the physical upkeep is non-trivial and can get a bit repetitive, but that's not enough to keep me from loving this game.

Hm.  What to think?  It's almost a perfect-information game, but with the die rolls and the environment cards, it adds too much chaos.  It involves some spatial planning, but can completely muck with your plans through the gene cards.  And because the gene cards correlate with each other, it means that anyone who is experienced with the game will kick butt against those unfamiliar with it.  I'd try it again, but only against people with the same experience level.

The Primordial Soup is supposedly where all life came from. Players take charge of a tribe of amoeba as they struggle to survive. In order to help their quest, tribes will take various genetic advantages, which allow them to 'break' the rules of life. For instance, instead of going hungry, your amoeba could learn to attack foreign amoeba for food. Or perhaps your amoeba could be taught to need less food to survive. Either way, this is a very interesting take on the game of life.

RATING: 6
The concept of this game is fascinating. Players try to exert control over a closed ecosystem of amoebas that consume food and then poop, which then becomes food for the other amoebas...who then, in turn, poop to feed the original amoebas again. This is clever, but what makes the game pop are the evolution cards that allow players to power up their amoebas, allowing them to attack other amoebas for food, carry food with them or find food more efficiently. These evolutions are non-random, giving players complete control over how to evolve their own particular species. This makes the game a little slow until players get familiar with the available adaptations, but once that happens play tends to flow easily enough. It's a very unique design and I wish I had owned it back when it first released. I don't think it is quite as interesting as Dominant Species or BIOS Megafauna, so I probably won't get as much play out of it as I would have when those games didn't exist.

Enjoyable petri-dish sort of experience.  Clearly somewhat deep, but awfully slow-paced and processional. I think the dolphin strategy is too strong, creating a mainline that is a bit too tough to deviate from for my liking.

Update: After coming back to this one, it's just too dang slow! Not sure how this will get played going forward. Fantastic art, humor, and concept. Cumbersome play.

Genetics!  Board and amoeba tokens are a bit minimalist,  but being able to buy upgrades was fun.  Only play was pretty long - didn't finish(!) (played once) - could have some downtime issues with 4.

A little long - should probably definitely cut the game down and end at a lower point total?  But we had tons of fun having the amoeba go hunting for food.

Not sure about this one. I did like it but found it quite dry and quite abstract, and possibly too long. I can see that with more plays I may like it better cos knowing how the cards is paramount.  I love the artwork on the BOX and I also liked being able to say poo all night!  What I want to do is to play it again and see how it goes.  So 7 is a temporary rating, unless I don't get to play again.

To be honest, I expected this to be a flop with my g/f when I saw all the text on the Gene cards. I know she doesn't like to read much text on cards during a game. And 2hours of playing time- uff.
I was wrong. The game was a big hit with everyone in our group. It's really funny, you can be mean yet no one gets angry because it happens so inevitably and can never be considered "backstabbing". The drawings add lots of  flair to the game.
A great game.

First game was an instant hit. Once the knowledge of cards and possible combos become clear, the game is really captivating. Second game was equally compelling with jostling for first place between all players..no-one ever really being out of contention! 3rd game was a very more aggressive game with 2 players choosing the 'eating gene'..I really like this game

UPDATE: I think the length of the game is the ONE factor that stops this hitting the table as much as it should, and holds it back from being as enjoyable as it could be as after several hours people can get over the repetition of the game and just want it to end.

Who would have ever thought that eating and pooping could be so much fun?

There is a wide variety of different strategies and combos, and what works in one game might fail miserably in the next.  You can tell they playtested the hell out of this game because no matter how good of a combo you think you have, something can still beat it.

The components are all very high-quality, and except for the board and cards everything is made of wood.  This is the first game I've ever encountered where the setup section recommends the use of a hammer - and they mean it too!  Also, if you love wooden cubes, you'll find more in this game than almost any other.

Brilliant game stuffed with innovations.  First boardgame i have needed a hammer to put together!  Evolve your creatures - but not too far or the radiation costs you too much.  be prepared to drop evolutions in order to take on others.  Others eat your excretions, dunno why I find that so amusing but I do!  The artwork on the cards is excellent, and the expansion adds great new dimensions - the Doris and Frank evolution for instance, which does nothing in this game but adds means the owner of this card gets to choose the next game to play!
Only criticism is that it can be slightly fiddly, and 'food' blocks can easily be knocked into the wrong place.  dont jog the board!

Great game! Primordial Soup is hilarious, thinky, treacherous and fun. A great combination of elements and a great , infrequently used theme make for a very fun time playing in small groups of folks who aren't afraid to make endless poop jokes. "Move. Eat. Poop"- that's essentially the game, and it's done very well!

Thoroughly enjoyable. I love the various combinations of the different genes and the way that seemingly unstoppalbe gene combos can be countered by other correct combination. Our group's play has definitely evolved: first, Struggle for Survival was the best gene, but counters were learned, then counter-counters, etc. Not so fiddly as others may complain if you are organized and focused.

I'd like to play with 4 players (both other games were 3) before final rating.

A 3-4 player, evolving, survival, amoeba game where players multiply their amoebas and evolve them to defeat and out-last other player's amoebas.

Excellent strategy game with hilarious theme. Players will have to manage their amoebas carefully to get the most points possible while moving around the board eating each other's poop! Very quick and easy to teach!

Used, and in mint condition.

This is a really fun little game.  It actually simulates the struggle for survival pretty well, so you should take that into consideration if you are thinking about this game.  While there are some interesting tactical (and maybe a few strategic) decisions to be made, don't expect any grand overarching ones in the game.  The point is to survive!  Thus gameplay is a little chaotic, but that is the point (keep that in mind and you will have lots of fun).  The bits are really nice and there are nice tweakable factors in the game to keep it from getting stale (ie, you can change game length, or add your own genes).

For all the fluff and cuteness of the theme, the game doesn't really offer anything.

1. Plays way too long for something this light.
2. Too many text to memorise, reading during play really drag the the downtime.
3. There isn't much strategy involved.
4. Luck factor is high. the game is a roll-and-move kind and it can screw you big times.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Fun theme and light game play that makes it easy to play with non-gamers.

The amoeba pieces are nice and the size of the board itself makes it easy to see moves and keep everything from becoming a mess. However, there is simply a massive amount of cube "accounting" that goes on making the game feel sluggish.

That said, the game is light enough that you can chat and joke around between your moves and not get confused or forget your grand strategy.

Wow did I enjoy my first play of this game!  The balancing act of whether to spend energy growing more ameobas or evolving the species is very challenging and the "random movement" felt very strategic.

RATING: 6.5
Fun concept with an irreverant take on the evolutionary process.  Even with just one play under my belt, it seems as if the game will always fall into 3 dominant archetypes: the aggressive ones that susbsist on the others to survive; the frugal ones that can live on less than what they make; and the highly reproductive ones that pop up as fast as they are destroyed.  While I imagine each would be a different experience to play as, but I do wonder whether the game would remain compelling after you've become familiar with them.

I really love the gameplay of Primordial Soup, but I think it has some of the worst components I've seen. I really like the multitude of options for evolution and the flow of gameplay in the way amoebas move.

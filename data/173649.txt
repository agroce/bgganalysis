8/16: Not as interesting as I had originally thought. There are only so many levers to pull, and the incentive manipulation isn't as clever as I would like. Downgraded to a 6.

2/16: Impressive. Takes the tile-laying of Ingenious and turns it into a logistics game with incentive manipulation.

The 3-player game felt a bit too open. We were either able to supply ourselves over multiple links or create neutral areas that bridged the gap. I think the 4-player game will alleviate this problem, as the same number of tiles are placed, but there are four additional meeples on the map.

Still trying to figure out if it's more efficient to have multiple steps in a row to supply yourself or to create a symbiotic relationship with another player.

2015. 2-5p. 45-60 min. Abstract, tile pl, semi-area control game of economics efficiency and supply chain management. One of the main tricks is that you have only 4 meeples for control and there are 6 levels of production so you cannot run your own supply chain 100% unless you move meeples and thus relinquish ownership of a potentially valuable group of hexes.

Others say: king-making/avoid the leader; there's no incentive to go to move your cubes to one person's field versus the other unless you think one person is leading or you make deals, but this isn't supposed to be a deal-making game.  Paying actions to draw a tile is annoying because the result is you only get 2, not 3, actions per turn.  You cannot tell who is winning.  It has feelings of the game Ingenious where you don't want to set someone up, and you can purposefully make a chain to nowhere to avoid creating juicy groups of like hexes.

King Chocolate is brilliant! It's a supply chain game that can be taught in 5 minutes but provides a huge amount of space to play in. 

Players are trying to create chocolate starting at level 1 of the supply chain and going all the way to level 6. As an action, players can move all cubes of one product from one production facility to another. Whoever owns the "selling" production facility gets 1 VP per cube. If no one owns the "selling" facility, the player moving the goods gets the points. Players get 3 action points each turn and use them for movement of cubes and ownership markers, and for getting new tiles. 

The tiles are the brilliant part of the game. Players start with 3 tiles behind their screen. Each round begins with a player placing one. While they can skip getting a replacement once in a while, they must use APs at some point or lose a turn. The tiles are two connected hexags and allow players to form or grow production facilities. This simple mechanic creates the depth as players try to either enlarge their own facilities, block off other players' facilities from being enlarged or create new facilities to compete with other players' monopoly on a particular level's production. So simple but it creates so much gameplay.

Although I've only played it once and my opinion might change, I'm really optimistic about King Chocolate. If it holds up to repeated plays and different player counts, it's got a chance at fighting for game of the year as well.

RATING: 7
One play. The game is rules light, but there is a need for planning and evaluating scoring opportunities through careful tiling laying, and taking advantage of area control (production in the factories). Players also have to at times make scoring moves that will net some points to your opponent. Nicely done medium weight game.

RATING: 6
A decent game of setting up production chains to make chocolate but the idea is so abstract that the theme could really be about anything. The rules are simple but offer a lot of tough decisions as you play in order to make the most out of your turn. Since you only have 4 workers you can place on the board and there are 6 steps in the chain you are forced to help your opponent by making moves that will help them but must provide a better benefit to you. This is definitely more a gamers game due to the abstract nature of gameplay and for my taste lasts a little too long for what it is. I would play it again, but not one I would suggest.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very neat and elegant shared incentive game that actually works for two players.  The game is about identifying and controlling choke-points in the production cycle, but if you make yourself too much of a monopoly, you are going to sink yourself.  This is a game about cornering markets, but doing so in the most non-obtrusive way as possible to keep yourself $1 ahead of your closest competition.

I was surprised by the strategic elements present in the game, as the instructions make it sound like a typical min/max type Euro.  You've got to try to target where you want to dictate the temp in production.  However, your plans will have to adapt to the players around you, as they may choose to take the long-end around to avoid your monopolies.  Therefore you must balance controlling the game with giving your opponents a tangible benefit for moving through your chain.  This has a very "Container"-like feel to it, which is one of the reasons it has struck such a chord with me.

My minor complaints are that the 2 player game can run a little long.  Those that suffer from AP may want to be wary, and this game is definitely not for you if you want a thematic experience.

The game has become less fun for me. My gaming partner has found a strategy in the 2 player game that makes it damn nigh impossible to defend against and makes the game feel like it plays out the same all of the time. Defending or blocking is horribly difficult in the 2 player game to begin with, and as fun as it was when we'd first started I'm not interested in plumbing the depths much further than I have in the last several games. So while I'd play this again, as I still think it's quite an interesting game, definitely only with more players and I'd have to be in the mood for it. Traded.

A tile placement game about the production chain economics of the chocolate manufacturing process. On your turn you must first place a tile, then use up to 3 action points to draw tiles, move workers, produce through the six stages of chocolate (you only have 4 workers) - you would move all cubes of one product from one production facility to the next stage up. The rules are short and simple and it feels like a cross between Ingenious and Tikal where you want to grow the area so you can profit but not so much that your competitor finds it attractive or can expand it, plus the nail biting tension of how to use your 3 APs whether to produce, or move a worker to capitalise on the anticipated actions of your opponent (timing is crucial!), but no you can't cuz you need more tiles...aargh...sweet! A very interesting and very engaging game - time just flew by. 

However, board layout looks very busy and it's sometimes hard to identify where something should go, feels very much like an abstract but we love abstracts anyway so that doesn't bother us, your tiles and coins are hidden behind screens so people who like to keep track of these elements in a game and know exactly how they are doing compared to everybody else will not like it – I suppose you could play without the screens but in Big Business do you really know how much your competition is making in real life? Still not sure about the timing mechanism (the game ends when the 4 tiles on display can no longer be refilled from the draw pile) – in a higher player game you can be screwed over if you do not get to draw in time, in a 2 player game it can run a little bit long and I fear that once we get more efficient we might end up “doing stuff just to do stuff” until the game runs out. It should be fairly easy to take out a number of tiles and put them back in the box unseen which would a) make for a shorter game and b) ensure you don't know exactly what tiles are out in the game and if you can count on specific ones to show up.

A literal Euro cube pusher.

King Chocolate is a vastly underrated game. I suspect the reasons for this are its initial price point ($40-$50) and the fact that it's not very pretty. I remember first learning of it via Tom Vasel's "Everything is Awesome" review and he and his friend disliked it immensely. However, their description outlined a game that hit on may of the qualities that I appreciate: non-obvious play, shared-incentives, transient alliances. The game is definitely not for everyone, but if you like a game of subtle (and constant) trade-off analyses then you might like it as I have.

Great supply-chain economic game with just a few rules.

The production values for this one are low, as is typical with Mayfair games, but game itself is quality. Every turn players place a tile and then use 3 action point points to do any combination of placing a worker, moving a worker, drawing a tile, or producing. The domino-like tiles show a different step in the production chain on each side. Players try to group together the same production steps into areas and use workers to claim ownership of a production area. When a player produces, they can move one group of cubes from one area to another, with the owner of the area that the cubes leave getting one point for each. With areas of different sizes and open spaces, it may be that not all cubes can move. Finding efficient moves (and setting up the means to do them) is what the game is about. Because players need cubes on their production areas in order to make points, often someone else will remove your cubes for you! This is the best way to make points, leaving your turn free to take an additional action. Of course, players can also get creative in finding ways to NOT give you cubes while still generating points other ways - or give cubes to another player's production area, so sometimes you need to pull the cubes in, which will give others the points on your turn.

Nicely interactive and just variable and abstract enough to ensure a high level of replayability. Can lead to high levels of AP, so it also needs the right audience to shine.

UPDATE: Lowered rating to a 6. Just no real desire to play. Maybe we're not the right audience?

RATING: 6
Chocolate is produced through six production steps. In each of the steps, the intermediate good has to be moved to the next production step, given that space is available on this level. Players earn money for each goods cube that leaves their area. The twist is that each player only has four meeples to claim production areas. Thus, cooperation is necessary to finish the chocolate.

King Chocolate is a subtle game of finding the niche in the production chain with the least competition. This will be something else each game. A quasi-monopoly will force other players to work for you as well, giving you money on their actions. Fine enough game but too subtle and reduced for its own good failing to wow me.

RATING: 7
FIRST IMPRESSION:

Typical cheap feel to the components with chippy cardboard and odd choice of colors/graphic design which just looks ugly from my perspective. Just why? Take a page from the Lookout book and make games that look enticing for a change with higher quality chits (in other words, not sprues where you have to be very careful not to rip the chits when punching!). 

Game play is very interesting...and quite simple although timing is everything. I've only played a five player game and I am not certain this game is good at that number - it would definitely take some jiggering to make the timing work to my benefit being the last player... The game ends immediately when the tile display can no longer be filled meaning that everyone may not have an equal number of turns. That doesn't bother me, but I know it is something that others dislike - hence the warning. There is potential for nastiness, incentivizing, etc in this one depending on how people choose to play. If you're not paying attention, you can certainly hand the victory to someone on a platter. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
This game is a hit in my larger gaming circle. Fun to negotiate with friends about the supply chain since you can't hit every tier yourself. Horrible color palette and graphic design though. What were they thinking? Did they really have to use roman numerals -- that no one can read -- in a game where you need to constantly assess cube movement to the next highest numbered spot? Despite this, I really like the game mechanics and enjoy playing it.

RATING: 9
I don't understand the hate for this game.  It looks gorgeous, and it does a better job of representing the struggle between Vertical and Horizontal integration in manufacturing.  The fact that the designers forced players to only be able to control a limited aspect of the production chain, they are forced to cooperate with others.  

At least in the short term.

This game can slow down a bit if people aren't quick with their arithmetic, as players don't normally want to take an action that gives more points to another player than it does to themselves (though this can be valid if the other player is in last, and indeed is one of the balancing acts if the last place player can position themselves counter to the leader).  Barring truly poor basic math skills, this game flows quickly and feels very deep.

RATING: 7
Rating based on 5 players.

A bit of a weird one, but I am intrigued. This is a game with very straightforward rules that simply provides a framework in which the players interact. The players provide the balance, but most of the interaction is positive in nature.

The game looks very pretty, but it does look a bit chaotic and simple things like using numerals instead of hash marks would have helped with that. Partly for that reason, I suspect it plays better with four.

This is one of those games that will go out of print and become a cult classic. Simple to play but not simple to play well.

Here's a quite clever little game where each player is attempting to earn the most money trough guiding cacao beans thorough the production cycle to have it turned into chocolate. Thing is though that it's not possible to control all production stages so there are some difficult decisions to be made - usually around who you help. Like most games with this mechanic this can lead to 'kingmaking'.

The components are nice and the modular board should be good for replayability but this game just didn't grab me.

King Chocolate plays 2-5; my only game was with five and, sad to say, it wasn't great. That's not to say it was terrible but with five there was just too much downtime. Other then that, not a bad game which played okay.

Not one I'd buy but I might play again with four or less.

Tile laying game where players use their 3 action points per turn in an attempt to move chocolate through the six stages of production. You want to control all aspects of the production, but you can't... so you'll need to at least partially rely on your opponents. Seems best with more than 2p.

From numerous geekbuddy comments, this is supposedly Container lite. That instantly had my interests piqued. After a couple plays, I can definitely see the comparison. It isn't perfect, obviously, but it's there. I found the game really opens up when you have more than 2 players. A constant struggle of who to help and how you can go about helping yourself more. It's much more thought provoking then the rules let on. I found the theme to be minimal yet still there, just barely.

I just wanted to mention a rules question I had here to clarify it in future rules readings:

You must end your turn with a tile, so effectively you have at least 2 actions, 3 if you don't spend time drawing a tile. But if you manage to break the rule of the "must", you suffer a penalty during your next turn drawing 2 tiles, playing one and ending your turn immediately. I don't know if you can intentionally do it or if it's more of a "sucks to be you" penalty, but it's probably not good either way. Who knows?

What was I thinking getting this game for me (I think it was an article in Spielbox that convinced me) as it involves tile-laying and for those who know me, that is not my favorite genre/mechanism :s?

I really wanted to try this one out because I kept seeing it around the online stores but never really knowing much about it. It is an abstract production game. My table that played it absolutely hated it. 2/4 players stopped playing so then Ron and I ended up calling it since it was stupid to continue. I didn't hate it quite like everyone else but the fact they all hated it didn't help me with my rating either. I would try it again to be fair, but I don't think that will ever happen if I am being honest. I wanted to like it.

King Chocolate is a new release but it feels like an old-school Euro (that's a compliment). Only a couple of pages of rules, a central spatial play area and unavoidable interaction puts it right in my wheelhouse. The idea is that you're managing a six-stage production chain, but you can only control a maximum of four links in that chain. That means using other players' facilities (and thereby giving them points) is a central part of the game, which becomes all about incentives and timing to maximise flow through your plants.

I've played with three people, and while I'm interested in how King Chocolate scales up, I think three was the perfect number.  I can see this game getting much too chaotic with more people, or far too simple with fewer.

KC is a wonderful little tile laying and engine creation game, with the genius twist that players vie for control over various production segments of a shared engine, and thus have a shared incentive to work together while fighting for individual success.

Very thoughtful, intensely strategic, and simple to teach.

Fantastic. This seems like it'll be a dry, calculative exercise, but it turns out to be a subtle, deeply strategic game about feeling out and predicting where the market is going, where the bottlenecks will be and where the over-supplied areas are, about keeping your options open. The mesh of geometry, tactics, and subtle strategy and manipulation is just lovely.

It's not a small-scale calculation game. It's a game of feeling out where the supply chain is bulging and where it's running dry, of trying to feel o and wrestle with this weird, live, wriggling angry python of thing

tl;dr: average tile laying game

Lay some tiles, claim some fields, upgrade some resources and get money. Very basic stuff. A bit too basic if you ask me. Yes, there can be some competition for certain resources or space on the board, but I just didn't find this engaging.
The second time I played I decided to nor rely on other players and just build my own chain. At the end of my chain I would be giving resources to other players for them to score. I didn't care, by that time I had already scored them 4 times! I won big. Now I'm not saying this is a guaranteed win, but I just never felt like the game challenged me. Every turn you score as much as possible, or set yourself up for a good next turn.
Also, this game has a weird rule. It has a rule that if you start your turn without a tile, you take 2 and play one, keep one. It also tells you that if you have no tiles after placing one, you HAVE to use an action to take one. Weird!
In any case... I found this game works. It's not annoying but maybe a tad long and not very engaging and there aren't a ton of strategies to explore.

From a recent comment I posted to the Heavy Cardboard Guild:

"Personally, I find it to be a slow-burn of a game. Repeat plays show great improvement, especially if you can find a group of players to wrangle for repeat sessions. The game moves much faster, with management of the endgame being a key skill. I've never been one to fear hidden information, and it was never a problem for me personally with King Chocolate. Judging the board state was typically a good indicator of who was in the lead anyway. So I like it! I still need more plays under my belt to decide what sort of legs the game has."

I can see this one rising to an 8 if things progress as I hope they do.

I love Container, and this provides something of the feel of Container in a more accessible package. Most days I'd prefer to play this as its quicker and a *little* less opaque.

So yeah I love this game too. Emergent alliances, negotiation, groupthink and even sabotage, laid over a delicate tactical game about positioning and  tempo in the chocolate production chain.

Wow. I am finding reasons to not make this a 10 other than it has a learning curve, but that's not the fault of the game.
I am not a fan of abstracts --- but I really liked this game. Mayfair has a winner here.

Abstract cocoa cube pusher with action points to place paired-hex colored region tiles, move cocoa (at the risk of scoring for another player), and placing area control meeples.

Interesting game where you almost are guaranteed to have to help one of the other players in order to score points for yourself.

Its "The Supply Chain" game! A very abstract economic game about owning part of a supply chain and doing your best to keep cubes flowing through it for points. Not for everyone, but if you're into the dry end of economic games and don't mind a lot of kingmaking type moves as you decide who to work with and who to mess with as you move cubes around the board I think there is a neat little game to be had here.  I'm certainly looking forward to seeing how the game changes as my group gains experience with it.

Intense, calculating, manipulative game. There's much more to it than the looks portray, but the chocolate theme is not carried through as richly as it could be. The game looks good, but the good looks don't soak the theme into the fairly abstract mechanisms. Still, solid, good game!

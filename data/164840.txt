RATING: 8
Fun game, but we think it gets over too fast, so we changed some of the rules to make it last longer.

RATING: 6.2
I know this looks like a cheap card game version of a game which spits out versions of itself for endless cash grabbing. I mean, it is that, but they accidentally created a pretty fun family game. It works best with 3 or 4 players. It's very fast. Like 5 minutes per round.

Better than the board game.  Quicker, simple to teach, and there is a bit of strategy beyond just drawing cards.

:star::star::star::star::nostar::nostar::nostar:; Monopoly Deal is far superior to regular monopoly. It's quick and offers a neat little decision tree. In my experience the first player has an advantage but that might not be as big a problem overall.

Both the 5-player version and the Morrisons "Lite" 2-3 player version
Finally got round to giving the latter a whirl with 2, and was suprised that we both wanted to go again.

Munchkin-styled fast and furious gameplay without the hour-long games Munchkin can spawn. A good way to play Monopoly (surprising, I know).

The "light" version, which I purchased by mistake thinking it was the full version, is horribly balanced and doesn't really work.

A surprise hit! I played this game with some hardcore gamers and we've really enjoyed it. It's quick and fun. Play your cards wisely and have enough money in the bank. Give this game a try.

Dude, it's just awesome. Look, I know it's a simple card game based on a board game everyone considers hot garbage but fuck, it's fun and fast.

Manic, Luck fest, and for the most part void of strategy with some cards that are way too powerful, but i play this often enough and for a reason i can't quite explain enjoy it.

Best monopoly game ever.
Simple, quick, some strategy involved, 
and extremely affordable.
Great value for the price.
I play with my 7 & 11 years old & they enjoy it thoroughly

Monopoly Deal is a great game that everyone in my family loves to play. It is very well balanced and you can play it very quickly (10-20 mins) which allows for many plays per sit. It is simple but cuthroat and fun and an awesome game no matter how many people you play with. I personally like playing with 5 but my wife and I playing alone is great as well. I give it a 10 because my family loves to play it with me and will ask to play it without me bringing it up. It's great and especially for the price, is very worth it.

WOW!

Based on good reviews here at the geek I purchased this game, which was $5 at the time.  

Sat on it for 3-4 years before finally playing....and was blown away.
Granted part of that is not expecting much, as this is a Monopoly game, but it turns out it is a lot of fun. 
Plays very quick and you will find yourself immediately wanting to play again.  
The game can be very swingy, especially with the card that steals a complete set, however, in 15 minutes - who cares?

Buy it!

Tolerable filler, I suppose. But there isn't much game there and to me it just seemed like the decisions were far too obvious.

I bought this game before I played my gateway game. At the time I thought it was a fun game, it still is. It's nothing like the real monopoly game. After experiencing better games, I don't think I can go back to playing this. It's a quick card game, nothing more, nothing less.

It's a nice different game to monopoly - but in the end the luck seems relatively high and it feels like there's a runaway leader issue if someone gets ahead. It says it plays very short, but in the games we played it was a long longer than 15 minutes.

The mechanics are nothing like the board game. Very random but good filler.

RATING: 7
This Morrisons 'lite' version is only for 2-3 players and contains about half the number of cards as the full version. It is still fun but the rules are less detailed (so house ruling may be needed for certain situations) and a stalemate situation is possible as I found out today. 

If you like it, it is definitely worth upgrading to the complete game, which can be bought for only a few pounds and plays up to 5 if I remember rightly.

RATING: 7
Will never play regular Monopoly again. Has just enough "take that" that'll make people yell at you but over fast enough that they don't hate you forever.

RATING: 8
I probably rated this one a little high because I expected it to be terrible. It really isn't. Well thought out card mechanics add a little strategy to the luck-heavy game, but the ability to target other player keeps the playing field pretty even.

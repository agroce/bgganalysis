Part of my paragraph game collection. It's weird, and modular and cool and I just wish I could get some folks to play it, although I hear the end game stinks.

RATING: 9
A fantastic paragraph-style RPG.  Immersive and full-o-theme.  Sadly, because the mystery is solved, re-playability is limited, hence my "9" rating.  With that said, the game is wonderfully imaginative.

I strongly believe a business opportunity exists for those with the creative chops:  Sell adventures separately from the board & bits.

First time I played this I loved it. Funky theme, very different, blend of RPG and boardgame. Played for about six hours and then suddenly, as a result of what seemed like another meaningless action, I won. Completely caught everyone off guard including me. This should have warned me that there were deep DEEP flaws in this game but it didn't. Second and third times and the turkeys came home too roost. All the really poor game mechanics became too big to ignore. The theme began to wear a little thin as a result and the third game ended without a winner after eight hours due to all the players agreeing they had had enough. I keep it purely as a collectable now, occasionally toying with coming up with alternative rules for it that would work. Maybe one day with those rules I will play it again, but never with the original rules... ever.

Really wanted to like this one.  Great theme and mechanism (paragraph book) but the pacing is ponderous and the game length is excessive, so players lose interest.

A very interesting and attractive game but, sadly, the height of its ambition is matched by the length of the playing time which, for me, is a flaw.

Cool and creative game - but it's just too much stuff pressed into it; it is oh! so long... Second game, 3 players, 5 hours, not the whole city disvovered, no end in sight. The same as in the first 2p game. And after 5 hours, the game begins getting dry.

A game one should have tried, but need not play a second time.

RATING: 6
This game is so cool, style-wise, and is bursting with ambience but it plays slooooow, sloooow, sloooow.  I don't want to do step-and-fetch in a video game; why do I want to do it on a board game? Plus your character can get beefy enough to take out anything in the game, but the city guards? No way, man. A+ for effort, but it would take a lot to get me to break it out again.

Interesting game idea and I really wanted to like it.  Tried to play it once but gave up before the end of the game. The game is too long (and I like Talisman!) and the rules were unclear in spots.  May try this game again, but it is near the bottom of the list.

this is a good paragraph game / light rpg. You explore a city drawing random tiles and then interact with its inhabitants to upgrade your character and solve a number of mysteries. The stories are great and so is exploring, the random event deck and the combat system are a little lame and the game has lots of mechanics that simply make it longer rather than adding to the fun. A good idea though and could do with a modern remake.

This is a weird, wonderful, imaginative storytelling game, full of strange and endearing ideas you won't find in your average fantasy game. The production value is very high, although the rules are messy, and some questions are never answered. Still, this is a game any fan of games like "Tales of the Arabian nights" or Fighting Fantasy books MUST own.

Copy with painted miniatures.
The most thematic game I have played so far. The story-lines are manyfold and range from funny to horrific. 
Replay-ability is not very high, but since the game takes about a day (!) to play through, I wouldn't want to play it more than once or twice a year anyway.

You can play this game by yourself, which is kinda cool.  In fact, I tried to play with two other people, but after 6 hours and getting nowhere fast, we had to just walk away.  This is a game you can walk around in for hours and never get close to winning.  Still, the whole choose your own adventure feel it has is also exciting and it's fun to create and develop a character.  Even if you don't get to play this, it might be worth buying just because I think you could steal about fifty ideas to flavor your D&D campaign instead of using the standard old man in the bar with a map.

The game may take at least a few hours and up to several days. The game has a very nice and unusual theme. Very creative. It has a great world.

That said: Some of the game mechanisms plain don't work, like movement with a D8 or combating several enemies. But experienced gamers can adjust and tighten these a little bit.

Still, you won't find a similar game to this one, in my opinion.

It was a grail of mine, and I almost bought one at the BGG flea market for $175.  An hour later, I checked it out of the library and started a three-player game.

Five hours later, I felt relieved.  $175 saved!

Honestly though, the gameplay wasn't so bad once the Stockholm Syndrome kicked in.  It's like 5 Choose Your Own Adventure books deconstructed through the cut-up method and pasted over a roll-and-move with no predefined end point.  It's dizzying, and if you like the sensation of vertigo I would recommend giving this a shot.

This was one of my grails, and I was ecstatic that I finally tracked it down. I've only played a short solo game to see how it worked, and I'm excited to try it with a group. I'm overly excited about this game, but am truly impressed with it so far, hench the high rating.

I did a two-part video review, available in the video section.

An odd-ball marriage of old Fighting Fantasy gamebooks gameplay with a boardgame.  Once you've seen the narrative, it loses a lot of replay value, and there are times when you feel like you're just wandering around.  You also need a ton of table space.  Overall, an interesting expirement, and likeable, but not that great a game.

A wonderfully imaginative game told in paragraph narration style.  I'm forced to give it an "8" because once you've played completely through the game, it loses much of it's replayability (which goes for any game of the same type).

Nostalgia rating. Replayability suffers once you know all the endings (that's what homebrew expansions are for).  

That said, this game was ahead of its time!  The minis are awesome and the writing for the quests and countless side encounters/conversations is spot on.  My favorite game of the '90's by far.

Very Hard to find - BUT WAIT!! "The new City of Chaos should be ready to play test early next year with a plan to release later in the year." (That's 2015) 

Players explore a randomly generated city seeking clues to uncover a source of the chaos that is afflicting the city and defeat it. Combines many different features: Tile Laying, Random Events, Reading, Mystery Solving.

Seems like Descent, but older, but may be more in depth...needs more research

RATING: 8
Now is a really great toolkit of a Paragraph game. Lots of strong parts all in one package. The Guild system is really interesting. The random event generation is full of surprises, and the overall theme of the game is top notch. The component and graphic design quality are also great. The game could use with some new adventures, or a more open system of gaming (ala Tales of the Arabian Nights). Having a conclusion to the adventure tends to lower replayability but this one certainly belongs next to TotAN as an essential paragraph game. If you can get a chance do yourself a favor and play City of Chaos.

Never made it through a full game - it's a paragraph game, and one that contains a fascinating universe, but it takes up too much space and plays too long for what it is. Also brutally unforgiving in spots, and can be unwinnable. Would love to see a PC game translation, even as interactive fiction.

This game has such a lot of atmosphere, playing it is like reading a good book or watching a film.  Rules need a little fine-tuning. Components are very good.

Cool, can't believe I found a copy second hand at a game shop in Utrecht!  I thought this game was a great lot of fun.  Have played 3 player a couple times (which seems to be about right) and did not finish, but loved the encounter descriptions, and the wild things that happened.  Should not play regularly, but every once in a while could create some really interesting adventures.  Amazing amount of work, and that it holds together is impressive.  The box is really full of stuff, too.

A really awesome setting and story with plenty of vivid scenes. I like the guilds and locations. I dimly remember that the combat system was rather annoying and that it seemed hard to win any fight. I guess that one should apply house-rules and instant rulings for certain bad situations.

Some nice ideas, some ideas that aren't quite as revolutionary as the designers thought (ie paragraph encounters a la Arabian nights).

RATING: 5.5
Completely crazy game I hate playing but will never part with. EDIT: I'm a goddamned liar. I sold it for crazy money on eBay and I don't miss it one bit.

The game is ostensibly an adventure game -- you control a little dude around an expanding, changing map, collect equipment and guild memberships, and try to figure out how to end the game. The game doesn't reveal its endgame other than through play -- and I have never actually finished a game of it!

There are a million problems with City of Chaos. You can fall so far behind that you simply cannot proceed. The map can get cleared out of interesting stuff. You can make bad early choices and, since you don't know how the game is supposed to proceed, you get screwed forever. There's no telling how long a game is supposed to last -- I've played up to 10 total hours in one game, and have attemped the stupid thing five or six times total, and have never gotten close to ending it. 

All that said, there's a really intriguing core to this game. All the interactions come out of a book that your opponents read to you, and it's highly variable what will happen each time (depends on kind of your ... social stance in each instance: friendly, threatening, and so on). Feels like a GMless (bad) RPG. I dunno! As much as I despise this game I'd probably once again attempt to play it with folks.

We played this once. It looked very promising, but than it started to drag. Some players characters died and had to start over again becoming easy victims for the others, who refused to take further risks themselves. Either we did something wrong, or the came is easily broken.

I have played this game once, and we completed it! We played with 5 players, started at 12 noon, and finished at 22:30. This included a long break for dinner.

Wow. Somehow I found a copy of this one this month (March, 2012), simply stumbled across it on Ebay and managed to get my bid in at the right time. I'm a big fan of the concepts in Arabian Nights, and it seems like this takes those concepts in a new direction. Really looking forward to getting this on the table and playing it. Most people seem to think this is quite the catch.

Apparently, this is also very rare. Not very many copies were printed, and the odds of a reprint are not good, so I've scratched my weird itch to own bizzare, rarely seen games with this one, too.

RATING: 9
I've had City of Chaos for around 10 years after my dad found it in a charity shop for Â£4. Best find ever. The game plays like a 'choose your own adventure book' and the storylines are both hilarious and engaging. It's a tough game to complete and requires a huge amount of time to play, but it's worth devoting an entire weekend to exploring all it has to offer.

RATING: 9
This is an outstanding game!  If you're looking for a game that tells a great story, look no further!  Just make sure you have a lot of space and a lot of time. Byronitar is huge by the end of the game!  While some say that the limited number of possible solutions limits replayability, I believe that is no more true of this game than Talisman or Prophecy, with their own limited number of end scenarios.  If you get a chance to play this, don't pass it up!  The only thing that kept this from getting a '10' is that its replayability is somewhat limited at the present time.  It was intended to be the first in a series of story telling games.  My current hope is that, after a reprint, that vision is pursued with subsequent releases.  Yes, I know I'm a dreamer.

Interesting, and I wouldn't mind playing more, but it could use streamlining. It's hard to get started, and the rules are very unclear about how to handle lots of things. 

E.g., I turned into a vampire and had to kill the other players. Except that when you die you restart. So by a strict reading of the rules we could have played pretty much forever, with everyone constantly restarting and then me killing them. (We decided that in this case death was permanent.)

This game just bleeds flavour. I can see that replayability can be a problem, moreso than with Arabian Nights maybe, as the game's encounters are very specific and there is an overall plot. Games can take quite a while to finish, usually sessions will end with people just giving up. This game could be brilliant if trimmed for length. At this stage its just a heartbreaker.

RATING: 4
Well this is an intriguing, unique game. The story is great but it feels very rough around the edges.
Finding out what you actually need will cost you quite a few body points then you are left by actually searching for that thing you need. Chances are that after that you will need a second item... So it really has something going for it, but it really should be more challenging rather than punishing. 

The game is really unique, but re-playability kills it for me.

Recommended variants :
- Start with 2 groats extra
- a guild membership of choice
- 3 points, which you should allocate to A and/or D
- 2 groat for every street exploration
- 1 groats for a location.
- 5 groats for a special location.
- a default movement of 2 + d8
- possibility of buying a steam-powered-boots in the shops for a movement of 20 (unable to use for exploration).
- Once a special item is given, closing off the 
  encounter that made that possible. (for flavour)

RATING: 7
I have very mixed feelings about this game.  I was tempted to sell it after one play, but want to explore some aspects of the story some more.

Pros:
Very rich in theme
Fun to explore the city and see all the tiles spread out
Interactions with characters bring different responses 
Interesting to see how the story unfolds with the clues
Appears to be multiple ways to win
Even after two long games, still much that I do not know
Game is very ambitious and unique
Although there are many random events, the story actually progresses
While there are random aspects to how events play out, your decisions do have an impact
There is actually a game here (vs Arabian Nights)

Cons
Very long - takes many hours to play
The story is fair - not as dark as hoped, hokey at times
Use variants for movement or even slower
Challenges do not adjust based on experience so easy to die when starting
Action deck is thick - if you choose wrong option, long time before get another shot, especially since somebody else may draw it next time
Doubts about whether will stand up to repeated plays once you know story and clues
Portions of the board can become inaccessible
Money is too tight and slows down game/character progression
Need to allow time between game plays for best effect
Game can hit a wall after a few hours when all the locations are on the board, but few clues have been found.  Then you just randomly try to churn up clues.


=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Great enthralling game, surreal miniatures and a great fantasy feel. The comments on game length are fair, but if playing with the right group, you get engrossed and it doesn't seem to matter.
Have heard rumour that some expansions were being made, and would love to know if these ever were - if anyone knows...

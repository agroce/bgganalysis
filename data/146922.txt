A fun game that emphasises the man and his motivation over the rate of fire of his weapon.

I've had the fortune of playing more than 5 games and have watched a few more.  The game is a blast.  There are a lot of rules and a Quick Reference Sheet is a must.

Innovative and challenging ruleset.

Very clever rules for Platoon level tabletop games. Different armies play differently according to their doctrine.

RATING: 9
Initial play was quite good and yielded a close game with plenty of game friction. The initial phase of the game, the Patrol Phase, turned out to be innovative and enjoyable. Looking forward to many more plays of this great skirmish game.

Second game was even better, getting more rules correct in this play.

Third game confirms the rating.  Such a tense, friction-filled experience.

Excellent focus on the platoon+ size action, scalable up to company size with addtional players (see Big Chain of Command free supplement). Rewards historical tactics and TO&E rather than powergaming.

I like the rule set in general. Seems to model WWII platoon fire and move tactics well.

Found this game boring and over complicated.  The patrol phase at the beginning of the game is its only highlight.

Best platoon level tactical ww2 miniatures game out there

RATING: 9
Very good game, and also good simulation. You need to understand the tactical doctrines of the troops you are using. Americans work differently to British or Russians or Germans or Italians.

My favorite set of WW2 rules

RATING: 6
I have now played this a number of times. It has two clever features - the patrol phase and the dice rolls for activations. Strip these away, and I found some things quite unbalancing for their points costs. Also, the activation mechanic can sometimes overtake the game where someone wins purely on getting multiple activations based on good dice rolling.

Some fantastic mechanisms (including the pre-game) make this a great platoon sized set of WW2 rules with some challenging decisions which allows you to use historical tactics

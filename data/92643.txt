RATING: 6
Definitely play with the advanced rules, that allows for some planning.  I can't see playing this with more than 2 players, but for 2 players, its a decent tactical game with some decision making (limited by cards of course).  Could be prone to some analysis paralysis due to the consequences of moving the king.  Kind of different, but not quite up to par for a new "Kramer & Kiesling".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Kramer's soothingly ordered and intensely interactive design approach is on display yet again in Artus.

The game boldly snubs the Eurogamer's dependency on strategic straight-jackets and creates something almost purely tactical in which every turn is a new puzzle to be solved.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very simple yet thinky movement/scoring game.  I think the pawn color choices are suspect, but otherwise a fine game.  Only other complaint is that planning ahead is almost discouraged, making for some long turns.

Base game is a 6, the advanced version is a 7.

Artus reminds me somewhat of Draco & Co., the old Faidutti/Schacht game, which had the same round table and similarly rewarded staying close to the King.  Of course, with Kramer and Keisling at the helm, the chaos and fun of Draco is banished; Artus is a chin-stroking, tactical thinker of a game.  And it's an OK game.  It is important to keep a balanced hand of cards that move your pieces, move or promote royal pieces and score victory points.  Saving the vp cards until the end while forfeiting your ability to influence the board is a surefire way of losing.

Production quality and artwork are as you would expect from Alea.  The revolving table with a roast boar in the middle was a nice idea, but it is not as securely moored as I would have liked.

A grew an ammiration for Kramer & Kiesling after finally trying El Grande and falling in love with it, so I took a risk and bought Artus.
The game is a fast playing abstract with a wheel at its core: players move their (or neutral) pieces using cards, and score points based on the starting position of the piece being moved OR score some special cards (in the advanced game; i don't see the point in playing the basic version).
The game is definitely tactical: strategies are absolutely out of reach even with two players, and with more the chaos would be definitely unmanageable.
A pleasant tactical filler for two, for lovers of abstracts.

After the first play I am convinced that this is another great Alea (usual bizarre choice of colours - Fuchsia again) medium box game. The scoring is a nice mix of grabbing instant points whilst you can and setting up the big scoring cards, whilst the system of having to play all 18 of your cards once each and the interference from other players makes for some difficult decisions.

Part way through my first game, I must admit I was disappointed when my opponents (who had played before) both raced away with early knight scoring and I was struggling to set up my scoring cards. I began to think that the game was unbalanced, though I was proved wrong when they were left in a poor position at the end with a handful of scoring cards, which dragged many tens of points off them.

RATING: 6.5
It was okay.  Tactical.  I think there could be strategy that lies in how you group your knights and working on setting up scoring possiblities with your scoring cards.  Could go up to a six if I play again.  Wasn't bad by any means, I just find it average.  

Aug 2015 - Played it again and pushed it up a full point to 6.5.  I found it with three to be better than two and I think that is because of the chaos it causes.  I'm not sure about four but with three it added just the right dollop of chaos.  Since it was my second time playing I know the gist so it made it a better game.  More plays and I can see this going up to a seven.

Zseniális játék. Nem találkoztam még ilyen mechanikával. Előre nem sokat lehet gondolkodni, de annál inkább érdekes, amikor ránk kerül a sor. Mindig a helyzetnek megfelelő legjobb döntést kell meghozni a kezünkben lévő kártyáinkból . Alap verziót nem javaslom, érdemes azonnal a haladóval kezdeni, mert az adja meg a sava-borsát a játéknak.

RATING: 6
Although there is certainly a lot of chaos in this one, I do think that strategy does play at least a small role.   In the end it comes down to taking calculated risks, and making the best of scoring cards, even if it means locking in small losses.

Probably wouldn't play this often, and certainly wouldn't buy it, but it's a reasonably entertaining game.   

Initial rating a 6.

Played with the advanced rules. Too much random to allow you to plan your moves, too many cards (22 per player) to keep the track of the previous moves: you wait for your turn and try to get as much as you can. Basically an abstract game with good artwork, it did not "click" with my group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A challenging game that is enjoyable as long as you don't take it too seriously--it can become very frustrating otherwise. I am hilariously bad at these kinds of spacial optimization games (e.g. Druidenwalzer), but I actually think this one is fun. The central wheel is especially tricky to figure out because the poles are not symmetrically oriented, making it difficult to predict how the scoring will change.

After reading the rules, seems like a development of Viva Pamplona and Verflixxt. It's probably more of a gamer's game than either of those, but still looks to be lighter than most Alea games.

RATING: 6
Do yourself a favor and just skip to the advanced rules unless you're playing with kids, as there is very little meaningful decision-making in the basic game.  The advanced rules really allow for a lot more difficult decisions as well as opportunities to make good plays.

Some people will not like the tactical nature of this game.  It's very much a game where you only need to pay attention when it's your turn, as the board state can change fairly drastically between turns, not allowing for much in the way of planning ahead.

However, I enjoyed it well enough.  Everyone gets the same hand of cards, and you're forced to play ALL of them throughout the game, even if you may not want to.  So, not only is the game about scoring big points on plays; it's also about minimizing the damage certain other cards in your hand might inflict.

RATING: 6
This game is ... weird. The authors have of course long since departed from the heavy fare which cemented their reputation amongst gaming enthusiasts, so don't expect Artus to be a continuation of the old Mask trilogy or anything. Instead, Artus is based on the story of Arthur and the Round Table; the game here is simply playing a game of musical chairs.

The weird thing about Artus is that a cursory glance suggests that chaos rules. But after playing it a few times, I have this nagging suspicion that there is actually more control possible than meets the eye. Knights do not move about all that readily, and the table with its central point disc has a fixed distribution of bonuses and maluses. That means that heuristic calculations dealing with a knight's projected VP value should be possible, and that thus the game becomes more controllable. It is that nagging feeling that withholds me from awarding Artus a lower rate than it otherwise might have gotten. (And perhaps still will, but at least that opinion will be based on more than a few plays.) Continued experiments are planned.

[b]Update[/b] The key is pattern matching. Memorise the relative position of your knights when they are in a good VP-gathering location, then try to play cards to such an extent that you always end up with that pattern. As a corollary, disrupt the pattern of that of your opponents. And voilà, order in chaos.

RATING: 7
Found it totally random and meaningless during my first game, but after playing with two before trying it multiplayer again I've come around. It's extremely tactical, of course, but that's something I'm liking more and more (Theseus, Tash-Kalar, and I probably should give Innovation another chance). I like the planning, the spatial thinking and having to choose the scoring between something ok/not that bad now compared to something excellent or possibly catastrophical later.

RATING: 6
A game of tight margins where you try to do the same as everyone else while scoring slighty more points. Better with more players, should always be played with the 'optional' advanced scoring cards, adding a damage-mitigation element to scoring and further emphasizing the need to properly manage and time your card-play.

Components: Drab components. The one standout element is the feast-decorated round table, but I find all its meat imagery distasteful. The gold and silver are a bit difficult to distinguish on the cards. The special scoring cards are cluttered up with three languages (especially the card that permits three different uses).

Experience: Total chaos. Like in Dos Rios, there is zero opportunity to plan ahead, because so much can change in between turns. This is purely tactical, with a bit of gambling (do I score the reds now for -15, or wait, hoping for something better down the road?). It's important to keep a good variety of cards in hand, but it's much more important to be favored by the luck of the draw and the luck of how the person to my right leaves the board for me.

On my turn, I am rewarded for taking a long time to consider all my options. If all players play this way, the game slows way down.

There's something very pleasing about moving around a circular board, especially when you can go both forwards and backwards.  It's about the journey, not the destination, right?

Except the destination is what gives you points.  And the destination is largely random, given the actions of the other players between your turns and the severe constraints of your hand of cards.  There's almost no way you can make any kind of long-term plans and keep them, so you go for the short-term VPs and hope for the best.

With four players, this is so chaotic that I wouldn't bother.  Might be better with two?

King Arthur with rotating round table and rings
Each player has six cards in hand – two knight cards, two royalty cards, and two scoring cards – and plays two cards each turn. By doing this, players are able to place figures of their color or neutral figures around the table, score certain areas or figures under certain circumstances, and place rings on neutral figures or to move them. The neutral figure bearing three rings is the current king, and the table is always oriented to place this figure in the crown location. A new king can come into power though, which will find everyone sitting in a new location.

This game is really fairly abstract, but I prefer abstracts with a light theme like this one. It's interesting to play, easy to teach, and presents you with tough decisions to make. The spinning table is clever, yet the table position mechanic is reminiscent of other games. Overall it's fairly light, with a bit of randomness. It plays fairly quickly though, and you can teach it to new players very quickly as well. I would recommend with 2 and 3 as a filler or gateway game.  4 may be too chaotic but I haven't tried yet.

húúú, tetszik. Nagyon. Bár az elején kicsit nem tudtam figyelni, emiatt aztán nem sok esélyem volt, de aztán tetszett. 4-en sem hosszú: 45-50 perc. Gyors, pörgős: nem érdemes előre tervezni túl sokat -vmennyit nyilván igen, de alapvetően az adott szituációra kell reagálni, mégha a hosszabb távú terveiddel is.
Kellő játék után valószínű kiismernénk annyira, h jobban gonoszkodóssá lehetne tenni, és nem csak magadra a másikra is jobban figyelni, kinek milyen kártyája van még stb.
Szóval én beleszerettem. :-)
Pedig csak max 4 személyes...
Update:
2. játék 3 személyes volt.
Hosszabbra is sikeredett - a társak lassabban gondolkodtak.
Ugyanakkor már ügyesebben terveztünk: ezt jól mutatja, h sikerült 150 pont fölé menni 2-nk neki is.
Azért ahhoz, h komolyan akadályozzuk is az ellent, ne csak véletlenszerűen, a magunk építése miatt, ahhoz még kellene jó pár játék.

2011

There are two levels of play: The beginner's game and the advanced game.  I would only play the beginner's game with a child younger than 9, the minimum age suggested.

The advanced game has some clever strategy for timing the play of scoring cards, which can hit a player with huge negative or positive points.  

It is difficult to plan ahead because the board rotates and pieces exchange places.  So there can be some down time when a player's turn begins.  

Each player gets the same set of cards, and each card is played only once during the game, and then the game is over.  The luck of drawing does add chaos to the game, but even this can be manipulated to a certain extent.   Knowing the cards helps considerably.

The board could have been very dull, but the theme they chose (it could have been any number of themes)was artfully and colorfully executed, and the moving board is fun.  

I like the advanced game and will enjoy playing it on occasion.

At first glance this game is very unassuming but playing it is pretty fun. It's pretty much an abstract game so theme and art don't really matter that much although I do love any game with an Arthurian theme.

The game is all about scoring the right cards at the right time. The fun part is that you will also score a lot of negative points, there is nearly no way around it. I don't think I've ever seen a game where you try to score the fewest negative points.

Ein Spiel wie es mir gefällt,
einfache Regel, viel Taktik, ein wenig ärgern und blöffen.
Auch wenn die Mitspieler einem die aktuelle Planung durch die eigenen Spielzüge eventuell kaputt machen, so hat man doch immer genügend eigenen Handlungsspielraum, für welche Karten man sich beim Nachziehen entscheidet.
Auch, dass man selbst zwei Karten hintereinander ausspielt, und jede einzelne wertet, fördert die Taktik um einiges.

Michael Schacht should get design credits for Artus. This is basically a rehashing of his card game Die Tafelrunde (or the later reimplementation Draco & Co) with a board. Granted, some of the changes feel like huge improvements and help make the game much less chaotic, like all players having an identical deck to work with, but a lot less chaotic really doesn't mean much in this context.

Artus is still an utterly chaotic affair. I guess there is something there for those who like entirely tactical optimization but that's about all there is.

RATING: 6
Very tactical game.  There is very little long term strategy in respect to the position of your knights at the round table, but it isn't a game of entirely responding to the cards in your hand.  

Knowledge of the cards is important, as it can definitely lead to some strategy in moving knights, setting up their placement and, knowing how to mange your hand successfully.

The basic game is a throw away, only play the advanced title.  

A bit like That's Life with the scoring cards from Torres.  I really like this one, but fear most people will wrongfully discard it as being too random.

A strong light/mid weight game with a short playing time that isn't just another worker placement, deck building or, dice management game.  Kudos to Alea for bucking the current trend and trying something fresh.

Enjoyable tactical game of positioning knights around king Arthur's table in relation to the king; with the scoring cards becomes quite a thinky game.

Massively chaotic!

Bad?  Not for everyone.

I've played both rule sets.

The basic is ultimately 100% tactical.  It seemed frustrating to the other players at the table.  I did start to see some strategy on how to 'spread' your pieces.  But, ultimately it was agreed to go to the advanced.

With the two actions a turn instead of one makes it a bit more controlable.  Still very tactical.  The scoring cards though make the game.  Deciding when to score and not letting the cards force you too score is very fun.

(03/22/2014) Comment based on one play.

I didn't realize this was a Kiesling & Kramer design, but it does have the duo's fingerprints all over it. It is an interesting positional optimization game involving the seating arrangement of the Knights of the Round Table. Players are trying to sit as close to the right of King Arthur in order to score points. Players can play three kinds of cards: 1) king cards to do with movement and crowning (with "rings") of the king and/or three princes that surround the table; 2) knight cards that allow the player to move their own knights around the table; and 3) scoring cards that allow the player to score, which is dependent on the current game state of the board. The last aspect is most interesting, where scoring is dependent on where the knights are in relation to the current king, and also what section of the table they occupy.

The nine seats immediately to the right of the king score successively lower positive scores, ranging from 10 VP down to 2 VP, which is the "green" section of the table. Then there is a "red" section, where the seating is progressively more negative scores, ranging from -1 VP all the way to -15 VP. Then, there is a three-seat "yellow" section, where all three seats score 0 VP. The scoring cards are reminiscent of the Master Cards in Kiesling & Kramer's [thing=88][/thing], where the players must have a specific arrangement of their knights in one or all three of the colored sections. For example, there is one that is a negative scoring card that forces scoring of three knights that happen to be sitting in the "red" section. There is one that scores all the knights, wherever they happen to be. There is also one that requires a knight, in each of the three colored sections. The most intriguing one allows scoring of all the knights, but with [i]opposite[/i] scoring, where a "-15" becomes "+15", and so forth.

Scoring can also occur whenever a knight is moved to a new seat (the player scoring the points from where the knight moved from), or whenever a prince is crowned or moved.

Cards are played two at a time from a hand of six, with the player refreshing two cards from their choice of the three decks of royalty, movement, or scoring. This is similar to the drawing of action cards in Torres, where the draws are blind, but at least the player is allowed to look at the first draw, before deciding which deck to draw from, for the second card. Play continues until all 22 cards (for each player) are played.

This is an interesting VP maximization game, with a novel mechanical twist, where the table (and hence the scoring positions) rotates with reference to the current king, while all the seats remain fixed. Players must predict or anticipate where the table will move (based on their own card play, or their opponents'), and where the scoring positions will be in the near-future, much like the gear mechanism in [thing=126163][/thing], and take advantage of scoring opportunities when they present themselves. In a 2-player game, this is relatively easy to do, while I suspect that it will be chaotic with 3 or 4 players. Players must be careful to balance the play of the three card types, since there are severe penalties associated with being forced playing a scoring card in which the player was unable to satisfy the printed conditions. For example, if a player did not have a knight, in each of the three colored sections, but was forced to play the card (because they had no other options), the penalty could be as high as -50 VP!

As a 2-player game, it was rather dry, but could be more exciting (and more frustrating) with more players. It is a genius of game design, a "pure" Euro, through and through, as only from the minds of Kiesling & Kramer. But, is it a great game? No. However, it is a very good filler-ish game that plays in 60 minutes. With interesting and meaningful decisions every turn, plenty of interaction, and infinite re-playability, this is a good, solid game. Initial rating is a "7", with limited room to go up with subsequent plays.

A sort of medieval musical chairs, where knights move around the table, but if the king moves, the table moves with him!

Played twice so far, once with basic set of rules and once with the advanced set.

In my eyes the game works better with the basic rules as it offers a really nice screw your opponent mechanism. It is true, you cannot plan far ahead (regardless of the set of rules!) and thus the basic rules make for the faster and more fun game. The additional scoring cards in the advanced rules can easily add analysis paralysis to the game.

Play Artus as a fun screwing game with the basic rules!

ZERO control.

HUGE differences between the final scores of players.

The novice can crush the experienced player.

This game, in fact, DEFINES a boardgame with one, specific, predominant characteristics.  I mean, since now a word 'Artus' takes a meaning: 'a game with 0 control'.  

Just BURN the game if you happen to see it.

This is a beautiful game and I like the mechanics behind how the round table moves and how seats change which each move.  However, I would never play this again as a 4 player game.  It's really just too chaotic.  If you set up a move, good luck being able to do what you wanted to by the time it gets back to your turn.  As a two player game, this is probably going to be at its best.  Otherwise, do avoid.

Advanced game only - the basic game doesn't seem to be worth playing. Artus is highly tactical in figuring out how to best play your given cards each turn. Advance planning is very limited and probably only feasible to some degree with two players. It's also much more thinky in the advanced version than I was expecting and shouldn't be played with more than three. As I'm fond of rules-light games with a tactical focus, Artus was a positive surprise given its mediocre reception on BGG. My biggest gripe with it is its garish design, not with its gameplay.

It's kind of funny how the theme is pasted on, I would have liked to be a fly on the wall observing different potential themes.

The game is pretty random, as most people say it is.  It's hard to do much planning ahead.  So far I've only played with three - I would not suggest playing with 4.  2 may be the sweet spot.  Still, even though it's random, it's kind of fun.  It doesn't take too long and is kind of relaxing.

Kramer & Kiesling has lost their touch. The game idea here sounds better than the game actually is. It's dry and there is hard to make any longtime plans: before your next turn situations has changed a lot - so actually this is more like "maximise scores and forget the future" -game. So far I've only played the basic game, so we'll see, what the advanced version brings on. The friend of mine said, that there might be the same problem with Artus than Torres has: basic game is too random, advanced game is totally dry. Don't know that yet.

I'm really impressed by Alea's brave move to publish something so different from the recent trend of Euros even if it will surely mean many of their fans will not like the change. It's a great but mostly tactical game and seemingly this sounds as swear words for many.

Artus is bad with those who overanalyse, over-optimise their moves. It's mostly a tactical game, not a game of strategy, even if you have to take care of those special cards (expert version) to use them wisely during the game. When played in the right tempo it's a fine tactical game with quite much tension throughout. It's also a mean game, but in a good way. And although it uses a kind of rondel, its approach felt rather novel.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
If you choose to play, jump immediately to the advanced rules.  I cannot imagine playing with the basic rule set.

LIKES:

* Everyone has the same set of 22 cards of which each person has a random selection of 6 each turn of which they must play two.  In the advanced rules, this allows for you to set up some nice combos!
* I do like the idea of the wheel and the scoring that results based on where the king is located.
* In the advanced game with the scoring cards, you are forced to score pain - you just try to minimize the pain.  If you fail to do so, you may get penalized severely.  Be sure to inform everyone of each score card's penalty as one causes you to lose 50 points if you fail to complete the requirements!!!!  That can easily be 1/3 of your score in a 4 player game.

DISLIKE:

* The red carpet interrupts the scoring track and can confuse people when they are counting their spaces to keep score.  Poor choice in not having a continuous score track.
* Planning ahead is almost pointless in this game which means if you are playing with AP prone individuals, you are going to be bored when it isn't your turn as they churn through their options.

Very weird game.  The moving parts of the board are the principle gimmick, but it does a good job of organizing the spacial aspects of this puzzle.  The hardest choices are probably which decks to try to dig cards out of; controlling how and when you score is obviously important, but moving around and crowning new kings are the core of the game, and inability to do either of these things in punishing.

one of the weakest Alea title, among the same rank as Saint Malo. Little control, radical change in position in between your turns and you have nothing to do during other's turns, makes this game more like a random gamble (though in theory, not esp with fewer no of players) rather than a thoughtful game. I prefer almost any other filler other than this one. (OK, Saint Malo excluded also)

Original game that requires spacial insight and a large amount of good luck.

Just as with the great majority of abstracts, Artus is a fine headscratcher with two, and it has a bonus option for a lighter tactical fun with more. The meat of the game is balancing and timing the hands of six from the identical decks of 18, playing two cards in a turn. This makes the game just the perfect length and depth for us. It has a nice flow, much welcomed variety and a room for a bit of nastiness to help the game keeping above the average.

My main motivation for buying this game was to keep my Alea small, medium, and large box sets complete.  The good news is that this game is actually not bad even though I'm not a big fan of tactical games.  There is some planning in positioning your knights for potentially big scores in future turns but usually you need a bit of luck from your right hand neighbor to leave the board in a favorable position.  I agree that you must play the advanced rules right from the start.

I played a 4 player game and it was very chaotic.

The spinning board is awesome.

Beaucoup trop chaotique à mon goût. Impossible de bâtir une stratégie (sinon peut-être d'articuler quelque chose autour d'une certaine proximité entre nos chevaliers) car la situation change trop entre deux tours (nos propres pièces pouvant entre autre être déplacées durant les tours adverses). Temps morts assez importants car chaque décision demande réflexion et calculs. On essaie trop souvent d'éviter le pire et parfois ces décisions vont permettre au prochain joueur de marquer beaucoup de points. Le timing, le hasard des cartes piochées, un élément de chance assez présent et une durée de jeu un peu trop longue pour ce que c'est font que je suis content de l'avoir essayé mais que je n'ai pas vraiment envie d'y rejouer (quoique, peut-être à deux joueurs). 

Ça m'a donné un peu l'impression de Fealty dans la planification des cartes à jouer et le placement et déplacement d'éléments dans des zones précises du jeu; mais la comparaison est un peu boiteuse je l'admets.

Every player gets 22 cards, 6 of which are scoring cards based on the current layout of the board, and each player must eventually play each card. Considering that the scoring cards are more likely to grant negative points than positive, this is a game in which the scoreboard at the current moment doesn't tell the whole tale, much like Too Many Cooks. It's probably a more pure strategic experience to play head-to-head (think Scrabble, Go, etc. -- any game with move/countermove dynamic), but unlike Scrabble, for me there was an enjoyable level of chaos in the 3p version.

excellent ideas. tactical game. unfortunately the board changes enough in a 4p game, that it is almost impossible to see what moves would be possible on your next turn. still liked it, but it brings down the rating. typical Kramer fare. recommended to play only as a 2 or 3 player game with fast players. 4 player rating is 3, it is much too chaotic then.

First impression (3 players): All the mechanics are pretty nice but the game that they form is very chaotic. You can do no forward planning as the situation can totally turn around before it's your turn. I really liked the idea of scoring cards that you must use but that easily won't give you any positive points. 

Probably best with 3 players as the fourth one will only bring more downtime.

I'm really quite taken with Artus. The game's detractors point to the lack of strategy, but they're missing the point. Artus is a game of risk management and deck management; one where you get out for as few losses as possible. Sure, it's chaotic with any more than two players (and in fact, fairly hectic even head-to-head), but if you treat each hand as an analysis of the current game state, rather than trying to strategise the future, then quite a nice set of ideas emerges. Then there's just about enough strategy in drawing cards from the right stacks and knowing the deck well.

There is no way to plan ahead prior to your turn: the board resets quite radically as each player takes their actions. The problem is compounded because visualising the effects of your actions can be quite tricky for some players. Artus is likely to promote slow play.

I found it quite frustrating: at one point we discussed playing another game simultaneously, so that there would be something to do between turns.

To be fair, it is improved with the bonus score cards (and less chaotic with two players), but it's still aggravating.

The other thing to note is that Artus is completely abstract - the theme is barely painted-on, let alone pasted-on.

I'll play it again, but not often...

This game is really beautifully designed. It has a great theme where the knights of King Arthur sit around the round table. You could imagine them in deep discussions seated around the round table eating a large feast.

Anyway, the game is very simple. You have a certain number of cards you may draw each turn and you may choose from any of your 3 piles of cards (Knight cards, King cards and Objective/victory cards). Based on where your knights are around the round table you can collect victory points. Each player has the same cards in all three piles, but they are all randomly shuffled and each player will randomly select from the piles each turn. A player may be working to get all their knights to earn points if they are on good positive numbered seats around the table. Or a player might be looking for all their knights to be scored on the red carpet seats. 

The clever thing is the king is always sitting at a zero seat. If he moves so does the round table...it turns to reposition itself on the king. And if a new king becomes crowned the table will turn to the new king. And finally every player will play all of their cards. So if you get stuck with an impossible objective and can't seem to get a positive score for yourself, you still have to play the card.

Pure Euro; a tactical game with a slight Arthurian theme slapped on the pieces. With mechanical similarities to Dog or Sorry!, Artus could fit in the category of Classic Family-style Euros with both good and bad connotations. There is a fast and easy rule set, simple mechanics and meaningful decisions to be made every turn. However, Artus lacks any sort of player interaction (or at the very least, luck or randomness) thrown into the gameplay to make things exciting. There's no fault in the game design, but I wouldn't call it a game to be enjoyed by everyone.

Only played the advance game which includes the scoring cards. It's a game of getting your pawns into best-available-scoring positions and scoring the best you can each round. You can keep in mind what you might want to do on future rounds, but the board state can change radically between turns - the score-table rotates each time the king moves or changes - so the game felt massively tactical, doing the best you can each turn with what's presented. Big change also results in big downtime, and that's the big flaw here - there's little chance to prepare your turn beforehand. With 5 pawns out and 6 cards in hand, and clever things to do re rotating the score-table, and you play a two card combo each turn, it takes time to process options, whilst the pressure is on to rush things to keep the game moving. But the game really doesn't want to allow it, which makes for a touch of frustration at opportunities missed. In the end, too abstract and too slow.

This is a very chaotic game that plays like a spacial reasoning puzzle. It didn't work well with 2 players, and I can only seeing it get more chaotic with more. In this game you get three piles of cards. Over the course of the game you draw the cards and have to eventually play all cards. You get pawns around a rotating wheel that generate you either positive or negative points depending on where they finish their move, or in the case of neutral pawns, start their move. I would have liked it better if you had your pick of all the cards at the start and had to budget.

the round table is a neat mechanic. it can be hard to plan ahead without following your opponent's played cards very closely. usually just a good idea to get rid of your high-penalty cards fast. definitely fun with 3 players. must try more.

RATING: 8
Clever game of card-play and movement. Players sequentially move knights, princes, and the King around King Arthur's table via the play of movement cards, scoring points based on a roulette-like board. Remembering which cards your opponents are holding and strategically playing special cards (and scoring cards, in the Advanced Game) are key to throwing off opponent strategies.

This is a very unique card game.  Probably only a two player game though as the chaos would make this a game that should not be taken seriously.  As a two player, this is a light strategic game that is very intriguing as it has a damage control component but also has some press your luck when determining when the best time to play scoring card.  Knowing these scoring cards and anticipation of these cards is the key to a successful point total.  Multiple plays is need to learn how and when to use them is needed.  I really enjoyed this despite a little down time between turns but that is why I would reiterate that this is easily best as a two player strategy card game.

I played this for the first, and so far only, time, back in March 2014 - and I do not expect to ever play this again. Not that this is a terrible game, but it's such a tactical mess that it's very hard to plan anything - most of the time you're maximising your immediate VPs this turn, while trying to avoid leaving yourself with no good options next turn. But your opponent can quite easily change everything on their next turn, making planning ahead virtually impossible. I may be doing the game an injustice in concluding this after just one play, but at the same time it felt too chaotic - while also being a bit of a brain-burner - to want to come back to any time soon. I suspect that to play well you have to count both your and your opponent's cards, adding another element that I'm not too keen on.

Note that this is all in the context of a 2-player game - I can't even imagine playing this with 3 or 4, the chaos will be multiplied many times and probably turn the whole thing into simply maximising your immediate VPs while hoping you don't get hosed as a random effect of other players' actions. With 2 I can potentially see it becoming an interesting little tactical battle, but as I said I'm not interested enough in the game to make the effort to reach this stage.

In fairness, I'm talking only about the "beginner" game - the extra scoring cards do look a little interesting, but I don't see how they'd change the basic problem of too much chaos.

Still, not a terrible game, just not one I think I'd ever choose to play again.

Before I bought this game I read all the comments about the game being too random and too chaotic, but I thought I could handle it. On paper the game really sounded interesting and right up our alley.  After playing I had to agree with all these other comments: too chaotic and random for sure. And our scores (in a 2 player game) were miles apart, 15 to 55.  Wasted by money on this one for sure.

Really!? A boring tactical splash of little plastic pawns and numbered cards. It's as themeless as it is senseless. This one has so many turns of rinse cycle and repeat that it's been wrung dry. Moreover we seem to be taking a step backwards in gaming evolution - back to the days of King Arthur where tic-tac-toe would have been cutting edge, but not today. The King Arthur theme is dull and this game replicates that wonderfully. Oh, it has a wheel that turns, which is easier than moving all the pawns around to the new king I guess. Really!?

RATING: 6
The most tactical game ever in the history of time. There's no sense planning your turn before your turn, so it kinda drags. I think fewer is better here--I wonder how the 2-player is...

I can see no reason to play anything other than the Advanced Game. 

There are some neat things going on. There are scoring cards you will eventually have to play, so maneuvering things so they don't hurt you too badly--and maybe even score a few positive points--is interesting. 

But the extreme tactical-ness, and my disinterest when others are taking their turns kills it for me.

RATING: 5
Artus --

Disappointed — and my hopes weren't high to begin with.  It feels as though you should try to maximize your opportunities on your turn, so it's easy to take too long weighing options.  But there is very little real control, and the many variables on the board can (and do) change so widely and unpredictably, that planning ahead is simply not feasible.  In most games, I enjoy watching other players' turns, but in Artus I found that the only turn that had any bearing on my own was the turn immediately before my own.  You might as well leave the room between turns, since you can only begin to work out your own options at the beginning of your turn.

Best part of this game is the rotating "round table". The game is ok, but really chaotic. You can only play one round at the time and minimize your losses (or sometimes maximize your points). Only advance thinking is what cards to draw at the end of your turn.

W: Yes, Michael.
M: Well, I was thinking that we should just make a game out of that. Is the design cool enough?
W: Yes, Michael.
M: Shall we begin?
W: Yes, Michael.

It is a neat little tactical abstract game that plays quick enough to justify its existence.  It certainly is the most playable Alea game for me in a long while.  Where it suffers is that there isn't any storytelling, and while I get the whole round table thing, there isn't anything else here that has any comparison to King Arthur.

The art is really bad.  The cover looks like one of those commission pieces where you can get your wife's face painted onto some fantasy chick in chainmail.  While the board is fully functional (along with the cards), it is a bit spare and the cut and paste elements make it look like a rushed project.  Both artists have done far better work in the past.

It worked well with two and three, I have no interest in the four player version as it will clearly be too chaotic for my taste.

We played the "family" or "casual" rules, and I found it a little too chaotic and luck-based for my taste.  The table can change so much with 3 other players taking turns before your next move, it is only luck that allows you to set up a good play.  In addition the cards are drawn at random, so you often won't get cards you need on a turn.  I had to keep taking negative points, because all my knights kept getting herded over to the negative side of the table until I had half the score of the other players, and they stopped picking on my knights.

RATING: 7
Card-driven game of moving knights around a table & re-orienting the table so scoring values jump around. The rotating table is cool, but isn’t good for AP-prone players. The more players there are, the harder it is to predict how things will stand for your next turn, so apart from a bit of zonal positioning, there are few opportunities to plan ahead.

Only tried the advanced game: using all your cards during the game means that you sometimes need to take a small hit to prevent the possibility of a big hit later. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game is highly chaotic.  The board constantly changes to the point where you almost can't think about your turn until it's literally your turn.  It's also sort of a puzzle game in which you try to arrange your pieces so that you meet scoring conditions.  If you can see what your opponents are doing, you'll have a good shot at scoring a lot of points.

I liked it as a 2-player but I have a hard time thinking it will be good with any more due to the chaos factor.

This one lost it's charm.  Traded away May 2012.

RATING: 7
Unassuming yet pleasingly tactical abstract game. The aim is to move knights around King Arthur's table in an attempt to score points. The table also moves thereby altering the position of the different points, many of which are negative. The advanced version, which introduces scoring cards that have some really tricky methods for acquiring points, requires a great deal of thought and ensures that players manage their hands well. It's not particularly thematic but it's certainly a clever little game.

Nagyon absztrakt és taktikai játék. A parti második felében jobban odafigyeltem a lehetőségekre és szorosan egymás mellett végeztünk a többi újonccal. A játéktulajdonos persze egy egész kört (50 pont) vert ránk.

Eléggé Kramer-Kiesling feeling-je van a játéknak, de sokkal egyszerűbb a szabály és sokkal gyengébb a játék kidolgozása. A grafia egyenesen szörnyű és a gurulós műanyag figurák is rettentőek.

Az ötlet még talán nem lenne olyan rossz, de a megvalósítás kimondottan ront az amúgy is száraz és absztrakt játékon, ahelyett hogy kedvet csinálna hozzá.

A very tight agonizing game. Players have equal decks to move their knights; move and crown princes and kings; and to score. All cards must be used, so the question is how well they can be used. The biggest problem with the game is that down time is total: if you tend to plan ahead, you have to force yourself not to, being completely futile.

I'll be the first to admit that Artus is both clever and challenging. However, it's also very abstract and dry - the same reaction I had to Carolus Magnus, another game in which you go round in endless circles. If you like puzzles, you may enjoy this. If you prefer games where mechanics mesh seamlessly with rich theme, Artus is best avoided.

It's as though a proven design team developed a game for intelligent players who prefer chaotic and tactical titles.  Artus is the result, and it's a tough game to love.  There's very little ability to plan a move until the beginning of one's turn. The delays transform a sparkling ride of chaos into a slog of downtime.  Artus may truly have the intellectual heft of chess, but good luck finding someone who will try it more than twice.

One play.  I liked it, but perhaps more as a puzzle than a game.  It was slow going, with little point to planning your turn in advance, and perhaps three players rather than four would be a better number.

In a four player game, you are very much at the mercy of the other three players. There is some planning you can do (get your pawns to the right of the knights with two rings which are likely to become kings, keep your knights spread out so you always have scoring opportunities, keep a good balance of knight/prince cards in your hand) however the game feels mostly tactical.

All that said, still an interesting game which I probably will not purchase but would play again.

'Artus' is a game based around trying to get your knights closest to Arthur at the round table whilst trying to prevent the other players from doing the same thing. You must use all the identical cards you have at the start before the game ends. Failing to play some incurs penalties.
I think it could have been explained better as my grey matter found it a little tough to take on board. My bad?

In Artus, the round table of legend is a turntable in the center of the game board with a space marked with a crown for the king, numbers on the edge from +10 to -15 counter-clockwise from the king, and a few spaces worth 0.
\13\\13\
Each player has six cards in hand – two knight cards, two royalty cards, and two scoring cards – and plays two cards each turn. By doing this, players are able to place figures of their color or neutral figures around the table, score certain areas or figures under certain circumstances, and place rings on neutral figures or to move them. The neutral figure bearing three rings is the current king, and the table is always oriented to place this figure in the crown location. A new king can come into power, though, which will find everyone sitting in a new location.
\13\\13\
The player with the most points after eleven rounds wins the game. Artus has two sets of rules: basic rules for families and casual gamers and "professional rules" for more experienced gamers.

This is basically an abstract game with a theme pasted on it. What somewhat sticks out is that you will use all your cards, including all your scoring cards. So you need to plan when and how to use your cards. However, I will probably never give this game a chance. Its too chaotic even at 2 players to develop any long-term plans. And you are not sure when you will draw what scoring cards. Its a puzzle that you will have to solve in a more abstract way - and I wouldn't have fun trying to solve it, so I think I will pass.

King Arthur, the Round Table, princes and noble knight, beautiful princesses, epic fights, mysterious secrets, big adventures and betrayal. Nothing of this you’ll find inside the box. Inside you will find an abstract game which is fun to play. Pawns person-ate knights, princes and king, but if you manage to do this, you will have a big imagination. Players hold four cards in their hand, on on their turn they can play one card. Basically there a 3 kind of cards. One to control the movement of your knights. One to control the movement of the princes or the king. And one to place a ring around a prince. By moving the king, the table will also move. When the table moves, the amount of points that knights and princes can score changes. This is a nice mechanic, and makes you to think a bit tactical.  After 16 rounds, the game is over. Player with the most points win.

With two players, this one plays in less then 30 minutes. With 4 players, this can become chaotic. I think this is best with two. Fun, very light, abstract, filler game of Alea.

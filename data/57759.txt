A very strange and clever game.  Each round is a combination of trick taker and area control.  Analyzing your hand to decide which way you want to go and then hoping that there isn't too much competition for it.  Shifting in the middle as players reveal their intents.  Holding back to shoot the moon as player fight for tricks.  

There's so much to this despite very simple rules.  I just wish the iconography was better.

Interesting trick taking game where the theme actually works to stand in front of the gameplay.  This is because it uses fruits from the region in the game, and they most happen to be yellow!  A bit more color differentiation would have been really helpful.

Based on 1 play of Tindahan with 5 players:

Trick taking meets area majority. There's potential here, but getting down a strategy for the first game was super hard. Knowing when to change trump came to me pretty naturally, but knowing when to lay down a cube instead of playing a card did not.

The area majority game is more like a little bonus rather than an equally valid way to score points. For this reason the game feels like the area majority aspect isn't really melded with the trick taking in a significant way, because 90% of the time the real reason anyone lays down a cube is to try and preserve their hand. Perhaps my feelings on this particular aspect will change after more plays?

Shutting out is interesting, but it doesn't get you the points going Nil in Spades does and it feels like it's more easily broken. Maybe I just need to understand when to go for this more.

Looking forward to more plays and trying out Bastos!

Tindahan: First player can either lead or change trump. If trump is changed, lefthand player must lead (and first player does not play the hand). After a suit is led, players may a) follow suit or play any other card if void or b) play to the market in an area control subgame. Points are earned for tricks taken and for area control. Points are lost for cards in hand when someone has played out.

The relationship between the trump movement, the area control subgame, hand-end timing, and the points for tricks make for some very opaque decisions for a trick-taking game. I'm very eager to explore more.

2 mindwarping trick taking games in one box.  I give Tindahan a 9 and Bastos a 7, although I can see the latter going up if I can figure it out.  So for right now, the box gets an 8.

Tindahan's mechanics were a little tougher to get used to because I'm not used to putting down a heeple (hexagon meeple) instead of playing a card in a trick taking game.  However, once I got by that, the strategies started opening up to me.

Bastos was a little more straightforward in terms of mechanics (just a little though!), however, after playing a 4 hand game, I still have no idea how to play well or even a good Bastos color to claim.  When the hand assessment leaves you confused, you know you don't have it figured out!

All in all, a great game to pick up.  NOTE: I have the Bambus version. Don't know if there's any difference between that and the Indie Games version.

RATING: 7
Either we're having trouble figuring out Tindahan, or it does not work well with three. In every case but one, the player who has caused the round to end has scored the fewest points; so, we avoid playing cards and, instead, go after the fruit stand bonuses. We need to try Tindahan with four or five, so that the value of taking a trick relative to the fruit stands is increased.

Bastos! works well with three and is quite interesting. For one thing, a bad hand is playable: you can 'go negative' and penalize the players who are taking the tricks.

Fun card game - with the option of saying "Bastos!" at regular intervals. Choosing your bastos suit is an interesting balance between wanting to influence the value of cards won and wanting to actually win tricks eg by leaving a long trump suit. However this process is somewhat negated by what suit others choose so you can overthink it. A nice game with an interesting twist.

Very portable little game.  Different.

2 games: Tindahan (Market Stall) & Bastos!

Tindahan: Easy rules.  3 areas for strategy: moving the donkey, placing sellers, or the card playing with its own strategy of which card to lead and whether to try to take the trick.  Card counting necessary for a good game.  Rate this one a 7.

Bastos! is the gem here with some amazing strategy present that I don't know exists in another game--You can slough a trump (which in this game is negative pts.)!   It involves declaring your Bastos! suit, which then gains in positive points, and which you are not allowed to capture in any trick.  Then if you have the opportunity to declare the trump suit which can happen at any point in the game and which every card of that suit is then worth -2 pts--if you play the trump on any trick with your Bastos card in it, you cannot take it with the negative pts (because it contains your Bastos suit) and it goes to the next person.  Very, very clever.  This is the game I have rated an 8.  If I can find people to play it, I can see this becoming one of my favorite card games.  Unfortunately it has a minimum of 3 players, and I suspect 4-5 might be the optimum--hard to find that many card players in a board gaming group.  Scoring is very low.

The scoring takes about as long as the playing.

The importance of randomness isn't equally distributed among each hand, which is rare in trick taking games.

Rating somewhat lower than it should be, mainly because I can tell that this is going to be difficult to get played.  All of these "trick-taking card games with unintuitive rules" tend to come out only once in a while, and you've inevitably forgotten how to play.  Which is a shame, since I'm sure most of these shine when everyone knows what they're doing.

I've only played Tindahan so far, and I definitely enjoyed it - I still have no idea what I really need to do, though I consider that to be a good thing and I wouldn't mind playing this again.

It's a trick taking game where 2 games are going on at the same time, area of majority and trick taking. Personally, I could not focus on both games at once, in my case, I focused on trick taking and did not bother about area of majority and I won without actually expecting to win.

I have played both games in this edition.  I much prefer and really like, Tindahan, the five-player trick-taking majorities game.  The deck has five suits (Filipino fruits) valued 1 thru 10 and each player has 9 wooden fruit traders in their color.  Most players will have two choices:  (a) play a color (follow suit or play trump/off-suit) or (b) place a fruit trader at the lead suit's fruit stall to win majority (1st or 2nd place).  Therefore, each hand can have ten tricks or it could even have 18 tricks, depending on gameplay or groupthink.  One of my top picks for 5-player trick-taking games!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I've played Tindahan and found it enjoyable.  Standard trick taking rules with a few additions of the option of changing trump as your action instead of laying a card if you are the lead player, and then other players can often play a cube in the lead suit which will score for majorities and runner up at the end of the round when someone runs out of cards.  

Played Bastos with three players and also found that enjoyable.  Whereas Tindahan pretty much needs five players to enjoy, Bastos is fine with 3 or 4.  Each player decides on a suit that will be an "action" suit where when s/he plays that suit s/he can change the value of a fruit by one up or down.  First player to play off suit can declare it trump.  Trump instantly drops that fruit by 2 points.  At the end of the hand, each card taken in a trick is worth the value as modified by play of "action" suit.  Interesting.

I enjoy trick taking games and both of these are different renditions/variations of trick taking.  Ultimately, didn't see much play time after purchase so it was traded away.

I played this once (the Tindahan "half") and offered it to my friends on the spot; none of them wanted it either. May it never darken my door again. This is only the second time I've ever done that (Iliad was the first); I hate this game.

I was willing to overlook the crappy components -- the fruit carts are terribly designed, especially considering the fact that the fruit cards are actually pretty nice -- until I actually saw them in action; that was the first strike.

At first there seemed to be enough interesting layers to sustain a game, but I found myself bored by round two and actively annoyed after that. It's not a festering, unplayable turd -- hell, there might even be a good game hiding in there somewhere. I'm just not going to waste more time trying to find it.

Two original trick-taking games. One has an area majority element, and in the other the scoring values of tricks taken vary during the game. After one session, the latter one seems to be the stronger of the two games.

The original German rules are somewhat vague, and the English translation is downright contradictory occasionally. The main problem is that it isn't always clear whether a trick or a round is meant when it says "round" in the rules. Also, in many of the unclear situations, the English rules are worded differently than the German rules.

The Tindahan variant can be a lot of fun. It's standard trick-taking, but with a bunch of twists. If you have a high hand, go for tricks because they're worth 2 points each (plus you effectively get a point for each card you play). If you have a low hand, instead of playing dead cards for a point each, play cubes against the suits led. Most cubes in each suit at end of hand scores 5 points, second scores 2. If you win a trick and you don't like playing no-trumps (which is what you start as) or the current trump, then forego the lead and re-set the trump. Costly, but it could be worth it. There's lots of ways to play a hand, making for good decisions with each trick. You also have the option to go for the highly dangerous but highly scoring misere, but be careful, because the other players can manipulate things to force you to lead and auto-win a trick (player on your right calls for a new trump, you must lead, others play cubes instead of cards). Anyway, quick to play, lots to like. 

The second variant, Bastos, is more about manipulating suit values. There's more to learn about how to play well, but strangely less satisfying. Points are awarded for each card won via tricks. Each suit varies in value between 3 and -2 dependent on how players move it, done each time they discard/play a hand in their declared "misery" suit. Which means your scoring fate is largely in the hand of the other 3 players who collectively have more adjustments to make thru a hand than you do. When you get to make your adjustments is also in the hands of other players, which will be less decisive if your suit is led early. So you tend not to concentrate your trick collections in one suit because that suit will no doubt dive in value and earn you negative points. All of which makes for a tentative affair where your result seems to be somewhat out of your hands. Tricky to play, which is good, but the lack of scoring control lets it down.

On top of trying to win tricks you also fight for majority on the cards in the center and can change the trump suit. You chose to either play a card tot he trick or add a token to the suit that was led as you fight to have the majority of tokens on the card. Tricks are worth 2 points, while majority is worth 5 (and second place 2) thus the majority on each suit card is often more important. Not my favorite trick taking game, but simple and enjoyable.

Filipino Fruit Market is actually two games.

1. Tindahan is a trick taking area majority game.  Two of my favorite mechanisms is one game.  Be still my beating heart!

There is a suit of 10 cards for each player and it plays 3-5.  It follows normal trick taking conventions in that you have to follow the lead suit if you can, otherwise you can play what you want.  Highest card of the lead suit wins the trick unless a trump was played in which case the highest trump card takes the trick.  But wait...there's more.  When it's a player's turn to lead a trick, they can lead like normal or they can change the trump suit.  If they change the trump the player to their left must lead the next trick.  When it's a player's turn to follow they can play a card as normal or they can place a token in the fruit stand of the lead suit.  The hand ends when at least one player runs out of cards.  Points are awarded for having the most and second most tokens in each fruit stand.  Also each trick taken is worth two points and every card still in hand is worth negative one point.

The novelty of the game comes from the area majority game in the market stands.  Not only are players trying to wrangle their way into taking the most tricks but they are also trying to manipulate the fruit stand availability.  For example you can play cards such that once you get a marker into a fruit stand that suit is never lead again for the rest of the hand.  It's a simple game but it's also a lot of fun.

2. Bastos.  (As Yano say, "May mura, pero mahal!")

Haven't played it yet.  But it's a trick taking game where each player chooses an anti-trump suit.  When a player plays an anti-trump card they cannot win the trick.  Another cool element is a fluctuating market.  Cards of each fruit suit are worth points at the end of the hand based on current market value.  Market value fluctuates based on card play through out the hand over a range of negative and postive numbers.  So it's kind of like a stock market trick taking game.  I definitely want to give it a try.

Something different in the trick taking genre that's fun and spices it up a bit is very welcome indeed. This certainly fits the bill. Good enough that it should be picked up by a major publisher for wider distribution.

There's a little bit of area majority mixed into a trick taking game without an opening trump suit. Tricks are worth two points and cards left in your hand are minus one each. You can forgo an opening a turn to change the trump suit. Again, forgo your turn to place a cube in the cart for the current suit.

Good trick taking game. Light and yet offering interesting decisions.

A traditional trick-taking game meets area control. The suits are fruits and there is a fruit cart card for each fruit in the middle of the board. Each player gets a number of tokens. On one of the carts is a donkey. The donkey sits on the cart representing the trump suit. The deck is numbered cards for each fruit, and every one gets a random hand to start the round. The game takes place in tricks, and every one gets one action per trick, then the trick is awarded to the winner. To start the trick, the leader can either play a card in any suit or move the donkey to another cart (in which case the player to his left must lead a card). Players then follow suit (if they can, otherwise they can play any card) or add a token to the cart of the lead suit. After everyone takes one action, the trick ends.  If a trump card was played, the trick goes to the player of the highest trump card. Otherwise the trick goes to the player with the highest card in the lead suit. The winner of the trick is the new leader.  If everyone still has at least one card in their hand, the leader starts the next trick, otherwise the round ends and is scored.

You get 2 points per trick won and lose one point per card left in your hand. Additionally, each suit awards 5 points to the majority holder, and 2 to the rest. If there are ties, the points are split, rounded down. Then the cubes are reclaimed, the cards collected and shuffled, and the next round starts. You can play a predetermined number of rounds or to a certain point total.

I kind of liked it. It is a clean merger of two mechanics, and a decent game. The game comes with two variants, and this review is for Tindahan.

The first of two games, [b]Tindahan[/b] is a hybrid of area majority and trick-taking. Playing tricks works as usual, but instead of playing a card during your turn, you may opt to place a seller on a select fruit stall. At the end of a round, players score for each trick they have won as well as for fruit stalls they have a majority of sellers in. While it may seem tempting to place a seller when you have no chance of winning a trick, you will be retaining more weak cards in your hand and reducing your ability of winning future tricks. 

One concern I have is that it is paradoxically easy and difficult to go misere in Tindahan. During a 5P game, a player pointed out it is easier for a player to dump his cards and go for broke. But, as stated in the forums, all it takes to prevent that is for the other players to gang up on that player and force a win out of him at the expense of 1 or 2 rounds. This leaves me a bit torn as the misere seems like a farce, but apart from that flaw Tindahan is a fine trick-taker.

The second game, [b]Bastos[/b], is trickier to grasp. This is a trick-taker with 'weak spot' suits and changing values for each suit. While players aim to win tricks, they also need to ensure that the suits they are winning have positive values, so a little work is needed to manipulate those values. Bastos is a little more difficult to take in due to several small but crucial rules which players are prone to miss out on. I will admit I'm not very proficient in trick-takers, and I find the strategy in Bastos to be rather opaque even after 2 games. So Tindahan gets played more, but it's nice to have double the value in one box.

I won this game at ConnCon 2010 as a play-to-win.  The box and small format attracted me.  I was also pleased to see that you can play 2 different games with the included materials.  We played only 1 of the games, Tindahan.

This is a trick-taking card game at its heart, which is normally not my type of game.  However, I enjoyed FFM.  Having only played 2 times, I felt like I wasn't "getting" the strategy, but that's a good thing.  I feel that there is more in this game than initially appears.  

I don't love the light-weight cubes, but they are certainly functional.

[Bambus Spieleverlag 09 edition] 

{Fruit; trick-taking; optimal 4p; 7 rating} Tindahan is an interesting trick-taking game.  It is new because a player has to control both the cards and the seller market.  A player with a bad hand can attempt to shutout to get good score.   Trick leader cannot send seller but he/she can control the trump suit.  The balance here is one will have penalty score if he/she doesn't play cards and focus too much on sending sellers.  In all this is an interesting game.

{Fruit; trick-taking; optimal 4p; 6 rating} Bastos! is a fine trick-taking game. Choosing a Bastos! suit is tricky.  It allows player to manipulate the market but it also reduces one's ability to win a trick.  Unlike other bridge games, where one can still get score with a bad hand, one can only get decent scores by winning tricks in this game.  If one has a bad hand, there is not much to do; one cannot even control the market price because one cannot lead a card.  Deciding a trump suit is somewhat chaotic - the trump suit only shows up during the game, which makes card play planning difficult.  In Bastos!, the luck is reduced by playing multiple rounds.  A typical game isn't short, it takes around 45 minutes to complete a game. 

The component isn't too great.  The box is pedestrian.  The card is colorful and nicely illustrated (though with the pineapple background).   The cubes are not nicely painted.

A box containing 2 trick taking cardgames.

[b]Tindahan[/b] is a mixture of trick-taking & majority control. Basically, in each trick you choose between playing a card or increasing your influence in the fruit that was led. Points for tricks plus 1st/2nd majorities in market, penalties for cards left in hand. Enjoyed our first play (with just 3). Keen to play again, and with more players.

Rating is for Tindahan only - I have yet to try Bastos!, although I've heard good things about that one as well. Tindahan is a terrific little trick-taking game where not only do players can earn points for taking tricks, but also for controlling majorities in the suits. To place influence on the suit areas, however, players must forgo playing a card during a trick round. Cards left in hand at the end of the round count as negative points, so the decision of whether to play a card or place an influence marker can be a tough one. The ability to opt out of a trick round by placing influence also gives players a ton of control over their hand ... it's impossible to "bleed" someone of a particular suit. An extremely clever and deep game, and one of the more innovative trick-taking games I've seen in some time.

Two solid unique trick-taking games. I enjoy Tindahan's "you don't have to play" aspect, along with the possibility of going for 0 points to ride on the winner's coattails. I'm generally not a fan of majorities, but it worked fine. Bastos has a cool market going on, where everything that's good for you is actually bad, and vice versa. Lots of cool tradeoffs, but a decent number of choices are practically made for you.

RATING: 6
Tindahan is about a 7 and Bastos! is about a 5, so on average this gets a 6. Bastos! is just too reminiscent of other trick-taking games, and there isn't a huge amount you can do with a bad hand. Tindahan does more interesting things.

Rating is for Tindahan.  Bastos is not bad, but Tindahan is far better -- definitely Tindahan has something new.

Essen 2009, one hand of each game.  I like trick-taking games, and I liked these.

Played Tindahan - the rules read a bit awkwardly in spots - at least for us, but after a few rounds we had the rules sorted and found Tindahan to be much more thinky than I initially believed it would be.  The decisions are very engaging, and the fruit market mechanism makes it a unique entry for trick taking games in my book.

TINDAHAN: This is definitely a trick-taking game, but it has some other aspects to it that make it different from the many, many variations on that theme that already exist.  To wit, the game has cards that represent each suit in the game (all five of them), and players may, on their turn, choose to play a cube to the card that represents the suit that led the trick in lieu of playing a card to the trick.  Cards left in hand at the end of the trick count as negative points at the end of the round, so players have to judge whether or not it's worth taking that risk.  In addition, the player who leads a trick may always choose to change the trump suit, again at the cost of not playing a card to the trick.  At first glance, these mechanisms sound chaotic, but there's more control over your fate that the summary suggests.  It's a neat game, and one that I look forward to playing again.

Trick taking game with two sets of rules. Probably not best with three.

Neat little set of card games. We played the better of the games and it was a good game.

Tindahan: I have yet to see a compelling reason for an area control mechanic in a trick taking game.  Yes, it is interesting, but similar to Krakow 1325 AD, that aspect resulted in something which felt more like a gimmick than a functional element of the gameplay.  I also found the variable trump suit to be a completely unnecessary addition.  More often than not it seemed to only serve as a way to pass away the lead, which to me is a very odd thing to implement because having control is important in trick taking games.

I played this with 3 and I don't think it was optimized for that number at all.  If two people fought for control of the market then the third person will continuously win tricks with just a single card.  Same thing happens if the market is left uncontested.

Honestly, the mashed-up mechanics just don't work well.  I kept hoping there might be more strategy to the game but simply could not find any.  What's going to be next?  Tile-laying with trick taking?  I shudder to think of the possibilities.

[b]Tindahan[/b] [b][bgcolor=#9999ff] 6 [/bgcolor][/b]  This was kind of interesting.  The choices presented are some nice fresh options for play; however, I'm not sure I like knowing every single card that's in play.  I'd prefer having a few cards out of play each round.

Enjoyable, but nothing too spectacular. Though I would like to have some more plays, just to be sure. At least Tindahan has plenty of beating opportunities, but maybe that's the idea :)

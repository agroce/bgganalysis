Clunky.  You never really get to fully try out your deck before the game is over.  Awkwardly tries to make a co-op into a competitive game.  

Good ideas.  Poor execution.  Game is way overhyped!

A superior gameplay experience to the comparable DC, but them this is a purely co-operative game. Like most deck building games that have had even the slightest thought put in to them, it's highly enjoyable and has a delightful theme.

Relatively light, but great theme, solo play, and replayability. Perhaps a too easy and I could see how it being a co-op and competitive at the same time is flawed, but overall I enjoy it. Will have to check out the Dark Cities expansion next.

Similar to but WAAAAAAAAAY better than Ascension.  This has a great theme and much more interesting game play with the multiple card lines, villains, etc.  Fantastic art.  

Maybe not quite as much theme as Sentinels of the Multiverse, but it also plays a lot quicker.

This is a fun deck-builder, but the MSRP is too high for me to snap it up. It's a bit daunting to set up as well (I suppose you would keep your cards well stored to avoid this). There aren't alot of combos that I've seen, but could imagine a bit of that - especially when you focus on a single hero or team. However, it feels too easy to beat the bad guys (I hear that changes in the expansion). I'm a huge fan of Marvel comics going way back, but this one has too many misses for me to want it on my shelf. It is certainly better than the DC deck-builder.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Good, but I recommend getting Villains if you are not a completionist - it is a much more balanced game as a base set and thus it does not require expansions to shine.

Egyike azoknak a modern játékoknak, amivel talán a legtöbbet játszottam. Egyszerűen IMÁDOM - 9 csak azért, mert vannak sajna megcsinálhatatlan kombinációk (hősök-gonoszttevők-sztori -góré), amivel hiába görcsölsz próbálod ezerszer is újra, olyan szintű csillagállás kell ahhoz, hogy nyerni tudjunk benne, hogy azt akár már nevezhetjük lehetetlennek is. 

One of those modern games, I've played the most. I Simply LOVE it. I gave it a 9 'coz there are some deck-combination (Heroes-Villains-Scheme-MM) where you just cant win. You could try it as many times you wish but there is literaly no chance to win.

RATING: 7.5
I had high hopes for this game, and after four plays it has been a bit of a disappointment.  There has been a lot of talk about how the game is too easy when played strictly as a coop game, and I must disagree with that.  Of my four games, three have ended in a loss for all the players (well, 2 were losses, one was a "tie" with the villain deck being exhausted before the Mastermind could be defeated).  I would think the players in my gaming group are pretty good at deckbuilders as we play them fairly regularly, so I don't feel like we're playing poorly.  I think instead the issue is that there is high variability in the difficulty of the game based on a number of factors: the Mastermind, the Scheme, the Villain deck composition, and the Hero deck composition.  This makes it very hard to estimate the difficulty of a particular game setup.

Now, all that is not to say that I dislike that the game is hard.  I don't mind losing at coop games.  However, I don't feel like this game works as a pure coop because there is very little player interaction.  There is very little players can do to help the other players.  It feels a lot like multiplayer solitaire - coop style.  And after those first four games, that doesn't feel like a very good way to make a coop game.

Having said all that, I'm still rating this one as a 7, though that is liable to change with further plays.  Right now, though, I can't say whether I expect it will go up or down.

UPDATE (1-5-13): I got in two more plays of the game (both at 5 players, both saw the mastermind defeated), and for the first time we decided to count points after defeating the mastermind.  I feel like this did add a bit more excitement to the game.  I feel this game is lacking when played as a pure coop because there's not much players can do to assist each other and there's not much discussion to be had about strategy.  When played semi-cooperatively, I think it becomes a bit more interesting.  Overall, I still think the game is good, but not great.

UPDATE (11-6-13): After a year, an expansion and numerous plays, the game has earned a bit of a bump in the rating and a move up my [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/143773/admiralacfs-game-rankings]game ranking geeklist[/url].  All of my previous comments still apply, I've simply come to enjoy it a bit more.  It's a fun game and I like bringing it out every so often.

+Excellent artwork.
+The board is very well done and adds a lot to the gameplay.
+The card effects are nicely thematic.
+Lots of variation in setups makes from lots of replayability.

=Doesn't work well as an entirely cooperative game.
=High variability in difficulty level.
=Numerous reused card images (this can be helpful in cleaning up the game).

-The deck-building system requires some thematic abstraction.
-Limited card buying options reduces strategic depth.
-Setup and tear down time is long compared to the time it takes to play.
-Dividers are unlabelled.

Deck building is one of my favorite mechanics. Between this being a deck builder, cooperative, and Marvel theme, this is just a big winner for my husband and I. We have house ruled it to be completely cooperative and not the semi cooperative mentioned in the rulebook.

A fun cooperative deckbuilding game.  I enjoyed this quite a bit more than, say, ascension, but the theme didn't really do it for me.  The game was a bit... long... for what it offered I thought, and I'm not particularly dying to play again but I wouldn't refuse it.

very fun game. I really enjoy feeling like your in the comic book doing the fighting but your not relegated to being a individual character. This game is also family friendly as most of my family is not into comic books yet they still enjoy the way the game plays. If you enjoy deck building games like Dominion, Trains, Eminent Domain....then give this game a try.

RATING: 8
I have had a blast exploring this game. You could say that you are building symbols and colors into a deck, but if you know the comics, it really connects thematically.  (ex: the Rogue cards that let you copy other cards).

The original game is good, but the expansions really cranked it up a notch with better thematic flair, more challenges, and better artwork.

The one gripe is that the later expansions make the original masterminds in this game much weaker.  I think you have to house rule to add strength to them.

Did not enjoy.  Both four player games, multiple people started getting weaker and then kept getting stomped, and one person got strong and kept getting stronger, cleaning up the entire board.

Neat concept, but did not enjoy the spikes in both directions.  Also did not enjoy the number of lost turns, where you can't do anything except discard your cards and draw a new hand, and then get hurt by villains.

RATING: 7
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

Legendary Marvel never caught my interest, maybe due to the fact that I'm not a big fan of either deck-building games or superheroes. Also, even if I'm not usually a theme guy, the mechanisms of this game and its theme seem like they couldn't be more disconnected and that further reduced my interest in the game. Now that I tried it, I can definitively say that my second impression was true: there's really no theme here. Yet I was surprised to see how much I enjoyed this game.

On the plus side Legendary Marvel is a game with rules that are pretty fast to explain and mechanisms that are easy to grasp. Like Dominion, it's also a game all about deck-optimization and combo-building and a lot of satisfaction can come out of that. On the other hand Legendary doesn't really feel like a cooperative game. Sure you have common objectives, but there's really not a lot you can do to help your teammates. Many times all the cooperation you are capable of is to leave a card for another player to buy or let someone else defeat a particular enemy.

Yet I find this game enjoyable. It flows smoothly, turns come back quickly, the game doesn't take too long and it's satisfactory to personalize your strategy to overcome the challenges that the villain shoots at you. Furthermore you get a lot of variety and re-play value just with the base game and there's a lot of expansions that can add to that. I still might not love this game nor its theme, but Marvel Legendary was a pleasant surprise for me. I would gladly try it again in the future. Thumbs up!

It is a good game, with, of course, a Marvel superhero theme well explored in the deckbuilding mechanics. Well, it uses a similar deckbuilding mechanic than Star Realms with cards combining with each other by symbols activating even better powers and I enjoy that.

What I didn't enjoy, and prefer Sentinels of the Multiverse than this, is that you actualy don't play with one superhero, you play with the combination of them in your own hand, playing solo may make this feel better as you control all the heroes and it is ok. But with more people I prefer each one controlling a superhero and, combining one with each other, beating the supervillain and the scenario, and this, Sentinels of Multiverse does in a much better way than Legendary.

RATING: 10
Best deck building game IMO. All others that I have played end up becoming combo fests where no one really cares what others are doing and they are just racing to see who can get to finish line.

Legendary forces you to interact as a team which adds a great dynamic. You are helping each other as well as hindering each other depending on the time of the game. Perfect twist to the deck building genre that in my mind was getting very stale.

Also love a lot of the flavor, but I do admit some is random or forced.

Set up time is the only real fault of this game and once you are experienced it shouldnt be difficult at all.

The game was interesting, I'd love to play it again. The main con that I have with the game, is that it seems to ends too soon, but it was my first game, and I have not played a lot of Deck building game, and it may be a lack of experience on my part. 

However, I love the way the theme is built into the game. It was more immersive than I expected, and this is what I loved about the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My current favourite deck-builder and since I'm such a big Marvel fan, the theme will likely forever keep it at the top. The card strategies and synergies make every play different and I can see myself heavily investing in the expansions as I hear they only make the game better and better with each one. It's just a solid cooperative game with a slightly competitive edge for those who like going after the most points. Love it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I like deck building games.  They also usually make me fairly angry/salty/frustrated when I repeatedly pull out my combo cards with nothing but starters or I have to discard the one card that would have made that hand epic etc...

This game is very take that, but it is the game attacking you, not the other players. I can groan and chuckle with my allies and they can swoop in and help when I get destroyed by some bad luck.

I really should get another big box expansion for this, I hear civil war was great, but I am still happy with this and don't get it to the table enough. My game wishlist is also bursting at the seams, and there is never enough money or time.

Bought it for my son who loves Spiderman, Hulk, Thor aso. It is a good game, easy to get into, fast to play. My son loves to fight the evil villains and with his 7 years is able to built powerful decks. 

Wasn't sure if I should get this or DC but due to my love for Marvel and my son discovering my old comics it was an easy decision then.

The rules seems solid and the rulebook answered all of my questions. They lead you thru your first game and help you to set up a game fast. Well done. Waiting for an expansion with the Fantastic Four and the Silver Surfer.

My rating for Legendary has really fluctuated over time. I'd give my first experience (base game, 2 player) a 5, but with expansions and/or 3 or 4 players, it's a much better experience. 

Setup/put away time is still a major issue that keeps it from getting to the table more often.  

Luck can also be a factor with some schemes, but not really much different than getting a run of good or bad draws in pandemic.

Where the game really shines is in theme.  The mechanisms are tied well to the theme, and if you like Marvel, this is a good game, but only after adding one or more expansions (unless you like easy co ops)

Pros
- Marvel superheroes

Cons
- The cards for heroes are all the same. Booo!
- The theme makes little sense. I guess you're SHIELD recruiting heroes? It ends up feeling dry. 
- A rather long setup time for a deck builder
- It's a co-op and also not a co-op? It doesn't make sense, really. I guess the best SHIELD agent wins?

I absolutely LOVE this game. This ranking includes the rating with several expansions. I have really gotten into deck builders of late and this is the best. The amount of variety from the types of heros you can add to you deck(each hero plays completely different) to the villain decks, masterminds and schemes all combining for different experiences really makes this a fast playing, infinitely replay-able experience. The game does require some organizational skill on your part to help with set up. I also highly recommend the app that lets you randomize scenarios. Most important expansion is definitely Dark City. I also love the Villains box though this one certainly complicates the game quite a bit. Who doesnt want to play as Magneto, Venom and Ultron?

I love everything about this game.  The deck building aspect.  Working as a team.  The thought that goes into each of the themes.  Plus the expansions add something different with each one.  Will be playing this for years to come.

I love this game--it's fun, and the cards that come with even just the base game add a lot of variety between plays. The art is awesome--especially some crossover art (for example, the Mystique card where she is turning into Iron Man is amazing). I've also found this is a good game to teach to people who don't have a lot of experience with games, because the artwork is tantalizing and the gameplay is exciting.

We like Marvel comics and we like deck builders. So this one was a no brainer to get. But the theme just isn't as strong in this one as say Sentinels of the Multiverse though it is actually a better game. But there has been an upswing in the play with this one. Liking it much more with expansions. The only real problem is that it is hard to set this game up randomly like you can with most deck builders because doing it that way you end up with Masterminds involved in schemes that make no sense. Can you see Galactus trying to take over the Daily Bugle?

Dominion meets Marvel. It's a team version of Dominion, the players against the game's super-villains. Fun to play, but the card art needs more variety. I love superheroes, so I like this game more than Dominion. I can't wait for more expansions.

Es un juego entretenido pero analizando las partidas que he jugado le veo algunos puntos negativos:

- El setup puede ser muy farragoso

- No veo demasiada personalización de superhéroes. Sí, hay muchas cartas de ellos, pero al final son un poco todas lo mismo, comprar o atacar con algunos matices... además, cada jugador puede tener cartas de todos los superhéroes a la vez... eso particularmente me disgusta pq la gracia estaría en llevar cada uno a varios con exclusividad sobre sus poderes y habilidades.

- Si te gustan los comics las ilustraciones del juego te parecerán un poco flojas y además algunas se repiten mucho (las del juego básico).

En la parte buena:

- El juego es rápido y divertido. Partidas de 45 minutos.

- Para varios jugadores funciona bien (pero 3 máximo, pq con más puede resultar muy lento)

- Pese a su mecánica simple, la gran cantidad de cartas le da cierta variabilidad para que no resulte repetitivo.

One of my favorite co-op deck building games to play. It is easy to learn, but offers plenty of exciting game play no matter what level of gamer you are. Building a deck/team of superheros from the Marvel universe makes for a fantastic theme. Can not recommend it highly enough.

Rules are fast to teach and gameplay is very exciting. Because of only 5 heroes are  avaivable, it is sometimes rather dull just to buy the best card you can afford and move on... But because of huuuuge amount of different scenario/heroes/villains/mastermind -combinations game stays fresh. Love the theme. Will play this many years to come. Best with 3-4 players.

Mostly played as 2 player and twice in a group of 5.

So far it is great, lots and lots of options to try out, obviously some combos are better than others.

We've lost a couple of times on a random setup - Both times we have been missing a key hero type that was required for either the Mastermind, Scheme or Villain effects. It makes it tough to keep up with the game when that happens. No less fun, just more of a challenge 
A couple of close calls by a single card! 

Replay value is fantastic, very happy with it. Might be a little easy so far with the standard setup. Might have to try and use the higher difficulty rules.

Great thematic deck building fun, I do feel like the Legendary Encounters goes a little further, but the original Marvel version is almost infinitely expandable, atmospheric and fun co-op. I think Sentinels of the Multiverse is still my go-to superhero card fix, but this, the DC Deckbuilder, the Dice Masters sets and VS all honor their IPs and I'd happily break out any of them to play. I plan to pick up all the expansions.

RATING: 7
3/21/16: Rating is based upon initial play.  Rating may go up with additional plays.

A semi-cooperative game.  Takes the deck building mechanics found in Ascension and Star Realms and builds on them. You start with low level fighters and recruiters and build up your deck.  It has a nice theme and the good artwork.  The characters are the Marvel Heroes that I grew up with.  You fight the bad guys and build up strength to fight the mastermind.

Has a nicely laid out board, and the insert is built so that it can handle sleeves and expansions.  

Plays well with 3 or 4.  Have not tried with 2.  There is a solitaire version available.

RATING: 9
This is a really fantastic game that I rate highly largely due to the variety you get game-to-game. With expansions that just gets bigger and bigger. My only complaint, and it isn't even such a bad thing, is that it can sometimes be frustratingly difficult. There are some villains that are just incredibly challenging, and require masterful coordination and/or the perfect hero set up to defeat. I consider myself and my play group very experienced board gamers, but we have gone many games in a row getting defeated by the same villain, until we finally are forced to pick "only the best" heroes in order to defeat the boss.

As I say, this isn't that much of a problem. Challenge is necessary for co-op games, but I do feel certain cards could have been balanced better to make them more strategically viable against some of the tougher villains.

My major gripe is that putting the game away is a huge pain in the butt.  The cards are all mixed together, and you have to separate them out again for future games.

RATING: 7.5
Bought by a friend, Legendary is a deck building game by Upper Deck. Players have the ability to recruit heroes into their deck by utilizing recruit points and fighting points to combat villains. The game comes with different schemes and different masterminds to vary the game. Each scenario is unique with different henchmen, villain groups, and heroes that can be recruited for the fight. I find that the game is pretty fun with the right company. There are even variants that allow for variability, and the game also scales according to the number of players. Certain situations require more thought-out plans, but one thing is certain, you must defeat the mastermind at least 4 times to call yourself victorious. The setup can be quite time consuming at first, but this game is definitely fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.4
Initial rating, based on a single (extremely frustrating) 5-player game, in which both the scheme and the mastermind required the same type of heroes, of which there were very few in the game, our HQ was stuffed right from the beginning with super expensive heroes, most of the enemies were too tough, and we'd each picked up 4-5 wounds before the game had gotten properly under way. Rating probably will go up a bit with further plays, assuming those will be less unbalanced, but that the game allows for this level of imbalance means I'll never rate it very high. I don't care too much for the superhero theme either, and in general I suspect I'll consider this a flawed copy of Ascension, with particularly the very small market being an extremely limiting factor, making luck play far too large a role.

RATING: 5
A fairly well executed deck drafting game that ultimately fails for me in terms of scalability and tension. In all my games, I've never felt worried about the outcome of the game. Because of the lack of tension in playing against the plot, the semi-cooperative element seems to be the only weak driving tension in the game. There's also an illusion of replayability because of the shear number of heroes in the base game. Aside from mixing things up with the heroes and villains (and even then), the games feel fairly similar: start slow, be patient, build up your deck and then kill everything in sight with ease. 

While the theme is extremely attractive, ultimately the game play doesn't hold enough interest to make this a keeper.

A Dominion-Thunderstone vonalat követi, csak Marvel hősökkel. Sok újat nem mutatott szerintem, sőt szinte semmit. Aki már játszott a felsorolt játékok valamelyikével, annak nagyon egyszerű lesz a szabály. Nagy az újrajátszhatóság, mert pl. mindig csak 5 hős szerepel a 15-ből. Egynek jó volt, de ebben a kategóriában szerintem praktikusabb a Star Realms, mert 10-ed akkora, sokkal olcsóbb is, és töredéke idő alatt elő- és elpakolható. Egyedül a Marvel fanoknak lehet jobb ez szerintem.

As a fan of the Marvel Universe, i really like the game. True, the game does not give you the impression you are one of the heroes involved, more like controlling the synergy between them, which is somewhat of a shame..but i dare say that it is one of the most interesting non-coop deck builders around (and in my collection up to this point)

I'll start with my small complaint- I find this game hard to visualize themes at times, for instance when you attack the Red Skull it lets you gain another 3 attack for the turn to be used against other enemies. What am I supposed to think that means?  Aside from this, this game has made it to the table FAR more than any other game I've owned in quite a while. It honestly doesn't need a theme at all to be fun, so I suppose it's a bonus that there is any theme at all. I can't wait for the expansion because A) it doesn't appear to be more of the same just to suck your money, there are improved game elements that didn't exist before and B) it'll give hours and hours more playing time to the game because you're adding tons of new combinations to play with.

Fun, fun, fun! My favorite way to engage the Marvel universe in the tabletop format. This game gives you a toolbox to let your imagination run wild, and each expansion gives you more to work with while fitting seamlessly into the existing game. Add Villians and you blow the roof off of the game! Great solo play, and it's easy to vary game length by adding or removing players under your control. Not many tough decisions, but the play is fast and furious, and has pretty strong thematic content for deckbuilder of this style -- if you're willing to supply just a bit of imagination.

RATING: 6
Initial Impression: The artwork for this deckbuilder is topnotch. There are a good representation of Marvel characters in the different power ranges. The theme, however, doesn't seem to sync well with the game. Why does everyone control the same set of heroes? I think this game plays best as a fully cooperative game as often one person must sacrifice a potentially good buy in order for his teammate to take advantage of it.

After 1 play:
Played with 5 people and thought that the game ended too fast, we barely had any turns to really develop our decks and build combos (and see them show up).
The theme may not be mechanically strong, but with all the artwork and the vibrant colours the whole Superhero thing is there. And it helps to grasp the game because you're most likely familiar with most of the heroes (unlike in Dominion where the name of the card and its effect only have a very loose connection, it any)

The semi-coop, the whole "Everyone won, but X is the better winner" just doesn't work for me (and probably never will).
We had a chat about that semi-coop after our play and I was told that there are only so few cards that really build on the coop-idea.
Furthermore there was no need to help each other as the villain had "Difficulty: Walk in the park".
So all in all, coop feels really like an after-thought was was quickly tacked on.

While less challenging than Legendary: Villains, it laid the basis for a marvellous gaming system.

Marvellous solo deck builder in a great comics setting.

Highest production value.

Remark: the score is only for the Dark City and other expansions. The basic Legendary box is too easy but combined with the expansions and the rules in the Dark City it is a solo gem !

After more than 3 years, this game still is very fun to play as you can have a random set up through the internet and difficulty goes way up if you can't choose your heroes.

Only negative: too many expansions. 5 or 6 would have been ideal.

A cooperative deckbuilding game with a marvel theme.  Overall the objective is to take down an evil mastermind before they beat the players.  At the end of the game you can add up the victory points of the enemies you defeated and determine who the "best hero" was.  It's a rather fun spin on deckbuilding - more like ascension than dominion as far as gameplay goes.  Really almost a combination of ascension and LOTR.

Wow, just wow! Immensely entertaining and thematic. Only drawback to the base game is the art on the cards, which is the same for each hero card. I love trying different combinations of heroes against the different masterminds, schemes, etc. There is near endless replay ability in the base box alone. As great as Legendary is, it gets even better with the expansions. Fantastic solo experience as well! Must have for co-op game or comic book fan.

This game amazes me.  It is simple, yet I play it and I am fully satisfied.  There are very few games that can do this for me.  It is the only game in my large collection that my wife, mother, and myself all love.  All the other favorites of my wife and mother are too light to be one of my favorite games.  I highly recommend this one to gamers who occasionally play with families or friends who are light gamers.  It is one of my favorite games.

Great first solo play. Excellent art and the components are high quality. Board is particularly substantial. Might need to sleeve the cards, but there are loads (500+), so it could get expensive!

Mechanics are good and the gameplay has considerably more depth to it than the DC Deckbuilder, which is good and has been a favourite, but I've got a little bored with it myself recently. I think the kids will pick this up pretty easily, and being more into the Marvel universe, I think the theme will be much more to their taste. I suspect we'll need to get the Guardians of the Galaxy expansion soon too as they're currently a bit obsessed with Groot and Rocket.

better than ThunderStone:Advance

PROS
-it has quicker set up and tear down time.
-makes more thematic sense and has way better thematic approach.
-upper deck quality and great artwork.

Cons

-still setup and tear down is longer.
-what em i fighting? the players or the game?I dont like this concept at all.
-again luck of the draw can be crucial.
-if you draw high level villians at the beginng it could be depressing.
-easy YOU WILL NEED DARK CITY SOOON

For me the theme kept this game so high.Big fan of the comics and with these graphics and the feeling of fighting of bad guys its just great.So the rating is i would play it but not buy it.

But all this deckbuilding mambo jambo as a gameplay mechanic is soooooo boring to me and just lucky.Now high hopes for star realms.

Tons of replayability. 4 Masterminds, 8 schemes and 15 heroes. Not to mention random villain groups and henchmen.

Solo is built is with very little changes in the rules.

The theme is very well represented. The only negative I can see is the repetative art on the hero cards. Mind you when you have all the cards in play with the various decks it doesn't matter much. The board is well made as well and has merit as a gameplay aid tool.

Overall amazing deck building card game.

(Update: 1st multiplayer session - 2P)
Losing faith in this games ability to reach the heights that I've experienced with Knizia's LotR. Really want to try this with a larger, more enthusiastic group to see if it can redeem itself, but I really have my doubts about whether this game can have a good interactive flow and escape the mechanical feeling I had this game. Positive about this play through is that the game felt easy and light, welcoming almost (a plus as a gateway game) didnt overstay its welcome and had a theme that was waiting to be embraced. So not a complete loss, but a more limited audience than I was hoping for upon acquisition. 

(Initial Rating: Based in two two-player solitaire games):
Definitely feels lighter than the average deck-builder which might be good or bad. Good for non-gamers. Boring for the average gamer.

+1.0 points for theme and the scenarios, enjoyed the setup and how they played out mechanically.

I will say that the complaint I read about where players can opt to keep building up their deck rather than attack the Mastermind causing the game to drag on for way, way, way too long particularly for a game that's so light.  In certain scenarios there should almost be a mandatory rule that if a player has enough power to attack the Mastermind, they must attack him. I could see it thematically as the Mastermind, themselves, learning of all this power the heroes have accumulated and confronting them, only to be rebuffed.

In my second game, I squandered a chance to defeat the Mastermind "mid-game" resulting in my decks becoming clogged with "recruiting" cards that prevented me from attacking at full power resulting in a long drawn out "escape" of the bad guys. A scenario that would be embarrassingly painful to me with the groups I normally play with: non-gamers that are still being convinced that games are short and fun, along with gamers that have little patience for overly light games that last for two hours.

However, I do hold out hope for this game and will cautiously try it with my game groups because of how the first game I tried played out.  

The general synopsis of the game was that Magneto's master strikes were well countered by the three X-men in the hero deck, but the team struggled throughout because of the tech required to counter the the wounds inflicted by the Legacy Virus which also acted as a countdown to Evil's victory This lack of tech was personified by Black Widow's cards. That's it. 

The way it played out, one deck ran lots of attack and strength cards taking a lot of wounds, crushing the other deck (42-21) as well as the Mastermind (3-1). But what really made it a standout game was that the "winning" deck couldnt have done it with the second deck running the "wimpy" Widow that happened to have the only power (tech) that could slow Evil down long enough for Good to actually win.

So even though, technically, it was a slaughter, it was actually a "team victory. It just depends on how you look at it.

And in closing, I have to say that I enjoy the characters that now and than whack their "friends." I've read a lot of complaints about it but that's actually a huge plus in my book, right along with the classification of this game as "semi-cooperative." Lots of the guys and gals have huge egos or darkness in them, not to mention some mental or emotional instability. On the surface it can be annoying at the least and dangerous at the worst, but at the end of the day it's who these character are and sometimes it's the reason they are so powerful in the first place. Or like the Hulk, they both come from places so intertwined that there is no way to separate the two. This game would be painfully bland without Deadpool screwing with everyone or the Hulk smashing everyone and everything, now and then.

Easy to learn, difficult to set up and break down. High replay value. Take on marvel's villains while assembling your team of heros. Different scenarios, villains, and heros each time you play. This game keeps you coming back to see what kind of combos you can create.

This is absolutely my favorite deck builder bar none ! I love all the mechanics ! It does take a while to set up but that's because of the endless combinations for almost every facet of the game so it'll never be same any 2 times you play 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
After a few plays everyone I played with says they will definitely play again.  The different scenarios and masterminds vary the difficulty quite a bit.  

The only quirk is that shuffling the villain deck to have an even distribution is key.  Other than that the integration of the rules and the theme are excellent.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I love super heros, I love cooperative games, and I love deck-building in Dominion!  So this game should have been a homerun! Plus it's got the Marvel license so it includes my favorite characters. Yet somehow my first plays just didn't completely grab me. For one thing I really don't like the solo-win style of cooperative game. I want to fully work together, but we have to compete. My other big problem is the way you draft cards to your deck. With Dominion I know what's available, so I can buy early planning out my later strategy based on the other things that are available. Here you buy a card from the five face-up and hope later you find others that work well with the early ones you bought. Not to mention the fact that you have to just try and remember what the actions were on the early cards you bought. Yet it still has some neat stuff going on. I liked the thematic connection some of the cards made, and the variety of the villains/schemes you will face is nice. I'm not abandoning the game yet, but I wish it had just a little bit more fun to it.

Only played it 2 player so far and it seems like a decent game but it didn't really work well for two.  It was waaaayyyy too easy.  I'm looking forward to trying this with 3 or 4.

I've played it with 3 players twice now.  Both times with my young kids, but they rolled with it and enjoyed it quite a bit.  I still feel like this has the potential to jump to an 8 when I get a chance to play it with adults.

Just one play with an adult and with 2 players, it isn't an amazing game for adults.  However, with my kids, this game is a total winner.  We can usually destroy the villain with 2 or even 3 players, but we still get to compete against one another to see who was the best hero.  I'm happy with how much my kids have learned how to organize their decks and make the best of them.  It is now an 8 for me and I have all of the expansions.

The familiar heroes just add to the fun of the game and I feel like the thematic integration of those heroes into the strengths and weaknesses of the decks and how they play is very clever.  This is good stuff!

RATING: 8
Legendary has now been used with other I.P.s but the original marvel version is still very fun. Players play cooperatively and deck-build to try to defeat a villain during a particular scheme that villain is trying to pull off. While this is only a step or two pasty what games like ascension do, the cooperative aspect works very well and the art and theme comes out phenomenally well. The base game comes with plenty of heros and baddies to allow for a lot of replay-ability. 

My main issue with the game is that sorting the cards and setup can be a bit of a burden and it would be nice to see a better organization system to help with this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Yeah, this is just ok.  I'll play it, but there are other deck builders I prefer (Eminent Domain, Dominion).  It feels very swingy, I never have a strong sense that I'm in control.

RATING: 8
I'm a DC guy, but I really love this game for the flexibility to mix themes and all the schemes to keep the villains fresh.  I have not played the DC one but I understand that you often end up with oddball things like Wonder Woman driving the batmobile, so that's kind of a turn off.  I love that this game (at least some of the time) draws the card powers from the comics of the character depicted.  I like that the shuffling isn't to bad, and I love the theme.

I really couldn't get behind this one despite being a huge marvel fan. It felt so limited. Yes, you get 15 heroes, but per game you only use 5, so you end up with 4 hulks in your hand at one point and it just doesn't make sense? Surely the behemoth that is Disney could hire a bigger and more worthwhile designer to produce a better board game than this? Dominion is themeless, admittedly, but at least it flows well, this is just a halfway house.

I have heard the Alien Legendary is a far better game, but I can't say I will pick it up after feeling that this one was so weak.

This is a favorite of my wife and nephew. The solo game is also pretty strong. There are times when playing with certain people can try my patience as they just make the game drag out.

Well this one isn't going to get any awards for depth, or brilliance in new ideas.  It is though a simple (ish) and rewarding deck builder, with a good franchise to draw on.  Major hate though is the set up, and take down time (compared to other DB'ers)

What can I say life long marvel comic fan and this just feels like being right there in a comic. I do need to improve my shuffling skills though, as in my first play through with my daughter about 6 Scheme twists were batched together in the middle of the deck. The glares I got from her over that. Thought we were done for but still managed to scrape through!

I'm totally hooked!  I really like that villain effects KO your starter Shield heroes - makes sense. Playing out the narrative/ generating awesome combos makes for memorable moments.  This game is very well designed for the theme.  
I like the art and I'm thinking its easier to pack the game up and organize the cards because the images on the cards of the same hero are so similar. Scheme cards should have different/unique art though.
I do enjoy playing this solo and after playing with some guys at the local game shop I had to bump this up to a 10

RICHARD OWNS THIS ONE

This game is very good!  But it's not as "Co-Op" as we first thought.  It really is a race for victory points, just with a co-op lose condition!  Don't let that chase you away.  Still a very good deck builder

I put this on my wish list so as punishment for my sins, a friend bought out from under me! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game play is fun, addictive, easy to learn, and fast.  I recommend it for the game play.

However, it doesn't have the replay value, customization,  or depth of strategy that Dominion has.  Since Dominion is the original deck builder game, it is the standard against which all other deck builders will be measured.  Legendary falls short.

Also, it seems Upper Deck has production issues.  Some of the card backs are not uniform, some are bluer than others.  The cards themselves don't seem sturdy enough to stand up to the rigors of repeated shuffling.  And for goodness sake, why can't they help with the organizing?!  The cards fall everywhere.  Borrow a tip from Dominion and have a place for all the different segregated card types.  Yes, they give you dividers, but they are unlabeled and just fall loose like everything else.  You need to add your own means of spacing, organizing, and protecting your cards.  As a result, it takes a solid 10 minutes minimum to set up a game and another 5 minimum to strike it afterwards.  If it weren't for these issues, I'd probably rate it a 9.

It's worth playing a few times, but ownership is a maybe.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I rate it a 5/10 if played strictly according to the rules. Especially in the solo play this game is either far to easy or unforgivingly hard and with certain deck combos then even totally unbalanced.
But with easily implemented house rules this game could be a blast........(rating 9/10).

RATING: 6
Coming from the Legendary Encounters Alien franchise I was a very disappointed with this one. Escaping villains are almost meaningless or even a good thing to shake up the HQ. The tension seems to be much higher in the LE system due to the fact that you can actually die. What I liked slightly better with this one was the overall deckbuilding mechanic as there seem to be more KO effects to streamline your own deck. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Why 7.... Can be a 8-9 if you want a verses game rather then Co-op game.
Does not work well has co-op.

So many cards.... you will have to find a system to store them. Core box is okay, once you start adding the expansions, you will find you have to set up your own storage system. I use index cards and it works great, all the cards are in two boxes.But sooo many cards...

Enjoyable game, will take a few plays to understand completely. It is not complex, but there are many things that are altered with certian skills the cards have. Like Phasing and Teleport, and all the dozens of little symbols mean. But once it clicks it sticks.

So many options, but really they are all the same. Draw cards til you or the game wins. There is much more there but there is so many random things, and was to set up that the core is what is the same every time and that core is draw cards for game and you, winner is the one that is luckiest draw,

Few issues, you're on same team, but you're also not on the same team? It is like they were not sure if it was a co-op game, or a verse game... so they made it both and it does not work as either. You lose the game because you can not help a player beat an enemy even if you have the card they require in your hand. So the whole team loses because you can ot help the others. Only real way to help others is not take cards they want, or ask if they have a card in hand before attacking someone that will require that card.

Legendary is great fun to play, and this is the one the family always plays, they do really like the game. These bad elements mostly are listed because if you can look past these then you will love game. IF you do not care for the theme, then maybe pick up Alien version has this is my favourite of the set and works much better game play wise. Just seems the family prefers marvel for its setting, so it is what is played more times then not.

Full disclosure: I like deck builders.  When I heard about a semi-coop deck builder, I had to try it out.  Legendary didn't disappoint.  If you're not sure you like deck builders, try Star Realms first or Eminent Domain: Microcosm.  They're less expensive introductions to the mechanic.

Legendary is more fun that is has a right to be. The deckbuilding isn't that sophisticated. The theme is not integrated quite as well as I'd like...but it strangely works. It helps to have a buddy playing who is into the universe, of course. The game just slides along so smoothly, there is just too little downtime to gripe. The little combos are fun; the different personalities of the different superheroes are fun; hitting the super villain hard is fun. The game is just...pleasant fun... in a way that games with more gravitas and ambition sometimes just aren't. I think buying the Dark City expansion is obligatory; it seems to kill pretty effectively the semi-co-op element of the game which the base set has that never worked for me (and others). Recommended - with the Dark City expansion.

So I played through this a few times so far.  I played the solo version a couple times and really enjoyed it.  I also played a two player game playing as both people and really thought it was a fun game.  

I really enjoy deck builders and co-op games and it also has the ability to be competitive with who can get the most VP by beating the most villains.  

I have played Sentinels of the Multiverse and really didn't care for it at all...I think it may have been a little too hard (maybe we drew a hard boss and with two of us playing for the first time it made it really hard).

 If you are looking for a good deck builder other than Dominion (Which I do love),  give this one a try.

Just recently got this and have gotten around 10 plays of this game.  Very enjoyable, though did not appreciate the intro adventure and find it to be the worst scenario in the game.  
One of the reasons that I WANT to play this is because of the Marvel Super Hero theme to it.

The theme carries this game.  It is a very simple deck builder where the right choice every turn is pretty much a no brainer.  That being said, it can still be fun ride from time to time.  Has to be played semi co-op, otherwise it is too easy without expansions.

I played my first game solo. I had to wait 3 days with it in my possession to play it because of all the holiday stuff going on. I thought I was going to burst. :-) I am glad I got it, but I was a little disappointed in the depth of play and the lack of different powers and combos. The only thing this game has over Sentinels of the Multiverse is the license. There is a lot of potential here and I hope Upper Deck will take the time to advance this to the game it could be.

**************

I played 2 more games with other people and I have increased my rating by .5. The first game was fairly tense and we lost when there were only 6 cards left in the villain deck. The next game was not tense at all and we defeated Magneto in short order. I think some of the knack for this game will be knowing when to add difficulty in the right situations to create a tense and therefore enjoyable game.

**************

While I still agree with my initial comments above, my disappointment is waning. I have seven games in so far and I do like the game a great deal. The license really helps me to enjoy the game. I look forward to additions and hopefully we won't have to wait overly long for them. :-)

While the base game gets boring itself, once you collect some expansions it only gets better. This game also hits the table a lot more as its an easy deck builder but the theme is something a lot of even non-gamers can find interest in. Set up can take some time (although labeling dividers helps a lot) and it isn't necessarily a short game in my mind but for the most part is always fun. This especially worth it if looking for something a step above Dominion.

The game is okay. The theme really feels tacked on. I've played it about 7 times, and I'm still not sure if I like it or not. In my opinion, the game feels really confused. It's a coop and there is one winner after the game is over. I'm wolverine in one round and so are the other players. I really wanted to love this game; I chose it over Legendary Encounters. After playing this, I'm not sure if I even want to risk spending the money on it.

RATING: 4
Production values are a bit lackluster- same art on different cards is kind of jarring and the board is ugly.  Really long setup time for what it is.  Theme is tacked on.  As far as gameplay, it's ok but nothing special.  The decisions and chaining cards together don't feel as satisfying as in Dominion- which I'd much rather play.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Surprisingly fun. Plays fairly quickly and feels like I has more options than many deck builders. The theme is handled very well and the mechanics are well-designed. The difficulty seems almost laughable with 1 or 2 people, but really cranks up with 3 or more. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
My main gripe with this game is the lack of art variation on the cards. There are 14 cards, and 4 different versions of each, but they use the same exact picture for every iteration. It just feels lazy for a game that is so expensive. The same goes with the Masterminds and Scheme cards. They couldn't have used a picture of the Cosmic Cube for that scheme? They had to use the same Spider-man Villains picture that's on all the rest of the cards? Stuff like this makes the game feel cheap and when you are trying to immerse players in a world, it's weird to see little things like this not happen.

I guess playing Vs. all those years spoiled me.

RATING: 6.5
Decent co-op/competitive evolution of Dominion. Great theme and artwork to the cards, and everything fits together well. However, absolutely nothing felt fresh about this game- all the mechanics we've seen in other games and implemented in a more original manner. 

On top of that, unlike Dominion there is a far greater amount of cards being removed from your hand as a result of game effects (heroes being 'Feasted' on, etc.). This  lead, for me, to a much more frustrating injection of luck than other similar deck building games. Multiple times early on in the game I had my best card which I had just bought and never used, be the top card that got "KO'ed" and out of my deck. I then was never able to get any kind of powerful cards in my deck until it was far too late and we were only turns away from ending the game.

Not bad, but no desire to purchase myself. I would play again but only if there was nothing better opening up at another table.

Edit June 2015: Replayed a few times more as a focus game at EBGL. Definitely felt more enjoyable this time around, bumping to a 6.5.

Legendary is one of the first games I played as I started to get into board games. The game has a ton of replay ability with all the different heroes, villains, schemes and more. 

The game is easy to teach and everyone that has played it has really enjoyed it. The fewer players you play with the easier it is to win. When it is just my wife and I playing without any expansions we always use the modified rules that are available on this site to make it more difficult. 

Overall, this game is amazing and I would not trade it for anything.

Theme doesn't interest me.  The box is just a bunch of cards.  I felt like I was just pushing paper around for no real point.  The characters could have been anything.  I didn't feel like I was doing anything superhero related.  I can see how people like it, but not for me.  Did enjoy it more after a fun game with friends, but not enough to raise my rating.

RATING: 7
The artwork is fabulous & if you've played Dominion before, then you won't have any problems picking up on Lengendary's game play.

I love the diversity that 4 different masterminds & 15 different heroes give the game, and it would seem that it has high replay value; however, the setup / take-down (in particular) is a pain, and quite honestly it's highly unlikely that you'll lose a co-operative game.  For that reason, it's probably best to either stack the mastermind deck, select your villains, start the game off with at least one wound (instead of a SHIELD trooper), or some combination of all the above.

I bought this game for one reason alone: nostalgia. I spent a lot of my childhood reading Marvel comics and I love the Marvel universe. I do not care that this is not the greatest nor the most complex of games: I simply have a lot of fun every time because I love to immerse myself in the superhero theme.

A fun co-op deck-builder. I love the scheme mechanic and playing as all the Marvel heroes. For a co-op game, it would have been nice if we had more ways to help each other and work as a team. I would also have liked to see the various locations in the city be more significant.  Because it has a competitive element to the co-op, it also can cause frustration when a game is on the line and players don't act in the interest of the team.

Just acquired this week.  First play went well.  Looking forward to trying it again soon.    With :d10-6: plays under my belt I can say this about the game thus far: it is a fun game and while it may not be enormously challenging (yet) it is still just FUN! :cool: :thumbsup:  My wife and I have enjoyed all the games we have done so far and are looking forward to future plays.  While it may not be as involved as some other games I say SO WHAT?  It is fun to be the heroes, build your deck, and try to hammer the villains.  So if you are looking for a fun game with superhero themes, this is the ticket!
Record of game with my wife is 14-6.

Legendary is broken. It's because it's a "competitive co-op" game, rather than pure co-op. This generates a huge free rider problem. The player who spends the whole game ignoring the mastermind and just going for the personal-gain villain kills will win. Seriously, go ahead and try it this way. Just let the other players kill the mastermind while you concentrate solely on your own VP. If everyone loses, oh well. But if there's a winner, it's damn near sure to be the most selfish player who helped the least on the mastermind. That's a broken game design in my opinion.

Now, if there was a way for the other players to screw you over and/or kill you for not helping enough, that would partially address the mechanical problem, but would only break the thematic aspect even more than it already is. There ARE ways for other players to harm you, but not enough of them to make a difference.

Oh, but it can be played as a pure co-op, which should solve the problem, right? Wrong. Pure co-op play would give you no incentive to go after the villains at all, just the mastermind, which turns it into a 1-dimensional game. In fact, it actually HELPS the players when villains escape, because you K.O. a hero from HQ, which means you can thin the pool of the heroes no one wants to recruit anyway. Seriously, the game is designed so that it helps the players when villains escape. How is that thematic?

Legendary is broken, both mechanically and thematically. I don't say that often about games, but I think it applies here. I won't likely play it again.


EDIT: Oh, and setup/teardown sucks. Seriously, it takes damn near as much time to construct all of the fiddly decks here and there and to break everything back apart later than it does to actually play the game. Long setup and teardown isn't usually a showstopper for me, but it's just the cherry on the shit-sundae here.

It's a deckbuilding game.  As far as those types of games go, this one offers some noticeable differences, particularly coop.

Update: I didn't give this game much credit originally but it stands up surprisingly well compared to other deckbuilding games. The mastermind/scheme mechanic adds variety in that the method of play has to adapt to succeed.  I've increase my rating from a 7 to an 8.  It does suffer from a long setup and cleanup time however.

Not bad. A cousin to Ascension, but with Heroes and Villains coming out of separate decks and on separate tracks. Feels similar to Ascension but with the distinct twists of a cooperative game. Does require some tracking of whats in your deck though. Only snag: almost unreadable fonts. The size isn't notably worse than anything else (1mm x-height), but the text isn't always on a light background, it's often on a darker or noisy background that can make it very hard to read even in your hand, never mind at a distance. Even the icons are needlessly small. I enjoyed the game, but I would have enjoyed it more if it hadn't literally (literally) hurt my eyes to read it a lot of the time.

RATING: 9
While the game doesn't do anything revolutionary with the deck-building genre, it boasts a refinement of gameplay mechanics that makes it, in my opinion, the king of deck builders. Dominion is a great game but the theme is a bore. Thunderstone is awesome too, but the theme in Legendary and the way cards combo off each other blows the former out of the water. 

The different schemes alter gameplay nicely from game to game. I especially like the Skrull Invasion scheme which puts heroes into the villain deck and allows you to add them to your deck once defeated. 

I had to take a point off for the poor quality of the components, the board and cards are all made of very cheap materials. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
IMHO, this is far superior to DC Deckbuilding game for a comics fan in that the various schemes and the use of the city track create a narrative — whereas DC has fantastically thematic individual cards and a fierce little game engine, but lacks that story element that I really enjoy in Legendary. I'm also firmly in the camp that this game is a cooperative game with a competitive element, exactly like Defenders of the Realm and Castle Panic. Others have argued this heatedly. To each their own. I've played the game dozens if not hundreds of times and enjoyed it with 2-4 players. It is in my Top 10.

Not too often does a game hit a 9 right off the bat. Even Power Grid had to build from an 8 to a 10, but Legendary deserves the 9 rating, and maybe even higher if it can maintain my interest.

This will get a lot more gameplay each month me hopes.

I don't see a lot of decisions in this game that aren't obvious. It kind of plays itself. There really isn't much interesting going on in the player cooperation either, making it the most solitaire cooperative game that I have played. 

That said, it plays quickly, is innocuous and is kind of fun. Building your engine to attack the bad guys works fine. It's a theme that holds no appeal for me, but for comic book people, I can see this being a fun diversion.

Rated for play with kids with adjustments to Mastermind strength to make the game more challenging (and longer).  A deck builder that's simple enough for kids to enjoy and just deep enough for adults to as well.

The game's difficulty is tied to the number of players.  During games with more players, the players don't have a chance to build their decks as quickly for the same amount of elapsed villain cards.  Since victory is tied directly to elapsed villain cards, you can see how the game becomes more difficult with increased numbers of players.  I've not seen a perfect solution for this, but the game is fun none-the-less.

I really enjoy Dominion, and was excited to try a different deck building game, but was disappointed at the quality of game play in Legendary.  The game has a great theme, but not much else.  The friends I played Legendary with are big comic book and Marvel fans and really like the game, but aesthetics and the theme of a game are not important to my game experience.  So here are some of my issues with Legendary.  
Some villian groups complement certain masterminds better than others, and if you are going to truly be random in picking the heroes that go into your pool of cards be prepared for a mastermind basically countering some of the heroes that are selected.  The game is unbalanced, either too hard or too easy (depending on how many people are playing), and has a tendency to stagnate early in the game.  Most heroes have powerful cards that cost a lot of recruitment points, but many times a couple of those cards show up early in the game on your helicarrier and no one can buy them, so you just try and make do with less card options until you can clear those cards out.  Almost worth K.Oing them which is a shame because they are supposed to be the awesome cards in the deck.  

Overall This game could have been good if they had worried more about the mechanics of the game and less about the theming.  Also they Should have gotten rid of the "semi co op" style of the game.  It doesn't add anything useful , and detracts from the already loose co op mechanics of the game.

This is probably not going to set your world alight if you've played a deck-builder before, but there are some clever ideas in here (i.e. the wide variation of schemes from a relatively simple ruleset). Plus, I'm a sucker for superhero themes, so it gets a thumbs up from me :) 

Word of warning - DON'T play this like a straight co-op as it's far too easy (unless you want to buy some expansions that increase the challenge...or just get legendary alien instead). Compete for points and it's much more fun.

The reason I joined BGG was to find out more information on the legendary games (since they are a little pricey). My wife and I both enjoy several video games but this is the only board game that the two of us continue to play months later. We have this one as well as the 75th captain america. With everything they give you there is tons of replay-ability though the different masterminds, schemes, as well as villains. I recommend getting it if you can find it cheaper then 60 bucks.

   Of all the deck-building-games I love, I love this one the most. I started playing this before I knew anything about super-heroes at all, and still I immediately fell in love with its fun and elegant mechanisms. The game can be played both cooperatively and against each other, but as a coop it falls flat. 
   On the other hand, it did spark my interest for super hero comics and nowadays I buy far more that I have the time to read. 

I have heard a couple of times that this game can take a long time to set up and take down, something I and the group I play with highly disagrees on. Some people just need to get organized.

RATING: 7.8
The packaging is awful and nonsensical. Don't be blind sided and offput by it - Just break everything down to matching pictures and don't try to figure out the arrangements.
Remove the notion of cooperative villain-bashing aside.
This game is like Dominion in that you build your deck to get VP's. The game's bosses are like Providences - they're worth more and when they're gone, the game is over.
All other villains are like a duck shoot at a carnival, point grabs.
It is like Ascension in that the card pool shifts as the other players acquire and defeat cards - so it's not the best for planning out turns while you wait.
The final/epic/most expensive versions of the Heroes can be overpowered - Hawkeye nerf please?
With that said, the game is fun and creative. Some of the hero designs are downright genius. Our final game of the night told an excellent story that'll stick with me for some time. I can easily see this as one of the games people will talk about after playing.

Favorite deckbuilder I have played. Way better artwork than ascension, way more thematic than Dominion and actually a great gateway game for a deckbuilder due to the theme. Expansions galore that are at least interesting and at best great additions. My favorite superhero game, but that's because OverPower is expensive to get, I MIGHT trade it as they're so many expansions and many of my favorites it seems to be left out of the cold (Elsa Bloodstone, Moon Girl and Mockingbird).

Solid mechanics and theme, but I find that I prefer the "Legendary Encounters" (Alien and Predator) versions of the game because they allow you to play cooperatively.

Fun game but man the packaging for this game is the worst I have ever seen especially for the price.  No labeled dividers and the the plastic box insert does not hold cards in place for travel, A dominion like insert or even the nightfall style box w/ foam would have been a welcome improvement.  The reason I point out the organization issue is that it hinders an easy setup and needless to say there is a lot of mixing of cards at setup time.

RATING: 7
This is a pretty good mixture of game mechanics from both Dominion and Thunderstone. There is some seriously cool stuff here, however, elements such as the city and hero recruitment are under used or could be tuned better. A really good first effort, which I think will benefit greatly from expansions. 

At this point, it's a solid 7. I think with more plays and some expansions it could become a serious contender with Dominion.

This is currently the favorite game of the owner of the copy I play. I really enjoy it when the difficulty is at the right level.

While the set-up and breakdown is very tedious, I thoroughly enjoy this game.  No one will nominate this game for the greatest of deck builders, I believe it is the theme absolutely grabs me.

Decent game - another deck builder but with a slightly different mechanic. The game is semi co-op in that you have to stop the villains winning, however all the heroes are still competing for points, which adds an additional dimension.  

The setup time is what really works against this game. It just takes too long to setup due to the card sorting required, and too long to pack up. You might get more efficient with it over time, but it will still take longer than average. What would have been 'just another deck builder' is actually 'just another deck builder that takes 5x as long as all the others to setup and pack away.' Won't be getting this one.

So far so good.  A bit of coop, a bit of Ascension, a bit of its own thing.  It has room to improve for sure, but at its base, I enjoy it.  I hope further expansions give us decent dividers and different art on the different cards. This is comics after all.

The iconography on this game is just terrible.  Way too small.  They had the room on the cards to improve it, but they decided to go with very tiny graphics and text.  This really needs to be improved.


The price-point is atrocious on this one.

Fun deck-building game, mainly co-operative but can be played to find out a final victor at the end of the game.

For theme alone, I was sucked in, as the artwork on the cards just sings Marvel.  Plenty of cards to choose from, which adds a ton of replay value.

Similar to other deck-builders, draw to max hand limit, try to utilise buying power to acquire best combinations of cards to suit your playstyle, and attack visible enemies to knock them out.

Have played one game of this where one person wouldn't take any advice, and just bought randomly (which affected how well everyone else performed).  As long as you don't have anybody like that around, you should have a great time.

I don't really like co-op games that much.  I thought I would like this one more since you still have the chance of "winning", i.e. scoring better than another player, but I found the theme sadly lacking with almost no flavor as far as game mechanics was concerned; the gameplay numbing and repetitive; and worst of all, the downtime between turns was just killing me with a feeling of horrible boredom.  Dominion and Star Realms are much more satisfying as deck-builders.

 What smacks me the most about this game is the THEME, I have never played a game that immerses me into its world more than this one. My friends and I feel like we are in the Marvel comics battling the baddies game after game. Highly recommended game but it may take a few plays before you can really start to appreciate it.

Great deck building game for Marvel fans. Lots of variety with expansions.
Best to play with up to 3 players. 4 is fine but can be pretty difficult with certain Masterminds and villain combos. Playing with 5 can be almost impossible against stronger foes as it takes 10 turns (2 each) before anyone starts getting their good cards through. Definitely worth the investment in expansions with Dark City and Guardians of the Galaxy being our favourite.

This game is really nice. I get to pick 5 sets of heroes and send them against famous villains from the Marvel universe in various scenarios. It's a nice co-op game which scales well, as most deck-building games do.

The thing is, since I don't really read the comics, I didn't connect to this as much as I had hoped I would. It is a great game, especially if you are a Marvel Comics fan, but I really wish I could connect to the theme more.

I described this game as "cooperative Dominion set in the Marvel universe." That has been enough to pique the interest of several of my geeky friends.

What I really like about this game is the straight-forward rule set. There aren't a lot of little exceptions you have to worry about, so it makes it easy for even the novice gamer to catch on quickly, and over time they clue into powerful card combos. I also like that you can change up the characters and villains so each play feels different.

The only real downside I've seen so far is the 2-player game is too easy, but it sounds like certain expansions can up the difficulty level appropriately, so that's great. All in all - two big thumbs up. This was my must-buy after the big gaming weekend with my brother.

SOLO PLAY:

1 Player Minimum
5 Player Maximum
I love the theme. I love the co-op. fun game. After playing several solo games with 1 hand I think it is broken and not balanced to truly play solo. Now I solo playing 2 hands like a 2 player game.

Rules Notes:
-BURROW: If the Streets are empty place the defeated enemy in the Streets, unless they started in the Streets.
-CIRCLE OF KUNG FU: X of circle means that Villain had +X fight unless you reveal a hero of X or more. Example: "5th Circle of Kung Fu" means that Villain has +5 Attack unless you reveal a Hero with 5 or more cost.
-ESCAPE: When a Villain gets pushed out of the city. 
1.) Discard a Hero in the HQ with 6 or less cost. 
2.) Each player discards one card in their hand for every Bystander attached to escaping Villain.
3.) Activate Escape effects on escaping Villains card.
-SIX CARDS: drawn each turn.
-FOCUS: May pay the cost on the left side of the arrow to get the effect on the right side of the arrow as many times as you want.
-HEROES: Starting Shield Heroes count as Heroes.
-RISE OF THE LIVING DEAD: Each player checks the top card of thier Victory Pile. If that card has Rise of the Living Dead trait...that villain renters the city. Mastermind Tactics never return this way.
-VERSATILE: May either be Fight or Recruit. Choose when played.
-WALL CRAWL: When this hero is recruited, you may place it on top of your deck instead of your discard pile.

I like the way they've structured the opposition in the game - the combining of an antagonist and a nefarious plan (each of which affects deck composition and victory, and has its own special event every so often) with some other mix-in elements looks really nice for creating a variety of interesting setups with a different feel.

The hero part of the game is... functional. It serves the purpose of making the game go, but basically felt like I was playing Ascension: The Marvel Edition. Interesting choices were vanishingly rare in the early game (purely due to what I drew from my deck) and never seemed to get beyond "infrequent" even in later game. And the game takes a lot longer to set up / break down than Ascension does.

The semi-cooperative nature didn't sit well with me; I like it in other titles, but here... eh. [Addendum after 2nd play: it seems like it's required in order to maintain tension / interest when games are obviously not going to be lost.]

I might be willing to play again - it wasn't totally un-fun, at least when played in a reasonable span of time - but all in all, I think I prefer the gameplay of Sentinels of the Multiverse, both for thematic alignment and basic interest in the mechanics. I certainly wouldn't mind if Sentinels' villain design used some of the ideas that Legendary brings to the table, though! (In all fairness, their Environment decks do some of the same good things.)

I have played many deck building games over the years, but this is my personal favorite. The art in the base game is a bit of a let down, the expansions get much better there. Being a big Marvel fan I also this this game does a great job with the flavor of each hero. I would honestly rate this even higher but I think the game plays better once you add a couple expansions (especially some of the big box ones). Once you have at least Dark City and maybe a small expansion or two I would put this at an 8.5.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Components: The artwork is nothing special. It's not the best Marvel art I've seen; it's not the worst. But the graphic design is terrible. The board is unnecessarily huge, but with mostly just a blah background. The one place where some thematic attention was given, the five villain locations, actually looks too busy once villain cards are on those spaces.

The card design leaves a lot to be desired. The power and recruiting symbols are in the same location on the card, which causes a lot of confusion. The recruitment cost, which is only used once, is enormous, whereas the other information, used over and over, is small to miniscule. I guess the idea is that I need to be able to see the cost from across the table, but after that I can read it up close in my hand. But I need to read what the card does to know if I want to buy it, and even in my hand the symbols in the top left and the special power text are way too small.

The rules are ambiguous on many points, especially with regard to playing cards from my hand.

Experience: Still waiting for that great superhero game. This isn't it. There is no tension during my turn. I play all my cards, use their full recruitment cost, their full attack power, all their special powers, buy a bunch of cards, defeat a bunch of villains, rinse and repeat.

The only two interesting decisions were which icons to specialize in, and whether it was worth the risk to go up against the Hydra (who reveals two additional villain cards). Fighting villains seemed to have mostly positive consequences, layered on top of the fact that we were already winning.

Is this really supposed to be cooperative? Seems like it couldn't make up it's mind. It's virtually identical to Thunderstone in skeletal structure, but with the added caveat that we could all lose. Doesn't seem much different from Terra and Defenders of the Realm in that regard.

The super powers are mostly lame. The game has too simple a core engine to sufficiently differentiate the heroes. Thematically, some of the mechanisms are really cool. I like how the villains can capture bystanders, and someone like Spider-Man (as opposed to Wolverine) is able to rescue them. But what does Cyclops getting rid of a card have to do with activating his power? And Wolverine drawing cards when he gets riled up doesn't really fit with the idea in the comics that he works best when he works alone.

The mastermind scheme mechanism, similar to the advancing threats in Space Alert, is great in theory (except for the fact that we can see his entire plan ahead of time, which doesn't fit with the theme), but here doesn't result in being very interesting.

The baddies are pushovers. After the first few turns, we were regularly beating two villains a turn. The punishment for a villain escaping is a non-factor. Wounds were seldom seen.

Seems a lot like a mass-marketing effort to cash in on a popular game mechanism, but relying more on the Marvel brand than on fun play.

Initial rating: 9. And that was just off one solo game that I lost on the final card draw. I can see how fun this would be with multiple players, and how much replayability lives in this one box. To say nothing of expansions. Upper Deck, you've hit a home run.

This is a game that really impresses me and that's coming from someone who's not a big fan of super heroes or comic books.  What impresses me the most about this game has to be the sheer amount of replayability it offers with the different combinations of heroes, villains, masterminds, schemes etc.  Add one of the numerous expansions and you can play 200 games and they'll all be different.
  The artwork on all the cards is phenomenal as well and get even better with the expansions that add different artwork to every different hero power.  A lot of people consider this game their go-to deck building game and I understand why.  I highly recommend this one.

Great deckbuilder in the vein of Ascension and it reminds me of the good moments of Dominion too. The Marvel theme is both really good and really wonky at the same time, it feels weird to not be in control of an individual hero and instead it is more like issuing commands to a group. Theme comes through really well for the villains though and there's a ton of replayability. Expansions are great too, Dark City in particular. Recommended.

RATING: 9
Legendary is one of my favorite games of all time. Deckbuilders are my favorite type of game and putting Marvel with it was a huge win to me. I love the theme and feel of the game (although I'm not a comic book nerd, so I don't necessarily know the connections with all of the heroes and villains). I could play this just about any time a group is looking for a game, and when they're not, I'll oftentimes pull it out to play solo when I can.

There are some cons, but it's up to you whether those cons are enough for you to avoid it. The base set is pretty easy once you get mechanics figured out. If you want a game you'll win most of the time and you just want the challenge of outscoring your friends, then you won't care. Part of the fun for me is the very real threat of losing so I would highly recommend Dark City as a go to expansion as it adds a lot more variety and ramps up difficulty. Also, playing with 5 players is possible, but it gets pretty long and slow at times. Also, you really start running into each other as you try to recruit your heroes. This can happen with 2-3 players, but it's easier to work with each other to stick with a specific hero or two to optimize your deck. Sometimes with 5 players, you're really just left with either wasting a turn, or taking that one hero that doesn't totally fit your deck and that someone else really wants. 5 players is also tough in that you have to draw through 10 villain cards before the group has gone through their starter decks. Depending on the shuffle and villain groups, you could potentially have 5 villains escape before anyone can even hope to touch them. We do a house rule to help offset this if we have 5 and we just skip drawing a villain on our very first turn so that we at least have a shot. To me, the sweet spot for this game is 3 players, although 2 and 4 can be equally fun. There is some randomness to the game so if you hate that, this might not be a great pick for you. To me, it's part of the challenge as I can't just go build my deck how I want while ignoring other players (ex. Dominion). Also, I like the art, but I know that some of the female characters can be a bit over the top with cleavage, huge boobs, and super tight outfits. If you're familiar with the comic versions of Storm, Emma Frost, Rogue, etc., then this won't be a shock. You can Google the artwork if you are concerned about that. I can see how some might not want their 14 YO son staring at some of the cards.

There is no perfect game and everything will have some drawbacks. To me, these don't impact me enough to keep me from playing it over and over. I've played it at least 100 times and it doesn't get old because there is SO much replayability due to changing the scheme, mastermind, villains, and heroes. I used to play this over lunch at my work. The 4 of us could play a game consistently within an hour (Plus 20 min setup and tear down).

RATING: 1
Not a super fan of Marvel (I only know the most popular super heroes) so that might have affected my perception of the game. A lot of the cards just felt kind of random in the sense that you could have pasted a bunny and said draw 2 cards and it wouldn't have changed anything for me. But that is probably me not knowing the heroes. So in a sense it felt like Dominion with a super hero theme pasted on. (which is probably true for most deck building games, dominion with X theme). So while it could be interesting and fun, it felt very dry for me. Same as dominion. Something I did enjoy was the master mind and the "plot" (forgot what they are called). The Co-Op seems interesting, but didn't do much in the games I played and I think it can bring problems. 

Would play again if persuaded but I won't jump in a game if something else is available.

Played it again and I really dislike this game. Way too random and broken.

This is an enjoyable game, despite my movie-only knowledge of the comics. Unfortunately, set up and takedown time are long.  If I were a bigger fan of the characters it might be worth it but as is, it's not worth the time to me. I much more enjoy the Legendary Aliens game.  In that one the play value makes up for the extra time needed.

A deck builder for people who like Ascension I suppose. I'm not one of them. The choices felt mostly obvious, as there just aren't a lot of choices to make to begin with. It's never a good sign when I think that I could be playing a 6p game solitaire and get a nearly identical result. At least it's fast.

Anyway, I'd pick [i]Sentinels of the Multiverse[/i] over this every time, and it's not like I'm a huge Sentinels fan.

My only experience with Legendary so far is as a solo game,

The expansion, Dark Cities, really tightens up Solo Play making it much more of a challenge...and is required IMHO

Fun basic game in what has become a long series where you play SHIELD agents and Marvel superheroes fighting against one of several super-villains (Dr. Doom, Magneto) and his army of henchmen and henchwomen. The only major drawback is its abstractness: you're not an actual hero like Thor or Spidey, but some sort behind-the-scenes manager.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My 7-year old and I play this almost obsessively.  It also comes out regularly with our adult gaming group.  It's easy to customize each game to play more cooperatively (harder to win the game overall) or competitively (make the villains a bit easier to beat so it becomes a race for victory points).  Or just randomize everything - which can be very dangerous and lead to a quick defeat.

It's worth getting every expansion to add more heroes/villains.  I won't get anything that is not superhero themed.  (Aliens for example).  The game seems perfectly suited for the Marvel universe.

There is one Mister Fantastic card though that seems overly powerful.  Regardless, this is an easy "10".

This game is hugely enjoyable and has masses or replayablility even without expansions. Any person that loves superheroes and card games will likely love this. I really enjoy the deck building aspect of the game, it's really straight forward - the cards give you fighting power or recruiting power. The only downsides are the set up and put away do take a long time and the weird semi co op element where the person with the most points win. We generally house rule living or dying as a team.

After 1 play can't decide whether this is a 6 or 7.  I'm going with the 7 because it is very thematic.  It is fair to compare it to dominion, but it is just a lot more fun.

A surprisingly fun deck builder, with a light cooperative element.  Players represent members of SHIELD, starting with a hand of officers, but quickly drafting heroes into their decks.  The object is to defeat the game's mastermind four times, which hoovering up villains and henchmen, rescuing bystanders, and trying not to all lose as a team as they go.

Simple, intuitive, Ascension-esque game play - good fun.

I was apprehensive at first - I didn't want this to replace [thing=102652][/thing] - I loved sentinels the first time I played it, and thought "If Sentinels did Marvel the price would be double, and you would still have  a great game".

My first plays of [thing=129437][/thing] were solo ventures.  After a couple games I found it a pushover, and had to ramp up the difficulty just reach the 50/50 win/lose mark.

I have played it with 2, 3, and 5 players.  The game gets progressively harder with the more players you have.

This game is really good deck building game, perhaps not as complex as Dominion, but I think its more enjoyable, and I prefer the superhero theme to the land baron theme (just my opinion).  Those familiar with other Deck building games like the affore mentions Dominion or Ascension, you start with a small weak hand of cards and buy cards to make it better.  The mechanic works great for this style of game, and I love the cards, even though the artwork is a little repetitive, that didn't bother me at all.  However, there is only one small problem that you will have to deal with if you decide to buy this game, and they will probably fix in later expansions, but for now, its up to you.  And this is in scaling.  What is scaling?  I believe the range of players for this game is 2-5, with added solo rules as well, so lets just say 1-5.  The game is basically harder the more players you have, similar to other co-op games like Pandemic and Forbidden Island.  Like those games, the villains go every time a player goes, and in the beginning before you build a decent deck to start fighting off minions, you have to let a few go.  In a 2 or 3 player game its no big deal, in a solo game, its nothing, but in a 4 or 5 player game those guys are going to start stacking up quickly, making it harder and harder for you to win, or even get a shot at fighting the mastermind.

So, to fully enjoy this game, you can either just play it with 2-3 players, OR, you will have to take care of the scaling issue yourself.  BoardgameGeek offers several fan variants for making solo play harder, and other variants to make the first few round of 4-5 player games manageable.

The first time we played this was with 2 players, and it was a cakewalk, and I said, this game is too easy, then I played a few solo games, and it was even easier, so I change a few rules to make it harder, and then when we played with a 4 player game, we lost badly with the new rules, switched back to the original rules we won, but there were a few close tense moments.

So, take home point, this game is amazing to play, I find it much more enjoyable than Dominion or Ascension, but playing it with 1 or 2 players, you may need to add a little challenge otherwise, it will seem too easy.

Played my first game of Legendary. Since I am a comic book fan, I love the theme. Since it's another deck building like Dominion, and I have played so many kinds, some how the game was a bit flat, but that's just me. Maybe it needs to be replayed to have a better understand of this version of deck building when comparing to another.

Update:

Played 3 games in one afternoon / evening. Got a better understand of the game. Even won the 3rd game. Like it more this time. Played with the expansion.

Fun sandwich!  I haven't really enjoyed playing games since I played Concordia (see comment) back in February.  Legendary has reignited the spark and has reminded me that great games don't have to be clever, innovative, mind melters; they just have to be fun.  Thanks Legendary!

I enjoy deckbuilding games and the theme of this. My only complaint is when you have attack, but cannot hit anything. There needs to be the equivalent of the cultist in Ascension.

[b]Edit (8/14/16):[/b] Supposedly a cooperative game, but played more like a competitive one. Ultimately, I got rid of this because the setup was a pain and there are much better deckbuilders to play instead.

Legendary is mostly cooperative deckbuilding game with a shifting line of cards and combat/purchase resources ala Ascension. The difference is the cooperative nature and that it has two lines of cards. One for purchase and one for combating. It also has a boss ala the Cerberus Engine deckbuilding games. I don't really like the semi-coop aspect of: we are all trying to beat the boss, but if I get the most points for different things, I am the ultimate winner. Thankfully, when playing with harder bosses, it's basically a fully cooperative game. One negative I will say about the base game is that all of the artwork for each hero is the same despite cards having different effects. This is really annoying. I hear that it's been fixed in future expansions, but none of the other true expansions (I'm not counting Legendary Villains) have been stand alone. So, even if this was really awesome for me, I would be stuck using these heroes or buying a lot of content for base game components. Neither of those propositions appeal to me. It's a moot point though, because while the actual game doesn't take too long, the setup and takedown of this game is a massive undertaking. I would much rather play Ascension or a Cerberus game if I wanted a similar deckbuilding feel, Pandemic if I wanted a coop, or Aeon's End if I wanted a deckbuilding coop game where you have to beat a boss.

RATING: 7
I played this after Legendary Encounters, and I feel it's much weaker - a shame, as I love the idea of crossing over between all of the different games. It's certainly very easy to start, possibly because it's semi-coop, but I really was hoping for something I could solo myself too. The cards themselves also seem weaker and less interesting, but it's amazing to have e.g. Spiderman fight alongside Ripley. However, the game is not as compatible with LE as it claims, for example 'bystanders' don't have an equivalent in LE, so some powers are useless.

Played twice. A good deckbuilder that's a little unwieldy, physically -- it's a little difficult to setup and tear down, but worth the effort. There's variety in the box, which I like, but some combinations of cards may work better than others. The game suffers a bit from a player identity problem; you're not actually playing as one of the superheroes, although you can get some of that feel if you don't think about the game that much. If you're a Marvel fan, you'll want to check this out.

This game seems big and is one of the few co-ops that can get rid of most of the alpha gamer syndrome.  For me, there seems to be very little connect between the Marvel theme, which I love, and the gameplay.  There are better, tighter deckbuilder games out there.

RATING: 5
+Variable setup and the many different strategies you can create with the same group of heroes creates great replayability
+Love the theme
+Wide variety of synergies both explicit and more subtle

-Rewards for killing villains allow the rich to get richer
-Random draw from hero deck can hinder a player from furthering their strategy partway through the game
-Lucky recruit draws early on create a snowball effect
-I liked the semi coop for a while but am realizing it's really not quite the elegant solution as it seemed. When the popular backlash against the base game was people refusing to play semi-coop and playing fully coop instead, the expansions became more and more difficult, making semi coop not a viable option. The expansions are the only way to add a little more meat to the game but then you have to give up on the semi-coop and still have these awkward cards that reward attacking your team-mates. Really just not elegant design, UpperDeck should have stuck to their guns on semi-coop or really endorsed fully cooperative play. Instead the game is awkwardly in between and I just want to get Dominion instead.
-Also it's terrible that with one big box expansion all the cards will fit in the expansion box but not the base game box, while the board will fit in the base game box but not the expansion box.

(Rating including expansions: [thing=137762]Dark City[/thing], [thing=142020]Fantastic Four[/thing])

One of my favorite deckbuilding games right now (and I don't even care much for superheroes). I really like the variety in this one. Different superheroes, masterminds, villains, henchmen and schemes make each game unique. It's extremely streamlined, but this grants you total freedom during your turn. You have unlimited buys and attacks you can spend your resources on and you can interchangeably use them. Great, great fun! Depending on your playgroup, you can either play it semi-cooperative or fully cooperative.

It does have its negative points though: Setup and teardown take some time and require extensive shuffling to prepare the hero and villan decks. Because of this, I recommend sleeveing the cards, which is something I normally don't do, as they will show wear quickly. And I don't recommend playing with 5 players, because it's pretty tough. Chances are that by the time everyone's had their two starting turns, 3-4 villains have already escaped.

I'm not much of a fan of deck building unless it's part of something else (see Mage Knight, Few Acres, Study in Emerald), but I thought this was OK. The way bad guys move down the track puts pressure on your opportunities, but it's one of those "not really a coop" games though since a) you're really playing non-competitive solitaire and b) there's a high scorer acknowledged. If there were a category for "non-competitive", I'd move it there.

My sister owns this and loves it. I like it quite a bit, too. It is not the most well-thought out game of all time--some of the scenarios and villains are very unbalanced and you do not get to *be* the superheroes--but it is very unique and a lot of fun. I doubt any other game hits the table as much as a result. And if you like Marvel comics, it is a home run! Gets even better when you add the expansions!

An awesome, if imbalanced deckbuilder... but cooperative (unless you play with silly competitive rules, which, in my mind, since you're often playing as one of two clearly distinct binary sides, don't make any sense... but I digress), so I don't often mind the imbalanced aspect of things as I do in the case of the DC Comics deckbuilder, or in the case of Ascension (insert expansions here).

RATING: 5
Really nice idea but not great execution. 

The HQ full of the shuffled together heroes is nice as you cannot guarantee what will be available for your turn, likewise with the villain deck you don't know what is likely to happen on your turn, will the master mind attack ,or advance his scheme, will a villain or henchman turn up, or does a bystander get themselves into trouble. However the masterminds themselves are woefully underpowered and give a player bonuses when attacking them, making them easier to kill that random henchman!
One game lasted less than 10 turns as red skull was easier to beat up than his henchmen!

It is also a little strange that the dividers are blank at the top for you to write in yourself rather than pre-printed like they are in most games.

Sold in 2012.

I can't help but think that if it wasn't for the theme this game would have been buried, only be seen in the bargain bin of your local game shop.  I have played it a few times and have started taking a twisted pleasure from it in how broken it can be - akin to a good B movie.  Subsequent (and numerous) expansions add more of the same, but do help to some extents and providing you have the app to suggest combinations that will work.  Set up and tear down takes longer than playing the game and the mechanics punish you for having a lean, efficient hand.  Also it commits the worst sin in gaming - miss a turn mechanics.  Doing well?  Then you quite often don't get to play as most of your hand gets discarded again.

RATING: 7
Fun, thematic, playable deck-builder.  I dock it a full rating point due to it being too easy as a solo or coop game (most of my plays are solitaire, and even the advanced solo mode is easy to win 90%+ of the time).

It also feels a bit odd having multiple characters, and having certain cards 'KO'ed' from your HQ, but the character is not actually KO'ed.  Just one of his cards.  There's a lot of disconnect between the player and the heroes, especially in multi-player since everyone is playing the same heroes.  I'd prefer a more RPG-like play style, which would also allow for campaign play.

Some of the mechanics are a bit wonky.  Villians escaping the city (with or without captured civilians) is a huge deal in certain scenarios, but often it doesn't really matter at all, even though it is supposedly one of the main things the heros should try to prevent.

A decent game, but not my ultimate Marvel card game by any stretch.

Played 9 times with 1,2,3,5 players for 6+ hours.
Ratings history: 7,8,7,8,7

Play #1, JUL 2013: Honestly, this game was played with 4 experienced players who were just killing time, and they raced through teaching me the game - so I really had no idea what I was doing, or really what was going on at all. I just heard lots of complaints about how badly we were doing.

Play #2 and #3, DEC 2013: Played with 2 and 3 players and...I don't know I just don't enjoy this game all that much. With two players there are 5 hero card-sets and less cycling through, so it's harder to make a good deck. Why would I want to play a game that makes me build build worse decks the fewer players I have. Gameplay a little boring, and I feel like the decks and decisions I make have very little control - a feeling I don't get while playing Dominion. I guess I just prefer the variety and control of Dominion more than the theme and license of Legendary.

Play #4, APR 2014: Found a used copy for a price I could pass up, and played it three players - and loved it. The complaints I had above may be valid for 2 players, but today's 3er was fun. Yes the game is Dominion co-op lite, but great for what it is.

Play #5 and #6: Played my first two solitaire games and found it reasonably fun. I do agree with those people who say that the base game is VERY simple - even simpler than Dominion's core set. Solitaire is when I really notice the (relatively) simple deckbuilding of Legendary.

Plays #7-9: As a solitaire game, this game is too simple and scattered. I had a game where I'd already built a strong red/yellow deck...and then had nothing but green, black, and blue cards available to buy. To the best of my knowledge, you can only cycle heroes when you buy one, or when you KO one as a result of of a Scheme Twist...so a Scheme with few Twists results in no/low turnover. For solitaire play, I'll stick with Lord of the Rings The Card Game.

MAY 2014: It's just too simple, and the SHIELD cards occupy too much game space for too long in the game, which detracts both from fun gameplay and from theme.

A better Ascension.  Because, the cards of Ascension are more complicated and often create enormous links of cards (with 5 players I have seen 3 of the 5 during each of their turns, playing as many as 30+ cards each time) which chokes the game and can make it quite boring.  Because the Ascension cards are more complicated, It takes longer to decide which card to purchase and longer to  play, especially when a player is less familiar with the cards.  The player who wins is often the player who knows the cards best.

Legendary has good strategy, and snappier purchase and attack.  Hard decisions occur when a player has to decide between when & how to help a fellow player, and when to help only himself.  (If the game wins, everyone loses, yet if the players win, one player wins the "mostest".

I would have rated Legendary higher, but the card design is very poor making sorting of the cards very difficult, and therefore unnecessarily extending setup/storing time.  The design problem, especially with the Villains' decks, is that the decks' title is so small & faint and often merges with the background illustration so that the mandatory sorting simply takes too long.  There should either be a more easily read deck title or better yet, a prominent symbol for fast sorting.  I want to play the game, I don't want extensive down time setting it up and putting it away.

It is such a problem, I hesitate to buy the first printing of this game, thinking, hoping, that Upper Deck will fix the problem with a second printing.  Otherwise I really like the game, want to own a revised edition, and am looking forward to expansions.

Others complained that the Hero decks could be more interesting, wishing that each card would have a different pose of that Hero.  That doesn't bother me so much because it doesn't effect play or lengthen the game--it is just a more desirable esthetic.

While I enjoyed the game I played, I didn't experience anything drastically engaging during the game.  There's nothing fundamentally wrong with Legendary.  It's a beautifully presented deck building game with the familiar mechanics for this genre of game.  There's a few things which are different from other games: how the game ends, how to build your deck considering the challenges on the board, and the game can actually beat all the players so they have to cooperate competitively so to speak.  Players who are Comics fans and are looking for a game in this genre won't be disappointed; experienced players who have already played Dominion, Thunderstone, Ascension and etc, won't find anything new apart from the super cool art.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
One of my favorite games. 3-4 players is the sweet spot. With two, it's generally easier to defeat the Mastermind so it's more competitive between the players. With 5, it can be extremely difficult and almost has to be played as a pure co-op. Set-up and packing up are both a giant pain, which is why it's a good idea to play at least twice, so you get more enjoyment for your effort. :)

I have most of the expansions, and there has been some definite "power creep" with the new Masterminds. Not so much with the Heroes: base game characters like Thor and Cyclops still pack a huge punch. I think I'm going to pass on [thing=156689]Villains:[/thing] playing as super-villains just doesn't do much for me.

All plays recorded under the base game. I recommend using a randomizer (app or online) for your card selection. I prefer Legendary Randomiser for Android, but there are plenty of good ones out there. I'm embarking on some solo plays to try everything out and experiement with some more thematic setups (an all-Civil War game, for example).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Strongly prefer 3 players or less. Makes the game feel less solitaire, reduces the downtime between your turns, and you feel like you have a bigger impact since you will usually get a turn before a villain escapes (in a 5 player game, it's more likely the villain might escape before you even have a chance to fight it).

Pros
-Good variability between games (lots of heroes, villains, scenarios, masterminds)
-Can be played solo, coop or semi-coop
-Card abilities replicate hero abilities very well and scenarios are fairly thematic
-Gameplay feels very fluid and combo chains are rewarding
-Simple to teach, relatively short play time
-An easy play, not much thought needs to go into it, most choices are fairly obvious (can be a con depending on group/mood/preference)
-Easy to scale difficulty

Cons
-Hassle to setup and re-sort
-Depending on scenario, some core game effects and mechanics have little to no impact (e.g. villains escaping can either be a loss condition, or have no noticeable effect)
-Semi-coop gameplay breaks theme (why are superheroes competing with each other to take down a villain?)
-Not all team affiliations well supported (e.g. 1/3 game is X-Men, but there is only 1 Spider-Friends character...unless you buy their expansion of course).
-Weird design where certain Masterminds (the ones from the core set, some others) give you benefits for defeating them, but some Masterminds punish you for defeating them (the ones from Dark Cities, some others). Seems very arbitrary.
-Villains (and some hero cards) are generally not very memorable, and the effects usually just feel pasted on (a case of mechanics come before game/theme).

RATING: N/A
I appreciate what this game tries to do, and it has great comic book art, but it just demonstrates why Dominion is the best-in-class.

All the random sources lead not just to high variance, but also fitful starts and stops in game progression; you have extremely limited deck control; dual currency suffers in the expected manner; there's lots of arithmetic; and there are really annoying effects (eg trash the top of your deck, discard and redraw your hand).

The city progression is kind of cool, and the mastermind/scheme/henchman business is also interesting.

Not a fan of semi competitive coop games. Also the art for villains and schemes are the same which really takes a lot from the experience. It's always a bad sign when everyone at the table is talking about playing sentinels of the multiverse after because the current game isn't engaging enough.

I should note that I don't hate this game. But I've never felt the urge to play it and it's a bit cumbersome. While keeping track of the various bits is cumbersome as well in Sentinels of the Multiverse, the existence of that game guarantees that I'd always rather play it than this one.

RATING: 8
This is an amazing deckbuilding game that initially feels a lot like Thunderstone but the cooperative gameplay, superhero theme and the fact that you aren't limited to one action per turn makes this a worthy addition to any collection, even one that already includes TS.

I'd say quality-wise both games are on par with legendary being more in the light fun category, TS in the Heavy strategic. But don't confuse this to mean it is easy it can get pretty rough.

Love the theme.  I like the cooperative aspects and the villain and super-villain attack mechanism. 

Update:  Finding the game a little too easy, my sense is that if the players focus on beating that game and not being the winning hero, the difficulty needs to be ramped up to challenge cooperative players.  Randomness of buying opportunities works against it as a competitive game, but still a fun game played cooperatively.

My favorite implementation of the deck building mechanic. Truly isn't the type of supe game where you should go into it thinking you want to be Hulk. But, as a huge marvel fan, the theme with the actual gameplay makes this a no brainer for me. The scoring method is a neat little addition as well. Can't wait to spend so much money on expansions.

After just one play, I felt there was a lot of set up and little things to know without enough payoff. Just not as fond of this kind of deck builder (similar to cryptozoic deck builder system); I prefer the style that Dominion created (also used by Trains, a personal favorite). I'm sure there's a lot of good here, but I'm not sure I need to own it. Look forward to trying friend's copy again, though.

Deck building review comparing the game to Dominion after one play.
It is an appealing design and intriging theme with alot of variation in set up. Pick a evil mastermind, a scenario and get some of many superhero decks to play with. 

It is semi-cooperative but we played it as a competitive game and the cooperative part which I usually hate in this game I dont mind. 

+ Wounds in deck that can be used by some heros is in theory a fine concept. 
+ Enemies travel on board and you may kill them easier on some spots, that is a nice concept. 
+ Enemies that get away hurt you in some way, a concept that puts some pressure on the players.
- Not that important to kill them off though, and hardly ever any interesting choises of which enemy to kill. 

- Longer game with less improvements in deck. 
- Fewer options than Dominion. 
- Fewer and less interesting synnergies 
- Some turns you cannot do anything. May be only too expansive to buy a card and too hard to kill a bad guy, 
- Bonuses on cards that only take effect if you have already played one card of that type is missleading and annoying. 
- Few options for cards to buy lead to that you only buy the one you can buy. 
- Luck of the draw plays a big part as even if you have managed to get 2 cards of the same type (which will take a long time) you have less than 50% chance to draw both on the same turn. 
- Lots of wounds dealt out if a player use a powerful and unfair Hulk card. There is almost no way to come back from that for other players. 

Conclusion: 
Fun to play a deck builder again, was a long time ago. Better theme and design than Dominion and feels newer more evolved in some ways. But very few interesting choices per time makes it a quite boring game with way too much luck and often only obious and bad choices make me rather want to play dominion even though I am tired of that game....will look for other deck builder with less luck and more choices.

I really like the way the superhero powers can be combined to battle the villains and their minions in this deck building game. How you play your drawn hand of cards can really make a difference. It's not pure cooperative but can be played that way if you wish to not count the victory points of each player. It can be played solo too.

If you like deckbuilding games like Dominion and grew up on Marvel Comics, do not hesitate to buy this game!  People may complain about its easiness, but that's because they are appealing to the casual gamer.  You can always up the difficulty level by increasing the strength of the masterminds.  Looking forward to expansions with new masterminds, villains, heroes, schemes, and different play mechanics.  Quite possibly my game of the year 2012.

I really like this game, the only problem with it is the fact that it's "semi-cooperative." This can lead to hard feelings when someone goes for the individual win while others are more focused on the team victory, since someone going for the former can make the latter less likely.

Update: Really love this game, even though I rarely "win" it as an individual. Upped the rating a point to reflect this.

RATING: 8
Solid deck building game reminiscent of Ascenion. Here's the rundown:

Pros
- Great variety of heroes and abilities
- Fun semi-cooperative player expirence (w/a solo option as well)
- Each playthrough is an unique expirence with customizable scenario
- Pulling off big card combos can be very satisfying
- Every part of the game really captures the greatness of the Marvel universe
- Very straightforward and solid rules

Cons:
- Difficulty is hard to determine for some scenarios
- "Working together," but still competing may not appeal to some gamers

Overall, this game is fun and worth it. With about 10+ playthroughs so far, I definitely see many more games in the near future.

Best Marvel Superhero/villain themed game on the market. Hugely satisfying team play with superheroes and villains running wild in the city.

This game is basically Ascension with certain tweaks. There's a seperate stream of enemies to defeat so that there are always interesting enemies to defeat, unlike Ascensnion. You also choose from several different factions of heroes and villains each game to make each game more unique. All in all it's not that much better than Ascension though, if at all. However, I have not played much. It's around $60 vs around $40 for Ascension. I'd go with Ascension.

At first, Legendary (despite its awesome Marvel theme) was a watered down deck building game to me. It just fell flat on me with lacking variation and combinations, despite having a stronger and more interesting theme than, say, Dominion.

I am not totally convinced this deckbuilder is balanced. A few cards in the right place seem to guarantee wins. However, the coop/competitive element comes off really well, and it always feels close before the push to victory begins. Lots of theming too, and lots of room to expand with new stuff.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Most similar to Ascention in terms of game play but with 2 rows of cards to "buy" - a Villain line of cards that you fight using your combat factors, and a Heroes line of cards that you buy using your influence points. The plus, and point of difference is that the game is playing against you adding tension and more decision points - each reveal from the Villain deck has consequences as well as providing another target for you to beat up on and gain VP's. The main problem is that the game does not progress very well - initially your deck is weak but once your deck gets a few of the non-starter cards, it powers up quickly and the game has little chance of defeating you. Playing co-operatively (to defeat the game) as well as competitively (to score the most VP) at the same time can be a little odd.

The art is very good even if they have skimped a little by repeating the same picture for cards with different effects, although this does actually aid game play and set-up. Some text on cards is also a bit hard to read, particularly card names written in yellow over bright background colours was a poor graphic design choice. The board is excellent and aids play.

And of course, Super Heroes and Villans are always fun. Very good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I wish I liked this one more. I certainly like the theme and the "conveyor belt" of villains is a nice mechanic. You definitely want to catch the villains before they escape, but then again, the penalty isn't too horrible since it gets you to clear a not-so-great hero on the tableau.

I like the artwork, but it is hard to read some of the text that overlays the busy artwork. The icons could be a little bigger as well, since they are important to track and make combos.

Nothing really sets this game apart for me and while the theme is ok, it's not enough to keep me engaged. Also, the set-up time is a little brutal.

RATING: 9
Update: This has continued to play well, into double-digit plays now. The schemes are a little thing that really make each time "feel" different, and require slightly new tactics each time. Not to overstate it, it's not a huge thing, but it does help the theme a lot. The various heroes also play very differently. Overall, a lot of fun space to explore.

The only complaint would be that the difficulty of beating the mastermind is too variable. In something like Pandemic, you will occasionally get a bad shuffle, and the game slaughters you. Here in Legendary, because of the combination of mastermind and scheme, plus the randomness of the villain deck, that sort of thing happens fairly frequently. It's not a bad thing to lose when it's close, but to get wiped out without a chance is no fun.

That, and obviously the tiny text and yellow font on top of busy graphics. It's a terrible design for user experience.

-----
I am in no way a comic book fan, but this is better than Ascension, which is the obvious comparison, because the theme is actually evident and pretty well done. Nice simple take on deck-building, and the villain deck system works very well and feels like the mastermind is building up to something.

One interesting part is that the villains (the point cards) don't go into your deck. So there's no downside to killing small point guys, whereas in other deckbuilders they would clog up your deck. I don't know if it's a good or bad feature, but it's interesting. The benefit of point cards going into your deck has always been that it prevents an early leader from getting too far ahead, because the point cards drag him down.

Mixed feelings.

I think this game is thematic, and the artwork is great.  The cards are tough to read with tiny icons.

There really aren't a lot of decisions to make in this game; most turns (not all), the board presents an obvious choice.  Combine this with the huge setup effort, and you could have a worst case scenario of 30 minutes setup, 90 minute game, and maybe 3-5 significant choices.  Not a good payoff for time spent.  Although I've said the game is thematic, this is not an "experience" game where the theme can outweigh these drawbacks.

Rating is for a 2 player game.  Heck, maybe even solo.

I rate the 4-player game at a 2.  You wait longer between decisions, the game takes longer, and there is zero chance to plan ahead because the board state changes so much.  An hour of dull pain.

Only played once and was rather disappointed that the components hamper play. Art is reused across 15 cards per hero making it impossible to know at a glance what is on the board. To make matters worse the cards have full art and use a terrible font for the title.

The board itself is too colourful. A better choice would be muted board colours (i.e. Ascension) and colourful cards.

As it stands this plays very similarly to Ascension, but unlike that game where I know each card's abilities with a glance at the art, I need to constantly work to read each Legendary card. My wife who has 20/20 vision asked time and again what each card did; she was sick of leaning across the board to read the 6pt card titles.

As game play I withhold judgement until further plays are in.

Great artwork adds a lot, although I wish it would have been possible to give different cards of the same chart be different artwork.  This is a keeper for me.

After playing this four times, I think it's safe to rate it now, but this review will most certainly fluctuate as I accumulate more plays. I like the game, but the setup and breakdown time is an issue, especially for a game where you can lose the scenario in the first 8-10 turns. If I was a bigger Marvel comic book fan, I'd probably rate this higher. If I was able to give this a separate rating depending on the number of players, I'd probably rate it a 6.5 with multiple players and an 8 if playing solo. As a solo game, it's very good, but with multiple players it bogs down a bit. I prefer a quicker experience and in this regard, Dominion beats it as a deck building multi-player experience, at least for me.

I really like this game but find it hard to convince others to let me bring it out. If it's between DC deck builder and Legendary, DC always gets asked for. I like picking the pool of 5 heroes and their various ability cards in it and then going after the different scenarios cooperatively. But it lacks giving you an identity as a character in the game because of this. I guess pretend you're shield agent "A", assemble your team and then fight the mastermind.

Deck builders are my jam, and this one is pretty phenomenal. We wound up playing another session right after the first, and two games only wound up being around an hour in total (including reading the rules and looking up some bits of info that we just needed a refresher on). 

SotM is still my absolute favourite superhero card game, and I was worried that having two would be overkill in my house, but I feel like the two scratch different itches. Delightful and enjoyable itches.

The way the decks are built is an interesting blend of Dominion-style (only some cards are in the game, but you can acquire whichever of those you want) and Ascension-style (all cards are in the game, but a tiny fraction are available at any given time) deckbuilders. But the cards don't seem to DO very much. You scale up to trying to punch real hard, and you get there in time or not.

And it seems to have the Sentinels problem, where some variable setups are just better than others, so adjusting the difficulty level of the game properly requires lots of experience with the game.

Note: This comment is for all of the Legendary: Marvel Deck Building base game, exps, & Villans.

Grown up watching and reading Marvel comics and have always wanted to have a game where you are your favorite Marvel heroes. Found a few video games that did justice to this, but wanted a board/card game. So I was instantly sold when I learned about a deck-building game with Marvel Heroes. 

Rating = 10 due to it being a solid game, replayable, the exp. keeps the different teams in an ever-changing state, and easy to teach people. Will always play this game.

Birthday present for my son after we played at GenCon 2013.  We like this deck building game a lot.
I've changed my thoughts on recording Legendary games. We always play with all of the expansions, so I'm just going to record games under the base game now (Oct 2014).

If you like superheroes, or have kids who do, this is a fun little card game.  Setup/takedown is absolutely horrific, though.  You'll spend much more in setup/takedown than playing.  Especially if you want to play more than one game.  Some balance issues as well.  It's okay solo.  This is really just for Marvel fans; I find it difficult to believe a non-fan would ever pick this over Ascension or Thunderstone as they scratch the same itch in a better manner.

Excellent game.  With all the expansions, the gameplay diversity is incredible.

We love deck building games and this one seemed to have the makings of checking all the boxes, but the semi-cooperative element threw us off.

RATING: 3
Mediocre deck building game. There is virtually no theme. I know lots of people claim this game has theme but they are all unilaterally wrong.

The players work together to defeat the main bad guy by defeating villains as they appear and by purchasing cards for their decks (so they can be more efficient at defeating villains and get higher priced cards for their decks ad nauseum).

This works mechanically but doesn't work thematically. Players do not take on the role of Spiderman, Daredevil or other favorite heroes of the Marvel universe. Players can purchase a Spiderman card for their deck so they can get a "buy" icon and/or a "fight" icon. This allows all players to more or less play Spiderman. And all players are allowed to buy Colossus cards, Electra cards, etc. So players aren't really playing the roles of their favorite superheroes. 

Furthermore, the villains move along a track as they appear. They all start in the sewers. Then they all move to the bank, the roofs, the streets and then the bridge. After that, they "escape". This means there is a constant villain parade from the sewers to the bridge out of town. How stupid! To add insult to stupidity, the SAME villain can be on different locations at the same time! Oh no, Doctor Octopus is on the roofs! But he's also at the bank! And he's on the bridge out of town! I can defeat him on the roofs but he still escapes because he's on the bridge out of town.

Why couldn't they make this game so that each player was one particular Marvel superhero? And you could purchase upgrade cards that would feel thematic to that particular hero? 

And why are the villains on a stupid parade from the sewers of New York to the Brooklyn Bridge?


Did I say, "mediocre deck building game"? I meant "shitty deck building game".

Legendary is [i]yet another[/i] deck-builder (my least favorite mechanic at the time of writing this). I say this because Legendary does little to differentiate itself positively from other deck-builders on the market: its biggest selling point is a unevenly applied coat of superhero paint (if that's your thing).

Above and beyond the usual tedium of deck-building games (which this game achieves in spades by bloating the usual structure with far more text than necessary and difficult to garner iconography), Legendary felt, like a comic book, to already have the outcome decided before the game begins: you know the heroes are going to win. At no point in this "semi-cooperative" game is a player going to tank it for the others (partially by structure, partially thematically) so there's no real leverage to apply to prevent the leader from continuing to lead.

Derivative, drab, dull.

It's what you get if you combine the Penny Arcade Deck building game and Ascension.

There's much more player interaction than in Ascension (thank goodness) and the art is way better. However, like ascension, it sometimes becomes too much a game of "just let a player keep drawing cards for 30 minutes as they play by them self", especially if you use Spiderman.

Overall, very good use of Marvel's IP. The abilities of the villains create some nice tension and interesting effects, and the Heroes that you recruit add a nice amount of flavor.

There is clearly plenty of room for expansion based on the box size, and I look forward to them highly.

A decent co-op deck building game with 3 or 4 players but maybe not so good with 5.  This game usually runs a lot longer than I would like.  The tension does not last throughout the game either.  If things go well then you'll reach a turning point in the mid game where you know the game is won but sometimes it takes forever to finish it out.

One of my favorite deck building games. However, it's very easy to make this game unbalanced. You can't just throw random selections together to make a game. Well no - you can. BUT - some cards don't synergize with others, and you're left with bad combos and it's not fun and you lose quickly. It's best to find out what works best together and play them together to make a scenario. Only downside is you can't just randomly play a game like this.

RATING: 6
I used to play Magic: the Gathering with Devin Low in Milford, CT at a comic shop called "Barrons".  He's a nice guy.

That being said I both love and hate this game.  

My Loves include the fact that it's dripping with theme.  The villain run away mechanic was something I had never encountered in a game up until then and I always thought it was neat. Also, I liked the KO cards for a deck building game, gave the feel that you were wounded in combat. 

Dislikes:  The fact that it's a semico-op game, but that's minor.  I was introduced to deckbuilding games via Ascension so my biggest gripe with this game is that there is no "cultist" card as well as no generic "heavy infantry" style card.  There have been many times when my opening hand would be 4 recruit power and 2 attack power and I get get the feeling that I just can't do anything.  In Ascension poor opening hands felt much less crippling than it did in this game. 

Conclusion:  At first my friends and I loved playing it because we loved the theme.  However, after many plays where people felt like they had nothing to do on their turn b/c the villains were too strong and we had no way of getting the power to defeat them we began to sour on it.  I still think the game is good but there are many games, and even a few deck builders, I'd rather play over it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
Rather easy play, but we've only used the "first play" setup. Need to try once-twice more with harder schemes to see. It's kinda hard to choose heroes at the start, as their combo'ing isn't obvious.
Overall wish there was a little more player interaction (like there is for Legendary Encouters Aliens) and a little more combo'ing. Need to try more characters, though.

Also could do with a player aid, as it was hard rembmering the exact things for setup & the rest.

So far:
OK game, it's pleasant to play (with nice illustrations too!) but doesn't feel like it offers a ton of decisions when you play. The semi-coop aspect is totally not interesting to me & would have better been left out. Feels a bit like a teenager's game.
I'd play it with a smile if offered. I'm not sure I'll spontaneously push it to the table, other than wanting to try new schemes & heroes.

Legendary is a great deckbuilder. Our sleeved box is stuffed to bursting, so I don't know if I'd keep up with new expansions, but the amount of combinations available just with Dark City is great. Never boring, but the setup (and breakdown) time keeps it out of 10 territory.

When I first got this game, I played it a ton, definitely an 8/9. 2 years later, now it never makes it off the shelf, so now a lower ranking.

RATING: 8.5
This is a very solid deck builder. It is boxed like most deck builders (i.e., not like Dominion) which is a shame, so it's hard to get access to the cards during setup.

The quality of the pieces are nice, but the board is larger than it needs to be, and folds in an awkward manner.

More importantly is the game play, which is fun, and varied.

During game play you can sometimes be blocked by having only options to buy powerful heroes you can't afford, which can be a bit of a downer. However, I've only seen this happen in 3 games, and I suspect some experience on which heroes you put in the scenario can help resolve it.

The biggest weakness of the game is it takes awhile to setup, and put away. I don't consider that a big problem.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I didn't expect much going into this game, as I've always viewed comics & supers as vapid drivel soap operas for tween boys, but this game was a very pleasant surprise. It helped that the guy who owns the game is really into comics, and he explained some of the backstories with appropriate gusto. 

This reminds me of a little Dominion, a little Ascension, but the artwork is good, and I don't mind the repeated artwork as some have complained about.

Where the game excels for me is the board layout, and the very thematic moving of the villains, originating in the sewers, and making their way around until they escape at the bridge and the heros receive a wound. Simple but elegant and very flavorful. I also like that while it's a co-op, the testosterone in you can compete for an overall winner.

Pretty good mechanics. Very good board design space. Excellent flavor. We'll see how it wears after repeated plays.

RATING: 7
This is an interesting take on deck-building, dripping with lots of theme from the Marvel comic-book universe, blending together "heros" and "villains" from the worlds of X-Men, Fantastic 4, and others.

Gameplay is relatively simple, starting with 8x recruiting cards/points (essentially money in the Dominion universe) and 4x hero cards which are "fight points". Fight points is sort of another currency that you must accumulate to defeat the various villains that crop up every turn. Each turn starts with a draw hand of six cards, and then the player can either/both recruit new heros (increasing their recruiting power or fight points) or/and fight villains.

The more powerful hero cards come out one at a time at random each turn. Higher cost heros obviously have more capability, either in terms of helping in recruiting or drawing of more cards from the player's draw deck, or helping in terms of fight points. They also have two icons indicating their affiliation and skill group. If on a draw there are cards indicating shared affiliation (such as two cards being part of the Fantastic 4) or shared skill group (such as two cards having the same green strength symbol), the card "powers up" resulting in more recruiting or fighting points.

Villains come out one at a time at random each turn also. They can be defeated if a player can play enough fight points as indicated on the villain's card. Defeated villains are VP, and sometimes come with "bystanders", which are usually more VP. If a player has enough fight points, they can go after a Master villain, for even more VP. However, most times, defeating a villain has consequences, such as spawning more villains, or forcing players to discard or "K.O." hero cards from their decks. The villain cards follow a linear track, marching along a number of spaces, and if not defeated end up in an "Escaped Villain" pile. Unlike Dominion, the villains/VP go into a separate pile, so the play deck is never saturated with useless cards ("Wounds", sort of like curses, being an exception).

As with Dominion, players try to K.O. as many of their base cards, in order to thin the deck. There are various mechanisms that allow a player to do that, but mostly it is involuntary as a result of defeating villains. There are generally two strategies to pursue: 1) build a powerful recruiting deck, or 2) build a powerful fighting deck. The first strategy seems to be the common sense approach, but the game has a time-clock mechanism through the escaped villain pile (if so many villains escape, the game is over with everybody losing), so players are usually forced to start building up fight points.

The game is semi-cooperative, since everyone is trying to prevent as many villains from escaping. However, there are some competitive aspects, as well as collective punitive effects when defeating a powerful villain. The game plays relatively quickly, as card play is intuitive if you're familiar with other deck-building games. The only confusing part may be the various interactions that are listed on the cards, as well as the various upkeep actions that must be performed each turn.

The production values are very good, with outstanding graphics on each card.

Setup is a pain with this design, as it is dependent on the number of players (this can handle up to 5 players, but possibly more with the expansion), and the specific card mix can be somewhat involved based on "schemes" (which is a scenario), which enables high re-playabilty. Takedown is equally a pain, as the various cards need to be sorted back into their specific piles. All in all, it was a mildly pleasant deck-building, but nothing earth-shattering experience in terms of mechanics. I cannot help but think this is a "dumbed down" version of Dominion. Because of the theme, and somewhat simplified gameplay, this seems aimed at the teenager crowd. It's a "7".

Although I've only played two superhero deck-builders, this one is hands-down the better one.

Yes, the set-up can be a bit long. We use dividers from BGG users, and an online randomizer (http://tablemonkey.net/Legendary). This helps significantly.

The base game tells a narrative. You feel like you're a team of heroes coming together, and trying to save innocent bystanders, and stopping a Mastermind who just doesn't know when to quit.

The many expansions, especially Dark City, bump up an already solid game into a superb one.

One of my favourite games, but as many have stated the set up and pack down is tedious. As a Marvel fan this game has a number of my favourite character, but still lacks many of them (as of Jan 2017) like Antman, She Hulk, the Wasp, Psylocke, Dazzler, War Machine, Crystal and many others.

This game is a number of expansions that introduce new aspects, but you do not have to use them. You can also tweak the difficulty. I do wish they would release a set of the base characters with alternative art work. It already exists for Black Widow and the Hulk (I think).

Played twice at the spring Dollar Con 2014. We lost both games; a plus in my book because otherwise I would have felt the game was too easy.

While I didn't feel there was a meaningful decision every turn, there were enough important decision points in the game for me to enjoy the play.

I am not a comic book fan and thus the theme fell a little flat with me.

I cannot count how many times I have played this game. One of my favorite deck builders. Owning all the expansions has risen the game's replayability through the roof.

Works with pretty much every person I introduced it to, and is easy to teach( not Dominion easy, but easy enough for non-gamers to understand) The Marvel theme easily draws people into, like Aliens, because it's something nearly everyone can relate to. Great game, plan to keep it in my collection for a long time.

My rating for this game has dropped considerably over the past year. One of my main gripes, possibly Due to playing it so much (probably over 50 times, haven't logged it on here in a while), is it has become quite easy. Upper deck has really been dropping the ball on Masterminds as of late. Where's Onslaught or Dark Phoenix? How about Masterminds that don't get weaker as you have more of something(like Galactus, Thanos, etc.)? Next is, Upperdeck where is that second print run of the game due? MY board and box are literally falling apart at this point. How about a bigger storage box akin to Smash Up's "Big Geeky Box?" Less "meh" expansions (Secret Wars 1 and 2 are literally 70% garbage)and more thoughts on heroes/abilities/etc.? 

Update: Has my prayer been answered? I asked for Onslaught and Dark Phoenix, and lo and behold they latest expansion(X-Men) will include both as well as having an "epic" side which is even harder!?! What! Not only that but Fantastic Four expansion is being reprinted?!? this is madness. Actually quite ecstatic about both of these coming out. Hoping Upper Deck releases a big box storage solution for Legendary. I literally have no room to fit everything now

One of the best deck building games out there, fun even soloing.

RATING: 2
Love the super hero theme but I hate the fact that the game is semi-coop. The reason is because at times you play so that your team mate can get a card to improve their deck & they end up defeating more villains which gives them more VP. Thus you can penalize for being a team player which does not make sense in a super hero theme world.  Dead of Winter is kinda semi coop with personal objectives but the theme of it makes sense since you have to deal with your morale in a zombie filled world.

This game is Dominion + Fun. I am not a superhero comic fan but there is something at more fun about this game than there is with Dominion. With Dominion people tend to have their heads down concentrating on their own thing, but with Legendary the players are watching and talking about the game during other people's turns.

There are two aspects of the game we repeatedly trip up on. Firstly in our hurry to get started we often get something wrong when building the villain deck (such as forgetting the Master Strikes or Scheme Twists). Secondly we generally have trouble remembering the steps to take when a villain escapes (with or without a bystander). The solution for the first problem is take your time and have someone double check what you are doing.  The second problem could have been avoided if the there was some player aid text next to the Villain Escapes box on the board.

After 10 plays I think it is more an experience game than a game of skill. There are 2 decisions each turn: who to recruit and who to kill. There tends to be more choice about recruitment but the consequences of the decisions are delayed (as is common to deck building games) and for combinations of cards there is a significant chance that they will not happen.  The choice of who to kill has a more direct relation to VP and game end but the choice is often more limited. So strategy may be more an appearance than reality.

People say this is a cooperative game, but it really wasn't when I played it; we didn't cooperate at all, and there was never really any danger of us losing as a team.  I wasn't a huge fan of the system; it was kind of clunky and the symbols didn't seem to work too well because it was too hard to make them work together. The villain was kind of boring too. Meh. (1 play)

RATING: 6
Great thematic game that puts you right in the middle of the Marvel universe. Yet another deck-builder, but a good one.

This game has extreme replayability. Depending on which iconic super villain you fight against, you bring with him different henchmen groups and scheme twists. Players also get to decide which heroes they bring to the game. And since it's Marvel...your options are vast! There's even a friendly competitive nature in Legendary. The player with the most villain points...is considered the best hero. Personally I don't care about these points, just as long as we win!

The theme is what makes this game so enjoyable. So if you're not a Marvel or superhero fan, chances are you're not going to appreciate this one.

RATING: 9
I enjoy deck-builders quite a bit, but this one stands out with the theme and implementation.  I really like the way each villain scheme implements thematically-appropriate rules, and changes the goals of each game a bit.  Set up can certainly be a chore, but Jen and Brennan both enjoy playing.

RATING: 9
Just got it for xmas, played a few games.  I like the co-op play and how it randomizes everything.  But it seems like there should be a competitive side.  We were playing to nice to win the challenge and didn't care how our points added up.  

I think we need to make it a competition to get the most points in the end to make it more brutal.  But we don't want evil winning.

For Solo Play it is amazing!!!  I have been playing every night for a few hours for the last month or so.  I have to say the advance solo play in Dark City is where it is at.  Very challenging if you don't get the right heroes.

RATING: 6
A mediocre deck builder.  Does well at integrating the theme.  Work neat as a semi-coop.  The base setup though is too easy for a strict coop and the game win is set more by the shuffle then the play.  A little better if you tune the victory conditions.

My one and only deck builder is a great game, but the long setup/teardown ensures that it only hits the table when we really want to play it - it's not a game we just pull off the shelf (admittedly this is a problem for deck builders in general and is not specific to this game).  The theme is also pretty great so it goes over well.

I'm not a huge fan of DBGs - they have to have something else going on to make them work for me. Here, the way villains work (and, let's be honest, theme) give me the extra oomph I need.

Solid (semi) co-op deck-builder with a super hero theme. Simpler than it may look at first, while bringing a couple of fresh ideas to the table: the mastermind is a non human AI that fights back and comes with its own deck, plot, strikes, etc; then you have multiple hero-villain confrontation locations, that affect the way certain villains behave, then the bystander capturing system, etc...all neat ideas that put a twist on the standard deck-builder system, without altering its core mechanics. Variable hero & villain deck content helps keeping a good level of replayability, even with just the base game. Overall: fun & easy to play.

RATING: 9.5
I love, love, love this game - simply can't get enough. Probably my most-played title at this point.

Look, I'm not blind. I can see the flaws, and I recognize that this is not, objectively speaking, the tightest or best-designed game out there. Setup and teardown are an annoying chore and a half; the included organizer and dividers are insufficient as soon as you add a single expansion; the art is inconsistent (and some is downright awful); the beginning of a game can leave you feeling frustratingly underpowered; and the theme sometimes breaks down with the mechanics.

But I love Marvel (comics AND film), which adds a lot of geeky enjoyment, and I think the game actually stands on its own.

First of all, you know what characters come in this base set? Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk. Spider-man. Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey. Let's take a moment and praise Upper Deck and Marvel for not packing this full of unknown nobodies and selling the A-list heroes as expansion packs: the base comes with a heaping of the characters you want. Respect.

As far as gameplay, the co-op element works well for a deckbuilder, the slow start makes some thematic sense (gotta put your team together to respond to the villain, right??), and once you chain together a monster hand, you feel like you're in the middle of a page of comic book action.

On top of which, there is MASSIVE replayability and variety right out of the base, and the expansions all slot in pretty well.

I play the heck out of this solo (though not every mastermind/scheme/hero works in solo play).

If you like deckbuilders, it's probably work a look, and if you like Marvel, this is a must buy.

We only played through the beginner setup so maybe this game is better with more difficult villians, but to me there wasn't much of a game here.  On your turn you fight the best villain you have the strength for and recruit the best hero you can.  Then wait to do it again.  Even losing cards from your hand is not really painful because you begin the game with so much junk.  I saw very little room for any sort of strategy other than "get the best cards you can."  Pretty dull.

I did not really enjoy this game until I had my starting cards virtually all removed from my hand on my 4th game attempt. All of the sudden my lame deck had awesome combos.

So, I don't get why so many games have good illustrations and then put them together in a disgustingly clashing fashion that takes into consideration neither readability nor aesthetic. This is one such game.

I didn't really enjoy this game. It wasn't the worst thing, but it felt kinda sloppy, overall, compared to other co-ops I've enjoyed. I felt like the game took pride in its theme and used that to justify the lack of quality in the mechanics and content - "resting on their laurels" or their marvels, I guess.

I wish I could say I enjoyed this.. the idea SEEMED like a winner... however, it fell flat on it's face. Way too long to set up for it being a card game and it took a long time to build up a good set and be able to do anything worthwhile.

I'd like to give it more plays sometime to see if my opinion ever changes but right now.. ehh.. I don't buy into the hype.

This game is an amazingly addictive deck-builder that is fun and easy to play! The one downside to this game is you never stop wanting to buy expansions! There is a ton of content in this game and it's very easy for people who are not traditional Table-Top game players to get into. Personally we don't play with Victory Points and that's the one element of the game that is easy enough to ignore, and makes playing this game much more enjoyable.

Rating simply the base set, its a fun game offering a co-op deck builder.  As someone who is considered intermediate by most, and likely still leaning more towards novice when considered by board game hobbyists, i can say the game is simply to easy.

My girlfriend and I played it for the first time ever and simply put, won easily.  I then played the solo variant of the game and it was hardly a task even with a randomizer.  

I really enjoy the large pool of characters just in the base game, the playing mat/board, the ability to lose in many different ways, the co-op gameplay, the huge amount of expansions and extra content available, and some of the artwork.

My issue with the base game is the ridiculousness of how easy the game is, the price is a bit high for what you get, and some of the artwork. 

Overall i recommend the game and give it a 7.5 because though there is a ton of room to improve, theres also a ton of extra content that allows for much higher difficulty, and new avenues of gameplay.  This game receives one thumbs up.

Legendary is a miserable game, both as a card game and as a deck building experience.  The art design is terrible despite the Marvel pedigree and important information isn't large enough to communicate its purpose when it's sitting in the middle of the table.  Unlike other deck builders, there's very little in the way of cheap actions you can perform each turn IE fighting a cultist in Ascension.  You'll commonly find that you rarely have the money to buy heroes or the necessary fight to defeat villains.  Because it's a cooperative game, there are lose conditions but it's also a competitive game which can lead to players sabotaging the board when they're dead last.  Totally disappointing.

I am a big fan of the Legendary system, but as time has gone on, the base game itself has shown some age.  The difficulty level was not on point and while I do love some of the original heroes (Iron Man and Thor in particular), I do feel that some were either slightly inbalanced (Black Widow) or not particularly fun (Cyclops).

That being said, it is a great game system and I thoroughly enjoy it, especially with the inclusion of Dark City.

While the game is simple, and using the suggested random setup yields crazy balance issues (some hero/scheme/mastermind combos make the game super challenging, while others make it a cake walk), it's a whole lot of fun. The variability alone makes repeated plays exciting. Not perfect, but fun!

While the theme of Legendary isn't a perfect implementation, it's still a fun one that uses familiar characters combined with solid mechanics. The one major dislike I have is that it plays much more slowly than a competitive deckbuilder as players deliberate moves rather than just making them. Still, it's a solid choice for fans of co-op game and deckbuilding games.

When I learned it, it was presented as a cooperative game with a best-winner mechanism.  I don't like "best-winner" games but I gave it a shot.  When it was over, it didn't feel like a cooperative game at all.  It felt like a competitive game with an everybody-loses mechanism.  Maybe it was the scenario we played.  We'll see.  Update: my second session (2 plays) had some of the politics of "help yourself or help the group" come up, which tends to be a drag as far as I'm concerned. Update2: After playing and rating Legendary Encounters, I thought, I usually refuse to play Legendary and I don't really enjoy it, so why do I still have it rated as if I might like it? Fixed.

Interesting deck builder with reasonable use of the license. Minor gripes about visual design (card title legibility mainly) belie a game with plenty of depth and yet relative ease to get into.

Random game setups provide near-infinite replayability but at a cost of very variable difficulty - easy to feel powerless and frustrated, yet also possible to find yourself crushing all before you. Notably thematic setups (X-Men vs Magneto, Avengers vs Loki) tend to be too easy.

As with many co-op games, maximum or minimum numbers of players don't quite work as hoped - generally solo is too easy and 5-player too hard.

This is a great semi-cooperative deck building game where players work as heroes and try to beat a villain and their henchmen which is played by the game.  At the same time, the winner of the game is the one who defetas the most bad guys.

Deck building is one of my favourite mechanics and this is one of my favourites. We usually play the game as a semi-coop because that is what makes it interesting, except when playing with two players. I love the superhero theme and I like creating my own team and going up against a bad guy. My love for the Marvel universe pushes this game up to a 9.

RATING: 6
A very fun game with gorgeous artwork and fun gameplay. There are some problems though.

It doesn't feel very cooperative. It feels more like we're all playing separate games to get the most points at the end.

It also feels really anticlimactic. Eventually the mastermind gets beaten 4ish times and we... add up some points? It just doesn't feel very thematic.

Semi co-op game. Choose a villain, choose a couple of heroes and build a deck from those heroes in an attempt to defeat the villain.

If you defeat the villain the group has succeeded but you tally victory points based off saving civilians, defeating henchmen, and defeating the villain himself.

There's a bit of incentive to actually hinder other players when victory is in sight to guarantee that you get all the glory. The semi co-op nature is kind of off putting at times since it fits into the personality of some heroes but not really all so you can choose to play with that or not.

I love Marvel. I love Deck Building. Should be a no brainer. I would rank this at the bottom of all the ones I've played, Thunderstone, TS advanced, Ascension, Star Trek Deck Building, Resident Evil Deck building. People say there is a theme? Cards with a picture isn't a theme. So I fight the enchantress and she lets me draw cards. That's not a theme. A theme would be if I fight her, and she takes the male hero from my hand with the lowest recruit cost and ads that to her difficulty. That would be thematic because she would have mind controlled the weakest man and makes us fight them too. There is no theme in this game. There is math with pictures of spiderman. The game doesn't have an original mechanic. The conveyer belt is thunderstone. The buy mechanic is every deck building game. And the way the cards interact is simpler then any other game. It's also not a cooperative game. If you play together you will beat the villan. After three turns its trivial to kill any guy on the board, and the villan doesn't really do anything that hurts you at all. I give this game a 2 only because it's not the WORST game I've ever played. Play Sentinels of the Multiverse. That game is far better on every level.

Initital rating: 5.5 (February 2013)

Legendary is a gorgeous and well produced  game, and I really enjoy it´s theme (although I have not read the comics), however I don’t think this will rise more on my ratings as I consider the game has more randomness that I enjoy in a strategic deck building game. The problem for me is that is has different opportunities for each player, one player can get lucky to get a hero card that is vastly more powerful than the others, and the same applies with the monsters, in my game, my opponent defeated all the early monsters and in my turn there weren’t any monster to fight (because the villain card was other than a monster) leaving me no choice but to acquire another hero card or pass. I still managed to win, but I feel that was because I was able to snatch a powerful Spider-man Card. This also happens in other deck building games, the worst of all is Resident Evil, but Thunderstone is also guilty of that. I prefer to play Dominion because it is much more fairer and strategic. Dominion is still king for me.

Another big negative is the setup and packing process, it takes a lot of time to ensure all the decks are properly shuffled.

Bottom line, Legendary is an ok game, but I won’t be buying it because I don’t want the winner of the game to be decided by a lucky draw and I feel this will happen a lot. Still the game can be fun.

After another play, I’m downgrading Legendary rating. I don’t think I’m going to play this ever again as every time I have played, I have been very bored. Perhaps if it comes to iOS and only with 2 players, with more the downtime is excessive. 

Long setup time for what the game offers, VERY LONG play time, but the killer is that you can´t plan (there is no static card offering). You can only respond at the tactics level as there is luck in two levels (the Hero deck and the Villain deck that constantly changes), this is even worse with more players. Fails to grasp what made Dominion great, I miss the limitation Dominion imposes (one buy per turn, one action per turn). The semi CoOp fails as the players know who is winning. In this case the players who are losing won’t help (in most cases) against the Master Mind. In other words if I’m losing why should I help you win?  Legendary is all about fight power, that makes for very obvious decisions. 

In the category of variable card offering deck builders, Ascension is the best game I have played. Much shorter and simpler, I dig the art and it offers the same range of options than Legendary with much less luck and playtime.

Bottom line, very gorgeous and thematic game, but luck runs rampart. I won’t play it ever again. It was a huge disappointment for me.

RATING: 7.5
After trying out Encounters, I fell in love with Legendary system. Thus, another $$$ sinking into brand new game: base and first expansion, Dark City.

Will be playing the mess out of both of them. I am really looking forward to the Galaxy expansion as well!

After first try, the game was a bit too easy. Well, it was just a try out game so I expected the game to be very easy and it was. The superhero theme was definitely very enjoyable. Unlike Encounter, in Marvel, I can definitely feel that I was a superhero rolling over Villains. Whereas in Encounter...oh boy.

The theme alone is what floats this deck builder for me. The Enounter is definitely better game with solid progressing story telling and each player gets special powers (Medic, Gunner and etc).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It has the feel of Thunderstones solo play with villians moving through the city to escape.  The Schemes add some really good variabilty.

The solo game is good for learning the different character but the game struggles to gauge itself from being nearly impossible to beat, to being far to easy depending on what set up is used, also some of the scheme twists are a bit wonky with regard to how they play.  Your deck will get stronger quicker with less players because of your ability to buy up heroes while the villian remains moderately static.

The game really shines when you play with 4 and players will start to feel stretched.  I have yet to win a game with 4 players other than the recommended start game.

RATING: 9.5
Whats this. Recruiting super heroes. Fighting super villians. Bank robberies. Fan cards already. A deck building game with the greatest art work. A sensible approach to super heroes. Bystanders getting in the way so that we can rescue them. This game is crying for more expansions, (and there will be many) that have more:
Heroes
Villians
Schemes
Yes give us more schemes, more everything. This is the first time upper deck has ever recieved my money. If they want more, keep wetting our appetites with more Legendary cards.
You can never have enough hereos. Villians keep popping up and it is our sworn duty to kick their butt. 
This is a deckbuilder that can truly be played solo, like Thunderstone.
Set up is easy. Take down is easy to.
Buy, buy, buy this game. I will be buying ALL future expansions, printing out fan base cards, just enjoying the whole experience. What am I doing typing this, back to Legendary.

I really like this deck building game. Not crazy about the "winner" at the end, but as a cooperative game it's pretty fun. I've only played it twice, the learning game was a little underwhelming. I had trouble building up my deck to have attack power and I felt useless for a few rounds. The second game went much more smoothly and I started to notice that there was interesting gameplay beyond just the cool super hero art.

I really enjoy this game.  I have played both the DC Deckbuilder and this game.  I strongly prefer Legendary (though I do like DC a lot).  I really like the solo play.  This game doesn't scale it's difficulty well to 4 or 5 players, but a 1, 2, and 3 player game is a blast.

RATING: 7
Legendary offers an engaging semi-cooperative deckbuilding experience. Gameplay is fast and engaging, and things develop quickly as you build your engine. The theme is there through some smart design choices (escaped villains, bystanders, hostages, etc), and the artwork is spot on. The only significant downside to the game for me was the narrow decision space. It seems fairly obvious what to do on your turn, so the game tends to have a scripted feel. That being said, Legendary is an enjoyable game that I will generally play when given the chance.

LOVE the theme. Unfortunately, not much else here. Check your hand for combos, play your entire hand, buy either colors you think you can combo with, or just a bunch of cards. Very light on actual decision making.

Also, "co-op" in name only. The game is mostly multiplayer solitaire. Most of the interactions between players are there to promote the "one winner" aspect of the game. Which is super stupid.

RATING: 1
This game is incredibly disappointing. It has good art and a good license but fails to deliver. The gameplay simply isn't smooth enough and will always be remembered as a bad version of Ascension.

The game has flaws on virtually all aspects, whether it be mechanically or physically:

1) Setup: The game takes way too long to setup. This is exacerbated by the fact that you're constructing decks from small piles of cards which means that in order to properly randomize the deck you need to shuffle thoroughly, which increases the length of the setup. If you fail to do this, cards will come out in "clumps" which decreases enjoyment of the game.

2) Card design and pacing: the game pace is completely out of whack. There's no way you can build a proper deck before the end of the game, especially with larger number of players. Furthermore, it's inexplicable why cards do not have intrinsic point value like in Ascension. It removes a viable strategy and focus everything on attack power as the only way to win the game. Everybody's basically doing the same thing: building up purchase then buying attack power and hope to draw all the attack cards at the same time to be able to take down big monsters.

3) Winning condition: The "semi-coop" objective sounds good in theory but just doesn't work in reality. Because the game pacing is screwed up, it's really easy for players to fall behind in the deck building race. Those players then simply have no incentive to keep playing properly and will try to throw the game to make everyone lose. Not fun at all.

After proper reflection, I can safely say that Legendary is one of the worst deckbuilders I've ever played and can't believe such a flawed design made through playtesting. I am convinced it is a broken game and deserves a 1.

This is a semi-cooperative deck building game. Players recruit new heroes or fight the villains. Players fight a villain based only on their deck without help from other players. If they defeat the villain they can also pay to collect a bystander. The villains and bystanders give you victory points. Players can all lose if they don't defeat the boss in time. Note the cooperative interaction seems minimal and it seemed lighter than Dominion. I liked the theme and artwork and enjoyed the game.

What a great game! I played over 10 solo games and now I am convinced that I have no need for Dominion. It is just as deep but has much more theme.

RATING: 8
As a huge comics fan growing up, this game is a dream come true - a superhero themed board game that's actually fun to play. The theming is a bit of a stretch, as technically you're playing a faceless mastermind recruiting a team of heroes to foil the villain, as opposed to playing [i]as[/a] one of the aforementioned heroes... Despite that quirk, you still get the feeling that each hero is unique and thematically suited - Hulk is monstrously strong, but also risks damaging his teammates, Deadpool is wacky, etc. Subsequent expansions add interesting new abilities that, unfortunately, are self-contained to their respective sets. But it's still interesting to see the game continue to evolve with each new iteration.

Highly flawed but fun game with lots of good ideas. It also gets bonus points due to my love of the Marvel universe. Flaws: (A) showing a card to prevent mastermind effects should instead be discard a card to prevent mastermind effects so that there is some interesting player choice, (B) there needs to be some clearing mechanisms for heroes in the HQ that nobody is taking, (C) the players have no control over some of the villain win conditions such as Unleash the Power of the Cosmic Cube, (D) deckbuilding is far too often about taking the best available card instead of strategic deckbuilding, (E) competitive co-op is meh, and (F) the difficulty of the challenges does not scale as the player decks increase in strength so the end-game is quite anti-climactic. Things I like: (1) some of the schemes change game play dramatically such as the Skrulls one or Legacy Virus and (2) a lot of the hero powers and decks feel very thematic in the way they play [although nowhere near as thematic as some of the Sentinels' heroes]

Our first few games involved randomly generated setups which were not interesting and frustrating as we generally couldn't ramp up quickly enough to come close to defeating the mastermind.  Using the Android app to generate random scenarios has resulted in MUCH better games.

RATING: 7
Very preliminary rating of a 6. It's more likely to go up than down, but maybe not too high because I worry that this game isn't as mechanically thought through as it might have been. I do like that it's a lighter, somewhat simpler version of Thunderstone, a game I like very much but that can get bogged down in the mid- and late game with modifieritis. However, the scaling problems that BGG users have aptly identified here, coupled with the fact that, in all likelihood, most of my games of this would be 2-player rather than 3- to 4-player (where the timing and other mechanisms seem to work best) lowers the ceiling and makes the game feel like more of a missed opportunity than a success. The atrocious color/font/background choices, which are indefensible at this stage in CCG/LCG card design, impair aesthetics and legibility both and knock a full point off the rating.

Recommend over Dominion even though Dominion is a better "gamer's" game. Setup is terrible with both for what they are, meaning plan for at least 15 minutes of setup on a 45 minute game.

I played it once, solo. Thought it was enjoyable. (More so than Encounters: Alien) But it also felt incredibly easy.

I really want to like this game. I suspect if I had it, particularly in an electronic version, I'd enjoy it more. But randomly picking everything leads to way, way too much variation. Larger games drag and often feel like whoever get messed up the least. Once in a while nice combos take it.

RATING: 5.5
I've always loved deckbuilding, but I was in this one for the theme. I'm a huge Marvel fan, and I love weird mixes of my favorite characters in general. Because of that, I loved saying "today, Thor, Spiderman, Luke Cage and Mr. Fantastic team up against Magneto". However, that lasts about 3 minutes. The main turn-off I have about the game is that it seems like half the turns are wasted: "Oh, I have 8 fighting, but the only villain needs 9... Next!" Coming up short is incredibly common, something you have NO control over, and very frustrating.

Takes a fair bit of setup, which may be intimidating to some players, but once you're playing it's pretty straightforward. You can download and print some great card dividers to help organize your set, and that makes setup much easier and even fun!

The actual gameplay is a lot of fun, and there are limitless combinations of heroes and villains to choose from. Once you start adding expansions, you'll never play the same combination twice!

My wife isn't a big Marvel fan (she tolerates the movies when I drag her to them) but she really enjoys this game, and frequently suggests playing it. Almost everyone I've introduced this game to has a great time.

I have very little experience with deck building games, but Legendary tickles my (also limited) superhero fancy while being immensely replayable and possessing a remarkable unity of theme and design, as well as some great card interaction and an interesting mix of cooperation and competition. It's good fun, and if I ever pick up a deck building game myself, it'll be the first I look at.

I felt this was a solid deckbuilding game, but it's really suffered from rules bloat over the course of the various expansions.  I feel like every set doesn't need to add new mechanics.  It was already one of hte longer deckbuilding games to setup, but every new card type or mechanic just makes it longer these days.

Also, wish we'd get some first appearances of some characters before getting a fourth wolverine or third spider-man.

I really enjoyed this game. We only played the "first play" villain suggested in the book, but it was lots of fun. We hemorrhaged villains at first, but after a few rounds we were easily able to defeat red skull. I look forward to playing against a tougher villain.

RATING: 9.1
There may not be too much new here...but just enough to keep it feeling different from other deck-builders.
The "co-op" thing is a bit of a stretch, depending on your group's play-style.  Mine tends to be aggressive, hehe...so wounds all around!

I think some of its thematic elements are stretched thin, too.  But, all in all, it's very fun, very re-playable and I am on board for at least another expansion or two.
Well, I have updated my score and thoughts on this game.  I have been playing a lot and there is just a ton to like here.
variety, the theme is better pasted on than I originally thought and we always have a lot of fun when we play.
I've even been play-testing some of the excellent custom made stuff with 2 hands of heroes.
Been a blast!

Really good deckbuilder. Some downsides are bad player count scaling, lots of setup and take down unless you play multiple games in a row with the same deck (I don't) and low difficulty.
If I come across a cheap copy of the Dark City expansion I'll definitely pick it up.

There have been complains about the lack of diversity when it comes to the art but I don't mind that. I like the heros having a uniform look.

Really fun theme, easy to teach and easy to play, this has been a favorite of the family for a while now. The card purchasing is pretty straight forward and the co-op aspect of it is really well done. 

My only gripe about the game, and it is a small one, is this game has had the problem of one person really taking charge and taking over during the game telling others what to do basically taking over their decisions for them.

The mechanics in this deck builder are interesting, but ultimately the semi-cooperative setup of the game forces players to make choices that either hurt the group, or hurt themselves; there has been no sense of team building in any game so far and I do not see how one would be possible with the built-in competition for cards.

A semi-cooperative deck building game. First things first, I don't like semi-cooperative game. However that being said, I still enjoy Legendary. It's most likely because I'm a Marvel fanboy, but the game just takes all of the aspects that I like about Ascension and puts them into a more familiar universe. There are two main things that detract from this game for me. Firstly, I don't like about this game is that the entire game is fixated around buying power, but there is no Heavy Infantry equivalent. Secondly, there is no cultist equivalent for times when all of the monsters are being attacked. You should be able to get save some bystanders for a set amount of power, otherwise your turns are wasted. This ultimately leads to the semi-cooperative aspect going out of the window, and some players willing to devolve the game into a "tank this game" mentality as they're so far behind in scoring. With a lot of house ruling I think I would enjoy this a lot more.

For Legendary, the theme was very well integrated and I never felt like it got in the way. Very enjoyable game with some interesting deck-building elements which allowed for different strategies and lots of options.

The best "semi-cooperative" game I've played so far. Looking out for your own victory points is not so detrimental that it causes everyone to lose, yet all players feel it when someone makes selfish choices. The set up is long and the randomness of the villains/schemes/heroes can make for some games too hard or too easy. It always feels like you're on the verge of losing when you begin and then gets easier as players get their decks built. This is a welcome change from most most co-ops that start easy and become harder.

Fantastic theme and art are marred by mediocre and frustrating game play.  There is potential here but it has not yet been realized.  The mastermind scaling does not work well, as in most cases the strength of the mastermind and villains remain relatively static while the heroes continually get stronger as the game progresses. The solo and 2-player cooperative games are far too easy, and a competitive 2-player game is far too luck-dependent to be satisfying, far more so even than the game that it is most clearly resembles, Ascension. As just one example, the bonus rewards for defeating a mastermind are random and widely variable, with many being nearly useless and many others being hugely beneficial. In many games, the luck of the draw on which mastermind cards you happen to defeat will determine the outcome of the game.  The game probably works best as a 4- or 5-player cooperative game, but even this would be better if the villains power scaled up over the course of the game.  On the plus side, the hero decks are generally well-designed and make thematic sense, and the scheme twist mechanism is brilliant and offers the potential for huge variability of game play without adding a single card to the game.  Moreover, the scheme twist mechanism can be easily manipulated to provide villain power scaling over the course of the game.  Unfortunately, only a few of the schemes provided in the box do this at all well.  Nevertheless, future expansions could easily address this problem, as could user-generated schemes.

Deck building bastante original, es una buena idea venderlo con un tablero para colocar las cartas.

The idea is not bad, it's just I think it does not play well. First, the setup process is horrible because cards needs to be shuffled. Which creates another problem that you must read the cards every time they come out. At least in Rune Age and Dominion, you have to read a dozen of cards, and when you know them it's done. Another problem is that destroyed card go to the KO zone which makes storing the game even longer because you need to sort back all the cards that was used though the game

Second, the card play is very confusing. In fact, you do not play cards, you simply reveal you hand and apply all the effects, because all cards can be used for all action. For example, if a card give you points to recruit and attack, you can use it to do both. But sometimes cards get amplified by other played cards, so it becomes a bit confusing to keep track.

In the game I played, I managed not being able to attack anybody for the first 6 or 8 turn. That made the game very long and boring for me. I think starting with 12 cards (draw 6) is way too much. I liked more Rune Age for this where you start with only 8 (draw 5), so that you have chance to draw the card you bought on the next turn. Here in legendary, you must wait around 2-3 turn before getting the cards you bought.

Finally, there objective of the game are a bit boring, and there were little threat going on. It happened more than once than the master villain was actually easier to defeat than the regular villains. What kind of master villain is that.

So that game did not surprise me at all.

It is Marvel Hereos the Deck-Building game.  It's has great artwork, which overshadows the card font/size and card text.  I think more functionality and a little bit less artwork would have been nice but that's very minor once you get accustomed to the cards.  The colors or symbols are very useful reference points.

The excellent game system has similarities with Ascension, and Thunderstone as well, both games I enjoy.  I need to see more expansion decks and replayability but I think this is a fun, thematic deck-builder that totally fits my superhero taste buds!  I tend to enjoy the more challenging scenarios that forces players to semi-cooperate or lose.  The only knock on this is the preparation and cleanup is a pain (even moreso than other popular deckbuilders).

I like deck builders and I like Ascension, but I'm one of the few nerds with no interest at all in super heroes, so I'd not played this before. But I was curious about the Legendary system, so sure.

This just didn't do a whole lot for me, and let me sum it up by telling you the final scores of this game: 54-7-4. That's me with the 4. Losing isn't a problem, and the 54 guy was a noob as well. It's just...that's not a lot of fun, watching one guy be able to clear the board but when it gets to your turn everything is too expensive. Ascension can have that issue as well, but I guess I can live with it there because I'm interested in the theme (or at least, not uninterested). 

I imagine this was something of an anomaly, but even so it didn't have me hankering for more.

Legendary: Marvel was the first cooperative deck building game I bought. I loved the Marvel theme and I like deck builders (see Dominion / Dale of Merchants).

However, the game is a bit on rails and there's very little interesting choice.

There really is no 'puzzle' here. It's all about building a team of heroes that allow you to do insane combos of cards and ultimately beat the mastermind.

It's a fun time passer.

I will say, don't play at any more than 3, otherwise the game drags.

For a better deckbuilder - See Xenoshyft.

Most thing about this our pretty great and thematic.

What I don't like is how you're mixing a bunch of different heroes into your deck.  This doesn't make great use of the herobuilding mechanic.  It makes some use of it because there are maybe 2-3 different types of decks you can run.  And there are a couple of combos.  But for me to really love the heck out of this game, it would have to use the deckbuilding to greater effect with how the cards interact with each other and the choices and versatility to the decks. 

Also, the luck is very strong with this one.  I like random setup but in this game the way everything is random makes the game sometimes really easy, sometimes really hard.  Certain heroes are much better against certain villains, certain villains are flat-out better than others, certain villain groups are better, certain schemes are harder, certain henchmen groups are harder.  And then there's the luck of which heroes you have paired with each other.  Then there's the luck of the draw and the the luck of which heroes are available in the trade row AND the luck of which villain cards get played when.  I've never seen such a pile of randomness in my life.

Variability - high
Replayability - medium
Strategic depth - low/medium
Thematic - medium
Art - awesome
Strategy vs luck - low
Down-time - bad
Also you have to constantly, incessantly, shuffle.

I still enjoy this game quite a bit.  Just love playing these cards.  Funny how you can still enjoy a game that has major flaws.

RATING: 6
This game does not work well as a co-op, as not only is the game very easy, but unless a villain has an escape effect or has captured a bystander there is basically no incentive to killing them. If played competitively, killing monsters earn VPs and there seems to be more tactics in hate-buying the card your opponents wanted, but then I don't feel this game lends itself to that very well thematically. 5 players makes the card availability too chaotic and unless you negotiate allowing people to get cards they want to complete their combos your deck will become a smattering of random cards.

EDIT: All in all, Legendary's main draw is that it has schemes that change up the game significantly, but it suffers from the aforementioned discord between mechanics for semi co-op (especially since a lot of the stuff that prevent the scheme from happening don't give you a lot of VPs) and cooperative play, the lack of thematic reasoning for the icons boosting your other cards, a bloating of too many key words in the expansions while still not making each character feel wholly unique, and a horrible rich get richer due to killing stuff not bogging down your deck and a lot of fight effects benefiting you. I'm making it sound like I don't enjoy the game but I do, it just could have been so much better.

user Logopolys had the following to say:

"I didn't like Ascension for deck building, but Legendary works despite being the same game mechanically. However, Legendary's synergies occur in multitude, as you would want from a card game like this. Hero skills and team affiliations trigger combos, and heroes (unsurprisingly) combo fantastically with themselves, making it very easy to build functional decks. Legendary also hits it out of the park for diversity: the sheer number of heroes, masterminds, villains, henchmen, and evil schemes that can be mixed together in absurd variety make for fairly fresh gameplay each time. Finally, the comic book theme shines through: the characters are incredibly clear, to the point that sometimes I'm buying heroes just because I like them, rather than if they work well in what I'm building. Good game."

This is very nearly my opinion exactly.   I've played many deckbuilders by now, of various types and pedigree.   ultimately deckbuilding works best as a part of a larger game, and pure deckbuilders are limited by being a "deckbuilder".    Still, there's a lot of fun to be had in this one, which is why it stays and around and I keep expanding it.   

Legendary "Encounters" games are technically better games.   they have more depth to their 'schemes' and more cooperation.  but the crazy combinations are why I play deckbuilders, and Marvel Legendary blows all the "encounters" games out of the water.   I have played Encounters - Firefly, Predator, Alien.   

There is a thematic disconnect to buying different cards from a hero...yup.   but that is easily overlooked with all the different combos and using powers to fight bad guys.   

Most deckbuilders have an issue where there isn't enough variety in the base set, and they really require 1 or 2 expansions to really take off.   Marvel Legendary has this, with the base set having a decent set of characters, limited villains and relying too much on the semi-coop aspect.   Later expansions make the villains much harder and bring in some fun abilities.    This is disappointing, as I have a hard time recommending base legendary to anyone, as I think it needs at least Dark City to be a decent game.     

Also the art in the base game is limited, with the same image on each of a hero's card.   at this point I don't think there will ever be a 2nd edition with new art, but it sticks out when you use the base heroes.   

Saying that, Legendary has done a good job of avoiding power creep, with base heroes still plenty powerful enough to be used right along side new heroes.

I hadn't played this until recently, but I got addicted pretty quickly. I love the diversity of cards, and the limited pool of heros to hire is pretty great. I also really enjoy the combinations of villains and schemes that you can create. This is my favorite superhero board game by far.

UPDATE: I prefer the Encounters set at this point.

Best with: 1-4

Duration: 30-60 minutes
Notes:
card-based game with plenty of effects written on cards in hand
also good number of cards on the table to understand and read
plays best after a few dry runs as players understand the cards and how they interact so they can draft properly
mostly cooperative, but with an overall winner based on points achieved

I think Dominion is all right, but not this.  Little tension, difficult [i]not[/i] to beat the mastermind, clunky deck-building mechanics with superheroes pasted on.  Co-operative or not, make up your mind?  I dislike the "yay, we all won! but you won with more points than the rest of us" idea.  The card design isn't particularly well thought-out, the only redeeming factor is the decent comic book style art.  I question whether Upper-Deck should be publishing/marketing hobby boardgames.  Aren't baseball cards more up their alley?

Yeah, I am not a fan.  Two plays is enough for me after it left me feeling uninterested and unimpressed.

One of my family's favorite deck builders.  Played by 8 year olds to adults in our home.  A solid deck builder with good comic theme.

Another deckbuilder type game. This one presents several different scenarios and you can tailor your deck to particular styles based on the hero cards you pick up. Some have complained that there isn't much variety in the art. I do think it would be better if it used different art for cards that do different things so you can tell at a glance what you have especially since the text can be a little difficult to read at times. If I'm going to play a Superhero game I guess I'd rather play one that puts you in the role of a superhero rather than a collection of cards representing the stuff several superheros can do.

Really good deck builder... each hero feels very different and trying to get the right synergies with the certain heroes is a lot of fun. On the flip side this game says it's cooperative with one "Legendary" player at the end (based on victory points), I found this to make the game much more competitive than cooperative. Maybe if we upped the difficulty that would help, but the game can be in your face and other players can hurt what you do based on their actions. This is not a bad thing but can be misleading if you are looking a good cooperative experience.

My new favorite.  I've played Dominion and Ascension and enjoyed both but they grew stale for me after a while.  This one is definitely the king of them all imo right now.  A theme I love, plenty of different scenarios which change the game and keep things interesting, plenty of heroes to choose from, a functional box with an awesome insert tray, divider cards, and foam insert, a gorgeous board, well written rulebook.  I mean, shall I go on?  Buy this already.  If you're a comic book fan or a deck builder fan or both than you'll love this.

GORGEOUS artwork

Great theme (Marvel! Can't go wrong. Superheroes!!)

A deckbuilder AND cooperative TOO!!

BUT as a deckbuilder it doesn't seem to rival Dominion. The demo that Dice Tower did just didn't excite (although the review was overwhelmingly positive).

Seems to have all the correct elements to be a winner of game.

Bit of a mongrel. It's competitive but it's also co-op. Don't think I'll ever be a fan of that schism.

RATING: 9
Simply put, this game is FUN. Ignore the VP counting at the end and treat it as a pure co-op unless you really need 1 winner.  The mechanics in this game work very well, and the set up makes each game unique.  If it starts to get a little stale, add one of the many expansions which will drastically increase unique combinations of scheme, masterminds and heroes.  Must Have.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.8
One of my favorite games. I find the points to be fairly unthematic so we always play full co-op like Whose Line is it Anyway 'where the points don't matter'. I love finding heroes that combo well together in new ways or against a particular mastermind and scheme, or trying a thematic set-up or an all-girls set up just to see what happens in my own Marvel universe. 

Set up and tear down can be a bit of a pain but practice and good organization cut down on that. Also, when you think you've shuffled the villain and hero decks enough... shuffle them some more. Trust me.

This game doesn't know whether it wants to be a co-op game or a competitive game.  Depending on your group it can work as either.  However I (and many others) feel that it doesn't work as either.

Very fun deck-building game. I've never been a huge comic book fan, but I am I a big DBG fan. Plays like a combination of Ascension of and Thunderstone.

The Theme of a game is the first thing that gets me to play / buy a game the second is mechanics and how it plays - this hits both square on the head. A super hero co-op deck building game which comes with a choice of 15 heros and lots of villians and plots. Only gripe is the plots in this set are fairly easy to complete - manual does suggest variants to make it harder and dark city expansion is a must if you like this game. huge thumbs up for this.
This still beats alien n predator by a whisker due to the fact you can create your hero's deck by picking 5 hero's form a huge choice. I've also started writing my own Schemes which isn't as easy on the other 2 games.

Nice fusion of mechanics and theme.  It has lots of variety and replayability.  It has stronger theme and story elements than the DC Deckbuilding Game.  Expansions add a lot to the game without making them "must-buys".  The drawbacks: set-up/teardown takes a few minutes, 3-player game is the sweet spot, & rules can be a bit daunting to new players.  I recommend this to gamers who love Marvel and the deck-building mechanic.

Played many times with many set-ups and expansions.  Ok, this game is really fun for what it is... but keep in mind what it is!  It's an american-style, very swingy, lucky, super hero-themed game.  You can't go into it wanting a balanced, elegant strategy game.  The winner will rarely be determined by a long-term strategy and sound decisions.  There is a lot of randomness and the timing on the card draws will very likely determine a winner - and can do so very early in the game.  So just go into it with the idea that you're having fun "playing with a toy"... not "playing a game".  Having said that, if you can "roll with the punches" and laugh at your horrible misfortune, and not get too cocky with your undeserved wins it's a lot of fun.  Tons of fun Marvel characters to play with too!

An ok game, well made, but the base game is a disppointment playing solo... The best way to play it solo is the good old two/three/four/five hands multi-personnality way. And this way, it shines as a solid and epic dekcbuilder.

Got it, loved it, fell out of love, then back in love again. My first "deckbuilder", and being a Marvel Comics fan it was a no-brainer.

Simple rules, and though I'm not convinced there's much "strategy" to the gameplay (especially since we randomize all the hero decks in our games) it's a ton of fun with 3 players, with the fun diminishing the fewer players there are. Solo it's just too much of a machine and it loses the spark it has with multiple players.

RATING: 5
I didn't think this would be for me, and it wasn't. I played a version with all expansions mixed in.

I liked the artwork on the no-core cards (core art is fine, but repeats across different cards are annoying) and the clever card names. The mechanics are interesting in places -- I dig the villain progression, and the overall variety of possible combinations in a given game is staggering -- but just dull or decent elsewhere. There's nothing here that makes me want to play Legendary over Ascension.

In two games, I had a lot of dead turns, gameplay was often so tactical that there was no point in picking up my hand until my turn rolled around, and I didn't get to contribute much to the group's success. The first game was "nothing, nothing, nothing, hey someone got a great turn and beat the mastermind." The second was nothing, engine starting, mastermind wipes hand, nothing, good hand, mastermind wipes it, repeat as needed." Sure, we won, but the ride wasn't interesting.

I like the idea of a co-op deckbuilder, and a Marvel one to boot, but I don't much like this one. I wish Legendary was for me, and I get why others like it. I didn't have a bad time playing, but that was mostly down to playing it with friends and the fun artwork.

RATING: 8
After about 15 plays split between 4 and 5 player, I rate this a 9.  It is a light game like dominion, but has plenty of real decisions to keep it interesting.  The art, theme, and mechanics all work well together to create a game that we keep wanting to play.  I suspect that Dominion will see greatly reduced play for quite a few months, maybe onwards.  Already looking forward to an expansion or two.  More masterminds, villains, henchmen, and especially schemes would be nice.

And so, in the first three days we got in 29 plays with 2, 3, 4, and 5 players.  The game is a keeper for us.

Game scales in number of players and difficulty with ease.  Easy to follow rules too.

Difficulty discussion is odd - does anybody read the rulebook?  There is a page on altering the difficulty.  Try Loki at 15 with 11 twists and the legacy virus, with a random set of heroes.  If you get lucky you might win. Too easy? Um, no.

After many months, I have over 300 plays of this game.  One of the best games of 2012 (with A:NetRunner and Clash of Cultures)

Now in 2016, it has not had the staying power of Netrunner or Clash. So, I moved the rating down to an 8. In our experience works great with 2, passable with 3, and not with 4 or 5

RATING: 7.03
Legendary Encounters beats this is a rather one sided fashion. I don't mind hard games. I understand co-ops are by nature hard as well. 

My issue is the lack of control I feel in playing the game. I even played it with a friend being the mastermind. I had 9 turns where I used four of them to heal, another four to only buy sidekicks if that, and one to actually have what I would consider a normal turn. My friend who played the mastermind said he felt like he really didn't have to really do anything, and we lost easily. There's difficult and there is you simply aren't winning and there is nothing on your part you can do. Ugh.

Yes, Encounters is built on the same system and can have its own swings, but Encounters engages me in a way where this one doesn't.

How much investment does the game offer? 1. The mish mashing of characters in this really does take away from the theme for me.

How consistent is it in its plays? 1 This might be kind.

How well does it handle its various player counts? 2. Seems fairly solid so far although I haven't looked at numbers. I think you need the first expansion to make it difficult anyway across multiple player counts. 

Fun? 1. A couple of games have really felt like I was doing little outside of being beaten down with no real ability on my part to change that. 

Quality game mechanics? 1.5. Will get converted to a 2, but I can't give it an honest two since again, Encounters beats this.

Overall a 7 for design. 0 for my need to own it. I'll put need to play at 3, so 7.03 overall.

The base game is fun, but I found that it gets old pretty quickly. Additionally I found many of the schemes to be on the easy side. Also, it is confusing having the same art on all the hero cards of the same hero. Differing art on the different cards within each hero would make the small text on the cards not as much of a bother. This game is definitely in my top ten though when adding the expansions. There is so much fun to be had in the added content. If you buy this game, you have to at least get the first expansion. It adds so much game to this.

Been playing this alot (2 player) lately;  as soon as we finish a game, my son wants to set up another one.  Plays quick and easy and fun and I like the theme, so I haven't been minding at all.

Update:  my son still loves to play this one, he likes the new mechanics in the secret wars heroes.  I don't mind playing it, but don't like it as much as him.  I would never play this with more than 3; too much downtime for not enough game.

Obviously my number of plays is not kept up to date, probably have played this one at least 50 times.

Okay game. Thematically strange. Heroes working together, yet competitively. As co-op, it's too easy to beat. As competitive play, it does not involve much strategic decision making. After cycling through the heroes and the mastermind, there isn't much left to explore. Good for the first 10 games. Now it's just a broken game I have no interest to play again.

BTW, Black Widow is OP. Black Widow + Dreadpool = IMBA. I can beat Loki + Legacy Virus 100% of the time with just a few cards from Black Widow and Dreadpool, keeping my deck to less than 15 cards. 

You cannot do the same with any other heroes.. Wolverine? No. Hulk? No. Any of the Avergers combo? No. Xmen? No. Spiderman? No.

Great theme for the kids but I like dominion more. After a few play you will want to get expansion (similar to dominion) as you don't want to see the same hero again and again. The default mastermind is too weak, strongly suggest to try out the stronger mastermind create by fans (search the files section) 
Setup and Clean up takes some time.

Great concept, the intense objectives and the insane amount of replayability are the game's greatest qualities.

As it can be expected from this type of game, there's not much player interaction at all. Also, every player sharing the same ''hero pool'', instead of each having a different hero is a huge missed opportunity.

Currently my all around favorite deckbuilder, mostly for its versatility and replayability.

Good: 
This is a licensed super hero game which has art for many familiar Marvel heroes. 

Bad: 
I am not a huge fan of the deck building mechanics in this one, it feels really odd to have several copies of the same heroes spread through all of the players decks. Plus the villain deck is, well, random and doesn't require as much tactics or cooperative planning as games like Sentinels of the Multiverse. 

Additionally, the setup and put away time for this game is way too long. All of which just kills the motivation to try and play this one.

RATING: 7
My biggest problem with this game is that there don't seem to be any important decisions. You only have one or two choices based on the cards in your hand, and you just do whatever you can with the points that you have. Variability is the best part of this game.

Loaded with Marvel flavor, and I like how the schemes integrate with the Matermind to play out like a comic episode. However, my group and I struggle (like many others do) with "who am I playing"? I know that we are playing as SHIELD agents (or story moderators), but it is sometimes a difficult role to accept - NOT being one particular hero (or heroes... which would be AWESOME if heroes decks were selected, combined, and played like in Smash-up).

[COLOR=#FF3300]Looking at the shell - massive variety, but at the core - few paths to take on. You get a great deal of stuff happening on the board each time, but the strategy is almost always the same, you either go for draw power or straight up attack combos. I still think highly of it because a) I love Marvel universe and b) Scheme Twists somehow manage to patch up point b), because most of the time you are *forced* to make an adjustment to your deck.[/COLOR]

Really enjoy the game. Thought it was too easy until we used this houserule:

If a number of villains escape equal to the strength of the mastermind-the number of players, the mastermind wins.

All plays from 36 on include Dark City

All plays from 48 on include Fantastic Four as well

Deck builders typically exist in a strange, ethereal game universe where theme is legally required to be [i]nearly [/i]as thick as the air swirling about your head and most of your time is spent shuffling things.

If Legendary were about toilet inspectors or Renaissance merchants or mixing paint, it would be dull, dull, dull like Dominion or merely meh like Thunderstone and Shadowrift. Instead, it's a mildly interesting blender of competitive and cooperative with pretty pictures of superheroes.

It's not ingenious. None of the deck builders is, though some make that claim. But it is decent enough given the constraints of the genre.

The fact that you're mixing and matching various superhero powers--anybody can put Hulk or Storm or Wolverine or Spider-Man card in his deck--doesn't make a lot of sense. And the powers seem fairly random, with limited connection to the superhero, with the exception of the Hulk.

It does have Spider-Man, though his power seems to be somewhat limited. I expect that was a necessary balancing mechanism to keep his awesomeness from overpowering the other heroes and making them seem irrelevant. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2
The quintessential game in my favorite game genre.  This is the best deck-builder that I've yet to play.  It's co-op (but there's still a winner)...you aren't just building a deck for points, you have to build firepower to beat enemies to gain the points, and there's a solo-variant.  This is probably my favorite game, but the Marvel theme probably helps separate it from my other favorites.

I like this next evolution of deck building games. The cards combo well together in ways that make a lot of sense. The theme isn't as weak as most deck building games I've played. That said, the art is too sexist for my wife and that severely restricts its options for hitting the table.

My family is not competitive, so the idea of teaming up against the board makes this our most played game to date. Massively repayable, great theme, and all around fun. I still come home from work and see my wife has played a couple of solo games with it.

Update: The sheen of this has worn off some and I feel like I like other deck builders better. Star Realms and Dominion are ones that I would suggest before this. The theme and coop element are enough that it gets requested and played more than it would other wise though.

03-Nov-2016:  Just want to make a brief addition to mention that I only play solo using the [thread=1200976]Golden Solo Ruleset[/thread] now.  You use the 2-player setup with a couple of simple tweaks, so you get to use five heroes instead of three.  It just [i]feels[/i] like a more natural way to play alone, and it's more fun using more heroes, IMO.  There are a few odd rules combos that arise on occasion, but nothing that can't be house-ruled on the fly as to what makes sense.  Definitely recommended.

02-Jul-2015:  Legendary: Marvel is another contender in the ever-popular deckbuilding genre of boardgames.  Obviously, this is themed within the Marvel universe.  You play a group of superheroes fighting off a mastermind and his minions.

It takes some cues from the Ascension engine with two forms of "currency" and the ever changing market of hero cards to purchase.  However, it adds quite a bit of fun to the mix with a conveyor belt of enemy cards wreaking havoc on the city.  A Mastermind is in charge and must be defeated before the endgame is triggered.

Especially with Dark City expansion (but even with one or two of the smaller ones), variety is one of the main draws of this game.  There is seemingly an endless combination of heroes, masterminds, villains, and schemes.  Using just the base game, the difficulty is fairly low, but the advanced rules and plethora of options listed in the Dark City box make this game a challenge as well as full of fun.

I don't feel like any specific superhero while playing, but I think the overall theme of being a group of superheroes fighting a group of baddies definitely shines through.

Overall, the game is a blast to play, and that's why I really love this game.  I know there are other games in this series, but since I began with the Marvel version, that's probably the one I'll stick with.  If another theme tickles your fancy, then I say go for it.

I really love the theme and the variety of cards available allow for some challenging scenarios. It really shines with the expansions which bring new ideas into the game and exponential variety. Everyone needs to defeat the villains but then can score individually at the end making it semi-cooperative.

You start off with a hand of 12 S.H.I.E.L.D. Agents, 4 with attack of 1 and 8 with recruit of 1. On your turn you basically do three things: 1 pull a villain card and follow it's text, then you play your own cards and can attack and/or recruit heroes. Of course the heroes you recruit power up your deck and provide the combos you need to defeat the villains and eventually the Mastermind.

I suppose some gamers won't love it. The cards you draw and order you play them make a difference but those decisions aren't particularly difficult. For me though it's a really fun exercise which I've enjoyed experiencing with my young son.

And I'd need to be convinced that it even makes sense for this game to be a co-op(ish). A very strange experience, somewhat resembling playing a game.

RATING: 10
One of my favorite games of all time, even started playing before I knew about BGG (the play count should be much much higher). This game and Catan are what brought me into board gaming. Definitely in my top 10 and my favorite coop game. Yes its a standard deck builder with the same skeleton as ascension but the theme and risk of every turn is always a huge payoff, when it doesn't cripple you completely. I keep this game current and I sleeve the entire game. I even have two playmats now, one custom and one from tournament play. I'm always looking out for the next expansion too. The only 
"expansions" I'm missing are the villains base game and expansion. I owned them but they weren't my cup of tea. And a word on components, the card quality is exceptional i just wish there was a better storage system. C'mon wheres my big box!!

Definitely not for me. The game is very cleverly designed to allow a variety of scenarios that customize each game in a way I've not seen in any deckbuilder before. The scenarios really push the theme into a narrative success.

However, the gameplay is rather dull. The decisions are all tactical and quite obvious, perhaps even more obvious than Thunderstone, which is saying a lot, since a player can attack and buy on the same turn. That coupled with the fact that cards can be used for their textual action as well as attack/buying power means players never have to decide between cards or uses.

Setup and teardown are as bad as its reputation claims. The semi-cooperative mechanic is always a loser in my book. Just not a good game.

How many deck-builders does one need to play? Evidently one more, if Legendary is any indication. I had all but written off the mechanic as unable to sustain an entire game, much less a genre, before I played this one. Yeah, it's completely in my wheelhouse (comic book fanatic since childhood, and a Marvel zombie for sure) but there's so much to like here- great variety, fun interactions that improve with the expansions, and a real understanding and clear communication of the source material. I even like the semi-co-op scoring, though I can see why it irks some. The super hero game to beat, and a top five desert island 9 and rising.

Does "deck-building" well with plenty of variability between the heros, villains, scenarios, etc., but also introduces the "competitive-cooperative" element, which I thought lended a nice amount of tension and interesting decisions to it. Definitely a must for Marvel fans.

Played twice now, once with kids, once with an adult. Kids liked the theme, but we got pounded due to some bad draws from the villain deck. Takes a LOOONG time to setup and take down, lots of card choice, selection and shuffling seem to contribute to this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
SOLO CAPABLE

45 Min. (longish setup)


The artwork is delightful. It would be neat if each hero had different art for their different abilities, but it's by no means a deal breaker. What I really have a problem with, is that the villain cards have text used for sorting the cards that is too small and obscured by the artwork, which makes putting the game away take probably twice as long as it should. Although it's not a deal-breaker, it's such a lame design choice it's bewildering. It will make you angry. That said, the game is fun.

Because the scenarios can swing greatly in difficulty depending on the villains and heroes used, I feel it necessary to document my plays, detailing the setups to try different tactics on sessions I lose or to tweak scenarios I find too easy. It's extra work to have to log the setup stats, but this is also the kind of game where session notes are kind of fun, and actually prove that, unlike some of the game's detractors, the theme of the game does shine through. 

An example of a note from my first solo victory:

"Good won the final showdown with 45 points. Spiderman's ability to save bystanders and Black Widow's ability to use those bystanders to add to her attack strength was a powerful combo. The Midtown Bank Robbery scheme also added many extra bystanders (bank customers) which I was able to save, thereby slowing down new villains from entering the city."

Regarding solo play:
I've played once with the official "advanced" solo variant and once with Skyzero's solo variant version 3.0. The official variant was easier to play and less fiddly, but I kept feeling like I had limited buy options, which was rarely the case in the SkyZero's variant where you play with four hero decks and put a new hero card into the HQ at the beginning of every round.

RATING: 9
There are many aspects to this game, some I very much like, others not so much. First of, I'd like to say that despite anything cons I may list, I still really enjoy this game and have given it 9 stars!

The Cons
- So, as many have found out, this game can be exceptionally easy, depending on what Mastermind, Villain groups and Heroes you choose. Depending on how you play your cards and which Heroes you decide to recruit, the Mastermind can be defeated (practically) within the first few turns, which, needless to say, can be frustrating.

- There aren't many ways (if any) in which you can stop other players from winning, other than defeating more Villains than them. Although you work together to defeat the Mastermind, in the end you count up your points to see who the final winner is, but you cannot stop the players from defeating Villains or Mastermind and there are also no methods in which the Villains that the other players may want to defeat become harder. So, if another player wishes to (and can) defeat the Mastermind or a Villain, there is nothing you can do but sit and watch them defeat said Villain.

- I have 2 separate expansions for this game and I have found they add a lot to the game. The reason this is a con is because the game is made SOO much better by the expansions and the base game does not have any of these aspects which make the game what it is without them.

The Pros
+ I have to say, the biggest pro for me is the variety! With the amount of Masterminds, Villain groups, Schemes and Heroes, you will almost never play the same game twice (unless you want to, of course) and this definitely helped me like this game even more, as you can never get bored because every game it changes! 

+ Another pro for me is the artwork! It is made in a comic book style and given these are comic book characters it really made the game seem much more...real? I'm not sure the correct word but it definitely helped the game look better!

+ This pro is the one which made the most difference with the amount of stars I have given it and that is that I really enjoy, if not love, deck-builders, so that really made the game much better for me, personally.

+ Another pro which made a huge difference is that I really enjoy Marvel! I love the thought of superheroes and defeating the bad guys!! So that is what kinda made me want to play it in the first place, the it has to be a big plus in the amount that I enjoyed the game. 

Overall, this game, for me, was a 9/10 Stars!!!!!!!!! I will continue to play this game many times in the future, probably because a) I like thinking that I am totally a superhero and b) the variety means I will never play the same game again! (or I might if I fail it and then really want to complete it and continue playing until I win!)

It's a pity there's no revised edition. Love the game but w/o expansions it's not as fun as Villains one. I'd love to see a version with multiple graphic design and a playmatt instead of board like on newer Legendary core sets. With Dark City this game is great tho, srsly one of my favs.

Theme absolutely shines, moves at a nice pace, overall length is just right (not too short or long), accommodates a decent amount of players including single player, difficulty ranges from normal to extreme depending on layout.

An excellent deck-building game using a great selection of characters from the Marvel universe.

And finally, it works brilliantly as a solo experience too.

I love legendary almost as much as I love Sentinels of the Multiverse.  Marvels deckbuilding game that keeps players ontheir toes with various scenarios.  If you grow bored of the goals in the vanilla box,  grab an expansion, there are quite a few out there!  

I love the flavor each hero deck brings to the table, including Maria Hill at command center ready to find you new recruits.  We always play with the side kicks (from an expansion) which does change up the game little, we well as bonus bystanders/victims who actually do something!  

The play board is stunning visually and keeps everything in its place although we're still trying to figure out how to keep the cards still when packed away......any ideas without purchasing a new insert, msg me!

OK. So where have I been the past few years that I am just now playing this game? 
This is a ton of fun to play.
I enjoy the cooperative deck building this game offers. 
It is a little complex at first to get going and there are plenty of rules to learn. At first, we were beating the game without any problem until we watched youtube vids and realized we had been doing some stuff wrong. 
We did have a few questions on some cards and had to go online to get some clarification. But once we got those we were off and running and having a blast.

It does take some time (10 minutes maybe) to set up but totally worth it.
Great artwork.
The board itself is large so you do need some space to play.
I also suggest getting protective sleeves for the cards because you shuffle them a lot and they could wear down.
I like that there are expansions to add too.
If you like the Marvel Universe then you will want this game. If you like cooperative gameplay you will like this game. If you like deck building you will like the game. If you like games you will like this game.

One of my favorite deck builders to date. The difficulty is very inconsistent, and continues to be more so with each added expansion, but the game is always fun. If you have any interest in superheroes at all, this is one worth checking out.

UPDATE: Increasing rating to a 9. This game has only gotten better with more expansions. Initially I probably would have given this a 7 or an 8, but the content available for Legendary has really helped elevate it for me. I think I'm one of the few people out there who miss the more mild enemies from the base game though. Playing against harder masterminds is fun from time to time, but I like this game best with a more casual and semi-cooperative feel.

I don't know why I couldn't gel with this at all - I love Marvel super heroes (or think I do) but it felt like a laggy deck builder that brought nothing new to the table and was easily outstripped by other thematic DB titles like Resident Evil Deck Building Game. Downtime was awful, you don't care about other players turns as they don't really affect yours, and yet, they managed to make a couple of tweaks to the system and deliver Legendary Encounters: An Alien Deck Building Game which somehow seems light-years ahead mechanically and thematically despite being basically the same system (and with worse art!). Much prefer the DC Comics Deck-Building Game for its simplicity, shorter play time, Crisis mode, and, well, Batman.

Fantastic game that can pull in people who would normally not play board game because of the Marvel aspect of it. It has a lot of replay ability because of the different "schemes" which are the conditions for the villain.

However the game overall is a must have for avid Gamers and those trying to get others interested as well.

Pretty fun game, but a lot of it doesn't make sense from a thematic standpoint. It also takes too long to set up and put away for what it is. I honestly don't think I would give it a second look if it didn't have the Marvel theme. It's not even really co-op. I just think Thunderstone does everything better than this game.

Update : More plays and the expansions have elevated this game for me. Thunderstone is still a better game but after initial setup it is much faster to play a couple of rounds of Legendary

Semi co-operative game, you need to beat the mastermind and his schemes. Liked how the villains moved along in stages and escaped. Novel mastermind and scheme setup for each game, so lots of replay value. Not very difficult, but went way too long for a deck builder (~90mins?). Would never play competitively, would be a terrible experience robbing cards other people need to make a somewhat functional deck, while hurting your own deck in the process.

I don't even own this game, but I play with my friend's copy every chance I get. I definitely think the expansions help give the base game some much needed depth, though I didn't care for the Villain expansion and feel the power creep is advancing quite rapidly. Setup and teardown are also quite lengthy, but overall I have a lot of fun playing.

A vanilla deck builder with very easy mechanics. There is nothing remotely new here or different or exciting. Better than Dominion, though, as it is not entirely a multi-player solitaire. It is also only a semi- co-op so I would have no trouble playing it again. Theme worked okay for me although I have no clue about the Marvel universe.

Our first deck building game. Seems very solid and entertaining. Bought Dark city and deadpool to go along with the original purchase of GotG. 
This game has turned me around on Marvel. Used to be DC elitist, but this game made me realise I don't mind a lot of marvel stuff. The comics are weak, but the whole universe they have established is pretty fun.

RATING: 9
This is a very fun deck-building game with a great license.

Finally, I get a superhero board game that I can play with others and it's enjoyed by all.

Much more simpler and faster than Thunderstone, this game will most likely fully replace Thunderstone even though it's brand new and the expansions haven't rolled out yet.

I have played it with 2, 3 and 4 players and a sundry of scenarios and it has been fun even when we've all lost (damn you reckless Hulk).  

My girlfriend likes it very much, even though she hated Thunderstone.  That says something!

I don't mind the repetitive art, though obviously it would have been cooler otherwise (but more expensive) and I don't mind some of the abstract gameplay stuff, because it makes the game play smoother and still gives you the thematic flavor.

You do feel like you are a team of superheroes trying to foil the masterminds' plans.

I like to play with all Masterminds, fighting them in order of their fight value.  So the first one is Red Skull, then after beaten we switch to Magneto, then Dr. Doom then Loki.  More variety, more fun!

Go ahead and buy it and salivate at the expansions' possibilities!

Update:  
This game continues to be fun, and because it is very quick and satisfying, it has fully replaced Thunderstone and threatens any newcomers to the deckbuilding world.  Not Fantastiqa or Puzzle Strike though, because they work the mechanics in a different way.\

Update 2:
Got burned out after making variant characters and villains and all that.  To enjoy it nowadays, I have to disregard the comics part of it, because it is definitely not a simulation of Marvel comics. Basically, I have to contain myself from wanting to put every existing comic character into the game, because that would be far too time-consuming and it would never feel "right".

So, I'm still waiting for the perfect (or close to it) comics-based game, that's not a spreadsheet-needed Sentinels of the Universe.

For a casual deckbuilding game, Legendary is pretty damn fun though.

Update 3: The release of Villains renewed my interest and desire to play it.

Update 4:  With the collection of Dice Masters and the Steam port of Sentinels, and the burn-out from making custom cards and knowing that some of them are more fun than the official ones yet they do not look like the official ones (because I won't spend that much money printing them the deluxe way), I frankly don't know where I stand with Legendary.  I equally feel attracted and repulsed by it in a month-to-month basis, reason for which I haven't bought the new expansions.  I'm also not keen on co-operative games or even semi-coop, because I want a clear winner in games and not one that simply won because of the game system's manipulations.  I don't know, and it hurts.  Hope you all enjoy it better than me.

Update 5:  I'm back to liking it a lot.  I think it's an annual thing where I rediscover what I enjoy of it, then think about it and play it too much that it burns me out, until enough time passes that it feels fresh again.  It's complicated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Having said all this, I still like the theme and I'll still play it occasionally when I want to play something that doesn't require a lot of thinking. It just could have been so much more...
And honestly... Wouldn't have bought it if I had played it before I bought it.

But... my wife bought Legendary: Dark City which makes the game quite a bit more challenging. Also, I have tried the game solo a couple of times.
With this expansion or playing it solo, I'd give it an extra star, and am happier to own it.

RATING: 10
What pushes this game from 8-9 range into 10 is the speed and flow of what still feels like a *fairly* meaty deckbuilder with lots of variability. While better with 3+, the wife and I have so much fun playing it 2 player that I have to regard it highly.

RATING: 5
Rating might be a bit harsh. This is a fine deck-building game, and lots of fun if you have affinity for the Marvel universe and are willing to invest in some expansions. The wide variety of plot cards is probably the strongest part of the game, as it creates a lot of variety in specific goals you are trying to accomplish (or avoid).

I have two problems with the game: 
(1) The "semi co-op" rules as written are pretty bad - better to play as a full co-op instead.
(2) I have a disconnect between the strong superhero theme and lack of any identity when playing the game. Why are we all collecting the same cards that showcase different superhero actions/moves? Who or what am I representing in the game? This doesn't matter from a mechanical standpoint, it's only the theme that suffers.

I'd be happy to play Legendary: Marvel if someone else is keen to suggest it, but probably wouldn't suggest it myself.

For a thematic deck builder, I prefer Thunderstone. That game system has it's own set of problems, including the generic theme, but feels more engrossing to me because I have a better sense of who I am.

RATING: 5
Legendary's core gameplay is essentially the same as almost any deckbuilding game, with minor variation each game created by whatever combination of card groups are chosen to be included. The Scheme deck though is a brilliant innovation that allows for radical variation in setup, card emphasis, and endgame conditions.

ANOTHER deck-building game?!?!  BUT, THIS ONE has Marvel characters?!?!  Well, it must be AWESOME than!

I liked this game fine.  I wish there was more art, and I wish there wasn't a million other deck-builders, but this one is cool enough just for the IP it is set in.  Yes, that's right, I am a Marvel fan-boy, but I still do not think I will ever own this game.

A pretty decent and fun deck-builder.  I am not sure if it set itself apart from the pack enough with the whole co-op, but NOT co-op thing, and I will probably never own it, but I wouldn't turn down a game.

This game takes the DC Deckbuilding game and kicks its butt. The theme is here, at least much more than in that game, and it is a fun game after after a few plays.

I am completely burned out on DBG's, but for some reason, I can't wait to get this game to the table again. The theme works very well and the system is different enough that I had a lot of fun with it. I also like feeling like we're working as a team while playing to defeat the big bad.

RATING: 7
Like a hybrid of Dominion and Ascension, and better than both but only by the slightest of margins.  And much like Dominion and Ascension, the expansions help a great deal.

The thing is... it's pretty easy to win as a co-op, and it's billed as a co-op.  So is it a really easy co-op, or is it supposed to be competitive?  Because if it IS competitive, it becomes Cutthroat Caverns, and that really goes against the whole "team of superheroes" thing.  Soooo.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this game, but find the set-up and take down deter me from pulling it out more often.

I also get a little bored with the repetitiveness of the hero abilities.  I play mostly solo, so having only a small number of heroes means seeing the same powers over and over and over.  

I do like the variety that comes from different themes and villains, though and the easy rules make it pleasant to play when I do pull it out, but I really have to be in the mood to go through all the set up for what I get out of it.

Recent replay of the game resulted in additional issues: primarily that potential for the entire HQ to be filled with cards that cost 6-8. The result, no one can buy cards for multiple turns resulting in escaping villains and game loss. This happened two games in a row. We had to make a house rule that if there isn't at least one card in the HG that is 4 or less, the entire HQ gets scrapped and new cards are put out. Very frustrating.

Thoroughly enjoyed the Marvel Universe and role playing the heroes in their own comic book scene.  Setup is a little difficult: Each hero is the same image,  and all the different categories can be a little daunting.  Have to get your box set up to where you know where everything is, and can access them.  Every game is different, and the heroes really play off each other.

RATING: 9
The Marvel Legendary system is my most played game. As about anyone will tell you, the base set needs help because it's not overly challenging. The X-Men expansion comes with a nice number of challenge cards to spice up any game, or you can find plenty of suggestions online if you really want to just stick with the base set. But if you're set on a one-and-done deck building game with no additional purchases, it's probably best to look elsewhere.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.8
The Legendary system is very similar to Ascension and Star Realms - that is, a light deck builder where you start with a basic deck and gradually add better and more powerful cards as you play the game.

Legendary adds a narrative/story as you play and players compete against the game itself in order to win before the failure conditions happen.  The basic idea from game to game is the same: build a deck with cards that will combo well together and produce enough attack power in a single turn in order to defeat the Mastermind.  There are a lot of different scenarios that alter the basic formula.

The game plays great solitaire, or in small groups (down time and chaos prevent me from enjoying it with greater numbers).   You can play straight co-op, solitaire or competitive.  Solitaire works really well, because you have more control over what cards to purchase and it isn't a boring 'beat your last score', but there is an actual scenario you are trying to defeat.  If you have an expansion, you can play semi-co-op with one player as a mastermind trying to beat the others.

The basic game is fairly light and without the expansions I would not enjoy it all that much.  The interactions between the cards is just too basic.  I've said the same about Dominion though, so I don't see this as a huge negative - it seems pretty typical in the hobby to have a boring but accessible base game.  Thus, I have invested in a lot of the expansion content in order to add depth, difficulty and variety.

I would play more, but the set-up is a pain.  Lots of different decks to pull together and shuffle.  So, to save time, I've just made a few different games/scenarios ahead of time and they are ready to go for play.  This gets it to the table way more often.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The competitive cooperative idea is stupid and ruins a lot of parts of the game. It also comes down to almost an exclusively 2-3 player game otherwise it gets too watered down and lengthy. Also what is with that set up time?

Kind of a knock off of Ascension though with an interesting thing tossed on.  Some good ideas though execution of alot of the game feels sloppy and the price point is way to high for a DBG when so much out there is available for a good $20 or less cheaper.  Balance overall is kinda wonky but at least the theme makes up for such things.  The games coop and competitive combo of a system also feels at odds with itself at times.  Be interesting to see if future heroes can really be fresh and unique as just the base set heroes alone feel often lacking in flavor with slapped on abilities.

[b]Marvel Legendary[/b] was sold via auction 8/2/14.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (4):[/COLOR]

[i]This was another game we got early on and as such received a lot of plays. Since that time we have come to realize that we just don't care for most deck building games. It is just a mechanic I do not enjoy.

Love the theme, but I found the game play unsatisfying especially when yo would save up to by a rare superhero and then be lucky to actually get to play that card once. I found that in almost all of our plays that most of the game you were playing with mostly commons and a few uncommon cards from the superhero decks. Also set up and tear down is a bear. I did really like the different scenarios that you played each game, that added a good amount of replay to the game. 

In the end it is an okay game that I do not need to own nor play again.[/i]

I was obsessed with this game a year ago, always playing it as a quick filler from Euro to Euro. I still play this fun deck-builder from time to time, just not with the same intensity. What works really well in this game are the hero's powers and how they are integrated into their specific deck (Deadpool's powers are wild and have no logic to them, Daredevil's powers rely on player's intuition on "blind" draws from their deck, etc.). The game is semi-cooperative and very hard in some scenarios but it's always fun swapping out different Masterminds, Villains' Schemes, and Heroes. A bit difficult to set up quickly, but worth the time.

An Ascension clone, which is not a bad thing as Ascension is fun, but this adds a bunch of bits which are arguably non-improvements. Much longer and fiddlier to setup and pack away (which is one of Ascension's strengths). It splits out the middle row into an acquisition row to enhance your deck (heroes) and a fight row to earn victory points (monsters). After that it's pretty much identical. Draw your cards, acquire as many heroes as you can, kill as many monsters as you can. Get powers that feed off each other. The whole semi co-op thing never works but at least you can from the outset choose whether to play for your team score or straight up competitively for most VPs. Its one advantage is that, similar to Sentinels of the Multiverse, you choose which villain set and which hero set to play with (hence the long setup) which at least provides some inter-game variety that Ascension lacks and allows fans of the theme to flesh the game out in their minds and ham it up a bit. Other than that, it adds little to the deckbuilding genre that we haven't already seen.

Probably the best deck-builder of it's type that I've ever played. Also is a co-op. It a Super-Hero themed Thunderstone where the gametime is quicker, players deck-build Ascension-style, the villain deck reveals a card once per turn, and victory point cards don't go back into players' decks. Combos happen more than any other deck-builder of this caliber that I've ever played. Good feel to this one. Tons of replayability. Can play Solo.

Don't worry Thunderstone: you're still my favorite! But Legendary is very cool! But I must Jones Theory it out of the house. I hope someone makes a cool App of this.

Some negatives:
- Included Box Dividers for cards have no headings.
- No randomizers come with the game.
- Some of the graphic fonts are difficult to read.

RATING: 8
"Having played more than 40 times (many solo), I accept the argument that it doesn't work perfectly as a pure co-op...BUT I have really enjoyed it, as a pure co-op, as a 'mostly-co-op', and especially solo. The setup can make it simple or almost impossible to win. The VR solo variant is much better than the official solo rules."

What I like:
- Seems to be playable pure co-op (just adjust the difficulty)
- Fewer things to track than Sentinels of the Multiverse
- Each hero is quite different, and mostly thematic
- Solo seems to work well, especially with the "Variant Review's" variant

What I don't like:
- As with other deck management co-ops: not much player interaction
- As with other deck management games: some random setups may be problematic
- Somewhat lengthy setup and tear-down (5-10 minutes each)
- I'm not generally a fan of semi-cooperative games (co-op but with one "winner")

The comic superhero theme is neither a plus nor minus for me. Comic fans seem to really enjoy the theme.

The villains ramp up quickly, whereas the heroes takes some time to build strength. At least with 4+ players, that leads to a very unusual game flow for co-ops, where the early game is stressful, and then things (hopefully) calm down later. 

Play is pretty straightforward, although there are a lot of cards and effects. I would put the weight more like 2.5 rather than the BGG-voted 2.3.

RATING: 8
A deck construction game built around the Marvel universe.  You draft hero cards that help you recruit or fight as you try to defeat the Mastermind before whatever Scheme they've hatched runs to fruition.  If the game suffers from anything, it's that the theme can be a stretch for some.  It's almost as if each individual player represents the same possible team of heroes in alternate universes because it's not like one player is the X-Men while another is the Avengers and still another is the Marvel Knights.

But that shouldn't get in the way of a good game for the overwhelming majority of people.  Constructing your deck to provide the right synergies between different heroes and teams can be very interesting, leading to some truly "super" turns when you've done the right recruiting and the stars of the randomizing gods line up correctly.

Fun game that can be a bit fiddly to set up if you don't get things organized well.  Used the dividers provided to sort things by name & type, then use a random number generator and a reference sheet to determine heroes, villains, mastermind, etc.  Once the game is organized, things can go pretty quickly, though you'll likely want to get 2-3 plays in every time you break it out for the setup & breakdown time.

The card stock is flimsy and not very good.  The graphic design for the backs of the cards are completely identical, making it difficult to separate cards.  At the very least the backs of the hero cards and villain cards ought to be different.  The dividers should also have some way of distinguishing between the different sets of cards.

Setting the game up for the first time, or between games, and after game, takes a fare amount of effort to put the decks together and take them apart.

Fell in love with this game again after 2 years of it sitting on my shelf.

The best deck builder I have played with TONS of replayability.  Great theme, well executed mechanics.

The ONLY negative is the breakdown time.

Fast paced and tense.  Will be playing this game ALOT.

Eh. I'm mostly a solo gamer due to my social retardation, so the semi co-op nature was a bit of a thorn in my boxers. Thanks to Sky Zero's solo variant, this is gonna stay in my collection. I've got some issues with the thematic choices they made. Why are there two Juggernauts on the playing field? There can only be one Jugs! Do you not know who he is, bitch? I also wish that you got to actually BE a Marvel hero instead of just drafting them. I'd have much preferred a Marvel game more along the lines of SotM, which is a much superior comic book game. Whatever, though. I'll still rock this every so often.

A rather solid deckbuilder. I don't really care that much about comics, but the game was very well done. I have too many other similar games (felt like ascension and thunderstone mashed up), but if I didn't own either of those, this would be the one to get.

Update: After playing it a couple more times, I've come to this conclusion. I don't care for the comic theme, the semi co-op felt like lazy game design and the setup/takedown takes too long. Other than that, the deckbuilding, enemies, scenarios are interesting, but it just doesn't do it for me. I'll resist playing the game and I didn't really enjoy it. Not the worst game I've played by any means, but I'd much rather play something else.

I can't say I was struck by this. It lacks the cooperative spirit of a superteam game (such as Sentinels of the Multiverse) and I found myself dealing with periods of downtime. The narrative is simply not strong enough. The DC deck builder is simpler, shorter, faster, better.

Pretty decent as far as deckbuilders go. There are some issues regarding setup that prevent a random setup (which I will always prefer) but you can set up heroes and villains based on your favorite comic sagas, so that's not a deal breaker. The semi-coop nature of the game is a little weird, but it works alright.

Better than I thought it would be. No overlap other than theme with Sentinels. A little meatier than Sentinels it would seem. 

It feels and plays a lot like co-operative Thunderstone. There is quite a bit of overlap. Because of this I'm going to wait for an expansion or two before deciding to buy. I did have fun with the game though.

RATING: 8
The only thing I hate about this is set up time:  you have to pull out the cards for the various decks and make sure they are shuffled really well, and if you play more than one game in a sitting, you have to organize everything before you set up the next.  Can be VERY time consuming.  It's easy enough to have it preset up to be the first game of the night when your group arrives, but like I said, go make a sandwich or watch some tv while the second game is set up.

We needed a deckbuilding game that had both great gameplay and that mixed well with a theme and Legendary did it IMHO. Dominion is still way more strategic since the cards are already open on the table and is a better gamedesign.

It didn't got a highter rating because spiderman cards are poor (should have been writen with "cost 3 or less" in its ability. And artwork could really be better and diversified,
Come on! Marvel had such amazing artists they could do it ten times better.

Explained the basics of Dominion (grandfather deck builder) to the girlfriend the other day and her comment "What? You just buy cards to buy more cards?  There's no attacking or anything?  That doesn't sound fun."  Legendary is fun and if you are Marvel fan it might be a must buy.

I finally got to play this deck builder at my local meetup and I enjoyed it quite a bit. We lost horribly and I want to play again. This game feels like a mix between Ascension and Dominion where the layout and the resource is closer to Ascension and the mechanic of deck building is from Dominion. Wound sucks just like Curses, lol.

Played with 3. Our consensus: nothing especially wrong with it but pretty lackluster--not a great deckbuilder and not a great supers simulation. It's unusual for this group to be straight up bored with a game, but on this occasion, we were. Perhaps we'd played too many other games before it the same day.

RATING: 8
This game reminded me a lot of Ascension. It's also a deckbuilding game with 2 'currencies', one for fighting, one for recruiting. However in Ascension those currencies are sort of equel, as cards you recruit or also worth some points. In Legendary you wanna concentrate on good fighting cards as defeating villains or the mastermind is the only way to score points.

I think that the replayability of Legendary is greater then that of Ascension, as your deck of heroes, villains and the mastermind is different every time. But the consequence is that set-up and clean-up of Legendary will take longer as you have to create each deck at the start of your game and sort out all the cards at the end of the game.

Good thing is that there are really a lot of cards in the core set, so that you can create a lot of different sets. 

Just as with Ascension turns are quick, so playing time is short enough. The extra 'semi-co-operative aspect (like in CO2) is a nice additional feature.

Loved the first couple games, then I started wondering if there was enough challenge in it. Fortunately the last several games have been nailbiters with wins and losses. Looking forward to the first expansion.

[Update] The first expansion really takes this game where it needed to go. With the expansion games are much more difficult to win and makes playing fully co-op an exciting way to play.

[Update] Even with the expansion, Sentinels of the Multiverse has really pushed this to the side (but not replaced it) as the go-to superhero game.

Just another deck building game, in the style of Dominion. If you really like the Marvel universe and co-operative deck building games, this might be a good game for you.

I like this better than Ascension for the theme (including art), co-op mode, and variety but for me I still think there isn't as much strategy as I'd like.

Sentinels of the Multiverse feels more like you are playing a superhero - this game is more like you are commanding multiple superheroes, kinda, sorta, maybe.

Too much set-up, but you COULD just have some hero and villain decks setup and ready to go.

The cards are terrible quality and in my opinion must be sleeved adding considerably to the cost.

Great for Marvel fans though.

RATING: 6
Better than Dominion. There are actually some strategies to develop and the choices aren't always obvious. Very easy to learn (mechanics are straightforward). After the second play I thought the game was simply too easy. What makes this game work is that the players must work together to make certain the 'bad guys' don't win but when the game is over each player scores the victory points earned during the game so there is a single winner. Some of the cards will alter the victory points earned which can alter a player's decisions during the game. 

This is not a deep game but it is fun and certainly better than Dominion.

Note: as I do not follow comic books, I played the game by the numbers and the powers on the cards. I was not even certain who some of the characters were on the cards.

This game is not bad.  But it's not good either.  I guess if you are into the Marvel franchise it may be more interesting that it was for me.  Here's the most evident characteristics of it:
    The mechanic of the game is trivial, and it mostly a game of luck, with little tactical depth (let alone strategical).  The most annoying part being that on must either play the whole of the hand or discard it.
    The graphics are - very surprisingly for a Marvel product - below par, to the point that is easy to make mistakes while sorting the cards (that belong to some 30 different groups).
    Best characteristic: very high replayability, given the high number of combinations one can have.
    Probably an excellent game for a teenager who is not into board games, avoid if you are into the hobby and are not a Marvel fan.

RATING: 3
OK, so maybe a couple of games isn't enough for some, but I feel it was enough for me. A passable deckbuilder, but one in which the obvious choice is usually the only one: I never felt like I played well or badly, just that the game played itself and I participated. Extremely susceptible to an early good hand putting a player into an unassailable lead (try 43-12-8-7-3!).

This is a deckbuilding game where there are several ways all players can lose against the scenario. You hire heroes to battle the badguys who run along this conveyer-belt of cards trying to escape. Players earn points for beating them, and end the game when the big boss is out of his life cards.

A big part of why I like this game is the theme. I like Marvel comics, although I have to say the costume choices they used for this are far from my favorite era.

Absolutely love this game, the expansions are fantastic but difficult to store as there is no storage system.
The cards are really thematic and in tune with the individual superheroes.

Some of the schemes are more interesting than others but with so many, that's inevitable.

Combining certain schemes and masterminds can create really devastating effects which make the game so rewarding when you win.

This really is a must have for Marvel fans as the whole universe is pretty much captured amongst the expansions.

It would be nice to see the original masterminds get a power boost but there is always the option to play alternate rules to alter the difficulty in the rule book.

Incredibly enjoyable for a quick solo romp. 
But, pretty important to start with a 'good' set up. Some combinations of heroes can stomp all over some villains and masterminds, and some just don't stand a chance.

RATING: 6
An ok game, but not great. It depends heavily on its theme, but the theme falls apart for me because it's unclear what I, the player, am in the game. I'm not a hero because I'm buying lots of different hero cards. I'm not a SHIELD agent because I'm buying other agents. It feels odd and prevents immersion in the theme.
More importantly, it feels like most of whether you will win or lose is decided in the setup and shuffling. You make lots of choices in the game, but none of them feel very meaningful. Every time I've lost the game, I can't answer the question "What could I have done differently in order to win?". The answer seems to be "Nothing, that's just how it came out". It feels a bit like the card game War in that respect.

Kind of a Dominionish deck building with coop elements. Each person cycles through a deck which has 2 main purposes - purchase a hero character from a common pool or fight an evil character that also cycles through 5 locations. Beating the evil characters give you victory points - if the henchmen can cycle off the board there is a negative impact on players.
The hero cards can work in combinations to strengthen effects or give you more draws.
The villain cards also have effects - some positive but mostly negative on your hand. There are a few cards that allows you to mess with the other players. The net is while you are building your hand the negative effects force you to dump cards so the deck building is not just a incremental progression.

The cards emphasizes form of function. There is a lot of dramatic art. However there are couple of tiny little symbols in the corners that are used for special effects. The net effect is the cards are cluttered.

An interesting game, there are several different combinations of events, henchmen and heroes (again ala Dominion) to provide variety. Better than Dominion? - in some respects yes. I like the coop element and the game timer that can cause all to lose. Also like the fact that cards can get pulled from your hand.

Legendary plays very similar to Ascension, but a few changes make it work great for me, while I still really dislike Ascension. The main difference is that you can play it co-op.

Really fun game that takes me back to my childhood. I used to read a lot of comics and loved watching the X-Men cartoon. It's awesome to get to play as these characters I used to read and watch and it's crazy how many characters are included in the game, Heroes and Villains. I like the co-op vibe but we also love to compare our scores at the end to see who gets bragging rights. Although it may seem that the best move is always obvious there is still some cool decisions to make depending on if your trying to help the team or play for the win at the end. Some of the cards can create some crazy combos and it's amazing when someone has a turn that provides an insane amount of attack power and they just rip apart the villains.

This game is great. It moves quickly and takes about forty-five minutes to an hour. Legendary offers plenty of replaybility and there are substantial expansions if you need more. There are a few problems with this game. Setup usually takes 25 minutes which is almost as long as the game itself. Tear down takes 15-20. The game seems too easy at times. Some games are won really easy without the feeling that you are anywhere near close to losing. Someone will have to try different difficulty settings to find their perfect level. This is also a reason why I like this game. It doesn't murder you every time you play like most co-ops and you feel like you can win it. Finally, many of the villains are unknowns to me which weakens the theme. I have only watched cartoons like Spiderman and Xmen growing up. I have read very few comics growing up. This causes me to look at many of the villains and henchmen and wonder who these folks are. That does detract from the immersion that I would like as I play. But all of this can still not take away from how great this game is. Great quality components and hundreds of cards for a reasonable price. 

UPDATE: So everything I have said originally is true about the base game without the cards sleeved. But I have since purchased three big box expansions and two small box expansions. I have also sleeved all my cards and printed out customized dividers. I have shortened setup and tear down substantially, and utilize Thomas Nute's randomizer app for ease of setup and the ability to get different combinations. This game is really hard now most of the time, but beatable. With the expansions this game moves up from a 7.5 to a 9, and has become one of my most played games. I don't even like co-ops, but this one is phenomenal with the expansions. *** Wife:9

I am not an avid reader of Marvel comics, so my lack of knowledge of the Marvel universe of characters meant that I was looking at the game from more of a mechanical perspective than a theme perspective (and theme matters to me). As a player of other deck-builders, this game seemed inordinately fiddly and involved to set up in comparison. That's a bar that I would not personally care to vault, so I would never suggest this game. If someone else sets it up and cleans it up afterwards, and the group wants to give it a go, I'd play. Otherwise, I'd leave it.

Played this game after complaining that it came from Upper Deck (said I would never buy anything from them game related again because of VS. and WoW card game), much to my surprise it was fantastic! 

I think the design of always having 5 (sometimes more sometimes less) Hero's in the deck and having the villains random makes for a game that is never the same twice deal. 

I had one card come damage when purchased from a sealed box, and will hopefully be able to get it replaced soon.

What a fun deck-building game, and although I "like" many of the heroes in the game, I've never read any of the comics.  Still, this is an awesome little game, I need to play more of the various villain and scheme combinations before rating it, but I can say it's a lot of fun.

I just really don't like the ascension style deck building mechanics.  The super hero theme doesn't really come across for me in the game.  With everyone grabbing a variety of super hero actions, the game loses any real distinction between players.

RATING: 10
A cooperative deck builder with the heroes (and/or anti-heroes) of the Marvel universe taking on one of many masterminds attempting to complete a nefarious scheme. Gameplay is simple enough and does not take too long to teach. There is an amazing amount of replayability with different heroes on the team, different masterminds, different villains, and different schemes all possible to change the experience.

But it is the great deal of expansions that make this game so great. Adds various new mechanics and an outstanding host of characters to choose from. But with more expansions, it can get harder to teach since some of the mechanics need a bit of explaining. More options will also lead to taking longer to set up and put away. The board is a bit too large and I do not think it needed to get that way. The art is great on all the cards and I have found myself looking up some of the artists to see their other work. My favorite deck builder and one of my favorite games.

RATING: 7
Take my word for it- This game is best when playing with the really hard scenarios. The first couple times I played, there just wasn't enough of a threat for the players to cooperate at all. Things really get interested when someone has to choose between possibly causing a group loss or beating the enemy that's maybe not worth many points in the long run.
Like any good cooperative game, you should always be on the edge of defeat. Legendary would do well with a printed guide for villain difficulty levels. Also, I'm a bit disappointed by the lack of variation in the card art (though I guess this is getting fixed in the new edition?)

Overall: There's a good game in this box. It takes time to find the best combinations but it's worth it. Also, Legendary could be greatly improved with future expansions. Looking forward to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I am a sucker for deck builders, I admit.  While not particularly innovative, Legendary is a fun light game that can be enjoyed to some degree by anyone who likes Marvel comics.  

I bought this game with my sons, now aged 11 and 14, in mind.  The art is nice to look at, and the theme attracted the boys immediately.  The rules are pretty simple - reveal an enemy, play your cards, defeat enemies and improve your deck buy recruiting new cards.  There are, obviously, more rules wrinkles than that, but it's the general idea.

The theme in the game works well.  Many of the heroes have there own "feel" (they often somewhat specialize in a certain mechanic).  Whoever designed this did a great job, in my opinion, in that the mechanic often really fits the hero.

There is quite a bit of variability in setup with each game randomly determining a Mastermind, henchmen, villains, a scheme, and heroes.  So many combos here that I think it would be difficult to repeat one - especially if you get the Dark City expansion that effectively doubles your cards.

Bottom line - a game that plays relatively quickly that has an attractive theme and art with lots of variation.  It is straightforward enough for kids to be able to play but has enough twists and turns to keep me entertained as well.

RATING: 9
Deck builders are probably my favorite type of game, and Legendary is an excellent one.  The sheer volume of expansions (see below) mean it will take a long time to run out of material.  

This takes the Ascension model of deck building (a central row of cards to buy, instead of the Dominion set stacks) and adds a separate row for villains to defeat.  One of my problems with Ascension (which I have only played the app) is that sometimes you will build a combat deck expecting monsters to come out, but very few monsters do.  Legendary fixes this by having two separate purchase rows, one for adding cards to your deck and one for removing threats.

My only real complaint is the tallying up of points at the end of the game.  I love cooperative games, and this game is an amazing one.  Tacking on a competitive element at the very end of the game just to have a singular winner was a misstep.  I don't even teach that part of the game anymore.  Unfortunately this makes some heroes like Black Widow less useful, though the addition of new bystanders with special abilities in subsequent sets ameliorates this slightly.

It is a fun deckbuilder.  Play's a bit like Ascension, but you can vary the card pool like Dominion so has a lot of replayability.  The fact that each player builds their deck from all the available heroes goes against the thematic feel of the game though.  It is semi-cooperative but the competitive feel comes through well enough.  It isn't less competitive than most other deck builders, only you score points AND defeat the villain.

I own this game for several months now and I think this game is really awesome. At first I gave this game a solid 7, but several months later I still play the game a lot, and for that alone I think it’s worth a 8.5. With most of my games I loose interest after playing it a dozen times. I play this game at least once in two weeks and it is still great fun. The reason for this are the smart game mechanics. You choose the Mastermind you would like to battle and which heroes you would like to use for that. There are also different “schemes” that makes the game more unpredictable. With the different combination of schemes, heroes and masterminds you’ll have huge different variations of the game. 

The only reason why it is not a 9 or 10 is the artwork. The game comes with several heroes and for every hero there are several different type of cards that you can play. Instead of making a new artwork for every different type of card, the creators used one artwork for all the cards for one hero. With the Dark City expansion they got clever and every card had his own artwork. The artwork itself is beautiful and gives a great look and feel for the game. The (lack of) artwork on the game board is a bit boring. They should have made it a bit more exciting.

Another deck builder using Ascension as a springboard and adding a cooperative element as well as faction building as in Star Realms. As with Ascension, there is not much strategy as there are not a lot of decisions to be made during each turn. Nevertheless it is fun and the theme well integrated. My two 16yo boys love it. Just ordered the Guardians of the Galaxy expansion.

This game captures the theme very nicely, the gameplay is smooth and fits in an adequate timeframe that does not overstay its welcome. Better-than-expected. Not enough dividers once you add the expansion. A disappointing oversight. The set up time is a chore and this why it rarely hits the table these days. I wish it was a not a "co-op but not really" game.

Update - the set up destroys this game. Very difficult to justify playing it when "equally as good games" Star Realms and DC deckbuilder have no set up time. It will stay as a near miss for us.

RATING: 7.2
My initial reaction to this game was that it was a lot of fun. I enjoyed my first couple plays a lot. The variability of the interacting schemes, masterminds, and villains promises a lot of replay-ability and seemed to insure that each game would feel a little different.

After playing this a few times, though, I'm starting to see some interesting flow issues arise. Some hero/ villain/ mastermind/ scheme combos make this feel very fast paced and smooth. Others can stall the game quite a bit. Just picking random heroes seems like a very bad idea... they really need to play off of each other. You can get bad combos in other deck building games as well, but the effect a bad combo can have on this game can make it quite tedious and pretty much unplayable.

There also seems to be a bit of a runaway leader issue in this game. I think this is actually a side effect to one of the things I really liked about this game: there is a separate victory point pile, so that victory points don't clog up your deck. 

I also get a bit of the Ascension blues with this game. I dislike having such a limited choice on what I can buy on my turn. Five heroes choices just isn't enough, especially if/when you get several high costing heroes clogging up the works early in the game. I wish there was a way to clear out the options and draw five new cards at the start of your turn.

Overall it's a pretty nice system, but with some issues. And you have to be a little more thoughtful when setting up the card selection at the beginning of the game than you do with some other deck builders.

This game was reasonably fun, and I would likely play it again if asked. The only reason this is not a "7" to me is that the text is small and hard to read across the table. A lot of time was spent just reading the cards that were coming up onto the board.

I suspect it would become a 7 if we changed the rule about KOing heroes when a villain escapes to just get rid of the left-most hero in the HQ. (This would reduce reading.)

30-01-2014. Rated after 3 plays. I genuine like the game quite a bit. I have the feeling you really do need to estimate your level of difficulty pretty easily, since if you're defeated or win the game too easily, the game is decidedly less fun as when you're under stress.

I think it's unfortunate but understandable that they have not chosen for different artwork for the different cards of the same characters.

Otherwise pretty straightforward deckbuilding game. I like it, and I like it more than Dominion, since it provides a purpose for the game. But it's nothing new of particularly innovative except that it's a coop.

Legendary is truly fun to play. As of this writing, April 16, 2014, Legendary is my favorite deck pooling game.

Legendary is a cooperative deck pooling game where the players play as super heroes trying to stop a Mastermind villain before he can fulfill his evil plan.

While I am not always big on theme, I think theme is the best place to start for Legendary. Not only is the game packed with theme, the theme is wonderfully worked into every aspect of the game. The theme is very integral to the game and fits the mechanics fantastically. I think the theme is a large part of what makes the game so much fun to play. Playing as a super hero is just fun.

Also of note is the great artwork on the cards. The artwork gives players a great feeling of being in a comic book. It is really well done.

The players must work together to fight against the game, the Mastermind villain. Each turn the player acts as the bad guy, then he gets his own set of actions to fight against the bad guy.

The deck pooling mechanic is handled nicely. By now I am sure every gamer knows and understands the Dominion deck pooling mechanic. Legendary offers nothing new this the tried and true mechanic, but it does work very well.

Legendary does offer a new and rather ingenious system for stacking combinations. It is this system that helps make the game so much fun to play. The heroes each have a certain type and an affiliation. These types and affiliations work together to form chains that stack into combinations. Playing multiple heroes of a given type and/or affiliation combine together to form bigger bonuses and attacks. It is these stacking combos that make the game a treat to play. Choosing the right heroes for your deck to continue your chain of combos is an important part of the game.

The actions of the Mastermind villain is handled randomly by using a deck of cards built just for him. I think this works very well and gives an element of suspense to the game.

Legendary has extreme replayability. Each game is governed by a plot the Mastermind is trying to accomplish. There are many different plots to play through. I find this a great way to keep the game fresh.

Additionally, the difficulty of the game is extremely flexible. The heroes you choose have a huge impact on the games difficulty. You can directly effect the game difficulty by the choice heroes. This is great way to scale the game down for new players or ramp it up for experienced players.

Legendary scales extremely well from being a solo game to holding several players. This is mostly due to the fact that the game is essentially a multi-player solitaire game. Each player acts independently, yet all players must work together to defeat the Mastermind.

This multi-player solitaire design becomes overly complicated with the addition of a competitive element. While all players must work together, each player is also competing against each other to see who can fight the Mastermind most. I really do not like this cooperative/competitive design. I strongly believe a game should be either cooperative or competitive, but not both. When I play I make the game a completely cooperative game and totally eliminate the competitive aspects. The game works better this way.

I can say that the set-up time for the game can be severe. The players will have a deck of heroes to build decks from. The Mastermind will also have a deck to draw cards from and run the game. Both of these decks will need to be set-up prior to playing and does take some time. This could turn people away from the game.


Pros - 
- Easy to learn
- Great theme that works very well

***This game is scored including the expansions


[b]-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------[/b]


Here I will discuss the Legendary expansion [thing=137762][/thing].

The first expansion for Legendary adds a lot to the base game.  In fact, it literally doubles the size of the base game.  Twice as many heroes are now available.  Twice as many Masterminds with twice as many plots are now available.  This goes a long way to increase the games replayability even further.  

The new heroes have new abilities that trigger with the proper stacking of types and affiliations in combinations.  The new abilities are fun and help the players in the struggle against evil.

The new Masterminds are now more powerful as well and bring their own new abilities to the fight.  A few new Masterminds are truly deadly.

The new plot Schemes are fun and offer some really well thought out challenges for the players.

In Dark City the artwork is not really improved from the base game, but it is enhanced a bit.  By that I mean that each hero no longer has a single picture representing all his cards.  Now each hero has three or four different pictures.  Each picture represents the different abilities of that hero.  I like the new artwork as it helps differentiate the various abilities and skills each hero has.

Other than the new heroes, Masterminds and plots mentioned above, this expansion changes nothing from the base game.  The same mechanics and rules set are used.  This expansion does not alter the game in any way.  It simply adds to it.  I think that is good thing since the base game is well designed.

While this expansion does not change the base game, it does add enough new content to make me want to reevaluate my scores.

Here I will discuss the Legendary expansion [thing=142020][/thing].

This expansion is much smaller than the previous expansion.  Fantastic 4 brings 100 new cards to the game in the form of 5 new heroes, 2 new Masterminds and villains and a few new plot schemes.

As stated by the name, this expansion deals only with the addition of the Fantastic 4 hero group to the base game.  Everything in this expansion is based around the Fantastic 4 hero group.

The new heroes are all the members of the Fantastic 4.  The new Masterminds and villains are the natural enemies of the Fantastic 4.  The new plot Schemes are all in line with events from the Fantastic 4 story.

The new heroes offer the players a few new special powers to aid you in the fight.  These, of course, are offset by the new powers the of Mastermind and villains.  

I very much like that this expansion is small and set toward the one hero group.  With only the single hero group being used, you can completely make the game about that one hero group.  By using only the cards in this expansion, everything in the game totally surrounds, and becomes about, the Fantastic 4.  This gives the player a great feeling of immersion and truly brings out the flavor of the game.

Once again, this expansion does not change the base game in any way.  It simply adds to it.  This still works for me as the original design works so well.

I do enjoy the new additions this expansion brings.  However, I do not think it offers enough to alter my scoring of the game.  Therefore, the game carry the score when this expansion is included.

Here I will discuss the Legendary expansion [thing=149922][/thing].

This write-up might look like a direct copy of the one above.  That is because it is.  At this point the expansions are fairly pre-set.  Simply replace all instance of one hero group with another hero group and the expansions are identical.  I see this as a good thing.  The base is so much fun to play, that changing it would be bad.  By just adding the new heroes and villains the game takes on their feeling yet stays the same.

Here I will discuss the Legendary expansion [thing=163106][/thing].

As with the other Legendary expansions, this will look very familiar due to the small box expansion are all following the same blueprint.  But I really think that is a bonus.  The small box expansions allow the game to fully take on the flavor of a given hero group.

This expansion is centered around the Guardians of the Galaxy.

The new pieces are the same.  5 Heroes, 2 Villain groups, 2 Masterminds and 4 new Schemes.

This expansion also brings in a new mechanic by using Shards and Artifacts. 

Shards are collectible items that subsidize Attack when used.  But it is tricky because both Heroes, Villains and Masterminds can gain and use Shards.   Using the Shards is fun new addition and a big tool in fighting evil.

Artifacts are really just Heroes or Villains that stay in play and give a bonus or usable power each turn.  This is also a fun new addition to the mechanics and brings with it a small level of tableau building.

Overall, this is a fun new expansion and brings two good new mechanics to the game.

Legendary is like Dominion in terms of deck building, only it is cooperative, and you pit drawings of sexy superheroes against drawings of sexy supervillains, and try to protect the much, much less sexy citizens from the carnage. Recommended, but I would expand to make it more challenging.

I've had this game for a while now, but haven't played it a lot in the last couple of months. Making it part of my 10x10 challenge helped me get back in to it. The only really bad things I have to say about it is that setup and tear down takes a while. I'm also struggling to fit all the (sleeved) cards in the base box, but others have managed it, so I probably just need to rethink how I put them away.

The game itself is fun. At times a walk in the park, at times nigh impossible to beat. I mostly play it solo, but when introducing it to new people, it takes minutes to explain, a couple of rounds to play and everyone's usually on board with what's going on. In itself, it's a basic deck builder with a Marvel theme and Marvel art. You'll probably either like it or you won't.

I'll probably play this any time someone asks, unless there's a time constraint or there's something else I really want to try out first.

Wow!  I can't believe my wife and I had waited so long to play this game.  Halfway through our first play we were hooked.  I would describe this as a mix of DC Deck-Building Game and Sentinels of the Multiverse.  I'm getting ready to play the heck out this and can see this replacing some of my other deck building games.  Must play!

Thematically, maybe the first box should have been The Avengers vs. their archrivals, rather than the most popular Marvel heroes vs. the most popular Marvel villains. Because it felt rather disjointed that The Hulk and Deadpool were fighting Dr. Doom. Bwuh? Also, you recruit heroes with SHIELD agents. Which never happened in the comics. Other than that, each hero has a different way of play, which I think is great. Some cards from different heroes synergize with each other, adding to the uniqueness of each combination of heroes! 

*****

I still don't get what my deck represents. If I'm playing solo, it's a team of superheroes taking potshots at villains. Okay, that makes sense. But if I'm playing cooperatively, and your deck and my deck have the same superhero card, then what? Does that mean Hawkeye is jumping around between  our groups shooting arrows and stuff? And why is Dr. Doom hiring the Brotherhood of Mutants and using Sentinels? I don't remember him doing that in comics. And why SHIELD agents? I think with the Ultimate universe and movies SHIELD agents recruited superheroes, but in most comics story arcs, the superheroes acted on their own. The mechanics are just fine, but they really don't fit the mechanics well (cf. Dicemasters).

Love the theme, but this game is just not fun. Also the artwork should have at least SOME variety. Overall a negative experience for me, though I would play if coerced and I've never quit on it mid-game.
Update-- Expansions really help this game and do add variety to character cards. Still just an okay game in my opinion, but much better than the base game alone. 6/10 with expansion(s).

Extremely lack of balance!!! My gaming group has played this game serval times. We followed the first time setup recommended in rule book. The first game is very easy for amateur. It makes perfect sense to make first game easy so that everyone can be familiar to the game. However in next serval games, we choose everything randomly. That’s heroe, mastermind and villains. Then mastermind became unbeatable and the game is completely broken. We have played other card building game. We all know it is very important to remove useless and low value card from your deck. But this feature is highly depending on the villains and mastermind chosen. The price of the game is quite high, around five times of some mini games. We are very disappointed because we would have much more better experience by paying around one-fifth price. The only thing I am glad is the expansion packs weren’t purchased. Avoid the spam. DO NOT NOT NOT buy it.

One of the single most boring games I have ever played, and that includes Love Letter. I played cooperatively, just for clarification. Don't be fooled by the fact that this game has Marvel characters in it. They are just images on cards. If you want a truly thematic superhero game, try Sentinels of the Multiverse.

It's based on comics and that really comes through in each and every card.

While I've only played Legendary once and Legendary Encounters a few times, the base games in this series always feel a bit too scripted for me.  Anything with a rotating center row feels very limiting and the decisions just aren't there in my opinion.

great to play with my kids, a kind of game I don't play all that often...the genre of co-op where you won't lose, but you might not do as well as your fellow players. a far cry from my fave co-ops where you die early and often--my kids hate those (R. Crusoe, Knizia's LotR, Ghost Stories, etc). 

very light, and a lot of set-up, but not so bad, esp with children.

RATING: 6
1 play solo.  It is ok but not great.  I really think sentinels deck per player approach far more captures the genre.  This felt like dysfunctional Avengers Assemble.  Lets fight Hydra, are we all here, no just 2 of us, the other Avengers are on vacation.  Sentinels every hero takes a turn approach is more in the style of a superhero group comic.  I did like it better than Ascension.  Seemed like there were some issues with the solo variant as cards that helped other players were useless.

Maybe with more players you get a better feel for a group of hero battling it out.

After the second play it is clear it needs sleeves.

RATING: 9
I have seen the light - this game really is a solid challenger to DOminin in my estimation. Incorporates elements of Nightfall and Ascension - both of which I personally pretty much loathe - into the deck management and point chasing of Dominion. Loads of interesting interactions in this game - like the way you can have a feel for the strategies available in a given set up by the types of cards expected in each heroes cards - but no guarantee that the killer combos will end up in your hand. Really, really good as a competitive game, plenty of opportunities in most set ups to spite your 'allies'. The master villain is such a great take on the Province Deck - victory points sitting outside your deck make decks generally more fun to play and less prone to choking, but there's still plenty of challenge in building a good deck. I think that people might have a bit less fun playing this purely cooperatively - would get too repetitive, be too long, and too easy - but maybe I am too competitive to appreciate that. Great design. The Punisher thinning out the Shield Agents in your deck being thematically explained as exterminating bent cops is one of the delightful little details. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A big colourful production that will be one for the Marvel fans who want to get into that world. For the rest of us the theme doesn't compensate for the lack of interesting decisions. It's not that there's no decisions - there's many little decisions as to what to recruit and what to kill - it's just that the those decisions are micro managing and not terrifically meaningful.

Quite a long setup and packing away time will probably mean we won't see this hit the table so often around these parts.

Played this a lot when it first came out, and was my group's main deck builder. It hasn't held up as much over time for me - I have a hard time seeing the strategies of how to build your deck, because of the limited card pool. Probably would play better at 2-3 players, and I usually play at 4-5, which may explain my sour attitude.

Terrific game that delivers a strong flavour of superheroics. I gave up calculating how many possible combinations of cards there are when I exceeded one million (base set + three expansions) and that's partly why I want to keep playing - who's coming to the fight this time? The game feels balanced in terms of how often the heroes save the day versus the Masterminds gaining the upper hand and I have wait for the story "To be continued...". 

A very popular title at my games club; updated from an initial 8 to 9, and now to 10, the games just gets more entertaining with each expansion.

Even though I love superheroes and like deck-builders, I find I still haven't warmed up toLegendary after three plays. It's got a poor board and even worse rule book but the card art is nice. I am wondering if adding an expansion might help as I find some components of play in the base set (like the covert action ability for example) isn't adequately covered with the included hero decks. Will need to play a few more times to come to a more solid opinion.

A terrific blend of deck building mechanics with the license.  The key is the Mastermind/Scheme combo that can make each game fresh.  very easy to add difficulty as well (we currently always put in at least one more Scheme Twist).

This game just didn't work for me. I think it could work if it were recast as a purely competitive or purely cooperative game. It didn't help that the game was incredibly easy to win with the settings we played on, but I think that the system is fundamentally flawed.

Semi-cooperative games can work when you need to balance your personal needs against the needs of the group as a whole. In Marvel, doing what's best for you will usually be good for the group as well, and hurting the other players a little bit incidentally won't really matter if it ever comes up in the first place. Semi-cooperative works much better in Archipelago.

If it wants to be cooperative, it needs to be MUCH harder. Regardless of whether it wants to be cooperative or competitive, it would really benefit from more interesting card interactions. Cooperatively it's just easy and boring. Basically the opposite of Ghost Stories. Competitively it's not interesting, and the theme isn't well integrated. Basically a less interesting and more bland Ascension.

A lot of people recommend this as a gateway game - personally, I'd rather start someone on Dominion than Legendary, since I've found that the faction-ability triggers confuse new players (i.e. new to the hobby). That being said, this is a great game with a lot of replayability and is lightweight enough to teach just about anyone, if you don't mind clarifying some of the more confusing rules several times.

Rating adjusted from 8 to 9 due to the inclusion of the Dark City expansion. To really have the game shine, you need that.

Edit: after some time it gets old(er). Still ok but not a 9 I gave it after my initial enthusiasm.

Edit again 2016: after playing this with my wife and son I must say with 3 persons it's very very enjoyable and tight!

Edit 2017: while still enjoyable now and then, I'm not going to be the one to suggest this game. It's lite, it has no pretence at being strategic or even tactic. It's just a good time with Marvel Characters. One reason I decided to bump down the rating was the fact I have no real interest in buying some of the recent expansions (anymore). That's to say I'll make an exception for the X-men expansion.

The game can be super fun and challenging, but I'm giving it a lower score for the overall ish art especially of the women which is for the male gaze.

It's kinda boring visually.

After falling in love with Legendary: Encounters, we decided to check out the original Marvel version. So happy we did as we like it even more! We own everything Legendary and keep an ear out for any and all new expansions on the horizon. I've printed colorful dividers! The amount of combinations of heroes/villains/schemes is immense. Sometimes, you might get hosed by a particular tough combo, but it's still fun for me. I don't mind some randomness in games when they are cooperative in nature. We never play Legendary competitively. We may count up points afterwards, just so we know for bragging rights, but during the game- it's all about cooperation and handling the oncoming hoard of enemies as best we can. This game is marvelous!! (See what I did there.)

Over 60 years of Marvel heritage and they had to pick the MOST garish, worst art for the game. Looks like they were stuck in '90s Liefeld mode. Remember the dime-a-dozen Marvel Trading Cards from the 90s? Now bargain bin fodder? Well, the art's as bad as that.

I can think of plenty of artists whose work could be plastered over the cards and box, improving it greatly.

Barry Windor Smith
Jim Lee
John Romita Jr
The Kuberts
John Cassaday
etc etc.

The gameplay is dull and procedural: by making the game a co-op, the tension in rushing to victory disappears. The game in unnecessarily overproduced: ditch the board and reduce the price please. A shame as I like the Marvel Franchise.

Great deckbuilder. Amazing theme. Biggest drawback is setup and tear down time - this can be improved with good organization and prep... but it's a blast.

RATING: 9
This is the start of a very good game. It needs the Dark City expansion to really take off but very much an easier game with less players 3 is kind of the games sweet spot and 5 makes it too clunky and random.
------------------------------------------------------------Jan 2017 - This should be played cooperatively with the secondary objective to see who wins.  Once you add the expansions this becomes on great game.  The story arcs you can create are so much fun. If you like comics or the Marvel movies this is the game for you. As for expansions either get them all or target your favorite heroes.  Dark city is the only must have.

I am an art fan. The base set is disappointing in this aspect because of the duplicate arts for 15 super heros. Thye improved this in the expansions. However, they don't bother perfect their own product, but try to create new expansions. Redesign and reprint 165 cards with 45 arts are not so difficult. Many companies do corrections and improvements either by release another edition (e.g. print 2 and print 3 of Descent 2nd Edition), or by put the replacement cards in the expansion. (Mage Knight Lost Leigon. Note, they have adjustments to balance the game not because of error!). Upperdeck obviously did not do that well. Attitude and responsibility towards the community will always be appreciated.

I was hipped on playing this coop game with all those heroes all to realize that the game mechanic is at a pre-beta level. Feels almost like the game was put on the market too quickly. Could have been a lot better.

Really not that good of a game.

Pros: 
+Good quality components
+Nice original artwork
Cons:
-Game impossible to win with 4-5 Players
-Game artwork is repetitive (same art on all card for each hero) and separators are all the same with no artwork and no title..  this is lame.
-Gaming is boring. No real strategy to build your deck other than having highest attack value. Very light combos. Very limited card effects.

RATING: N/A
An overall fun game if you enjoy the superhero genre, otherwise it will be hit or miss.  If you play this as a pure co-op the game is somewhat of a joke unless you stack things heavily against you and have the Dark City expansion.  As a competitive game it is really just a take the best card available that you can purchase, lacking much in strategy.

Longer Version:
Competitive - I don't like the game as a competitive game.  It doesn't make sense to me thematically and just feels weird.  You also are really just taking whatever is the best card in front of you.  Very luck dependent on when things happen to appear.
Co-op - That said, the game wasn't meant to be a pure co-op and you can tell.  You need the Dark City expansion to make this even a bit fun.  The base game is just a joke for difficulty.  Even with the expansion you need to be familiar with the heroes + masterminds + schemes to give yourself a challenge.  You can also make it so it is nearly impossible to win with some setups.  There is also random card drawing that can change a setup into impossible to win, or at the same time turn it into a joke.  For the most part the game is just about getting past late game.  If you can survive to the point where your decks have gotten off the ground you have usually won.

I would give this a solid 10, but the learning curve could be steep for a person that has not had any background in deck builder board games.  The game has an excellent set of instructions, and online videos were also helpful.  There can be different outcomes of the game each time you play.  With the time intense thrill that Escape! gives with your favorite Marvel heroes along for the ride, this game has lasting excitement for any serious gamer.

RATING: 9
At first glance, this appears to be a simplistic deckbuilder which brings nothing new to the genre and can be played on auto-pilot. However, the breadth of the combinations of cards that you can use during any given session makes it as difficult or as easy as the cards you chose during the game setup. You can breeze through a certain scheme and then get trashed when playing it again with a different combination. 

If you're a fan of superhero comic books, get this game. It doesn't make you feel like a superhero, but then again nothing does. What it does, however, is make you have fun while using the Marvel heroes we all learned to love. The art is absolutely fantastic, with the images on cards drawn by the Marvel artists. Certainly a game to show off to your non-gaming friends to wow them into the hobby.

Marvel témára épülő deckbuilding, amiben semmi újdonság nincs. Ascension-féle "piac", Thunderstone-féle ellenfélmozgás. Talán csak annyi új dolog van, hogy semmi-coop a játék, azaz a végén a szörnyek megöléséért járó pontok alapján lehet győztest is hirdetni, ha sikerül a főgonoszt megölni. A játék nagyon szép, nagyon tetszett a grafika, de számomra a téma nem jelent semmit, nem láttam, olvastam egy marveles dolgot sem. Így ezért 6 pontot adok, amúgy akár 7 is lehetne. Mert ugyan semmi új dolog nincs, mégis tökéletesen működik és nagyon szép a játék.

[i]Boring.[/i]

Does not feel like a Marvel game or a super hero game for that matter, super swingy from the opening hand to the finish, and worst of all, the "semi-Cooperation" does not work because like most deck building games there is a slippery slope at play here where you fall behind and no longer have any incentive to help the "team" (you can easily tank to make everyone lose)

One might say that the idea is not to pull so far ahead that you incentivise anyone to do that. That sort of makes sense, I guess. But still does not feel very satisfying, and the game is not as fun as it should be.

Legendary: Marvel isn't the greatest implementation of the deck building concept. It reminds me of Ascension, but with an obviously better theme. I never really get the sense of building an engine, but it's there. The strength of this game lies in the theme and the numerous options there are to customize. And the cooperative play is enjoyable and is ultimately why I decided to keep this game. It's always fun to play and I can help and teach the others at the table. Not the brightest star, but it still shines.

RATING: 6
I guess it is better than Thunderstone, which it clearly is paying homage to, but there is quite a bit of set-up and break down. All in all I found it a bit repetitive and anti-climactic. 

I also don't understand why they didn't just license great images from the comics so that each card could have individual art and character. The font is super tiny and the title is a thin yellow on colors so you never really know which character card you have. Individual art would at least give visual clues between the different cards.

I like DC's better.

Decent game which is overrated. I like most of the design decisions and the aspect of the game fighting back against you which I assume is mostly designed to counter runaways leaders rather then actually be co-op. However, too much luck for a competitive game(give the next person a trash card for you drawing a boss...really?) and the lack of art variation for different cards holds it back. Also, I really don't feel the theme that much even though that aspect is praised for this game

This takes the deck building genre, re-skins it with an awesome theme, and turns it into a co-op experience fighting the most notorious villains in the Marvel universe.  This is already a great premise for a game.  I wish the game had the same level of complexity as Legendary Encounters: there's no sense of continued combat after a card escapes.  I have the similar gripe that I'd like to see more depth in the deck building aspect so that deeper deck engines can be explored.

Thank you, 2014 Secret Santa! 

Semi-cooperative deckbuilder.  Marvel Legendary has its flaws (i.e. setup time), but overall, it is a solid deckbuilder with a great theme - provided that you go into the game expecting to play as a group of bickering mid-level SHIELD dispatchers vying for a big promotion from Nick Fury.  Personally, I love it.

I enjoyed this game a lot more than I expected to. While it is a traditional deck builder, there is enough to it that is different from the others that I own to really make it stand out.

The favorite game in my collection. 

+ The Marvel Superhero theme
+ Ton of replayability by playing different heroes, villains, masterminds and schemes which can vary from being a small change to a radically different game.
+ The artwork is phenomenal
+ Can play from 1-4 players easily (have not played with 5 yet)
+ A lot of expansion options, but it does not feel mandatory for best enjoyment (maybe the Dark City expansion, but it's mostly just buying expansions which have characters you might want to add or a few small new mechanics)

- The card quality is not top-notch
- Some setups are utterly unwinnable and unfair

Its a coop game but not a coop game

In the end for me the killer was that even with the harder difficulties it was still to easy.  Also it really does not scale well with more players. It becomes hard simply for the fact that you cant ever get a  good deck going and the board is overloaded

This is quite well done for a super-hero deck-builder. It needs to make up its mind between full co-op and semi-co-op, though. I think it fails as a semi-co-op and is too easy as a full co-op. Having trouble finding the right difficulty tweak.

1 play, probably with a bad (random) mix of cards: Mr. Sinister (who likes to capture Bystanders) and Black Widow (who can just kill villains/minions with Bystanders).

The game is sort of a mix of Thunderstone and Ascension, with a comic theme. Villains march into town in random order, have some effects when they appear and when you fight them. Here, they continue marching out of town (escaping), triggering a scenario-specific result. Similarly, heroes available for purchase march into display randomly. Each turn you draw a villain card (either a villain, or a card triggering some effect). Then use your hand: may use every icon and all text on all cards (i.e., you don't get to/have to choose between which parts of a card to use). At the end, discard all your cards and draw a new hand. But with no cheap-cost things to do (unlike Ascension, which has 1-cost cards and 2-cost monsters) you can end up just sitting around hoping for a good draw!

I was so bored -- very happy when the game ended! I might try this again, if someone really wants to play it; but it doesn't do a lot for me!

RATING: 9
I gave this a 9 because I like the Marvel theme, but there's lots missing to this game that the expansions (sometimes successfully, sometimes not) fill in. The starting game is not too complex for a Deck Builder. Sure, there are tons of cards on the table but it doesn't take too much to understand what happens each turn and what you have to do.

The real fun of this game you only get about half the time which is what my friends and I refer to as "popping off" which is when you get enough cards that your deck is actually working as intended and firing on all cylinders. I would say the two biggest flaws with this game are that this does not happen often enough and that some characters are way better than others and it's not always the fan favorite characters or most powerful characters.

Also something the expansions fix is that the character cards all have the same art.

Still the game is quite fun. I love the co-operative element which makes it feel like you are teaming together to take down the Red Skull or the like.

RATING: 8
This game is a mix between Ascension and Thunderstone that is played more cooperatively.  Like those games and many deck-builders before it I can already see myself losing interest with it after a number of plays without them releasing (and me buying) expansions for it.

I was super-excited for this game, it was the one game I wanted most for Christmas and with the Amazon gift cards I received for Christmas it was the first thing I bought.  I used to be a huge comic book junkie so obviously I knew I would love the theme (and I do).  From what I already knew about the game I even knew that its biggest failing would be its limited life span which is the biggest weakness (for me) of the deck-building game genre altogether.

The game has several other weaknesses though that I didn't (and couldn't) know until after receiving my copy and playing it.  The most glaring of which is the competitive element of the game and how it is integrated.  At first I thought it wouldn't be such a big deal; you play the game cooperatively and either win or lose as a team but at the end of the game each player receives points based on how much they contributed to the win.  That's not such a big deal, it's an added mechanic that comes "out-of-box" that I thought could just be completely ignored without affecting the game.  And it can be mostly ignored (which is what I would suggest because competing for victory points can hurt a cooperative experience as players compete for which cards give them the best chance to rack up victory points instead of discussing whose deck can best take advantage of those cards "for the team").  Where it still affects the game though is in the design of some of the cards.  A big example of which is one of the Hawkeye cards which gives you the option of forcing all other players to draw or discard a card.  I see no situation where forcing the other players to discard cards would be beneficial to them, and therefore the team.  Granted I haven't played with all the cards yet so there very well may be some positive synergy between discarding cards and other card effects.  You may also call this nitpicking since I could always just choose the "draw" option but the fact that the card is designed to allow you to hurt other players seems like a poor design choice to me and like I'm paying for a feature of the card when I recruit it into my deck that I won't ever use.  It also probably means other cards are designed with a similar "gotcha" mechanic on them.  All-in-all I just don't think "semi-cooperative" games really work.

A couple other of my complaints are small.  I'm annoyed that the game does not include randomizer cards or labeled dividers.  The games I've played so far have also been extremely easy with players defeating the Mastermind 4 times and coming nowhere near losing before getting through more than a quarter of the villain deck each time.  There are more difficult setups and easy ways to increase the difficulty printed in the rulebook so I withhold judgement on the difficulty until after adjusting it and getting more experience with the game.

Pass that, this is a solid enough game.  As I said above I love the theme and it doesn't feel completely pasted on.  Sure, theme is always going to be a little abstracted with a deck-builder but the abilities and stats printed on the cards match the character, scheme, etc. and how it pertains to the Marvel universe pretty well most of the time.  

It is also very well-designed with a lot of elements working well together.  We haven't found anything broken or too confusing yet.  This also points toward the rulebook being well-written as another boon for the game.  The packaging is good with room for expansions (although the box seems a bit bigger height-wise than it needs to be) and the art is beautiful.

All-in-all I had an enjoyable time playing the game.  It's not without its faults, the biggest one being the design of the competitive elements in this cooperative game.  But I can move past that and once I get the difficulty honed in to a more tense and enjoyable experience I can see myself getting a number of plays out of this right up until the inevitable expansion releases that should extend this game's lifespan even more.

My #1 favorite game! It is so incredibly fun. It usually feels like we will lose at the start, but then we get those combos working and it's such a thrill to come back and whop on the villains. The base game isn't really too hard, but you will lose from time to time. Where the game really shines is with a few expansions thrown. The combinations really become limitless at that point. It's perpetually fresh and infinitely repayable. Simply the best game there is.

My 2nd deck-building game experience, I really love the concept so I imagine it is hard for me to go wrong with a deck builder. Comparisons to the DC game are hard to avoid since thematically so close, I do like the DC better but this one is really fun, too.
Where it falls a bit short is the semi-coop idea. Semi-coop doesn't work for me (at least not here). To work together is fine but when in the end the points count again it easy to get screwed over, e.g. you are the nice guy to take less points or even wounds to make the game as a group, someone else cashes in instead and wins in the end. Can very easily happen, plus, the "together-against-the-game" feeling that makes coops so interesting never happens when you still eye your own points. 
But I had fun, the game is very enjoyable and I would play again. As in owning I would rather go for the DC but that is mostly personal taste I reckon.

It's not bad. Like the theming, though it's a bit pasted on. 

The one major problem that I ran into was that since it's a co-op, there is little incentive to "screw" other players over (intentionally or unintentionally) in order to improve your personal deck. All decisions naturally felt like they had to be most beneficial to the team which made decisions too obvious. In some ways the game felt like it played itself.

The other issue was that there weren't any serious consequences to deal with. Villains escaping, even getting wounded by a mastermind didn't really feel like it mattered that much. Might have to up the difficulty next time I play. 

All that being said my friends and I always like to make things competitive and amassing victory points, regardless of how meaningless and petty, was plenty of motivation for us to go at it. It played less like a co-op game and more like the board game equivalent of a multiplayer game of the new Mario platformers with everyone scrambling to beat everyone else even at the expense of others. 

When you play with a lighthearted mentality going into it, it's a lot of fun.

The theme feels tacked on and there are no difficult choices to be made as you can attack or buy as much as you want in a turn, provided you have the resources.  I was never so disappointed in a game as I was in this one.

My score has waffled back and forth over the years. But I believe my score is complete and will stay at 10 now. Here we are 5 years later, and even though I don't play Legendary as much as I used to, I always WANT to play it. I would never turn down a game. I love it, so even though it's not actually "perfect" I don't think a score other than 10 fits how I feel about it.

Take a little while to set the game up and the difficulty ramps hard with more players but its a great take on the super hero genre. I would appreciate a little more variance in the art too. :)

RATING: 10
I can not recommend this game enough. The base game can be really light on variety by itself with only 15 heroes, but with over a dozen expansions it really opens up endless possibilities with over 100 heroes.

Things I love about this game...
-Highly modular nature making no two set ups feel the same.
-Great art on the cards
-Great use of "mechanics as metaphor" such as the Spiderman and wolverine cards all doing low damage but power draw your deck simulating a flurry of attacks where cyclops and hulk have heavy hitting cards with drawbacks or how Thor has to "charge" his hammer to get damage by having recruit thresholds.
-Cooperative or competitive play styles are both welcome as you can opt to work together or fight tooth and nail to snag all the victory points you can.

As I stated earlier, the base game is a little light on variety, so I would highly recommend a couple of expansions. I would say the must haves are...
-dark city
-civil war
-x-men
-paint the town red
-guardians of the galaxy

Okay I have to admit that the game mechanic is mainly the same as ascension. Although the mastermind and the schemes do add some additional variety and fun. Still it is just some standard deck builder which has a lot of repetition.
Therefore the game as such will only get a 6.5
But it has a great theme and it is about Marvel Superheroes!! which will give it another 0.5
And finally it has S*P*I*D*E*R*M*A*N !!!!! 
So nothing more to mention about my rating :-)

I like this game a lot, but I don't like the card organization. It takes forever to set up. A different card back for the different card types would have been really helpful to just get it all sorted out. Maybe heroes one color and villains another. I think I like Sentinels of the Multiverse better. Your deck is already built for you, but the game is better organized, and the environment cards offer a little bit more variety.

My favorite game of all time! I've played over 1000 advanced solo games...this is not a typo! Obviously I wouldn't have played it so much if it wasn't amazingly fun. Entertaining schemes, endless combinations (so the game never gets boring), and most importantly, Marvel heroes! Game Designer Devin Low did a fantastic job of throwing together all the best parts of deck-building games with unsurpassed thematic tie-ins. And you can even change the level of difficulty to make the game as challenging as you'd like. But as fun and addictive as this game is, you will not be able to stop buying the expansions. Each one adds more flavor and more challenges. But don't take my word for it, try it for yourself. You won't be disappointed.

RATING: 5
My thoughts: the rules of the game are that everything is chosen at random.  The villainous mastermind, the henchmen, the evil scheme, and the heros.  This means the game can be anywhere from annoyingly difficult or ridiculously easy.  There is always the chance that it could be fun, enough challenge to get the player engaged, but not enough to make them feel useless.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Probably my favorite deck builder.  I think I would prefer it if the game were meant as a purely cooperative game.  It's not designed for that (and is too easy as a pure coop) but I don't know if the semi-coop fits the theme.  Sure super heroes can boast about who the best hero is but I would have liked it better as a pure coop.

Who cares!  It's a great game that lets my family and I play as some of our favorite super heroes.  A lot of variety with the amount of heroes (and combining them) and scheme twists comes in the box.

Most of my plays are solo.  I am not a big fan of how "easy" some of the villains are.  Doctor Doom should feel tougher.

I have ordered the expansion and I am eagerly anticipating playing.  I am concerned that the old villains will feel even weaker with the new powers of the soon to be arriving villains.  We shall have to put them to the test True Believers!

Update:  Just taught this game to my 6-year-old and she loves it.  She beat me in our second play too!  44-24.

Legendary is already one of our most played games and with my daughter requesting to play it now it may become our most played  game.

A lot like Thunderstone. Not quite as involved or interesting, but it plays a lot faster. Fun to play and fast. Thematically pretty weak, and there are a lot of poor physical design choices, such as nearly unreadable card titles.
I can't imagine playing this "co-op" without house rules, but competitive play is fine with 2 players; sounds like there are flaws with more.
At least one scheme has seemed pretty broken; a losing player was able to easily just force the villain to win.
Rating would improve at least a point with better art and card design choices.
My rating yo-yos a bit; I really hate it when we have a situation where a player can 'throw' a game.

I am a big fan of super-heroes, especially Marvel ones. I like this game very much, it's a good deckbuilder and has some very nice art. The thing is, I find it lacks theme. I don't feel like any kind of super-hero or leader of a super-hero team. I'm more like: "I did 33 damage, I wipe everything off the board!". Which is fun but missing that little bit of magical theming touch.

Excellent deck-building game, based on the Marvel Universe - 2 reasons that have enamored me to it.  The personalities of the heroes have been definitely captured in the game mechanics and the game is quite fun and challenging.  The fact that its a competitive game but dependent on some level of cooperation between  the players for an eventual win increases its fun for me.  I've shown it to many friends and family members and all have expressed a desire to play it over and over, even one whom normally doesn't like to play this type of game.  I'll be anxiously waiting for the expansions to roll off the line.

One of the more popular deckbuilding systems around today -- and for good reason! While the game is not as thematic as some players would like (you're more like SHIELD giving orders to the heroes than the heroes themselves), being invested in Marvel (or super heroes/comics) at some level will really add to your enjoyment of the game. The semi-cooperative aspect of the game is take it or leave it (it's "leave it" for me), but the mechanics work well overall. 

Ultimately, does Legendary: Marvel revolutionize the deckbuilding genre? No; it's rather derivative, in fact. However, what it does, it does well! If you're into deckbuilders or Marvel, give this one a shot.

I did have fun playing this set even though I don't play it anymore.  I can see how people prefer it over the DC dbg because it is a little more complex and gamer based.  It is fun and entertaining from a vs. aspect.  After bouncing back and forth between this and the DC dbg's I ended up going with DC.  My friends and I just like the gameplay and crisis expansions better.  The things that bothered me with this set is the art work on the cards being identical really dulled down how into the game I got. Also, the game being co-op, but having a winner at the end just wasn't something I liked. Some cards seemed unfair in the amount of points a player gets for defeating a villain or each one of a certain type in their victory pile.  Overall, even though I am on the DC side I am true to give an honest rating and the experience I had was still good playing this game.

Wow, this scales appallingly. An easy 2 player mission becomes almost impossible with 4 players.

This is a poorly designed mess.

I've played this twice now.  I'm not really into the Superhero thing, but the gameplay is quite interesting.

Yes, I feel like it's basically just an improved version of Ascension as far as gameplay goes, but brings back the harder setup time that Dominion and other Deck Builders tend to have that Ascension did away with.

However, even though I'm not all that into the Superhero theme, the gameplay is fun enough that I don't mind playing it.  I think it's better than the other Superhero games I've tried.

Heck, I'm not really into the deck building thing much either, but this game has two strikes against it, yet I still don't mind playing it.

This game can push you during the first part of the game and building up your deck can be fun, however you reach a point where people get enough fight in their deck and then the game becomes a matter of spending the time to win.  The tension does not escalate but suddenly disappears and comes down to just spending the time to get it finished.  I wish there was a way to keep that tension going to the end.

Something of a cross between Ascension and Thunderstone, but with Marvel Superhero theme. The theme really works here. The villans and the plots are a lot like a crazy comic series with your favorite heroes. 

The only drawback to the base is that it suffers from what most deckbuilders do when they first come out - a serious need for MORE cards. Yep, I'm ready for an expansion already. Oh, that and the setup/teardown time.

**UPDATE Dec 2014
One of my favorite games. I had to do some custom work with dividers and had to toss the insert that came with it (really a poor insert), but I can (barely) fit ALL the current expansions (through Guardians of the Galaxy) sleeved in the main box. The game still has setup/teardown pain, but the story of the game is still a blast to me.

**UPDATE Sept 2017
With the release of DXP (the digital re-theme) of the game, I realized how much I like this game and bumped it to a 9.5 (it is only not a 10 because of setup and teardown)

There are definitely flaws with this game (like the fact that they don't actually use the city track at all, the game scales very differently for 2-5 players, and the setup and tear down take a while).  BUT, I still have a lot of fun playing it.  I enjoy Legendary more than Dominion, but it obviously doesn't have the same depth and replayability with all the Dominion expansions.  I really like that you can play it cooperatively or competitively because it is like two different games in one.  The Marvel theme isn't as rich in the gameplay as it could have been, but I still think it's the best Marvel game out there.

Update: The Dark City expansion fixes many of the flaws in the base game.  Most of my plays are 2 player co-op with my wife, so I was very pleased to see the increased difficulty.

It's great as an introductory or a light deckbuilder. It's billed as 'semi-cooperative', but it is only so in the fact that everyone at the table can lose together. Each player though is still trying to get the best cards and defeat the most valuable enemies. On the fence as to whether or not I want the expansions, as this has been almost completely replaced by Legendary Encounters.

I liked both the theme and card powers in Legendary and very much enjoyed building a deck that performed in interesting ways. I'm not thrilled about the semi-cooperative aspect of the game, though, and if I pick this title up I will likely ramp up the difficulty a bit and play it as a pure cooperative where players win or lose as a team.

Elég jó kooperatív játék, de pont amikor kezd szuper lenni a decked és már csak 1-2 shield ügynök rontja az összképet akkor bumm végetér a játék. A setup is túl hosszadalmas amikor vennénk elő.

I am disappointed by this game. I was expecting more to the game than what is actually there. I feel as if there should be more to it than just playing and/or buying cards. There is no sense of adventure or exploration. I get BORED BORED BORED doing the same thing each round!

I don't enjoy fighting the masterminds, the battles feel unexciting. Even some of the other cards in the villains deck are dull when they come up.

I enjoy the deck building aspect more in Dominion than I do in this game. Overall, this game is boring.

I enjoy the Legendary games well enough, even if the core mechanics aren't super exciting.  But the theme - both micro and macro - comes through pretty well for a card game, and there's plenty of variety to keep it fresh.

This game is the gold standard for Deck Builders. Hero Realms is better at what it does, but Legendary is just so great in how much it can do. Mix and match your masterminds, villains, henchmen, scenario, and yes, your team... The heroes you pick interact ENORMOUSLY with your opposition, a solid team for one can be utterly disadvantaged elsewhere. Crank the difficulty up or down, plot endlessly with friends about set up possibilities, cackle and memorialize epic overkill wins, laugh at sudden massive defeats, and narrative to the way a game plays out to have your own stories. Play two players, play four players, play solo... do a full co-op, risk it all playing cutthroat to see who an nab high score. It's  replay isn't infinite, it took many, many games, but I'm a bit sick of it now. One thing I will say? Consider the Villain set heavily. Instead of the base set might be a bit weird, but multiple stages of design advancement really show in Villians and the core cardpool for players and challenges is much more fun.

RATING: 6
After 14 plays I think the game is fine.   Thematically its a departure from my other deck-builders, if nothing else. 
Strategically, its pretty much down down "focus on developing one or two heroes." If you water down your hand too much you'll not succeed.
Thematically there's the art, of course, and the abilities do tend to marry well with the actual heroes.  BUT I rarely find myself stopping to enjoy the theme.  More commonly, I am just number crunching without regard for the actual hero that the "number" belongs to.  Race for the Galaxy?

Thumbs up for the variety though. I plan on getting the reprint of Fantastic 4. That expansion isn't rated quite as highly as some others but to me it looks like some decent variety - that will thankfully deemphasize some of the mutant stuff.
Sentinels of the Multiverse is still superior.

Versatile deck builder. One of my favorites!
+ Easy rules
+ Single player friendly
+ Great artwork
+ Tons of variation by using different combinations of schemes, masterminds, villains, and heroes
+ Variable difficulty 

+- Lots of cards. Can be a pain to setup and teardown if you aren't organized. Using the included dividers and categorizing/alphabetizing helps a lot. 

- Artwork for a hero is all the same regardless of his ability
- Cards appear flimsy. Sleeved them just in case

I think I'm enjoying this more than I should given I'm not really into deck building games or comic books. Much better than Dominion and I've already ordered all the expansions plus the Alien Legendary game after a handful of plays!. Initial rating of 9.

10 plays: Have played through all schemes in the base game and have used all masterminds, villains, henchmen, and heroes at least once. Current record is 9-1, so suspect the base game is easy. Rating stays at 9.

20 plays: Having a blast but am 19-1 against the base game so my suspicions are confirmed. Awaiting expansions to up the challenge. Have now also ordered the Villains version. Stays at 9.

30 plays: Playing through Fantastic 4 expansion. Great game, despite 27-3 winning record. Stays at 9.

40 plays: Galactus makes the game a bit tougher. Winning record is now 34-6. On to Dark City. Stays at 9.

50 plays: Have now played through Dark City. Winning record is now 42-8. Great game. Stays at 9.

Super deck builder.
Kind of a hybrid between Ascension, Thunderstone, and Dominion, which means if you played any of these three, then you have some familiarity with the game mechanics of Legendary, but it still feels different enough to not be a total rip off.
Really fun to both work together to defeat the mastermind, yet also try to have the most points at the end to be the most legendary hero of all.

Popped my board game cherry, my first real board game purchase and this game is going to eat all my money. I'm a HUGE Marvel fan and this is the game I've waited for my whole life. The mechanics are not only sound but make sense for the theme. Spider man doesn't do a lot of damage but he's cheap and slings his other cards into action, and can give you a good idea of what's coming. Skrull can put a hurting on you (Super Skrull FTW) but their especially deadly when the utilize their shapeshifting ability. The ability to mix schemes with Masterminds and villains makes every game different. The game scales incredibly well, I've played with 4 people, I've played by myself. It's a great game for older kids, my 12 year old loves it, it's a great game for Dungeons and Dragons players. If you want a game that's high on replay, heavy on theme and elegant on rules, give this game a shot. If you're a fan of Marvel, you've wasted too much time reading this, buy this game.

Maybe it was the scenario that we played (or scenarios think we've played it twice) but I felt like this was just an okay game. I was hoping it would have a more thematic superhero feel to the game, but in the end it just felt like a deckbuilding game, not like we were dealing with Magento or whomever the villain was and it didn't feel like you had a superhero team up, it felt like you had a random collection of cards. The theme just didn't mesh well with the mechanics for me and it didn't have that superhero fighting feel I was looking for.

RATING: 9.5
How do I even begin with this game? It has everything that I look for in board games (more notably card based games):replay value, strategy, and theme. Nothing can top the replay value of this game: 8 different Schemes, different Villian groups, Heroes, Masterminds, there are abundant combinations. Strategy is minor but it's there, just enough for a card game. The theme is great, as all the art was fabricated exclusively for the game. I have heard plenty of complaints on the bordering system of the cards, but I actually like this idea. I went in knowing I was going to love this game, and I do. I think it will be my go to card game now, in loo of Dominion (no hate on Dominion, however). This game is teachable as well, and not too hard to understand. Upper Deck really accomplished something with this game. Expansions are DEFINITELY a future investment. Great game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a strong deck building game that will please fans of the genre, and offer some new elements to people that may not have enjoyed it in the past.

Legendary borrows from a few different titles, and seems to have the hit the right mix.  It is very similar to the Star Trek deck builder, with a smattering of Thunderstone, but it delivers a better experience than either in less time.

Each player gets to see an interaction with the villains every turn (for the most part)
***I've seen a few people comment that they don't like this is a co-op.  It isn't REALLY a co-op game, and you can mess with the other players.  Basically everyone loses or an individual wins.  You are definitely acquiring your own victory points, and you can wound other players intentionally if you want to.  I'd call this semi-coop at best.

My one gripe is that I wish the Hero deck had a bit more diversity during the game.  I realize they are intentionally allowing for combos, but it would be cool if they had gone for stockpiles of teams vs a single card or guy.  (ie, less iterations of spider man and more spidey characters like black cat, etc.)

12/4/2013 - Update

The veneer is completely off of this one for me.  At the end of the day... Legendary is just not all that fun.  The mechanic is very simple regardless of which scenario you're running or who you're up against.  You draw a bunch of cards with pictures of dudes, and have turns ranging from fair to epic.

People call this game thematic, but at the end of the day it really isn't all that much.  The variety of dudes and objectives is cool, but it doesn't translate to variety of actual gameplay or fun factor.

It feels cumbersome and non-engaging, and that is a damn shame.  I don't know what could make it better... it feels like it should awesome and it is just fair.

Dropping the rating to a 6 barring some kind of epiphany.  If you're looking for a great Super Hero card game, check out Sentinels of the Multiverse which is a much more thematic romp.

RATING: 6.5
[thing=129437][/thing] is a deck builder that brings some innovation to the genre, but not all that much. It owes many things to [thing=69789][/thing] and, of course [thing=36218][/thing]. It also has a lot of similarities to  [thing=125678][/thing], but the development of these occurred in parallel, so no foul play here.

[b]Which are the good points?[/b]
- [b]It is an easy game to learn and play[/b] (specially if you are used to any of the other games I mentioned earlier). In the first game we already used a random set up, and have no problem at all with this (well, expect a discussion to see if a color was really different from other);
- The [b]symbols[/b] in the cards, though they are tiny, are, for me,easy to see and to use;
- The [b]texts in the cards[/b] are clear and concise - in none of the cards was necessary to look into the manual to understand how they worked;
- [b] The art[/b]. It is good and with enough variation.

[b]Which are the neutral points?[/b]
[b]- Theme.[/b] It makes more sense than the one in [thing=125678][/thing], where the villains cards help your hero to attack other heroes, in order for you to win. In this game, the villains stay out of the deck (though it would be better if they didn't, in order to clog the deck, since, thematic, the villain would require constant attention to be held at bay). It is nice that the heroes can "help" each other in order to produce some combos;
[b]- The row of cards.[/b] I'm definitely not a fan of the row of cards for purchase. That thing that you buy some OK card, even with a lot of recruiting value, just to see an awesome card (that you could even take yourself, if it was, you know, there before). However, [thing=129437][/thing] saves itself a little for two things: 1) the heroes cards aren't worth victory points, which is different from what happens in [thing=125678][/thing], where not only the great card do some great effect, it is also worth a higher amount of points; and, 2) the row for the villains doesn't get "updated" everytime a villain is defeated, so this lessens the overall impact of the row (and, if you happen to have a tremendous attack, and no major villain to beat in the row, you can, and should, beat the Mastermind). Also, the villains appeared to be well balanced in their values and effects;
[b]- Cooperation.[/b] The heroes are, in thesis, all fighting the Mastermind, his scheme and his minions. So, there is cooperation? Well, there is, but a tinny little small bit. In the two plays I had, only a card from Emma Frost allowed the other players to draw new cards, if they had a X-Men card already in hand; and another card, that the player could choose another player to heal wounds; finally, in after defeating one of the "faces" of the Mastermind, it was possible to choose if the other players would draw one card or discard one card (it was choosen to discard). Of course, usually all the players will try to prevent the losing condition in the Scheme card to happen, and this we did. But there is nothing (except honor! And not being a jackass) to stop a player from giving up the fight, to make everyone losing a closer reality. It is basically as cooperative as [thing=18602][/thing], in which everyone work together to build the kings castle and citadel, and if someone uses a building of mine, I gain something - hey, cooperation!

[b]Which are the bad points?[/b]
[b]- The set up.[/b] It is sort of long. Not worst than the one in [thing=36218][/thing], but sure way higher than the one in [thing=125678][/thing];
[b]- The rich gets richer effect[/b] :shake: Seriously, what is the matter with these hero deck builders games with this point? The case here is less bad than the one I found in [thing=125678][/thing], but still is here. The defeated villains are the cards that are worth victory points (and, also, bystanders rescued). But they don't enter into your deck. So, it requires no ponderation whatsoever as to when you should stop the bulk of recruiting (preparation phase, several movies have it) and start beating villains. Maybe I was spoiled by the fine ways of [thing=36218][/thing] in this matter. In [thing=36218][/thing], with limited buys in your turn, and, mostly, because of the victory points cards serve as a break in every deck, you have always to consider [u]timming[/u] in every play. For me, for as long as the deck builders work around getting victory point cards, the cards that give you this, should remain as a natural break in the deck acceleration. In [thing=129437][/thing], once you achieve a value to beat any villain in the row, you will do it, without a second thought. Got an even higher value? Sweet! Beat some more! So there is no worries about "Damn, if I buy another Estate, my deck will be a swamp", nor "Great, now I got 8 money. What now? Do I buy a Province? This soon? It will stay in my deck the whole game...". Anyway, [thing=129437][/thing] deals with this better than his DC brother, if by nothing else, by nothing using the villains as great cards for any deck, and also by creating a sense of urgency that requires the heroes to start the punching soon.
But I still see this as a bad thing. If one player purchases one, two major great cards (whose others copies might never show up) it can get way ahead, with little chance for the other players to catch up. In [thing=36218][/thing] the victory cards would, usually, make this strong cards don't appear as often, and, even when they do come up, they could end up in a victory cards clogged hand.
I know this decision makes [thing=129437][/thing] to be easier to be introduced to new and/or less experienced players, since the timming issue in [thing=36218][/thing]  is something more complicated to be had and explained (and, also, the timming will change accordingly along with the sets of cards and what the others are doing), but in the long term this decision will be, for me, a bad one.

[b]Final thoughts:[/b]

[thing=129437][/thing] is a good game, with clear and functional mechanics. It is somwhat easy to explain and even if player with some background in [i]deck building[/i] games having a little advantage at first, even first timers will be able to make a nice heroic showing. The plays are usually quick, lasting around 40 to 50 minutes, and after them I stayed with a "want more" feel, not only because of the theme (which is dear to me), but also to see the interactions between other Masterminds, Schemes and Heroes.

The weak points in [thing=129437][/thing] are, in a lesser degree and amount, the same ones I notice in [thing=125678][/thing]: lack of thematic cohesion (for some reason I still keep wanting this in deack builders, but, so far, only [thing=53953][/thing] pleased me in this matter); the row of cards for purchase and fight; and the damned rich gets richer. However, even these points weren't enough to prevent me from enjoying the game - I still have a nice time playing. So I'm ready to play some more!

Not really a co-op game at all.  

It plays well, but can't help but feel the game isn't that deep, and the cards you end up with are a bit of a lottery.  

Also, once someone goes out in front, you can't catch up, as their hand is always great, and they can just get the best cards (afford them).

Maybe more games are needed for it to balance out, but so far, it doesn't really do much for me.

Great Marvel theme though.

The difficulty is stuck on one level, so once your deck gets going, time is the only factor against you. Plus quite some game effects offer advantages where you'd expect a disadvantage. For exemple, fighting the boss is done by taking one of his four hidden cards, of which you only know the health value. But being in the dark is never a problem and more often than not you're getting a present for punching him. I'd like it if you'd be set back a little, so you need to build again for the next punch.

The repetitive art and lack of flavor texts was a bit of a disappointment.

It's not a bad game though. Mechanically it works just fine, but thematically I'm not thrilled.

I didn't think the theme worked all that well, and I didn't feel I had very many interesting choices to make - there was usually only one thing I could buy or one villain I could defeat.

I think this would have worked a lot better if you started with a complete set of cards for a given hero and then could purchase additional smaller sets for other heroes, one-off pieces of equipment, etc.

Deckbuilder which plays quicker and easier than Thunderstone and has (much) more theme than Dominion. Perfect combination to get my rather non-playing wife into it occasionally (she did not care for the other two at all). Here in Germany Legendary is three times as expensive as Thunderstone so if you do not really look for quicker/easier Thunderstone is most probably the one to get. Thunderstone seems to be harder as well.

After trying all the early ones I decided I really don't like deck building games. Except this one. It's the scenarios that make it work for me. Nothing really to do with the characters as I'm only dimly aware of them, not a comic fan.

I'm not a huge Marvel guy, but this is a great light-medium weight deck builder. It plays in an hour or less, is very casual, and everyone feels like they have really cool things to do on [most of] their turns. With most deck builders, you draw your hand at the end of your turn, meaning the game moves very quickly.

One of the best card games I've played with the great theme of Marvel Comics.  Only knock I have on the game is the card quality could be higher.  Come on upper deck you know what a could quality durable card is,  you've been making cards since 1990.   Despite that though the game is great I would really recomend it to someone wanting a super-hero game.

Marvel Heroes deck building game.  Finally, a licensed Marvel game that is good!  Not that Marvel Heroes was all that bad, but for such a huge geek property there should be a bunch of great games.

Plays faster than Thunderstone with a IP that I really love.  Great art!  The fact that there are not different poses for each hero card is not a big deal for me.  In fact it makes tear down a lot easier.

The game is easy to learn and teach.  Combos are satisfying.  The rulebook is written pretty clearly.  All in all I'm very impressed.  I honestly did not expect much from Upper Deck.  They blew my expectations clear out of the water.

Card quality is not as good as I would hope.  One of the very few games that I have decided to sleeve.  Using Ultra Pro #82689 standard size (66mm x 91mm) clear Deck Protector Sleeves (the kind with the little hologram).  They are much higher quality than your standard penny sleeve and they fit great.

Legendary is a very fun and engaging game. The combos in the game are wonderful, though some of the artwork is a little lacking.

RATING: 6
An expensive version of Ascension with too much stuff thrown in.

Any amount of interest that the hero decks add is immediately removed by how stiff their requirements are, such as interacting with similar heroes. Ascension had just the right amount with it's Lifebound and Constructs, but this game forces it everywhere it can and it makes a lot of hands much less interesting than they could be. As well the different villains and end conditions really just don't add much.

The artwork, while nice, is just far too busy and makes everything hard to see - even the board you play on is too cluttered and it can often be hard to even tell if a card is in a spot.

Get Ascension instead. Unless you're really into the superhero theme, in which case: force yourself to stop caring about theme so much and just get Ascension instead.

RATING: 4
I believe competitive co-op is a fundamentally broken concept, and this certainly doesn't do anything to show me otherwise.  Beyond that, everything else feels like a watered down Ascension.  You have the option of playing it as a pure co-op, but then it's far too easy and doesn't offer much in the way of interesting choices either.

Probably not fair to judge it, we played a coop version which seemed to make half of the cards not make sense, it just didn't do anything for me.

This was awful. This game took forever to set up with far too many different decks to sort through and shuffle together. Every card looks the same as well, so with the crummy box insert it was really hard to even figure out how to set it up. Once the game started the recruitment pool quickly filled up with heroes no one could afford, so that every turn you just bought whatever card was availabe. Even though we had put in trashing cards there was no way to get rid of our starting cards, and our decks became a useless hodgepodge of whatever cards we could afford. I never felt like I was deckbuilding or making choices.

I thought I would give it another chance. Maybe it was just a bad set up. The 2nd time I played I bought 1 card the entire game. My hand kept getting discarded by the villain and the recruitment pool filled up with expensive cards immediately with no way to purge them. My deck started getting filled with some trash card the villian was handing out and very quickly became worse than it started. I literally bought 1 card the entire game. What an embarrassing piece of trash.

This is an excellent game, clearly my favorite deckbuilder, it's very well designed allowing for theme to emmerge from a very mechanical system. Excellent replayability thanks to endless expensions! costly though

[+] huge replayability with expensions, excellent mechanisms, great theme that shine through, short game once everyone knows, not recommended with 5p, most masterminds/schemes are on the easy side, but you can pretty much adjust the difficulty by mixing up multiple masterminds/schemes
[-] base game cards don't have different illustartions; need sleeves! expensive! quite long setup and tear down; hard to fit everything in the box :)

This game will always have different ways to lose depending on the scenario.  There are a couple of scenarios that really take away from the game (in particular the ones that greatly reduce the impact of villains escaping) but if you simply remove those from the game (and replace them with the many great expansion cards) you will love the game.

One play only, so hard to say, but there seems to be a lot of replayability value here with lots of different decks to choose from. On the other hand, the setup is quite time taking, because there are lots of decks to create and shuffle and using the same setup twice is not perhaps the best idea.

After the first play there seems to be a lot of text and lot of symbols, some of which are harder to read/understand, but probably gets easier with experience.

Our three player play (I was one of the two newbies) took hour and half, which is quite long for a game like this, but again probably takes less with experience. The setup time is quite time consuming still, I don't think that will change.

I can play this game in the future, but I have no special need. It feels like a good game, but hard to say at this point. Also, my Marvel knowledge is couple of movies and no comics at all, so I was not the target audience. I don't know about the theme, not pasted up, but not really shining either.

Based on two plays so far.  Deck building aspect works well but I was disappointed in the lack of super heroyness - it granted all deck builders are abstracted and the theme is very superficial, I just felt like there could have been more done, with some of the cars, like the bystanders and plot twists, especially.

The jury's still out on whether or not I'll like this as a multiplayer game (semi-cooperative is still cooperative, dang it), but I like the mechanisms of the game so far.  For one, they mesh with the theme better than the DC Comics deck-builder does, if only because players are all buying out of the same pool of heroes, instead of taking on the role of a hero and then taking on other heroes' superpowers.  It makes more sense for players to be working together as a team to take down the villains, even if they're all still trying to take down the most in one game.  In a way, players are basically managers of S.H.I.E.L.D. branches, each vying to get the best quarterly report from the main office.  

I'm interested in playing the game again, and playing with other opponents, just to see how it plays out.  As a solitaire game, it's OK, and as a deck-builder, I haven't delved into it deeply enough to know what sorts of tactics exist among all the mastermind, henchmen, villain, and hero combinations.  But it's intriguing so far.

UPDATE: I've played it with three players, and it's actually not a bad cooperative game.  The tension of the villain deck adds something to the game, and as I mentioned above, the game fits the superhero theme better than the DC Comics deck-builder did.  I also appreciate that it's semi-cooperative, so there's still a winner, but even if you lose, you can take some satisfaction from having defeated evil along the way.

One thing I find frustrating about the game so far is that it's difficult to thin your deck, which is a necessary tactic for most deck-builders.  It's too easy to wind up with a lot of dreck in your deck, and I wish there were more feasible ways to alleviate that issue.

I really enjoy the cooperative nature of this game. You have to work with the other players to win, but you are secretly trying to gain an edge on the other players. This game really captures the essence of Marvel superheroes in a fun tabletop way. I have always liked the idea of deck building games, but I hate it when they are collective card games. For me, CCGs always came off as pay to win games. This game gives all players an equal footing and still lets you build an awesome deck.

This is easily the better of the two superhero deckbuilders. It's sort of a competitive co-op, with players trying to assemble the best version of their own custom Avengers team to take on a Villain who is in turn trying to pull off some crazy scheme. Because of this, the game usually tells a great story of hostages, rescues, bank robberies and all sorts of cosmic emergencies. Every single game truly is unique.

The downside is that the level of customization creates an immense set-up/take down time commitment. Cards have to be sorted, shuffled, then resorted when you are done. It is truly a pain...but well worth it for the experience, I think.

Card quality is wanting, the fragility of the cards demands sleeves and at least in the base set, the game leans toward being too easy to defeat the villian. Thankfully, that was addressed in all of the expansion materials that have been released, so now it takes real cooperation to defeat the villain and real guile to beat the other players to that S.H.I.E.L.D promotion.

If you love comic books or comic book movies, you should grab this, ASAP.

What a mess. Played half of a game cut short due to time constraints, but I have no complaints about that. There are a lot of things I noticed in the half-play that made it difficult to look forward to a full session, mainly the ridiculous setup time and the slightly awkward "collecting actions rather than heroes" system.

Also, we played full co-op, ignoring the rules for an individual victory. "Partial co-op" is a ridiculous idea.

I can't quite put my finger on why I like Legendary so much. I know part of it is theme, but it's not like the theme is heavily integrated into the mechanics. Mechanically, it's pretty similar to Ascension in a lot of ways, but I hate Ascension. I guess the differences have a substantial effect on my enjoyment. In particular, feeling like you're struggling against a threat as well as opponents and the way there are separate tracks for things to buy and things to attack (as opposed to Ascension' shared area for both) make the game more enjoyable. 

My two complaints are that the theme often feels fairly pasted on and that it's typically pretty easy (at least in the base set), but it's a lot of fun for a deckbuilder.

RATING: 8
My favorite "pure" deck-building game. A little bit of that love may be owed to the theme and the bright and beautiful artwork that accompanies it. But you can't make me like a game just by slapping a bunch of spandex and energy blasts on it. No, the underlying game is a solid one, basically taking the formula of Ascension and improving upon it.

And those improvements really do make a difference here. Separating the enemies from the deck-building cards. Giving you an objective (Mastermind) to complete and special obstacles (Scheme Card) to overcome. Encouraging you to tailor the available card selection to create different combos or increase the challenge.

That's really what I find the most fun about Marvel Legendary: it's extreme flexibility. You can create all kinds of different scenarios by how you choose to mix and match the game's set-up.

The base game is pretty good on it's own and gives you plenty to work with but with even just one "big box" expansion (for my money, it's Dark City), you can really blow the lid off this game.

Surprisingly good. Very innovative considering the game is 1) and Upper Deck production and 2) a deck building game - based on established IP no less!

This actually captures "semi-cooperative" fairly well which is something I think many other games attempt and fail miserably at. The game certainly seems to have a small bit of balance issues (though I suppose a superhero game should be a fair bit swingy). I can't decide if I like that the art is repetitive for gameplay or if I'd rather have individual pieces of art for each card for a more immersive experience. 

Bottom line: Fun little game that plays quickly.

Coop deck builder set in the Universe of Super heroes and villains. Only we are the Shield agents trying to coordinate efforts to oppose the evil doings of Hydra.  Strange thing is that I'm not particularly fond of Dominion-like deck building or a big comic book fan yet this game is so enjoyable to play.

One very small nit pick is the user guide is black text on a blue background is a challenge in dim light and many of the card titles hard in any light. You remember the cards soon enough but gives me an eyestrain headache just thinking about it.

This game needs to be sleeved.  I don't usually bother but some of the cards that are used in every game setup (e.g. master strike, scheme twist, and agent cards) will show wear and become obvious on the draw decks.

Enjoying this a lot, lots of variety with Dark City and PTTR. Mostly played solo, but my wife likes it, too, so will occasionally play 2 player. Not sure I'll play it with more than that very often.

RATING: 8.2
So far I really like this and have played around 15 games of it.
I now have Dark City expansion and look forward to mixing things up a bit.
Essentially it's a deck builder where it's beneficial to get cards that compliment each other in terms of combos etc.

RATING: 8.5
Great mechanics.  Also plenty of replayability due to the various possible combinations of Heros and Villains.  It's a hybrid coop/competitive game where the players all fight the villains and mastermind invading the city, but players receive individual glory for taking down villains or the mastermind.  Great artwork as well, but it gets mostly lost/ignored during gameplay.  Slight issues/nitpicks are the small text on the cards, and the setup/teardown time.  Otherwise a solid, relatively short game that is somewhere between a filler and a hardcore gamer's game.

Marvel Legendary may or may not be a better design than Dominion, but it is a lot more fun.  Which means that it actually [i]is[/i] better than Dominion in the only way that counts.

I don't see any serious gamers jettisoning Dominion and rushing out to purchase Legendary, but there are 1001 families and comic fans that would rather have this box under the holiday tree than the Big D.

And if there's one thing that I've never been accused of, it's being serious.

[i]Lesson learned:[/i]

Having to set up the game from scratch every time is atrocious, and reason enough to avoid playing.  So I don't do that.  Instead, I always have a pre-constructed scenario ready to go (including all decks) for three players, which is our most common player count.  This means that we can get up and running in just a few minutes.

To keep things fresh, every three to four sessions I'll reset the game by rotating in new heroes and villains, a new scheme, or an entirely new expansion. Which there are millions of, at this point, and I've happily purchased every one.

I love Marvel Legendary. I already love the Marvel universe, even with the absurdity of it's retcons and relaunches. This game already has pretty much every major hero and villain in it with expansions coming down the pipe for the forseeable future. On top of all that it's a great deck builder. The hero decks are well balanced, the unique construction of the decks makes for a unique play experience every time and you'll never live long enough to try every combination available in this game if you lived to be a thousand years old.

5.5 after 2 plays

Deck building card games tend to end up rather multiple player solitaire and this game suffers from that too. Seems too expensive, probably due to licensing of comic characters.

Easy to pick up - took us about 15 mins to learn this game from scratch. The interactions can be interesting and the theme is great. The crazy combos you can play make you feel powerful and really get across the impact of a coordinated superhero attack. It became far too easy once we'd got the hang of the tactics but the Dark City expansion makes this game shine. After getting the expansion I've become a lot more interested in playing Legendary, it's harder and the amount of choice is massive, it feels more balanced too because we lose games sometimes now.

I came to Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game from the Legendary Encounters: Aliens, and Predator games. I can see how the latter titles evolved from Legendary, but I still enjoyed the heck out of the game. I'm a Marvel fan boy, so the theme is a big boost for me, but I really enjoyed the schemes, and henchmen, and everything else. My one point of critique is the rather poor artwork, they could have picked much more interesting art for the cards, and especially tried to use art which linked to the card itself. It seems like this has improved in some of the expansions.

This is my favorite game, and it has reached the table many, many times. It's just awesome. I've only played with 1, 2, and 3, but it went well with all sizes. You can drastically adjust difficulty for an easy experience or a diabolical one based on scheme, heroes, and mastermind.

I highly recommend picking up a few of the expansions. Dark City is probably the best, though Secret Wars Volume 1 and X-Men are also quite good. The new Civil War expansion is unnecessarily complicated and, frankly, underwhelming.

This one is alright. After playing Legendary Encounters though, this system has run its course in my mind. Regular Legendary isn't bad but there's not a ton of challenge here, nor a huge feeling of threat. If guys escape the city, oh well, no big deal. The escaped villains don't really DO too much all that often, so it turns into a ho-hum sort of experience without much tension, and more often then not, I've won when I played. It's just OK. I guess I can be thankful that this system turned into something a thousand times better in Encounters.

Might have been a 6 a year ago or a 7 two years ago, but this is such a generic deckbuilding game today.  All it really has going for it is theme.  Game play is really simple and dull.  You basically just lay out your cards and add up your recruitment and combat value.  If the cards have combos they pretty much trigger by themselves.  There's just little opportunity to be very creative in how you play your hand to maximize your battles and recruiting.  Making it even duller was that it was not even very challenging to win cooperatively.  The whole theme of villains moving across the city and heroes in the HQ seemed really tacked on.

This game is awesome, and I can't wait to play with other heroes we haven't used yet, and the other schemes and villains. I cannot see how adding expansions into this can be detrimental. I want more of it. I need more of it.

My only gripe is pre-game setup. I don't mean every game, I mean the first one. Open the box and sort every card, in order to be able to take the cards you need and shuffle them back up. It didn't really take long, but it felt like a chore that would never end.

Also, setting up the villain deck took three shuffles. Once for all the villain types, a second when we realized it needed bystanders and scheme cards, and a third when we realized it also needed master strikes.

Objectively，i think the game has relatively strong theme ，nice and suitable artwork with actually no innovation（just the base game since I havent played the game with any expansion yet because this series is hard to get china）
Personally,i really dont enjoy play even i am a big fan of marvel,the set up is long compare to the gaming time and another main factor is that i most of my game is deck building game and they are almost the same: Thunderstone Advanced ,Dominion,DC Comic The Deck Building Game（Except Nightfall）， some shufflebuilding game such as Smash Up and Epic PvP and also Unfair which has a random central deck and central roll stuff as those deck building game，so they have the similar taste and i am tired of this . However the variety of the cards contained in the base game do increase the replayability of the game and the combo of the cards is also need to think about，the order of playing cards and other little stuff.
Overall,if i only have this deck building game i will pretty much enjoy every games of it, but as i mentioned early i have too many deck building games with the same taste and this one is kind of like the mix of Thunderstone and DC（although they have difference of course）but certainly i will choose this one instead of DC because of the replayability and the complexity.So i give it a 6.5.

I love the marvel universe.  I've only played a few games of this, so it's a little new to me. I have yet to play a game where I feel it's really "hard."  Each play thus far as been pretty easy.  My knock on the game thus far really has to be the text on the cards is WAY too small. The character should be smaller and the text bigger.

This is another one of my favorite games. Being a thirteen year old girl (sorry about the 1988 on my profile, it just won't let thirteen year olds sign up), I am a huge marvel and DC person. So as soon as I saw this in my local game store, I knew I had to have it. I brought it home and absolutely fell in love with the game. I love the scheme twist idea of the game, and not only that, but the expansions and expansion cards are so cool. They make it an even better game with even more depth. I loved the game so much, when I go to GenCon this year with my dad, I'm cosplaying as the version of black widow that they have on the cards in the game.

The gameplay is fun (with some hits and some misses), but the theme is really enjoyable.  For the cost of the game, the components are subpar, as the cards are too thin and the dividers -- oh, don't get me started on the damn dividers.  (Has Upper Deck simply not been paying attention to the deck-building market?  All deck-builders have individual dividers, and plenty of them, with more introduced in each expansion, unlike Legendary.)  Also, where are the randomizer cards?  

Despite those big complaints, the game is rather fun.  It's not the best deck-builder, but it's far from the worst.  I just wish someone other than Upper Deck had published it.

Probably my second favorite deckbuilding game, right after Ascension (and then, I'd say it only loses out due to higher set-up time).

Very thematic and I love the semi-coop aspect (once you get used to the different characters and know how to optimize your deck, you start being aggressive towards other players right from the get-go :P ).

RATING: 8
I really enjoy the random dungeon deck.  Not knowing when to quit, I actually got a whole crew through every encounter in the deck.  I did require a few miracle straights, and I used quit a few of the treasures, but I finally emerged with 10 treasure cards and three extra experience points.  Unfortunately, I cannot recall the exact makeup of this incredible crew.  Barbarian, Ranger, Cleric and Wizard, I think, but I think the Bard is a fantastic addition to a crew with the Wizard.

Pretty sweet one page game.  Impressed by how thematic it feels for such a simple concept and implementation: when telling about a game afterwards I never say "and then I rolled a bunch of sixes and ones" I say "And then my wizard fireballed all the skeletons at once!!"

RATING: 7.5
Simple and neat little dungeon crawler, that sometimes puts you in a tight spot when choosing which dice to re-roll. I like that it's a one-page adventure, that it plays fast and that there are some nice twists in the heroes' powers. And yes, it can become addictive. I'm working on my own adventures for the game, also. Quite fun to do!

RATING: 7
For a dungeon crawler dice game, this is surprisingly thematic -- the fighter and rogue are in the front hacking away while the wizard and cleric shoot the occasional (and powerful) spell. All you need is a few d6 and a printout of the PDF so go get it and give it a try. Very addictive.

6/18/10  Just ordered 3 decks of cards from @Artscow with their latest sale. 2 prototypes and Delve the Dice Game just to have a nice copy.

11/2/10  Acted as the DM for my 5-year-old son playing Delve the Dice Game. He lost his cleric, but defeated the dragon!

1/22/11  DM'd Delve for my 5yo's. One son defeated the dragon, but in Sands of Time, the 2nd son allowed the space-time continuum to unravel. Oops.

This is a fun little print and play dice game.  There is a bit of planning before you set out (in terms of your party) and then away you go, re-rolling dice up to twice before pulling die combos out to activate special abilities.  In part given all the iOS plays, I am getting a bit bored of this - but that's after over 40 plays, pretty good replayability for a little print and play!  You can make your own classes and challenges so you could keep it fresh and of an appropriate difficulty level.

iOS: I had a lot of fun with this although I'm getting a bit bored of it now... but I've logged over 40 plays thus far so that is pretty good replayability for a little game.  Cute changes in facial expression and comments from the characters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I own the standard (i.e. not the advanced, card driven) version of the game.
The art is beautiful, and the adventures seems fairly balanced.
There is obviously this gameplay issue with the cleric that more or less enables you to almost fully heal your adventuring party at the end of each fight... but it is nevertheless an interesting.

I am now working on the so-called advanced version of the game. I just need to laminate the cards. But they look already awesome ! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is a pretty clever system, but I don't find it a lot of fun. When I'm losing it's not like I can try harder or put in more thought - the dice do what you need or not, and there's not much you can do. For that reason I find it unrewarding, and I rate it fairly lowly.

Also, as far as I can tell the rules that you should use are not the rules that come with the game...

This is a fun, simple little timewaster.  Even though I only gave it a 6, it is actually a fun game for a few minutes.  It is pretty simple, and the strategy wears thin after a few plays.  It can be played in about 10-15 minutes once you have familiarized yourself with the rules, and it takes up very little space if you keep score on a little notepad.  Given the cost and time,  almost everybody can give this one a shot.  It's well worth the time to print it out and plays it.  Any time I am waiting for something and I have a handful of dice, i just roll up a game and see if I win.

This PnP game is a nice diversion if you have 10 minutes and want to roll a bunch of dice. There isn't much depth and it's almost purely tactical, but still I like it for what it is. It's a kind of game I will never long to play, but if I am tired and want a quick activity it's great.

I have played the original dungeon three times and the Sand of time adventure twice.

Fun little game. You roll dice and try to get straights, 4 of a kind, 5 of a kind, etc, to attack the monsters. Then they roll to hit you, hitting on a 5, 6, etc. It all varies with the monsters you're fighting and the heroes in the scenario. All you need to do is print out the one-sheet scenario and grab 6D6 and you're ready to roll.

I've seen this in the past, but was never really into solo games. However, I was traveling solo for work this week and needed a gaming fix. Needed a P&P that I could print out easily at work. Delve certainly fit the bill and I was able to unwind and have a bit of adventure on my trip.

Also, I didn't have any dice with me. But I knew there were a bunch of die rolling apps out there. I downloaded a few free ones, but many were RPG focused, or didn't allow 'saving' dice in between rolls. I finally found one that worked perfectly: "The Game Dice Roller" by Ifelse Media Ltd. I have no affiliation with them, I just searched and found their app, and it did what I needed.

Made a bunch of these in the perfect size for my tablet... can play it using a die roller app on my phone. Addicted. Love the decisions each turn in how you're going to fight. Produces a narrative on how a fight goes... My only wish is that the adventures weren't linear somehow and that there was a sense of advancement. But that's stuff that isn't really what this game is about... 

So what is this game about then? Quick fun with a nice narrative :)

This is as easy as a print and play can get - six dice, one page of rules, and one sheet of paper for the basic game. There is not a lot of complexity, but it does what it sets out to do very well, providing a nice diversion with a few interesting decisions. It's not an all-the-time game, but it is fun.

This solo dice game with a Yahtzee-like core mechanism has several things going for it: a clean, simple idea, modularity, and the presentation of the first couple of official scenarios. Unfortunately, healing as featured in those scenarios doesn't work: it's broken when exploited and mostly ineffective otherwise. Further, there seems to be a lack of scenarios that are free of ambiguous, cryptic or poorly considered mechanisms, and even the rules, for all their shortness, could be improved. The game concept has potential. The application is not there yet, but if the designer were to present an overhaul of the "base set" I would be happy to test it.

First of all, it's cool that this game can be played pretty much anywhere with very little in terms of components. However, this basically Yahtzee game's positives end there. Besides being very luck-based in terms of getting the rolls you want, I hate that the enemies have the potential to do more damage the more health they have, making the difficulty of each encounter vary from being incredibly easy to incredibly difficult. Also, I dislike the thematic discord in that if an encounter has its monsters really weakened, you should just let it continue to whack at you while you roll to heal up your party before continuing on.

This was a near-ideal solo lunch break game from the choices so far.
https://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/195930/solo-lunch-break-games

It plays in about 15 minutes, and each run-through tells a little story. It's fairly difficult: I've played each of the five scenarios, and only beat the Original Mission (where the Cleric pulled out a Miracle in the next to last room, as the sole surviving character with 1 hit point remaining) and the Fey Forest (where the Ranger is perhaps OP). Which gives some cause to replay these. Rating: 6

This is a great game to take with you when you travel, a great game for kids and immersive enough for adult solo play from time to time. Great game and it all fits ins pocket!

One play is obviously not enough to form much of an opinion about anything, but I don't think I will play this again. It felt a little bit too simple, and a bit too much like: roll the dice and see what happens, rather than: roll the dice and try to come up with something interesting. On the plus side it is incredibly easy to make, and doesn't take up much space. I understand why some people enjoy it, but it is just not my kind of game.

Great "press your luck" solitaire game. Lucky enough to complete the first scenario on the first go with a Divine Blessing drawn from the chest, a Chain Lightning blast from the Wizard, and Cleric's Miracle when facing the Dragon.

The second scenario, "Sands of Time" took eight runs before completing. Drawing the Jeweled Scimitar with some timely Crippling Strikes finished off the Sphinxes (losing the Wizard) and closed the Time Tap (just barely).

Completed the "Tomb of the Pharoah" in one run with only the Minotaurs and Hydra offering any real challange. The Labarinth and Hydra mechanics set this scenario apart from the first two.

I liked the idea in theory.  In practice, I spend a lot of time rolling dice and looking for 1's and 6's -- not enough time making calculated risks based on the situation.  The skills you might aim for given context require too much luck to try for, so you are back in the classic yahtzee situation of succeeding mostly based on your initial rolls not based on your reroll choices.

Also, there is a degenerate strategy against swarms of small weak monsters where you can whittle them down, then milk them for healing spells.  Just don't accidentally kill them too quickly.

It's a clever little system, and easy to print and fun play to play a few times.

I can't imagine playing very many times (except maybe occasionally), especially given the easy cheesy but invaluable trick to get your health healed at the end of a fight vs an almost defeated adversary, so you're at full strength for the next encounter.

But if you are into this kind of dungeon crawl + push your luck more than I am, you might enjoy it a lot.

Pretty cool PnP dice workout.  It's like going to Vegas in a dungeon.  I found myself saying out loud "C'mon cleric, baby needs a resurrect!".  Short, sweet and serves it's purpose.

(PNP) Delve is a pretty fun time killer waiting for your friends to show up or if you've got 15 minutes to kill. I'd only ever play solo. there's a small bit of strategy, but the dice do most of the deciding for you. The first two dungeons (original and sands of time) are the best, the new dungeons/characters are fun, but the balance is off I think (or I just got lucky)

Decent fan activity, but I'd love to see the designer jump back into the mix and take the game to the next level. New dungeons, for example.
It's just so darn portable and simple! I love rolling dice but not so many dice as something like Qwarriors, etcetera.
Good about the game: Fast fix.
Not good about the game: Needs more quest sheets (variety).

7 after 1 play will have to see how long this holds up or if it can even excel beyond that. Nice little game with tension and decision making to be made. Yep it's got the yahtzee thing going on but so what...basically every dice game out there does. I like it so far.

Not sure why this game isn't rated higher.  Very good (and free) push your luck game, perfect for playing while camping, just laminate the print out and use dry erase markers.  I think this is much better than Yahtzee, the dungeon crawl theme is what pulled me in.

This is a clever solitaire design, with the randomness of the dice to simulate combat effects, but with some decisions you can make along the way.  It seems like the game is strictly tactical, with each encounter having a particular approach that should be attempted each time.  It reminds me a little of Decathlon that way, though the adventures seem more interesting than a track and field event.  Some of the healing benefits seem a little too powerful, and wild swings of the dice will make the game insanely easy, or ridiculously hard.  For a 10-minute, nearly free solitaire game, though, you can't really go wrong with this one.

2 plays: 1 player (beginning adventure)
3 plays: 1 player (Sands of Time)
2 plays: 1 player (Tomb of the Pharaoh)

Fun game, but I wish it involved the element of picking a gang of adventurers of various skills to master the delve in best fashion. Now it is merely a game of odds, and becomes a bit too simple IMO.

Tried it out a few times and it is fairly interesting.  Not a lot of long-term strategy, but it goes quick, so that isn't really a problem.  I like that there are multiple adventures to play and multiple characters, but I'm not sure if it is something that will have a whole lot of appeal after repeated play.  I'll have to see.

Rating is for the advanced game.  I played the basic game to get a feel for it, but likely won't play anything but advanced random dungeons again.  I would like to see some "expansions" for this to keep it fresh.  The dice mechanic works fairly well in Delve: TDG and provides some interesting push your luck decision making.  It is a fun little solo game.

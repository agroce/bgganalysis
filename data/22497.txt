Straw is one of that large family of games in which cards are played until a magic total is reached and then the player left unable to add a card suffers some penalty.  In Straw the loser doesn't score while everyone else scores the value of cards left in their hands.  That scoring system creates some tension between holding low and negative value cards to get out of trouble and keeping high numbers to boost your score.  There is absolutely nothing else to distinguish this game.

Not very good card game, but playable. The straw card is pointless card since there is basically no way other players will play you to exactly to 50 points...

RATING: 6
I'm going to hold off rating this for now, as we just played a 2-player game that felt pointless.  I think we need 4-5 at the table to make this one work.

Update: Much more fun with 5 than 2. :)  Played today with the whole family and it was fun, but a little random, just like UNO.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
(KIDS) Simple counting game with similarities to Zeus on the Loose.  This is about 20 times better than Zeus on the Loose. There are many more meaningful decisions and the special cards and how the scoring works can put you in a tough,  but manageable spot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Not a bad kids filler which teaches addition and subtraction of numbers 1-10 up to 50. Way too chaotic and driven by the luck of the cards for gamers.

When we played as a bunch of gamers this was recognised very quickly. The emergent strategy was to get rid of all low value cards (hence the early totals were well into double digit negative), pack your hand with high cards and maybe keep one card such as a reverse to get you out of trouble. Then hope somebody else went out.

A really simple take on Uno.  There are very few choices in this one, but it can be fun to play as a quick filler.  One that does work with the family, and can be taught really quickly.

A rather simple little parlor game that is good for mixed couples and is rather quick and fun though not a real game to remember. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Play cards featuring objects of different weights on the camel card in the center of the play area. Try not to make the total weight of the pile go over fifty lbs, or you'll pay the penalty of not scoring any points at the end of the round. Special cards allow you to reverse turn order, wish for an object of any weight, subtract weight from the camel's back, etc. Some decent strategy can usually circumvent luck of the draw. Toss your Uno deck and play this instead.

RATING: 6.5
Not too bad of a game. I thought there was a little more strategy to this game, over Nox, but everyone else felt that nox was the better game. You have 3 cards of various "Weights", and you put one of these weights on the camels back, declare the new weight and move to the next person. The person that breaks the camels back, by putting more than 50 units of weight on it's back gets zero points, with everyone else getting the value of the cards still in hand. UNLESS the weight is exactly 50 and you play the straw card (this is the only time it can be played) and you get the points, with everyone else getting zero. This made for a fun experience. Dad and I even managed to use the straw cards. In the end Heather won though. Playing it safe can work, and having a whole lot of luck. Still excellent.

I had occasion to try out this simple game when a friend decided to buy it for his non-gamer family for holiday play.  I was unimpressed; there really isn't anything different going on here from any other family card game, like Uno or Mille Bornes.  So, I guess I don't recommend this one, even for the non-gamer crowd... why not try out Settlers on them?

RATING: 6
Simple filler that provides some decent math practice for kids (a'la Zeus on the Loose, Cowabunga).  My initial games were 2-player, which doesn't seem optimal for this game, but it was enjoyable enough.  After reading through the forum posts, I'm interested in the suggestion of one user that the straw can be played at any time, allowing any future player to win if they are able to hit exactly 50 (well, 50 and 1/1000th) during that round.  May have to try this next time.

Aug08: Not a bad little card game. It's got some push your luck elements. You want to hold high cards at the end of the round, but they are the same cards that are likely to make you bust.

Still, it usually just came down to who drew the most cards to keep themselves from being the player to bust. Could be good to teach kids to add and subtract.

It's like an old traditional card game I used to play as a kid that we called 100, though this game has custom-printed special cards, rather than assigning effects to different face cards.

I really like this game but I have to say I think it doesn't quite have the scoring where it should be.  I realize it's just a 'quick filler' but it feels like the cards should either be tighter (1-5 points with a 25lb camel, instead of 1-10) or the game should play longer, like to 100-200 points.  Bottom line though:  this is a fun game.

This is definitional filler. It's an escalation game, adding cards to the pile and adding the number on your card to the total. If you're forced to send it over 50, you lose and everyone else scores the points in your hand. So you want to keep a safe card in case you're next and the total is 50 or close, but otherwise you want as high as cards as you can get to score well. An interesting balancing act, and the early play is trying to get your hand into that situation. After that, it's a bit of a lottery on whether you get struck or not, as everyone's trying to do the same. It's easy to pick up and fast to play and easy to have some fun with. Mostly harmless.

A simple, fast, cheap card game I really enjoy.  Almost new-Japanese style in simplicity (although it uses a full deck), with some interesting Uno-type cards thrown in, and some (dare I say it?) bluffing and manipulation that makes it an excellent little package.  Recommended!

RATING: 5
An OK filler, but as light as the titular straw that broke the camel's back. After a round the strategy seemed pretty obvious, and it just came down to the draw of the cards.

RATING: 5
Not bad as a light card game.  I really enjoy the balance of not wanting to hold too many high cards or low cards.  A larger hand-size would alleviate some of the problems of the luck of the draw, but might also make the decisions less interesting, and potentially the game longer.

But if your family wants to play Uno or something similar, this is a much more interesting and fun alternative with clever mechanics and good decision making.

Clever, if sligtly overlong, card game. Nice risk pay off - keep all your high cards or make sure you have a safety valve to avoid breaking the camel's back? We played with five, which is a few rounds too many. Probably prefer this with less players.

RATING: 5
Brain-less filler. The concept is good in theory but there's not enough Straws to actually make it dangerous to leave the camel at 50.

RATING: 5
adds some choice to classic break-the-limit card games -- high cards are risky to hold but worth points if you are not the one to break the limit.  So, there is more than just rote play, even though luck is a big factor.  Larger hands make the game a bit more strategic.

Very enjoyable. Gameplay kind of like Bucket King stripped down, with very nice card art; conveniently portable, surprised there's not more love on the geek. 
Edit : since buying, have to say I am really disappointed by the cheap matte cardstock. Feels like it would disintegrate after a few plays. Perhaps one reason there's not more love on the Geek.

This is a great little filler game.  It might be light, but it's FUN.  It's a good game to play with friends, family, non-gamers, and kids since the game concept is straightforward and thematic, it can be taught quickly, and it's easy to understand and play. It's just a deck of cards, so it's very portable and routinely travels in my game bag and sometimes the glove compartment of my car!

It's a cute little game where you play a card then draw a card. You're putting the cards, of varying weights (number), onto the camel's back while trying to avoid breaking its back (i.e., having the sum exceed 50). It has cards of negative value, and Reverses (like Uno), and one Straw (special card, playable if sum is exactly 50). When someone busts, everyone ELSE scores points (= sum of values) for cards remaining in their hands. So you want to hold onto big cards to score big, but you also need the small cards to be able to play without busting. So it's got a little more going for it than Uno, but ultimately feels a lot like Uno anyway!

Really simple game, this is based on the idiom "the straw that broke the camel's back".  Players take turns playing a card from their hand and drawing a new one in turn until you put more weight on the camel than he can handle and break his back.  At which point every player beside the one who placed the card that broke his back will score points based on the numbers remaining in their hands (with the exception being if you broke the camel's back with the singleton straw card, then you and only you score).

The strategy in this game is so singular and obvious.  You play the lowest value cards in your hand (or the special cards that give negative or no points if left in your hand at the end of the round) and hope to get lucky enough that you don't get stuck having to play the last card.  That way you have the most points in your hand at the end of a round.

Very, very boring.  I wouldn't even recommend this as a game for kids or non-gamers.  It doesn't challenge or teach anything, it is not engaging at all.

A quick filler trying to pack a camel with goods without going over the weight limit. A neat twist in that your hand when the camel's back is broken is how many points you get, so you want to hold on to high cards, but if you only have high cards, you're more at risk of breaking the camel's back. Of course, if you break the camel's back with the titular Straw, you are the only one that scores that round.

This game is a bit too simple for adults to play because there's not a lot of strategy but I think it would work okay for kids as a great math exercise.

Otherwise, there are no decisions in this game at all.

A very light and quick card game brought to you by Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG), who may be better known for recently publishing The Adventurers, Thunderstone, Infinite City, and Tomb. You're dealt a random hand of cards depicting items of varying weights (like a flying carpet or Aladdin's lamp), and you take turns adding a card to the camel's back, trying not to be the one who pushes the total weight over 50 (i.e., don't be the one who plays the straw that breaks the camel's back). There are some other cards that reverse the order of play, subtract weight, copy a previous item, and other such things. It's fairly random, but quick enough to not unbearably wear out its welcome. Not my first choice of card game filler though, since it comes in behind all of the following: For Sale, Fairy Tale, Bull in a China Shop, Scripts & Scribes, No Thanks, and Coloretto.

A fast paced game that requires a 4th grade education (or at least you can do simple math in your head, which I suck at...) Anyways, you can race to "break the camel's back" and make everyone else loose points (like shooting the moon) or strategically play cards to squeak by and not loose any points.  Great for the whole family, especially kids learning math.  Awesome artwork as well!

Rated as a fun light filler or family game. We've played this with both casual and serious player groups, and so far everyone we've played with has had fun. Nice combination of simple game play, a little back and forth, a little take that and cute graphics and theme. Would probably be a fun game for reinforcing addition and subtraction skills with children.

Quick game of pushing your luck and messing with your opponents (Reverse, reverse, reverse). Though with a few players it seems a bit too quick and one may have no chance to caught up. There is an unofficial variant to play to reach a set number of points, which may alleviate this issue. Still a nice quick filler.

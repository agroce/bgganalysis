Awesome game with a lot of depth and replay value thanks to the mini expansion tiles and the random starting configuration.

The game builds on very abstract strategy games such as chess, go, and checkers but goes towards a much lighter direction thanks to the "forced march" rule that allows a player to do a second action, usually if they have several units killed by the enemy.

This makes the game a bit more unpredictable, especially with >2 players but that means you need to rely more on general strategical planning and smart "area capture" by building.

I really like games that are a bit chaotic, unpredictable at times but still let players with good strategy win.

2 Player is fairly interesting, feels like a modern day chess. Pressure the enemy king, take enemy pawns with tempo. 3-4 player is not good because there is too much kingmaking, every turn involves the decision of who to screw over. Also, we've arrived at the conclusion that victory points don't matter at all, it's all about elimination, not sure if that was the intended design.

Had only one 2 player game but so far I'm pretty impressed. It's nice little thinky abstract war game. I bought it mainly for the 3 player game though. 

With three I just hope the bash the leader and king-making aren't huge problems. I suspect with 4 players this game will have too much chaos, bash the leader and king-making for my tastes.

Depending on the 3 player game this could rise to an 8.

Fantastic abstract strategy game with enormous depth.  The game starts out pretty simple but gets more and more intriguing as you play and realize the ramifications of your potential actions.  

I want to give this game a 10 but i have to -1 for the colors of the player pieces.  There's blue and dark blue and white and off white.  The player army pieces (round) all have a symbol on them so its not a huge deal but the buildings don't.  Telling the difference between the white and off-white buildings makes me finally truly understand what its like to play a board game and be color blind.  I will probably be using a sharpy to mark the off-white buildings.

Gran bel Gioco Astratto da 4 giocatori che funziona in modo eccellente sia in 3 che in 4. Eko è un gioco dalle fantastiche illustrazioni, dove bisogna calcolare molte cose prima di agire, molto tattico e esteriormente favoloso. Grande gioco da provare assolutamente.

RATING: 6.5
Simple mechanics mask the highly tactical nature of the game somewhat. The abstract component mixes nicely with the building/laying waste to structures, and occupying particular features. I really like the addition of a few variant tile sections within the core box, to really boost replayability. And makes this a game really worth trying out. Nice concept, beautiful art, fun gameplay - everything one could hope for in a title!

Brilliant abstract strategy game! Still unearthing all the extra expansions/variants for play. Can be cutthroat and might be a bit too chaotic at 4 players, but usually a highlight when it hits the table. Beautiful artwork and component quality—a definite hidden gem.

RATING: N/A
First impression (4 players): Does this game ever end, or have incentive to? It would seem that, just like the backstory tells us, the players are doomed to a pointless, dreary and nigh-endless war of attrition which at some point is won by a hapless player. If at that point his or her mind is still intact, I salute him or her with that achievement. It's just too damn difficult to build up any kind of position: there is no concept of distance so you can't hide in a corner, there is mandatory reinforcement so you cannot go nuclear either, there is kamikaze attack, ... . The game probably works better at 2, but really, with TZAAR and DVONN at your disposal, why would you?

I play 3 times the prototype during a tournament.
I think this is a very good for 2 players and just a good with 3 or 4. 
With 3 or 4 players it is very difficult to defend your emperor (witch is 3 victory points) especially with the "force march action", so the end game is very chaotic.
You spend a lot of time to construct small 1VP or 2VP towers and next to this you cannot defend correctly your 3VP Emperor.
With 2 players I think is a real good "chess like" game.

Very enjoyable abstract with some surprising elements in the mix. I received it as a gift and thought it was some sort of Manga space checkers at first, then realised it was almost like a wargame with area control-ish mechanics. It has an interesting increasing tempo as the game progresses. Initial turns see players staking out their positions and freeing up space on the board as they build up their stacks. This increases freedom of movement and requires players to establish defensive positions, as powerful stacks can sweep across an open board in a single move. The mandatory reinforcement rule forces stacks to grow taller and taller until they dominate everything or fall to a single kamikaze piece, and the game as a whole has that sense of an inevitable crescendo, picking up speed and destructive power as it goes, until one player crushes the opposition or collapses in on themselves trying to do so.

Wow! This is the most underrated game I have ever played. It is a mix of Tzaar, Taluva and Attika plus several original ideas ( I especially like the kamikadze rule). It` relatively short, simple and very intriguing. It is my favorite abstract game for more that two players along with Taluva and Torres. And it is so beautiful!

A very neat multiplayer abstract game with a great balance between building up your empire and tearing down everyone else's, as well as trying to find the right balance between combining your armies to make them stronger, but still keeping enough armies on the board to keep them useful. Very interesting (and one of the nicest looking abstracts I've seen in a long time).

Nice modern abstract game. I don't know why, but this feels less abstract to me than other games of this kind, even though there isn't much theme on the board.

It doesn't matter much though, as the game is very interesting with alot of options and choices to take, while the rules are on the lighter side (like a good abstract should be!). I will definitely keep an eye on this one and will most probably add it to my collection at some point.

Played once with 3 players.
Didn't really like it because it seems to chaotic.
The game invites to think hard and feels like chess.
Except it seems impossible to have safe positioning for anyone so you are open to whoever the opponent decides to attack making it feel chaotic.
Forced March is a cool mechanic and adds more strategy, it adds unpredictability but is less chaotic as it requires investment.
You can mitigate losses in the chaos and evacuate emperor but it doesn't feel like you have a working strategy.
From what I saw the game is probably much better at 2 players.

Astrattone che di più non si può con grafica molto discutibile. Il gioco non attira, però devo ammettere che non si tratta di un gioco banale. Necessita di strategia e l'interazione è bella violenta. In sostanza mi sono ritrovato un gioco ingiustamente passato sotto traccia a mio avviso a causa di una grafica triste e del fatto che non spicca per originalità. Mi sento comunque di consigliare il gioco che alla fine risulta soddisfacente per la durata contenuta che richiede.

Played at SPIEL 2015. Visually, this game is a peace of art. Rules are elegantly simple; game play is purely tactical and very confrontational. Though I'm personally not a fan of purely tactical games (I don't play chess ;-)), I can recommend it wholeheartedly to fans of the tactical genre. 

Works very well with any count of players from 2-4, but best with 2 or 3 players. Downtime probably depends on players' ability to plan ahead.

Eko is an abstract that I got some enjoyment out of playing, but I don't really like or want to play again. I don't like the way that an opponent can take a move that opens a route to your emperor for another player's emperor to take advantage of. I also dislike how structures can go back and forth without really progressing the game.

interesting abstract strategy game with an odd but convincing theme

+ theme and mechanics
+ good materials and cool artworks, symbols and building pieces
+ modular board and included variants (I like that!)
- thin cardboard for player boards
- odd name
- should contain a bag for random setup
- ads on the (inside) box


I'm not quite sure yet how good the game really plays.
It's quite rough (captured generals, prevented reinforcements). I wonder if it is possible to come back from a weak position. It would be sad if the first mistake decides the whole game.

It's interesting that casualties aren't the direct measure for success, but rather long term limiting of reinforcements. ?

An abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players. We played with 2 and in that setup it becomes extremely strategic. There are a lot of different moves in the beginning and I didn't see immediately what kind of strategy I could possibly pursue to win the game. There are two victory conditions: last man standing or victory points. Victory points are awarded for building houses, or towers or the castle or capturing opposing emperors.
 
Building happens on special building sites that can accommodate up to level 1 (houses), level 2 (towers) or level 3 (palace) buildings. You have to move through a series of upgrades and spend playing pieces on it.
 
Player pieces are eliminated from the board by attacking opposing stacks. Max stack size is 4. You need to be taller to beat a stack. To beat a stack with the special emperor piece you need to be 2 taller. So the emperor is best protected in a large stack. But beware the Kamikaze move. A 4-stack can be removed by a single piece that is itself removed from the game.
 
After each move a player can re-introduce as many as three pieces all placed on a single stack. Or he can sacrifice three pieces (remove completely from the game) to gain another turn.
 
Towards the end of the game the many small stacks coalesce into a few bigger stacks. Because while pieces can be re-introduced on top of other stacks, it is very hard to make smaller stacks (by building) and it is impossible to start new stacks. Houses block neighboring enemy pieces from receiving upgrades.
 
I knew I had lost when I lost my last few single stacks. That was the point where the opponent stopped being afraid of Kamikazes, upgraded to size 4 stacks, captured my emperor and proceeded to sweep me off the board. And I am not sure my opponent really knew what he was doing either. 
 
The game is well done, the play mechanism smooth, the art pretty, and yet I floundered through it all, so despite no randomness in the mechanics the result felt random to me. Abstract games tend to sit in our game stack forever and no matter how good they are they do not get played. If you really like abstract board games give it a try.

RATING: 8
This is a great abstract strategy game, with plenty to ponder, yet still potentially very quick turns. According to our play stats, it's about 15 minutes per player. The modular board setup is very robust: Choke points matter, but are not completely game defining, so while a dense setup of the tiles is guaranteed to work, you really can lay it out randomly, as long as all the movement spaces form a contiguous group. The variability of the modular layout coupled with the random setup (honestly, we randomly set up the map, too) does wonders for the replayability and addiction factor. Additionally, your options on your turn create a sufficiently dynamic environment that even with a static map and a fixed setup, I think there would still be a good game here.

[b]2p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b]
[b]3p[/b] [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b] I was shocked to see that it really does work great with 3. Yes, 2 people can gang up on the other, but the only really viable collusion strategy is eliminating the target from the game. Then, it's just a 2-player game, and neither of the schemers can afford to let the other get the upper hand while bashing on player 3. The balance of the game's mechanisms does wonders to make this work multi-player. The true limiting factor is that the number of stacks you have in play can only decrease (or hold steady), so an alliance to erode a player can be effective, but that player quickly gains access to double-turns (via [i]forced march[/i]) as a result. OK, I admit that I was the outcast player, and I managed to squeak out a win by points (and capital-control) with a single disc left on the board, at the very last opportunity. :D

Fun little game that I would pull out in the same times when Diamant is appropriate.  Would also be good as a gambling game.

I don't see it what's fun about this game. Even for a fun game it's too random. You don't have even the feeling something is under controll.

This is a pretty fun games, especially for younger boys.  (Poop meeples, how can they not like that!). Good for family gaming.

A filler that wants to look like a light game, Kalimambo can be fun with the right group (I guess the one I’ve played it with isn’t suited). I’m still unimpressed though: and its art doesn’t help make it any better. [i](June 2012)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - Five years later, I’ve been playing Kalimambo again and to my surprise I’ve enjoyed it a lot more than I did at first: however, its success depends heavily on the group you’re playing it with, anyone taking it too much seriously is going to spoil the game for everyone.
It’s just a little heavier than Get Bit (still just a little bit!) but at the same time it doesn’t reward wicked plays as much as the latter either: still fun though.
Hence, in October 2017 I’ve raised my rating from 5 to 7.

Completely random chaotic fun, with poop.

RATING: 4
Kalimambo feels a lot like 6 Nimmt or something similar, where all players secretly play a card.  The cards are then flipped and carried out.  Sometimes, you guess correctly, and sometimes you guess poorly and get completely hosed over.

I feel like there is the ability to make good plays in this game in some situations, but very often it's a complete crapshoot, especially when played with a large group where a very large amount of table randomness is introduced.

Overall, it's a really cute theme and idea, but really isn't much fun to play.

Completely random action selection game, a genre of it's own. The game is devoid of any strategy, but offers some chaotic fun. Has some charm to it, but is graphically uninspired.

2013-12-24 : Stupîdly fun game - totally random, but who cares when you can crack jokes about stepping in manure and getting rammed by a rhino in the back
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Silly fun for the whole family. I once was playing well, until I decided to set up a trap and play a 0 while directly in front of Rhino. The next turn, I played my 1, but since Kali got struck over no less than 9 fields and my 1 was the lowest card played, I received this huge penalty myself. If you set a trap for someone else... ;o)

So far, all who I played this with, had a fun time and immediately requested a second game, and another one, ... Though in essence it's always the same, the game (with 4 players) is over in 20 minutes, so you can quickly have a payback game.

So far, I've always combined playing Kalimambo & King of Tokyo. The non-gamers rather prefer this over King of Tokyo, but for me it's the other way around. Both games are excellent to play with a bunch of 4, 5 or 6 lightly experienced players though.

Great family/party game! Plays best with many players. It's fun to try and figure out which card to play so that you don't walk into elephant poo or get poked in the butt by the rhino behind you. But most of the time it turns out differently than you thought anyway.

Great light filler. This plays pretty much like 6 Nimmt/Category 5/Slide 5, but with a nice board and components and an amusing theme. Like 6 Nimmt, the game might seem random, but I enjoy trying (albeit usually failing) to gain an advantage by outguessing my opponents. I think this would be great with kids.

RATING: 7
Not many games give you the thrills of avoiding rhinos and poop!  Kalimambo is possibly the most chaotic and random game I've ever played and yet I enjoy it greatly.  There's just something about the art, the components and the extreme silliness that makes it awesome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An enjoyable game. I like the theme and the speed at which the game plays. Still, it is awfully random and you have to just go with the flow, being willing to get hosed for no reason other than a random card play. The only willful act that we have done is the old "hold back and play your zero so that it hurts even more next time" play. It's pretty fun, even when it happens to you.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Thematically cool game that is structurally a trick taking game. At the same time you're often trying to avoid being in the end of the line because you don't want to be hit by rhino, but you neither want to go to the front as that would mean stepping on the poop. Enough serious planning for adults and probably a lot of fun for kids.

A game about shitting animals - what a great idea! It felt pretty random and luck dependant though but I guess I won't play it ever again. So it doesn't matter.

Ein Spiel mit Sch**** ;).
Jeder Spieler hat identische Handkarten von 0…9 auf der Hand. In einer Runde wählen alle Spieler gleichzeitig eine Karte und legen sie verdeckt ab. Sobald alle gewählt haben wird aufgedeckt. Wer die höchste Karte hat setzt sich auf dem Spielbrett an die vorderste Stelle aller Figuren, dann folgt der zweithöchste Wert etc. Eine Nichtspieler Figur ist dabei, aus deren Kartenhand eine zufällige Karte gezogen wird.
Wer auf den auf den Feldern zufällig verteilten Misthaufen tritt erhält Minuspunkte, sowie derjenige, der am Rundenende noch ganz hinten in der Reihe steht.
Zwei Sonderregeln machen das ganze nicht ganz durchrechenbar, denn wenn mehrere Spieler die gleiche Zahl spielen, zieht nur der Letzte unter ihnen, die anderen bleiben stehen und wenn der Nichtspieler Kali Punkte kassiert, erhalten diese diejenigen Spieler mit der kleinsten, also vermeindlich besten Kartenwert, diese Minuspunkte.
Das Spiel ist an für sich sehr zufällig, man kann schon seinen Zug steuern, aber der Zufall wird groß geschrieben. Dennoch mag ich das Spiel, es ist so witzig jemand anderen in die Kacke laufen zu lassen nur um dann festzustellen, dass auf dem darauffolgenden Feld noch ein haufen liegt, in den ich treten muss!
Das Spiel ist auch sehr schnell vorbei, so dass der Zufall ganz gut passt.

It's a bunch of silliness but that's what the situation calls for sometimes. I'm sure there is an advantageous selection of the cards you play in this game but I'm not seeing it. We laughed quite a bit about it so it doesn't really matter.

Very easy to play children's game, but not one that children could easily play without 'supervision' to enforce the tiebreaker and Kali/Mambo rules. There is a strategy here if you want to attempt it, but will be only as good as your guess lines up with 2-6 other player's cards, meaning much chaos. Twelve turns long means the game ends not too long after someone gets rammed for 7+ points and is effectively out of the running. Unique and interesting.

A good game actually, but basically a re-implementation of 6 nimmt. There's a board and a theme here that 6 nimmt is missing. It's too bad the board and theme are tacky. 6 nimmt is more compact, plays more characters, and is more appealing when brought to table. The game isn't entirely fair since the person in front of the rhino can play the 1 card on the first turn and guarantee to hurt someone, while perhaps running a perfect game after that. Not a big deal, but enough that I'll always choose 6 nimmt.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Even though the amount of actual control might be low, especially with the full number of players, the card choice always feels like it matters. The movement phase is surprising every time, and no one really cares about the end scores, since the fun is in the process instead of the final results.

Nice bits, as you'd expect from Zoch.

On the board you find a track going in rounds. On some places there is poop. All players travel behind eachother in group accompanied by a rhinoceros and a bear.

Players each play simultaneously a card numbered 0 to 11. Then the players, with the highest numbers first step out of the group and move to the front of the group. But if there are multiple players playing the same number then only the player who is furthest back moves. When you step into the poop you get penalty points.
The row is always closed by a rhinoceros and when he suddenly notices that nobody is directly in front of him, he is going to run! And because a rhino has bad sight, he does not slow down in time. So a player will get a rhino in the back, resulting in penalty points.

The more players you have, the more fun playing this game is. The game contains some beautiful figures! Tip if you have a good table occupied.

With the cutesy animal theme and the poop meeples, the game is obviously meant for children. It's vaguely reminiscent of 6 nimmt! but without the semblance of strategy.

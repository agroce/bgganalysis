RATING: 6
As much as I love all things apocalyptic, I think this version is a step down from the regular version of Munchkin.  The toughness of the bad guys makes it so that you need to work together to make much progress, but somehow that just seems to make you less inclined to help other people.  Maybe the point is you are supposed to be milling around aimlessly until the world comes to an end, and while that may be a clever high concept, it diminishes the fun of actually playing the game a bit.

Ugh really?  I am waiting for Munchkin Flux so I can Die the most painful death imaginable!!!

Otherwise known as Munchkin:  Make a bunch of crappy expansions, good for exactly one laugh in a game that should be ten minutes expanded into untold hours of torture wishing that you had the +2 rapier of suicide so you could kill yourself an get it over with all ready!

Said Game will make Steve Jackson Games a bazillion Munchkin Gold pieces off of a really boring, looong, and repetitive game, sold to gamers too brain dead from playing this stupid game to know better than to buy more crappy expansions with the same jokes rehashed over and over and over.

Very much a shift in the traditional Munchkin dynamic, requiring co-operation, along with the new Seals mecahnics that introduce variable win conditions, make this sequel so much more than a lazy re-themed cash-in. More changes of this depth will keep the line going strong.

It's Munchkin.  If you don't know Munchkin by now, pick up any one of them, prepare to hate all of your close friends, and have some fun betraying each other.  Out of all of the munchkin variants, this might be my favorite thanks to the seal mechanic adding another wrinkle to the usual formula.

RATING: 7
Munchkin was one of my favorite games a decade ago.  It doesn't hold up as well now for me but this set is a fun take on it that I would much rather play than the original.

I will say the addition of the Seals brings this one to the top of the versions of Munchkin that I would be willing to play.  They are another way to force the end of a game so it doesn't drag out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Adds some nice elements to the original Munchkin, and actually adds a whole new way of playing Munchkin, where you don't have to focus as much on getting levels, but more on acquiring items, as long as you make an effort towards opening the seals.

Munchkin, need I say more? Oh, apparently I do lol. Just a good fun game to be played cooperatively or nefariously as you so choose, only this time there is a "countdown" mechanic that will end the game before it goes too obscenely long.

RATING: 8.5
The most fun munchkin i've played in terms of both humor and gameplay. In fairness, this is my favorite theme to begin with, but the jokes here are generally funnier even then. Even better, the Seals add a whole new element that makes the game actually feel apocalyptic. There's a real tension to the game, even with only two players, that isn't always there in other versions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not really liking the Seal mechanism which is why it gets 7.5. Without the seals , it gets an 8. The seals just add more upkeeping, players always have to look at the cards and see their effect and many times over the course of the game they are forgotten. In the end, the Seals did not provide additional fun, but players prefer this new theme to the original munchkin game.

[ES] Hace tiempo me dejo de gustar el munchkin. Las partidas son excesivamente largas para un filler y pasados los primeros niveles, la mitad de los monstruos son sumamente faciles de matar si por mala suerte nadie saca mejoras de monstruo. El Apocalipsis es para mi el mejor de los juegos base porque intenta solucionar estos fallos.  Los sellos, la novedad en este juego, ayudan a que el tiempo de partida se vea notablemente reducido (todavía no he jugado una partida en la que alguien llegue a nivel 10) y aporta una forma para que los monstruos no sean demasiado fáciles a la medida que los jugadores se van equipando

[EN]I stopped enjoying munchkin a long time ago. The game is excessively long  for a game that feels like it should be a filler and, after a few rounds, half of the monsters are pushovers without the help of monster improvement cards. Apocalype is my favorite munchkin base set because  it tries to solve these issues. Seals, the new mechanic in this base set, reduces playtime significantly (i have yet to see a game end because someone got to level 10)while also providing a possibility for all the monsters to scale with the number of rounds

More stupid fun, this time at the End of the World!  

The seal mechanic provides some interesting twists:

•  An immediate effect upon opening,
•  An ongoing global effect, and
•  An alternate game end and win condition.  

If you're loaded with gear and prepped for the End of Days then you want to open as many seals as possible and end the world; if you're less well prepared or close to a Level 10 win you want to prevent the opening of and/or close seals.  This makes for a ridiculous tug-of-war across a thanatropically chimeric landscape of various sci-fi threats, eco-disaster, nuclear armageddon & religious prophecy.

Nuclear Holocaust! Government Cover-up!  Zombie Virus!  Something's going to get us, but what will it be?  All the fun of an Apocalypse RPG without the role-playing.  Of course, role-playing is the primary point of RPGs.  On the other hand, I do think this game is a fun diversion to quickly defeat evil, gather loot, and build a character, all with fun pokes at RPG and Apocalypse culture.

RATING: 3
For a good part Munchkin feels like an activity more than a game: you help each other defeat monsters, you trade class-specific equipment, and it's largely immaterial whether you're one level ahead or behind because of the take-that and catch-up elements. Then you get to the point where one or more players can win, priorities change, resources are expended to prevent anyone from crossing the finish line and then the game is won by whoever's next in line when those resources are depleted. (Apocalypse can also be ended by a pseudo-clock, whereupon equipment and not level is used as a tie-breaker; this doesn't seem much less anticlimactic.) For a competitively minded player this sort of arc in itself is a fairly substantial downside, to which must be added a large potential for rules arguments out of the box and a miscellanea of niggles. Some of the puns and visuals are charming but they cannot carry the game.

You know a game is bad when, on the first turn, the person teaching the game says "Whoops, we automatically lose when that card appears on the first turn - let's just throw it away". Goofy art and jokes aside, the game seemed both broken and unfun.

Read my comments for Munchkin or The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin because they apply here too.  But I have to say, I find my personal experience greatly improved by Seals.  They can help you or (more often) hurt you, and they add a little bit of scary anti-player randomness that makes the game a little tougher and a whole lot funnier.  It can also act as a a catch-up mechanic by toppling the lead players, which is does often, but be warned that it does occasionally just kick the losing players really hard in the face instead.

RATING: 4
Nice theme, but Munchkin can sometimes take forever and feel tedious. The alleged 90-minute playtime is bullshit. Sometimes it can take 90 minutes, sometimes you hit the two, two-and-a-half hour mark and everyone is bored and you just say "OK nobody wins, can we do ANYTHING ELSE now?"

It's better than normal Munchkin however because it adds a new end-game condition.

I always wish you could turn Munchkin into a 30-minute game with the same playstyle (maybe just go to level 5 or 6 instead of level 10?). It'd make it a lot more enticing to play.

I have seen the Fast Play rules on their website, but haven't tried them yet.

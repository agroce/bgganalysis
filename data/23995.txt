RATING: 9
Played furiously in the year 2012. The more we played the more We liked!! Beautiful components and cards. The Key of the game resides in siege operations and not in battles. The France of Louis XIV have the manpower and a central position but the allies have Malbourough. Twice I had the pleasure of conquering Lisbon with a Bourbon army commanded by Berwick! A simple and elegant game in the line of Hannibal and Washington's War.

One session around 3 hours.

RATING: 10
Wonderful game. I had some concerns on play balance, but the 2 games I played ended in Alliances victories, so I was pleasantly surprised. Very nice map and counters. The game models nicely XVIII century warfare, with long sieges and battles with uncertain (but sometimes deadly) results. The theater of war across all Europe permits wide movements of the armies, so that it is never boring.

Juego sencillo sobre la Guerra de la Sucesión  España. Entretenido y bonito. No todo es atacar. Muchas veces es mejor reservarse. Tiene esas sutilezas que lo termina convirtiendo en un juego al que vas a volver por lo que tiene de profundo en lo sencillo.

A very fun and elegant game that plays quickly and smoothly; it is quite enjoyable for solitaire play.  See my AAR and mini-review in the forum for more details.  My only significant concern is that it feels imbalanced in favor of the Bourbons, but that is mostly outweighed by its many virtues.

Wargame sencillo que no está mal para pasar un rato agradable, pero que tiene algunos aspectos que lo lastran para obtener una mejor valoración.

En contra:

- Demasiado azar. Los combates y asedios son una absoluta lotería, si los dados no son tus amigos ese día date por muerto. El otro jugador obtendrá PV por derrotarte en batalla y te costará muchos recursos recuperar tu ejército.

- Los eventos son simples y no demasiado inmersivos. Las cartas de activación son ágiles pero sosas. Me gustan más los CDGs tradicionales.

- La campaña es tal vez demasiado larga para lo que ofrece el juego. Tengo dudas también sobre la rejugabilidad pq las estrategias son un poco obvias.

- Hay demasiada aleatoriedad también en el robo de eventos (hay eventos beneficiosos de movimiento y combate que le pueden tocar una y otra vez al mismo jugador) e igualmente pasa con las cartas de activación. El monomazo no ayuda precisamente a mitigar el factor suerte, ya de por sí bastante acentuado.

- Las condiciones de final de partida son un poco raras y hay que tenerlas bien claras antes de jugar.

A favor:

- El juego es ágil y dinámico. Fluye muy bien en la mesa.

- Trata un conflicto muy poco plasmado en los juegos de mesa. Eso hace el juego interesante a priori.

- La ayuda de juego es muy completa y útil.

- Como wargame ligero es un producto bastante aceptable, con el chrome justo para el novato.

- El manual de reglas está muy bien escrito. No tiene apenas ambigüedades.

RATING: 8
After a couple of plays I really enjoy this game. the system is reminiscent of Napoleonic Wars but with less flukey luck. Both games I played were tense and competitive and came down to bold moves on the final turn.

Does a decent job of portraying period warfare for a game of this scale and abstraction.

RATING: 5.5
Provisional rating.

Pretty tight, love the rules, the play aids, no issues at all, very clean, focused.

I dislike the "bucket of dice" mechanism but it may be well suited for the period. Results can be wild and extreme.

It is not a true CDG in the classic sense. Only 2 events per turn, no trade-offs between events and operations. This makes the game a bit drab, battle outcomes are pretty much outside of the player's control (which is debatable) but I wish there were more room to influence them (combat cards?).

Otherwise pretty good, balance seems good and there are a lot of options for each player.

Will play again.

(Final rating)
Played again. Meh. Not sure anymore the options are *that* numerous. It felt too much like crapshoot with many outcomes depending on plain luck. I find this game too frustrating for my tastes. Not that deep after all.

The more one learns about the War of the Spanish Succession, the more one begins to see that the Allies are too strong in this game.  A true political component is needed.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I playtested this some before it came out, but didn't pull the trigger on buying until recently, mainly due to the art choices (below). 

So, when you're doing a grand strat CDG, you face the fundamental Depth/Speed choice -- go with a lighter treatment Cruiser, or a deeper, heavier Battlecruiser or Battleship.  Don and team went for Cruiser, and are highly successful.  

I love the blessed simplicity and speed of the system; I average about 30-40 minutes a yearly turn, and they flow very quickly, with few references to rules or tables.  I enjoy the multi-front action and choices; do the Allies push in Flanders, push or hold in Germany, Italy and Spain?  Lots of potential strategies for both sides, and good offense/defense assymetry.  My early opinion jibes with others that the Bourbons may be favored, but we'll see.  I think a few more pre-1708 battle cards, that conferred early Allied advantages, or imposed single battle French screw-up penalties (penalize 1-2 dice, or similar) could have helped here. The since spawned Variant/Optional rules are an attempt to address this, but still don't do enough. 

As an aside to those complaining about the game being all sieges -- get a grip,  and pick up a book -- the war was 80% sieges!  The fact that I can play a game covering 11-12 years of 80% sieges and enjoy it so much is a huge testament to how well the designer captured the essential aspects of the war, and how well these have been boiled down into Big Bones/Bare Bones mechanics that impart the strategic spirit but avoid mechanical drudgery.  Well done!  

I'd give it a 9 overall, but the graphics bring it down a half notch.  I know they were going for an antiqued, stylized look, but it comes off more as cartoony; I feel connotations of a "Liberty Kids" cartoon when I look at map and counters.  This, and some missed playability opportunities -- the reinforcement listing could have been laid beside each year in the Year track, and the Siege table (yes, used often!) needed to be somewhere on map, in one of several large open spaces -- will be constant minor irritants each time it's played.  The counters suffer the same fate, with, for me, -- PET PEEVE COLOR SENSE ALERT -- an added minus of the absolutely viscerally disturbing "puke pink" background chosen for all the Allied units and markers.  Uggh.  I mean, DOUBLE ugh!  Why didn't they go with Brit red, Dutch orange, or Aus white?  Triple ugh!

Is this the definitive Spanish Succession strat game?  No.  I hope there's someone designing a Battlecruiser depth game on the era out there; that's the one that will be considered the "classic."  But right now, NPWS is the ONLY SS strat game worth playing, and kudos to the design team for clearly rising above the pack of nondescript failures that have come prior to this.  Until that chimerical, perfect Battlecruiser game comes along, this Cruiser will scratch the SS itch nicely.

Special rules caused some grief, The limited options caused some analysis paralysis. Both should improve with more play.

I am getting some resistance from opponents on the rules which seem to be causing comprehension problems. So far we've had one dramatic end, and two refusals at the first jump.

I tried this with a much more experienced opponent and we had a very good two turns, but this is a game that is going to take a long time to finish. Every activation was carefully judged and play was very tight indeed.

Fast (4-5 hours with auto win, 6-8 hours full game), medium complexity game about war of the Spanish Succession. Four different theaters of war, sieges, battles, maneuvers. I like it. 
One thing that lowers my rating it is too much "luck dependant" factor in this game. It is especially important to the Alliance side.

RATING: 6
One more play in, this time an Alliance victory, largely due to some lopsided die rolling and specific events. So, it can be done, but then it's probably the dice and/or cards that beat you, not your opponent.

So, after 3 games, I sorta feel like I've already seen pretty much everything there is to see. It's just not that deep of a game. Sean Chick's leader variants (or something like them) would help a bit, but I think it goes deeper than that. That doesn't mean it's bad, it just means that I'm ready to move on.

---------

Ok, after another play where I barely hung on as the Bourbons, I think I have to give this game a bit more credit than my original rating afforded. My opponent showed me some new tricks that you can use to flummox the Bourbons. Also, don't be like me and sent Marlborough to Spain like a dummy.

That said, the Alliance still has a tough row to hoe, and the Low Countries will likely be a quagmire for a long stretch of the game. You'll have to be patient, and be in position to take advantage of the Spanish rebellion when it happens. Taking out the Bavarians with Eugene as soon as possible is probably a wise idea, too.

Overall it's decent, but my rating is dampened somewhat because of how much hinges on Madrid and the Spanish rebellion, the significance of certain events (e.g. French Financial Collapse can have huge long term consequences, or not, depending on if and when it's drawn), the somewhat scripted nature of the opening moves (hint: attack Cadiz on your first move Alliance player), and the rather large Q&A that has resulted from a rulebook that could use some love. Also, if Marlborough dies, you may as well pack it up there and then (or just house rule a 12 to an 11 when it's Marlborough).

But, it's a keeper for now.

-------

Angry rant after one bad play below. Will try it again before giving up on it.

-------

A game of sieges. And more sieges. And yet more sieges. As the Allies, better hope you get the ops. And some crucial events early. And a better hand than your opponent on most turns. And some decent die rolling for all those sieges.

If all of those things don't line up for you as the Allies, well, sucks to be you. If Marlborough should happen to die early, you may as well pack it in right then and there. As the Bourbons, you can mostly just sit back playing defense, perhaps with a surgical strike here and there to wreck the Allies' plans. So long as your luck is even average, the game should be yours.

This is yet another game developed by Neil Randall with dubious victory conditions and balance. To wit, there have been several optional rules proposed by fans to balance the game.

But beyond the play balance issues, I just found the overall game play tedious and uninteresting. If one player is relying almost exclusively on events to make progress, it's not a good game.

2016-03-23 : Played the variant/add-on "9 Years War" prototype which is more or less a prequel to the base game. Very streamlined game with none of those complicated little niggly rules that only come up once in a blue moon, letting you concentrate on your strategy. As I know a fair bit about the history and warfare of the period I was pretty impressed with how this game almost naturally forces the players into the decision making process of the historical commanders.

I think it is not really as easy as many claim. Lots of chrome and lots of little details in the rules which are easy to be missed. I wouldn't play this with a newbie.
Feels really strategic (unless many CDG, where you just act according to the hand of events you happen to get), because you need to do plan over several years and stick to that plan patiently. If you try to do too many things at once, you might end up empty-handed at the end of the year.
Very well suited for PBEM with very little interaction in combat and only very few "opportunity" event cards.

Strategic, War of Spanish Succession, 17th century. 

Card Driven but most of cards are just about operation points, not events. 

Not fiddly at all but features a lot of elements to bring some chrome, although very simplified (sometimes they're based on a dice roll). 

Campaign seems not too long to play. Map and cards are gorgeous.

Hard to say why, but I just didn't like it. You all have had dates like that. Reckon I want a little more flavor, but I confess I don't know how the designer would be able to get it on one map (hexes?). I wasn't enchanted with the "half" corps mechanics. It was just a lot of little things adding up to an unpleasant experience for me.

Am working through my first game PBEM, and am favorably impressed with the high-altitude strategic take on this period.  Nice artwork, with the unusual portraiture of the leader pieces.  Moves fast, and is very siege-heavy.  Haven't got the strategy down yet, but it's a lot of fun.

Card-wise, they split off ops from events, with an event to lead it off.  Makes for little less fretting over whether to play an event or ops.  However, the number of activations on the ops cards vary, and will force tough choices about what to do where, and the kind of tempo you can maintain.  Not as chromy as HIS/VG, but seems to work well.

RATING: 8.6
Update: Tried last weekend with real shark friend of mine. His thought was that the ability of the brits to easily ship troops to spain (1 move) and the french having to react (many moves - only can move 2 or 3 spaces a phase - and Spain a LONG way from the front) doesn't feel right. Basically, the brits can "flood the zone", french have to over compensate. Brits then redeploy back to main front if needed - or stay in Spain tying up a disproportionate number of french forces. I think he is correct. But, we still had fun and enjoy the game and I haven't lowered my rating. The lust factor is still very high on this game: 38 wanting the game for everyone that wished to trade it - a very good sign.

Update: Heard from some of my shark friends that they played it at OBXcon last week; a very tough crowd and they gave NPWS the thumbs up. So, continues to look like a gem.

-------------------------

Highly recommend this one: see my quick review in the review forum. 

Only reason I didn't rank higher is that I like big honkin chromed up beasts; No Peace is an elegant game, with a minimal amount of chrome, that still offers us grognards PLENTY of choices and decisions. For those preferring a low to mid complex game, with campaign game playable in under 4 hours, on a great subject, this is your game; sort of a cross between NAP Wars (that basic combat engine - with a great twist - demoralization) and Wilderness Wars. 

Designer and developer did a GREAT job.

First couple of plays. Simple rules, clear and simple components, but far being from a simple game. We played twice in a row with the same sides and the two games could hardly have been more different. Yes, there is a chance factor that enables this, but it never feels as though you are a hostage to fortune - I particularly like the fact that there are so few event cards in the deck, so there will be no nasty surprises.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A decent game on a very under-gamed and somewhat difficult subject, particularly at this scale; this is not really an operational gunpowder era game: it’s strategic in scope. Tackling this subject alone at this level is noteworthy and I think designer did a good job in simplifying some things to make it playable. The cards and box art are solid, and the map is functional, but the material is a bit thin on the counters, For a good overview/review of the game see Sean Chick (Formerly Paul O'Sullivan) (gittes) review of the game here on BGG, along with the comments that follow.

This is a FANTASTIC game. It's been a while since I've played a CDG and when it was over, wanted to set it up and have another go right away! In my first playing of the game, I wasn't terribly impressed. I liked the simplicity but was unsure of the depth of the game. In game #2, the depth started to come out. This is a REALLY, REALLY good game! Don Herndon and Compass Games hit it out of the park with this one.

I just played it once until now, and...I'm not convinced. It might be better if I play it more, maybe.
But this time, my wife and I , we just didn't feel the period when playing it. I'd say, lack of chrome. I'd have preferred if the game was a classic card driven than to have actions card and event card separated. 
It is not at all a complex game, and it has the best player aids I ever found in a wargame. Components are not bad but for me there's really a lack of chrome.

Rating based on 2 players.

Despite the BGG weight describing this as light, this game feels pretty heavy as it has a lot of rules and detail, even though the majority of gameplay itself is straightforward. It does seem to give a good sense of the war and siege warfare, and knowing absolutely nothing about the War of the Spanish Succession beforehand I'd have to say I learned a lot about it. However, the gameplay is a bit too detailed for my liking, with lots of easily-forgotten historically-based exceptional rules, and the emphasis on sieges is not really to my taste as I prefer wargames with high maneuverability. So, not really my type of game, but it was a worthwhile experience and I'm happy to have played it.

A simple and good game on the War of the Spanish Succession.

The rules are fairly simple and manage to recreate the characteristics of the era with an emphasis on maneuvers and sieges.

During the campaign, the Action cards allow you to do 1-3 actions (no event associated). You have to plan carefully your actions as there are several fronts (Spain, Netherlands, Italy, Bavaria, Empire, France, ...).

This is not a CDG but there is also an Event deck and each turn (year), 2 events are drawn. They provide some historical context.

Though I prefer games with a lot of historical events/elements, this is a really interesting game with a lot of tension and options.

I simply love this game!
May be the game counters are "simple" if we talk about graphics, but I think the game system is adequate to reflect the problems the real armies had in the period. Also an easy system for the battles, permitting reinforcements and sieges, that eliminates any unrealistic "blitzkrieg" attempt.
And I love also the game theme...

One of my favourite games. I was impressed with the box contents, good rule set, great player aid, nice card set. Only but is the map, feel it could be better looking. The game is very accessible to play at first sight, but be warned that it more complex in game play, meaning is very rewarding in the choices one needs to make during play, very strategic. The end result is a very engaging game. 

Nice mechanics with the Fortresses, Sieges and Fortification lines, all simple in the rules. The game is a bit asymmetric,  and with a limited hand of cards, it takes good planning to win the game.

RATING: 7
I am interested in this period of history and did a lot of playtesting for this game. This took some wind out of its sails when it finally came out as I has already played it so much, but its a straightforward enough game. I found it biased towards the Franco-Spanish Bourbons as they only need to avoid defeat to win whereas the Alliance needs to invade - besieging a long list of fortresses one by one. I found a successful strategy in sending Berwick and decent support to Spain, where the conquest of Portugal and Catalonia can really wrap things up for the Bourbons.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Looking forward to a more detailed game depicting this conflict--something a bit more Clash of Monarchs with more leaders, spaces, troop types, diplomacy, events.

This is more like a Columbia block game, but with more satisfying simulation value thanks to the generally mild but interesting events. You really get a feel for the essence of the conflict here and the headaches all this besieging must have caused Marlborough, Eugene, & Co. 

This game seems pretty balanced--you have to take either take 1:1 risks or charge in before advantages disintegrate, which can be almost instantly, especially if you do not draw enough event points. It can be a slog; this war was a slog; you have to seize advantages quickly or lose them for what seems like an age.

Somewhat blurry counter art.

I think I learned a lot about the War of the Spanish Succession, but was left wanting more. Solid, but a near miss?

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First play, we only made it to 1709.  Nothing particularly new or outstanding in the mechanics, but there are some subtle twists that help provide some period atmosphere.  Units are reduced easily, but harder to thoroughly destroy; this, the demoralization rule, and the need to lay proper groundwork for sieges determine a stately historical pace of play.

My main concern at this point is that balance seems to favor the Bourbons even this early; however an Allied concentration on attrition and some helpful events goes a long way to mitigate things.

[b]UPDATE:[/b] I think the game far underestimates the importance of command, with leaders too little effect on large battles. Not sure how I would change it, though, given the historical battles results were very bloody all around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Great game with decent components. Battle resolution bit simple (buckets of dice) but works well within system giving rise to lots caution/risk decisions. Card deck generates some nice touches without dominating the game. Highly replayable (despite being bit unbalanced towards Bourbons) Added bonus is its high suitability for Vassal play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Great handling of a war that's tough to simulate accurately in a game...and still have a fun game! The Famous Victory mechanic gives the great leaders a chance to capture several cities, which is normally tough to do because of all the fortresses to besiege. Perhaps a slight edge to the Bourbons (which is historical), but a very tense situation for both sides.

Pseudo-card driven game about the Spanish Succession. Buckets of dice, but heavily mitigated by two-step infantry, auto-withdrawal from "keys" and fortified lines. 

The game really captures the feel from the period (as far as it confirms the idea I have of the period through my reading of Chandler, Townshend Wilson and others.

RATING: 9
Simple and elegant design.
Perfect balance between complexity, playability, historicity and chrome. 
Very fluid and tense game. 

You spend your time thinking strategy, initiative and calculated risks, the very few charts becoming seconde nature after one session.

Highly recommended.

Unbalanced (most times the Bourbon win) but the game play is very pleasant, and gives a good period feel. A bit scripted at the beginning, but lots of strategies possible after. Rules are clear and simple, but offer real depth.

Received my pre-ordered copy after waiting a year. Looks pretty good. Rules are good. Easy to play. Played out two full games solitaire so far. Fun. Does capture quite a bit of the flavor of the period. It's very quick and light, but does provide an overview of the whole WSS.

Un wargame que gana enteros con cada partida que juego. Con algunas incoherencias históricas de bulto, como que el Reino de Aragón no se subleve contra Felipe V (como sucedió históricamente).
Con mi amigo José Luis, estamos preparando unas reglas adicionales que, sin salirse de lo históricamente verosímil, den más protagonismo al teatro español. Espero poder subirlas en breve a la BGG.

Very tense game.

Each point is important and every stack is important.
Since everything is so important, the playing time tends to be longer than I expected before the play.

I think the play of allied looks very difficult.

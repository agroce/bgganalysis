Fun but, despite the rules being relatively short, it's nearly impossible to teach. You really have to play it twice for anyone to be able to play properly for a full game, and after a single game they won't want to play it a second time, so...not ideal for random audience meetups. Best to keep it for solo play in a regular gaming group.

A design that perfectly draws the line between abstract and thematic game. It is also a nice game to play, although I'd expect a little bit more from the drafting mechanic.

I really want to play this multi-player.  I've played 3 solo games and really enjoyed it.  Even without having other players trying to screw you, this is a very tough game.  I can't wait to see what adding more players will be like.

Components -- the game is small, the boards are laminated paper that warps a little and the cubes have a tendency to get knocked around (or maybe it's just me).  I hope they create a more consumer-oriented edition with a bigger board and pieces.  Still, the components are "good enough" and I'll have no issue keeping this version of the game.

RATING: 6
I've now played the game once with three and twice alone. I like the general concept of the game and second edition has very cool lego pieces which also help the building part of the game. Game is complex and there's definitely lot of variety in the game.

Biggest downside of the game is that it's very though to teach so that players will get it right the first time they play the game. 3D buildings make it sometimes very hard to interpret the board and mistakes are unavoidable. It's dull to play 30 minutes and several turns and learn that moves you've made have been illegal.

Waiting for more plays and definitely going to play solitaire to learn the rules better.

I purchased Town Center as part of a Kickstarter that was looking to replace money that was stolen from a publisher during Gencon. It was a feel good purchase so I wasn't expecting much from the game and I wasn't disappointed... The games worth playing, but probably not owning. It's not as bad as the rulebook makes it seem so my suggestion is to struggle through the rulebook and give it a shot.

In Town Center, players are drafting cubes in order to create a city that provides income and scores points.  The various cubes represent different buildings, and the buildings combo with each other in different ways.  So, you're hoping to get the cubes you need, cleverly placing them in such a way that they score as best as possible for you.

A bit of a puzzly feeling game, and the structure of the game is fairly neat.  

The problem is I just didn't find the game to be all that fun.  It just felt too abstract in nature for me without anything there that was all that exciting.  So, good game design, but lacking in that "fun factor" for me.

A curious study in spatial conditional probability mapped against over-powering right-left binding and a rotating start-player.

The first mover advantage (first start player) is concerning.  I'm not convinced it is a problem, but I'm even less convinced that it isn't a problem.  The specific concern is that the players early in the turn order can (effectively) guarantee that they get a red cube on their last turn in order to force a well-scoring merger.

After over 10 games it is still fun and there are lot of things to discover and optimize.

I'm keen to try the next titles of the triology. :)

RATING: 5
Components: Nice city maps. Plain chunky cubes that don't do much for the theme. Unclear iconography.

Experience: Not for me. Too little foresight. Too little theme. Too unclear how cubes/groups of cubes are powered. Seems odd that we can buy elevators and power, but are left to the whim of chance whether we ever get a residential or commercial building. Because of the way they expand through development, they confer an advantage to the player who happens to get them out first.

To be fair, we didn't finish the game and we got a rule wrong (we will play again and if the rating changes I will adjust).  But as I understand it now, there is just something clearly wrong about the game.  We couldn't figure out why the offices cost five dollars to buy when they seemed like the worst building in the game.  All they do is possibly allow you to grown apartment buildings, but even then they can only do that a little.  And there aren't many of them in the starting bag compared to the greens.  Just something odd.

After 1 play:
a challenging abstract that has one of the coolest city building mechanisms out there. Red (government? hospitals?) grow residential, residential grows commercial...the parking lots, power and elevator mechanisms are ok. But the connections between the other three districts is something i wish more designers looking to make city building games would study.

The game itself is a nice puzzle with some decent player interaction in terms of setting up the offering.

I very much enjoyed my first play of Town Center, more so than its initial 7 rating might indicate. Why is that? There are two reasons why I believe that future plays won't be quite as enjoyable (and, in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the rating dropped significantly).

Firstly, the game is actually more of a spatial puzzle. The cube draft as the only interactive element is significant but not very compelling on its own. Secondly, the fun is in figuring out how to arrange your building parts in the best possible way. You could easily do that without even playing the game. Once the workings of the engine are clear the cube draft is the only source of uncertainty and, to reiterate that point, it's not very exciting on its own.

I suspect that once you have figured out even a theoretical ideal building layout the game will become stale fairly quickly. I might be wrong, though.

2nd Edition with Lego pieces
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Finally, a Lego game that's enjoyable. Beyond the childish appearance of playing with Lego, there's a brainburner of an abstract game here that still can be played in a reasonable time. Various interdependencies between the differenct coloured cubes which represent apartments, shops, office buildings, power supply and parking lots have to be considered. The aim is to build and develop large, high apartments which generate VPs at game end while maintaining a steady influx of cash specially through large shops. The only variance comes from the blind draws of two Lego pieces per player per round. It's calculation heavy and needs a game to grasp the mechanism. My only gripe with the game is the impression that in a three player game, the player in the middle position can be screwed easily if there's an unbalanced cube distribution.

RATING: 4
Rated only as a solo game. In this capacity I fear the game falls into a trap similar to that of micropul: high scoring becomes a function of draw sequences allowing you to mirror a known optimal pattern. Before I looked at Mester Tolvaj's solution I was struggling with scores in the 30-50 range; after I immediately broke 100. Much as I wanted to like the game, I don't really see this as depriving myself of hours of exploratory fun so much as cutting to whichever chase.

The game is also quite fiddly: even after several games I'm miscounting shop income, missing developments and having to take back moves. I'm not sure you can hold this against the game, but you can imagine what will happen with casual gamers. Tip: use a third marker to track income.

I'm hoping the multiplayer game with the cube draft will force choices with regard to city layouts that are much different from the solo game.

[i]This is a home made version.[/i]

[u]08-Feb-2013[/u]: This is a fantastic little 3D puzzle game that I made from extra cubes I purchased and my own player board I printed out.  I have mostly played this one solitaire but can see the potential with the standard, muliplayer rules.

Each player has their own board where they will build their town.  Different colored cubes represent different types of buildings - apartments, stores, etc.  You not only build horizontally on your town grid but also vertically.  Scoring is based on how many cubes of one type are connected to each other as well as how high they reach.

I love the puzzle aspect of this game as you must figure out not only how to create an interlocking townscape, but also how to build it both vertically and horizontally.  It's most certainly and abstract game, but the way the different buildings interact is quite thematic.  It's a solid game that is part of a series of self published (but now, fully published, I believe) games with a city building theme.  Check them out.  Very cool stuff.

I haven't had such a bad reaction to a game in a long time. The options players have are determined totally randomly. Then the start player can freeze out other players from the good choices.

I really like Town Center for the way it forced me to twist my brain to think in a way in which I'm unaccustomed, in terms of three-dimensional spatial adjacency.

For such simple rules, there is a lot of complexity to the play: I cut you draw (with switch-back selecting) when allocating cubes each round, only indirect development of crucial buildings (apartments and shops), interesting scoring for building size and height vs money.

Unlike JC, I don't think right-left coupling is a major issue, since a well-planned city can be built in a variety of orders.

Despite having a lot of strategy and planning, I think a lot of the game between experienced players can come down to the luck of when particular bricks are drawn.

first impression (4 players): I like minimal games and here you only have basically cubes (and a player board where to place them) so it looked cool from the beginning. The game is actually pretty clever little game with you building for 10 rounds each round 2 cubes and then some cubes can expand if they meet certain criteria. Connecting separate "areas" most be done through this expanding and it offers a good puzzle like feel on to game.

What I liked:
- Minimal components
- Town-building theme
- 3-D aspect
- Appears to have a lot of depth
- Solo option

What I didn't like:
- Theme helps mnemonically, but it's mostly abstract
- Development and scoring rules are slightly hard to remember
- Stacking small cubes in a small space can be tricky
- I can imagine that the cube draft could inspire significant AP

This is a very clever design, but I don't really like the abstract nature, or the inelegant stacking of cubes. It's not something I'll want to play more solo, and my wife would hate it, and I can't see it working at game nights.

It's very easy to put together a PnP copy, so if it looks at all interesting to you, I strongly encourage you to give it a try.

I really want to like this game. Even if the components are a bit abstract, it's still really cool that you're trying to build an urban city that builds up. But overall, it falls flat to me. It's obvious that you have to get elevators, growth is critical but difficult to achieve, and the division of the cubes is generally obvious as well. Ultimately, some good ideas here, but the actual gameplay is fiddly, flat, and felt more like drudergy than a fun city-building experience.

Wow, it's a thinky game that was kind of tough to really grok, but I think it's pretty cool! May have to make my own Lego version, if it turns out the cubes are as difficult to play with as I think it's going to be!

--- Summary ---
This is a pretty cool city building game. Really, it's pretty abstract; but the city theme works pretty well. Each player is essentially building their own city, with no interaction except for competition in initial cube acquisition, and end-of-turn cube purchases. Cities are 6x6 grids, with the corners excluded. The central 4x4 area is downtown; the rest are suburbs. Players each start with one red cube placed somewhere in their downtown.

Each game, set aside 1 yellow and 1 black cube per player.

Each round, place a set of cubes (based on player number) into a bag. Each turn, draw 2 cubes/player, and stack in groups of 2. Switchback style, players take 2 cubes (one at a time). Cubes are:
- red = community; must pay $5 when chosen (if cannot, remove from game)
- black = parking lot (or elevated lot if stacked)
- yellow = power plant
- blue = shop
- green = apartment
Players place their cubes, with some rules:
- blue may not be adjacent (in 3-D) to blue
- green may not be adjacent to green
- black may only be stacked on black
- no building may be taller than the tallest black stack
- no stack may have more than 5 cubes

Then, red grows green: if a green apartment is adjacent to more red cubes than green cubes that compose it, add green cubes (either by stacking, or laterally) if possible. Similarly, green cubes make blue cubes grow.

At the end of each round, earn $1 + $1/parking lot + shop income from contiguous blue cubes that are adjacent to power stations. Income improves with both height and number of cubes in each contiguous block.

Finally, in reverse turn order, players may buy a single yellow or black cube (cost = $5 + $5 per similar cube already present).

The game ends after ... 10 rounds? At end of game, earn VP for powered green apartments, again based on height and number of cubes. Also convert leftover cash to VP -- most VP wins!

Fun, devilishly difficult little brainburning filler. Unfortunately it needs a comparatively lengthy rules explanation and most people still have trouble grokking it on their first play, which drags out the playtime.

The combination of turn order and cube draw seems problematic: the first player in a round has a strong advantage, particularly in the final round when they can guarantee picking up an office if one is available.

As a result I think I prefer the solitaire game, which is less interesting but much faster. (I am also awful at it.)

It took me 2 plays to really wrap my head around how to utilise the 3D aspects of Town Centre, but I'm glad I took the time and effort to do so. There's a great game here that really deserves a wider audience.

The new drafting (compared to Card City) has drawn some negative comparisons from people who've played both, but I actually really like this; here you're able to choose what you won't get, rather than what you will perhaps, though offices still seem rather essential and I don't think I've yet seen someone pass up the opportunity to get one. The game plays out very oddly when the offices all get stuck at the bottom of the bag...

The 3D nature of this really appeals to me - building UP and out is terrific! The blocky wood pieces all nicely stickered is fantastic looking on the board as you build your city. This game is so brain burny! So many options and the interactions of how the blocks comes out really changes things up nicely. With the expansions (which I haven't even gotten to yet) there are so many possibilities!

4th Edition, Kickstarted. A favourite to play with my wife.

RATING: 5
Rather simplified and abstracted version of Small City that has the same great growth mechanism as its elder sister but unfortunately also lacks the interaction and integration between theme and mechanisms that make Small City so good. Town Centre ends up being too multiplayer solitaire but is okay as a solitaire puzzle. First edition travels well too.

No. 34 out of 80.

This is more like a puzzle than a game. I enjoy puzzles, and I even enjoy many puzzle-like games, but not this one. The combination of the small amount of control you have over which pieces you get when and the very unforgiving nature of the puzzle ruin it - one wrong piece or one wrongly-placed piece early can ruin your board. (Placing a piece incorrectly is under your control, of course, but placing pieces perfectly sometimes requires many minutes of analysis which holds up the game for everyone else.)

Roundness in the town!! Learning game - we all forgot to power up our apartments. Going past $100 is fairly common, so we use a spare cube or counter, put it on the $ and use the track as-is (you can mark it with $100 to avoid confusion). 

Makes heads hurt at my house, but we like that!

Poorly written rules, extremely confusing. Will never play again. Sorry if I missed something that would make this game make more sense, but with all the choices out there, it's just not worth my time.

3D sequel to Card City with significantly upped brain-burning puzzle part in constructing your town.

Unfortunately also much less interesting "game" part simply stacking all the building cubes two by two and picking them off one by one in turn-order and reverse turn-order resulting in a lot of random luck of simply drawing the cube you really want. The Card City gradual, partial "I split, you choose" is much more interesting with less random luck and really what makes it a fun "game".

Town Center is the better "puzzle". Card City is the better "game".

Would like to try again using the Card City "I split, you choose" mechanism to divide/pick the cubes.

Abstract spatial arrangement puzzle. Not my thing.

RATING: 5
 Players acquire building blocks via a simple "I split, you choose" draft and then add them to their personal city boards, paying careful attention to the specific effects that different building types have when built next to each other. As blocks of different types can generally be built on top of each other (the first floor of a building could be a shop, the second floor an office and the third floor an apartment, for example), managing all the synergies between different building types becomes a complex 3D puzzle. 

Being a fan of spatial games, I find it pretty compelling in theory. However, in practice it may turn out to be too much of a non-interactive puzzle to really be a game I'm passionate about. While the draft occasionally offers some interesting choices, players are for the most part absorbed in their own personal boards; the draft feels almost like a separate mini-game that's played in between placement phases, where the real (solitaire) game takes place.

The puzzle part is correct. The "city growing" effect is pretty visual but I don't like the use of colors to represent the different types of buildings.

Super exclusive (but unsupported) first edition

After 10 or so plays (solo) this is easily becoming my favorite solo game. It is a living and breathing puzzle/game that is different every time I play it. Even so, the more I play the better I get. Upon my first play I was disappointed because I didn't feel like there was much for me to do to better my score - the random draws of the cubes seemed too much to overcome. But with further plays I see the subtle strategies required to achieve higher scores, and the game is beginning to reveal a deeper nature than I initially thought. I'm anxious to try a multi-player game since the cube draft looks to be devilishly clever. Even if I never get to play it with others this purchase was well worth the money spent just as a solo game.

3-D abstract puzzle using a cube draft to build cities on individual player boards. Mostly intuitive cube placement and adjacency rules. Elevators limit your building heights. Offices limit housing and housing limits shops. Games are short and it plays to 8 players which is always handy to have in a pinch.

RATING: 5
The production of the game is weak. I dropped one cube and knocked down my entire city. The rules on development are different for the apartments and the shops so it is a little confusing. Need to play again after reading the rules and the scoring. This rating could go up considerably.

The sad part is that this game had potential. It started out as an interesting puzzle game with an interesting theme until 1 mechanic destroyed it. The idea that you can connect buildings of one color across various rows and columns and call them one building is utterly absurd to me. It completely destroys the theme for me and makes the puzzle far more guess and hope than strategic planning.

As I approached the final scoring of my first game, I was thinking, "Um, the scoring really only goes up to 60+ for solitaire?  I have over a hundred.  Eh, well, still a pleasant [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b]."  Once I remembered that the points were only about a fifth of that, a smile crept across my face, for I knew I had much to learn and discover in this game.  [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b]

Allthough we knew the rules pretty well, everybody made some mistakes that we saw only after a few rounds. Very mechanical rules.

Nice looking game with a clear rulebook and plenty of scenarios.  Problem is, I can't get a face-to-face game and AVP is anti-VASSAL with this game.  So I'm left playing short scenarios solitaire, and that's a bit dull.  Way to go, AVP.

Great game!  The components are gorgeous!  Some say the maps are somewhat dull, but they quickly grow on you.  They are very coherent and easy to use.  My only complaint is that the rulebook is somewhat difficult to get through. But the rules are phenomenal!  Well worth the effort!

This one did not impress me too much because of the incomplete rules and lack of player aids.  The system may prove to be solid once all the kinks are worked out. (You'd think by third edition the kinks would already have been worked out, but noooooo!) My rating will probably rise if I give this a few more chances. There is a game in there that will run smoothly, I just have to find it.

An excellent re-tooling of the PanzerGrenadier system’s flagship game. The new-style maps are a welcome arrival – I’m simply not a fan of mounted maps – and the addition of the Romanian OOB greatly expands the game’s coverage. The scenario book presents an enormous range of situations and game lengths. All in all, great stuff.

The system is not 100% solo-friendly (as stated on the box and on the AP site). A lot of useful counters are missing from the game, so you must keep track of some game mechanics on paper. I really don't like the system: Move OR Fire. Inferior to Lock'n Load. Pros: a lot of troops involved and represented.

Despite that I have many of the games in this system, I keep struggling with it.  It's nothing in particular, but the sum of a pile of little things that bother me, though scenario design is a big part of that pile.  Much depends on the particular game box played, for some reason.  Still, I have issues with the LOS and Spotting on hills.  If the publishers would just fix the issues these present then I think the games would be very good, actually.

Airborne (Introductory Edition) and Elsenborn Ridge are probably my favorite of the games in this series.

Note: apparently there is a 4th edition rule, and a new series of boxed games, but I have looked into them.

A huge package of Eastern Front tactical action.  Scenarios aren't all balanced but there's so very many of them!  This and the companion ROAD TO BERLIN game established the PANZERGRENADIER system as the premier platoon-level WWII ground tactical system in existence. One wishes the rules were a good bit tighter, but the PG-HQ.COM website is an invaluable resource in solving those issues!

Nice counters, fair maps, okay rules, not-so-good play aids.  PG is a grinder and the scale is not familiar (platoon) so I don't have a good feel for it yet tactic-wise. Lots of dice rolling and serious marker switching in the scenarios I've played. Can feel tedious at times but the impulse turn system keeps things mostly interesting.

I have several games of the Panzer Grenadier Series. While they are excellent for solitaire play I don't play them any more because of the counter stacks. Again and again collapsing stacks like the World Trade Center towers with 10 and more counters. And always scanning through stacks. This is not my thing. Rules: 3 (1-3); Components: 2 (1-3); Replayability/Fun: 1 (1-3); Solitaire: 0 (0-1).

RATING: 7.5
Very interesting scenarios with lots of early war "tin can" tanks like the BT-5 and 7, T-26 and Panzer III. If your looking for lots of small tanks zipping about the battle field then this game is for you. Just don't expect to get AT kills at over 5 hexes in this game.

RATING: 9
It arrived! I must say that I am very, very impressed. You have to buy Eastern Front Deluxe, if you are into this system. I can’t believe the size of the scenario book and I do mean book! It probably cost a mint just to publish the scenario book. The game comes with 8 map boards, thick card –stock, coated with a protective layer laminate that makes the board excellent. Again excellent map boards! Board #2 is the big urban board. The boards are much lighter and more pleasing to look at. Tons of great counters! More armor variety then the first game and the whole Rumanian Army. There is no 150mm tracked SP but there are 15 other types of armor that weren’t in the first game. One counter error, the SPW251 needs a 0 armor factor. The Russians have cool ATR Infantry units, just to name a few of many additions. I can’t believe AP could put so much game into one box. I can’t wait to punch & clip counters into the next couple of days and there are a lot to clip with 5 counter sheets counting the markers.  The box is their best ever, as far as art-work. Again Great Box, Great Counters, Great Maps, Fantastic Scenario Book, Good normal rules and only one page of special rules in the scenario book, for some of those cool units like the Prime Movers which both the Russians & the Germans have this time around and good clear Hill-terrains rules. Great purchase, I highly recommend it and would do it again, even if it took a third job! :)

Scratch & Dent sale - box was barely collapsed in the middle with a small crease from one corner.  What a steal!Counters are 2/3" and are great but the map art is not my cup of tea.  The huge hexes on the map are a plus for those of us with sausage fingers.

This is a fun and simple system with just enough depth to keep it interesting.

This can be fairly 'bloodless' with a lot of retreats.  Realistic at this scale, but not always fun.

PG was first wargame system which we played with friend. I have some fond memories of it. Although we have find lot of small gaps in rules and thinks which we do not like that much (for example we house-ruled assault) added degraiding terrain and so on.

I did not like fact that with lot of infantry games tend to bog down a lot (due to lot of morale states) at the end games were sometimes lot of rolling rally attempts which was not lot of fun. But I did like tank battles or small battles were only few infantry units were.

I did not like Eastern Front as much as others because units are quite week here and this leads to lot of disrupted and only sometimes demoralized or killed results whic bog game down a lot.

RATING: 5
Excellent entry in the system.  With 110 scenarios, you can find one of the size and length to fit your mood.  The armor and anti-tank guns are early war models, so they aren't as potent as the units from the games set in the later war.  The eight maps provide a lot of variety and room for maneuver in most of the scenarios.

The game I play most. Just the best aspects among many more other ones:


1. Every nation has it's own units and you never have to use Americans as "British" etc... For me, this is very important and adds a lot of atmosphere.

2. The leader system is superb: When your army has more and better leaders, the game really plays differently. You can execute more difficult maneuvers, react more quickly to changes in combat situation, so your force is just much more flexible.

3. The morale system with the three states (normal/disrupted/demoralized) is just ingenious. So mostly you win by demoralizing the enemy, not just killing him. And by giving every force it's own appropriate morale values in every scenario you perfectly simulate the training, experience, fighting spirit, etc., estate of different units, without just giving them more firepower than the other ones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Simple rules and fairly good "feel". Units feel "tougher" (in that they don't die as easily as in other tactical games), but are also apparently harder to rally. Pace of game and length of game occasionally a little slow for my tastes.

Melee is terrible, stacking is terrible, scenarios are too similar, counters could have been better, the tables are so-so, too long, there are many games about WWII that are more creative, more fun, more realistic.

RATING: N/A
Eastern Front tactical warfare during 1941-42 in which Units represent platoons.

The Third edition ruleset is currently only 16 pages long.

This is the light medium wargame that you'll be able to get your friends to actually play.

The PG system is so simple but with enough depth to still be entertaining.

With 112 scenarios you really can't go wrong. My only complaint is that Soviet AFVs in this module don't have identifiers (they do in other modules) so keeping track of which tank(s) you've secretly assigned to be  tank leaders is more of a hassle than it should be. Just write down what hex it is in and its position in the stack each turn.

RATING: 9
Solid system, nicely differentiates infantry, armor and artillery at a level a step up from Advanced Tobruk System or other squad-level games.  (Counters are whole platoons, not squads.)  It is this "step up a level" aspect that requires a mental adjustment to understand the design and enjoy the game.  The action of ATS would take place in maybe six adjacent hexes on the Eastern Front map.  Enjoy your promotion.  Components are nicely done for the most part (counters, map).  About the only thing I don't like is the high stacks of counters, but it is just something you have to get used to with this game.

I'm a fan of the Panzer Grenadier system and, on the face of it, this is a worthy addition to the range.  Even if you already have the original Panzer Grenadier, the 100 or so extra scenarios and the addition of the Romanians make this a worthwhile investment.  (And the maps are a bit nicer than the originals).

One major problem, however.  APL have left off the ID numbers from the tank units.  In most scenarios the Soviets have fewer of the vital tank leaders than they have tank units.  In the past the player designated which tank has a leader on board by jotting down the ID numbers; now there's no way to do this.  This sounds trivial, but, in practice is very, very irritating and hinders play.  Fortunately I still have the original counters from the first edition.

This is a great game. Lots of scenarios. I really like the Romanians for some reason, maybe its the little red hats on the MTN troops. The only reason I didnt give this game a 10 is the lack of i.d. numbers on Soviet and Romanian armor units. Because these units are required to have leaders, and these leaders are assigned by writing them down on a piece of paper, and the tanks dont have different numbers on them, this can be irritating. I am just going to print out some numbers and paste them on, but I do feel this should be fixed in future products. Otherwise, its awesome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Surprisingly good. Fast playing with a good and clear rule set. Lots of scenarios ranging from only a handful of counters on a single map to dozens per side on 6-map monsters. The scenarios do not seem to be balanced very well or at all (which is no problem when soloing). 

The maps are butt-ugly, there is no way around that, but I found after some time 'in-game' I would not notice them anymore.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fills a nice niche that used to be filled by Panzer Leader and PanzerBlitz.  The simplicity of the rules permits the player to get into the game quickly and the subtlety of the system forces the player to consider combined arms tactics first.  

I am thrilled to see all the scenarios and the Romanians!!!  Individual scenarios can turn into maneuvering battles or pitched assaults but in all cases (so far) they are interesting and present both players with real choices.  The propensity for infantry assaults to end up being long running, exhausting affairs is representative of what really happened so for those who say that this is boring, read some actual history.  I rate this highly due to the subject matter, the playability, the simulation value and the fun of seeing the Romanians in a well produced game.

ASL and ATS tended to overwhelm me with rules.  I deal with lawyers and contracts all day and the last thing I want to do when I unwind is to sit with rulebooks and fight over the interpretation of rules.

I will agree that there are some repetitive sceanios and some unbalanced situations but hey, that's the price you pay for getting 112 scenarios in one box.

Quite likely I have no found my replacement game for Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader.  This game is great fun and the rules are pretty simple for a game depicting dozens of battles.  The leadership rules are excellent!  Well done!

RATING: 4
Better.  Having sampled PG a few years ago and being thoroughly unimpressed I gave it another go, avoiding jungles and deserts altogether.  For this game to be interesting there pretty much has to be a chance to employ combined arms - that's when stuff starts to happen.  The Eastern Front is an ideal location for that, with loads of panzers and even more Soviet armour, so I actually felt like I was working toward something instead of just marker shuffling as I had in the past.
Scenario integrity is still a concern;  there are a lot of samey scenarios here and more than a handful that just seem a bit dubious, but there's over a hundred of the things so, even if half of them are not great there's still plenty to keep oneself occupied. 

Update: Jettisoned all PG games from the collection as I didn't see myself playing them any longer.  I do not particularly like this scale and there are some far better realized tactical WWII games out there.

Call me daft but I find this game moving. It fires my imagination like no other game I've played and gives me a sense of what it must've been like to be in the USSR at that time, in that situation...I bought Heroes of the Soviet union, Edelweiss and Sinister Forces also and addore the compound effect of all the options open to me. Its not like me to gush like this but I've stopped playing my other games and have become addicted to PG. I admit I had my doubts - something clumsy in the counter art, the depiction of the map-boards on the back of the box not doing the actual items justice. I found the rules fiddly (and more complex than i originally thought) and didn't like the leader counters on top of so many piles. Now I find my mind works with the counter stacks and I sort of play through my finger tips if that make sense. It was a pleasure learning this game, it is very subtle and wise. The scenarios are varied and educational, ranging from full-scale battles to odd confrontations between mobile recce battalions and masses of reds emerging from the forests to make urrah charges. Heartily recommended and well done Avalanche. This has replaced Great War at Sea in my life.

After playing a few scenarios of Eastern Front I knew the Panzer Grenadier system was the one for me.

Relatively simple rules and a huge variety of scenarios and units.

Of course with this much quantity the quality can be lacking. Highly recommend PG-HQ before playing any scenarios for any errata. The scenario OOB don't suffer fools gladly and I've had to add some additional playing pieces to make the game easier to play - practically. A PG-HQ phone app would be much appreciated.

A note about Assaults.
The scale of the game both in unit size and hex dimensions means that assaults are the way to play the game - along with long range artillery barrages
With upto 6 units in a hex along with additional leaders and markers the game can prove fiddly with large numbers of pieces crammed close together.

This game really needs off map assault markers/ stack markers and I highly recommend tweezers for ease play.

Over the last 12 months I have acquired perhaps 70% of Avalanche Press' PG series - a highly recommended system.

Outstanding. Great core game for a great system. Didn't think I would enjoy East Front battles but have yet to be disappointed. I am playing the scenarios in order (since they are arranged chronologically in the book, I am essentially playing a very loose historical campaign). It's been rough on the Soviets so far, but the challenges they faced are well captured in the scenario design and it can be tremendous fun to play the underdog.

WWII Tactical combat at the platoon level. PanzerBlitz for the 21st century. Great looking graphics on colorful oversize counters depicting the troops, tanks, artillery, and aircraft in the fight. Beautifully rendered terrain maps - most games have a set of geomorphic maps, some have full size map sheets. The rules go PB one or two better; overall they are simpler - it's a different kind of combat system - and it adds leaders and morale factors absent in the older game. Tons of scenarios in every game - this game dealing mainly with the invasion of the Soviet Union. This title replaced the original edition 'Panzer Grenadier' as the lead game in the series and nearly doubled it in size.

I would give this an 8 similar to Squad Leader, but I give this a 9 for what it contains - over 100 scenarios, veeery nice components, and they finally make hexes bigger now for my aging eyes, lol. The game mechanics seem to be a vast improvement in playability for small unit tactics.

APL does not support Vassal, except in a very limited way, consequently I do not play the game often. There are many, many scenarios but few of them appear to be play tested. I do not merely mean that the scenarios are unbalanced, which they are, but that in some cases the victory conditions are impossible for one side to achieve even if the opposing player does nothing. APL defends this by saying that the scenarios are historically based and that in real life, battles were seldom "balanced" affairs. That is all well and good, but it is quite possible to have two sets of victory conditions, one of which is "historically" bases and one of which is "game" based. SPI used to do this 40 years ago, so it is quite possible - but that requires actual PLAYtesting.

Considering that the rules are I their third edition, they are poorly written and organized. Some folks appear to love this system and I guess that is fine for them. IMHO, there're just too many other good platoon-level games covering this topic and I would rather spend my limited playing time with those games.

Great value if you get into the system with 112 scenarios. If only the maps had had care taken with them.

After months of playing mostly Pacific theater games, it was interesting to try a fight on the open steppes.  Must relearn fire and maneuver gaming in this wide open terrain.

Eastern Front has a lot interesting scenarios, covering a wide variety of actions.  Chances are, if you dig through its 112 scenarios, you'll find something that interests you quite particularly.  I prefer Road to Berlin, but EFD is well worthwhile as well, and its boards and pieces are necessary for most modules

Playtest these scenarios - they're way too long for a simple tactical game.

So many dice throws; so much time. On the other hand so many scenarios, so much variety. I prefer the platoon 200m scale of PzGrn to the many squad based games; the common abstractions feel more correct for the Regiment/Brigade PzGrn size of game. The scenarios range in size and complexity. Its usually about half way through a scenario before I realise what I should have been doing, for which I like it all the more.

Only played a couple games from this, but the system is the same as before, so I'll play it many times to come.

Nice map quality - I like the somewhat-shaded method of elevation lines it uses.  Great component quality.  BUCKET of interesting scenarios.

Not bad at all. Loads of die rolling, but generates surprisingly interesting results. Rather generic maps and counters though.

Since buying some time ago, I've finally taken the plunge to learn this game.  I am very impressed.  The Vassal version allows me to play (solo) at my leisure and this appears to be a very solid game. Finished my first game.  After the initial shock, I am very pleased with the map and counter art.  

The game system is (also) very different from what I had been used to. After a few turns, it flows quite well.

RATING: 5
Disappointed after one play - seems very tedious and procedural. I can see the brilliant game design underneath all the rules for combat and moving, but multiple phases of deployments, operational movement, keeping separate track of Transport and Oil Points, etc., just made it much less intuitive than the description seemed.

RATING: 7.75
Covers the whole Pacific War in a way so it can be played in one lifetime. Rating based on first play through. Combines some clever systems for recreating what was a horribly complex theatre. Almost chess like and elegant system of action/reaction. As in reality, players who fail to plan ahead will lose.

Nearing the end of a full game my feelings are mixed. The game captures all the elements of the PTO quite well, but we are finding it is taking 2 hrs per turn ( i.e 1 hr per player). I don't think we are suffering too much AP, but it takes a while for the routines and sub routines to sink in. 

The first half of the game is tense as the Japanese could achieve the knockout blow, and it has the potential to get tense near the end as the allies see if they can take all the VP's back. It's just that after more than 20+ hrs of game play I'm not sure that the end result will justify the time spent...I might change my mind if I pull off victory in the final GT!

1/13/2011: I'm definitely going up the learning curve on this game, and the first thing that I'll say about it is that it is subtle.  I don't think that the rulebook is bad, but it is concise, and there is a lot that is not apparent when you are first reading the rules.

For me and perhaps other wargamers, the game seems really odd at first because each player turn there are 4 movement phases (1st Deployment, Operational Movement, Reaction, and 2nd Deployment) with slightly different rules and costs for each type, and different costs for each player.

However I'm finding that after staring at the board and going through examples enough that it is starting to come together, and is very elegant.  This game has several things going for it.  I like the asymmetry, and the fact that this game is about maneuver  rather than the emphasis on combat.  The artwork is very pretty, and I'm not put off by the clouds on the map.  On the other hand because it is so different from other games it's taken me a lot to get up to speed on it, and I'm not sure that I'll be able to get another local player interested.  The reward per hours invested in learning this game is a much lower ratio than other games.  Also I think that 6 hours of play once your up the curve is probably about right making learning games much longer.  This game may be a little long for its own good.

Prior to first play, it really seems to make sense for the Japanese player to have figured out his opening strategy for his first 2 turns and to have written this down in advance.  This is to save time, as well as to avoid silly oversights.  It also seems that you need to plan out each phase of your turn and the costs before you start any of your movement to make sure that you are budgeting correctly.  

For me a negative is the quality of the box and the map.  I don't like the MMP boxes and wish they went to GMT style boxes.  They are probably doing this for cost reasons, and to keep manufacturing of the game in the US rather than moving it over to China.  I also have problems with the glossy paper map.  It is prone to tearing easily when unfolded, and wear starts showing immediately along the fold lines.  I really like the thicker cardboard mapboards that several other games have (Columbia and GMT) but then the map artwork wouldn't be nearly so pretty.  Because the map is paper, I'd really recommend putting it under plexiglass (which can be obtained at Home Depot or other locations).

I wish I could rate this game higher, but for right now I'm not going to be investing any more time in it.

I particularly appreciated the elegance of the game design, though it shares the inevitable problem of any Pacific theatre game in that it's not very balanced. I know the art provokes mixed feelings, but I found it appropriate and I especially liked the big counters.

Also, the game provided one of my most enlightening moments when playing a boardgame: some simple rules about bases and air control and the map geography make it instantly clear why Guadalcanal was such a big deal.

Outstanding graphics.  Rules well written, although some methods are counter-intuitive for grognards.  Careful reading required.  IMPORTANT: Just about everybody should follow the sample turn at the end of the rulebook before playing--the time you invest will be worth the time you save by not playing incorrectly thanks to your study of the sample.  Looks promising!

I better understand why the Japanese counters were designed as they are; my cultural ignorance was fully on display.  The map is darker than I want, and the clouds are more a hindrance when one hopes for clarity.  

The rules have some neat nuances, but there are other aspects that I wish had been clearly stated.  For example, you can rebase your Naval unites; they do not have to stay in Pearl or Japan for the entire game.  You do this in the 2nd Deployment, paying the appropriate Oil and Transport costs (which makes this endeavour expensive).   

The "discussion" on CSW shows the forum in a bad light, not because of any flame wars, but because of the Jekyll and Hyde approach to dealing with questions.  And there are thousands of threads--there are over 5000 for FITS, so this is not hyperbole--that are useless when looking for insight or answers, along with at least one nasty crack at "BGG style gamers," whatever that means.

All this since 2007 when I first left comments.  One lesson to learn: don't let a disappointing map make you think that the design will likewise be a disappointment.

Initially excited, but then disappointed as the games turned out to be really tedious and boring. Not enough tension for me. Some will absolutely love the operational/resource aspect (oil management) of this game, but for me it was too fiddly and cost too much overhead considering the lack of bang it delivered. Also, too antiseptic for my tastes, especially the convoluted combat. Really disliked tracking 1/4 points of oil and doing the math to see if I could translate that into a very non-intuitive transport/move mechanism. Also, the extra-large hexes weren't my cup of tea either; hexes this large seem to make the game better suited to area movement. Too many ZOC exceptions. There are some who will really enjoy this title, but my recommendation is to play VitP: you get pretty much the same thing with out all the overhead. Inspired graphics though, and an A+ for trying. One of the best box covers ever, but not a good reason for me to keep it around. 

I think this game will appeal to certain tastes (just not my taste), so please read a review of someone who likes it.

Traded away.

Rating after one play.  Highly abstract system didn't give me the immersion I wanted.  Felt like I was playing a highly abstract game, not like I was running the Pacific War.

Adam Starkweather taught me ot play this game at Conquest NW 2007 this past weekend. It is a beautiful game and is very challenging inspite of the low counter density. I think if I had known more of the rules and been better rested I might have enjoyed the game more. I did manage to win the tournament scenario as the Japanese despite my abysmal management of my oil resources. I failed to take Guadacanal and Rangoon, but did capture Port Moresby and the island chain south of Guadacanal as well as sink 2 American Carrier groups at the cost of only 3 sunk destroyer groups and 1 damaged heavy cruiser. My opponent Robert Alvey was a great opponent.

This is not an easy game to get into. In fact, I would compare it to Napoleon's Triumph as far as that category is concerned. Be prepared to make mistakes, rerereread the rules, make more mistakes, make the same mistakes, etc.. 

But is it worth the trouble?

After one play, I would say .... yes! 

This is a game of some note once you start to unravel the mysteries of its mechanics and sequence of play. Perhaps my interest is substantially piqued due to my unfamiliarity with Pacfic WW2 strategy games, but I am finding something new with each turn played.

Remember the NT reference above? I equate them for several reasons and one such is that both are highly nuanced. I suspect that half the challenge of playing FitS comes from  discovering the need to maneuver your units not just for this turn, but for the future. There is a balancing act here which is compounded in difficulty due to the need to consider transport and oil resources. And I suspect there is plenty of wiggle room in both choosing your strategy, but also in determining how to achieve it. 

This is not a beer and pretzels games by my estimation. It will take time to learn and it will take consideration each turn.

UPDATE: (I'll have to clean up this lengthy comment at some point ...) I enjoy Fire in the Sky, but it is quite abstract. Like most Pacific War games, it seems, it overplays the importance of the battleships to give them something to do. If one were to play out the battle of Midway in FitS with the forces that were present, the US CVs would destroy the IJN CVs on schedule, but then the Japanese landing forces would be able to land on Midway without the Americans being able to do a thing about it, since the CVs have spent themselves. In reality, of course, an invasion force without aircover at that point would have been seriously risky as the CVs would have reloaded and attacked again. Asia Engulfed and Pacific Victory seem to handle this much better. Also, while I like the Transport and Oil point pressures in general, there seem to be significant problems when compared to history - the US just don't have enough transport points to deploy the historical units to the South Pacific in '42, or to maintain them there, and in general keeping operations going in distant theatres (South Pacific for the US, CBI for the Japanese) seems unreasonably expensive because of the fact that after any operation, you have to return all the way to Japan/the US and then pay transport points to redeploy in-theatre. I understand what it's trying to represent, and it's a good try, but running operations just seems really expensive. For example, let's say you want to do Gaudalcanal. You need the Marines, a CV, a couple destroyer escorts, and a small fleet of surface ships, some destroyers and cruisers and maybe a BB to protect the infantry. The CVs can op-move direct from Pearl, but the invasion TF needs to deploy three hops to a nearby base with sufficient capacity - a whopping 18 transport points for BB, CA, 2xDD, 1xMarine Division, or more than the entire US capacity of 16. So it takes two turns (4 months) to set up. But that's not the really odd part. Let's say you position the forces, do the landing, win, and then want the BB and CV task forces to stick around and cover the inevitable IJN counter-attack ... the two TFs have to return to base in the US after the invasion, so to get them back into intercept range of Guadalcanal would be an incredible 21 transport points, more than the US can afford until the very endgame. There are also certainly examples of historically plausible Japanese operations that similarly just can't be run in FitS due to the incredibly tight transport constraints.

All this doesn't make FitS a bad game, just an odd one when compared to history.

 In general I think AE is a much better, albeit more complicated, game. If FitS had half the playing time, it would be great, but it doesn't.
---
UPDATE: I think what makes this game so hard to learn is not that it's complicated, but the order of presentation. The rules give you a lot of stuff up front which you have no context to understand at the time. It only gets to the actual sequence of play fairly late.
---
Only a year from purchase to play, not too bad ...

We struggled with the rules unduly. I'm not sure why this is; FitS is really not that complicated a game. I'm not sure if the rules just aren't explained clearly, or the player aids aren't great, or if the system is just slighlty awkward, or if it's just a bit too process-heavy, or if it's a combination of all of these things to a slight degree, but for a fairly straightforward game it's a bit of a struggle to learn.

But once I got my head around it, I rather liked it. It's pretty clean-playing once you get going, and it's a rather different wargame. The emphasis is hugely on the management of transport and oil points. Deploying ships around the Pacific is very expensive, and the pressure on transport and oil points is extreme. I think Fire in the Sky manages to find a nice spot in terms of capturing strategic, operational, and tactical decision-making, without undue emphasis on any one area; the game is not excessively tactical, but neither is the complexity of managing transport or oil points overbearing. It's almost euro-like in its emphasis on management over tactics or strategy. Shame about the length; no less than 8 hours, I think, and that is probably the game's biggest problem (and a pretty significant one).

I doubt it'll be a long-term winner, just because the situation has gaming issues and the playing time is a little too long, but I was still overall fairly impressed.

Although the rulebook denies, it, Fire in the Sky does strike me as a hugely upgraded Victory in the Pacific. It's got that same feel, that of trying to get the right units to the right place at the right time, and then trusting to a ton of die rolls. It's not as chaotic as its predecessor, and the operational details are much more interesting, but I think most gamers will see the similarities. I also think Fire in the Sky is ultimately not quite as much raw fun to play as Columbia's Pacific Victory, which seems a cleaner, faster-playing system of more reasonable length. But all that said, I quite enjoyed it and look forward to playing again.

Final comment on the presentation: I have become of quite mixed minds on the graphics and presentation on this game. I love the aesthetics of the game, the interesting map and counters. The ergonomics, however, are another matter entirely: The counters are huge but the relevant information that distinguishes one ship from another is tiny, and the design on the "in port" side is quite noisy. Some control markers would have been nice. The information on base capacities is presenteted in a confusing manner in my opinion. The quick-reference cards could be better. And would it have been too much to ask to have the off-board boxes and other reference information on the map FACING THE RELEVANT PLAYER instead of all facing the US?

Although some of the details just don't work, the look is still interesting; I just wish more attention had been paid to usability (same complaint for Shifting Sands). Over at GMT, I sometimes think they've gotten into a rut as all their games look the same and recent games have had some graphic design issues; but Mark Simonitch and Lee Brimmicombe-Wood know how to present a game.

15-20 years ago, before euros, before most of my peer had kids, this would have been a much cooler game I think. Today? The playing time is a real problem.

Very clever design, strong and effective artwork, if you accept everything being upside down on the map for the Japanese. Rules rather too terse but meaning what they say. Major problem is the play length. They say 5 hours but unless one of you makes a mess I suspect most new players will be taking closer to double that.

Were it shorter an 8, but it isn't.

Graphically exceptional. Good resource management aspect combined with a fair few operational possibilities. The rules on deployment, operations, and transport combine nicely with the positioning of the available bases to portray the difficulties both sides faced in fighting this war.

Quite possibly the only game of the Pacific War at this level that I'll ever buy. However, the game is let down by what it's portraying - fundamentally the Pacific War is not always that interesting a conflict. If the Japanese player hasn't won by mid-43, it's a long slog to the end as the USN batters away with its overwhelming advantages.

RATING: 6
In most respects a fantastic game on an oft ignored theater of WWII.  Both sides face resource challenges and can never do all that they'd like.

But the gem has flaws.  The mechanics are highly procedural, yet filled with nuance.  The rulebook does a terrible job of teaching the game.  I'm not sure it could do better, the game has so many unique mechanics and ways of looking at things.

Still, one shouldn't be playing a game for the third time and find themselves wondering ... does this unit have to attack?

It's the type of game you'll find hard to walk away from, but in the end - it is very long, more difficult to learn than it should be, and you may never feel convinced that you're playing it right.

I have no regrets that I got a copy, but I don't know when it'll make it to the table again.  There are just too many other equally good games that are shorter vying for time on that same table.  In the Pacific theater, Victory in the Pacific stands head and shoulders over FitS - being more realistic and infinitely more elegant in application.

I suggest playing only the first 6 turns and if the Japanese have 16 or more points after the end of turn 6 - they win.

RATING: 7
This game is a mixed bag for me.  It's long (ten hours seems very optimistic... particularly during early games), which makes it tough to play, but luckily it's a standard size map that I can set aside easily between turns.  There is certainly tension in this game and I enjoy the feeling of resource management and the difficult choices Japan faces.  However, some of the rules aren't intuitive for me at all.  Why is it that ships at port can only be attacked by air units?  Why can't carrier task forces be attacked during surface battles?  It just seems odd to me.  Also, with all the units, this game can be a real brain burner and very prone to AP - similar to A Victory Lost.  So, I can't see myself playing this game too many times, but I've had fun the few playings I've gotten in.

RATING: 8
Excellent game. Probably the best board wargame I've ever played. Lots of thought but it's about *strategy* never about the minutiae of the rules.

I've reduced my rating slightly for the following reasons:

The game is somewhat too linear for my long-term tastes. Japan does everything whilst the US watches in the first part of game, and then in the second part the positions are reversed. Historically accurate, but it doesn't make a good game

The second issue is that Japan doesn't really have much in the way of option. There are three ways to win: capture India, capture Hawaii or grab and hold, with a stab at the US-Au supply link.

The UK player has to be utterly incompetent, to the point of moving most of his units out of India for Japan to have any chance. The slow movement and accelerated UK reinforcements should the Japan start to get anywhere (plus strategically it unbalances your forces and leaves the way wide open for the US).

To get Hawaii you have to not only get an awful lot of good luck but you have to act as if you will get it: and if you don't then you've lost in the first or second turn. You might just as well not bother setting up and instead roll 5 dice: if they all come up 6 Japan gets Hawaii, if they don't then the US wins.

Which leaves the only possible strategy a grab and hold along with a stab at breaking the US-Aus supply line for some VPs the allies can't recover.

Again, seems historically correct to me, but doesn't make a great game: although I still stand by my original comments about how well the rules have been done so 8/10 no longer 9.5/10.

For anyone who's wanted to play the Pacific War over the course of an afternoon--albeit a slightly longish afternoon--FitS is good for what ails you.Wihtout undue overhead or fiddly management, FitS touches on the historical aspects of the Pac War. Issues such as limited Japanese resources and shipping, plus the USA's slow grind toward its status as a "Mighty Giant" are present and drive a number of tough choices for each side throughout the game. FitS offers up the classic case of having umpteen things you'd like to do, a handful of things you must do, and still fewer things you can actually do.

One point of consideration, it takes a special breed of gamer to play the Japanese side. As history denotes, the initiative can inexorably shift to the Allied player in longer games. The Japanese role can become one of spoiler rather than out-and-out victor, at least in terms of leading large offensives. Still, the game accounts for this well by stating that Japan will always lose the war, but they can certainly win the game (by thwarting the Allies). If you can hang with this outlook and mechanic, you'll do fine with FitS.

Simply amazing.  Fire in the Sky is a relatively simple wargame which nevertheless manages to both put logistics in the forefront AND remain a blast to play!  For instance, the difficulty of operating far from home is neatly captured by forcing ships that sortie to return all the way home (from which point they can immediately be deployed back to forward bases, but at a cost).  It looks screwy but the result is correct.

My hat is off to the designer - this is a brilliant design.  The rules are a little difficult to "get" at first, primarily because many things are DIFFERENT from any other game I've played, but they are not complex.  There's a surprising depth to it with many, many important choices to be made which can have a tremendous impact on the game.  All that, and playable in a relatively short period of time... how can you NOT love it?

The game is too scripted with a set reinforcement schedule for the US. Also the Japanese player has to for tome accounting all the time while the Us just can play with ease.
The scale of the hex and supply rules also limit the places of attack giving very few strategic options.
The combats are roll to hit Risk type with very little modifier and are not very exiting.
Finally there is no fog of war, everything can be seen and planned, no surprise anywhere.
Overall, I found the game rather boring and very limited in gameplay options, lacking tension and flavor.

I really like the 1" counters.  The map could be better.  I had to provide some markers to represent control of bases, as both sides can have units present from turn to turn.  The combat system is buckets of dice, which integrates air, naval, and land units very well, however, it can make it difficult to decide how many units to commit in order to ensure success.

I read once where good generals study strategy and tactics, while great generals study logistics.  This is a logistics game.  It is also Japan's game to lose.  If Japan has some bad rolls/decisions early on, then they lose.  To mitigate this, play the scenario that starts on turn two.

I should note that I have only played solo.  I would like to play against another person, and could see my rating increase.

A very nice streamlined design of the Pacific War. Very brilliant how the design just comes together. I especially like the emphasis on logistics with the management of the transport points, return to base and the oil points for the Japanese, yet it doesn't bog you down with bean-counting. Very smooth gameplay that should get the game to finish in about 6 hours. However, the abstractness of the rules did give me some trouble but once you figure out what's what, it hums along quite nicely. Too bad it shares the problems that all strategic PTO games have. The situation just isn't that replayable. In FitS, Japan has about three main options (Central Pacific drive, India and interdicting Australia) and two of which (Central Pacific and India) leave it very vulnerable if things go very wrong. So fun for a few games to explore minor tactical variations, but that's about it.

Fire in the Sky does a good job of simulating the logistics of the Pacific War. What holds back are the combat rules, which are convoluted considering it is mostly a lot of dice rolling.

So I decided to sell this game. I needed the money and I find most people are turned off by a heavy dose of logistics in wargames. So this one is just collecting dust right now and it deserves better. Too bad really. :(

Finally got a chance to play twice over vassal.  I like this game, but it has a few issues that make me want to trade it.  1.  Its more complex than advertised.2.  Its pretty long.3.  The transport and oil points, while fun, feel more like power grid than Hannibal.  Overall, I think its a very good game that handles a difficult situation well.  The components are incredible and I'd love to play it again.  At the same time, I think I'll trade it away.  Its a very good wargame, but there are so many good long two player wargames out there and its not that often I get a chance to play one, so it has to be an incredible experience for me to keep the game.  This has some of the most beautiful components I've seen in a wargame.  If a copy fell in my lap, I'd keep it.  Lots to like.  I will probably regret trading it at some point.

Played a third game via VASSAL post trade: I still feel the same way.  
The game is fun, but the oil and transport points feel very mechanical and spreadsheet-like.  You are so constrained in what you can do with them that the number of different strategies you can try is pretty limited.  When one side is limited in this way, it limits how the other side can react.  Normally I do not dislike highly simulationist game mechanics limiting ahistorical strategies, but in this game, its a highly abstracted system that is limiting the different strategies!  

FitS is a great game and I do enjoying playing it, but I find it ultimately frustrating.  I do not regret trading it, but it does make me want to try some other pacific war themed games.

Very coherent rules and almost no gaps.  It rarely happens in wargames...
Mechanics is interesting and quite adequately simulates clashes between combined land, navy, submarine and air forces on the strategic level of the Pacific front.

BUT:
- the game is very unintuitive - both in terms of rules and strategic possibilities.  It takes much of time to get used to it.  Paradoxally, the rules are short.
- the game is extremely long (easily 15+ hours for the first plays) and the return for investment is low.  Fun delivered does not compensate for the insane playing time.  No true feeling of being a commander of the Pacific front, no tension and no dramaturgy of events shaping up into a story unfolding before your eyes.  Just tedious, repetitive and tiresome moving of tokens and resolving lenghty battles...  Rather boring - and quite abstract - experience in the long run...

Still, I appreciate the effort the designer put into the game and I truly believe that if someone is able to find the beauty, to unearth the competitive edge capable of releasing emotions that the designer has buried deep down, it can be really great and exciting game for him...  (personally, I'm not able to do it).

RATING: 7
Fire in the Sky is just too damn long.

The key element that sets the game apart is its focus on logistics. Success hinges on the efficient use of your oil and transport allocations. You need to get ships into position and plan effective operations against the enemy - and they better work, too, because every ship that participates in the operation is returning to your base for a refit if it survives the battle. Engaging your opponent is not really about risking your ships, as you would expect. It's about risking all of the resources it took to bring your ships to bear, because those are gone, win or lose.

That's fairly interesting. The sequence for each battle is involved yet streamlined: abstracted enough to work without too many hitches, complex enough to avoid being obvious. The downside is that Fire in the Sky just keeps going, and going, and going. Unless the Japanese score the early knockout win, you're going to be there for hours upon hours (think: 10+ for new players). In our game, the Japanese routed the American Navy at the end of 1942, and that was four hours of game time. Experience would speed things up, but not enough to make the game worthwhile. If I had a convenient place to leave this game set up, I'd be happy to play 2-3 hours at a time once a week... and maybe that's the wargamer's approach, after all. All I can say is I'm hoping for juicier gameplay to playtime ratio out of A Victory Lost.

The key feature of Fire in the Sky is the logistical model, which has you spending transport points (and oil for the Japanese) to get things done.  The game's greatest strength is, however, its greatest problem as one must fully understand this model to sit down and get anything done, setting a very high threshold for new players.  

Unfortunately, in a comparison between this and Victory in the Pacific (AH), I'd rather play the latter as it is much easier to set up and get into.

This is a tight little game on the Pacific war. It does not end with the Bomb, but when the US has contained the Japanese back to their pre '41 pacific control.

The game is not complex, but it is no axis & allies either. It has subtleties that make it a challenge to find the best strategies to win, and that is one of the things that makes it fun for me.

RATING: 7
Elegant resource/transport management mechanisms that capture the problems of distance for both sides.   Combat resolution mechanisms add a terrific narrative feel to each battle (equaling or bettering that of Pacific Victory).  Plays quickly after some experience (it's a procedure-heavy game and very slow going at first).  Requires some carefully thought-out initial play by the Japanese player (as any PacWar campaign would).  Rules seemed quite a bit more difficult than they needed to be.

Presented the best historical narrative of any PacWar game I've played (admittedly few...in order of preference: VitP, PV, EotS).


The claimed playtime requirements are a bit silly and might only be achievable with loads of experience with the game [i] and [/i] quick players.

I am a big fan of the Pacific war when it covers the whole theater, my main experience comes from the "Pacific Theater of Operation" video games. One of the problem that all board games have compared to the video game is that the first half of the game, the japanese will be very active while the americans sit and wait, while on the last half of the game, the americans will be active while the japanese wait.

That seems to be a problem with all pacific war game and it's probably a reason why there are so few. It might be more suitable for a solitaire game.

Anyways, I played my first game yesterday as the US. It took me around 8 hours to play which is a lot. It will probably speed up with more gameplay experience. I could not manage to win, I was missing 6 points, and my attacks on Manilla and Singapore failed on the last turn. But apparently I screwed up movement my paying too much at some point of the game which brings me to the main issues of the game.

Now one thing I like about this game is that even if they are a lot of rules, they relatively make sense with the theme. The main problem is the lack of consistency within the rules.

For example: Air battle, sea battles and land battles all work differently. Sometimes the same value is used differently. For example, ship strength is used for bombardment as 1 die per point, but it is used for sea battles as roll 1 die, compare with target armor and look at a chart. The becomes simply very annoying.

There are some nice mechanics in that game, like a wounded ship comes back 2 turns later (6 month) so you simply place the ship on the time track. But as soon as a ship is wounded it is removed from the battle, which I found a bit boring. Because if it stayed, not only it could be useful, but it could also be attacked with other weaponry in order to accumulate more damage and have a chance to finally being sunk. The Yamato has 1 chance on 36 to sink. If I could combines sub, planes and ship against him, I could accumulate more than 1 hit in order to increase his chances to sink. But in the current system, if a weaponry does not score more than 1 hit, we check if it is sunk and then remove it from the battle.

The Other annoying problem is movement. Unless you can attack directly from your home port, you need to move you ship to a base, to attack from there afterward. Once they are used, the ships returned to home port. Now the problem is that you are limited in the number of transports you have and you can only move 4 hex this way, sometimes forcing you to pay double to deploy your fleet. So that in the end, you have a huge pile of ship waiting at pearl harbor, but you can only use 25% of your whole armada each turn. That is just frustrating. 

Then if you want to land troops, it cost you a huge amount of transport points, especially for a 8 strength unit. There is also a stacking limit which is sometimes very annoying for ships and forces you to pay double to move further away. That limit eventually double, triple or quadruple, which now becomes easy to forget applying the rule when it happens.

So you basically need 1 turn to position your ships then another turn to attack. Only near the end you have enough transport to do both if you are not making any landings. Or if you only use strength 2 or 4 strength units. Personally, I would have used transports for troops and planes, but not for ships. I would allow all ships to move their speed each turn, without transport, and if you are really out of range, you could have docked those ships to attack on the next turn. But the transports restrictions prevent you to do so.

Troops are another problems. First there are different denominations on the board which complexifies the game for nothing. Second, those troops are sometimes invincible. It's very hard to destroy a unit completely unless if has a very low denomination. But more importantly, they can be resupplied quickly even if in enemy territory with transports. So you cannot try to win by slowly grudging your enemy because any damage made on the enemy will simply be recovered afterwards by paying transports. So there are some land battles that we simply ignored because we knew that it would have no impact on the outcome.

I think the game suffer a lot of halving and doubling value. Planes in adjacent hex can support battles but at half strength. What am I going to do with 6 planes now worth only 3 planes when you have like 16 in your carrier force. How is it useful to have and odd number of planes on a base if it will only count when defending. Another annoying thing about planes is that there is no way to destroy them. The only way to destroy them is to specifically attack them when they are landed on a base. Shooting them from the sky does nothing. So we ended up losing almost no plane tokens making plane reinforcement pointless.

In general, all the elements to make a good game seems to be there, but the complex and inconsistent rules does not make it convenient to play. But that does not seem to bother war gamers. I am pretty sure a better game could be made by reusing the same pieces which are in general nice (I like the size of the token because they are easier to manipulate). 

The game is probably better than other games out there, even if there is not many competition, but it would need a complete revamp to become awesome.

The game descriptions look very promising. It has one standard map with extra large hexes and counters.  The map is nicely done but not particularly groundbreaking.  The coutners graphics are somewhat not relevant to the unit it represents and they are a bit busy to read.  The counters represent infantry divisions and individual combat vsessel.  The entire Pacific War is therefore can be gamed out in one long session.  The downside is that there is no shorter scenarios but only a 16-turns full campaign or a "shorter" campaign with one turn less (the first turn where Japanese made all the suprises). Some rule on the land combat also scratches me head as it seems to be odd to calculate whether the enemy is eliminated by the amount of damage the enemy inflicted plus his defense strength.  This is a cross of 2 unrelated factors to me.  Other than this, the system is intricate with an amount of details on how to handle air-land-surface combats.  It is a neat design.  But it requires some time to get familiar with.  Something in between Pacific Victory and Empire of the Sun.  Overall, a game which has rich potential to become a classic but it might need more time to explore to get full enjoyment out of it.

I fail to understand why there is a cloud layer in the map. This just makes it difficult to figure out land portion of the hexes. The Counters are confusing in the front side. Why do the destroyers have CL meaning Class on the font side, while there are also Light cruisers counters as CL? Pretty confusing.... I'm studying the rules and i found out a updated, resource management version of Victory in the Pacific. Bad taste graphic design on a otherwise promising good game...

RATING: 4
An unexpected disappointment.  Not really bad and this is a very hard topic to do right with a small footprint, but I had expected more. The physical components are the start.  I find the graphics brilliantly executed in the detail but baroque and overloaded for play. This would be the wargame to go to for finding convincing eagle plumage, but that's not really what I'm after. The big counters do nothing for me and are actually hard to read with surprisingly small numbers, confusingly arranged (I couldn't keep remembering what was the surface and what the AA combat rating).  The bright boxes on map and battleboard tend to actually hide which boxes have units in them.  (The GJ Special Issue #2 Japanese re-edition uses the same counters but a map that makes it easier to find units.)

Play is fairly tense with many subtle decisions at multiple levels, at least for the Japanese who have to painstakingly preplan their transport requirements over at least a couple of turns ahead.  The Allies on the other hand essentially conduct their advance on a turn-by-turn basis and swamp the Japanese with overwhelming force.  The main balancing factor seems to be that damaged ships are out for an excessively long period, so by being aggressive early on you can delay being swamped.  I am generally a fan of small games but this seems to be a problem with the situation.  In a detailed game I can be beaten up as the Allies strategically while still enjoying ambushing the Japanese - or I can enjoy a tactical victory as the Japanese even while slowly strangling logistically. But there is not enough detail for that at this level - you line them up and roll the dice.

The system is a bit fiddly with  distinctions that don't really come out well, we were still looking lots of things up on the fourth evening of playing. Even the battles, following a strict sequence, require massive leafing back and forth over the combat rules. 

The ground combat/invasion mechanisms seem to work better than in its main competition, Pacific Victory and Victory in the Pacific.  But the system is plagued by the bane of many large scale Pacific games, too few breakdown units for the Japanese and excessive combat outcomes.  Two hits on a pair of carriers will see them damaged for 9 months even with the errata which is about a turn more than any surviving carrier spent in repairs.  Land-based air is turned away even by the AA fire of a carrier-less 1942 British task force, does little damage except on transports, does not affect supply, and is then wiped out by a successful invasion.  In fact this game seems to have been designed by the IJN and USN battleship admirals.  Superior surface forces, not the carriers, are the sole arbiters of invasion success - your supplies will flow in the face of complete control of the air by the other side.  I'm sure that would have surprised the Japanese starving on Guadalcanal to no end... Allied ground troops can be sent out on Hail Mary invasions because if things go wrong they'll be back next turn and if they go badly wrong they'll be back in two turns.  This is a world away from the careful husbanding of your good troops (US Army, Marines, and foreigners) that I've experienced in the more detailed Pacific games.

The final straw is the length.  This is a small game (if you look past the inflated components), but it doesn't play like one.   On the fourth evening we were still spending in excess of an hour per turn, with lots of rule checking.

I'll still come back to this as I hope it will eventually gel on me and then I can give it a better rating.  Perhaps solo it a few times as it certainly is a thinking man's game.  But I had hoped it would supersede Pacific Victory with its flaws as the one-evening (or two-evening) Pacific game and that it doesn't do.

Beautiful elegant wargame set in The Pacific in WW2. Grand strategy at the highest level. Imbalanced player powers make for interesting strategy.

I want to rate this a 10, but the rules are difficult and fiddly. They are hard to read and remember, so you keep flipping back to check te rules. The rules are good so they work brilliant, but just memorizing them is an arduous task which makes the game quite difficult to learn and teach.

Nice to solo, since one side always has the initiative and the other is just reacting.  Very well balanced and exciting to play.  Rather a "non-standard" wargame but in a positive way.  With all of the player aids graciously shared by the Boardgame Geeks links here and some trial and error, the mechanics are easily mastered.

Preliminary rating based on one very quick playthrough of a few turns.  Other than its simplicity there isn't a lot of novelty here, and the end game victory seems historically off (the US can do worse than historically, but still win the game?).

Graphics are outstanding, rules are pretty good but strike up a number of questions so far for me.

A fascinating game that can be played from beginning to end in a reasonable amount of time and provides a nice "feel" for the Pacific War.  My other experiences with games depicting the entire war in the Pacific have been of the monster(War in the Pacific-SPI) or mini-monster variety(USN, East Wind Rain, Pacific Fleet).  Great games, but not nearly as "playable" as Fire in the Sky.

After reading the rules a couple of times, I felt kind of stupid that I wasn't able to understand what was going on. Finally I had a chance to sit down with a friend and fight our way through the game. Somewhere around turn three or so, the game started to sink in.

After playing, it seemed like a war game with some Euro game bits. It is an IGUGO game, but with recations, you really have to make sure you plan your resources well. You never will have enough and will always be one Oil or Transport point short. Learn to live with that and love it.

The map works very well and is informative (thought I would have liked to have had the sequence of play on both sides of the map and I would have liked for the japanese base boxes facing towards the japanese player (did they intend to have both players sitting on the same side of the map :P )).

This is a very classy game and I am very happy to own it. The paintings of the planes are wondeful and a bit of needed wimsy to war gaming.

RATING: 3
Great components, the map and counters are outstanding and the rules are well written and easy to follow. Great battle mechanics.  

You really need comprable experienced players because a mismatch makes for a lopsided game.  The Japanese have no margin for error.  The more I play the less I like this game.  Very scripted start and luck of the dice determines the course of the game rather then inovative strategies. This is more a recreation simulation then a game but has somewhat abstract victory conditions to push the Japanese player early and the American player later on.  I think the game end could have been cut in half to save time, I'm not a fan of the "hang on" victory conditions if a quick victory is not achieved, but I also am not a fan of the quick victory conditions with the way the Allies are hampered in the beginning.
I stopped playing after a gamey strategy was uncovered that completely turned me off.

I ended up selling this game, too much down time and too long to play for me as a FtF game. Those qualities do make for a perfect PBEM game.

RATING: 8
One of the starkest and most striking pieces of box art in a wargame.

Played a couple of games now and it's impressive to see the whole of the theatre in a sitting done in a historically plausible way.  Seeing a lot of asymmetric-sides titles from Japanese/IGS games now where one side is ascendent and then hangs on for dear life.  FITS is one of these.

Big thumbs up for the graphics inside the box.  Nice!

In my opinion a very well designed game. If one does not want a monster sized Pacific war game this would be the game for you. It captures various aspects of the war transport limits, Japanese oil suppy, submarine warfare, etc. One game I am glad I got. I salute (bow) to Mr. Nakamura in honor. The rules are a bit vague in how sunk CA & DDs return to the game. The only thing I didn't like was the background on the counters. I thought they were a bit gaudy. The Japanese ones weren't as bad. I have liked the game so well I have not felt compelled or been interested in getting any other WWII Pacific theater games not that others are bad like Empire of the Sun for example.

RATING: 6.5
2.13 update. taking the rating down a notch (from an 8) due to the fact that playing it requires the headspace i don't have much of nowadays. i would love to play it, but, alas, setup and having to re-read the rules makes it impossible to get on the table for the foreseeable future.

.... 

Taking it easy with a short scenario before trying the full game. The mechanics seem sound -- although there's a very discrete and meticulous way of going through the game sequence that might distract from the bigger picture.

At this point, fortunately, I do get and appreciate the resource-management angle. I find that decisions have meaningful consequences. And I actually like that the different movement and combat sequences use different mechanics. It's like a collection of different dice games working in concert.

As a navy-brat who grew up in San Diego, I'm always open to Pacific Theater games. This is my first try in that genre. Paid OOP prices for it. So far, it's been worth it.

Its not hard to find good things to say about FiTS. The map is a glorious piece of art that will be mounted and placed on my wall between sessions as it provides a vastness to the Pacific Theater I've always yearned for. I love the colors and definition the counters present - with the spot on Cherry Blossom background for the Japanese a huge bonus. 

Tactically, the game provides an impressive dive into the entire Pacific War in a 5 to 6 hour setting. Unlike many games that require days/weeks or even months to complete, this is a huge bonus for me and I can well imagine once I become more familiar with the mechanics that time can be cut to 3-4 hours.

Overall there is enough meat in this game to provide for serious replay opportunities, while also allowing the player to flex their brain power to try different approaches and tactics. According to multiple replays by fans of this game, FiTS gives the possibility for the Japanese to win, and that alone makes the prospects of playing as them a much more enticing idea.

Combine all this with a game that was brought to us from Japan, created from the viewpoint of a Japanese designer: Tetsuya Nakamura and presented with grace and dignity, these factors all add up to a winning combination.

I rarely rate games this highly without multiple replays, but one thing is for sure, FiTS captures your attention and doesn't let go. A solid 9.5 in my book!

Great game on the Pacific war. I had trouble in my first game wrapping my head around the game mechanics( does this sound familiar ) but now I know that it was me and NOT the game. My suggestion to anyone who wants to try this game is don't give up if your having problems making sense of it as ( for me anyways ) somewhere around  mid-game the lightbulb goes on and everything comes together. When this happens you will understand why everyone is giving this game the accolades it deserves.

RATING: 7
I dislike the clouds drawn on the ocean map--I want to see the ocean and the islands. It seems, too, that the values on the huge 1" counters could've been in a larger font, and could've been placed so that they aren't half-on, half-off the underlying graphics, for legibility purposes. (The pink Japanese counters also kind of mar the effect.)

However, despite these (to me, silly) design choices, I like this game. (It also could use a few more marker counters, especially base-control markers, though Axis & Allies markers work well.)

I've played several turns, and it seems that it's easy to lose carriers due to the fluke of the dice. Also, I'm not usually a fan of games where one side has an overwhelming majority, and the other is trying to simply slow them down as they get butchered.

Excellent little mag-graduate game.  It manages to squeeze an incredible amount of horsepower out of 200 counters and a map.  Rules run to about 19 pages, require a couple of passes to get it right.  Hurt only by a fairly long playing time (5-7 hours).

Updated 2018. 9 down to 6. Does the island hopping well, but the India/Singapora/Burma bit of the game doesn't grab me. Really not the systems best bits. The island hopping is good, but the scale of the game is such that there's only very few paths to victory.
The combat is buckets of dice but the weird bit is air to air kills don't factor in.
Seems a few weird abstractions, and these days this is too long in terms of time for the enjoyment we got out of it.
---
Pacific war in 8-12 hours. Simple mechanics and easy to play.
Battles are buckets'o'dice but still have some tension - will my CAP fend off the attackers?.. no!. will the bombs hit..? no! hurrah!
Reinforcements are quite scripted and the start of the game can be bad for the Japanese (hence the tournament game starting on T2 after Pearl)

Many happy hours playing this one. It's one of the playable pacific games.

Rating après 1 partie jouée.

Le jeu semble réaliste historiquement et peut probablement mener à des parties intéressantes mais j'ai quelques critiques :
- le jeu, surtout pour des novices, reste trop long (en 6 heures, nous n'avons complété que 4 tours de jeu). La durée provient également du caractère peu intuitif des règles
- nous avons beaucoup bataillé avec les règles, qui sont assez peu intuitives.
- de même, certains aspects des règles sont réellement alambiqués et le jeu en devient trop procédural. Ainsi, les combats sont assez interminables et doivent suivre une procédure très précise pour être compris.

En résumé, le jeu me paraît très historique mais pas très "fun".

Il reste également trop long pour mes critères.

par contre, il est possible d'y jouer en solo

Fire in the Sky has the potential to be the logistics wargame I always wanted from Pacific War. Fire in the Sky is one of the few games along with ASL, Hannibal, Wilderness War and Pax Romana that I really wanted to get my hands on.
--
System is remarkably fresh take in the wargaming world. I have to say that I like every aspect individually so far but how they connect together requires more exposure.

I can appreciate the following the game has based on the experiments. Fire in the Sky does force one to think very very carefully yet dynamically. 
--
It plays very well indeed. Fine nuances, and logistics dilemmas to resolve. However, I can understand why people do not like it. Tension is not the same kind as, say in Hannibal, Wilderness War or ASL. 

Different breed entirely. More subtle, more nuanced and - at times, devious indeed. To describe it would be like forcing one to play with open hand yet bluff.

This turns out to be a superb little gem with all the elements that make the feel work so well for a pacific theater game that doesn't undertake to be so detailed you spend weeks playing it. 

The mechanics of play was pretty unusual to me, so the learning curve has been a little steep for this old gamer. But the system functions extraordinarily well. 

The game relies on costs in transport and oil (the oil for the japanese only) to move units about the board. This is mostly a naval/(air) strategic game, so a lot of the land combat is very abstracted. The system works with three separate movement phases... a strategic movement (deploy), an operational (combat) and a second strategic movement (deployment) phase. 

Most of the action happens during the operational phase, when ships strike at enemy bases. Submarines play into this, then air combat (which itself does not kill the air power) followed by the surface combat if any (apply damage), and amphibious invasions, finally land combat. Damaged ships come back in twice as many turns as the hits on them (a truly big deal because it's only a  16 turn game).

The whole play revolves around the Japanese making a huge effort to maintain economy of force to save on resource expenditure, and the Allies trying to minimize Japanese expansion until they have sufficient force to start pushing back. At that point, the Japanese have to go into a defensive mode. The Allies will have overwhelming force by the end of the game, and can clearly afford to fight a war of attrition to take down the Japanese at every turn.

The victory conditions are two fold, either an instant Japanese win by reaching 20 victory points, or holding onto at least 1 victory point to the end of the game. A knockout strategy calls for some very harsh risks, and the hold out strategy calls for tough tenacious play, knowing when to switch from offensive to defensive smoothly without any hitches. 

The game does emphasize the Carriers and Air Power very well, but does not reduce the importance of surface naval power. Surface sea power is easily as critical to making successful invasions and the battles that come of it really do matter to the outcome of the game. 

There is a lot of very detailed subtlety in the game that appear only to be learned after much replay... and it seems to me from the 4-5 plays I've put in so far that there's a huge amount of replay in this title.

It appears this game can be played in 4-6 hours between experienced players which makes it a very good game for an evening, and because it's not a trivial treatment of the war, it's a fantastic game for that however long it takes to play.

This title could turn out to be a sleeper that becomes one of the huge favorites on the subject matter, and a long term classic with a fair number of reprints in the future.

I'm even contemplating picking up a second copy for when my first copy wears out.

FitS takes a fresh approach to WW2 in the Pacific.  Some mechanics that are not complicated, but are a bit odd and take a little getting used to.  Massive emphasis for both sides on logistics (you have to use transport to set up your naval forces) and for Japan on oil.  Outstanding game, a real pleasure.

This is an extremely beautiful game, which simulates the Pacific War in extremely abstract terms.  The mechanics are very unique, and as such many will find them unfamiliar.  This results in a steep learning curve.  The rulebook is clear, however there are some instances which arise in play which I found difficult to resolve using just the rulebook.  This is a only a minor drawback, however.  This game elegantly illustrates how each side faced different problems during the Pacific War.  This flavor undoubtedly enhances the replay value of the game.  Furthermore, the player is not forced to deal with the minutiea which bog down other PacWar consims.

This is one of the oddest games in wargaming history, which is not saying to much as wargaming is a conservative business.

Such as thinking in terms of zoc's when defending the pacific. I would prefer Victory in the Pacific every day of the week.

I really like the theme. But the graphic design and gameplay are pretty messy. There's a game somewhere in there, but what they published feels more like a prototype.

RATING: 5
Place workers, collect sets, cash them in for tiles to fill a space on your player board.  Played with three and not only did there seem an absence of interesting decisions, but there were too many slots on the cluttered board for the worker placement to generate much real tension.  

I found the thirties pastiche artwork quite pleasing and production quality is good.

Play Test of substantially developed prototype.

You play the editor of a specialist newspaper (Finance, sports, etc) with the goal of filling the pages with reports and features. A worker placement mechanism drives the ability to collect card sets to create columns of various lengths with bonuses offered for complying with your unique journalistic angle.

The game offers a short (one page) and long (two page) option which is a neat twist depending on time constraints. I liked the player interaction and screwage oportunities. Players who prefer a kinder gaming attitude may not.

Now with Mayfair and to be published in 2015. Final playtest and looking good.

This layers worker placement and frills onto the card collection of mechanic of the 1953 game Scoop! It loses the latter's hilarious editor telephone, but becomes more strategic and less random. The ability to spend (scarce) money to bump another player off a desired location (and for that player to spend even more to bump back) makes for an intensely competitive game with larger numbers (5+).

As a journalist I was extremely happy in 2015, since two games with that theme came out. They are both excellent games with amazing artwork (though the money in Extra! Extra! are horrible) and they are both amongst my favorite games of all time. I still prefer Penny Press, but Extra! Extra! is also great. It feels thematic, the scenarios are amazing and my only concern is that the bidding phase can drag long.

Good game 

,,,,but production quality respectfully left room for improvement (size of the money, and ability to to scan the board for placement spots).  Price at $60 is poss. too high.

Experienced players may benefit from knowing how to leverage some of the less obvious placement options.

Played well with 4.

RATING: 7.4
Played 5p. The right amount of player interaction for me, although two players bidding for the same spots can slow the game down for those not involved. One round there were no contested spots which came as a relief for everyone! Verdict: a keeper.

RATING: 6
It's worker placement with set collection and a puzzle board as a newspaper layout. There's decent use of theme throughout and plenty of variability in the use and usefulness of worker spaces, plays best with at least 4 or more. With fewer players it's a short boring race. I like the use of money to protect spaces. I wish the board was in one piece.

I'll probably leave this unrated until it's published but the have enjoyed the play tests. The game is well executed and I think the strong theme probably gives it the potential of being a gateway game.

Plays well with five. I'm even less impressed with the Mayfair production values after my second play.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

As is typical of Mayfair, they didn't do themselves much favor in the design/art for the game which was somewhat ugly and disappointing. Par for the course for Mayfair I suppose. The game play was interesting with the worker placement where one could kick people out by paying more money. Considering money is fairly tight, one had to pick and choose which battles to fight. There is also a spatial component with putting together the newspaper (and the different articles are situated in a certain direction and must be placed that way unless one takes the typesetting action).

A worker placement game that tries to cram too many moving parts into a single engine. There's nothing particularly engaging here, and there are just way too many options for the amount of workers available. Also, the three decks don't feel very distinguished, but supposedly they are balanced in some way to offer different sets of cards. Overall, just a very disappointing experience. I was really hoping that this would be the definitive newspaper-themed game, but it falls pretty short of the mark. Horrible production values, too.

Gioco sull'editoria. Grafica curata come solo i migliori Splotter, fosse stato uno Splotter staremmo gridando al miracolo e gli avremmo consegnato già dei premi accusando i detrattori di non averlo capito. Sfortunatamente la casa editrice è la Mayfair e quindi i più potranno convenire liberamente che siamo di fronte ad un 'vorrei ma non posso' con alcune scelte grafiche e altre scelte meccaniche discutibili anche se non mancano spunti veramente interessanti e il tentativo di ambientazione gradevole. Purtroppo però penso che il gioco sarà destinato all'anonimato, dico purtroppo perché tutto sommato ci trovo anche aspetti gradevoli e dinamiche carine ma gli manca qualche cosa.

[b]Funny Story mini expansion rules:[/b]
Tiles (A side up) are shuffled in with the rest of the story tiles of the appropriate matching size

When you activate a reporter on a story space, you may claim a funny story tile if one is available. To do so, you must spend the mix of copy/photo icons shown on the funny story tile PLUS one Cartoon Card (to match the Cartoon icon). Apart from this, funny story tiles are handled exactly like standard story tiles in all other respects.

Phase 8: End of Round - One ONLY funny story tile of each size (3 and 4) may be available at any one time. If a second funny story tile of the size size is draw, discard it. This rule also applies during setup

I'd been following the design blog for this game for quite a while and though I wasn't certain it was really for me, I was intrigued to try it out.

Unfortunately, it fell very flat for me - and at least two of the other people at the table. We played scenario 4 - the Berliner - in about 60 minutes with the full rules, but none of the choices in the game felt interesting or challenging. The bidding mechanism is vaguely interesting, and delivered a few chances to mess with people's plans - but everything felt very undercooked here - along with a very cluttered design that screamed of late stage prototype awaiting a graphic design overhaul. The theme was also entirely lost - there was some colour set collection and a place to pay them in to take shapes to fill out my 'front page'. That I put adverts all across the top of my paper didn't seem to have any negative effects and I was glad when the game came to an end.

Kind of worker placement-Princes of Florence. Kinda.

A clear three part board ([b]have we heard of folding boards, Mayfair?[/b]) allows worker placement with money added to block or displace, while card matching (or unmatching) gets stories to place in tile-fitting fashion on the place board.

The layout is rather too big ([b]heard of 30" tables, Mayfair?[/b]) The money is too small to be legible (but you can probably get by treating everything as $100 tokens). The diagonal cuts for clippings are haphazard ([b]Mayfair?![/b]).

The game play seems to be good, though I can't imagine the pain of learning it from a rule book, but the game seems sound.

(One play against several experienced players; close second.)

Ok for the game, but the German player will have strong difficulties to duplicate the five successive historical offensives because of a very strong atrition

Ted Raicer WW1 again - this time the German spring offensive of 1918. Plays very quickly but seems very weighted against the Germans. Very difficult to make any sort of breakthrough even close to history. Nice simple mechanics and can be played out in an evening.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Some more playtesting required. As soon as the game kicks off the game turns too much fluid for a WWI, specially for the allied player. The German will break the front and bleed down in the process, but then the Allied can unrealistically trade space for hunting and enveloping the German spearheads and win the game at leisure.

Kaiserchacht 1918. 

Stoss, tanks, air support, Big Berta, Artillery Group Bruchmuller, trenches, infiltration tactics ....
One of the first hex & counter I have played.
Very good hex&counter game. Simple mechanics.
The Combat Table it's unforgettable!
I think the first game of the father of Paths of Glory with strong help from Ty Bomba. Fun, tense and bloody. The birth of a legend.

One of Commands better ones. It didn't capture the events of 1918 wholly, since the Germans launched in autumn 1918 three major offensives on three different locations on three different points in time by surprise.

In 1918: SitW you usually place all your stosstruppen on one place in the front - the British sector is the most likely candidate - and let's go for it. Besides there is not much to gain when the French breakthrough in their sector since there aren't much cities to gain and there aren't any consequences when the French reaches the eastern mapboard. Also high odds attacks - at least 5:1 - are needed in order to achieve success.

However I did enjoy the game. It's not unnecessary difficult and have some clever mechanics suchs as infiltration movement, the double combat phase and locked-in- zone-of-controls.

Ted Raicer impressed me with this game. Clean, simple, fast playing and tense. Extremely good value for a magazine game. Certainly better than 95% of wargames which are published in a box.

In fact it was so good I mounted it on old AH boards I still have in stock. Excellent game for a magazine, up there with magazine blockbusters like Panzergruppe Guderian and Ney vs Wellington.

RATING: 6.2
Enjoyed Ted R's debut as soon to be master of WWI; glad to get a relatively simple 1918 west single map game that wasn't a usual dry/clogged 90s S&T rendition.  But for some reason I was really turned off by the components this time around.  Heavy black unit symbols were annoying to me, Brit color red was jarring, and sand map was flat.  I am a big color freak/primary color fan, but it didn't work here.  

I even played the 1919 variant, which was okay.  But in the end, my overall take is an odd mix of enjoying the subject, but being turned off by Command graphics, which were usually solid to excellent.

Classic Ted Raicer/Command magazine game.  This game explores the 1918 German offensive using Stoss troops in an effort to shatter the front open and end the war quickly.  A hard to find classic.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is one great game!I played it  a lot, from both perspectives it is a real challenge. Usually I gathered all my stosstruppen in one great bunch and had a go at either the French (between Reims and Verdun) or the British (anywhere, but Ypres is a plum) or both (right there in the middle and aim for Paris). And yes, there were times I reached Paris or when my opponent folded beacause of losses suffered. If the first offensive failed, you could not hold out of course, so I always wondered what the Plan 1919 varatnt was for.But a friend of mine (well, actually ...) showed me a better way. Just make sure you capture Verdun and then let the Allies come on. They have so few infiltration capable troops, even after receiving all reinforcements, that near full strength Germans can easily repulse or slow them so that they will win in the long run! If only I had thought of that.And now I even get to use the Fuller Plan alternative. Oh boy, my cup runneth over ...

Really nice game.  Have played it enough to see games that actually mirrored the historical campaign.  That is a higher compliment than it sounds.  There is no iron-maiden rule forcing the players to imitate history, it is just that the historic decisions can make proper sense in game terms.

Clean, tight rules.  If all wargame rules were this well-written and developed I'd be a happy man.  

Interesting system, with a little more tactical nuance than is obvious at first glance.  However, from a strategic standpoint, there are few options.  As the Germans you must decide on a plan and an axis of attack from the very start, and you will not enjoy the flexibility to deviate.  Pick the spot you want to hit, aim your army, and slug away.

Map is functional but not really attractive.  It looks better with the counters on it, which are visually dominant, with bold colors, fonts, and symbols.  I do like the counters.  

This review probably sounds more negative than it should.  For a magazine game, this one is a gem, and (I believe) was also Ted R.'s first published design.  Clean rules, good system, just not a lot of replayability.

This is essentially a what-if game as Raicer correctly believes that the German plan for victory in 1918 was doomed to failure. Options are wide open and both sides have major difficulties to overcome. Given the scale the battles usually come down to making attacks at high odds. I think a tactical treatment of any of the battles that occurred in 1918 would be more fun but this is still a good game.

As a game it's ok; as a historical simulation, well... I understand the meaning of letting Stosstruppen infiltrate without regard of Enemy ZOCs (the key to an interesting game) but the results are not real. Von Below, Von der Marwitz and Von Hutier's armies did not even take Amiens in real life; in my game I reached the outskirts of Paris only to be stopped by American reinforcements.
I will try again with a home rule, ignore the first hex in EZOC during infiltration, but no more

Reviewer comments from Perfidious Albion #81/82: "Well presented, well written, clearly mapped but unsatisfying. the essence of the campaign seemed to be missing as the Allies simply pulled back blocking the attritioning Germans in an exercise of defensive play which once learned is not very interesting and in no way simulates the worry to be found in Allied HQs. [...] As a game it is a good basic exercise in bulding and breaking positions, but I was mightily reminded of SPI in the late seventies."

This game started me off with the whole wide world of WAR GAMES(grognard style), complete with chit counters, hexes and a somewhat more detailed rule set than what I was used to. I've been wanting to table this again and get back into some WW1 trench warfare. Germany has its units released after the collapse of Imperial Russia. They only have a limited time to deploy them and force a victory over the western powers before the United States gets mobilized and arrives in force on the Western Front. Last great German offensive of the war.

I played this game seven times and each time the Allies won.
The game is fun to play as both sides get a chance to go on the offensive, but since the Germans attack first, it is the Allies' offensive that wins the game.

OK war game about WW1.  The game has two parts.  In the first part, the Germans have to hit the Allies so hard that they drive the Allied morale down to zero.  If they don't do that by turn 9, then game then switches to having the Germans survive an American onslaught and simply survive until the game ends.  The game has some interesting mechanics.  Combat is very deadly for attackers (duh, it's trench warfare).  Normally, you want to increase the odds as much as possible, but in this game that also drives up the attacker's casualties more than might be necessary.

RATING: 7
A solid treatment of the 1918 campaign, fun and playable. One of the better Command games, and more historically balanced than the designer's more ambitious All Quiet on the Western Front, which heavily favours the Germans. 1918: SitW, in my experience, is more likely to lead to historical outcomes.

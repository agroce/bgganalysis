GAME: Magic: The Gathering
RANK: 156

RATING: 10
One of the best games ever. 

Almost all of the criticism I hear about Magic is that it costs too much. But really, it only costs what you want you want to spend on it. You can get a longbox of commons for $10 and be set... if you have discipline - and if you don't, that's your problem not the game's.

50+ plays. I don't play anymore and haven't for years but I still hold this in very high regard. Despite all the issues around balance and some fiddly rules it was just a great gaming experience and such a fabulous concept.

The classic game. I haven't played this since the 1990s and I am okay with that. I can't imagine the average board gamer wanting to play this type of game.

The one and only true CCG/TCG...for me anyway. I don't play the tournaments anymore, but still have a few decks that seem to hold their own against just about anything that has come out recently. !!!WARNING!!! this game can get expensive quickly especially if you would consider yourself a "collector".

RATING: 7
Six years of Magic made me immune to any and all kinds of deckbuilding, LCG/TCG,CCG... "board"games today. Take your Netrunners and Dominions and 7 Wonders and Smash Ups with you.
That itch has been scratched for me. 
Now when i get together with multiple people i prefer games with more inherent communication.

2008: My FLGS gave me two 10th Edition Core Sets for free. They felt very much like 'beginner sets' but I enjoyed my first three games with the 'Cho-Manno's Resolve' deck. 

2010: Bought a selection of "Thematic" ready to play decks. But I suspect I will need more cards to really get the best from this game. Great game, but to me the collectability aspect is just bothersome and plainly stupid.

2013: Got into Magic again. This time during the release of M14 and the Theros set. Got into limited and drafting formats and really found a new love for the game. Expensive but still a lovely game.

I have most of the Ravnica block cards, Coldsnap and some of the TimeSpiral set cards with 8th to 10th editions thrown in.  I keep 8 ready to play decks and have a binder of rares for trade.

I don't play actively any more but used to go to Friday Night Magic Tournaments every Friday during the Ravnica to TimeSpiral time period.

A world and a lifestyle rather than a game, it could be argued. I am more into games that aren't quite as much of a project nowadays, though, but I have to give Magic a 10 for the 20+ years of fun it's meant for me, for being so extremely innovative (people bring their own game pieces and sometimes you might not even have seen some of the cards in your opponents deck) and vast (aproaching 20 000 cards now, I'd guess) and immersive.

RATING: N/A
I really don't know what to rate this game. I've played it for many years now, and loved it all that time, except that, for the past few months, I have stopped buying cards and playing it. Now it almost disgusts me to see my giant drawer full of all my cards. It is truly terrible that whoever spends the most money on cards usually wins. I have had  recurring lapses of this feeling before, but it never really has hit me like it has now. However, anyone who likes playing the game in general, should try playing in a sealed deck tournament, which is really the only fair way to play, and it can be a lot of fun. 
The main reason I stopped playing (which isn't neccessarily a permanent decision) is that whenever I played, I would just get in a big argument with my friend who was playing with me about what certain cards could and couldn't do, making the game just no fun anymore. Also, I felt the new cards were spinning out of control a bit in terms of how radically unfair they were. Some of my friends feel the newest expansions destroyed the game. I don't quite think that, but that it probably because I found the Japanese theme intruiging.
I am not rating the game, because I would not rate it too highly, as that would be promoting the almost criminal way Wizards of the Coast can keep printing more and more good cards so fast (couldn't they stop at some point?), but I wouldn't rate it too badly, because, after all, I really like the general idea of the game, and it has given me tons of hours of fun.

The theme, art, and mechanics are amazing!  So why the low rating?  Because here's the breakdown on winning at this game:
6% luck
11% skill
83% how much money you spend building a deck!
CCGs and TCGs suck!  I hate being blown out because someone else spent more money.  Terrible game!

I played this game non stop for 10 years. Its the game I've spent by far the most time playing. I still like it now and only rate it this low because there are many games I would rather play now, not because they are better but due to the huge number of games I've played.

Started playing in 1994, gave up collecting sometime after Urza's block and got back into it right before New Phyrexia hit.
Loads of depth and many game types to choose from, but expect to pay to play as crafting competitive decks can get pricy fast. Very few games retain their value like M:tG though and acquiring certain cards could even be seen as an investment.

I've put off rating this for...I dunno, forever.  I'm not sure why.  It is the game--THE game--that defined most of my early gaming life.  Magic and role-playing games.  Reapproaching Magic after several years of absence, and teaching Mickie, reminds me again of how brilliant the game is.  Why play something like Lost Cities when you could play Magic?  I don't understand why this isn't universally considered one of the best 2-player hobby games ever made.

I've cut the habbit of buying anymore MTG cards and agreed with all those gamers who rated the game "2" or below because it's a money pit.  But playing it as a family or casual game with the collections I've got (still more than 10 thousand cards) and not bounded by any tournament rules, it's still fun and appealing especially to those of my friends (mainly my students) who had never touched any CCG! That's why I rate it "5".

I recently started playing MTG again. I love doing booster drafts and playing Limited format. I use the cards I get to build my Constructed format decks. 
I think MTG is a lot of fun and has a high level of strategy, but it is not for most board gamers. MTG is almost an exclusive hobby and I find when I am playing MTG and buying cards I don't think about board games as much, and vice versa.
To anyong interested in trying this game I would recommend starting out getting a pre-made deck and learning the rules, and then doing booster drafts. That will supply you with a lot of cards for much cheaper than retail and you will increase in skill far more quickly.

A great classic game I used to play. The rules are simple, easy, and intuitive and the game is very deep, but it was too expensive to keep up with other players. If you and your opponent are on the same level though, it's a blast.

I want to try different casual drafting formats using my cards. I've already tried some and had a great time. I have 4 common sets and nearly 4 uncommon sets, all from 10th edition, plus a bunch of land. Got it all on eBay for around $20 (including shipping).

The newer sets are better in just about every way than the older ones. The cards are more balanced, the art is better, and the variety of cards is more interesting.

The grandfather of all CCGs. A true classic that I used to play a lot in my teens. Simple mechanics, literally thousands of interesting cards.. it's quite simply fast and fun. Haven't played much since 1997 or so, but I have a few old decks lying around somewhere that I used a lot of time, effort and money to build once upon a time..

A great game that I played a few years ago until I realised that the first cards I bought weren't allowed anymore and so you are forced to buy new ones. Welcome to the World of CCGs.

RATING: 10
An excellent, flexible, ever-changing game; the key to the longevity and popularity of the game is that the rules follow from the cards, and not the cards from the rules, as well as an excellent resource-limiting system. The game had serious development issues around the time I temporarily stopped playing (Urza's Saga, due to lack of time), but since the Invasion block, the game has been (for the most part) carefully designed and balanced. One should take care and do some research if they want to get into it now, because the addictive nature of the game can ruin the overall experience. 

The game has a steep learning curve which plateaus a few times, so it usually takes some time to get a hold on the theory involved with the game, both in deckbuilding and in actual play. Stick to casual play unless you have a good gaming group to test decks with and borrow cards from. Otherwise you'll quickly find yourself frustrated with the game (in other words, you'll spend more money at the game but won't improve in play skill or deck construction). I simply haven't seen anybody grasp higher-level play without a few months of practice.

2011-01-13 (rating 8):

I decreased the rating as I go more and more into games with tiny to non randomness.

2010-04-14 (rating 8.5):

The game is great and rich. It has countless ways of winning (through countless decks, numerous general tactics and so on). Also it has very good rules, precise and clear even thou there are lots of cards (or at least so it was around 8th edition).

Now I am not that much into CCGs and being a CCG is the main problem (for me) in this game.

Except for that it is simply brilliant although somewhat random. But a better player will generally win with worse one even if some games may be lost due to unlucky cards.

Il gioco che ha cambiato tutto. Ricordo quando uscì, io non avevo i soldi per acquistare tutte le buste che volevo. Seguivo però l'andamento delle carte, da Arabian Nights a Legends, Ice Age... facevo elenchi, conservavo e vendevo le rare, insomma ci ho passato ore e ore. Aprire le buste e le scatole di magic era una sensazione indescrivibile, quanto avrei voluto avere amici con cui giocarci! Poi dopo alcuni anni vendetti tutte le mie carte, ci ricavai abbastanza per i miei standard e me ne sono disinteressato. Non potendo star dietro alle uscite, per me ha perso ogni interesse.

Enjoyed playing this in middle school.  Had no idea it was still so popular until I got into board games.  I'm sure I would enjoy playing it, but the time and money commitment is prohibitive.  I'm not a lifestyle gamer I don't think; I'd much rather play a wide variety of games.

RATING: 6
A classic that was the rage of my former game group - and they were crazy for it, dumping hundreds (thousands?) of dollars and hundreds of hours in play. I've only played with them perhaps twice (and gotten completely crushed). However, just a bit ago I played with my daughter - we both were using a free deck from GenCon past - and we both kinda enjoyed it. It was alright - not wildly fun, but alright. So I'll be buying some more cards maybe. We'll see.

Began playing online, but didn't like that you can't build your own deck.

Bought a few starter decks and quickly found it to be an endless money sink. 

There is no sense getting in to this "game" unless you have a lot of spare cash and want thousands of useless cards.

I'll stick with the online versions.

While I no longer actively play this highly addicting game, I still have all my cards AND I WILL NEVER GET RID OF THEM.  They are a part of me now, and will never go away.

I started playing back in middle school, when a found a Sengir Vampire tucked into a Thieve's World book as a bookmark at the public library.  I was intrigued.  What game was this?  It is not surprising that I mainly play black.  However, I like mixed decks - so it is usually black plus another color.  Black and red is my favorite for a quick death, black and blue to taunt my opponent, black and green for some overpowered creatures, and black and white for some unholy rampaging.

I actively played all through high school, fading a little through college, until now, when my decks sit unused on my shelves.  (Though I still can't help but by a new pack every now and then, mostly to ogle the gorgeous artwork.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
What can I say? It's magic. Personally I think the way land is tapped for mana is a serious flaw of the game because you sometimes (too often) just get unlucky and can't get enough land because of the way your deck is shuffled. I also have a fundamental objection to games where you are able to 'pay to win' to any extent. Games should be 'PLAY to win'. Having said that, I have a lot of cards, and it is a very flexible game which works with almost any number of players and has many different variants! Also, if you learn to play Magic, you will be able to pick up almost any game and learn to play it quickly.

Haven't played in a long time. The part of the game which is most fun is deck construction which is not the social part. Deck construction is like lego: Fantastic possibility to create anything, however it is insanely frustrating to keep everything sorted, takes up too much space and it just creates a mess.

Solid game and solid mechanics, but the skill level of a player does differ dramatically with the cards they have. You could easily buy yourself into a winning position. However, some properly-made decks do allow for skilled players to outdo rich players.

Speaking of games that have really gone downhill from their original release ... back when I started playing during Unlimited, this would have been a 10.  At this point, though, there are so many cards that you can't predict your opponents' actions at all, and players resort to mindless "robot decks" that require no skill to play, only to build.  That's just not fun.  Starter deck play is still terrific, but my, that gets expensive fast ...

There was a time in my life where, when I wasn't playing Magic, I was thinking about decks. Oh, the hours I spent! We had a game club in town, and would play huge 15-person games. My first starter was Unlimited, when Antiquities was still on the shelves. And when I was trying to complete my set, I balked at the price for a Black Lotus. $12 for one card? Outrageous! I've never forgiven myself for that one. Both my kids play this with me, and I've still got about 28 decks together, though I haven't bought any new cards in the last couple years.

Easily my choice for the "if I could only ever play one game again what would it be" question.  And that would be true even if no new cards were released.  The basics are simple, the strategy is deep, and there are a million different ways to play.  Even though I consider myself more a boardgamer than a CCGer these days, for me Magic is still the king of games.

[2+] I remember going into B&N as a kid to check out the latest packs of cards and battling my friend every weekend.  This was back in 1996 and our decks were rooted in the classics of first three years of the game.  I ended up selling everything I had due to the time and money needed to keep this game up.  Also, I didn't have anyone to play with.  I do wish I kept a skeleton of my deck...

-----

Edit: I recently read an article on Cube Winston drafting and decided it was time to take a (limited) plunge back into the game.  Over the next couple of months I'll be putting together a small-ish cube based on a large used collection of commons/uncommons/rares.  I'm worried about my wife's reception to the game but I ironically think it'll have a better chance of hitting the table after her great relationship with Dominion...

The game is really good but i think the more important is that it lets you make new friend around the world by sharing the same passion. I think this is one of the only game i know that can do that.
money: this game cost some money, but if you manage your budget right it will not cost you too much. just don't start with "competitive" constructed first but with sealed and when you start to become better then you can try standard

An excellent game with balanced mechanics. Although the balance does come at the cost of getting the right cards (CCG format) and thus the money spent to seriously play the game is a huge downside. That being said, a good game if played casually, themed with the beautiful pictures and is felt during play that you are casting spells. Also the feeling of building your deck and playing it is most satisfying especially when it results in victory.

Played it a bit in 1995, so my memory if it is a bit rusty. I remember liking it, but figuring out early enough that I had no interest in buying in deeper. I watched my roommates play in law school years later, gained some more appreciation for it, and solidified my desire not to play it any more.

Magic: The Gathering is by far the best competitive card game I have played thus earning it a score of "10". The game has so much flavor and every person you play has a different play style which is unique. I've played Magic since I was in the 6th grade and it's never been boring. Although I haven't kept up with the recent sets released, my memories of M11 and Scars of Mirrodin are still fresh in my head.

I started playing on 1995 and have a lot of cards. Magic suffers from the same problem as Warhammer: it becomes an addiction and you find too much people playing not for fun but just for the sense of defeating others on a too agressive way. Although it's a better game than Warhammer, I won't recommend it.

RATING: 9
This game means so many different things to so many different people, it is almost impossible to give an accurate rating... It's a behemoth in the industry, and practically a society unto itself. Not only are there numerous formats for both constructed and limited play, there are variant and unofficial formats that wax and wane in popularity, local metagames, unofficial bannings and impromptu nerfs; to use a cliche term, there are millions of people who play Magic, and there is probably that many different ways to play the game.

I don't know if one can separate the game from the culture, media, and shared memories surrounding it. Some use the game as a way to experience the world that they read about in the books and comics, while others go to tournaments as an outlet for competition. For many it sparked that initial creative spark that led them to game design, not only through creating interesting decks, but also by making custom cards and formats.

My rating reflects both my genuine enjoyment with the core game itself, regardless of the ups and downs with whatever meta for a particular format, and the local community that I became a part of.

As a final note, the game is not "pay to win". A deck that just jams all of the most expensive cards will be trounced by a deck that has been tested and well-tuned. Hell, what is considered the best deck is often not even the most expensive, as seen in Legacy and Vintage. It does however require a substantial initial investment if you want to be tournament ready, so it can be called "Pay to compete". That initial investment can be maintained through aggressive buying, selling, and trading cards like stocks, but at that point you have to treat the game like a second part-time job. It is fine if people don't want to deal with he money/time investment to be competitive, but again, the game is not "P2W".

I played Magic as a life-style game for 4 years and I also used to do tournaments a lot. I even made it twice in Top8 at PTQs, but at some point I realised that I wasn't enjoying the game anymore. I was just competing and that sucked all the fun out of the hobby. At that point I stopped playing it and moved on to other things.

Now I see that Magic is a good game. It was absolutely innovative when it came out and we all have to be very grateful for what it did for our hobby. At this point instead I think it has too much luck involved and there are games that do the same thing better... also the business behind Magic is just sick. Good game, but thank God I'm over it.

The grade is for the intrinsic worth of the (at the table) game system, which isn't bad to an outsider like myself; if I tried to rate the experience including deck construction it would be quite a bit higher (I have almost no experience with it, but it looks intriguing).  I don't think a single neuron inside my head fires off at the prospect of being suckered into the collectible card game business model.

RATING: 7
Better than San Juan, but not as cheap.  Not as good a game, really, as RftG, Jambo, Glory to Rome, or Blue Moon.

Why?  It's not that, with knowledge of the rules and good decks, Magic is a bad game -- it's a quite extraordinary game, in that case.  The investment to become a competent Magic player, however, is massive, in both time and money.  I was up for that as an undergraduate, but didn't play any in grad school, and my wife isn't much on the game (though she thinks Lhurgoyf is cute).  So, the game has to suffer some ratings punishment for requiring (1) complete understanding of a rule-set that is almost ASL league, if you want to really do it right (and makes War of the Ring look like Hey, That's My Fish) and (2) a pretty huge money investment to produce variety and keep it going.

That said, people who think they can attain the fun of making your own decks by playing Dominion are deluding themselves.  These are not the same thing, at all.

Like many people I've spent a lot of time playing magic. I now only ever play it multiplayer with some mates and some home-cooked rules. I think it's lost a bit from the old days... and a slow but constant power creep has pretty much ruined my enjoyment of it. I enjoy making up decks more than the playing (they made some games about that haven't they 'dominion'). Oh, hang the expense... this is not a cheap game for its overall enjoyment.

It's amazing how many effects can be hung on such a simple engine to create such a huge variety of deck archetypes and play formats. I love reading about Type 1.

On the other hand it's collectible, full of cards that will never see play outside of draft (or in draft, for that matter), expensive, a little bit clunky and a lifestyle game.

Well a modern classic. I don't really like the idea of a collectible card game because I easily get the urge to buy new cards but with this game I have actually managed to restrict myself to the starter-decks. I have 3 pre-build decks now and that's enough I think.

I hate the collectable nature of the game but if you can get a good set of cards and ignore all the expansions and the collectability, it makes a wonderful game. It's fast, fairly easy to play and teach and offers plenty of decisions. I'm torn between really liking the game but not wanting to collect lots of cards and climbing the learning curve of learning all the cards. That's my biggest problem with the game. There are just waaayyyyyy too many cards. To get a handle on effective deck building you need to have and really understand thousands of cards. I enjoy playing other peoples decks when not playing my small set of cards or pregenerated decks. But actually building a deck is something I'll probably never bother with. But I can certainly see the appeal.

One of the funnest, most versatile and excitingly customizable card games I've ever played. The fantasy theme is enthralling; the mechanics are fluid and ever-changing; the skill, strategy and challenge involved in building decks remains one of my most favourite aspects of the game. Not to mention the card art is, very often, outstanding.
It does get very expensive though, so I've found most enjoyment in playing with close friend groups who agree to spend around $50 or less on each deck.
A longtime favourite of mine and will be forever.

Garfield has a mathematics PhD, but despite this, chose to make a game with some of the simplest and most easily solved core mechanics. This isn't surprising as he was inspired by poker in large part. While MtG is the first TCG, that doesn't automatically make it the best (or the worst). Numbers in the game aren't very good comparison percentages, which is surprising given Garfield's combinatorial mathematics degree. What I mean is Power 5 and Power 6 are great ratios (5 is ~83% of 6) and therefore represents good granularity, but the mana system forces both players to be approximately at the same level of "ramp" to experience this creature power ratio. This is entirely a byproduct of western TCG number systems where single-digit integers are favored. 

The ramp itself is a pure travesty. Yet another single-digit integer, but now with flavors (Black, Red etc) which are poorly compared ratios to each other. If you fall behind in ramp, almost always due to chance and rarely ever due to skill/deck at this point in the game, you pretty much just lose as you can't carry a midgame. If you open with mana screw (16.5%) or flood (~6% with standard land). Meaning you have a NON-overlapping hard probability of 22.5% to just be screwed. Depending on which flavor and if your opponent is too (~5% of total games), you may or may not be able to still win. If your opponent is not when you are screwed/flooded, which is the most probable, you take an auto loss. Not a problem for casual players but a huge and insurmountable problem for veterns who play in tournaments. 

Consider than Pro Tour qualified players automatically gain 3 bys to shove them past the opening three games of chaos and random chance because they know this and refuse to fix it. Mulligan in this game forces a -1 each time, which simply punishes the player who was unlucky. So ramp is the most important aspect of the game and yet is one hundred percent entirely chance based. Almost every single game based on MtG gets rid of this garbage (Force of Will lets you pick "land" and Epic Card Game gives you 1 gold to spend each player's turn, with all the best cards costing exactly 1 gold). 

Creatures themselves overpower the game dauntingly. Without constant tempo cards like kill spells and board wipes, creatures simply always win as is evidenced by every tournament ever. Most games that choose a creature-dominant meta simply get rid of non-creatures (Cardfight Vanguard) or make spells/events more powerful and flexible (Epic Card Game, WIXOSS). Top players all agree this game is played with your opening hand and whether you actually draw land at a 1/3 ratio for the next four-five turns. The battle system is so awful it devolves into a game of Chicken (see: Game Theory, something Garfield should've been familiar with) even as early as the original Alpha set. This problem has never gone away and creature battles quickly turn into a cold war until someone breaks or plays removal/lock. 

The stack is a horribly confusing concept most modern games have gotten rid of entirely in favor if a proper initial design and more conservative card effects (EPIC again, Star Realms, Vanguard, Netrunner—his second game, etc). The continued inclusion of overly-inflated complexity in magic detracts from its long-term viability as a good game. 

The eternal formats are frozen forever in time, with legacy never changing, modern changing mildly about once a year and then you have standard which invalidates all your card purchases every so often just to kick you in the teeth. Despite this fact, Wizards refuses to reprint popular and necessary cards for their eternal formats, causing interest to steadily decline over the last decade due to inflated and unobtainable prices. Even their more approachable formats like EDH (or their marketing rebrand "Commander") are dressed up as casual fun times to get together with friends, when really it's almost as bad as legacy due to having no proper ban list. Which wouldn't be important if it were a casual format except Commander has TOURNAMENTS. 

Richard's failure on every level to deliver a mathematically sound or satisfying game is only trumped by Wizard's complete failure to understand its fans and deliver a good product without destroying wallets.

I play this online and purchase online cards for my collection also. I refuse to buy the cardboard version apart from the bulk cards I purchased when I first got into the game.

Don't know what the hype for this game is. After trying some CCG for a while, including this, I need to back out of CCG altogether. The reason is, it is a money making scheme from the manufacturer. Plus, if you want to be good at tournment, you need to pump money into it. Plus, the game keeps updating every 3 months, and whoever has the best card or willing to spend the most money in it wins. Cannot afford the time and money on this game, plus it never picks up from my 12 year old Son...

Magic is a lot of fun. Jeff and I used to run and judge tourneys such as Prereleases and States. Building decks is also fun. My favorite format is multiplayer "fatty," with decks of over 200 cards. Mine currently has just over 1300 (it's hard to keep the number down!), and is red, white, and blue, with lots of artifacts for good measure.

RATING: 10
Rating is for game design, quality of components, depth of play.  Is NOT commentary on tournament scene, "net decks," or individual sets or cards.

My first introduction to "real" gaming, back in 94.  Revolutionary concept.  I loved the game, played it daily, spent hours deck building every week, etc.  I blissfully ignored the money-grubbing tactics of WotC (Type 2?  You mean, I HAVE to buy new cards to play in tourneys?), played T1 games with my friends, etc.  I even bought several boxes of each set, although I only played with MAYBE 5% of the cards.

Then, WotC went one step too far, and lost a customer.  I sold my 15,000 card collection (Alpha through Urza's Saga or whatever).  Why?  

FOIL CARDS.




A few years later, I acquired a few collections, and have ~25,000 cards now.  I rarely play with them, and have no intention of buying any new cards.  The gameplay, artwork, and just game design is just too good, I wanted to at least have the option of playing in the future...especially with my kids.

RATING: 8.5
One of the few games that actually supports the concept of "strategy", by allowing you to decide exactly how you want to go about fighting. It allows an immense range of creativity and planning, while still leaving your eventual fate up to a bit of luck and tactical skill.

Possibly, among all the clones and competitors there is a better game, but I have not played any of them.

Personally, I'm happy to build decks out of a static pool of a few hundred cards. I don't see any value in constantly purchasing booster packs and new sets. The financial complaint that many have against the game seems to be more an issue of them, than the game. Getting into an arms race of finding bigger and better cards is a pointless exercise. The game is fun when you have two decks that are competitive with one another, not when you have a deck that can wallop all other decks, and you can make paired decks with any starting set of cards to choose from.

The principal issue with the game is really one that there's an intrinsic issue with a game that allows creativity, comboing, and synergies. In one deck, a card might be worth 1 mana. In another deck, that same card might be worth 10 mana. In actuality, it might be priced as 4 mana. It's fundamentally impossible to assign an accurate price to any card, and this makes it impossible to compare decks to one another through any other means than dueling a few dozen times. And, of course, it drives the engine that propels people on the spending frenzy to find cards which are underpriced in mana compared to their strength in game.

I doubt that this problem has been solved by any other Magic-like game, except by making cards with powers that are non-creative and purely additive. And that's just not interesting. But so I don't feel like there's value in trying other games of the same type. You may as well stick to Magic as it has the most variety available, and the largest player base.

I started playing in Alpha. Took a break after The Dark. Finally got back into it a few years ago with 8th Edition. Great filler. I don't do serious deck construction, mostly use the pre-built decks and some random boosters in mock drafts. Without qualification, the best gameplay of any CCG I've ever played.

Brilliant card game that I have thrown too much money at.  Don't really feel like throwing more nowadays - instead it goes towards Netrunner.  Whoops.

RATING: 7
while I am no longer purchasing or trying to play, I will still play someone else's cards. The best way I can put it is that the actual game play varies so much on the card quality in the deck, and since this is a collectible game, more money makes better games, and the alternative sealed options are a nice level field....forever held at a quality below the constructed formats.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This is one of my all time favourite games. The only problem with MtG is that it cost you a lot of money. The game is like a shark. It needs to move forward constantly otherwise it would stop working. If they stopped giving out new cards an optimal tactics would soon appear I think and it wouldn't be so fun anymore. Because it's a dynamic game you have to spend a lot of time and energy staying up to date with all the new cards that are coming out.

What can I say, Magic was my obsession for the majority of my life now. The game captured my imagination at a young age and has never lost me. I've spent more years playing magic than not. Its the one, only, and king of the card games. It's place in history has been firmly cemented, as game trends, fads, and cult of the news come and go Magic stays strong. Nuff' said.

Best fantasy card game... perfect for travel. Just don't fall for the collectibility aspect. Just buy ONE theme deck and have both players draw from the same deck. Then you have an excellent game for two, on par with cosmos 2 player games, and you only spent $10! (Get the instructions free off thier website) Great mechanics and oozing with theme. If you like fantasy novels, you'll love this game. Beautiful artwork too. Very addictive.

This has been the most mind boggling game I have encountered.  On the surface it looks so simple but pretty heavy strategy lies with since you have so many combination of card possibility.  Granted you will spend a lot to play competitive.  However, a lot of players are missing the point since this is also a Trading game and you can trade away stuff you don't need for stuff that helps your deck.  I was lucky in recognizing the new trend when it came out and jumped in immediately.  No other CCG plays as well as this game.

I played a starter set with my GF years before. We were both unimpressed. Recently a friend mentioned that he'd like to sell his cards. I asked to borrow them to see if I'd change my mind about the game and buy them. He dropped off around 3000 cards. Another MTG experienced friend and I built decks to dual. He got elaborate, and his schemes fell trough with the bad luck draws. I made a deck full of heavy hitters. It was easy to deal damage. There was little luck involved, but the cards played themselves. I have to admit that I wanted to play the game so I might get some help on creative projects from the cocky kids who spend all day at the game hall. That's all they play there. They used to play HeroClix too, but I'm told the kids who played that got summer jobs. Yes, it would have been nice to have cocky rich kids with free time helping me out, but MTG doesn't feel like a game to me. I'd much rather play Carcassonne, Dominion, or even Talisman.

Talk about late to the party.  We bought a bunch of Eventide theme decks and learned the rules in minutes.  A couple of guys in our group got hooked into full-blown addiction almost instantly.  It really is a fun game, with deck building being a whole 'nother activity itself.  I enjoy it, but I have to say I don't have much interest in keeping up with the treadmill of new releases.  The art work on the latest stuff is fantastic though, that's for sure.

Only have the Monsters vs Heroes duel deck, so everything I say is from that point of view. It's an interesting game. I sort of wonder if the mechanics are done a bit better by Marvel Dice Masters, of all things (I know that Magic was first). All in all, I like having the two premade decks and don't feel any desire to get any deeper.

I'll play if any of my freinds want to, but they don't want to and neither do I because it just makes me want to spend money on more cards.  its an addiction.

I could talk for hours about this game who turned me into the hardcore gamer I'm now, who made me cross an ocean to play a tournament, who got me a dream job (not for long alas) and most of all, who brought me my friends. I owe so much to this game that I can honestly say it changed my life, not something you can say often about anything. 

The deckbulding is deep (albeit a bit killed by the internetas far as i'm concerned), limited play requires so much skill and the actual playing requires another set of skills. A fantastic game that I regret pratically not playing any longer due to a lack of time for the investment it requires.

Hours dicussing picks in a draft, slot in a deck or a card potential in general, good times.

I turned to the boardgames to replace it when I no longer had the time to play it (oddly enough it coincides with the arrival of the children, maybe there's a link?).

Forever special to me.

PLaying again, got back thanks to cubedrafting.

In the old days I loved this game and would have rated it 9.5. The game used to have flavour, and player skill was greater than it is now.

I rediscovered this excellent game with the Khans of Tarkir set after a very, very long absence. I don't think I'll ever play the constructed formats, but I've found draft to be incredibly fun - including the two-player Winston Draft. I've also enjoyed cube draft and sealed and I've since sunk a fair bit of money to assemble my own self-contained set of magic cards to use purely for these purposes. Playing MtG limited and casual has saved a game I had thought was ruined. I'll shortly be trying out commander too.

I was into MTG in the 90's, but any collectible game is against my principles. I stopped buying cards after Revised Edition turned the table on card prices. However, the game itself and all the game mechanics are simply awesome! Would probably rate this 10 if it wasn't CCG...

Great collectable card game. Biggest fault is its best feature in that there are so many cards. It can get expensive to keep up with expansions.

Impossible to rate this game. I played it from the second edition, long ago, to more recent expansions. I really liked the game, especially the deck building part. But the commercial mechanics (you have to always buy new expansions to stay "in the race") killed the game for me.

I played from Revised up through Shards. The game is incredible, and the community that has risen up around it is great. You could always play a net deck if you were feeling uninspired, but nothing to me was more satisfying than coming up with your own deck and crushing your friends, especially in some janky way. So if it is so great, why did I get rid of it? Honestly it was the money sink, which is a hazard with any CCG (or hobby in general I suppose). I found myself paying more and more and playing less and less. As IRL people kept falling off the wayside of playing this game, I turned to Magic Online, but I would continually find myself playing jerks - they either taunt you when they are winning or they gripe continually of you being a "lucksack" if they were losing and then timing out their connection. I just found myself having no fun playing anymore, so I had to let it go. Every once in a while I check in on the state of the game, and it makes me want to start playing again, but that ship has sailed.

Well, back when this first came out I picked up two starter decks (for me and my sister) to have a bash at. Bugger me if we did not get about 10 of our friends in to this game as a result. I have never played club or tournament games. This is a game among friends. It is a blast, easy to learn but hard to master game that can last up to about 20 minutes or so. 

The collectible aspect is appealing to me since I enjoy that sort of thing. But for many folks, the randomness of the boosters is a pain in the tail. Having said that, this game is worth playing and worth investing in providing you have a the very least 1 or 2 friends to play with :)

You must ask "why this guy don´t recommend to buy magic if he rates it in a so highlevel (9)?". 

The first Magic the game with its first game rules is awsome. The ethernal expansion decks has turned a game to play with friends into a professional sport, and a vicious. I knew many people who is/were addicted by Magic. You are never satisfied with your own cards, Players aren´t just friends but contestants, and because of this, I bannned magic of my list of games.

If you want to open a completely new deck for me and for you, and calls me to play with no other pretension, so I will play!

Peasant/pauper formats are where it's AT!

Update: For under $50 (including shipping), I netted complete common sets for Lorwyn, Morningtide, Shadowmoor, and Eventide. In eliminating the collectible aspect and balance issues between sets by purchasing a whole block's worth of cards to use as a common card pool for all players, I've fallen head over heels for Magic again. I like the Lorwyn/Shadowmoor block best, too, with its storybook fantasy setting and the tribal nature of the cards - you get Faerie decks, Goblins, Giants, Treefolk, Merfolk, Elves, Elementals, etc., so the theme even feels a lot more cohesive. 

By the way, my black Rogues deck will destroy you.

[ESP] Magic, que nostalgia.
Cuando comencé a salir con mi esposo descubrimos Magic y nos encantó. Nos pusimos medio adictos y cada cierto tiempo comprabamos nuevas cartas.
Es un gran juego, está bien diseñado. En esa época claramente le habría puesto un 9 o 10. Pero con el pasar del tiempo, el crecimiento de mi ludoteca y los años que tengo encima ha bajado su nota ya que prefiero otros juegos. Creo que mi esposo en cambio seguirá pensando en él como un 9 o 10.
Siempre le tendré cariño, razón por la cual aún conservamos los mazos y las miles de cartas adicionales en carpetas.

I used to play this a bit about a decade ago, then I realized that paying anything more than a few cents for a piece of card stock with a picture of a dragon on it is outrageous.  Apart from sealed deck games, victory goes to the person who throws the most coin at the game.  I'd rather spend my money on a game where all the players playing it have a chance of winning.

It's hard to say anything new or interesting about the game that has changed gaming so fundamentally, in terms of new audiences, mechanics, and business model. M:TG is simply a revolutionary game, a landmark in gaming history that  will affect how we play games for decades to come. I can't think of another game as innovative *and* successful as this one.

RATING: 8
I first played this game almost two decades ago. It was easily the most eye opening gaming experiences in my life. Over time I got involved in competitive play and then eventually stopped playing when I came to realize competitive Magic was about the cards (aka the money) rather than the player (a problem all TGCs will always suffer from to some extent) to an extreme level. It was never designed for tournament level competition. I've played other quality TGC's since then, but eventually they die off. I tried Magic again a little over a year ago and found my enthusiasm for it rekindled. The many years of developing the game for professional level competition has done it a world of good. It's much better balanced for competitive play and yet still retains the "magic" it had as an underground indie card game.

Magic the Gathering is one of my all-time favorite games. I spent years playing, collecting and trading MTG cards, and I loved every minute of it.

RATING: 8
I had a negative review of this game for some time, but I think a more moderate one is more accurate.  The mechanics are not difficult to learn, and the gameplay is generally smooth.  The collectible aspect (and the frequency of new sets) makes serious play pretty restrictive price-wise.

I don't find constructed play terribly fun these days, especially with competitive players who spend a lot more money on the game than I have any inclination to do, but I LOVE drafts.  I think every Magic player (even casual) should give them a try.  A TREMENDOUS amount of fun, and generally not expensive (friends can do it for the cost of a few packs).

Lately, I've discovered Commander.  Let me tell you- that alone is worth playing this game for :)

Played this a lot when I was at school. Well I say played, I mean I had two friends who loved it and they would just sit there going through card combos while I got bored trying to get them to actually play the thing! Great concept but the collectable thing just annoys me.

I have come to the conclusion that is not the collectabilty that annoys (expansions are almost the same) me but more the attitude of some Magic players i.e. Play to win not play to enjoy.

That said I do not like the fact that you do not get a full game when you buy it. Collectable annoying!

I can truly say that that my life wouldn't be as good if this game never existed.  Insane replayability, great memories, lasting friendships.

I never really got into CCGs because of the price barrier. While I never feel strange about paying $50 for a game I know I'm going to play a bunch of times -- or even one I [i]hope[/i] to play a bunch of times -- the constant outlay of money for more cards, and spending even [i]more[/i] if you want to be sure of getting the cards you want, that always kept me away.

Earl brought in some theme decks today and taught me 10th edition. It was fun, even if I got slaughtered three games out of four. I'd be more than willing to play again, but I still don't really want to get into spending money for it.

This is a very clever game. More strategy, and options for different strategies in this game than probably any other game that I can think of. Lot of fun too. The artwork and themes are cool. 

There are enormous cons to this game though. One, it's way too expensive and some cards are just way too good. Basically whomever has the best cards will probably win. Thus I'm not sure how much this game really rewards skill. I probably won't play this game anymore because of these negatives.

Was quite obsessed with the game in my early through mid 20s, spent thousands upon thousands of dollars on collecting the cards. These days, I only have a few starter decks and try not to fall into the old habit, but it is truly a tremendous game...in fact it's the best card game ever, not only for the artwork, concept, influence and collectible elements but also for the supremely intuitive and adaptable gameplay. Haters gonna hate it, or whine because they weren't able to collect it all, and yeah over the years there are some really broken combos (always happens in a game with this durability), but on a design/theme level it is typically flawless.

Booster Boxes: Shadows Over Innistrad x1, Eldritch Moon x1, Kaladesh x1, Aether Revolt x1, Amonkhet x1, Hour of Devastation x1

To those who downrate this game because of the business model: It is easy to buy enough cards on ebay to have a great cardpool and then distribute it to players for deck building (for example as (mock) booster draft, in the Force of will method or otherwise). To jump on the 2 year rotation circus is stupid and no basis to rate the fun of this game.

I used to own my own gaming store, so I have over 100,000 cards and ran several tournaments a week for about 5 years.  I have been playing since I was 11 (4th Edition had just come out in 1995) and still love the game today.

Only major downside is it does require all players involved to have their own collection.  The game is very well balanced as long as both players have cards from similar sets and play within certain formats.  Can be a bit unfair when one player only has cards from most recent set and the other player plays with cards from older sets (thus not playing within one of the regular formats).  One of the best collectible card games out there!

Note: I am looking to trade off or sell most of my collection.  I have from Innistrad and forward up to Khans of Tarkir.  Lots of decent stuff for Modern.  Message me if you are interested.

I don't play this anymore, but I still have the cards and would be willing to play (but I certainly don't BUY any more--the chain is broken!). I think the Rating inevitably gets balanced against the collective nature of the thing, I actually really enjoy the game.

A note to people looking to trade:

I only played the old format fronts (The formatting for the cards changed somewhere around 5th/6th edition). I'm missing more cards as we approach the later part, but towards revised I have every card if not nearly every card (Basically, from The Dark to the Rath Cycle I have several complete sets). I have lots of extras from this time and have zero interest in the newer cards.

Thank you!

Probably my favorite table top game because these were some of my best memories from college.  We didn't have the best cards but I had the most fun making crazy decks built around random (ie. available) cards.  I don't play competitively anymore due to a lack of players but I will leaf through a box or deck and think of something new to tweak.  I'll still buy singles every now and then either for the decks or just for the cool artwork.  Second to chess, this game has the longest shelf-life for me.  Only reason I didn't give this a 10 is because of the CCG aspect, but the game is flexible enough that you don't need the latest/greatest to have fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Despite it's players' reputation of being male huge geeks with absolutely no life and/or social skills (which, sadly, has a basis but I am none of these) the game itself is awesome! As a very flexible game it has several different ways to play called 'formats' and one could play it casually at home very easily. Recommend to everyone who loves fantasy and strategy and the freedom of building your own deck. The downside is that it can get costly, but for a player buying a booster (15 extra cards randomly from the set) it always feels like opening a gift. If it makes you happy, the cost of anything isn't a problem that is what I think.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Brilliant game. The grand daddy of the ccg genre and, in my humble opinion, still the best.

I used to play in tourneys but simply don't have the time anymore - the game has an immense amount of depth for the truly dedicated to explore.

For general gamers looking to get a taste I'd suggest grabbing a few theme (pre-generated boxed) decks for your collection to try it out. You can then expand your collection and options by buying additional cards as and when you can afford/the whim takes you, which opens up whole new strategies and options depending on the cards you purchase.

Excellent value for money - only a money sink if you choose to compete at a high level or wish to have complete collections.

If you see it purely as a fun game to play every now and again then it can be a lot of fun for very little outlay.

A rather addictive Collectible Card Game which I definitely do not recommend due to its compulsive nature. The game itself is fun and definitely deserves a higher rating, but the fact that it is nearly impossible to actually play a satisfying game of M:tG as opposed to just constantly improve your deck ad nauseam without anyone to pit it against makes me wonder if I should rate it even lower. If you are eager to try it out, I suggest buying huge collections of old cards available cheap from eBay, constructing balanced decks, enjoying casual play with those and ignoring the newer editions, otherwise prepare yourself for throwing a LOT of money down the drain.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Ignoring the business-model of MTG, I find it mildly entertaining at best. But unfortunately, that CCG-business-model really turns the game into something different. For one, it dilutes the quality/integrity of the game. But it also turns the game into some lottery where booster packs are tickets for a different type of "currency." And that gambling-aspect is something that really hooks people, especially adolescents who can't participate in a traditional lottery. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very good *game*. Very bad *hobby*. Any CCG is inherently a crock of toss, because it's based on how much money you spend, for random acquisition. In that sense it's not a game, it's a very clever marketing ploy. Rant rant rant. However, once you've got some cards to play with, the game really is quite good.

This is an evergreen game.  You have to really work to make this game get stale; the replayability on the game is the highest I have ever seen, even better than chess. I played way back in 4th edition, then tossed it aside for a while, but have recently invested in a few cards with my brother.  I'm not a collector and never will be, I enjoy the mechanics, but most of all the artwork and flavor of some of the card sets.  The game is great... buy a couple of used theme decks for you and yours to enjoy!

Nagyon rég szemezgettem már ezzel a játékkal, figyelemfelkeltő volt a BGG-listában szereplő kép róla. Csak nemrég tudtam meg, hogy ez a kép egy kártya hátlapja, merthogy ez egy kártyajáték. A játszós barátok óva is intettek: vigyázz, ez gyüjtögetős kártya, el ne kezdd gyűjteni:) Nos nem akarom gyűjteni (állítólag a 17 év alatt 20-30 ezer féle kártya jelent meg:), de egy kipróbálást megért).
60 lapos paklit kell összeállítanunk, tetszésünk, és pénztárcánk szerint, az eddig megjelent sok ezer lapból. A saját paklinkkal bárki ellen leülhetünk, és megmérkőzhetünk az ő 60 lapos paklijával. 5 féle szín van, minden szín más képességekben erős, a paklinkban ezek a színek keveredhetnek. Van lepakolási feltétele (költsége) a lapoknak, van támadó/védőerő...
Egész jó játék, egy bonyolultabb támadásnál elég sok agyalás szükséges, ez már a próbajáték során kiderült.
Összességében tetszett! Játszani szeretnék még vele. 
Több agyon ajnározott játék meg se közelítette ezt élményben (rftg, dominion)... Erről ennyit:)
Nyelvfüggő a játék, de talán még az én angolom is elég hozzá.

Was heavy into this way back.  Bought some cards a few years ago to kind of try to get back into it.  My wife likes to play, although it's getting kind of complicated for her tastes.  The constant expansion cycle gets tiresome, and the constant stream of new rules and mechanics make this frustrating to try and stay current.

The core rules, however, are pretty good and this game can be fun on all levels on down to deck building.

My problems with magic are that I don't care to be "on the treadmill" and am not fond of those who play it to the exclusion of all else.

But it's great (sealed, draft, or something).

I enjoy the gameplay and mechanics of MtG a lot. It's clearly one of the best two player card games ever designed. Too bad that I don't enjoy the deck construction aspect of the game at all. I don't want to be thinking about the composition of my deck when I'm not playing the game. And I don't like the "buy yet another Deck of the Month" aspect of the more competitive side of the game.

It's always fun to play the game for a while with friends until someone (usually me) will start upgrading their deck with more powerful cards and decimating the opposition, and subsequently sucking the fun out of the game. Just give me two equally balanced duel decks and I'll be happy.

RATING: 7
I would like the game a lot more if it wasn't such a money sink.

For little money, you can get a Deck builder's toolkit, a few boosters, and/or a starter deck or two. This will give you a great game on its own, with friends, maybe with a few guys you meet at your college. It'll give you endless fun, and little more in the gaming world beats the thrill of buying a few boosters, ripping them open, and tweaking your decks with your new cards. I have a few hundred cards and I always love a game of MtG with newfound and old friends. For this, I'll give it at least a 7. But...

If you want to play casually with your local MtG community, you're gonna need $30-70 for a single deck to remain competitive. In about 6 months, you're going to need to pay 30-70 more dollars to rebuild your new deck as the new mechanics and power creep will render your old deck noncompetitive. Then you'll probably want another $20 for deck building toolkit (as apposed to your competitive deck) to give you more variety when playing relatively more casual players. For this, I can't give it anything more than a 7.

Note, I'm using the word competitive as in, "it can keep pace with with the other decks played by your local MtG community," not "to be used in competitions, tournaments, etc." Maybe your local MtG will be more casual than mine, but at least where I lived (a very affluent community, admittedly), MtG players would scoff when you say you're not ready to put $50 down on a new deck.

If you want to be more serious, expect to spend *at least* $100 or more ($300 for "competition ready") per deck.

A lifestyle choice.  Much of my enjoyment came from actually building decks though, not from playing.  And building decks required cards that cost money.  Sealed-deck tournaments solved that problem, but still required knowledge of all the cards (new ones all the time) so that you could evaluate the usefulness of any one card.  Overall, took too much time and money but was fun while it lasted.  I am giving M:tG a second look now, with respect to cube drafts.

The grand daddy of my gaming. (away from RPGs). This game  was amazing at first. Innovative. Portable. Collectable. THE dreaded descriptor for all suffering wives and partners. Eventually the collectability tore me away from the game a pauper. Along with the headspinning amount of expansions, rule clarifiactions and dead card stock - what a waste of resources this is to produce and sell. Where's a 'green' designer when you want one?
Still got a soft spot for the old dog though.

The only trading card game I liked when I was younger.  It's quick to pick up, quick to play, and has a good balance of strategy, pre-planning, and luck.  But, those with a lot more time and money are going to build decks that can essentially beat everyone they play; the investment part is why I quit the game.

Magic is the only single thing that has been with me from early high school, to college, to a wife and two children and beyond. While there have been plenty of peaks and valleys in my year-to-year involvement with the game, my overall love and enjoyment of the game has never left me. From every issue of the Duelist to every weekly update of the website, I have followed the evolution of Magic with unfailing appreciation, dedication, and marvel. The game of Magic is indeed excellent, but it is the Metagame by Wizards of the Coast and others that I enjoy more to observe, track, analyze, and yes, even be a part of. Magic is a world unto itself, a creation much larger than either its parts or its creator. This world would not exist were it not for the vast talent, foresight, and thoughtfulness of Richard Garfield and the game's other creators, be they from original days or of current times. The game is an ocean of riches, sometimes undulating slowly and methodically while other times pulling everything and everyone that it touches into a torrential hurricane. But either way, I have for many years been swept into its current and happily enjoying the ride.

Back when I was a sophomore in highschool I played Magic: The Gathering.  I remember enjoying the deck construction process, but the actual gameplay didn't really keep me interested and I abandoned it in favor of the Star Wars CCG. 

I recently played about 2 hours of Magic: The Gathering with several pre-constructed decks.  I felt like I was on auto-pilot most of the time.  Now I can safely say that I have no interest in playing Magic again using pre-constructed decks.  perhaps if I constructed my own decks I would enjoy it a little more.  As for the Star Wars CCG, I haven't played that in years either.

A horrible, clunky game with few redeeming features.  This is another game that has a huge following that simply can't be justified by any rationale.  The rules in the rulebook are overly complicated, and then each card has its own complex and often inscrutable rules, making the whole Magic experience one of chaos and frustration.  In my view the fact that this game has so many devotees should be the subject of a psychology treatise.

One of the best CCGs out there. Excellent organized competitive play, huge amount of strategy and formats, requires lots of skill to play well. Downside is the fantasy theme, which to me gets tiring, as well as the expense and hassle of keeping up with new card sets and strategy.

I have hundreds of rares for trade, starting from Mirrodin Block and ending with Kamigawa Block, including 8th and 9th Edition. Boxes of commons and uncommons too.

RATING: 7
Too commercial but the game IS very very good in standard play with (only) the last two expansions allowed.
Certainly a card wargame. The cards get recycled every two years. So if playing on an "extended basis" (allowing older cards from earlier editions), the game is no longer fun as too powerful combinations ruin the game play. So keep in mind: you are investing an awful lot of money (200 - 500 $) in a card set that's obsolete in 20 months time.
On the other hand, most PC games these days have a life time of 12 months or less.
I downgraded mtg with 1.5 points to a score of 8. The reason is that after coming back to this game after a few years, your old cards are worthless for standard or even extended play.

And if you still want to play with your 3+ year old cards, you fall into an unplayable game where card combos are simply so powerful it isn't even funny anymore. I played 2 games like that with the few cards I still had with magic on line and the only thing I could do is watch after the 3rd turn for ... 5 minutes to see me slaughtered without even having a 4rd turn.

So in this way the game is terrible. It is an unbalanced piece of 13.000 cards monster.

My college buddies got me started playing this game.  Haven't played in a long, long time, but it's an enjoyable enough card game as long as you're not always dropping money on it.  Playing a draft or sealed deck once or twice a year seems to be the way to do it.

I love this game.  I fear this game.

Over ten years ago, I was really into [i]M:tG,[/i] at least by my own standards.  I loved collecting the cards.  I obsessed over tuning my decks.  I never played in tournaments, but I held my own in pick-up games.  I constantly found ways to spend more money.  Collectible Card Games (CCG's) are universally evil in this regard.

Looking past its insidious nature, the game itself is awesome.  The mechanics are clean, the objectives simple.  I love the artwork on the cards, and they have withstood the test of time well.  I am sure that it would be a blast to go back and revisit this game.

Yet I am concerned about sharing it with my two sons.  The last thing I need to do is foster another CCG addiction.  I am already trying to rein in their collecting of [i][thing=2165]Pokémon[/thing][/i] and [i][thing=4154]Yu-Gi-Oh![/thing][/i] cards, when they don't even know how to [i]play[/i] those games.

Ultimately, I will share [i]M:tG[/i] with them, without regard to which cards are currently legal, or how many can be included in a deck, etc.  After kicking the habit once, hopefully I can spike that vein again without succumbing to the temptation of buying more.

If I ever get caught buying another pack someone should beat me with a wrench.

I first played MTG in 1998-ish. I played casually up until the middle of the Kamigawa block. After that it was random draft tournaments every few years. In college we did several. That was more than enough for me.
In the middle of 2016 I tried jumping back in after a move to a city were MTG was the only thing the locals played. Modern, Commander, and Standard were just a bit too much $$ for the enjoyment. Cut my losses and have decided to move on, I'd rather buy a good euro or an expansion or Legendary than more MTG cards.

I played this when it first came out.  Then all the expansions occured.  I got a few of them and then realized I don't want to spend all this money on a game.  So I packed up my cards and there they sit in my closet since 1993.  Maybe in another twenty years the cards may be worth something?

RATING: 7
Used to collect when I was younger and had a big group of friends that would come together in up to 6 player games of MTG with special rules.

Right now it's more nostalgia then anything and if you wanted a great deck  in the current edition you had to pay a great deal of money to get the cards. As things are now magic has a very active second hand market and while old cards might still be expensive to buy seperatly you can easily get lucky at ebay or other trading websites and buy cards in stock at a very low cost. 

Right now I own around 3000 magic cards and 99% from the older series. That's where the fun is for me but since the game is so hugely diverse everyone can find a way to enjoy it with their friends. If you are new a good way to start is by buying inexpensive preconstructed decks.

While some cards go for ridiculous sums of money you can still make great decks with inexpensive and more common ones.

Best played casually with friends

MTG was my gateway drug, if you will, into the wider world of gaming; it was my first taste of collecting something and playing with friends in a truly competitive atmosphere.  Because of those fateful lunch sessions sitting in cafeteria quickly devouring our food to maximize the time we could play a few games before going back to class, MTG will always have a special place in my heart *fights back tears* ;).

What I've come to realize, though, and the reason for my "5" rating is this: I think that good games (card/board/dice/etc) need to have one key component, accessibility, which is severely lacking from MTG.  Whereas in my younger years I thought that the randomization of cards in boosters was novel and exciting and the potential to find a super-awesome card that would be worth tons of money and could give me an edge in game play worth the risk of getting nothing, I now see these two factors as unnecessary hype that's little more than a ploy to make more money.  

I spent so much money on the meager collection that I had amassed (a few thousand cards, mind you), and what did that do for me?  It still left me with holes in my collections because those few cards I really wanted seemed ever elusive and there were always other cards that I had just learned about that "would make my deck so much better."

So ... I think MTG was one of the best games I ever played ... and it pains me a little to give it a low rating ... but because at the end of the day it ends up being a game best suited for the rich or foolish, it no longer does it for me.

RATING: 7.5
I would mostly suggest Pauper, Commander, and Cube Draft. It can be a truly addicting lifestyle game and I am prone to relapsing into it but trying to recover through growing my board game collection (because buying a lot of games will save me money). Try not to slip into paying far too much for decks, but worth picking up some cards for cheap (you can get boxes of commons from card stores for less than most games) and building some casual decks.

RATING: 7.5
I really feel like Magic has grown so large, that it is really a hobby unto itself now. A lifestyle game. If I was actively playing still, the rating would be higher.

Started when Unlimited and Arabian Nights were still for sale. Won AL State Championship and Top 8 at SE Regionals for a trip to Nationals. Stopped buying around 2002 with Judgement. There is not a game that I've played more or that has given me as much joy. Still think fondly of, but do not purchase any longer. One problem was the amount of money it cost to stay competitive as you have to continue to buy the new expansions. Another problem is a new player has very little chance vs. an experienced player. It remains a favorite that I play some casually. I have a few of my tournament decks from 2000 - 2002 ready to play. As fun as it is to play, it may be more fun to create decks prior to playing. I would still be playing in tournaments if not for obligations to wife and daughters.

10/10. Review forthcoming.

NOTE: This review does [u][b]not[/b][/u] take into account the cost of playing the game competitively. If you are heavily interested in Magic -- whether as a collectable, a game, a competitive outlet, or all of the above -- the cost is well within reason (a competitive Modern deck can be had for between $300 and $800, and can subsequently be sold for a good portion of that cost), and of course budget concessions and smart purchasing (making do with substitutes until cards rotate out of Standard or are reprinted, etc.) can offset a lot of the cost.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Magic is like a bad marriage and a crack addiction. You keep pouring more time and money hoping to get that connection or high from some deck you slaved over. Many sleepless nights talking mindless combos with people who can't even buy powdered milk for their children.

I'll play, but refuse to humor the idea of purchasing more cards.

MtG is the absolute no.1 CCG on the market. There is not much doubt about it. Unfortunately it is not as good of a game if you want to be cheap about it. The basic cards and sets are "OK" but its greatness comes with money spent on it. If someone is looking for a game he could dedicate himself to, MtG is great. If you just want to have some fun with friends, try building some decks by your own and not spend tons of cash? Try a different card game. There are a lot of great LCGs out there that will be better for this.

This game was absolutely a 9.5 back in the day.  I think it is a perfect game, but I have aged and interest has shifted, so it falls to a 6.  True, it ruined game conventions in a traditional sense for a few years, and spawned a new genre of games and gamers that are not all together to my liking, but it also potentially saved hobby gaming in general, so there you go.  Some fantastic art, good gameplay, and some absurd card combinations.  Clever, clever, clever.

2017 - (4.0) - Played for a short while with my son some years back, but the "community" again repulsed me.  I still hold on to some decks, but it would take something notable for me to pull this back out.  Maybe grandkids someday...

2005 - (7.5) This game is solely to blame for the tens of thousands of cards from MANY CCGs in my collection.  MTG Online is nearly as bad a money sink as the real cards, but has the advantage of being playable anytime for as long or short as you want.  I don't forsee playing in person anytime soon, but for awhile I was likely to play a game or two online on most any given day.  Haven't played a game in years now, nothing really since Mirrodin...

I played this back in 3rd edition, just before Ice Age came out, and...  just kinda got tired of it.  I found making a flying blue and white deck was just too easy to win.

Flying is normally a weaker-per-manna cost, but white protection spells make them almost invincible.

Which, this was ok and everything, but it seemed like playing with anything else other than a 70% win ratio, once you knew how to get it, was like purposefully handicapping yourself to make the game interesting. At which point, you could make-up a lot of rules to purposefully make things difficult.

Ah, Magic, the legendary CCG that spawned a genre. I'm not actually a fan of MtG, but I play occasionally and have concentrated on white and blue colors and like messing up peoples expectations on how to play:
- Monowhite lifegain deck without any damage to the opponent at all.
- Blue control deck that can be sideboarded into totally changing to Leveler-based quick megamonster bash with tight deck handling.

[b]Luck:[/b] While it is true that the luck factor can easily swing a game of Magic, good deck building, mulliganing and multiple games (best 2 of 3 or 3 of 5) can largely mitigate a lot of this luck. Even so it is still frustrating to loose a game due to being mana short or mana flooded.

[b]Tactics/Strategy:[/b] While the kind of deck you are playing does affect this, Magic is chock full of tactical and strategic decisions, even going as far as the type of deck you play and your choice of sideboard cards.

[b]Weight:[/b] For casual Magic i would put it in the Light/Medium category, but at a professional level this is definitely a Medium/Heavy game.

[b]Fun:[/b] Like a lot of games the fun of Magic depends on the people you are playing against. Tournament caliber decks used against casual players can ruin the fun for everyone.

[b]Conclusion:[/b] Despite it's flaws Magic is a game which has managed to stay fresh and fun for many years and i don't expect this to change anytime soon.

In it's own right a fabulous game. Just the collectible bit kills it. I don't like games where the only thing deciding who wins is who has the most (real life) money.

In the last years I have bought a lot of the preconstructed decks in clearance sales and this has brought a lot of pleasure back into playing Magic. A cheap way to play magic with decent decks.

The most cost effective way to play is to find 7 other friends and do a booster draft.  So far its been great.  Everyone has limited resources (cards) and you do what you can with what you got.

I've played some 2-headed giant, and with the booster draft it makes for some interesting play.

Since its been so long since I played, I had forgotten how powerful certain cards can be.  I'll probably draft differently in the next draft.

I have gone through sporadic levels of interest with this game, which was probably as high as a 10 and as low as a 6 at various points in time.  It is incredibly well designed with cool artwork, cohesive rules that were made more accessible over the years, and constantly changing gameplay.

Of course, the constantly changing gameplay comes from the constantly changing cards, which in CCG terms means a constantly empty pocket.  Every 4 months, Wizard releases a new set, and if you want to play competitively you need to buy buy buy.  Don't listen to anyone who tells you "you only need a starter to play"; if you want to get any sort of real enjoyment out of this game you need to spend money.  The people who invest can field decks that are competitive and fun; the people who can't, well, don't.  An alternative is a booster draft, which means buying three packs ($9-15) for a one-time play.  The advantage is if you have a group who all play magic, you can turn this into a mini-tournament and get enough enjoyment out of it for a few hours to a days worth of play.

I managed to work myself into the top 0.2% of players worldwide online based on my ELO-sytle rating.  The online game is a cash cow but I was at a good enough skill level that I could "go infinite"; that is, my winnings in prizes were of greater value than my losses, so I didn't need to pay anything to play.

However, even thought I was playing for free, I eventually decided to sell all my product and quit.  The game stagnates after awhile, and you just have to stay too in-tuned with the current landscape of cards and metagame.  The whole thing was just way too time consuming for what I was getting out of it.

So, this game was certainly a companion to my gaming for a long time.  While I don't think I would ever suggest a game to anyone (my friends nowadays are not magic fans), I have to admit if a bunch of people asked me to booster draft, or I wandered across a sealed tournament, I would probably jump at the opportunity to join.  MTG is a very fun game; just be prepared to put a lot of time and money into it if you want to reap enjoyment from it.

Will play occasionally if in the right mood.

There are two things that I really dislike about MTG and it is dampening my enthusiasm for the game:

1. Pay to Win. If your opponent has a much better deck than you - then the majority of the time, you are going to lose. No matter what you try to do, you will be obliterated. This can be mitigated by different formats, say by building a balanced cube, and drafting from that.

2. Mana flood/starve. Those totally miserable games when you can't do anything as either you just keep drawing mana or the opposite, where you can't get any.

Due to these balance issues MTG has just become a casual, filler game for me, where I am happy to knock out a couple of games before playing something else.

The best CCG with tons of variety and fun stuff, but since it's a CCG:

1) Very unbalanced since all decks are made before the game.
2) Overpriced.
3) Pay-to-win.
4) Not many choices are made during the game, 
5) The metagame is already somewhat well-known.
6) Building a deck from scratch ("limited" mode) takes forever.

But again, tons of variety and fun stuff, so it's worth dabbling in in one way or another. The players generally agree it has these problems, but it still has so much stuff.

Pretty fun game, but never liked the collectible aspect that much.  Only occasionally play with friends these days, all sealed draft.

UPDATE Aug. 2nd 2011: Started playing Cube Draft slightly more often, and love it as a format! I have built cubes (which is half the fun now) from various complete blocks (Ice Age, Ravnica, Shards of Alara) and lots of my old crap cards. Having a lot of fun experimenting with different card sets and drafting methods.

UPDATE Mar. 6th 2012: Playing more regularly with old friends that are all ex-players. We're playing a variety of formats, from Cube, to sealed, to pre-cons, and both 1 vs. 1 and multi-player. I'd forgotten just how much I liked this game, but eliminating one of the major sore spots for me (collectible format) has brought back the shine.

Originally bought a bunch of this in college as part of a deal to get my friends to buy Jyhad.  Sold off all my magic cards a year later, then bought it again after playing Culdcept on the PS2.  I own less than a thousand cards and haven't felt the need to buy any in over a year, so I at least it didn't become the money hole it could have.

I’m not a big fan of the collectable card games but I have to acknowledge that Magic, as the genre’s progenitor, is way the best and most enjoyable of them all: anyhow I still can’t stand the «collectable» part of it, as it means addiction and a monothematic interest in a single game.

As usual in such games, the most resources (both as time and money) one invests in creating his own deck the better results he’s also likely to get: this is enough though to keep me away from playing it but for the occasional plays with the same friends who just lent me one of their decks to play with them.

As with archery, where you have to bring your own bow and arrows, so too with Magic you must bring your own decks. Book Realm does retail in Magic: the Gathering cards.

That said, Magic players at times try out eachother's decks; and, there is often a deck someone will lend to a new player for the night to try out the game.

RATING: 9
Perhaps the best game system ever invented?

I played this for many years, went to PTQs, Nationals, even a couple Pro-tours.
Mana-screw and trying to keep up with all the sets eventually killed it for me.

I would still probably play this if I could (cheaply) have access to all the cards in the current rotation so I could easily build any deck.  Then again, even the time commitment to keep up with current deck technology is prohibitive.  Its kindof nice learning about totally different games here on the geek rather than trying to keep up with each new deck style.

Limited formats were interesting, however I would get tired of mana-screw.  And yes I did use 17 lands in a 40 card deck, usually with alternate mana-sources as well, and I still would get mana-screwed sometimes.  Quite often (say at least 25% of the time) a match would be decided by who got mana-screwed the least.

Ah well its still a very fun game, sometimes I miss it.

Edit: I started playing again :)

Basic rules are awesome! Other games simulating a duel between magicians can only copy so much of MtG. The only downsides are that expansion rules are sometimes strange and inferior and, well, it is a collectible card game. Here, I do not let the business model reflect on the rules of the game.

As far as the basic rules are concerned, my only complaint is that balancing a complicated deck is a bit too hard, at least for intricate strategies. The reward for brute force/burn decks is slightly too big, but then that is more of an opinion.

The Addiction™ which has robbed me of so much money for the last 19 years. I may stop playing for a few sets but I always seem to come back to this game. It just drips with theme and a lot of the artwork is breathtaking. If you've never tried it, I recommend finding a friend who plays and trying out one of their decks. If they will teach you, even better. Just be aware to be competitive in the Standard format tournaments you will need to invest a couple hundred dollars to either buy cards for a deck OR buy a few of the current Standard sets' booster boxes.

Not a huge fan of CCG's due to the lengthy prep time to just simply build your system.

not to play it again. It's a fun game, but the money

The ultimate card game. I'm not a pro player or anything but I've played for some time. Mostly draft and sealed format. And I must say that this is one of if not the best card game there is. It has it's flaws, and it's not perfect but taking into account all that is around it, the player base the events and so on - there is nothing even close to MTG.

Never got into this, even as a working college student in 1994. Have a friend who was, he bailed and sold off his cards at the right time to make a nice chunk of change, and now only plays with the occasional preconstructed deck. Out of curiosity, I recently bought a core game starter (v7) for cheap and a handful of boosters (v 8-9, time spiral) for husband and I to play with until we get bored. Will only ever play at home. Very portable, all the cards I have and ever want fit in a single small box - there will be no initial "C" in this cCG for us. For <$20 investment, I anticipate getting a few games out of it, not much more.

I somehow (mistakenly, I see) thought the card artwork would be, um... better? More interesting? It's rather lame. Colour me clueless.

Ah magic the money pit.The way around this money grab is to have themed decks supplied by the same person when you play. Also, older cards are less convoluted than newer because hasbro's model is to update often and render older cards useless so you have to buy more. Don't fall into this trap!

A truly fantastic gaming concept.  But after playing it for over fifteen years I'm glad to be pretty much done with it.  I feel that it jumped the shark a few years back.  It also consumed way to much of my time and money relative to the enjoyment that I got out of it.

I've played Magic for over 15 years now, and I doubt that I will ever tire of it.  In fact, I become more involved with it each year.

This is a game with fairly straightforward premise (one can get the gist of the rules by watching a single game) expands so deeply with its rulebreaking nature.  It leads to a near infinite depth of exploration, such that I doubt any other game will match it.

I think Bruno Faidutti said it best, "In Magic, Richard Garfield didn't simply create a game, he created a myriad of possible games for players to explore."

The game itself is amazing. I love the wide variety of decks one can come against, draft & sealed are very engaging, and the art is second-to-none. Honestly, the downsides to this game are simple - cost & community. 

It is *the* premiere CCG and so costs a tonne to get into. Individual slips of cardboard you would like to use are easily sold for ~$60. There are, no kidding, cards that sell for sums in excess $30,000. It is, without doubt, the most expensive game I've ever played.

With the above in mind, the community is *highly* competitive. This may be your thing, but if it isn't - you'll find if hard to locate a group of people who are just casual players. After all, it is hard not to be "serious" about a game that you (over time) spend in thousands of dollars on.

What to say about this game? The "card-board crack" description sounds like a throw away line but there is more truth to it than I like to admit (having heavily succumbed to its lure at one time in my life).

Truth is, it is an amazingly clever game - seemingly simple on the surface and very accessible but with astonishing depth. Deck building is just the beginning. The game is truly innovative and brilliantly conceived.

But, after a period of absolute immersion, I finally had to completely turn my back on the game. As brilliant as it is, in the end it is just a money suck as all CCGs are at heart. M:tG will continue to outlast all the others simply on the strength of the game design itself which is sheer genius. But, as a CCG, it ultimately betrays the people who love it the most. Tragic really...

The game is good - later editions have much cleaner rules, but it's a money pit to compete at a tournament level. Best played casually using a common pool of cards or draft. Prefer playing 1 vs 1 games rather than muliplayer, and draft is the most fun. Play quite a bit with my son using the core set theme decks and the dual decks and my rating has gone up. I like booster draft, but wish you could get this as a non-CCG (just buy a box with all the cards) then it would be a solid 10 ...

My favorite game of all time. I've probably invested too much money into Commander, (I have around 18 decks) but I will always play this over other games when given the opportunity and will always play multiple games if asked. Amazing politics and strategy, even with the randomness of a highlander format. The only game I've played (including other MtG formats) where I feel like everyone can bring their personality to their playstyle and gameplay with their deckbuilds. Commander makes me put MtG at the top of my favorites list, and without it I likely wouldn't play other formats often nor consider it among my favorite games.  This is the game that got me into boardgaming.

This game can be good, but it requires a huge amount of time and money before you really have a good experience.

I played this from the mid 90's through the early 2000's.  The money and time investment of keeping up with competitive constructed killed it for me for about 10 years.

It remains my favorite game of all time.

Yes, to win you must have the cash to buy the cards, but if you just buy the prebuilt decks, and play them as is, it's not a bad game and is then reasonably priced.  To bad it cost so much though.

The original CCG. I only played in Sealed format, which keeps costs down a bit. Still downgraded a point for collectibility, on general principles. They put a lot of research and testing into this one, and it shows. The mana supply system is weak, but I suspect it's in the "ain't broke, don't fix" category. One of the few games where Sealed format is remotely balanced, which is another point in its favor.

Un clásico del que he oído hablar durante la última década, pero no había jugado nunca.

Sin necesidad de explicar nada, ya prácticamente sabía nada. Es un juego de combate con cartas. la gracia está en la construcción del mazo (la construcción se realiza antes de la partida). Hay ya mazos preparados y hay un sinfín de cartas.

La gracia está en el texto de las propias cartas y en los combos que puedes crear con diversas cartas. Está entretenido y es sencillo. No me convence mucho el hecho de que sean cartas coleccionables y que no se acabe la colección nunca.

Magic: The Addiction is an amazing, absorbing, consuming game with the power to take over your life.  It has so many possible combinations, and there is tremendous strategy to both building decks and playing the game.  Downside is the heavy time and financial committment involved in a collectible card game.

I started playing Magic back in December of '93 with the release of the Unlimited edition.  I dropped out of the game shortly after the release of the 6th edition and only got back into playing this summer ('06) during the end of the last set of the Ravnica block, about a month before the release of Coldsnap.

RATING: 3
I've played this on Playstation and it's not bad, but it's just vanilla decks with a little customization. Playing for the first time yesterday with 'real' decks was brutal. We played 6-players Emperor, and the guy who was my 'enemy' drew some elite card that did 6 points of damage and he got it out on the second (maybe 3rd? but I think 2nd) turn of the game. He was then hitting me for 7 points of damage (if you don't know Magic, you start with 20 HP). So, I was dead in I think 5 turns, I did zero damage to him, and there was absolutely nothing I could have done differently. Absolutely not fun and a complete waste of time.

Imagine if in Agricola you could just spend more money to buy some personal booster packs, and one card you could buy is an Occupation card that gives you 5 of every resource and 5 food every round, as soon as you are able to play it. That's what this felt like. Like, why bother playing?

NOT A GAME. Think of your favourite board game. Puerto Rico, Agricola, Pandemic, Space Hulk... do you need to to keep buying extra cards just to keep winning the game? No, didn't think so. It's a brilliant scam, but more fool those who fall for it.

I bought some decks second hand at a charity shop. Played it once. That was quite enough, thank you.

After starting in October of 1993, playing for less than 3 years, I sold my cards & stayed away from the game until I Obtained some free decks at GenCon 2008.  The kids ended up loving the game.  So, we picked up a few theme decks each and are having a ball.

Own all of the theme decks from Ravnica, Planechase & Archenemy blocks, with a few from other sets, as well as some Duel Decks (Phryx/Coal, Lilia/Garuk, Div/Dem).  I really like the Ravnica milieu and Guild specialty rules, its unique.

Magic is fun but it takes a while to learn and can be very un-enjoyable depending on your playgroup.  I absolutely hate playing with extremely aggressive players, and equally dislike playing with people who complain and whine about getting attacked.  I also don't like playing in games of more than 4 people because they drag on forever.  If, however, you don't mind dropping lots of money into a game, and you want a game that has a huge, active community and an infinity of interesting gameplay, Magic is perfect.

RATING: 7
Magic is an interesting game. I can see the appeal for many people, but it's not a game that I see myself buying into.

The generic fantasy theme doesn't appeal to me. I'm also not a fan of the mana system where I can basically lose the game strictly because of the way I shuffled. From what I've read, the strategic play really comes in when you know a lot of the card pool...so as a beginner I don't really feel like I have a lot of control or choice when someone just hands me a deck.

I imagine a lot of the fun and choice is in the deck building...which again is something I don't feel that interested in.

COMMANDER: Commander was more fun because there was a lot of variety in the cards in my deck.

DRAFT: Draft format was a lot of fun and I could see myself doing it again.

On the other hand, the game is actually quite good, so my rating is more generous than perhaps it deserves.

   Longevity.  Magic defines it.  I played dozens of games as a youth, and now have played dozens as a parent.

   The primary lure for me continues to be the artwork.  Few games can hold a light to Magic.  There are just so many beautiful cards...

   Gameplay is often frustratingly mixed though with too much land - or too little, too many cards with high casting cost, or poorly matched decks.  You have to play through those tough draws for memorable matches.

RATING: 10
A guy introduced my friends to Magic at high school and soon we were all addicted. The game was great - many strategies, very portable (we used to play on the beach) and fast. We even played in a few tournaments and each of us won at least one of them. A couple of years later we went to university and neither of us had the time or the money to keep up with the expansions, and so we stopped playing. I am almost sure I will never play it again (I even sold my card collection).

A truly great game, it provided many memories and countless hours of amusement. Thinking of this game makes me feel very nostalgic.

If it was not a money sink, this game would be a 10.
-------------------------------
(June 2017) Played a few games online after almost 20 years and I suddenly remembered why I liked this game so much. True, you can get mana screwed, but the potential for combos and deckbuilding is unparallelled. Many things have changed since I left Magic, but I made myself a powered cube using proxies and hope to play it semi-regularly.

I played this game casual/competitively for about 7 years or so until I got burned out with trying to keep up with it. After getting rid of most of my collection, I have one Modern, one Legacy and handful of Commander decks left. I don't play regularly, but I have stuff available if I ever change my mind. This is a well designed game and tremendously fun and addictive to play, but I've moved on to other things. If and when I play now it's strictly casual.

RATING: 10
Rating for booster draft and Cube draft only.

I never liked constructed play in Magic. I tried to like it, but I hate that pay-to-win aspect of it. Even with the money issue set aside, I find that playing with constructed decks tends to be boring, as you end up playing the same decks over and over again. Unless you happen to have two very balanced decks, one deck will  win consistently, with the exception of bad draws. The deckbuilding can be fun, but you need a huge card pool to build something interesting. And at a competitive level, especially in formats such as Vintage or Legacy, the game can become degenerated (first turn wins) as a result of broken cards and combos.

In contrast to that, Limited play has become my one of my all-time favorite and most played games. In a draft all the good comes together and all the bad is eliminated: Everybody has access to the same limited card pool; deckbuilding in the form of drafting is part of the game which is immense fun on its own; playing relatively weak draft decks is actually more fun than playing optimized constructed decks; you only play the same deck for a few matches; and with the steady release of new blocks, there is always variety in booster drafts; and last but not least it's affordable.

The only thing better than a booster draft is a Cube draft. A Cube is a collection of the best magic cards, usually singleton, rarity doesn't matter, from which you create random "boosters" to do a draft. Incredible powerful cards from all sets, interesting synergies and classic combos all come together, but the decks are still not brokenly good like constructed legacy decks and fun to play. In a singleton format you can even play with the most powerful and broken cards, as any deck will only feature a few of them. 

About the gameplay: the worst part is bad draws, typically in the form of mana screw (not drawing enough lands). This can be reduced by building better decks with a low mana curve and/or enough mana fixers and mana ramp, but it will still happen every so often. The key to have fun despite this is to play quickly, forfeit if necessary, and move on to the next game.

It takes a lot of skill to play well. In our draft mini-tournaments there is one player who consistently wins more than anybody else, first because he often drafts better decks and, more importantly, because he makes less playing mistakes. Knowing the cards, knowing what to play and *when* to play a card makes all the difference.

Besides 1-on-1, there exist also many fun multiplayer variants, like Two-headed Giant. A downside with multiplayer variants is that they usually take much longer and therefore bad draws are more annoying.

I've played Magic on and off a few times and still have a collection of decks and spares. The collectable nature is intensely evil as you will end up spending a fortune to get the best cards.

RATING: 7
Fun game with complicated rules.  The only way to get the rules is online.

Deck building is a meta-game that can be more time consuming than playing the game itself.  You first need to build a deck, and collecting the cards can be expensive.  You can avoid this by buying pre-constructed decks, but the preconstructed decks are usually flawed.  Sometimes people will not want to play with you if you have older cards.

Dueling can be fun.  Multiplayer games do not scale as well and usually end up in drawn out stand offs.

Countless numbers of cards and editions + 5 PC games --- Still waiting for the remake of Shandalar

I rebought the decks from the 4th Edition introductory set.

A timeless classic.
Maybe I will hunt down two original 4th edition preconstructed decks to play with them. That would be awesome.

Update:
After all these years I did it. I bought the original 4th Edition decks that I started with. They are far away from good or competitive...but they are fun. In a nostalgic way.

THE CCG! Forget your pokemon or your Lot5R, this is the original and the best. They didn't call it cardboard crack for nothing. The depth of the game mechanics is awe inspiring and the theme is nicely balanced with playability so that neither overwhelms the other. To keep the whole thing working while regularly expanding, adding and subtracting from the set is a balancing act that boggles the mind. Yes there are too many expansions and the need to keep up is a pain, but that doesn't mean you can't find your level or come and go as you like (and can afford). Don't know if you can call yourself a gamer unless you've "chased the cardboard dragon" for at least one expansion.

Plays: hundreds.   There is a lot of nostalgia wrapped up in this game for me, but very few contests that didn't seem lopsided.

I am not a fan of speed decks or denial decks, which suck the fun out of the room.

Scored higher than I might otherwise for originality.

Used to have a good amount of cards back in the late 90s, but ended up Ebay-ing them all for some cash.  Since then, I've bought some of the retail 'starter kits' for two players, trying to get my wife to try a few games.  Currently I only have around 150 cards and two of those are pre-constructed Duel Decks.  Recently, I've gotten back into it, buying a Deckbuilder's Toolkit and ordering some (1800 cards worth) of the random common lots off of Troll and Toad.  Planning on making a ton of different decks for pick up and play.  I also have some ideas for an interesting variant I hope to test out....

Oh man, was I an addict. Luckily, I got in *very* early, so my early small investment funded the next several years of my gameplay. Eventually, I just burned out on it. Still have all my old cards though. Perhaps the kids will like to toy with them when they get older.

04/23/2009: *Sigh* I guess I'm back into this game now. The "Divine vs. Demonic" Duel Deck was the culprit. Then I picked up 2 Conflux Fat Packs and a Conflux Intro Pack. Bumped rating from 6 to 7.

05/07/2009: Bumped from 7 to 8. Why am I doing this? Damn you, vile addiction! :)

06/18/2009: Picked up an Alara Reborn booster box. I will almost certainly grab a M10 booster box when it comes out next month.

RATING: 5
Sequence: (1) Pre-built decks -- for learning. (2) Winston draft with loose cards. Note: I think the way a Winston draft works is each player ends up with 45 cards from the initial 90-card draw pile; THEN each player constructs a deck of 40-60 cards, using a SUBSET of the 45 cards drawn (so you don't use ALL of them), plus a bunch of land cards -- for 40, it's typically 23 spells 17 lands.

I have played Magic: The Gathering from 1994 to around 2000-2001 (hundreds of games probably). I was mainly playing Type I. My best deck was a "typical for the time" mainly Blue Control Deck. I have done some regional tournaments with it and with some other decks as well.

I stopped because it was swallowing a lot or money and because I lost contact with some of my MtG playing friends. Even though I really liked it at the time, I have no desire to ever play again now.

Causal player from Mirage to Kamigawa (plus a little Lorwyn and Alara).  I regrettably don't play as often as I used to.  As a game designer, I am forever indebted to the thousand lessons MTG has taught me.

The range of strategic options is staggering.  One can lose himself in the galactic scope of things, either trying to take the whole thing in or obsessing over tiny details.  Magic is all that it is because of rigorous playtesting, and it shows.

I'm adding my collection to Colnect so that I can swap individual cards.  You should, too.

Great game, although there are some rather obvious issues with the number of cards available ... I liked playing in the Mirage-Visions-Weatherlight environment, but that&#039;s a bit old now.

Pre Ice-Age is a lousy game, centered around a handful of rediculously powerful cards (original Icy Manipulator, anyone?), an environment that is eminantly avoidable. The more modern sets (starting with Alliances, the first truly great set) are much more balanced and interesting, striking just the right balance between power and balance, with a much wider variety of successful deck archytypes, at least for casual play. However, at the end of the day, this game is really about the deck building. I recently did some pre-constructed deck play, and as good as the deck-building is, the underlying game does not have enough control or tactical depth to be interesting on it&#039;s own.

The main reason I got back into board and card games.  Played competitively for a few years.  Finally got tired of trying to keep up with 3 new expansions every year.  Would not recommend to anyone who does not have a great deal of time and money, as the game can become horribly addictive.  Still, one of the most interesting, surprising and fun games I have played.

The sheer amount of variation, and tight rules keeps this game around and producing new cards and decks after so long. I'm not a great fan of collectible card games at this point, though - it gives the advantage to either the extremely lucky, or extremely rich.

A top notch design that keeps getting better with age. Fantastic ongoing development.

However, the collectibility aspect is a definite turn off. And some of the cheesy art aimed at 13-year old boys can go take a flying leap off a high cliff.

For me, Magic is just way too convoluted to be enjoyable.  I'm sure it might be alright when playing with very basic decks, but once you start adding thousands of different cards to the mix, the game is just a mess of special power on top of special power to me.  I can hardly keep track of what my own cards do, much less those of my opponents.

I realize there are plenty of people that like this sort of thing, but it's not at all for me.

Bought two decks when it first came out. Didn't see what the fuss was about.

Then I watched, incredulous, as people walked into my local game shop and bought entire boxes of decks and boosters. Didn't want any part of it.

I want to give it both a 1 and a 6 to try and give it its due because it's both simultaneously okay and downright awful.

As a game its decent - with workable preconstructed decks it can be okay, although I think deck construction and draw significantly outweighs decision making in importance. Playing a 1993 starter deck was really tedious, but the money sink alternative was even less attractive.

As a meta-game system and economic model, it's a horrendous ever-growing mess.

RATING: 7
Conflicted rating this game.  I enjoy it in a limited way.

Once your deck is created, you follow the direction of the cards.  You make obvious choices, like following a script.

Initially there are more difficult choices, but only if you have land cards--no land cards, no choices.  While in the middle of the game, you played your hand so you draw a card and play a card.  Again it seems like I am merely following a script that I wrote.

Deck building, the "script writing" is marvelous.  You have all this options to create the ultimate combos and test it and play it to fine tune it.  But alas, you need lots of money to have access to lots of cards, to make an interesting deck.

I now understand what Garfield meant, by ."..cards play you."

Not interested enough to spend a small fortune to play.  Playing the MTG Forge AI now and perhaps I will buy a prebuilt deck from someday.

I WAS ASKED THE FOLLOWING:
M:tg isn't for everyone. You give it a 6. Fair enough. What is the highlight of M:tg for you?

MY ANSWER:

No real highlights. I played it and then asked being quite disappointed: "Is that it?!? That's what all the fuss was about...?"

Don't get me wrong. I don't dislike it. It gets a 6. That's above my average, albeit only very slightly. I could have fun with it and enjoy further intricacies unfolding themselves as you get more into it.

But the whole idea of deck construction (El Grande's very limited K&I deck "construction" is probably my limit in that respect!) and the collectible nature of the game, is a major turn-off for me! Collectible means "perpetually deficient" to me. I can't stand that. I want a HOLISTIC gaming experience!

[OLD COMMENT]This is the game all the fuss was made about? The collectible nature certainly is not for me (I want a complete game!), but the game's fun enough nonetheless.

Been playing magic for 2 decades now and the game continues to draw me back. It's inspired countless other card, board and video games. The design is also incredibly flexible to the simple starter editions to 4 player EDH board states that would confuse mathematicians. Endless replay ability, beautiful art, continued impressive design. Costs may be prohibitive for some people especially some of the older formats. I think sealed/draft is one of the best ways to play the game anyways as it keeps players on the same playing field and rewards deck building skills.

Ability to have fun (whether your fun is building cool decks or winning) is proportional to the amount of money you spend. This is why the rating is so low for the game as written.

However, I do own the game as I play Silverblack with my partner from the same pool of cards. This keeps the game affordable (cheaper than an LCG) because Silverblack playsets are subsidised by people chasing rares/mythics and because we can avoid purchasing singles. This way fun can be had and the winner isn't determined by pocket depth.

In the future we intend to try out the coöp enemy-decks as well as the horde variant (which I will print out using artscow or some such, I will certainly not build the decks through the singles market).

My interest in MTG peaked during the Stronghold/Urza cycles, which is when I spent most time and money on deck construction and playing. (My sister and I had an interesting agreement back then: I would give her all the blue cards I got, she would give me all the green cards.) I still have most of my cards and two decks (the better one is a quick, red deck), but I haven't bought any packs for more than a decade, and I'm not planning to, either. What I might do, however, is get a Duel Decks set and try to teach the game to my girlfriend.

The trick to enjoying this game is to not worry about playing competitively and always keeping up with the cards coming out, but instead to play casually with friends and just have a good time.

I never really got into Magic; at my school it was all about Pokemon, so I probably won’t ever play this game again. Nevertheless, it actually does seem like a pretty good game, so I’m not going to rate it a lower grade. If I had actually played it as much as Pokemon as a kid, I would most likely rate it higher as I think the gameplay is actually better than the one of Pokemon.

RATING: 8
The artwork and the,e are both amazing and the gameplay is varied. It is also fun to sit around and read cards and imagine deck builds. 


My criterion for rating games

http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/147053/item/2300390#item2300390


1) Sense of wonder: A large part of the variety and wonder in this game comes from the deck building and metagame analysis. The game outside the game. In the game itself you are biting your nails as you hope you draw the right card. Land, please? Pretty please? NO more lands please? This can be frustrating at times. However, there is also a great number of ways to play magic from Stack to EDH, 2-headed giant, cube drafting, booster drafting, free for all multiplayer, etc. this keeps the game exciting and fun with friends.

2) Meaningful/fun decisions. There are so many ways to go about playing your cards. there are times when you are stuck without decision throughout the game, but for the most part you have to agonize over which cards to play when, which creatures should attack, and which creatures should block.

3) Player interaction:  Lots of interaction through instants, direct damage, monster attacking and blocking, discards, and many other types of cards

4) Game length/complexity: Perfect length game (except multiplayer EDH!) Can play a game very quickly. When using simple prebuilt decks this game is not hard to teach and we can get in 5-10 ga,es in one evening. 

5) Components/artwork  The artwork and theme is fantastic. Cards are great quality

Haven't played in many years, but WotC decided to send out some free "starter" decks to get people interested again.  Well, it was fun to play again for the first time in a long time.

I still think that this particular game was as groundbreaking to games in general, and card games in particular, that Monopoly was 75 years ago.  And it is still an outstanding game to this day.  Despite its age, it still breaks new ground with improved mechanics and ease of play.

It is my understanding that a "Fat Pack" will provide enough cards to allow 2 people to build and play viable decks.  So really, each time a new set hits the market, it's easy to grab some new cards and improve on previously designed decks.  And all for a rather low investment.  It probably won't win you any FNM events to PTQ's, but I imagine it will still be fun.

(thousands of plays)
Although it IS possible to play this game cheaply, it's hard.  The best way to start is to buy a pre-constructed deck for each player. (about $15 where I come from)  Ideally you will have at least one player who knows how to play already, or your FLGS will usually have someone who can teach you.  Once you start playing though, one of two things will probably happen:
1. You'll like the game and you'll want to buy more cards.  It's hard to stop and it can get out of hand.
2. You'll dislike the game and won't play it again.

A clarification of why this is a 5.  I originally played Magic: The Gathering before they banned certain cards, like the Black Lotus and the Mox gems, but after these cards were not available unless you were willing to pay a ton of money for.  The game just was not all that fun when your opponent could whip out that much power that fast.

Since those days I know they have worked to stop this from happening.  Still, I don't really see the need to dump in huge amounts of money to get what is probably a mediocre deck at best.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First played this in 1994 and 95 back in college. Then totally rediscovered this recently. It can be an absolute money pit, and it doesn't help that they market it directly toward your wallet. However, the incredible diversity of ways to invent your personal style is totally admirable. 

They've done a lot to standardize the rules since 1995! However, playing this game demands a willingness to continue to learn the evolving ruleset, and that's not for everyone. Plus, some people take it too seriously.

I'd like to try this again, with a limited card set and the right people. You know, the people that wouldn't treat it like a way of life.

Update: played 5+ games with a good friend using our various decks from different series. This is really a wonderful game... the only problem is the disparity in deck building. It's just not fun if someone is forced to work from a shallow pool of cards and then pit themselves against a deck that's a highly tuned, efficient, maximized-player-killing-machine. Balance is the key... similar card pool, similar interest level, similar budget. 

I am, however, very proud of my zombie deck. :)

Update: Oh, who am I kidding? I updated this to a "7." I could easily get talked into a booster draft. I don't ever see myself spending the same amount of money that I did in my "early exhuberance," but I'm still willing to play this compelling game.

You pay a lot in terms of game balance and actual money in order to have a highly customizable and vast card pool.

When the game is at its best, it's one of the most interactive and engaging games out there. When it is at its worst, it's a dull chore to finish a game. But I can't deny I've spent a lot of time playing it, and the moments when it is off are worth the times when it is on.

Picked up a starter set to give the game another go, after 15 years (like the Pokemon TCG), and... in all honesty, feels exactly the same as it did back then. Can't say the overarching story is very interesting, but some of the new land-based mechanics are neat. On the whole, though, I think I shall stick with collecting its counterpart going forward. Was nice to try it again, but with the overall price of keeping up to date... that's the killer.

ADDENDUM: Picked up a second Duel Deck (Blessed vs. Cursed), and what a difference the overarching theme/story makes in personal enjoyment. The gothic horror premise of the Shadows Over Innistrad  setting really does make the most recent set stand out.

The artwork is stunning, and while resource generation can be an issue and combat is simplistic, the joy of Magic remains undiminished after more than two decades.

Unfortunately, this is a collectible card game, which means some of the nicer cards, combinations and/or strategies cost way too much money. To me (a starving college student at the time I actively played this game), many of the prices seemed ridiculous for mere cardboard and ink. I was also unhappy with the idea of banned cards - WotC should have playtested and balanced the cards BEFORE releasing them, instead of banning them from tournament play after players had already paid ridiculous prices for them. By the time I left this game behind, the rules and card abilities were becoming more convoluted and conflict-ridden. However, once you get past the price and the collectible aspects of this game, the original rules and 'classic' decks are not bad.

My 11-year old nephew-in-law asked for the 2011 core sets for X-mas. I got a few myself so that I can play against him. I will never turn down a game of Magic if asked to play and I always have a lot of fun, but it's not really one that I try to convince other people to play. Instead I'm always trying to get them to help me play new games that I just bought.

I strongly dislike collectible games with rarity elements. Furthermore, MtG is a dull math game with a pasted on theme that I would probably give only a 4 or 5 if it were not collectible.  I'm not sure why people are still playing this when Garfield's Android: Netrunner is a much better game and does not have the card rarity issue.

What an odd game.  There's an odd sort of thing about this game that's both endearing and awful.  You can play it with nothing but a couple of pre-made decks, which is fine, but you miss out on the fascination of creation, which is really cool.

As long as you don't mind A: Spending the money, or b: making up a few proxies for cards you like.  Because frankly, to play it well against other people who do either of these things, you HAVE to do one of those things.

But honestly, I'm not sure how much more can be said about the game and meta-game here - It's fun in the right doses to me, even though it's clear that cards are more ridiculously powerful than ever.  So I'll probably keep playing, and even maybe buy some more.  Because it's there.

The grandfather of all CCG's. Magic was once the best CCG game out there but is no so long in the tooth that it has become boring.

The game is easy to deckbuild and even easier to play. It's failings come about because it is designed almost exclusively for powergamers and not casual players. WotC need to go back to the first decade of the game and see what made it so good then and bring that back.

The collectible aspect of my-set-of-cards-I-spent-$X-on-vs-your-set-of-cards-you-spent-less-than-$X-on isn't appealing to me. 

I thought that, if one plays within the confines of a finite, previously established collection of cards from which all players may build their decks, then the game play could be very thematic and the mechanics could be quite fun. 

However, I now judge a CCG based on whether it's fun or not even if you didn't build the deck at all. In other words, if you were just handed a deck to use, would you still have interesting choices within a game or would there not really be any significant decisions? Magic, unfortunately, doesn't offer that (at least not enough for me).

I started collecting in 2003 for about four months.  I had fun and I love the art.  It almost sucked me in.  Premade decks made it easy to get into the game.  I made a fast, simple red/white deck but other than that I didn't get addicted.  I guess that's a good thing.

Update: 8/2009 - Got back into Magic.  Divine vs Demonic duel deck, and a bunch of boosters.  Participated in my first draft, so much damn fun.  I'm planning on making a cube to keep spending down.  Going to approach it casually.  Drafts from my pool, maybe add a booster now and then.

Yeah, right dude.

Oh, Magic. This took my elementary and middle school by storm. I never actually played many games of this - I just liked admiring the cards.

I have a very cyclical relationship with this game. I know it's importance not just historically but financially as all game stores I know make the majority of their money from Magic tournaments and players buying cards. However every time I get back into this game the players get more and more toxic and far more sleazy. I remember a guy in college who ran a Magic racket with the new expansion. It was kinda sickening. Also like the Simpsons, it's a shell of its former self.

Building decks is fine, but if you remove that the gameplay is a complete slog. Once the deck is built you mostly don't need to be there. I'm also not a fan of a game that you can do better at simply by spending more money. That being said, I'm glad this game exists for the effects it's had on games made in it's wake.

I have a good collection of cards from Ice Age through the tempest block.  Stopped collecting around Urza's Saga, but have since gotten back in since Kamigawa block - I'm a sucker for gaming with Samurai.  The following sets have only gotten better, though I think Ravnica may have been the peak, and I've played in constructed tournaments a bit.  Magic is one of the best CCGs out there, and has a very good design team working on new sets these days.  I have dropped out of Magic since Ravnica rotated out though, and I am now playing Legend of the Five Rings (the environment of which is superb since the release of Samurai Edition).

I love Magic. I've played it on and off (mostly on) since I first played it in 1995. I started the game playing casually 1 vs. 1 with my Mom, went on to multi-player at our local store, to competitive local tournaments in Extended and Type II (now Standard), then back to casual cubing with a friend, on to EDH (now Commander) and now multi-player of all-sorts with a mixed group that includes many players I've played with for years and my girlfriend who is new to the game. I play paper and some online, though online is mostly Pauper and Cube when it is offered as I have no interest in breaking the bank for virtual cards.

I hate the economic model of Magic, it is easily the most expensive game in the world to play if you truly love it and want to have the ability to play what you want, or even the format you want (as sealed / draft is my favourite, but cubing isn't quite the same and new product is expensive as heck, doubly so if you do it online). That said, it is also one of the most varied and richly rewarding games ever made. No other game has sustained itself for such prolonged periods of play for me, or has weathered as many storms. Yes, I know the pure abstracts have gone on for millennia and likely will continue as such, but those are always the same game from outing to outing. The beauty of Magic and its unending releases is that as things rotate into and out of the game the strategies can evolve and change. The game today is not the same as the game with a different pool of cards 2 years from now.

Strip away all of the annoyances with the economic model and what remains is one of the most deliciously subtle and varied games ever made. The game is both strategic and tactical and is full of subtle timing nuances and tricky decision trees. That all goes double when you play Limited (sealed formats) as you have to effectively build your deck on the fly and also pilot it effectively. My rating probably shifts a bit based on what version of Magic we're talking about, as Limited (of any sort) is probably an easy 10 whereas Commander with 4+ players, my least favourite format, is more like a 6. That said, on an overall scale, it's hard to give this anything less than a 10 as it is one of my all-time favourite games and I am always interested in playing several different versions of it.

I will simply close by saying that after 20 years+ of playing Magic I still find it fascinating and still enjoy shuffling up a new deck. I expect I will still enjoy this another 20 years from now. Fantastic design.

RATING: 3.5
In retrospect the money I spent on this CCG would have been better spent just about any where else.

The CCG model can be seen as exploitative (board game crack for the gaming addict - that definitely incudes me) and can lead to pay to win mentality.  Its wasteful (boxes of unwanted cards) and after a while insulting (anyone up for a puse deck to go with the red, white, black, green and blue decks also what cards for a ninja snail deck to go with your robot dwarf deck) just so they can carry on taking your money. 

CCG and other collectible systems tarnish a company's long term reputation (I think less of them) and as a business model does not encourage a company to be lean, efficient or inovative (why cut overheads and offer value if the suckers keep spending their money on the same old product).  A company can end up fixated on exploiting an ever diminishing core clientele and can use up all the customer good will which most hobby companys accumulate effortlessly.

The DNA of this model can be seen in minature games that keep changing the rules, army sizes etc in hope that they can essentially keep selling you the same product over and over again.  This often means that older players become disenfranchised (due to the incompatibility of their existing investment in the game) and they depend on fresh batches of youngsters to exploit.  I would also argue that role playing games on the 3, 4 and 5th editions are probably exploiting their customers (depending on how compatible older adventures are).

The DNA is just below the surface of LCG games and cynical core set games with limited content hoping to sell you more product later.  I would, however, argue that they are usually a lot less wasteful and you can often work out how much money they will cost you by looking at the release schedule.  

It could also be argued that wargame companys release many products that have barely been played tested to an aging audience that can no longer find the time to play them. There is a trend towards quicker and simpler games that I think needs to be focused on if wargamers and the companys that service them have a future. This hobby has never been mass participation in the UK and never will be if they keep selling product that realistically will remain unplayed.

Exploitation of customers can ultimately be self distructive.  I have failed to buy some FFG products since I fully expect that after buying the initial game along will come additional content, additional minitures etc and finally an incompatible second edition (although they do often produce a conversion kit).  I know I will often complete a set of games in a compulsive manner, this piece of self knowledge has made me stay clear of FFG products that I am not sure I would like Runebound.

I am a fully paid up member of the adult world and can usually make good decisions about spending my money etc and I would say most gamers are the same.  At the same time they know what they are doing by engaging our collectors compulsion. Exploitation diminishes everyone involved. What appears initially to be a perfect business model can cause a customer to fully disengage from a product line, a company or the whole hobby.  

I would ask a company when they are releasing yet more content to sure that it represents value for money, offers something genuinely new and above all will not make the customer feel foolish for spend their time or money on your product.

What can I say. A magic charme.
It saved the all field of boardgames. And pushed new life in our dying breed. I played it for 5 years then stopped, it was getting a job. But I play from time to time with constructed decks, and it's always a blast. Now I'm playing less and less perhaps I'm getting bored by the fact that this game hasn't found a "classic" format which is stable over time. The fact that the environment is always changing is a plus for a regular player is getting a major annojance for the casual gamer I'm now.

It always amazes me that this continues to be as popular as it is... I guess it's the perfect example of genre momentum.  Because there are dozens of CCGs that are way better than this game; they lie strewn in the discontinued and discount bins of game stores around the country.  The game is heavily dominated by luck.  Land is not a design advantage, it is an obviously crippling flaw.  I'll only play this now to satisfy my long time friends who haven't come around to the right thinking yet...

I no longer play the game, but I think it's impossible (even irresponsible)as a gamer to neglect, deny, or downplay the significance that this game represents- for better or worse- in regards to our hobby.  When it was released, it was absolutely revolutionary for its time and nothing will ever come close to beating that sense of exploration and discovery in opening the first packs of alpha, beta or unlimited and playing with those early, clumsy decks that relied on Giant Growths or Howls from Beyond.  However, I do think the collectible racket turned out to be quite harmful to gaming in general and I think it's a shame that what is really a clever game system had to be saddled with such a horrifying (yet absolutely brilliant) marketing scheme.  The game is marketed directly at human greed and lust for power over their peers.  I'll likely never pick the game up again, but I respect its importance and I'll always have fond memories of playing 1993-1998.

The sheer number of cards and different ways to combine them give this game near unlimited replay value. But the bad thing about having so many cards is they are always adding new abilities and it costs money to keep up.

It reshaped the gaming world and defined a new category of games. The game play is always interesting and has a strong meta-game aspect. The variety is at this stage effectively endless.

I rate it a 4 because even with premade decks, it gets old fast, and then you need to pay more to spice it up, and from that point forward, it's all down hill.

And for the people that say you don't have to spend a lot to be competitive, get with it. Money spent directly increases chance for success. Magic: The Gathering does not exist in a vacuum.

It's a money sink, I know. But somehow I was talked into attending a limited booster draft. I'll read through the rules and see how it goes.

UPDATE: Finally, I got around to it. Thankfully, it was 2HG and I had someone along to help. It was most definitely fun, but I'm not seeing myself becoming anything else than a casual player. Maybe some drafts once in a while, because I like deckbuilding.

You know what? I've changed my mind. This game has a very, very steep learning curve which requires time and devotion to an extent I do not possess to climb. Plus, I don't like how you get to start with a deck and you never get to shuffle it so that you run through it again. That's right, that's what too much Dominion does to you. You start to ENJOY shuffling.

I have about 80 cards now. I'll probably give them away or something.

From my limited experience of playing the game, I say it's probably by far the best of its kind. However, for people with limited money it is hard to get the right cards. 
In my opinion there is no such thing as a good card; any card is good if you know how to use it. Which brings me to my final point; beginners probably won't know what cards work well together unless they have had a reasonable amount of experience.

Played MTG on and off since limited edition and Arabian Nights - pride of my collections is a complete set of Legends. As a game very good - but can be very expensive, the rules are increasingly a problem, especially with all the new mechanics. I will certainly play again - not sure that I would want to buy any more cards (unless they re-issued the Moxes/P9 at a reasonable price!).

MTG is one of my preferred cardgames because it has a very high [u]interaction[/u] between players and has a huge variety. The "drawing issue" can be frustrating (being mana short or drawing just land and having no cards to play). The deck-building part before the confrontation is very interesting.
I own the [i]MTG: Deck Builders 2013 Toolkit[/i], all the five different [i]Rise of the Eldrazi Intro Packs[/i] and most of M13 free half-decks (around 700 cards).

I played too much of this game in the ninetees. But with it's 15.000 cards the strategic depth of Magic is still unsurpassed. Probably the biggest breakthrough in gaming after RPGs.

Played a game with my sister, not knowing much about it. Left me feeling lukewarm and don't have the desire to play again. 

I now understand that much of this game is the deck creating/building. Much of the appeal seems to be trying to create the most powerful and efficient deck, rather than the actual playing of the game itself. Not a game for me as the time investment would be too great.

I'm sorry to say I find Magic to be unnecessarily convoluted, overly fiddly, exception-riddled and inelegant.  Perhaps if I was into the MtG Lifestyle I would see the depth past these flaws but as someone who would only play occasionally (and with someone else's deck) it ruins the fun.

I think this is the best two player game. 

People have said that Magic is a contest about who can spend the most money. That's a little like saying baseball is a contest about who can spend the most money. Yes, your rec league team is going to lose to George Steinbrenner's team -- but that doesn't mean that baseball is bad. It just means that you can't play against the Yankees.

You can't play Magic at tournaments without spending a large amount of money, but that doesn't mean you can't play Magic without spending a large amount of money. Spending $40 on 12 packs -- perhaps from 3 different sets -- plus another $10 on basic lands, gives you a collection that's large enough to play a variety of formats with 4. 

Spend another $12 every 4 months -- that's no worse than Dominion -- to add more variety.

What a great game. I don't know that I have found a game that has made me think up strategies as much as this game has. It does rely somewhat on the cards that are available to you, but this doesn't weigh against it much. I have played games that have lasted any where from 10 minutes to 3 hours. Works great one on one, and great with as many as 6-8 people. Just an awesome collectable game.

Own a few thousand cards.  This may be the game I've played the most.  I've mostly played draft or commander.  I prefer the latter format to the usual 60 card decks, primarily because it evens the playing field (although you'll still needs some good cards!), and because the variety of play is much greater.  Your deck is no longer just a one-trick pony.  Once you've built up a solid collection you can just pick up the odd card for deck-building, and with highlander you only need one of each, so that's easy.  The artwork can be a bit grotesque (the black cards), and the magic universe has some strange elements to it, but in terms of gameplay this is one of the deepest games I've played.

I played this again recently after having largely ignored it for several years.

The CCG aspect of it is out of control and has been for years.  But it is a great game.  There is so much variability in formats and the experience you can have with it.  It is very easily playable without the major investment.

RATING: 2
There was a time when I was sensitive to the lure of Magic, but the lack of people to play against soon led to a faded interest. Many years later, I took an opportunity at a fair to play with a specially designed starter kit, and liked the simple mechanics. However, upon arriving home and opening up the pack of 60 or so cards, I got extremely frustrated about the lack of clear summarised rules, and the finickiness of the complete ones. I threw away the sets (to the chagrin of my girlfriend, she liked the artwork) and focused on other things. A game which doesn't come with good, clear rules, and requires a number of expansion kits for things to become interesting is broken by definition.

Yes, I know that nowadays you can get cheap decks which are not current anymore. Yes, I know it is your choice to allow yourself to become trapped in the money pit. Yes, I know you can agree with others to only play with a particular set, so the emphasis shifts from Ccg to cCG. Yes, I know the sight of countless slender adolescent boys with the occasional tomboy girl (model 'Homo sapiens geekis') thumbing through the dime-a-dozen binders hunting for a misplaced rare one, are not representative of the actual game. But since I don't know the 'actual' game as there are no clear rules provided with a deck, the game remains put at a rating of 2.

[b]Update[/b]   The above all said, even if I was able to shell out some cash to purchase a complete set of cards of older editions so I could experience the activity of deck building, I highly doubt I would find Magic an appealing game. Recently I have played a number of Magic-equivalents: games where am I asked to create combos from a few to many separate cards drawn from either common or personal decks or anything in between. I've come to dislike such designs with passion as they violate a gaming principle I hold dear: that richness in gameplay should arise from simple rules. Magic breaks that principle with flair by allowing the cards to be played to more or less be rules in themselves. In a way you could say that I would probably find Magic too complex for the resulting game patterns which arise from such a design, and thus I still feel comfortable with the ranking I gave.

I used to realy love this game!

I don't play it anymore ... Somehow the über-ambitious people destroyed the game for me. But still: I consider M:TG as the most genius game invention, I know of! (therefor I will still vote 10) In the beginning, the tournaments really had the athmosphere of all this different wizzards gathering together - each one with some special mixes and combos in their spellbooks - and they played against each other to find out, which ideas and combos worked best.

Until the über-ambitious players destroyed it by simply copying succesful decks they read about in the internet ... and then suddenly you went to a tournament to play several times against the same deck of cards ...

IMPORTANT NOTE:  
Whomever says that the only way to play or be good at this game is to spend a ton of money is truly mislead.  There are a ton of ways to play Magic very cheaply.  Cube, repack, and individual card drafting to name a few.  Only the obsessed play this game in tournaments and/or constantly purchase the newest cards.  You don't have to do that, to enjoy this game.  Simply pool your cards together with your friends and let the drafting begin.

MY RATING:
For all the love I've given and received from this game, it will probably be my only 10, ever.  The endless combinations and mechanics possible in this game make it a true winner that I will never tire of.

I've played many of the "stand alone" two player card games here on the Geek, but none of them can compare to the depth and variety that this game has.

True, the game can be expensive to collect if COLLECTING is your goal.  But, if PLAYING the game is your motivation, then you can easily build up your collection slowly for very reasonable costs while getting hours of fun/play out of them.

My collection is now close to 30,000 cards that I have built up since 1995.  I'm an addict who knows it and loves it.  However, I don't feel one bit scammed by the manufacturer nor do I feel any resentment/remorse for purchasing my cards.  In fact, the great part of Magic is that it continues to expand and improve.  This seemingly never-ending growth will ensure that I never get board of it.  You just have to go into MTG thinking you don't have to have every card nor the most powerful ones unless you wish to compete in tournaments.

[COLOR=#990000]**[Español** ¿Para qué negarlo? cuando uno se pone a diseñar un juego siempre está pensado en este juego.

La mayoría de los CCG se resumen en robar, descartar y comprar; lo bueno del Magic es que fue el primero.

Ya no lo juego así que actualmente no lo recomiendo jugar ni comprar. Se está quedando anticuado, debido a los siempre problemas de mana, precios de las cartas, expansiones infinitas y que los colores cada día se parecen más los unos a los otros.

Cualquier nota dada a este juego es válida, yo tal vez le deje un 10 por motivos nostálgicos y otros que no vienen al caso.[/COLOR]

I have a secret that has to come out. When MTG was released I thought the art looked crappy and bought 
Spellfire cards instead. Big mistake. After the art 
started to get better and now is state of the art I
can agree that MTG is the king of CCG`s. I`ve even been
an organizer for a few years until WOTC made a stupid mistake of requiring organizers to have at least 30 new 
players introduced each year. In and around the city I live you would be hard pressed to find that many players.
Oh well love the game and have a crap load of cards and

This is my favorite game ever. I have played it since 1997 and it was my only non-PC game I had played for a long time.
It feels more like a life style than just a game. It has so many layers and options that you can enjoy it from many possible angles - being competitive player, casual one with the regular group, collector, buyer/seller, or anything between.
My MtG game life was developing from time to time but now I play almost solely EDH (Commander). And from time to time I spice it with some limited event (Draft with friends or prerelease sealed).
I have 14 EDH decks (almost fully foiled-altered) and I would say quite huge collection of other cards as I don't enjoy trading (or selling) much.

What I like:
- number of cards due to the age of the game (endless opportunities for building decks)
- variable formats where everybody can find what he likes
- EDH (commander) is the best gaming experience for me, I spent hundreds of hours playing it. And tens of hours building my decks, which is maybe even more funny
- I like the collection aspect of the game (introducing foil cards is a great move)

What I dislike:
- the price of the cards is very high in general, it is very expensive hobby to play MtG on some level. (although especially foil cards hold their value and maybe even grow in it in time so it can be seen as investment)
- I don't enjoy much the competitive environment - the guys who takes it too much seriously. There is too much competition among them and unhealthy atmosphere. I prefer local gatherings with group of friends and semi-casual games.

Quite enjoyable and easy to play. Strategy mostly comes from deck building. But still lots of in-game strategy about guessing opponent strategy and if cards are complicated. Pros of CCG over the LCG model: 1) excitement of opening boosters, 2) adjust deck based on what you actually own, 3) unlimited cards and deck ideas, 4) build casual decks is less expensive than LCG. Pros of the game: 1) level of complexity is adjustable for new players, 2) epic battle and strategy depth is possible with more complicated cards, 3) crazy combos, 4) many ways to play for multiplayer too.

The principle "whoever spends the most real money wins" is pretty much the very definition of something which "defies description of a game" and is "clearly broken" to me. Too bad that many gamers still fall for this kind of scam! Probably because if it weren't a contemptible CCG, the Magic card game would actually be a good game.
Playing "limited" formats (Booster Draft or Sealed Deck), which some people have brought up in response to this criticism, isn't a suitable solution for me as I definitely don't want to buy new boosters for each time I play.

However, I find it really fascinating how Magic manages to offer widespread tournaments with attractive prizes. I just wish other popular games would learn a lesson from this and offer (more) organized tournaments. I realize they can't offer prizes as large because they don't scam so many gamers to finance that, but they could still implement a more organized tournament scene. Some promo items as prizes don't cost much but can still be a sizeable incentive to compete for. I think FFG Organized Play is a promising development in this area.

Played a lot back in the day, but haven't touched it in over a decade. Deckbuilding was always more than half the fun for me. Great rulebending game, though a victim of its own pioneering (absurdly complicated rulings required). The dynamic of having lands as a mana source is kind of sub-optimal, but baked into the design.

2011: I've started playing occasional EDH. Fun! And nostalgic.

2013: Nope, not anymore. I might like it with a more casual crowd, but the group I played with used decks high-powered enough that I had to spend too much time on deck building/tuning in order to be remotely competitive.

RATING: 8.5
 The Lego of gaming.  Tons of crazy situations, adaptation, player interaction, and creative thinking.

Unfortunately, there is the mana screw: a random occurrence that you don't draw your resources so you effectively can't play the game and you choke no matter how skilled you are. Mulligans and good land ratios reduce the chance of this happening, but don't eliminate it.  

I also strongly dislike the collectible nature of the game, where you don't know if what you are buying is what you want, and better collections make stronger decks.

Even with these flaws, Magic has some serious strengths, and I spend more time on it than any other game that I own.  If Richard Garfield made a non-collectible version of Magic that solves the mana screw and other random annoyances, I would probably finally have a game I would rate a 10. (Here's hoping that Netrunner lives up to the hype.  Fantasy Flight did a good job on the Lord of the Rings LCG, but with all its coolness, its mission based structure reduces the replay value.)

That's a really deep and interesting deck-building CCG with endless numbers of combinations and decks, but it's a real money-sucker at the same time. No... It's a big black hole to spend your money and time in.

Production: Nice graphics, and nice layout, though the essential information on each card (cost, strength, etc.) is difficult to read from across a table.  Play: Some interesting decisions, but basically if I had a land I played it, if I could afford to summon a creature I did, and if I could do some damage I did that too.  At any point, given the powers available, the game could have swung drastically either way; I think it becomes satisfying only when players each have deep familiarity with each deck in play.  (2+1+2) (2 plays)

Just being the original CCG game gives this game huge bonus points. Everyone else who came after could work off the basics of this game, but for the first go round at this sort of thing, they did a fantastic job. The only downside of the game is the cost involved and the rules can get tricky with some cards causing problems with others.  If you just booster draft now and then, its still pretty fun and cheap. Cool artwork, revolutionzed gaming ( D&D in 30 minute game? no Dungeon master needed? too cool!) Im sorry, you cannot have played this game and give it a rating of 3 or less. The people here who did so, obviously had some sort of traumatic events happen to them at a tournament or something.

Magic isn't just an addiction, it's a disease, like malaria or Ross River fever: once it's in your system, you'll never be free of it. Sure, you'll have times when you say you can't afford the time or the money, so you put it away, maybe sell your cards. But you'll be back, cursing yourself for dumping all those great rares at knock-down prices.

Of course, as well as being an addictive (and possibly psychoactive) drug, Magic is hugely successful. It is probably only rivalled among gamers' games by Settlers of Catan in terms of reach: Settlers has sold approximately 10 million copies, Magic has had a similar estimated number of players. I suspect that Wizards of the Coast has made the greater amount of money out of Magic, though.
It is as collectible as you want it to be, as demanding of your time as you allow it to be and, thanks to the expansion release schedule, constantly refreshing in its challenges.
That said, once you know the basics, you can pick up and play (or draft) just about any set.

I purchased an Instant Collection from CoolStuffInc, which came with enough cards to build plenty of deck options.  Played casually with others who've done the same, this is a nice, light game with plenty of options to keep it feeling fresh, and for a pretty small price.  As long as other players are buffing out their decks by spending lots of money, this is a great value for a solid game.

I bought a ton of these cards when they first came out, but never played much.  After recently playing Magic on Xbox, I've become interested again.  I think I'll keep these cards around longer than I originally intended.

Yeah - fun.  Didn't make me want to remortgage my home for booster packs - I bought a deck builder kit and stuck with that.  It had something a bit rare in it which I have no idea how to play so I leave it out of my ridiculous - but oddly effective - green and blue deck, but I show it to people that go "ooooh - you got (that)" and for a brief moment I feel better about myself, like I've achieved something in this random purchase - but actually I haven't.  Regardless - fun little game.

Seminal. Tremendous replayability. One of the great games of this era, even if it isn't the deepest or most strategic game, and even if expensive powerdecks may dominate tournaments. The game design was brilliant back in 1993, and I still will pick up and play anytime, 14 years later. I also really enjoy Magic Online on the Internet.

[Updated 3/9/09]: I moved Magic to a 10, following two glorious weeks of playing with my children via Winston Drafting thanks to this exceptional posting by Ender Wiggins, whose practices I have essentially duplicated -- just a great example once again of how the Internet connects you with people who lead you toward a better experience or destiny than you would have found on your own -- if you have any interest at all in Magic, read Ender's posting:

I think the game is brilliant, but having played it religiously as a kid, I don't feel the need to ever really play it in real life. (I do occasionally play computer implementations of it.)  

This reflects my ambivalence about the game. It's immersive, customizable, and fun, but it's also a greedy marketing strategy.  

In my view, the best way to enjoy MTG is to play it on your computer or your Xbox.  Or, if you have friends around who'd agree, play a style that limits what cards can be used so there's no arms race to spend the most money.

The rating for this is at odds for several reasons, and I'm not tracking plays for MTG as I've played this far more than anything else. I returned to tabletop gaming in general thanks to my former housemate who introduced it to me before I moved in with him, so if it wasn't for him and the friends I have met through him I most likely wouldn't have been lead to redeveloping my board game hobby. I have met a lot of other friends and people whose company I enjoy because of playing MTG competitively. I bypassed Standard and went straight into Modern, followed by Legacy. I enjoy Commander and still keep quite a fair number of casual decks. I have spent somewhere within the vicinity of $15,000 to $20,000 on MTG and I regret very little of that.

The almost absolute freeform creativity in building decks is still unmatched by anything. The plays can be potentially massive and can fall apart to a single response. The widely immense variety of game strategies thanks to a card pool spanning decades allows for highly amusing games. Two of my favourite casual decks that I own are a mono-blue suicide aggro deck and a mono-green control deck, both of those revolving heavily around cards that have not been seen in Standard for a decade or longer and are way out of touch for what the MTG colour pie represents now. The game at its core is simply amazing, even with the massive design mistake of having mana in the same deck as your main cards. Force of Will fixes this crucial flaw, at the expense of not being able to do ridiculous mana ramping.

However, I cannot give MTG a 10, ever. Why? You'd think the fact that cards are officially distributed in booster packs would reduce my rating, but that doesn't affect me. Apart from drafting and having excess store credit, I have not bought a booster pack in two years. Even when I was, I would only buy a fat pack of each set and nothing more. Cracking boosters isn't addictive to me. What really bothers me is Wizards of the Coast themselves, and how they're developing and promoting the game. Their overall strategy now appears to be to subtly push enfranchised players away from their game in the interest of profiting as much as possible. This can be most blatantly seen with their current "super mythic rare" alternate art card shtick that they're really enthusiastic about pushing, but (as of April 2017) their Amonkhet alternate art frame is by far one of the most horribly designed frames I've seen from Wizards. It's intentionally difficult to read as admitted by Wizards, and it's a massive execution failure as a result. It is a very blatant attempt to jump the shark and they've done this numerous times with regards to attempting to appeal to their Tumblr crowd, who aren't even their core players.

Another clutch that is really troublesome is their attempts to tightly control how Standard is played is detrimental to the overall long-term enjoyment of the game from a competitive angle. Granted I don't play Standard at all, but I know a lot of people who do and those who I've spoken to about it are generally displeased with the current state of Standard. There's also a noticeable trend towards dumbing down the interactions available in Standard in an attempt to broaden interest and appeal, but that just produces an increasingly stale environment. The fact that there's three cards currently banned in Standard and the format is still in a miserably unfun state is extremely concerning.

Still, as much as I want to get rid of my MTG collection, I simply cannot at this point in time. I've made way too many friends because of it and although there are times where I hate it, in the end I will enjoy it more often than I hate it. Having a good network of people to play with contributes a lot, especially with my local Legacy scene.

And when you can't find an opponent you can still spend hours building the perfect deck... my favourite part of the game.

Outside the fact that i hate the CCG business model, the game itself is more about the deck construction, then testing to see if your constructed deck works by "playing" it.

There are not a lot of possible decisions to make during a game. Play a land card if you can and with the mana available to you, pay for whatever card you have in your hand that can be played. Most of the time, there are no reasons to play differently. Mexican Train plays the same way to an extent... draw a tile and play whatever you can on the table.

Also too much luck-of-the-draw-based. Too many games are over before they even started because you drew too little mana or not enough monsters or other cards.

Almost every other games i played were more interesting than this. I believe i'd even play Monopoly over this.

'nuff said about this fantastic game! Just wanna add one thing that bothers me! You're forced to buy new cards over and over again to be able to compete with the new cards of your friends since new cards often have new abilities which you can't counter with your old cards! This game deserves a 10-rating in "Drawing money out of your pockets"!! But in spite of that one negative point it's still a fantastic game! I kept a few decks and sold the rest of my 2thousand cards 'cause I don't want to take part in that arms race anymore!

Owned in the sense that I have enough cards to play...not be competitive.  This would get a 10 if it weren't for the fact you need to spend a fortune to be competitive with this game.  It's probably the most clever game I've played and has near infinite strategy and variation.  That being said, the game isn't fun if you just don't have a deck that can win.  Also, having not played for several years, I would need to be schooled to learn all the new cards.

Edit:  Started collecting again and raised my score to a 10.  I now casually play a common/uncommon cube.  Discovering cube format gave it a perfect score for me.

RATING: 6
This game has the usual "card game issue" of requiring you to count cards, but it saves itself in that you can make your own deck out of quite alot of available cards.  Another problem is that in order to make a "fun competitive" deck it is going to cost you $100 or so.  In order to make a tournament deck, expect to pay much more.  When I play these games tha provide thousands of units/cards/etc options that you can buy, i just end up feeling ripped off in the end.  This game is no exception.  The concept of a huge number of options is great, but it is usually blunted by the sheer cost of "making something cool".

I'm generally not a fan of "collectible card games", but I've always liked Magic.  I feel a game should be based on your abilities and not on how much money you can spend on the game.  I don't like playing against people who have a hundred thousand cards and have spent years tweaking their perfect deck.  I don't have that kind of time or money.  (Though I do have over a thousand cards myself)  I am more inclined to play in a sealed deck tournament or a setup where everyone has the exact same cards and qualities to choose from.

RATING: 10
Really, with so many alternate rules and so much variation between format and number of players, it seems silly to call this a single game. 

Constructed is a bit rubbish - a fun game in principle, deckbuilding being half the game, but due to the method of card distribution, with players lacking most the cards they'd want to insert into their decks, it just feels like you're crippled.

Booster draft is fun but you need to devote an entire evening (4/5hrs) and you need a large number of people to make the time spent making decks worth it in terms of how many games you can play, seeing how your deck performs.

My 10/10 is for Zeddmore: a format recently explained in the forums. Allowing for drafting decisions whilst playing, allowing you to see a high variance of cards in different games, playable with a 'cube' of commons (in my case mostly Shadowmoor/Eventide I'd picked up drafting) and reducing the luck factor somewhat.

If Jungle Speed had new cards released periodically, I'd be buying them and playing that a lot more. It's the constant mutation of the game that makes playing this such a varied experience. Though you could get 'sucked into' this if playing standard competitively, I think that for Zeddemore, buying a bunch of commons every 1/2 years would keep the cube fresh. Since I'll still want to draft occasionally, that'll probably be my main source of cards.

If I let myself, I would have 1,000+ games of this played. This is a fantastic game--one of the best. I love constructing decks. I love drafting. I love trying to beat opponents who know their own decks inside and out.  But the cost of playing how I want to play (competitively) keeps this on the back burner. That doesn't diminish it's greatness, however.

One of the first card games of it's kind and being the one I have played on and off since its inception in 1993, Magic: The Gathering has always had a place in my heart as being the first game that I played with friends when I was younger. It's different formats, ways to play, and varying skill levels amongst players has been one of the best parts of this game through it's 25 year history and it will remain one of my favorite card games of all time.

RATING: 7
I dropped out of gaming for a while in the 90s when this hit big. My brother got into it heavily and I played a bit with him, but didn't catch the bug. My son got hooked later on, and I played with him too, but it still didn't convince me although I had fun. Once I went to a Friday Night Magic event with my son and a few people destroyed me while showing me what they were doing, and I have to admit I had been unaware of how deep the game could be.  Regardless, I have no interest in starting a new (and expensive!) hobby so I've kept away from it.

Probably the best game ever. Tactical, strategical and so much fun. I enjoy the deckbuilding aspect and I also love actually playing the game. Very well balanced (at least my favourite type Legacy).
 Its a game which can be played with a group of friends for fun (e.g. Highlander) but can also be played very competitive.
So many formats, so many cards, so many options...

RATING: 7
Indubbiamente uno dei giochi di carte più famosi e vari che io abbia mai conosciuto, ma per uno come me che ha iniziato a praticarlo, od almeno a provarci, è difficile riuscire ad arrivare a possedere un buon mazzo senza una spesa non indifferente..o dovrei essere stato proprio fortunato nell'acquisto di bustine. Anche i mazzi prefatti non sono proprio il massimo del risparmio e principalmente per questo motivo ad un certo punto mi sono fermato, vedendo che v'era troppo divario fra il sottoscritto e giocatori che partecipano a partite da interi anni e con dei mazzi a dir poco complessi.

Played this a lot in high school (1992-95).  Wasted lots of money on it, but had a good time.  Stopped playing it after I realized that the expansions would never end and I would always be trying to "keep up with the Joneses".
It was fun when it was new and there weren't so many cards and expansions. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Revised edition was fun to play casually. Can't comment beyond that since the CCG aspect of it turns me off and can be expensive to have the cards to play. Preset decks might be fun but not sure how quick those would feel outdated unlike FFG who currently has a longer card rotation.

Costs too much to play. Other than that, the best card game ever made.

RATING: 8
I have to say that this rating is absolutely biased. I've been playing it for years now and still love, love, love it. It clearly has problems newer TCGs or LCGs don't have, eg mana screw/flood ends games just because you got unucky. It still is one of my favourite games, and I don't think I'll ever fully stop playing it - I might take pauses every now and then, but I'll come back to it eventually.

Reading this, it might seem unfair of me to give eg Netrunner 'only' 5/10 - and it absolutely is. I might try to be objective when describing games, but at the end of the day my rating is just how much I subjectively like the game.

Incredible game botched by inept marketing and production by Wizards of the Coast and Hasbro.  While enjoyable to play, the continuous production of expansion sets and revisement of tournament rules makes organized play impossible for anyone with financial concerns (read: most everyone).  I play casual sealed deck with my wife sometimes even now; it is truly a fantastic game.

RATING: 9
Would've given this at 10 at one point in my life.  This is a great game.  It is more enjoyable if the people you play against are into it the same amount as you.  Can easily become the only game routinely played, and is variable enough to keep you coming back.  I've spent hours just going over deck designs in my head while working or driving.  I find it is fun to build decks, so this game gives you something to do when you can't find players.

RATING: 8
Phwooar. Counts as a board game? Old. Gold. A black hole for the wallet. Really great structure around the game for organised play from wizards of the coast. 

My first introduction was someone handing me a deck full of grizzly bears, giant spiders, and giant growths. Which quickly sucked me into the competitive scene and many a road trip to nationals, PTQs, and GPs. Great game, great community. Shame it cost so much and the emphasis these days has moved from eternity player points to annual points. (Makes sense from a commercial perspective though)

Back in Uni, I was looking for a way to get my non-geeky flatmates into roleplaying games, and came across this odd little card game (around Ice Age time, for the Magic geeks out there). 
Now, 20 years later, I have a whole bookshelf full of card storage boxes and still buy a box of each new expansion. I've done the tournament thing, done the 12 person multiplayer commander madness, and enjoyed almost all of it (lets not talk about affinity).
Rarely play anymore, but thoroughly enjoy it when I do.

Along with Vs. System, and Call of Cthulhu, these are the best CCGs created so far in my own estimation (having played many of them).

When I was in college, I was insatiable for M:TG (this was back right after the 3rd edition got released, right about when the game first took off).  I stopped collecting cards about 7 years ago and never actually did the tournament thing but I do occassionally crack out my plethora of cards and teach someone new how to play it for fun. Like a recovering addict, I now actively avoid CCG's because of the cost involved (I have played none but M:TG for that reason) but I still enjoy the game.

The best; WotC uses it as a money extraction scheme, but if you miss the game because you're obsessing over the cost of collecting, you've missed the boat. Screw collecting. Have fun.

ALERT:WotC has decided to take Combat Damage off the stack; I fear this simplification, besides being no damn fun, signals a determination to dumb down the game and chase the dollars of the Yu-Gi-Oh crowd.

Introduction of Legendary cards further emphasizes cards over players. Downgrade.

THE CCG. Solid gameplay, only hampered by the collectible aspects and the near-constant releases of new sets. Has a strong tournament following, but I always preferred casual play.

I'm glad I got out of it, as the game is highly addicting money sink, but the good times with friends and strangers alike were worth it.

Rates a 10 if you avoid tournaments and tournament rules and just want to have some quick fun with your friends. Rates a 5 for tournament play when one factors in the costs, an ever-changing and confused rulebook, endless errata, at least one broken card per set and the horrible sportsmanship typically exhibited by tournament (i.e. 12-year-old) players.

WotC's refusal to compartmentalize the sets led to some really wonky errata so that cards from Alpha will interact with cards from modern sets better. You can't manage a game that way, there are too many cards, it's just dumb. Fortunately, you can ignore such things if you're just playing at home.

Wow. How do you design a game that you continue to add rules to for years? WoTC did it and, for better or worse, created a whole new genre of gaming. The collectibility aspect is much-maligned, but that's because it worked! People, including myself, became addicted to it. Deck-building is brilliant and it adds to the experience a great deal. The multitude of card interactions is amazing. The designers of Magic: The Gathering had a fresh and original idea and they capitalized on it big time.

Speaking as someone who has played since "the beginning" (with Ian Borchardt's Alpha starter&booster) I think it got tired around the 10-year mark.  It may have reached the natural limits of the design space: the recent new stuff (e.g. Planeswalkers) seem more of an add-on from outside, than development.

EDIT: bit late, but I might start logging the play-sessions I have with the kids (now 10yo and 11yo). They make their own decks from "the collection", while I play from my archived block decks (from Ice Age through Time Spiral inclusive).  Good times, and memories :-)

This is a great game that is hopelessly marred by the endless flow of cash needed to play it. Building the decks is fun. Playing the game is fun. But losing the game because your opponent spent $1000+ on their deck? Not fun at all.

This is truly a shame, as the game is genre-defining and has transcended generations. Many FLGS wouldn't even exist if not for the rabid MTG fans and endless tournaments. MTG's influence on board game design cannot be overstated, yet its also cursed many with anti-consumer practices such as essentially gambling on booster packs, high second-hand prices due to forced scarcity, and an almost insurmountable competitive scene that either scares of newcomer or drains their wallets dry.

I traded all my cards away after finally coming to terms with just how much money was needed to keep playing.

I think Magic is a fun game, though I despise the collectability aspect of it.  It's not the money outlay that bothers me, though that is a problem for some.

RATING: 10
A time waster, a money sink, but still one of my all-time favorites. However, I absolutely refuse to get back on the "buy the new set" treadmill.

I think that one of the aspects of this game I enjoy the most is designing and building new and unusual decks.  I like building my deck before the game begins, not as the point of the game. I don't have the $$ to spend on the most powerful cards, so I play around with the "leftovers"   It's a real treat when you build a deck from scrap and it works exactly like you intended it to. That for me, is the real beauty of this game.  This is my go-to game for "deck building"

I guess this is my favorite "geek" game.  I absolutely love drafting.  I think it is because I am a game designer at heart and drafting is almost like designing a game.

With all the bad about CCG's aside this is really a good game. I prefer sealed block decks as collection and metagame can keep you out of a match. It is hard to keep up with the sets and cards as there are soooooo many. When I am familiar with all the cards to be played with (If I have memorized most of the block list) this is a favorite. This is the only game I have played tournaments which I found quite rewarding.

This game can't have an honest rating because it is so many different games.  As a normal CCG, it blows.  Solid deck construction, but brain dead play.  Not as brain dead as WoW, but there is still always a right card.  But the depth of the card mechanics make this the best possible Booster Draft game.  You need to know the set you are playing with, watch what cards are going to other people, and focus on a plan on your feet.  Open your last pack and see one of the set's uber cards in a color you don't have?  Take it, and then just casually lay it down face up.  Suck it, green players.  5 for the CCG, 8 for the Booster Draft.  I'll round to 6 since I'm not actually good enough to play it the right way.

The CCG that started it all.  I love this game!  This game loves my wallet. :(  If this were only a card game it would rate as 9.8.  However, there is an entire sub-culture around this game.  A tournament environment exists that is 2nd only to poker.  Win a PTQ, win money and an invite to the pro tour..where you can win big bucks.  There is nothing like the morning of the pre-release, waking up early and going to the tourney to bust open some new cards.  Ahh, I love the smell of new ink in the morning.  :)

Hardly ever play nowadays, but I have some great memories and stories.

This game really is the gold standard of CCGs.  Most are either too simple (Spellfire) or way too complex (L5R).  Richard Garfield really nailed it on this one.  Quite an impressive feat, considering it was the first of its kind.  Simply brilliant.

RATING: 9.5
I've been playing on and off for 17 years and think the design is very innovative and clever, and the strategy required is often deep, but it also has nostalgic value too.  I go in phases where I am either playing addictively or get completely out of the loop.  The one issue that frustrates me a lot is the financially exploitative pace of new releases and the high cost of dual lands and other utility cards often needed for multiple decks.  I also really hate the frequent marketing gimmicks like foils, mythic rares, etc.  Luckily these issues are more of a metagame problem, not really a problem with the gameplay itself, so they can be ignored while playing.  As such, I haven't factored this into my rating much.

It's awful hard to rate this game, as many have said: on the one hand, the initial set had so many great things going for it. Sitting down and playing the actual games was actually fun in itself. But the deck construction was the real meat. How much of your deck did you devote to resources? Did you focus on defense and have a larger stack in order to outlast your opponent [viable back in the early days]? How much to focus on speed, fast-playing cards vs. card economy of powerful ones? And biggest of all, how many of the five colors did you choose to include? 
 
That initial set was likely the best release. The vast asymmetries were great. Green had its powerful global effects, like tranquility and stream of life. Blue had counterspells, card-drawing, and strange card manipulations that could lock cards. Red had cards like fireballs, and mana barbs to damage anyone who used their lands. The creative possibilities were spectacular.

Those days are long gone. Now the game has devolved to a bit of a ratrace, wherein every month or two yet another set is released, and more credit cards come out to buy cases of cards chasing the few game-winning combos. At least it is well-supported, more-or-less balanced, and creates a community. But I must give credit where credit is due; this forever changed the face of the gaming hobby, probably for the better.

Legendary collectible card game (CCG).

Somewhat got trashed by new cards coming all the time but it also keeps game renewing all the time. Most games dont have tournament play on same level as MtG. Definitely one that you must see to know what is CCG.

The game that started it all.  But as the years went by, the expansions started to get more and more boring, and expensive too.  [Free] Digital alternatives also made buying the real cards less enticing.  But if you've already got a big collection, there's always the chance of playing again with a new person and a new deck.  But digging out my cards will be a pain... and prevents me from wanting to play it as much.

So many good times and good memories from this game.  Of course, so many good dollars have been consumed by it also.  I love the experience of tournament play, of all the stories, of going to places I would otherwise not visit and of all the paper I've destroyed scratching my latest and greatest decklist.  I still play and probably always will, but not to the extent that it use to be.  Best part of the experiences I've had with CCGs is the friends I've made.

This is the BEST game you should NOT buy.  It is a money sink, and it can suck you in and keep you from playing anything else.  I have yet to find a superior 2 player game, but it does suffer from a high learning curve which means the better player can easily get bored.  There is enough luck that anyone can win a single game or even a match (like winning a hand of poker), but in the long run the game is one of skill.

Wonderful 2 player game that can be very well balanced with thoughtful decks.

Have a spare 30 minutes?  Let's play!

I don't tend to like deck/army building games. Making an initial call based on some sort of Nash equilibrium on what you expect others to play is not my idea of a good time.

So, to use Magic psychographics, my Spike side isn't interested in the game at all, and I don't have much of a Timmy side. How does the Johnny side stack up?

Very well, it turns out. Magic is the only game I know of where you can assemble a combo that causes another player to lose an infinite number of times. With all the cards in the game, you have almost limitless options, ranging from simple-type switching and resource infinite combos to weird and wacky stuff with tokens and deck manipulation.

All of this is primarily an out-of-round, deck construction decision. Skill during actual piloting is less important. I'm fine with that; I don't like games where you've played well, but a decision you made days before means that you've lost the match before you start. If those out-of-round decisions are all there is to it, that's fine.

So Magic is probably the best constructable game from my standpoint. I'm still not a huge fan, and the pricing is a large hurdle. The game is still alright, and worth looking at if your preferences lie along those lines.

Great back in the day. Then Doug built the guarantee-to-win-on-turn-one-you-don't-get-to-play deck, and killed it. Now a scary big franchise; I do still respect the "base mechanics", but the 'rotating tournament blocks' means cards are "officially dead" much too quickly.

I have been playing Magic for a very long time. It is a very strong game with a lot of diversity to it. However in recent years it has become more about who has more money as opposed to is actually better at the game. There is a good amount of skill involved in the game, but with certain cards costing ten to one hundred times more than others it makes the game unbalanced for those that can not afford it. A few of my friends and I still play it weekly and we enjoy it.

The recent Time Spiral, Planar Chaos, and Future Sight block is the best work they have done since the pre-Ice Age days, and the card design and art is vastly superior to what it used to be.

What magic was and is are 2 diffrent things. Magic around 4th edition/ ice age. Well it was exciting and cool and everything you could want from a card game it was card crack.... until it wasn't. When format almost started getting solved instantly in standard and the cost of cards if you didn't magicly open them in a pack were bonkers because they were meta or they bought in planeswalkers which broke the game and didn't scale back with older cards. Magic has showed us cards games arn't meant to be expanded infinitly it just isn't healthy for the game. Hearthstone is currently undergoing similar issues. There will always be something awesome about the game having cards that bend the rules in such a way that you get to do things that combo out. However i think the peak of this game is behind us.

(Played 1994-1995) Hugely innovative for its time; the whole idea of customized card decks was brilliant (possibly inspired by miniatures games?).  Great idea of using resource land cards to play other cards.  But these great ideas were combined with marketing ideas of collectibility (the very worst form of it: rarity combined with blind purchase), which made it seem like much more of a collector’s product than a game (but from a marketing/profit perspective, this was also brilliant).  The game itself, using mostly non-rare cards, was addictive and fun, but ultimately a bit too repetitive and limited.  80% of the game’s strategy seems to go into deckbuilding (pre-game strategy) rather than gameplay (tactics), so that in-game decisions seemed mostly trivial, which to me is not as compelling--but is obviously a way to get players to buy more cards since that’s the main way to get more options and strategy from game to game.  For example, gameplay is very limited since players cant replenish played cards very fast and so have few options in the mid- to late game.  Another poor design feature is the randomness of drawing land, which is the essential resource in every game.  The game may have improved since those early years.

Magic: The Gathering CCG is a very good card game. 

It`s just a bit expensive for the wallet, just like another CCG. Especially if you want to play type II tournaments. You need to keep to date with what expansions are in type II since they change from time to time. After a while, some of the older expansions go into type I. Type I is any expansions are welcome. Some cards are banned in Type I.

Compared to other CCG's, Magic: The Gathering seems to be still popular and expansions are still coming out today. Lots of CCG's go out of flavor with time. They last a couple of years before you never hear from them again. Depends on what's popular. I stopped playing Magic: The Gathering CCG in 1998. 

I had fun when I did play Magic: The Gathering CCG. My decks were very good though I didn't have any Alpha, Beta, Unlimited cards. Started with the revised edition basic set.

My favorite colors to play were black and blue. I had a black only deck, a black/red and a white/green/blue deck.

I started playing Magic: The Gathering CCG when Revised was out. My favorite color of the 5 was Black.

SOLD MY CARDS.

Good.  I went through several phases of buying tons of cards, playing a lot, getting sick of not being able to keep up with Mr. Suitcase, and selling or giving away all my cards.  Then I discovered the secret: play with friends who are really into the game.  They'll have tons of decks that they'll happily loan you.  Borrow, play, return.

Granted, you lose the fun of deck-building, but for me that's a small price to pay for not having to spend money on cards.

Really though, it's a great game, and a brilliant one.  Richard Garfield contributed something genuinely new to gaming and entertainment, and he gets massive props for that.  I just wish it wasn't so expensive and time-consuming to stay abreast of the game.  Would be superb if it wasn't collectible, but then it wouldn't be the same game.

RATING: 10
The basic design for Magic is an incredibly flexible and deep game system. The fantasy flavor is also integrated into the mechanics of the game quite well, particularly for the five different colors of magic and the different themes they are each associated with. The difference between, say, black and blue is essentially undefined by the cards that produce the resource, but the way in which the spell cards define their respective color is quite impressive. 

Most of my experience playing Magic has been with constructed decks rather than limited formats. I've tried sealed deck a few times, as well as strange, homemade formats such as "Everyday is Christmas," but I've always preferred constructed when given the choice. For me half the fun of the game is building a deck and testing it out before running against my friends and their creations. When we first started playing (back in the days of Revised and Fallen Empires, so many years ago!) we generally limited ourselves to building decks based around the artwork or creature types of cards, but over time we shifted our philosophy toward different strategies and card interaction. We've never been truly competitive (I myself have never played in a tournament of any kind), but our game is stronger than it used to be. 

In my opinion Magic's golden age was Mirage block. Back then no one really called it a "block," since Magic community lingo had not yet developed, but those three sets (Mirage, Visions and Weatherlight) took the game to new heights to which the designers have, in my opinion, never returned. A lot of the mechanics of contemporary Magic can be found in these sets, such as the emphasis on shared cycles across all five colors, but those sorts of things were done in moderation back then, and the sets were designed around a theme or flavor rather than a game mechanic (such as 'Affinity' from Mirrodin or 'Madness' from Torment). Visions in particular strikes me as an incredibly well designed set, filled with innovative, balanced cards that promote diverse strategies and player interaction. Who doesn't love Man O War?

The biggest flaw in the game is the expense. Magic is an incredibly expensive game. Part of it is the "arms race" that develops in playing groups, where the acquisition of powerful cards by one player encourages others to seek out new cards for themselves. The near-constant release of new cards also encourages unhealthy spending habits, and the new-ish rarity system only aggravates this further. There are some pre-made decks you can buy, but if you enjoy deck-building that kind of defeats half of the fun. The shift to designing sets around a specific mechanic (Affinity or Madness) has also hurt the individuality of deck design by basically insisting on specific, linear card interactions. 

All that being said, I still think this is the best game ever made. I only play "pre-modern" cards, and in many cases stick to pre-Tempest as a way of keeping myself from buying new cards (the new card face being hideous helps out a bit).

The 800 pound gorilla of CCG's. Interesting rules and ever-changing decks make this interesting. Collecting frenzy and really expensive "power cards" make it not as fun. On the other hand, if I ever came across a big box of cards for ultra-cheap (like "here, take these"), I'd grab it in a minute.

I have a deck or two I bought at a thrift store, but if you want to mail me a shoebox full of cards, I wouldn't complain.

This is the game that started the whole collectability in card games, for better or for worse.  It also introduced a new breed of card game with many variations of key words/abilities and multiple victory conditions which is great.  This technically deserves a 10 but other games have improved upon what this one started. For instance, the resources can be an issue with this game compared to new games such as The Spoils and WoW TCG, heck the term mana-screwed was coined by Magic.  Yes, there were numerous types of dual lands that help consistency in multi-colored decks but it doesn't fix issues on whether you actually get those lands in your hand or not.  I've downgraded this from a 9 to an 7 after learning they now have 4 levels of rarity like WoW TCG.  The collectible aspect is still not as crazy as WoW but Magic's gone one step close towards that direction which is not good.

History of Magic:  

I started when revised/fallen empires was released and enjoyed it but couldn't afford to spend the money to make competitive decks.  We mainly just played for fun.  When Mercadian Masques was released was when I got back into magic seriously.  I collected Tempest - Invasion with major focus on Urza and MM Blocks.  I played competitively on a local scale and did well.  In the end I sold my collection for about $1200 CAN which was a nice recoup even though I'm sure it was worth more and I put more money into it.  I'm glad I sold when I did even though I truly do love the game.

Favorite Decks:

Ankh-Tide:  This was a type 2 deck (Masques/Urza) which I created after reading about the ankh tide combo.  I originally tried to make the Rishadan Pirates work with the combo but it didn't.  What did work was: Rishadan Port/Tangle Wire/Boomerang for early slow down, Anhk of Mishra + Parallax Tide for the combo, and Umbilicus/Tinker+Random Artiacts (ie Phyrexian Processor for control, Masticore for weenies, and other fun things) for abuse.  I think it was the only local blue deck ever made without Counterspell, hahaha.  I believe it had a few Misdirections though.  This was by far the greatest thing in Magic for me because it was something I created and it was decently competitive locally.

Suicide Black: This was a fun deck with the Phyrexian Negators and Tangle Wires, but it could do poorly sometimes.  I also liked trying black recursion decks with Hidden Horror/Exhume

G/W Rebelgeddon: This was MM Rebels + Blastoderms + Elves + Armageddon.  Fun times.

Creating decks and then playing with them can be a very fulfilling experience. Probably the game I have spent most time with, thinkning about, reading strategy articles on the net, building decks and of course playing agains others.

Would be rating this much much higher if Wizard would slow down their release cycles, it is impossible (and very very expensive) to keep up with.I have pretty much given up this game.

This is an amazing game with tons of support and formats.  One of the best TCGP (if not THE best) out there... but it also is VERY expensive and takes a lot to get into.  If you are into TCGP there is no better... but it is still not something I would recommend to all and think you might be better served getting a bunch of board games for a cheaper cost.  Still... I'm always happy to bust out my old decks and play a round (especially commander/EDH).

This is a great game at a number of levels. It was simple enough to be taught to me by a 14 year old, and the combined card mechanics can get incredibly sophisticated.

I'll be honest: I'm not a very good Magic player. I don't even play very often! But I love the game for its complexities, its interactions, and its flavor. I read design and flavor articles daily on the Wizards of the Coast website, and I get all hyped up about new releases.

I won't lie: this game is a money sink. Luckily it's easy to avoid if you know how. Most of my time spent playing is game is either a) at prerelease and launch party events for new sets, or b) with a casual group of friends playing the "Elder Dragon Highlander" variant that encourages wacky play with low-value cards.

For some reason I've never logged my plays of Magic. I'm not sure why.

I have a hard time rating this. Back in 1993-1995, I really enjoyed this game. I played it multiple times per week and in local tournaments. I had friends & acquaintances who worked for WotC and every reason to love it. However, the collectible card aspect quickly turned it into a money sink where having the power cards made all the difference. Even though I had some of the Power 9 and won a few tournaments, the "spend more, win more" concept got old. I put it away and probably won't touch it again. I want to give it a 10 for its longevity, how much I enjoyed it, and the thousands of dollars I made by selling a few of my old cards. I want to give it a 2 for too many sets, too many rule variants, too bloated, too expensive, and the whole CCG aspect. My rating reflects both sides. Purchased from various FLGS, OLGS, and gifted from friends.

RATING: 7
I created several decks about 20+ years ago because of friends, but I never really got into playing the game on a truly serious level. Most of my play oriented around occasional get-together games with friends where you took pride in defeating those who you grew up with. I believe my cards mostly consist of 3rd (revised), 4th, and 5th editions; plus, some 2nd (unlimited) and select cards from the limited Alpha and Beta releases as well as some expansion cards (Arabian Nights, Antiquities, Legends, The Dark, Fallen Empire, Ice Age, etc.). I gave away probably a thousand or more cards to friends at different points after I stopped personally collecting and playing, but still kept several of my favorite decks and some of my favorite cards. Unfortunately, some of my best and rarest cards I foolishly borrowed to a few (past) friends who played in tournaments and had asked if I could help them improve their competitive decks. As I grew older I lost contact with them so I probably will never see those cards ever again. I may have interest in trading some of my cards away, but before I do I'd like to see what kind of value they may hold -- I just haven't gotten around to investigating that yet.

Still one of the most brilliant game designs I have ever experienced.
Too bad for the 'collectible' nature, which makes it a no go for me since I sold my cards in the early 90's

Takes too much commitment and there are some issues with gameplay, but can certainly be fun to play more casually. For a while I thought EDH would fix my issues with the game but it created an entirely new issue of games stalling out to a standstill until someone finds a ridiculous synergy or combo to suddenly end the game in an anti-climactic way.

This game was cool and on the edge around 1997. Cool deck ideas were being created and prefected: the white weenie, the big blue, the stompy, the combo deck, the "mana curve". Crazy rule bending cards kept coming out. (what? I can be tapped out and still counterspell?) yet for all the new cards that have come out since then, the game hasn't changed that much. It's a dead duck game as far as I'm concerned.

A great game - but experiences may vary... There are problems.  Many people criticize the game from the standpoint of tournament play - I view the game as a game, first and foremost, like every other game, and view the tournaments as something else entirely.  My biggest problem with it is that, over the years, the plethora of cards has made it such that it's hard to build balanced casual decks, due to card interactions, and we don't want to just arbitrarily ban otherwise innocuous cards in casual play due to how they interact in specific circumstances (some cards don't play well with others).  Another problem is that, while it is a very deep game, and experience at the game radically changes the way one sees it, it's hard to get to the point where one can appreciate how much is going on in the game.  New players don't always 'get it', and don't enjoy it as a result.  It can be a chore to learn.

Nonetheless, I think it's probably one of the most awesome recreational activies I've come across.  Nice job, WotC.

The game of my youth. Many fond memories. Many dollars spent. I give it a five as means to average out the highs of learning to play and my initial deck and the lows that fifth edition and on brought. Kept my goblin deck for fun, but have minimal desire to play these days. I do enjoy looking back on my youth deck and thinking about how stupid my strategies were. A white-black deck, with a bunch of mediocre rares and no theme or cohesiveness? Really, Matt? Really?

The granddaddy of card games and I was there at the beginning:  Ice Age, Arabian Nights, Antiquities, Mox and Lotus.  I had tons of cards, cards that now could buy my daughter a year or two in college if they still were in my possession, but alas, I traded them in to a comic store back in the late 1990's and used the credit to buy DnD material.  I'm still playing that game, so I can't say I wasted my money, but I still cringe when I look at how much Moxes and Black Lotuses (Loti?) go for now.  Alas, the past.  It's the only thing guaranteed to grow the longer you live.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Magic has an enormous depth of strategy, which is what makes it so engrossing.  The wealth of cards and their interactions means that there is always something to think about.  What is more, since the majority of the strategy is in the deckbuilding, most of that thinking can be done in between plays.  Given its complexity its also surprisingly well balanced.  

Magic has its downsides, of course, including the luck inherent in a card game and the fact that it is more expensive than most board games.  Don't let the people who complain that they have wasted $10,000 on it scare you, though - as long as you have a little bit of self-control the expense can be kept quite reasonable.  I have played Magic casually for over 10 years and spent probably $200-$300 on it, which is not too bad considering the hundreds of hours of enjoyment I have gotten.  Granted, people who spend more money will tend to have somewhat better decks, but money actually isn't as significant a determinant of victory as is skill level, at least for casual play.    

So anyways, Magic has some downsides, but in my opinion these are more than overweighted by its good qualities: the depth of strategy, the beautiful theme, and the game's fantastic playability.  It's portable, has no set up time, plays relatively quickly, scales well to most any number of players, and is widely played so it isn't hard to find an opponent: no wonder it is the #1 most often played game on the Geek.  

Update 1/5/2012:  Now that I haven't bought any new cards for a few years, and don't have a steady stream of new opponents, I am finding that I rarely play this.  This makes me realize that it is even more dependent on novelty (either my new cards or my opponents') than I had realized, which lessens my respect for it.  That said, I am still more than willing to play if someone else asks.  Downgraded from a 9 to a 7.5

I stopped playing tournament and constructed formats after my time and money was needed elsewhere. I still play regularly, but from my ever-evolving, 2300+ card cube collection (Highlander: no duplicates) for drafting. It's essentially become another board game on my shelf for casual play.

I play 2-3 player Winston or Winchester draft.

I still own two decks (Elf deck and Elf Burn deck) but have not played in years.  I have pared down the majority of the collection and have a few unique cards beyond the two built decks.  The problem was when there were too many expansions being produced and the older cards couldn't compete with the newer cards.  Also, the powerful cards were too expensive to fully get and use.

What could I possibly say about Magic that hasn't already been said? An excellent game, and I love all the card art. Kinda grew out of it though; now I'll only play a match or two with very specific groups. (50+ unlogged plays)  *Sold off my collection*

The economic meta-game of MtG is terrible, but the cards are beautiful. If you win or lose it can be hard to work out whether it was due to playing ability, luck, or due to not investing enough money buying cards. For those reasons I would prefer Theseus or Ashes as a 1-1 challenge.

On the other hand, I have some great memories of playing MtG tournaments when I was in high school (Fallen Empires - Urza's Legacy).

I've been playing Magic for 18 years. I don't play it nearly as much as I used to, but respect where respect is due: This is one of the greatest games ever created! Magic transcended being a game. With tons of different variants and formats, Magic can be played and enjoyed on any level, from pre-made starter decks to power 9 decks with cards that total a few thousand dollars in value and everything in between. Over 11'000 different cards provide almost endless possibilities.

Used to play this quite a bit, but nothing compared to the crazy, CCGers who think that a game isn't a game unless it's a collectible card game (i.e. Yu Gi Oh, Pokemon, MtG, etc).  Mechanics so essentially simple that it's another one of those "now why didn't *I* think of that?!" concepts.  As daunting as the downloadable rules seem to the novice, it really is an easy to learn and (can be) quick to play, strategy card game.  Enjoyed it, but have moved on.  Also, not a fan of the whole "I have more money than you so I can afford more cards" sort of approach.  Matches with fresh sets are fun.  But the "nuclear proliferation" part of the mechanic is BS IMHO.

The most popular CCG, and with good reason - I'm nearly always up for playing a game!  I have about 20 pre-constructed [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/359860]theme decks[/url], which are a great way for learning the game or playing straight from the box.  Drafting is one of the best formats to play once you are familiar with the game, and you can [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/382910]make your own draft set[/url] with a playset of commons and uncommons (I have draft pools for 9E, TSP, and LRW blocks).  Elder Dragon Highlander is also a fun format (I have a RG Beast deck, and a UW flying deck), and can be particularly enjoyable in a 2 Headed Giant Format where you have partners playing each other.  Playing on Magic the Gathering Online enables playing with people around the world at any time of the day, and the Momir BASIC avatar gives you access to a casual format using every card in the game.  Unfortunately some of the artwork and themes of the black cards are distasteful.  There are so many different ways to play this game, that it's always fun.

Amazing game if not for the high variance due to resource (mana) issues.  Been playing pretty competitively on and off since 1997 - i'm a limited (not constructed) player and have built my own cube.  I play for spurts of 6 months until i overdose and need a break.  I inevitably return for a taste every couple years.  Rinse, repeat.  Currently on semi-hiatus.

Note that my rating fluctuates 7-9 as i cycle through high and low periods of wantness.


04/2015: I hardly touch MtG since discovering Race. At the end of the day, keeping up with MtG is too time consuming and too much micromanagement.

Magic is something unique in the world of fads and disposable games...a CCG that defies the criticism of jaded tools like me. Say what you want, but almost all of us play or have played it and we all have the scars to prove it.

Many adults still fly too close to the sun spending time with other people's kids at distances that border on inappropriate touching gleefully discussing card effects and rarity values with passion that resembles obsessive sports fandom.

Is it wrong? How would I know? I'm on the inside laughing at a subset of my own hobby. Yes I think it is stupid to constantly repurchase sets of cards because of the MtG tournament regulations, just like it is stupid to buy a new army with each revised WH codex. been there done that.

In the end is it harmful? No! It serves as an effective means of birth control by regulating the social habits of people that probably should not reproduce - ever. How else are you gonna keep these kids penned on Fridays and Saturday's without violating their rights. I say let 'em buy more cards and boost the economy while at the same time not muddying the gene pool with more kids with OCD.

Then again, there may also be a side benefit to all this...the next evolution of math geniuses may come from the ranks of the Magic players...could it be a covert op to unlock the next Einstein or Mandelbrot? Only J. Edgar Hoover's disembodied head knows for sure.

I'm not a collector of Magic and I'm not "in to it". Occasionally I like to play, but not with real Magic players. Because then it is for neither of us fun. I can't rate the game play weight, I think the combining of your cards to a special deck can be extremely heavy while the way I play it, it would be light medium or medium.

M:tG is like my dad's friend's line about New York City: "it's a great idea that got out of hand".

Back when I started playing, there were two types of power players in my group:

Those who build clever, effective decks
Those who used only the most powerful and expensive (to buy) cards

(I would have also said "those whose decks were loaded with proxies", but they're lower than human, so they don't count.)

Once I went to college where everyone was handed a laptop and broadband connection (unusual for 1998 - go SHU!), I discovered a third and most loathsome variety of player: the Netdecker.

Suddenly, the game wasn't about deckbuilding any more. It was just about collecting the cards to build someone else's deck.

Additionally, my group wasn't interested in 1-on-1 games. They only wanted to play 3-hour 10-player free-for-all marathons that were more about diplomacy than what's in your deck. (Exception: I designed a deck filled with mass destruction as a protest to these games. Much to my surprise, this deck never lost in a massive game, even when they were all against me.)

Finally, the game itself seemed to collapse under its own weight. Too many expansions, too many varieties of the same card and too much money spent wore me down.

I moved on to booster draft, which, to me, was the purest form of Magic. Problem was, it cost $10 a night and I'd get to play 3 matches max. That's not very cost effective in my opinion.

Thankfully, with the advent of the Planechase and Archenemy formats, WotC hasn't forgotten the casual player. At this point, I prefer the preconstructed decks for balance. Constructed formats otherwise just don't bring the fun for me anymore.

This sounds like I'm slamming the game time and time again, but I do love it. Nearly all of my closest friends I know because of M:tG even if we haven't played in years. I just find it hard to find people who want to play it like I do.

Gaming: I got all caught up in the collecting, and then realized that's where the excitement was. The game itself is really not as good as other games... or I should say the commitment/fun ratio is not as good as other games. It's good, but it costs too much time and money to keep up. The best aspect of the game is there are probably some MtG players in your town when there might not be another board gamer. Buy a couple decks on Ebay and play with your friends, but stay out of the rat race.

The game that started it all, and drafting is one of the best gaming experiences ever. Just wish it wasn't so expensive, otherwise I'd do it 24/7!!! Thankfully, newer deck construction games are replacing this for me. Regardless, I can't deny the impact this had on me and the gaming community overall. It's an evolution in game design! To this day I still enjoy dreaming up/ building decks for it even though I'm not really playing it anymore.

Ultimately, having to stuff half your deck with land cards is what keeps me away from this game. There's nothing worse than untimely mana floods or mana screws. Also, newer card game designs have been playing real well with multiple players right out of the box while still offering an insane amount of replay value. That and games with cards that offer multiple functions have made the options in a Magic: The Gathering duel feel dull.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I've been playing since 1997 and I think it's the greatest tabletop game ever conceived. The only flaw the game has is that its monetary expense is inescapable. New sets come out too often and card rarity is a sleazy marketing tactic which results in owning thousands of useless cards. The game's expense chases people away and keeps it from being little more than a cult classic. In fact, most non-gamers have never even heard of it, yet they all know what Monopoly and Yahtzee are!?!      Despite all of this, I'm still a fan and a game is always welcome.

Update 9/9/2011: Mythic rares are becoming too powerful and game changing. This isn't a good sign for the game's longevity.

What an amazing concept - and how fortunate for R. Garfield! :-)  Very strategic on many fronts: PLAY of your deck, BUILDING your deck, TIMING of play.  Discretionary income does give an edge - but no deck is perfect and the playing field is level if you focus on draft play.  Of all games I've played, this ranks among one of the highest for replay value.  Grade: A+

Addendum:  Since Garfield left, the quality isn't what it used to be.  The cards are too powerful causing duels to end much too quickly.  The end result feels like who gets the luckiest draw instead of a satisfying battle of wits.  What a shame as this was once an oustanding game.  On a positive note, it is still incredibly deep, and remains the "grandfather" of CCG type games though.  Current Grade: B

Having played a lot of Star Realms lately I see that Magic suffers from a late game where you have little choice on what you are doing, i.e. most of the game is decided int he deck building phase. As I'm not building or adjusting these decks anymore using them just isn't as much fun.

Still a massively great game but these days I have seen better.
What's not to like?
The Eternal formats will always keep getting more and more flawed, that is almost an inherent law with the format.
And also the ramp for mana is somewhat to slow in the beginning making for a few turns where you can easily get screwed quickly.

As I said, it is still a great game, but it is, in its' original form, just a 1v1 cardgame.

Also I don't like spending money every time I play a game, or spending money regularly to play a game, unless it's poker.  But it's a wonderful game.

230th playing: :star::star::star::star::nostar: - BattleCON is cheaper and even more my style.

Played 200+ times. Yes, yes -- I finally got around to playing this (June 2005 for the first time). And I enjoy it tremendously. I found ways to play it without spending horrific amounts of money on it: play online and only buy singles from trading 'bots; and for paper, draft for rares and uncommons, and trade your money rares for lots of cheaper rares. I love the variety of gameplay and I am a deck-building addict. I will say this though, I think my interest in Magic peaked with Ravnica block because I love the two-color pairings. Now that Colsnap is out and Time Spiral on the way, and it is becoming clear that two color cards are not going to be prevalent, my interest in buying new sets in waning. Good things I made about 40 decks from my Ravnica cards. =)

Aug 2014 (approx. 300th play): 9. Taught this (with very simple decks) to a friend hoping to have a casual Magic buddy. He enjoyed it decently, so maybe I'll be able to start playing again.

For several years was the ONLY card game. It's still one of the best, but I don't like to spend ALL my money on it to be an up-to-date player. Too expensive (and not even fun as the pre-mirage era).

It took well over a decade but I've finally fallen for this game.  Card draw can still be frustratingly influential on the outcome but it seems like there can be a lot of interesting decisions in each game.  Maybe not the perfect card game but still great.  So far I only play pre-constructed and limited formats (sealed and draft).

Update: I still enjoy playing but my pace has slowed down.  1) I don't enjoy how important draw order is.  2) I am burned out by the pace of expansion releases. 3) The collecting metagame bothers me.

I prefer playing PC versions and with friends' sets rather than getting onto the CCG treadmill that ends in poverty, but I can understand the addictive nature of this game.

Revisiting it, I'm disappointed by the randomness, dependence on having the right cards, and in-game shallowness of play. I like the fluff though.

A lot of the strategy is played out before you even meet your opponent in battle, in creating your deck. Getting the cards in the first place is a far greater challenge.

Newer card games have improved on the mechanical issues that Magic suffers from:
* inability to control your draws, resulting in mana screw
* stagnation and threshold behaviour in combat
* unstructured timing and stacked interrupts that spike complexity
* major mechanics being incredibly complicated (eg protection)
* having few decisions in-game, with a single way to play a deck and thus being decks being one-note
* not being geared for more than 2 players
* the lottery nature of booster purchases with a high financial commitment required
* placing most of the complexity on the cards with weak base mechanics

RATING: 10
[Collectible Card Game, Hand Management, Deckbuilding, Metagame, Fantasy, Best Game Ever] {2P:10, 4P Ettins:10, 3+P Mass Melee:8, Limited Booster Draft:10, Limited Sealed Deck:5, Limited Solomon Draft:10, Limited Rochester Draft:7} {Thousands of cards, beginning with Beta and ending with Weatherlight} 

The most brilliant game ever created. 

Don't confuse the game with the tournament environment / collector's market. Judge it on what it is: the creator of a genre, the savior of many a game store, and, perhaps, the true gamer's gateway game in more ways than Settlers of Catan ever was. Too many people believe that you need to have current tournament-class decks to play the game. That's pure and unadulterated hogwash. You don't need a Black Lotus or an Ancestral Recall to play Magic or have fun. You don't need to buy the latest expansion if you don't want to. An investment of $10 on a few thousand assorted commons and uncommons is enough for hours and hours of enjoyment. The land cards can probably be had for free! Make that your pool of cards. Everyone drafts from that pool, or just divvy up the cards by color and start building decks! If you want to get into the competition scene, you do so with open eyes and an empty wallet. Blaming the game, the game designer, and the company (Wizards of the Coast) is just plain stupid. What, they *forced* you to buy the game? They made it so that you can no longer play with the cards you have? Of course not. What's driving that desire, if you have it, is yourself and your lack of self-control. How do I know? I played MtG a lot years ago, when still engaged in competitive play. Gave it up, sold the big value cards, but still own thousands of them. I got out by choice, due to constraints on time, primarily, but the money saved was nice too. No regrets about playing at competition level. Fifteen years later, will happily play a pick up game when asked. MtG remains one of the most remarkable feats of game design and commercialization in the history of games. If there was ever a game that deserved a '10', unclouded by the prejudice of needing to have the latest greatest and priciest deck in order to have fun, then MtG is it. The game is one of the greatest in history; it not only defined a new category of games (and how many games can claim that?), it also singlehandedly got millions of people playing games face-to-face again. This is a '10' if there ever was one. For me, that will never change. ***UPDATE: Just played with the new Ravnika set, booster draft format. 10. If there was an 11 I'd give MtG that rating. Really hard to see how any other game can measure up in comparison.

RATING: 7.5
The fact that it is such a money sink really kills my rating for it. It could be a pretty neat game if there wasn't so much incentive to buy ultra-rare cards in order to beat people who have hundreds of dollars to put into a single deck.
However, my rating is pretty strictly based on "kitchen-table Magic" experiences. Fun game, and with enough cards, you can make some pretty fun decks that can get really creative.

RATING: 8.5
I play this game in a casual fashion (no competitive tournaments) with friends and I have a blast every time. The mechanics that gets added from every new set release keeps things interesting. The downfall for this game is that if you want to play competitive you will need a lot of money and time invested. That's the main reason I play this casually.

Received in trade. Constructed a cube made up of 500 4th Edition and Ice Age cards. Turns out that cube wasn't too good so I made this cube (http://magic.tcgplayer.com/db/article.asp?ID=8710) using proxies. That cube is much better.

Magic is a good game. It gets a bad rap with the CCG aspect, but played in a controlled card universe it really shines.

This game rocked my world when it came out. I played the HECK out of it, and gained and lost a number of powerful cards (mox gems and even the Black Lotus) before the hobby got serious about it. Then sleeves came along, antes stopped, tournaments and extremely tuned decks started to appear, and the hobby left me behind. I still play it from time to time, but I'm worried that if I do more than dip my toe in the water I'll want to dive back in.

The grandfather of CCGs.  It gets my respect, but not my love. There's a large disconnect between casual and tournament level play that makes switching from one to the other too big an investment of time and resources for me to make the jump from casual to tournament.  
As such, I've dropped out of play altogether as I did not want to try and keep up with the enormous card pool and constantly morphing errata.

Drains one's bank account, but it's very well-designed.  My only complaint aside from the cost is the fact that matches tend to be rather short.  I prefer longer games.

RATING: 5
Over the years I've played this more than ANYTHING (not limited to board games) except possibly Diablo 2 during one particularly boring high-school Summer. Magic gets a lot of things right, but it's definitely coasting on its classic status. The resource screw problems are worse here than in any modern customizable card game and you will never feel so enslaved by your deck as you do in Magic. But the value of Magic cards is too well cemented in the minds of folks who grew up in the heyday. Valuable Legacy cards have a sort of mythic glow.

What Magic gets right: stack interaction and depth of card pool. The former is a pretty incredible bit of game design and the latter is obviously just a consequence of having been the only survivor of the CCG golden age.

The game that started the collectible card craze... at least for me.  All other CCGs are fodder. A truly awesome game with beautiful card art.  I stopped collecting after the Revised (1994?) series but recently have broken out my dusty decks to play with a few old cohorts of mine.  It's hard to shuffle the deck without wincing as many of the cards that cost me just the price of a pack are now worth $20.00 to $30.00 a piece.  Eh... It's a game and I live to play games.

Played this from the beginning till a few expansions past urza's saga. It just became way too pricey. And most of the time when new expansions came out, me or many of my co-players couldn't afford the new cards so we would pit new cards against old and arguements and excuses always occured. Other than the price this is my favorite deck building game of all time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is so difficult to rate after all the years of playing as well as having many different formats. 
I'll probably never buy anything new because the collectable aspect is awful.
Drafting has always been my favorite format, but it's a huge money sink.
I'll still play EDH (commander) occasionally because I have friends that are nuts about magic. The last time I played it though I had a miserable time due to mana screw multiple games in a row.
That said I'll still give it a 7 because it's a solid game and for nostalgia's sake.

Note: It turns out that I really like M:tG when I'm playing out of the cube I constructed.

This is still an amazing CCG, but I've cooled on it recently.  New rarity schemes and unbalanced cards have driven secondary prices to ridiculous levels, and I still get tired of the lack of variety at constructed tournaments.

I tend to play this game in fits and start. As much as i love the gameplay and deckbuilding, the sad fact is the majority of the time the player with the most cards has a huge advantage. THe game is also a monetary black hole. If you can bypass these problems, via a budget, or by acquiring cards only through trade, then the game is excellent. I enjoy this game far more with more than two players, it helps to balance things out; more powerful decks tend to get hosed early.

The problem with this game is that most people who play it are really into it and know what they're doing. It's a game that excels when two people are at the same skill level. Considering that I don't have much interest in it I'll always be a step behind. I don't care for the game very much but that tidbit is what can really make it hard to play.

Drafting can be fun but the same problem as above applies.

Still easily the holy grail of CCGs (at least of those I've tried). I don't care for the collectible aspect (anymore) which means you really need to have opponents with approximately the same investment since more money often means better cards (although to be fair Magic handles card rarities much better than many other CCGs). Playing with fixed decks isn't all that great, either, since deck-building amounts to a lot of fun all by itself.
The new-fangled fixed set alternatives (read: Dominion) don't even come close, though.

PRO - Great game playing experience. Fun to create your own decks. Color themes were each unique and engaging. Mechanics were simple, fun, and innovative (I got out after Ice Age). Had a ton of fun playing in groups. Probably will never play again, but rate it based on my past experience.

Without a doubt the best (card)game I have ever played.

Getting to know the numerous cards, designing your own deck with combinations which you thought would work well and then testing your new deck against a deck of a friend.

A very tactical cardgame which required knowledge of the cards, quick thinking and (occasionally) a good poker face.

I have played this game for many years before I parted with my cards (with exception of one deck). 

Why did I stop playing? In order to keep up with the game you had to keep on buying new additional cards.

Like a lot of other folks, I succumbed to the Magic craze in the early 90s and played the hell out of the game from the Beta release through Legends, at which point I sold off virtually all of my cards.  Since then I've been off the wagon and I recently got my 10 year chit from MtGA.  Ahem.  In retrospect I should have held out to sell some of those cards later in life - yes, I had a Black Lotus - but I can't say I regret it.  I still have a few cards left, including most of an Ice Age starter deck that I picked up for a release tournament ages ago, but that's about it.  Recently a friend and I sat down with my remaining Unlimited cards, where I have just enough to make two functional five color decks, and had one hell of a great time playing with them for a couple of hours.  It was nostalgic as all hell and reminded me of the very early days of the game, but I can't say it's driving me to go back to playing on a regular basis.

====

I was snobbish towards MtG for a long time and missed out on a very fun time as a result. While my older son and I like the game very much, we don't play to compete. Instead, our MtG play is limited to Duel Decks (Monsters vs. Heroes is great), budget 93/94, "story decks", and pauper drafts. MtG is reviled by many for its nature as a money sink, but we spend very little money on it and have at our disposal an incredibly deep gaming experience.

2014
====

I came to MtG very late after a somewhat snobbish attitude earlier in life.  I'm eating a ton of humble pie because this is an amazing and incredibly rich game.  That said, I am not at all interested in the collectable aspects.  Around my house, we tend to play as follows:

 - Grab a few boosters whenever a new set comes out
 - Draft from the 1500+ commons that I bought for $15
 - Use proxies for the exceedingly rare cards

Magic is the perfect game for me. There is always something to do, whether it's playing, trading, building decks, or collecting it keeps me busy and happy whenever I have time.

I have been playing since 1993 and have almost everything including some power. I'm always looking to play/trade with anyone.

I am also a dealer so will consider buying collections and singles.

+ I was able to get up to speed quickly. I last played the tabletop game back in the mid 1990s and played Duel  of the Planeswalkers on Xbox 360 a couple of years ago.
It was also easy (less the 10 minutes, maybe even 5 minutes) to teach to my kid (who plays Pokemon).
+ The art is fantastic.
+ The game is a classic
- Cards wear down quite easily and will need to be sleeved if you want to see a lot of play out of them
-/+ Collectability can be a negative for many. However, there are many ways to play without breaking the bank: theme decks, all commons and/or uncommons decks, cubebuilding and cubedrafting  

[i]Dec 2012:[/i] Just can't get enough. MtG (especially MtG Online) has consumed most of my gaming time. Upgrading Rating from 8 to 9.
[i]Nov 2012:[/i] Started playing again with M12 booster battle packs. M:tG is a much better game than I remembered. Changed rating from 5 to 8.

Fiarly simple play and the division between strategy types is nice (black is mostly damage and "necromancy", white is motly healing, etc.) Of course, further releases can make the game increasingly complicated.  There are also some fairly annoying game-breaking stragies in some formats.

Have played for many years. I still love the game but recently began budgeting more of my entertainment dollar away from Magic and towards other board/card games. Wish I could find opponents. Quick, portable, engaging. I've easily spent more hours playing this than any other game or any other hobby for that matter. I've gotten many, many, many more times the pleasure and joy from my cards compared to their cost (admittedly, not cheap however). I'm a little surprised it's not rated higher on BGG. I've been lucky enough to live in several places around the world and wherever I've lived, my Magic cards have made me new friends. As just a casual player, I've probably taught at least 50 people to play. I don't know if that's alot but it seems like alot to me.

I started playing around the eighth edition and continued until Time Spiral.

A really, really good game.  Every once in a while, I'll pick up a pre-constructed deck at the store and play it a few times.  I miss out on building custom decks, but the precons are fun anyway.  You don't _have_ to go the whole "collector" route.  Sometimes I'll go mooch a game in the trial area of Magic Online, where you can always play one of the current five one-color 40-card "theme decks" for free.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This game would be a 10 if it had come in fixed sets. The problem is its collectible nature.
 
1. He who has the most money has an advantage over players of equal skill. 

2. It is difficult to build any deck you want without resorting to proxy cards or going into the outside market.

A second problem is WotC's banning of cards from tournament play rather than issuing errata for them. This often means that the most desirable cards from a given expansion often drop from tournament play before the rest of the set does. Often the problem is conflict with a new card having unanticipated uses. Rather than banning the new card which is relatively easily available they will banish the old one which tournament players have gone to great effort and/or expense to obtain.

2 points off for collectible and 1 for the banning of establish cards in favor of the new.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Yes, this game is hideously expensive to try and collect or play competitively.  However, I can recognize great design when I see it, and this is truly the pinnacle of CCG design.  Open, flexible, with lots to explore.  When you build a deck, unlike other CCGs you are given a clean slate.  How do YOU want to win?  Then build it.  One of THE greats in game design, hands down.

This is by far the best Trading Card Game to exist. Anyone who is giving the game a bad rating obviously doesn't either like CCGs or doesn't like the complexity and high-level of skill to play this game.

provavelmente o melhor jogo de sempre e o facto de nem se quer constar do top 100, faz-me acreditar muito pouco neste sistema de rating

é incrível como as pessoas odeiam tanto este jogo, simplesmente por terem gasto demasiado dinheiro nele (hoje derretem o dinheiro no poker online)

no meu formato preferido, booster draft e sealed deck, nunca foi preciso investir muito dinheiro, às vezes até é possível ganhar algum

e as cartas comuns permitem jogar infinitamente com o mesmo prazer

actualmente já não jogo e confesso que nunca gostei muito dos jogadores de magic, mas isso não faz dele um mau jogo, além disso também sempre dei pouca importância ao universo 'salada de frutas' do magic... quero lá saber dos orcs e dos goblins e dos vampiros e das magias, o jogo é bom, ponto final.

I discovered this game when it first came out and have had a lot of fun with it over the years, but wouldn't really want to play it much now.  There are too many other ways I'd rather spend my time and money.

The "game" here is mostly in the deckbuilding. Actual play involves few meaningful decisions and comes down to the luck of the draw if decks are evenly matched.

RATING: 4
I do enjoy playing Magic and respect that the game was a pioneer of many elegant game mechanics many years ago. But the fact that the game is still relying on boosters (compared to LCG like Netrunner), is out-dated and is not helping newbies to get in. The gameplay is not helping whoever is lagging behind to get back in which can lead to scores like 20-0. Also, the resource system is just not very elegant. And I would be ok-ish if it was an old game, but it is not, they are still issuing new mechanics every year but are not modernising it.

One of the few card games that really was one of the greatest games out there. With an ultimate replay value and an abundance of cards to collect, magic has stood the test of time. However recently, cards have been in my opinion too good and has ruined the certain factors of the game. Magic has passed its prime and adapting to a new style of gameplay which just doesnt mix well with my tastes. It's safe to say magic was a truly great game, unfortunately the future of such a card game can never truly be the same.

To say I own Magic the Gathering is rediculous.  I have quite a few cards, but I will never own the game.  I started playing relatively recently.  My first set was Rise of Eldrazi.  I then quit Magic as I hated the next block.  My abandonment was cut short when I saw Innstrad. I loved Innstrad, and stayed in long enough for Return to Ravnica. I have cards from RtR, but I don't care about them.  I still play my Innstrad decks, while the others I just store.  I've decided to play blocks I like and skip the ones whose theme doesn't harmonize with me. I will buy more cards, but not from Theros. We'll see from there.

[b][i]Magic[/i][/b] is a 2-player card duel that is crazy prominent (and, along with miniature games, is probably the reason we still have FLGSs). In my opinion the gameplay of Magic pales to similar games (e.g., Android: Netrunner, Game of Thrones, Blue Moon, Summoner Wars, ...). The extreme breadth of cards gives Magic a wealth of deck-building options, but competitive decks are easily found online. Worst of all, Magic uses a blind-buy distribution model (although I do understand that many enjoy the draft play that's possible with such a model).

However, these things aside, I like Magic as a quick game to play with a wide range of close and distant friends; this is only possible because of Magic's prominence, simple-ish game play, enjoyable theme/artwork, and constant development. The good times this has brought single-handedly makes Magic a game I would recommend if you had a group of like-minded friends. Here's the recipe: Buy a few pre-made decks (to negate the moronic distribution model), grab some friends, and have a night of relaxed gaming fun.

I played Magic from 1993 until around 2000.  Had great fun with it.  Finally lost interest... probably because the constant new expansions were too much to keep up with.

I've played magic for around fifteen years, however I haven't purchased any new paper cards in nearly ten as I don't often get a chance to play in person. I almost exclusively play online and have built a fair collection of digital cards. I only keep my paper cards around for the rare occasions when I get together with old friends or attend a gaming session/convention where I an opportunity might arise to strike up a game. I love just about everything about the game except that over the years cards have become more overpowered and the rules have been dumbed down.

RATING: 6.5
The defining fantasy-themed card game for the last two decades.  Leader of the pack and imitated by many.  Unlike a fine bottle of wine; however, IMO this one seems to grow more sour with every added expansion.  The classic cards, such as the Serra Angel, are all but obsolete now.  Regardless, Magic is still very enjoyable when played using opposing decks of the same caliber.  Much of my high school allowance went to playing this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The world's most famous TCG, sure, but I can't get over how easily a player can get fine strategies screwed by bad luck on the draw, not to mention the money sink Magic can be. Modern games just do what Magic does so much better - popularity isn't everything.

RATING: 7
A classic that has hold it's power quite well. Tactical hand-management and deck-building was just something awesome and freshing in 1994. The collecting part (and also some bit too powerful cards) was something I didn't like that much and it was the reason why I sold my cards in 1997. 
Anyway it's still a good game and I'd like to trying some of the newer expansions and they rules.

I used to like this a lot - back when all card games seemed boring and M:TG shone like a bright beacon in the dark. Then I realized what a money-sink this game could be. Then I realized what a time-sink this game could be. Later I found other, much better card games like the first Star Wars trading card game, then Kung Fu Fighting and now Dominion. Kung Fu Fighting wins for being small and having everything you need to play with a group, while Dominion wins for being the best card game ever.

It's a very nice game, however, I don't like that shuffling has a lot of impact on how the game will go and I don't really like collectible games, as I would prefer having more board games instead of more cards for the same game. In addition, you need to spend more time building different decks and I'm a bit too lazy for that. However, the design is very nice, easy to learn basic rules and (if you spend more time to prepare your deck) leaves you a lot of room for different strategies.

The rules are outdated. Easy to learn and play, but sadly a lot of luck in drawing cards involved, since you only get to draw a card per round, if you don't include card draw in your deck.

RATING: 6.5
A huge game that doesn't need my introduction, too many nuances for me to go into, suffice it to say that it is a game that has infinite options.  Two negatives: It takes a dedicated crazy sort of person to build decks to play and this deck building is where much of the infinite options takes place and two, the initial outlay for this game (especially at the time when I gave this a go) is just too much!  But nowadays you can get a whole stack of older cards (which is fine) for next to peanuts.

RATING: 8
A great game, there is no denying it. Customizating your deck, playing against different opponents and figuring out new, interesting card combinations is great fun. Still, I do not play M:tG. It would take couple enthusiastic opponents to make it work. And I fear that if I got really into it, it would take too much of my time away from other games.

Cardboard crack. Played for about two years and sunk way too much money in this (although probably a lot less than most).
While the game system is genius, Magic does have some meta issues. I have kept a handful of decks and might play once in a while when meeting fellow former addicts, but won't actively look for games.

One of the best game mechanics ever designed - simple rules, functional yet very appealing components including some of the very best fantasy art available, and very easy to set up - all you need is a deck of 60 cards plus a few "life point" counters. Game play is very tactical and the deck building and instant card effects adds "fog of war". The game is however a "collectible" card game and players need to realise and accept that collecting cards (which means spending a lot of money on an ongoing basis) and deck design is an integral part of the game. The collectible nature of the game is a game in itself - a wonderful part and a major negative as well given the ongoing cost but does not change the fact that this is a very good game.

Had all the early cards (first set plus 4 editions) but sold them off to fund the rest of my game addiction. Only have a small collection now but love this game.

RATING: 6.5
I'm not sure what happened to this once-great game. Maybe WotC got too big or too greedy, or maybe I graduated middle school and learned to talk to girls.

In any case, the mechanics and balance were both mostly great until about Mirage. If you can find or print old cards and play casually, it's still a good game.

If you're attempting to stay current, you'll find a game that's no longer possible to balance, and as expensive as a crack habit.

RATING: 10
OK, revised my 1 rating since I bought some cards and played in a controlled environment. In that setting, the game is actually pretty freakin' fun.
---
The 1 rating is because of the "spend more money -- get better!" mechanic of the game, which I think is absolutely broken.  Other than that, I liked setting up decks and playing games for a year or so.  Eventually I threw my all cards away, sigh...(Unlimited Edition).

The game about changing the game to one your opponent can't win. You don't just break the rules, you smash them and create completely unique situations. 

Taking turn after turn, mindcontrolling the opponent, discard, resurrecting monsters from your discard pile, cards that prevent you from losing or win you the game in the spot, goblins, wizards and more crazy stuff

What a great idea.....When it came out in 1993, it was perfect timing to put the board games away because of all the babies around at home and at friends.  Fast to play, fun to build the decks.  I'll never get serious about Magic tournaments, too many cards to buy!  I do like the sealed deck and boosters and drafts, since here at least you have a chance if you don't spend a lot of time building constructed decks for Type I, II, etc.

RATING: 2
This is an OK at best, 2 player only, game sucked up by people who are drawn to decent artwork and the &#039;collecting&#039; frenzy.

I remember laughing out loud at all the poor saps that were bringing suitcases of cards to GenCon and Origins the years after it&#039;s introduction.  If you want to blow a huge amount of money on a game that is unbalanced (if not, then why would there be any need for thousands of cards and a huge cash outlay to get them?) then get into this game.

I&#039;ll hand it to Richard Garfield for catching all the kiddies at the perfect time as all the other collectible markets were in the dumpster he picked or lucked upon the PERFECT moment in time. But then again he has a mountain of cash that he can laugh right back at me with.

The much better game that he was trying to get marketed before Magic was (RoboRally).

I&#039;ll also thank Richard for allowing me to cash in on the collectible card games fad while it lasted... I bought plenty of Alpha and Beta first edition cards for this while I could and sold most of them for far more than they should ever have been worth.

I played this up until Ice Age: Alliances, and sold my collection for a hefty sum.
I dabbled a bit a few years ago, but the sheer bloat and number of cards was way too much for me to handle.

It was good back in the day, but it doesn't hold any interest for me any longer. I could be convinced to play again some day. The ridiculous investment, and card bloat is crazy enough I'm not likely to ever touch this game again, unless my kids develop an interest.

If you spend an insane amount of money to remain competitive in a game which rotates now every 2 years (wow), "playing" this is about building your deck and then playing rock, paper, scissors, lizard, Spock.
If you don't spend an insane amount of money is just playing rock against paper.
I guess playing casual it's ok, but even then most of the hands play themselves, so what's the point: there are hundreds of better games out there in which there's actual strategy involved. Mediocre game by today's standards; just to name a few issues (besides it's a CCG and I'm no longer 12 to spend time trading cards): broken combos, myriad of banned and errated cards, obscene advantage for the first player, flawed engine relying on land draws...

Besides, most Magic players I've met are blind fanatics who refuse playing anything other than Magic (few of them know about other games), so I guess this Magic thing, as famous as it is, it's actually doing more harm to the gaming community than benefit in the long run. This is more a business than a game.

No other ccg has ever come close to the success of this game.  The only reason I stopped playing was the dissolution of my old group.  That and my wife was going to divorce me if I didn't stop sinking money into it with every new expansion!  Excellent, excellent game!

Deepest and most interactive card game I have ever played. It gets a lot of unwarranted hate on BGG because it is a CCG, but despite that the game design is brilliant and as more cards are added to the pool it gets better.

The grand daddy of collectible card games.  Entertaining game play and relatively easy to learn (at last!). The big drawback with Magic is the temptation to keep buying new cards to make new and better decks which pushes the meta-game to a handful of archetype decks you end up seeing over and over again. For social play however the pre-made commander decks are brilliant straight out the box and provide good value and hours of fun.

Played on iPad. Good card game, but unnecessary complicated execution of game mechanics (typical for Garfield's games) and collectible aspect keeps this away from being great game. The only big reason I would never buy this game is that winning is based on how much cards you have learned and played and how much money did you spent for your cards. :)

Those who call this a money pit should shut up. The number of boardgames they buy often equals the amount spent on magic cards. Plus I love the personalization that games like [i]Magic[/i] and [i]Warhammer[/i] give players. A deck or army you construct is your own.

A brilliant game that became too popular for its own good.  I would probably still be playing fanatically if not for the CCG economics, the excessive rate of card/rule expansion, and the way that the internet squelched the game's creativity and killed the art of deckbuilding.

If you've come late to the party, then don't bother to RSVP. 
Android Netrunner is the spiritual phoenix of this ultra-nerd-fest bonfire of the vanities, so go check out that game and leave Magic to the ravenous fanboys who only want to get you involved so they can hook you into an expensive ponzi-scheme of card collecting. When you realize there are combinations of cards that ultimately break the game, and that your "buddies" already have those cards built into their killer decks, you'll feel like an idiot. A broke idiot. But only after you've gone too far down a gilded rabbit hole that leads to shut-in, self absorbed "I win" deck building.
AVOID.

Only really enjoyed the competitive side of MtG. Mostly Legacy or '1.5' format. Training to stay competitive took too much time though and I decided to give up the collection in favour of other games.

The strict rules and judge system of MtG competitive gaming is the best out of all card games - maybe of all games period. Especially taking into account the high complexity of the rules.

Of all collectible card games MtG is still on the top and I don't expect that to change very soon. But to stay competitive, this cardboard heroin will take all your time and money - probably social relationships too.

Played 2+ Paid £19 for a "Fat Pack" 120 cards that me and my son tried to make 2 decks from. No instructions with the game. I worked through the online tutorial. I gave a Sunday afternoon up to try to get started as a magic player. I just don't get it, the effect of every other card’s special ability is a pain to work out and the whole exercise of making a deck is not what I want to do with my free time. I just wanted to buy 2 well balanced 40 card decks with clear rules. I dipped into a couple of the MTG fan sites and I don't want anything to do with it. At 40 I am not target audience so my negative comments are not going to bother anyone. March 04

2-6 Players.  Best game ever invented.  I enjoy the format of 2 vs. 2 for optimal fun and strategy.  Booster Draft so that the richest player doesn't always win.  Crucial decision making even when it is not your turn keeps you on the edge.  You can be down to one point and come all the way back to win.  To all of the nay-sayers I say that you haven't given this game a chance or haven't played in the right format.

RATING: 10
Some ungodly number of plays, seven years so far.

This game is what epitomises a 10 for me, I will be playing this game for the rest of my life, from casual play with younger children to competitive tournament play. The gameplay is excellent, honed over 23 years I have no point upon which I think it could be improved. What I do recommend is that if you are any degree of a serious gamer, play a constructed format rather than the very underpowered preconstructed decks you can buy. Precon's are fun for play with young children or people who like a more simple game, but it lacks the full depth or interesting mechanical interactions. 

Highly advise buying a pauper format deck online or in paper. $1-70 for a deck online and generally less for a deck in paper, avoids the expensive rares needed for other formats and still provides a high level of interaction and ample opportunity for deck brewing.

Finally, there is an ethos and community to the game that I can barely begin to describe, I've met many friends and lived many unique experiences through Magic. Going to Tuesday Night Magic is something I could have fun with even if I lose every match just because of how much I love the community.

I will be playing this game for the rest of my able life.

RATING: 7
I use to really love this game but whyen my rare collection of magic cards got stolen it pushed me away from this game.  Also when this happened I wasn't really playing much anymore.  CCG games still sound fun but I would sooner try a living card game from FFG or  get Dominion.  Collectible card games no longer appeal to me at all.

Update: I recently played the Xbox 360 version of Magic and this rekindled my interest in the game and therefore I raised my rating.  Part of me feels like getting involved again but I remember how much money I drowned into this last time so I'm holding back.  Living card game seem neat but the amount of packs that come out is intimidating since i'm a completionist.

RATING: 7
One of the best of its generation.  It dragged me screaming and kicking into a world of fantasy gaming that I had previously 'cocked a snook' at.  In my decaying mind it is forever associated with the warm summer weekends of '93. The relative simplicity and the range of possibilities, strategic and tactical, really absorbed me and my pals for countless hours.  

But it suffers from the same problems all CCGs are destined to suffer from; luck of the draw (although there are ways to overcome this somewhat) and convolution, driven by a need to sell new sets of cards.  Oh for those simple days of yesteryear.

Lots of fun when I was a kid.  Then, fun again when I was in college, until a roommate brought his cards from his high school years.  I realized that Magic was just like the others...newer expansions beat older ones.  More money trumps all.

Turned into components for PnP games.

Once upon a time, I was really into this game. Now, I'm back.

While the gameplay isn't quite as tense as (say) Blue Moon, the fun of this game for me is in the open design structure. I'm really looking forward to getting back into the world of deck design.

A nearly perfect game that gets no love on this website. To avoid the trap of constantly buying new cards improve your deck, don't play competitively. Buy pre-canned decks (the starter decks, or duel decks, for example) and have a blast. It's the perfect 2-player game. MTG is the inspiration for nearly every card-based game that's in print today.

RATING: 7.5
The mana mechanic is a big problem of the biggest card game ever. Like a third of all matches invole one player drawing  no or only lands, rendering them pretty passive. These matches are just no fun at all. 

Then there's the fact that it's just incredibly expensive and in a gaming group there's actually the problem that the person who has the most money can afford better decks. 

By now, magic is kind of a filler game in our group. So much wasted potential for such obvious cashgrab reasons...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
It's a good game, but with thousands upon thousands of cards, very complex rules (if you play at a tournament level), and an incredibly high startup cost, it's something you've got to devote a large chunk of your life to.  I probably spent about a thousand hours and a thousand dollars over a period of a few years on this game (many people commit much, much more), and I still was a low-tier player -- I could neither anticipate my opponent's strategies because they could be using cards I had never seen before, and my less expensive cards simply could not compete.  As far as creativity goes, Magic gets a high rating from me -- the mechanics of the game are very well-done, and the CCG format was an extremely innovative idea copied by many, many game designers.

A great game that had me hooked straight away. Unless you have the money to keep adding to your collection and/or have a variety of opponents it can start to lose it's appeal. Not one for non-gamers due to the potential time and money involved.

Edit: This game is superb in terms of the fun to be had and the thought involved in gameplay etc. Forgetting the fact that it can be expensive the game itself deserves a rating of 10 in my eyes.

The only way to win, is not to play.  I consider a game in which the player who spends the most money wins, to be clearly broken.  I know, I know, play with sealed decks.  I consider I game that I have to buy every time I want to play to be clearly broken.  And no, building a deck is not a game.  I'm sorry.

I've been playing this game on and off since 1994/1995 (7th grade), when Revised, 4th edition, Fallen Empires and Ice Age were all causing me to burn through my allowance and earned money like a junkie.  Anyone who plays knows what I mean.  As I grew up, I relapsed time and time again to add to my collection with the advent of new rules and abilities, and interesting themes of new sets.  Love this game, with all of its dirty addictive charms and all.

I played this game when it first came out and I was quite young.  Then, my Magic cards sat in a box for almost 15 years.  When I rediscovered board/card games I knew I didn't want to get back into the CCG thing because I know what kind of a financial stress the addiction can cause.    I considered this game too sloppy, that it depended on the player to put in all the work to organize the cards and the player who had the "best" cards and who spent the most time organizing his deck would almost always win.
However, the allure of the Duel Decks was pretty irresistible.  Here were two decks, gorgeously organized, playtested for a perfectly balanced game and it cost as little as a standard cheaper board game.  I picked up Phyrexia vs. The Coalition and loved it.  I thought, here is Magic really shining.  I've also purchased the most recent pair, Elspeth vs. Tezzeret and have found it to be a lot of fun too.  For me, this is the new way to continue enjoying what is a great game.
---
More recent explorations in Magic include the DeckBuilder's Toolkit.  I thought I had found my new niche for this game with the duel decks, but I forgot how much fun it is to build a deck.  Even (especially?) with the limited cards from the toolkit, you can build a large variety of decks and if your opponent is working from the same resource, I think it's a fair battle.
---
I've rated M:tG a 9 because I do love to play and I love constructing decks (from my modest supply), but Magic is not without its flaws.  In fact, several games have done a lot to fix the problems people have with Magic like getting too many or too few land cards (usually eliminating random mana draws) and card balancing.  However, Magic just has a certain charm to it that no other game captures.

What can I say about the addictive power of this game!!! Introduced to this game as a student, by a friend who had bought the original (beta) Limited Edition, I was soon hooked and buying box after box of Unlimited Edition and later expansions. I stopped around the 4th Edition stage, with a brief resurgence when Tempest came out, but have hardly touched the game since! My collection contains a few highly sought after cards.

Rating is based solely on the early sets when, for me, this game was in it's prime.

Magic the Gathering is the "legos of gaming" because you can do so much with it. Truly a gamer's game. A designer's game.

Magic is the only game I can honestly say I am always willing to play.

I still fondly recall my first game of magic when Stuart came to my house in January 1995. Made Australian Nationals top 8 in 1997 and was in the national team in 2004 playing at Worlds in San Francisco. Played Magic Online on numerous occasions. One of the greatest game experiences in my life. Up there with first plays of Talisman, Ultima Online and World of Warcraft.

RATING: 5
The game itself in its basic form I like very much. Deckbuilding is a very deep strategic challenge. When playing, the sometimes very difficult decisions that need to be made are fun and challenging. And the art is unparalleled.

However, because it's constantly being expanded, the investment to stay current is astronomical. $500 USD per year is a lowball (as of 2013). Think of all the *other* gaming you could do with $500. Add in the vagaries of the rules and the irate tantrums of some of the players, and you end up with a game that is a fun strategic challenge that I will probably never want to play except occasionally, with people who have outdated decks as well.

I normally don't mind randomness in games, but in this game it was down right annoying.  From a game where no land could be drawn, to a game where land was being drawn but only the most powerful cards (which needed even more land get drawn) to a third game where almost all draws where land.  Just down right annoying.

That coupled with as soon as the packs that came with the precondtucted decks were open, the decks become unbalanced.

As I see it, there should be a second deck with just land that you can draw from and deck construction should be based on a point system like miniature games.

It is funny to click "Own" on MTG.  Magic is... it is like more of a lifestyle, financial investment, culture, social group... I am at a loss for words.  Sometimes I am in love with it, and sometimes I hate it.  Infinite design space and creativity is possible with this game.  It can be played myriad ways.  The art is the greatest and has kept me playing for over 20 years.  It surpasses the definition of gaming.

Pros: The game design is impressive. This fact cannot be denied. It is also relatively easy to play once the game structure is understood. There are turn structure cheat sheets on BBG which help beginners.
There is a great deal of cards. Again, that cannot be denied. Wizards of the coast releases a new set every 3 month. It adds an incredible replay value. Imagine your favorite board game getting an expansion every 3 months. Madness and fun.
Cons: The rarity system which changes the card dollar value. Some cards are worth $10-30 because they are rare. This is the basis of a collectible card game obviously, but it does hamper enjoyment for the casual player. There are some cards I would like to buy but won't because of their cost.
With that, comes the obvious level unfairness between players. Some players will have amazing expensive cards which there will be little you can do against. Great players can win even with a poor deck but for the rest of us, we get trounced in 3 turns. Not awesome.
Finally, the seriousness of the players. There are fun casual formats like cube or pauper, but very few players will play them. These format level the field by either allowing players to pick from the same deck of cards or by using only common cards. This means that the advantage the money spent on rare cards can afford, is not available to the player, and therefore, many players will not play casual formats. A shame since I feel the game itself is great.
A final note. The artwork is fantastic. No other game offer such a visual treat.
Edit: With the release of the Theros block, we now have solo decks available. This improves the game for casual gamers considerably.

I started playing Magic when Ice Age came out, stopped for a few years and continued with Weatherlight (or was it Stronghold?) all the way through to Urza`s Legacy, after which I decided I wouldn`t buy any more new cards. In retrospect my collection was tiny, comprising of about three-four hundred cards only, but I still got around to build decent decks through active trading.

In my opinion Magic always had good, logical mechanics (even with the timing problems, which we always managed to solve easily). I never took it too seriously playing laid back games with my regular opponents on a regular basis. We used to play differently themed decks, eg. goblins, soldiers, the undead, and when one became a nuisance we moved on to the next. The games were gentlemanly, there were no antes and one of my opponents, clearly better in Magic than I was, always used to scale down his decks to have a decent game. It was a nice fun game among other good games.

I never quite understood the mania around Magic, with entirely sane people shoveling huge portions of their financial resources into bits of coloured cardboard. Most of them ended up selling their entire collections and losing a lot of money in the process.

I stopped collecting Magic when it started to become a little dull, and the new cards seemed only to be redesigned versions of old ones. Apparently the game itself has not seen that much a fall in its popularity, judging by the rate they still churn out new expansions.

I still have my cards and pull them out once or twice a year when I want to relive some of the magic of old days. It's a good and well designed game.

I'm a bit hesitant to admit that I do own this game because I don't know if I think it's a good game or not. Gameplay is good. Card collecting is not. There is a tendency to become 'most expensive deck wins' and also there is a problem of simply getting addicted to trying new cards.

RATING: 6
Good game, but very expensive. My amount of playing fluctuates, usually spikes before big tournaments. I like especially Legacy and limited and loathe Standard. (29.3.16) 

Haven't played MTG in ages. I can appreciate the design but it's not without its flaws: mana screw & flood being the worst offenders. Also the cost to play more interesting formats (limited and legacy) is just really prohibitive. Also I don't like the new design philosophy where creatures get better and better and other spells weaker. Nowadays if I want to play a CCG I just play Hearthstone instead. (23.1.2017)

I've had a sinusoidal relationship with the game over the years. Sometimes I'm really into it. Sometimes I'm really not. Not keen on the money sink aspect. Drafting is fun, though again it can be $$$. Have a junk cube, which is cheep and fun, though these days I don't want to spend the cycles to tune it or make it as good as it can be.

There's just no game as deceptively easy to approach and still as deep and full of layers like a giant onion. Once you start counting the money you've put into it little by little, you'll also cry like you were peeling one... Even though I don't actively play this anymore, I still think that my full appreciation of all this game's everchanging facets would be better summed with '13' than with '10'.

Magic will always be a treasured part of adolescence and, therefore, my game collection.

Unfortunately, as much as I love Magic, the cost to maintain such a hobby will always elude me. With the yearly core sets and new blocks released in tight proximity, I could never really seem to keep up with the current MtG scene. In conjunction with the increasing price of boosters, I simply had to kick the habit of investing in Magic cards.

Luckily, this does not detract from the fun to be had with my brother as we play one another with our outdated, probably illegal Urza block decks against one another to this day!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Real good game, maybe one of the greatest of all time, at least as far as card games go.  Too bad there are $$$ problems (pay to play) and the player base of retarded 15 year olds.  Do you know how you confuse the average magic player?  You draw a triangle with a duck in the middle of it.  Seriously, he'll just stare at it trying to figure out what you just did.

If I had unlimited money, time, and opponents, it would likely be a 9 or 10.  As it is, with its limitations, its probably a 6 or 7...  the Xbox version ranks somewhere in the middle.  

Anyway, If the cost wasn't so high I could see myself getting back into this.  I like CCGs and this was/is one of the best.  The money-fication of the CCG world is one of the great tragedies of tabletop gaming, and MTG is the posterboy.

Update:  The xbox live arcade version somewhat captures the fun of this for only ten bucks.  All there in game tactics are there, you can tweak the decks a little bit (not completely but enough to be fun) and it scratches the magic itch.

Collectability ruined it for me.

Collection: My Cube

A well-crafted game. Nicely illustrated. Ridiculously expensive. Even to play casually with a group of friends and a bunch of random cards can get a bit pricey. This game avoids erratas and confusion much better than most CCG's especially given the sheer amount of cards in the system. The best things about this game are the ubiquitousness (making it easy to find events and opponents), generally easy to grasp rules, and the ease of deckbuilding. Unlike many other CCGs, it doesn't take a ton of cards to build a decent deck. With fewer than 1000 cards, you can easily build 8-10 fun and different decks. Probably the distinguishing characteristic is how few cards you get each turn. Hand management and resource management are paramount here. It is much more tense and unforgiving than some other CCGs are.

Over time, I have come to appreciate more and more how much this is not just a game, but a system. A relatively simple rule set creates so many different ways to play that there is something for everyone. I think this is by far the most well-designed and most-playtested game in modern times. It's a testament to what devoted gamers can do with a limitless budget and full team of creative people. So much focus is put into making this game be something for everyone, that it can hardly help but succeed. There is something here for you, and you do a disservice to yourself by not playing.

Interesting in that you can see the origins of most of the basic CCG mechanics, but more recent CCGs have added so many more interesting twists. If I'd played this when it first came out, I'd have probably given it a higher rating.

Money sink of epic proportions. Cards are updated on a frantic, senseless pace and most of the time are just slightly different from the edition before.

This is fantastic card game with a really nasty meta-game (that, in some ways, preys upon folks with OCD). As this has since inspired many variable power asymmetrical card games, it does deserve praise. However, the CCG format potentially makes this a game of chicken with respect to who's willing to spend more. That is not to say that what you spend is what you get as good deckbuilding can overcome some fiscal advantage. When deckbuilding skills are within the same realm though, it's a who spent the most wins. I think that the last thing this hobby needs is a "who drives the nicer car" mentality.

Have been playing since Alpha and still love the game. Greatest CCG ever created but unfortunately to expensive to continue.

WOTC should have developed the online Client professionally and then add a number to all new booster packs that will give you these cards online FREE and dont sell cards online. This way they would have the cards sold and offer players a great benefit to enjoy their game online and train for tournaments. It would probably increase sales and offer MTG players an amazing bonus.

Hell-bent Raider is still the best card ever.

First of all i hate collectible games. It somehow means to me like "Please spend, spend much more" and makes no sense at all. This game is just outdated and i feel like it is the biggest luckfest i have ever played. There isn't enough strategy no more path to win. You dealt some cards, you play them out and if you got a lucky hand you will win no matter what. I don't want to play it again even if im asked to i will skip it instead. One of the biggest downfall of my boardgaming career so far.

The game that got me thinking about hobby gaming.  I started playing when I was 16, made the Pro Tour in 2001 and 2002, then got tired of the constant collection rotation.  Still play drafts once in awhile but constructed is too much for me to keep up with.  

I didn't like the newest rule changes to combat and the stack.  I feel like there is less room to outplay people these days and the designers are gravitating more toward powerful creature cards with a cheap mana cost.  

Still like the game, but I'm not in love with it.  Richard Garfield's creation is a legendary thing in the gaming industry.

I played the hell out of this when it first came out. Then I noticed that with all the new cards coming out every other day, there were all sorts of rules arguments. Tempers would flare and cross words uttered.

I love the combos and the deck building aspect is fun if time consuming.  However, games are often one-sided, mana screwage is a big negative and it can get really expensive to keep up with every new expansions.

Here is why I'm done with Magic the Gathering and other games sharing similar gameplay mechanics. In my view, the game often boils down to the following sequence :
-Draw/Play card.
-Check how many defender you need to block the opponent's attack next turn.
-Attack with any left-over card if advisable.
-Realize you can't do much.
-Repeat ad nauseam until a player draw a card that can break the stalemate.

Also, those games have hundreds of different cards, each having their own unique effect.  Unless you invest a lot of time in playing the game, you spend a lot of time asking your opponent (or being asked) the stats/effect of each creature/hero being played.

Magic the Gathering. I played this game from the Legends set (where everyone was talking about the new "gold" cards) up until Shields of Alara (sp?). I even played some Commander past that, but eventually my group got too competitive at it and I stopped.

Gave away my thousands and thousands of cards just to not have to own them and possibly be asked to play.

At my "peak" of playing, I would still have only rated Magic a "7". I went to tournaments, spent many hours making decks and playing, but it was never really all that important to me as a game. Fun, but not great.

Nowadays the gameplay has become pretty unbearable, and I just prefer to not play anymore. I could probably be coerced into playing (thus the 4) but I'd really rather not.

One of the most disgusting money sucking games in existence. It is the definition of "Pay to Win". 
Whoever has spent more money on cards will win. Simple. The actual game play is also absurdly luck based, more so than other card games due to the fact that you need to draw cards which create mana to actually play other cards. Very bad.

I caught the tail end of the initial surge in popularity. Unfortunately, I was too late, in a matter like it is like collecting baseball cards. By the time I played it, my friends had amassed small libraries of these cards, and I wasn't about to spend money to catch up. This was a groundbreaking design. It was fun to construct your own deck, as much as it was about playing. In a matter of speaking, it scratches the same itch as the classic "Robot War" on the Apple II, and the TV show "Battle Bots". People love making/building/programming up stuff, and putting it to the test in a gladiator-style arena. Will my design survive? Will it win? It is the same with Magic. Can I "program" the ultimate deck? Thus, starts the addictive cycle of program/build, test/battle, debug/tweak, and retest/battle until you have the winning-est design/program/deck.

Unfortunately, the business model drives the game model, such that successively better, more powerful cards are constantly being introduced. It's great for the game company, but lousy for the gamer. My friends eventually caught onto this, and ditched their libraries for a small fortune. As a game played in isolation, it was wonderful. But when it became about who could buy/locate the next powerful card, and then sell it to the highest bidder, then it seemed like the original spirit of the game had been compromised. This is the same addiction cycle that I believe Dominion is trying to exploit. I sensed it, and stopped at Seaside.

This game seems like it is no longer something you can casually buy and play with a friend--I wish there was something very basic and self-contained (and thus my initial enthusiasm for Dominion), and there probably is something like it. It is more like a life-style, requiring lots of money and time to get good at. Like chess, I am not willing to make that investment.

[center][size=6][COLOR=#878787]LIFETIME GAME [microbadge=28495]:star:[microbadge=28496] "PLAY FOREVER"[/COLOR][/size][/center]

[i]The best hobby game ever made.  Period.[/i]

My favorite thing about [i]Magic[/i] is that it is a game with literally thousands of pieces, all capable of interacting with each other in amazing and surprising ways; this fact allows a player to truly "play their personality" like no other game does.  [i]Magic[/i] does an incredible job of evoking its theme—wizards duelling with magic spells—by having you first craft a library of spells (your deck) and then "remembering" them (drawing cards during a game).  There is a big HOWEVER, however:  the game is best when played in a controlled environment where all players have access to the same number of cards, e.g., limiting card purchases to a predetermined number of decks and boosters.  [i]Magic[/i] breaks down horribly when the arms race spirals out of control and then the rich kid wins.  The very assets that make the game like no other are also the problems that plague and break it...  And yet I've played it constantly since '94, and will continue to do so.

PS.  This is the only Collectible Card Game that actually makes sense as a CCG, that is, the mechanical act of drawing and playing cards is akin to flipping through the pages of a spellbook.

PPS.  The hands-down best way to play if you don't want to get into the collecting aspect is to buy a couple of pre-constructed decks.

I left it long ago. Too expensive for me. I have some ancient and nostalgic decks constructed.

UPDATE: Due to power creep, my nostalgic decks cannot stand a chance against modern cards. I sold my valuable cards and trashed the rest.

Magic: The Gathering is always fun, always evolving. It may cost you a pretty penny to keep involved, but it's always worth it. Plus, if you're interested in investing, some of these cards can make you some good coin.

In my humble opinion this game deserves the lowest ranking a game can get.  Don't get me wrong, at first it was a great game to play (and I guess many people see it like that and get hooked) but after a while I had to concede that it's one of the best set up money-making schemes this planet has seen, as ultimately the player with the bigger wallet wins.  My advice to anyone who considers trying it: DON'T TOUCH, it's truly best compared to what a drug addiction does to your bank account - suck it empty!

Widely played card game. Both simple for new players and complex enough for hard gamers. Infinite possibilities through the custom decks, which is the most interessant part of the game!

Pros: easy to begin, widely known, collection cards
Cons: expensive to follow each new card edition...

I used to play intensely and even compete. I still have hundreds of cards...stored in boxes. I still play sometimes with friends...

Despite the overabundance of cards and the deviously compulsive nature of collcting them, I still consider this one of the best game designs ever and have had many of my favorite moments in gaming with Magic: The Gathering.  I don't log plays of this anymore (especially with MTG:O), but I do play limited formats from time to time.  There was a time (about 8+ years) where this game would have been an "11" for me, but time has dimmed my interest.  I still have a great time when I can play the game and consider the design a genuine "10".

Beyond the cool artwork, I don't understand the obsession with this game. When you have game mechanics that can leave you in a helpless position with nothing to do (i.e. mana screw), that is bad game design. Insta-win and infinite-loop card combos are another aspect of bad design that killed my budding interest in this game. Then there's the whole CCG blind-buy thing...

This is the father of CCGs. It was fun back in the day, but has grown stale. It's too over-bloated with rules and the need to keep track of extra stats (e.g. +3/+5), token cards (that don't come with the card that creates them and therefore need to be sourced elsewhere), etc. that make it less enjoyable and more of a frustration. 

Forget introducing it to new players. I just want simple beginner decks like the ones that existed back when I started. They were a single colour and had simple rules.

I stopped collecting way back at the Exodus expansion. Unfortunately this means that I can't play anymore since I would now be playing against more overpowered fatties and dual lands than you can shake a stick at, but I'll still give it the high rating it deserves for being my middle school obsession and easily the best designed CCG ever. I would never turn down a game against an opponent with similarly powered cards, but I will also never spend another dime on this game. Its easy to see why LCGs and deckbuilders have caught on so well.

This was the game I was addicted to for a long time, my brothers starting during Unlimited and got me playing around Ice Age. Being a kid at the time I didn't have a lot of money to get new cards, even so I always loved it, this was my gateway game!

I really got into it around Kamigawa when I started spending lots of money and going to tournaments and such. My current group of Magic players is much more casual than my old tournament day friends but we still play Magic almost every time we get together. Nowadays I just buy cards for a deck idea I have and refine it, selling off cards I don't use. I sold my collection and only keep my decks.

For a casual game, it's alright. The main problem I have with it is that the person who spends the most money loading his deck with the 'rare' cards tends to win. It's a problem asscociated more with magic than a lot of other CCGs - eg Battletech or the more recent LOTR TCGs.

Most of my games have been played during drafts, which are fun, but I don't really like the game design very much. The resourcing mechanism is so archaic that I find it hard to believe so many people still play it. Often a game is decided before the first card is drawn, simply due to the way in which they've been shuffled. The Call of Cthulhu LCG's great resourcing mechanisms really make this seem outdated.

We play MtG at lunch time when running our school holiday program, Kraftworks for Kids. The program is for kids aged 9 - 14. The kids love this game. We have more than a dozen decks with each deck labelled according to its mana colours. The kids soon find a favourite deck. We pair up the beginners with one of the Leaders while those who have played a few games are able to play without assistance. While the game doesn't quite appeal to all kids (as Killer Bunnies does) those that like to play like it a lot. It is easy for adults to play with kids too.

[b]LEARNING THE GAME, GETTING THE CARDS, BUILDING YOUR DECKS; THAT’S THE EASY PART. WHAT’S REALLY HARD IS QUITTING THE GAME AND NOT RELAPSING[/b]

*Note: Unlike other reviews of mine, this one will focus on MTG as a financial and social phenomenon, and not much in the game itself.

I don’t think there is anyone on this planet who prides him or herself a gamer or geek and has not heard of Magic: The Gathering (“[i]MTG[/i]” from now on). It is not uncommon to find board gamers and other breed of geeks that have a shoe box (Or more than one) filled with these cards somewhere in their closets, cellars or attics. The same goes to role-players, of which some have told me that in the beginning there was some sort of competition between which game was better: MTG or RPGs. Irrelevant, they’re both interesting and fun. And that’s hardly the point of my review.

As the fore father of all contemporary trading, collectible or living card games (TCG, CCG and LCG, respectively), the brain child of Richard Garfield is maybe one of the most beloved games of all times, and it has been since its creation in 1993. Back then of course, rules were simple, card abilities were very few and most easily to understand and learn how to combine them and tournament rules and games were mere reunions between friends curious about who had the best deck, the best cards or just who the best player was. Nowadays, there are over 30 different abilities, more than 7 different “colors” or “factions” (If you will…) and over 30 different editions, each with their own rules, abilities, card types and whatnot. The game has definitely thrived, but because of this, it has also turned into some sort of addiction amongst the geek community world wide.

Amazingly enough, there are cards (Mere pieces of paper with a few words and a cool drawing on them) that are worth $500 (five hundred) dollars or more and certain cards depicting the artwork of specific artists (Rebecca Guay, Jesper Ejsing, John Howe, etc) are collector’s items. The whole MTG universe is just not for the game itself, but also for art dealers, finance aficionados and other people with particular interests. A person wanting to buy a deck or booster packs in these days must know that they’re actually investing in something bigger than the small pack of cards they’re paying for.

Now, let’s make a brief comparison between being a MTG player back in 1995 and being one in 2011: The former player is (most likely) just interested in playing a fun game with some friends and likes to collect cards, all beautifully designed and illustrated by some guys with serious talent for the arts; The latter is not only buying a product manufactured by one of the most rich multinational gaming companies of all time, but also, he or she is investing in the long or short term in items (I.e., cards) that could very well be worth separately twice the price paid for the deck or booster pack just bought. Maybe he’s not into playing the game, but only in accumulating paper wealth and art.

 Call me old-fashioned, but I don’t think I like being a (retired) MTG player in 2011. I think I would still love the game if it were 1995. But all in all, the game still rocks, it is still amazing and maybe, JUST MAYBE, it’s completely worth the money paid for those precious little pieces of hard paper. Also, maybe I’m just bluffing and I will eventually relapse into this immortal game/investment.

[b][i]II. Sliders[/i][/b]

Abstract [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Themed: Because of the incredible amount of editions in existence, it would be stupid to think the game needs no them to work. Most of the CCG obsessed gamers in the world will agree that theme is as vital (And sometimes more vital) as the mechanics and systems used by the game itself. Also, let’s not forget the infinite merchandise this game spawned, which is all about the adventures and themes within the Multiverse.
 
Simple [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Complex: Complexity in MTG is a very vague and abstract term. The deck building system each player in the world brings to the game table an endless array of possibilities and strategic ideas, but the complexity of the game itself, that is, how you play, how you put cards in play, how you pay for them, it’s as simple as tying your shoelaces. It is the player who decides how hard he will play or how intricate his strategy will work.

Strategic [b]__________[/b] Tactical: I believe it is unfair to firmly say that MTG is a purely strategic or tactical game, because players might decide to use their decks in such a way that strategies work depending on certain previous movements and decision, or maybe, players will decide if they want faster and more nimbler decks, filled with one-shots, each powerful enough to cause serious damage on the enemy’s game. 
 
Luck [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Skill: If we were to think of beginners and veteran players as the same breed, certainly the skill factor would come to be on top of the luck element, but sometimes your deck won’t be very well flushed or sometimes the one card you need is taking a bit too long to appear. I have seen amazingly built decks fall to its knees before simpler and much weaker decks, only because the weaker deck was faster and the player got lucky. However, as I said before, it is all up to the player’s deck building system.

Fiddly [b]______[COLOR=#FF0000][7][/COLOR]___[/b] Elegant: Because of the outrageous amount of news rules and abilities each edition block comes out with, the necessity for a player to know how things work is essential to the game. Sometimes you may not really know how a certain card works, but most likely than not, the guy next to you or the salesperson of the shop you bought the card at might know what it does. Of course, exceptions always exist, but a quick question to an experienced player is sometimes all you need.
 
Indirect interaction [b]_________[COLOR=#FF0000][10][/COLOR][/b] Direct interaction: I won’t even address this particular slider. It is an obvious 10-Direct Interaction kind of game. 

Cutthroat [b][COLOR=#FF0000][1][/COLOR]_________[/b] Friendly: Considering the fact that winning is only achieved once you kill your opponent or make him bleed his deck out, friendly playing is not really a good idea in this game.

Heavy use of language [b]____[COLOR=#FF0000][5][/COLOR]_____[/b] No language needed: Given the fact that the game is released monthly in over 13 languages, language plays a very important role, but it’s not like you won’t be able to play if you don’t know English or whatever language the card is written in.

I used to play back in the days of the 3rd/4th editions.  Fallen Empires, Homelands, and Ice Age were the expansions out in my day.  I have a few cards from the days before that (mostly The Dark) but nothing too noteworthy.  Out of any of the CCG games I've played, Magic still seems to be one of the best, even after this long. (Although, admittedly, I have not played a game in quite a few years now)  Expansions continue to be produced which is a plus.

Ok collectible game.  The game has some severe balance problems and most of the time the shuffle, the deck build, and the collection not the play predicts the winner.  The game is massively cost prohibitive.  Cube format though can be the most fun as the best part is drafting and deck building.

RATING: 5
The core of Magic is fine and I could see myself playing duel decks (two 60-card decks designed and developed specifically to be played against each other by two people) in the future. The problem is that the game is bloated after 20+ years of rules elaboration. It's lost all elegance and simplicity. I also object to the business model of booster draft and the constant rotation of expansions. I don't see why players stand for this exploitation.

My friends and I were hard-core into MTG for about three years (roughly: Fallen Empires through Visions).  The habit was too life-encompassing and we had to give it up and move on, and I didn't like the "card inflation" with each new expansion. Still, I think it's a great game, and I'd happily play again with some old cheap cards that don't have enough collector value to sell.

My experiance with magic isn't very large, as I've only played in a handfull of booster-draft tournaments. Still, I had a lot of fun. Not sure if it's worth the price one has to pay for the cards all the time. I'm the sort that would rather buy stand-alone games. I plan to one day make a "cube" of cheap cards to play with in casual draft format. I know a lot of former Magic players that got out because of the cost, so the idea of playing for free and still getting the full experiance might appeal to them (you still get "packs" of random cards, you still get to build decks, and you can still play in a "tournament"). Either way is worth it to an extent, as it is indeed a great game at it's core.

Juego clásico. Escenario de combate en marco fantástico. El sentido original de "deck building" se popularizó con Magic. Los jugadores forman el mazo antes de encontrarse para jugar, la construcción no es parte del juego como sería luego con Dominion y todos los que vinieron después. Para mí, la construcción del mazo durante el juego es mucho más estimulante. Sin embargo, Magic todavía rinde mucho y su mecánica de juego es rápida y ágil. En una serie de rounds de combate debes bajar la vida de tu oponente a zero antes de que él te lo haga a ti.

Got sucked back in again. Only two negatives. 1 the price. Seriously, $50 for 4 decks worth of cards for Edition 14. Second, rares reward the person who buys the most / best cards. It really is a genious game though and has maintained it's status as one of the best CCG's around but casual gamers::BEWARE.  You will lose most games against anyone that has spent $50 more than you.

Awesome gameplay. The only drawback is the cost / business model. However if you play casually you can get all the benefits for very cheap. Spend $20 on ~1000 common cards on Amazon, pick a few hundred of them to form a 'cube', then draft decks from this cube with your friends.

There is no game that has had as much an effect on me as Magic: The Gathering.

This is not an uncritical endorsement. There are many parts of MtG that are deeply flawed. Randomized packs. The predatory rotation cycle. Deep undercurrents of sexism in the community. All of these are very severe flaws that would damn another game for me.

That being the case, please understand that it is with an awareness of these flaws that I still rate MtG a ten.

I played since I was around 9 or 10 years old, starting out with my sister crushing me over and over with a faeries deck that I could not figure out how to beat. I played casually for years after that, before starting out a streak of competitive play around 2012/2013. This took off around 2014/2015, and it got to the point that on any given evening, I was more likely than not at a tournament of some sort.

My specialty was drafting, and I dare say I got to be a player that was (at least locally) considered pretty good. I could consistently 4-0 or 3-0 online pods and local tournaments.

Eventually, I realized I had to give it up. The time I was sinking in had led to me jumping significantly in skill, but the next step would have been committing whole hog. I'd have to drop other games, play competitively online, and likely get into a local testing group to really jump to the next level. I had a wife, friends who really didn't care about Magic, and a demanding job. I let the dream go, and gradually began spinning off my collection.

Magic taught me a lot in my time with it. I never thought that I could have gotten as far as I did, and it gave me a lot of confidence in my ability to learn and improve. The regimented method of always looking for holes in my game, and the ability to suppress my emotions to continue playing for my best shot to win has carried over into my life. I feel that I have become better at assessing my own performance, not just in games, but also in day to day life. I'm patient with my own mistakes (or at least, more than I used to be), and I am much better at hearing criticism than I used to be. All these things came from my time playing competitive Magic, along with countless other gifts and lessons I haven't listed here.

Magic is a deeply flawed game in many respects. There are countless barriers to entry, and there are very serious questions about the ethics of its business model. It is still impossible for me to not rank it a 10. If something that was so formative for me and that I played for so long through so much of my life isn't a ten, what is?

Edit:
After reconsidering, I'm going to drop this to a 6, which more accurately represents my willingness to play the game nowadays. I still deeply appreciate the joy and learning MtG brought me, but if I'm rating according to BGG's scale, I rarely want to play anymore.

Absolutely great game concept.

My rating reflects [u]casual[/u] play with a well-defined universe of cards.  And the majority of my casual play is multi-player, which helps mitigate those "deck selection failure" 2-player game experiences.

My belief is that if I actually ever played this for competitive purposes, all the fun (as well as a lot of cash) would evaporate immediately.

I began playing when this first came out.  For a couple years, this was the only game I played.

I have sold or given away all of my cards and since I was an early adopter and had a lot of really valuable cards, they paid for a very large chunk of other games I have purchased since then.  Lucky me :).

LOVE THIS GAME.
Ran into this game in summer of 2013. And I must say, I am so sad that I hadn't started playing sooner. I love the concept! From the land tapping, to the wicked combos and abilities, to that moment when your opponent brings out a huge creature... and you counter it with one card. *sigh* It's priceless.
Now I'm still new and I do have to ask some stupid sounding questions from time to time (at least, they sound stupid to me). But from my experience, the Magic community is just that: a community. They have been patient with my questions, my odd deck ideas, my witty humor.  
The only cons I have of this game... is the price. BUT, that isn't going to change. Black Lotus will always be the king of card prices (unless they decide to reprint... which would be hilarious and WRONG). But you don't have to dump a lot of money into the game to have fun. Either pick up a starter deck and some boosters ($20 + about $4 per booster), or go to a card shop and talk to the employees. I had them build me a deck that cost less that $15 (and it seems to be doing fairly well too).

Bottom line, if you like card games you have to try this. If you like fantasy, you have to try this. If you want to play a game with a huge community of players, you need to try this game. And if you are a geek... you must try this. Seriously, I think it's a requirement to being a geek.

This is a good, medium weight CCG. I am not "huge" into the theme, but the kids received it as a B-day gift so we have a few decks at home. They like it, and I don't mind it either; only, it can be expansive to try and "collect" better cards, so we just play with a few "store bought/starter decks" and we have a few booster decks to supplement them. I think the theme can be a little too dark or sensual then is necessarily, but not graphic enough to distract from the game play. Overall a great CCG, but not one my family invests in.

Its complex interactions, pre-game deck building and ever changing environment (not to mention great art) keeps me coming back year after year.  I discovered the game back when Alpha & Beta had just sold out.  I tend to get bored fairly quickly, this game made me a fan of CCG's despite there higher cost of entry.

It's crazy that a few weeks before I encountered MTG, a friend and I had come up with a concept of making a card game that would be based on the theme of two wizards dueling/fighting.  Cards would consist of spells and artifacts, so as soon as I read a small article about MTG, I had to check it out.

ahh...the great addiction.  What a game.  The smell of a freshly opened pack.  Those were the days.  

Seriously, this game rocked back in the day (before Ice Age).  Were it not for the comercialization of it, it would get a 10 from me.

The best way to play is with a giant 300+ card deck with as many people as you can.  A monster slugathon of epic proportions ensues that is loads of fun for all

Good game system, but not a game I enjoy near as much as many others.  Would take a huge time investment to become familiar enough with the game to enjoy it more.

Raised the rating after doing a booster draft with the current set (Return to Ravnica).  Had a good experience and would like to do more booster drafting.

Drafted Gatecrash at a Friday night magic in Alameda with Ashton, then went to the Dragon's Maze pre-release sealed event at Channel Fireball.  Enjoyed both.  Limited is definitely the way I'll enjoy this game.  Also holding on to cards to re-make budget packs, so the limited fun can continue at home.

I really enjoy limited Magic, but won't be playing it much since it requires going to a magic shop.  I just don't enjoy the vast majority of the people there.  I'll keep my eye out for chances to draft in other settings with friends.

I played this game *way* too much between 1994-99.  The collection aspect doesn't really appeal to me, although I really enjoy the game.  It was too expensive to keep up with the arms race that developed within our gaming group.  There were too many expansions; perhaps one expansion every six months would be better as it was too difficult to keep track of what the new cards did.  Now if they made a *non*-collectible version of MtG, that would rule!  (This game would get a 5/10 if I factored in the collectible aspect into my rating.)

RATING: 4
Magic: The Gathering is a decent and fast playing, hand management card game, but there are so many better card games out there (Race for the Galaxy and Yomi are two of my favorite). 

The main problem I have with M:tG is that given two decks there is very little replayability. The replayability is derived almost entirely from the novelty  of seeing what decks you can design and testing them against each other. The game requires a constant influx of new cards to keep it interesting.
That being said, I am fairly confident that a good game designer could design a couple of decks that would be interesting to play against each other 100s of times (WotC sells "Duel Decks" but they just aren't really very good). If this were to happen I would probably buy a set.

There is also a huge learning curve if you want to play the game correctly as many keywords and abilities do not work how you would expect. For example:
A creature can be indestructible; this means that the creature cannot take damage or be "destroyed" BUT if the creature has enough -1 counters placed on it to reduce it's toughness to 0 it can still die. 
The game is full of little things like this that make it very hard to learn.

As a casual game using similar and/or limited card pools this game is better than almost everything on the geek in my opinion, and I would rate it a solid 10.   It is a game of tactics (during play) and strategic imagination (deckbuilding).

However, played in the tournament environment it devolves into a game of who owns the best cards and plays the best net deck.  Played this way I give it a solid 4.  Since I have moved I have no casual players to play with so I am stuck with tournament play. (Ugggh)

RATING: 8
[b]Favorite game of 1993/all time[/b]

It requires strategy, tactics, and skill. All while simultaneously being a conflict, puzzle, and a race, and is successful in each of those aspects. The most innovative game of its era that spawned a bunch of mediocre knockoffs and inspired designers for generations to come. One of the few games that can also be an investment.

FFGs Living Card Game model fixes the uneven playing field inherent in a random distribution model and all but eliminates the secondary market, which is positive or negative depending on your perspective. I sold my collection, and all I got was a lousy nest egg and a downpayment on a house. 

The only way I play anymore is with proxied block decks and [url=http://www.cubetutor.com/draft/90166][b]My Cube [/b][/url], which I'm slowly de-powering in order to add one card from every regular set, and as many unique, playable keywords as possible. Sorry banding...

My rating is biased due to nostalgia, but despite the game's [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B._F._Skinner]Skinnerian[/url] distribution model, it is technically still a game, and if you rate it a 1, [url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXWhQ2cY5sE]we can't be friends.[/url]

Got piles of cards. Really a great easily approachable head to head duel with good tactical and some strategic play, luck is quite present as well though as in when the cards come to you. There is some strategy to be sure and more so if you set up your deck, knowing your opponents cards to set up against them helps here and we don't fuss too much with this as we have out set decks that we like. 

We usually play this as a late night filler and it is still quite fun to play after many years, however the collectibility aspect of it went way too far. Great replayability in this game with even 100 or 200 cards each, which would be cheap purchased the right way. I also have lots of Middle Earth cards as well and after reading the rules(haven't played yet) ME does look to be a better, more involved, more strategic but also far more complex game I'm looking forward to with a fantastic theme of course!

Moderately fun game but I always had bad luck with mana. The same deck would go mana starved one game and then flooded the next. It's a frustrating mechanic and honestly I think it hurts the game more than it lets it do interesting things. Maybe I need to learn to shuffle better. Plus the fact that constructed formats make the game a huge money sink. Even doing drafts isn't super cheap. And I don't find the fun added by doing a draft to make up for the loss of deck quality versus constructed. Though again that deck quality comes at the expense of affordability. Plus the fact that to do well you really need to know all the cards, which change out constantly, making this much more of a time sink than I'm interested in.

Magic is a great game, it's fun to play, but people need to realize it's not the only game out there. Too many people refuse to try anything else in gaming and dump way too much money into this game. It does constantly evolve which is nice but players need to stop worshiping this game only.

Great game, pretty easy to learn, fun to play with someone with the same level of experience. Plenty of strategy and easily found for sale at retail stores. However, there are TONS of cards, constant rule changes, and don't even attempt to collect them all, it would cost a small fortune(large fortune if you need more than one of some cards!) I stopped collecting because I was tired of being broke all the time.

Oh Magic, why must you be the source of the collectible game scourge?  You're not that bad of a game, really...some fun to be had throwing monsters back and forth and casting spells...but why oh why the collectibility?  Why oh why the eight million different rules, each with a card somewhere that breaks it?  Sigh...there needs to be a nice, self contained, NON-collectible spin-off of magic, one that has good cards and fun mechanics right out of the box.

I feel the game has gotten too complex for its own good.  Right now I am LOVING the downloadable Xbox 360 version of this game....$10 bucks for multiple decks with tons of cards, no expansions needed.  It's what I want from Magic.

I've only got maybe a couple hundred games of this in, mostly in the 1990s.  The downsides are obvious - it's SUPER expensive to be "good" at, and once you build your deck, the game basically plays itself. 

That said, the deckbuilding is superb.  Lots of choices, great balance between the playstyles, etc.  But it's the epitome of a CCG, for better and worse (mostly worse.)

Addicting, expensive, but wonderfully challenging and rewarding. Can play game after game after game, and it's never the same twice.

Edited to add: 7 years after I wrote the above I have a caveat. I play multiplayer almost exclusively. Duels in a particular format get repetitive as hell. Play anything-goes 60-card constructed multiplayer, and there is definitely nothing repetitive about it.

RATING: N/A
I played heavily from The Dark through Tempest.  I played "Type I" before that distinction existed, and mainly stuck to that format for the ~10 years that I played.  Super complicated rules (at the tournament level at least), and the collectible aspect should have been deterrents, but the game was absolutely fascinating to me.  I have since stopped playing, and have sold out of most of my old power / beta cards, however this game will always be important to me as it was ultimately my gateway into BGG-style gaming.

Were it not for M:TG, I wouldn't have been introduced to Settlers the night before Gen Con in 1996.  And really, I probably wouldn't have been there at all.  And true to its name, "The Gathering," I can trace almost every one of my current friends and gaming partners back to M:TG in one way or another.  It was the thing that initially brought us together in college and beyond.

I have a friend who is trying to pull me back in via the Elder Dragon Legend Highlander format.  Fun without worrying about keeping up with the tournament scene.

It's a classic, and to be honest, the only CCG I've ever played. I've never felt like spending the money to have the perfect deck. I'm perfectly happy with the 500 random cards I bought off of amazon. Sure it's all commons, but if both players draft out of the pile, then it's pretty balanced.

Great game.  Draft is about the only format I'll play these days.

Update (Summer 2012):  I'm ranking Magic based on my three different format experiences over the last couple of years:  Cube Draft (10), Commander (8) and Draft (8).  

Cube Draft has rekindled my love for Magic in a way I never thought possible.  I'm confident I'll be playing Cube draft for the rest of my gaming life.  It's that awesome.

I'll play this if my students really want to but I don't find the ingame decisions that interesting to me.  Most of the strategy comes in the deck building and I found that to be way to time consuming for me.  I ended up putting a few decks together and selling the rest of my cards off.

Limited play - tried to get into the game, but never really found a group and never really got into the gaming at my local stores.  Seemed like a neat idea (and I enjoyed a few of the old computer games out there based on this) but my interest fizzled at the 'collectible' aspect of the CCG. (i.e. I never generated enough interest to actively buy more cards and try to build a custom deck).

I was into this game for about 10 minutes in the mid '90s.  I used to collect baseball cards, so the collectible aspect appealed to me.  It can be a black hole for time and money, so I guess I was fortunate not to have a bunch of friends who were really into it.  Update: I finally managed to play it again in March 2012.  I played with decks others had built, which was fun, but it didn't create in me the enthusiasm for creating my own decks.  Update: I played in a draft tournament and won.  Go figure.

This, along with Settlers of Catan got me into board gaming. I have so many fond memories of various victories and defeats over the years.

At one time, I had a lot of fun with this game.  Plus, selling cards paid for a quarter of college.  These days I have a hard time stomaching anything collectable (the only one I can tolerate is Navia Drapt).  While I do get to play Magic a few times a year via friends who borrow me a deck, I can't see myself ever going back now that complete fantasy card games are so common.

RATING: 10
One of the best games, if not *the* best game I have ever played. The number of cards allows for extraordinary variety, gameplay is tense, exciting and shock full of gutwrenching decisions. Various deck styles allowing for aggresive, defensive play, decks bent on locking up the opponent&#039;s game or take him out with a well-thought-out combo all contribute to an incredible rich game. And the higher the level you play at, the better the game gets. Not for the faint of heart of course...

This little game from this little company sure did change everything.  
This is a wonderful game that I have been playing for over 10 years now. Many people hate the collectible aspect, but it certainly was innovative. Constant expansion and a beautifully designed game always keep things interesting.  The pro tour was a wonderful marketing plan that I think we will see copied more and more in the future.  Really the only negative thing I have to say is that there is a major time and money investment to stay competitive in this game (something that I am no longer able to do).

I would have rated this game a 10 fifteen years ago, but it has turned into a power struggle to by new overpowered cards.  I do love the concept and appreciate its ability to create a visual spatial relationship with just a set of cards (no board). Just a great idea and a really fun game.

Aggressive release schedule and marketing aside, you'll be hard-pressed to find many games with cards that weren't influenced by this in some way or another.  It was the first reason I ever stepped into a hobby shop some 20 years ago.

This game was one of the first games I ever played. I used to play it as long as 6 or 7 hours a day but since I played it so much I don’t like to play it so much nowadays. However the game is GREAT, it offers lots of fun and the play time is generally short.  On the downside this game is extremely expensive if you want to play it competitively. 

I have at least 10.000+ plays before 2010 thus I have not logged them. I played Magic casual and competitive for 13 years

RATING: 9
This is where the BGG rating system breaks down.  Is this a 3 because I'll never play it again?  Not at all.  It is both a moneymaking machine and a mechanical masterpiece, with more replayability than any other game I've played...by an order of magnitude.  I don't think it's an overstatement to say I've played 1000 times and still have the desire to trot out my crappy mono-Green Gorilla deck from time to time, the only deck I still own.

Two issues ultimately make this a 9 for me instead of a 10:  complexity and game balance/expense.  The complexity is at the heart of what makes Magic so great.  At the same time, having to learn new keyworded abilities, as well as keep current on rules revisions, makes playing a proper game of Magic a chore.  A rewarding chore, but still at times a chore.  The game balance issue is between players who invest different amounts of money in the game -- between players of equal or near-equal skill, the player who invests more has a decided edge.  The alternative is limited play, which can cost upwards of a hundred dollars a sitting for a group of eight players, and as much as I love the game that's ultimately an investment that precludes frequent play.  Even Civ + Advanced Civ at eBay prices beats this value after only two sittings.

This one taught me the meaning of addiction. The biggest problem, of course, is its tendency to favor people with money. The problem that bothers me the most (and the one that eventually led me to leave the game behind) is how later releases re-issued powerful cards from previous editions at a more common rate. It was frustrating to have spent a long time in the game only to play a new player with money who had new versions of cards that were, originally, very hard to get.

I'd not suggest this one to too many people (as it's really addictive) but I still participate with friends who haven't changed their decks (and don't collect anymore) in a few years.

Edit: rating reflects the current game and not, so much, the game I "retired from." I recently played a friend who still plays with a deck from 7 or 8 years ago. My great deck had turned into a mediocre deck because of the incredible cards that were FAR more common in his deck. He had cards that read like jokes we had made when I played.

An incredibly elegant framework that's open just enough to allow for seemingly endless combinations of mind-challenging card interplays.

Yes, it's collectible. I'm not sure why that's a problem, though. One of the definitions of "hobby" would be something that one is willing to spend money and time on. Typically a game group (of any type) tends to run at most 15 people. So why there can't be a LOT of fun had with MTG among those 4-15 people escapes me. I think people whine about expensive cards because they honestly expect to play at the Pro Tours.

The game grows and evolves and then goes back to revisit old themes and reprint some cards. There's nostalgia. There's excitement. There are tense, "who's going to win" situations. And a certain amount of luck always plays a part in the game. The best deck could lose to a craptastic deck once in a while based on card draws. That's all card games.

It's just a beautiful, beautiful game that won't be getting old during our lifetimes.

It might be the only game that I am ALWAYS willing to play. I definitely consider myself, first and foremost, a Eurogamer, but this game is just so elegant, you can't escape it's brilliance.

It's the best game in my collection... And I've got A LOT of games. I don't even want to start putting them all on BGG. I just keep my own spreadsheet. (And in the comments column, Magic is the only one that says "Best Game Ever."... I suppose it SHOULD be the only one that says that... that's what a superlative implies...)

You'll lose a LOT of games at first, but be patient. It is extremely worth the effort and bruises to break into understanding the possibilities.

Did I mention it's just a really darn good game?

RATING: 10
An enduring game.  I was told about this game in 1993 by a friend who told me that a new game came out that was good for two players.  I rushed out to find it and have been playing it ever since.  The game has infinite levels of complexity so ten year olds can play with each other and adults who have spent years playing can play each other.  However, the game does not do well when people of different skill levels play each other.  The more skilled player will win over and over again and one can devote years to becoming more skilled.

2013-02-19 - I dropped a ton of cash I really didn't have on Magic: The Gathering when I was younger.

M:tG is a great game provided you are aware, or blissfully ignorant, of the potential financial sink.

The deck-building is often the thing though and the obsessive compulsive consumerist drive is where the game lost some of its luster for me.

A classic!  I used to think about playing MtG all the time.  I loved that you could spend time making decks, reading articles on strategy, etc. . . and prepare for the times you'd get together with friends and play.  Ultimately I couldn't keep up with the pace of the meta and all the new cards, so this will continue to slip through no fault of its own.  In truth, early MtG was probably my favorite game ever.

Magic is a sprawling game, beautiful and flawed at the same time.  It's probably best thought of as a game system, as opposed to a single game.  While the game I've probably played the most in my life, it's not perfect.  However, it's easy to find a game if I want to play, and a number of innovations, such as the way it uses drafting, have made a big impact on game design.  I would say Magic is the most important and influential game of the past 20 years, and is up there with Dungeons and Dragons vying for most influential "designed" game (as opposed to "traditional") of all time.

Started the whole CCG genre and I was there from Alpha. It's best when played from a draft or sealed deck tourney. My most played game ever. The game provided me hours and hours of fun and for a while I was the Champion at local tournaments, this is why it's one of my all-time favorites and still gets played with pre-arranged decks. I sold my set of power cards for over $5,000 and paid for cards then and now. I also sold sets I collected for another $2,000. 

UPDATE 2011: was insulted for what I was offered at Origins so I got Dave and Ogden into playing again. We played for a solid year and now it's trailed off again after we all spent more money then intended.

UPDATE 2015: EVERYTHING is sold. Drove to Buffalo and put 5 G's in my pocket. This was the only game that paid me to play it.

The core game, with no expansions, probably rates a little higher.  But with all of the expansions, the game turns into a money pit... and quits being the fun filler it was originally meant to be.

One of the most popular collectible trading card games of all time. Love the simple mechanics which comes with new twists everytime a new expansion is launched. The artwork on cards are excellent and love the theme. The only consideration is the constant need to purchase new expansion for upgrading if players like new stuff and aiming for tournament.

Rightfully so, many people hate this game for Wizard treating customers like cows, milking cash out of them with every new set. 

But even so, the game is just too much fun...It is my longest played game, and have most memories with. I spent fortune on this game, and I had every ounce of fun with it. And if I ever decide to stop playing, I can always sell my cards to get back my $ so nothing much lost here.

Cube/cubelet is by far the most amazing way to play MTG (drafting skill, level playing field, different everytime, up to 8 players) and is not necessarily expensive AND is inclusive.

Takes up a LOT of time, you become a librarian - curating your own MTG collection!

This game is great, but there are 3 main things that can ruin it. 1 is the number of cards and the price... I can't stand having to buy and buy and buy to be satisfied, 2 is some playgroups and play styles really make the game un-enjoyable and 3 lands are outdated. newer games have much better systems in place.

The grand daddy of all the card collecting games in the world. Three to four sets popping out every year for 15+ years. More money made from this CCG then all the other CCGs combined.
The first game with card combos. A fantasy game with great art, and abilities are every card.
Take 60 cards, some with resources (22) and the rest with up to four copies of an individual card. Cards come in three types when I played: Common, Uncommon and Rare.
People would go out and buy the best of the best cards and play in tournaments.
Making up strange decks to play with leads to fun fun and disaster when against finely tuned decks.
This game will drain your wallet and bank account. Highly addictive. 
I switched over the online play and bought virtual cards. Seldom did I buy expensive cards, all I wanted was to make simple decks that were fun to play with. I no longer play with cards, just online about once a year, or I will get in trouble with the wife.

I really not too sure about this.  I like the *idea* of Magic - and appreciate what it brought to the market - but the few times I've played the game it's just fallen REALLY flat.

I'm really not a fan of the deck-building either (which probably means it's just not for me).

Magic is a classic, but the mechanics are starting to show their age.  A new breed of CCGs (Harry Potter, WoW, AGoT, just to name my favorites) take Magic's basic mechanics to the next level of refinement.

If Magic made one change I would play: any spell can be placed face down as a basic land, a la Duel Masters or WoW.  Until that happens, I have to ask myself why I hold on to my cards.

Just got.  Never played.  Don't know what I'm doing, but I do know I feel like a geek.

Played it four times tonight for the first time.  I can totally understand why people like this game so much.  I'm still learning the rules and I have no idea about strategy/deck building, but it's an enjoyable game.

Played it a few more times since ^.  There's sort of a boxing mentality and feel to it.  But rather than punches you throw and block elves and stuff.  And rather than getting physically beaten, you just suffer emotional anguish when a hot girl walks by, sees you playing MtG, and laughs.

Magic: The Gathering offers so much to love. The infinite possibilities of colors, strategies, card combos, etc. make for a uniquely enjoyable experience. Aside from the brilliance in the tactical subtleties in the timing and execution of attacks, when and how to defend, etc., where MTG truly shines is its customizable aspect. Deck construction itself is a rich, enjoyable process with layers of strategic decisions to be made. The possibilities are truly endless, and your imagination can be unleashed in the process of "creating" the game. Some critics of the game deride the mana shortage/flood issues that can occur, but astute deck construction minimizes this potential pitfall. It is also very easy to teach and introduce to new players. Magic is easily the most creative, original, and enjoyable contribution to the card game genre in the modern era.

RATING: 6
I used to play this game a lot when I were younger. In many ways it appealed to me ... appart from collecting the cards I liked to just sort them, construct decks and trade with my friends. I had fun scanning the pictures and manipulating them or find funny pictures which I glued on the cards ... people actually found some of them so funny they wanted to trade with me.

Now however I find that I havent' got either the time or the money for this game.

It has several "flaws" ... like the banned and restricted lists ... or the competitions where you need to have a lot of really expensive cards to make a difference ... or people getting hustled by their not so nice trading "buddies" ... or that it is so popular that people actually makes fake cards.

10.4.2015: 5 years later and I prefer Modern and Standard tournaments to casual games.

28.10.2009: I started playing in the autumn of '94 (between "The Dark" and "Fallen Empires"). Had a pause after "Urza's Destiny", but started playing again around "Mirrodin". I have way too many cards... :) An awesome game! I usually don't play in tournaments and if I do they're Sealed or Draft. I'm a casual gamer, since I don't have time to follow the tournament scene.

This was THE gateway game for us... then Carcassonne and Catan.

Addictive game.  (Yes, I'm ashamed to admit, that during a sudden moment of weakness, about 20 years ago, over the internet, I was perfectly willing to trade my very good conditioned, however, slightly used husband for a mint conditioned 'Icy Manipulator'... I just couldn't afford the postage on him (165 lbs) at the time and the deal eventually fell through after 4 days of humorous e-mails...)  

We still have our 25  'kick-ass' constructed theme decks in card sleeves, (and yes, I still have Bruce) and occasionally play a game with our sons who have both since gone through their own 'Magic' phases.  Still today our refrigerator is graced with homemade magnets from useless 'Atog' cards.  The collectability and constant rule revisions eventually lessened the appeal for us.  An exilerating ride while it lasted though.

With 20/20 hindsight... money well spent, IMO.

The original money pit! If at first opponents buying/trading for rare cards that you couldn't counter wasn't annoying enough, Wizards Of The Coast introduced a two wave/base set limit on tournaments that forced players to keep sinking money into their collection on a regular basis (with reprints dropping the value of cards dramatically).

PLUS: easy to learn, involves players
MINUS: large collection required
HUGE MINUS: tournament structure
MEGA-SUPER MINUS: money pit!!!!

A landmark game. Created a new style of game that has lasted and been re-created many times over. Elements of the CCG have crossed over to heavily influence traditional board games. Absolutely brilliant and original, one of the best game inventions of all time.

Regardless of whether or not you like collectible games, the mechanisms in this game are tops. People that talk about how they argue about game rules simply don't know the rules of this game. The rules exist, its not a mystery. If you don't want to look up rules, then at least don't complain about the game being unplayable because the player who spends most wins. The player who knows the rules and makes the best decisions wins. I have played in many high level tournaments and can assure you, winning is not based on money. I will admit that this game can be extremely expensive, but it doesn't have to be. This game also takes significant amounts of studying to master. I have played for over 10 years and understand the rules well, but new players may find them daunting. Overall the flavor, R&D, incredible freedom, and constant evolution of this game can not be beat.

While not reflected in my listed plays, I play this game quite a bit.  The game is made or broken based on who you are playing with and how they play the game.

My rating of 8 for MTG is based on my experience playing it in the first few years that it was available (93-95). I have not played it since then, but have fond memories of those times.

I like the strategy that the game has and the game mechanics that the rules provide.

When those get to me too much I disappear from playing.

Like all former D&D addicts from my high school years, I got into M:tG for a short stint in the mid 90's - good thing I was still a student, or I would have spent (wasted) even more money on it.  I still think the game mechanics are excellent (the system of "distributed rules" on the cards, and the theming of the 5 magic colours, and the deck-building "meta-game" were real innovations for such a mainstream game), but the collectable aspects make it less enjoyable.

Knizia's Blue Moon was a gallant attempt at toning down the less fun aspects of M:tG while keeping the essence, but still to find something that really brings it all together ...

I can only judge as a casual player who didn't really get into the game and didn't play it too much. I know there's probably much more to discover in it.

I don't believe a better game has ever been made. I say this fully believing that the 3-month tournament cycle was too fast for it's own good, and that the relentless forward march made for an unacceptable economic reality. 

The fact remains that I don't think a better game has ever been made.

I never did see the reason why so many people enjoy this game so much.  Sure, it's not a horrible game (in concept, in any case), but the idea of spending large amounts of money to improve your chances of winning a game just doesn't seem right to me.  Neither does the idea of having to buy two starter decks just to be able to play a "real" game...  I'm just not a big fan of CCGs ("Poke-Digi-Oh," as I like to collectively call them).  I'd just assume stick to the more traditional board games, thanks.

Lost in fire.

Plan to replace: I had spent hundreds, if not into the thousands of dollars on this game. To know that I lost my entire collection is a real reason for me to think that I'll never get back into this game. I may change my mind in the future, because I did/do love the game. As for now, however, I'm thinking that I will not get back into Magic.

RATING: 3
Former MTG player.  I got sick of constantly buying new cards and having games screwed up by poor mana distribution.  It's a bad game for everyone if one player has too much mana in their hand or not enough.  That problem alone became tiresome to me.  I know it's the most popular card game out there, but I've found other deck builders that I enjoy so much more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I play both online (on STEAM)and FTF (face to face), although my decks are nothing special.
MTG can be fun, but it can also be anti-fun when you run into neckbeards with stacked, overpowered decks that can't be effectively dueled unless you get lucky and have the particular kryptonite deck in hand.  
It can also be anti-fun when sheer (un)luck of the draw mean you get mana f'd.

RATING: 4
Fast to play, fun to create decks, but [b]too expensive.[/b] Typically, the person with the more expensive deck wins, a very lame aspect of CCGs. I'll play with friend's decks or on the computer, but I won't buy a card.

Also without mass inventory of cards, created decks get a bit stale. The best method of gameplay is sealed deck, but that's expensive. Too many ridiculous abilities since the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
One of the best card games I've played. The game's design is simple and elegant, completely diceless and resolved many problems that earlier card games had. Sadly, too many generations of new rules have destroyed this once beautiful game.

The deck-building aspect is brilliant because of the wide variety of cards and the different way they could be put together. I don't think any CCG comes close to blending simplicity with flexibility the way Magic has.

Rating just on game play/enjoyment: 6

Played two 3-player games with Archemeny rules.  Very chaotic seeming (I'm sure this gets better as you learn the cards and learn/build your deck) but fun.

Archemeny was brutal with only 2 players facing the archemeny.  It will be interesting to see how it goes against 3 others.

A couple more plays have lowered the rating for me.  Maybe it is that Archenemy isn't very good.  But it has happened too often that my hand gets reduced to 0-1 cards and then the games becomes completely devoid of choices and thus completely uninteresting to me.

I've played some games using the Commander decks, which I enjoy more than Archenemy. But at my level of play luck of the draw seems to be too big of a factor which is hurting my enjoyment of the game.

I only play it because a couple friends really like it.

I have played MTG for nearly 10 years. Once upon a time this rating would have been a 10+, however, lately the game has lost some of its magic (pardon the pun).

RATING: 8
Before M:tG I had been playing RPGs and some Games Workshop stuff, but this game made me a gamer in the summer of 1996. It is still the most addictive game I know and I've played thousands of matches between 1996 and 2003. At that point I had grown weary of the increasingly competitive nature of the community which wasn't that interested in casual play and toying with weird deck ideas. Also I didn't fancy the direction the game was going in. Originally players were the magicians, today they just play cards and there are these unneeded things called planeswalkers. Originally the art was interesting and varied, today it is just bland and generic fantasy art. M:tG has become become just seldom fun for me.

My all time favorite formats are T1, T1.5, Cube, Highlander and drafting from a commons box.

My all time favorite deck types to play have been WW, 5C No hand control (which was ruined somewhat by the removal of mana burn) that you could maybe call "Hellbent" with today's terms, G control with big hitters, G LD with lots of mana elves, U Snake Basket with varied artifact mana generation, Browse-Digger, RW Landkill, and 5C Counter madness utilizing Giant Fan.

Currently I have only a playable WW Highlander deck, ideas for new 5C Hellbent and various other cards from olden days.

Legendary CCG. I used to play it during my school years with friends. We never participated in any kind of tournaments and played from time-to-time. It was the time of Urza's Saga and Mercadian Masques sets. I stoped buying new cards and playing MTG around 2001. But I never tried to sell any of my cards and still like looking at 'em remembring the old times. =)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a brilliant game but its score is pulled down by the business model. Even if you have the money or skill to play it competitively it is just too time consuming for someone like me to keep up with card introduction and deck building, even if you only play limited formats. There are so many cards that if you don't play in tournaments (where judging the metagame is an important skill element) the winner will likely be determined by who has the right hoser cards to deal with the other player's specialized creation. Getting mana-screwed or land-flooded can be frustrating to some players although that was never a big issue for me. It is, however, a minor design flaw. If money and time were not an issue for me and I could play in tournaments frequently I would rate constructed Magic an 8 and limited Magic a 9.

I really do like Magic, and it gave me more pleasure and fun over the years that I played than any other game up to this point, but in the end, I can't support the scene and I do not have the money to keep up with the competitive levels. I've kept a few of my old (and VERY cheesy decks, i.e. Enchantress and something I cobbled together that I call "Chocolate Frosted Goblin Bombs," along with "Recurring Whale" and a Reins of Power-focused deck with shadow and flying/only block flying creatures + Goblin Bombardment and Propaganda, etc)

It is fun to talk about, it is fun to follow, but power creep and the sheer expense of sticking with it as a hobby are things that I can't really hold with.

Groundbreaking card game of magicking out dudes and flipping them turn-ways. Clever in several ways, though slightly wonky until the 6th Edition rules revision. Unfortunately, but perhaps unavoidably, the commercial context has undercut the game itself from the beginning. Still, it's very impressive.

From a design/play viewpoint, I dislike the fact that there exist more than ten thousand unique cards, many or most of which are messy, pointless, underpowered, overpowered etc., or have inelegant variations and permutations of block-specific abilities. If you could pick, say, the 1000-2000 "best" ones and play constructed with unlimited access to those, you would have a marvellous game. That's in part the theory behind cube drafting, I suppose.

I only own a few cards myself (received as gifts; the business model pretty much meant I would never get into buying cards), but have had a ton of fun playing with other people's cards, playing with proxies, playing and modding the Microprose computer game, and just checking out the new sets as they are released.

RATING: 1.5
Used to play this semi-professionally, put in many hours playing, deck building, traveling for DCI events and spent thousands of dollars on this game and then I burned out HARD (although a later audit of my winnings and the sale of my collection showed that I came out several thousand ahead, hooray!). Would be a 9.5  based on mechanics and did not have issues with collectability, printing, cost, greed and constant revision issues. Still willing to play with those 2-player battle decks, but not otherwise. 

For the people who keep randomly asking in PMs, -NO- I will not sell you my remaining collection, the last few cards I have either have sentimental value or are worth far more than you're willing to pay.

Update: I have been convinced to play the odd game of commander using someone else's deck and this format puts a great new spin on the game and I very much enjoy it. I am also glad to say that even being introduced to commander, I have no desire to start collecting again.

I know I'm committing sacrilege by typing this, but I dislike MTG. I picked it up in '95 and played for about four years until I moved to Iowa. I found a game shop that had tournaments and whatnot, but every single person there was a complete and utter tool. Many of them were playing the old "rogue rules" of when you lost a card, you LOST the card. I avoided places like that, but as money started to become tight, had to stop. I eventually sold off my collection, so don't ask me what cards I had.

I never got started again because I felt it would draw me back in again and I would be spending too much money.

Today, seeing people in game shops get so fraking anal about rules and the condition of cards just makes me weep.

If you enjoy it, fine. More power to you.

I will always remember my great experiences with this game. It changed my gaming culture, so to speak. It opened my eyes to the evolving gaming market.
There was NOTHING like opening up a pack of The Dark, and hoping to get the Maze of Ith!  lol!

Would rate higher if not for the monopoly Wizards puts on this genre.
Other fine games cannot survive because of the chokehold this company has on the market.
Also, tooo many expansions have kinda killed it for me.
I wont spend anymore money and Ill be just happy with the cards I have from 3rd edition to Planeshift or so...and tons of fond, fond memories of all the hours I have spent playing, building, discussing/debating and collecting this amazing all-time great!

****************update Jan 2012*******************

Well, some local friends have taken to this game and I have picked it back up.  Using some old decks (thanks to them for being considerate and understanding, hehe) and bought some new stuff even though I said I wouldn't anymore!
It's just such a great game...especially when there are other just as "into it" as you are!

I give this game such a high rating because I have been playing it for more than 20 years (started with Revised) and am still going.  I still find time monthly to meet up with the same people I originally started playing with and we play a few hands of Magic between board games.  It is basically our permanent go-to filler game.  The one big negative I see with it is the cost... especially if you are seeking some of the older, rarer cards.  Thankfully, I (and my group) started playing back in the dark ages, so I got those cards in packs and don't have to now mortgage my home to get them.  My investment in the game now is very mellow compared to what it once was.  I am honestly amazed how long this game has kept going for us.  The huge variety and the depth that this game can have keeps us coming back for more.  The game I have played more than any other... ever.  (Not counting D&D.)  ;-)

I just dislike the collectable/rarity aspect to the game and play Warhammer LCG instead.

If you feel the need to own all expansions for any game you own (like I do), DON'T GET INTO MAGIC.  This is an addictive game.  Don't get me wrong, I loved the way this game played, I've just found that it's an emotional, and money, pit in the long run.  I kept buying the cards, and buying the cards, and WOtC kept printing new ones (well duh, of course).  I also found that the competition was getting more stressful because of the nature of a majority of the people who play it.  I began to feel like I was among junkies looking for their next fix, whether to crush the competition with ultra-expensive decks, or to try to milk every last drop of a cards worth (or lack-of) in a trade, to justify the money spent on cards.  I hated the high emotions of the people I had to deal with who had so much "invested" in their habit and took it too personally.  The fun opponents I played with in the beginning became fewer and far between.  I was getting tired of the collecting grind, but I felt guilty giving up on my "investment" in cards.  Finally, my wife saved me by forcing me to sell the cards shortly after Ice Age(thank goodness).  And now I'm enjoying collecting complete-in-themselves games.  I feel much more satisfied with gaming now.  I look back at Magic now, and see all of the expansions, and still feel a little twinge of interest about it's evolution, but I also see how much money I would have wasted had I continued collecting.  In my opinion, there are many more satisfying games in this world.  Do yourself a favor, don't get addicted.

My relatively low rating is from disliking the game, rather than feeling it's a poor game.  Ie. I just don't like it enough to keep playing it.  I imagine many of my core c complaints lessen with more plays and more money as you create your own custom decks, I just don't have the time or money to invest in playing this enough to make it very interesting (or the desire to do so).  The random elements of the game leave me feeling frustrated, as I've seen roughly half the games I'm in either won or lost because people couldn't draw enough lands, or drew too many.  And the pervasive feeling that no matter what I play, there's always the chance that they'll have some card that counters it (with virtually no way to either know of its existence, or counter-counter it), leaves me wondering, "Why bother."  Ultimately, to scratch this itch, I'd rather be playing Blue Moon.

Update after 24 plays:  The collectable nature of the game has brought this down for me.  My son invested in some reasonably priced rare cards and tailored his deck to be very competitive.  I'll need to buy a few specific cards to keep up.

Update after 14 plays:  I'm hooked!  I have a fairly cheap deck, but by following some of the tips in the strategy forums here on the 'geek, I've been pretty competitive with my son so far.

Fun game!  Easy to learn and tremendous expansion possibilities.  My 12-year old son and his friends enjoy this game and he taught it to me.  I can see why this game has become a classic, and also why it can become a money pit if you get addicted!

I guess we own this one since we inherited a bunch of cards from a relative.  Although the game plays nicely enough, everytime I play it I feel like I am getting ripped off by a bunch of guys who want me to buy more and more of their cards so that I can win.

A great CCG, albeit one that costs an inordinate amount of money to play competitively at most Friday Night Magic events.  Add in the extremely quick pace for new set releases, the removal of certain core cards from standard play only to have the exact same card released with new art and a new name in a new set of cards, the frustration of randomized booster packs, and this is one of those games you love as much as you hate.  I thought the game was better before the Planeswalker card type was introduced, as games lasted longer and offered themselves up to more strategy, but it's still a great game.  The greatest CCG in my admittedly limited experience with the game-type.  Thank god there are limited environment console versions of the game now, so I can afford other things.

Wonderful.  Played 5 games for the first time tonight (04/01/07) and thoroughly enjoyed them.  I like the complexity and depth possible, combined with very simple gameplay which is easy to master.  Never would have thought I'd enjoy this sort of game, so I've surprised myself.

I got this game to play with my teenaged boys.  It's a good way to connect and hang with them.  Enough strategy to keep me occupied.  My biggest problem is that the game can very quickly get one sided, and that's less enjoyable.

Played very little a long time ago but never went crazy with buying boosters (just stuck with a starter set).  I really liked the mechanics but didn't like the "arms race" of the system.  Started playing again recently with my game group in a sealed format and I'm hooked!  I love trying to build a deck with the cards I have drawn.  Addicting!

Ah good old MTG. It was clever...then it was fun...then it was fascinating...then it was obsessive...and always was expensive....and now it has been put down (for good?). Kudos to Garfield for pure genius. Slops to WOTC for making a corporate franchise...complete with plan obsolescence. I guess just sticking to PreCon decks with friends is the way to have fun again.

Nagyon szeretem. Kamasz koromban inkább a HKK-t gyűjtöttem, mert az magyarul volt, de azért a Magic-et is megtanultuk a haverokkal. Én magam sohasem gyűjtöttem, mert nagyon drágának éreztem. Szerintem most is az, viszont most legalább vettem 2 dual decks-et egy kis páros játékhoz. :)

Great if you've lots of money to blow, are highly obsessive, and don't mind the sparsity of adult opponents.

It  remains my favorite memory of the game.

This is my desert island game.

Haven't played lately, but had much fun when I did in college. I love games where you have to deal what what's been dealt.  And deck creation...oh man, it's a mind game itself and (to me) as fun as the game itself (of course you need lots of cards).

Have to give it some credit for revolutionizing a whole industry.

I still have all my cards, and I did spend a lot of money, but I don't regret it. I know this is kind of sappy, but there's nothing but good memories for me (Joe, Blaire, Quan and other guys I only know by first name...thanks for the friendship).

Though I really only played during 1996-1997, I wouldn't turn down a game to this day.  I recently played in 2003, and I thought it was funny how everyone gawked at my old school cards.  I got comments like "I haven't seen that in a while."

Okay, I admit a few years back my rating was a 10. Rating sank for several reasons. First, they have made numerous rules changes that have annoyed me. Some are pointless reversals, and others just suck the fun out of it for me. With rules changes and many of the newer cards, you can have your cake and eat it too. I.E. Now you can block, tap to use your special power, and still do damage anyway. And the number of cards that you get back when they're destroyed, or are indestructable, or just plain reusable. It's like they've removed decision-making and resource management from gameplay. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

RATING: 7.2
I'm very rusty.  For years, I have not played very often.  But back in the day, hundreds/thousands of games!  All my cards are old.  When I do think about playing again, deck building is much tougher now - as I don't recall all the neat interlocking stuff like I used to.  Or I forget which set had the card that has a certain effect...

I own a lot of Betas, and have plenty of cards through Fallen Empires.  I also got a few cards through the Urza's Saga set, but after Fallen Empires I slowed down on collecting.  My collection is comprised of:  Alpha - very few.  Beta - lots of commons & uncommons, a few rares.  Arabiam Nights - Complete Set.  Legends - Missing several rares.  Dark - complete set.  Ice Age - might be missing some rares.  Fallen Empires - complete.  I've forgotten the name of the set with all the artifacts, but I think I have a complete set.  I always liked those Mishra lands that could attack.  All my cards are worn.  

I still think Interrupts make sense.  I'm an old player still willing to play, but I am resistant to buying new cards.

I'm also more interested in playing against other vintage decks.  I recently played against a new deck, and felt it had supercharged killing efficiency.  Perhaps the old cards just don't work against the new decks.

Other than Monopoly, this is the only game I have rage quit. I literally quit cold turkey and sold all my cards the next day.

1) To be competitive, you need to spend a lot of money.

2) The money you spent is worthless in two years, as the sets rotate out of modern format.

3) Playing against Blue/Black decks.

CCG. The original edition with its limited availability was the best version.  Everyone had different cards and you played with what you had.  No one owned multiples of every card.  The game was new, fresh, interesting and exciting.  Loved this game when it came out.  The game stopped being fun to play after Arabian Nights.  The Unlimited edition was a mistake.  Now it's all about the card combos.  The game is boring and predictable.  Also, I object to the business model of collectible games and I'm turned  off by the never ending stream of expansions and planned obsolescence of older cards.

UPDATE: While I still dislike the tournament scene and competitive Magic, in general, I do enjoy playing "Casual Magic".  MtG really is a very good game as its longevity in a very fickle market attests.

Although I've spent countless thousands on the game, I dont regret buying a single booster!

Magic: The Gathering spawned the genre of collectible card games and it is still arguably the best game of this type. It is certainly not for everyone considering its complexity and the addictive expandable nature that can make it a costly hobby unto itself. However, for those willing to put in a little time and coin it is a very rewarding game experience. It is a game of infinite variety with plenty of strategic & tactical elements both before the game (in deck selection/building) and during play.

Such a great game system... 

Mainly play with pre-constructed decks but also mix it up with a few other ideas.

The 'planechase' packs are VERY cool for some random, fun games

The 'archenemy' is another great option - nonsymmetrical games are always fun and this works very well (4 players seems to be the best spot)

Finally, the 'cube' style draft make for  very cool evening - it is certainly nice to build up a deck and then send it out to fight. Gives a good feeling of 'ownership' and making your own luck!

This is probably the best game ever. The rules are very interesting and were very innovative back then. Almost no limitation on how you build your deck- thousands of cards, tons of great artwork. 
When they changed the layout for the eighth edition I stopped buying new cards. My friends did the same. I think they've released so many new expansions since then that the game is great for new players anyway- but mixing the older cards with new ones seems terrible and I'll always hate the idea of changing game's layout for new expansions- it kills the game- make good layout from the beginning. The older layout was much better by the way. 

The thing that has killed the gathering spirit was the whole price list for cards- game had been much more magical before I got to know that list.
Now the best option is to try decks virtually and then buy specific cards. Cause when you want to trade cards with others it's like- yeah but this card is rare- gold- you see?

This is probably the best game ever. The rules are very interesting and were very innovative back then. Almost no limitation on how you build your deck- thousands of cards, tons of great artwork. 
When they changed the layout for the eighth edition I stopped buying new cards. My friends did the same. I think they've released so many new expansions since then that the game is great for new players anyway- but mixing the older cards with new ones seems terrible and I'll always hate the idea of changing game's layout for new expansions- it kills the game- make good layout from the beginning. The older layout was much better by the way. 

The thing that has killed the gathering spirit was the whole price list for cards- game had been much more magical before I got to know that list.
Now the best option is to try decks virtually and then buy specific cards. Cause when you want to trade cards with others it's like- yeah but this card is rare- gold- you see? So I want three uncommons for that. Wait but these uncommons are more expsensive that your rare- see?- so you give me two of these rare cards and I'll give you one uncommon... blablabla. It should be just "Money The Gathering" now.

I could pretty much play Magic all the time. I have around 50 decks (many that suck), so the game is always fresh. The best part of the game for me is actually building the deck. It's really a challange to build a combo deck that is original, something not seen in all the tournaments. But I pride myself on building decks that few play, and can still kick butt. The problem with Magic ... $$$$ ... it really starts adding up. I'm on a fast, and will probably be phasing it out a little from my gaming palate, but it will always be a fantastic game in my mind.

It's good. But it's collectible. For if it was not, I would be playing it still... On the other hand, without new cards coming out, it would be probably boring after a few plays... I know, that building a deck is a part of Magic strategy, but it should be more balanced from the start - according to new players, or to players that just want to play occasionally... The way this is now, I find it very unbalanced.

Just having some bad experiences with the game in the past...

Played once some days ago, it was fun after all.

Played the computer version - the collectable thing is just not important here. I love it :)

Back in the 90's (4th edition / Ice Age era) it was fun for a moment, but then I realized what a money drain it is if you want to keep up with the constantly changing tournament sanctions. The mechanics aren't bad, but the actually good cards and good combos vs. useless crap -ratio contributes only to the marketing scheme. Playing with just the basic summons etc. is pretty boring, so the highly collectible cards that twist the rules more are quite essential for bringing out the game. Hence M:TG doesn't interest me at all any longer.

A re-implementation of this as an affordable LCG could be worth a look with for example:
- reworkings of cards from Alpha to circa Ice Age with better balance, especially alternatives to the power nine or something like that
- all the completely useless cards removed

I have circa 140 cards worth trading left (mostly from the 4th ed. to Mirage), GM me for details.

An amazing game to get into. It carries a certain stigma with it (smelly bearded guys in the back of the shop kind of stigma), but it's very easy to learn and play. I learned via the Duel Decks Blessed vs. Cursed, and began to build my own decks after that. 

I think anyone who enjoys strategy with a hint of luck should at least play this game a few times. If you really like this game, you would love Phantom Dust. Look it up and thank me later.

The game was broken by greedy overexpansion, though some early cards were rather imbalanced as well.  Basic gameplay is nice enough, but winning now seems heavily tied to spending.  A lot of balance and enjoyment comes from a well-constructed deck, which takes time and experience to create (maybe money as well).

There has to be an evolution to the games for them to be enjoyable.  Repeatedly trouncing someone is no challenge, and repeatedly getting trounced is no fun.

Magic: The Gathering was the first collectible card game, launching a new genre of hobby games in which each card could change the game rules in some way. Players are wizards attempting to reduce their opponent's life total to zero (or run them out of cards) by casting spells and attacking them with various creatures. Cards can be lands, which usually generate mana of various colors, or spells, which require a certain amount of mana to be used.

Not interested in the sink hole that is CCG's, but enjoy the game. So I invested in the 2014 Commander Decks of each color. 

Own:

Commander 2014 Deck - Guided by Nature (Green) 
Commander 2014 Deck - Forged In Stone (White) 
Commander 2014 Deck - Sworn To Darkness (Purple) 
Commander 2014 Deck - Built From Scratch (RED)

The CCG standard bearer for years now. Magic: The Gathering allows for excellent games when played by well-matched players and decks. The expense required to play is a large drawback, and the preconstructed decks--although inexpensive--lack the flavor and ingenuity of personally designed decks. Deck construction/tuning can require a lot of time, but can be quite fun. The game's card drawing mechanic hurts the game when one player suffers from unlucky draws (by either drawing too many or too few "land" cards). This is a design flaw that had haunted the game since day one. Despite any drawbacks, however, this game should be played by all gamers at least dozen times to experience the grand-daddy of all CCGs. {6}

While M:TG started out as a wonderful creation, it has grown into a ravaging behemoth of a game.  I collected the cards from the late Beta release up until just before Ice Age came out, and I just finally stuck the 5,000+ cards I had into a suitcase and put it in the garage.  Not only did my interest in the game flag after playing it for a long period of time, but my interest in coming up with new and unusual decks seriously waned.  I've heard that the more recent addons are good and create a lot of game balance, but I honestly have no real interest in sinking another bucketload of money into a game which, apparently, will continue growing forever.  Perhaps it's time for them to stop adding on to the current game and start creating other sideline games that work off the same system, but have different themes.

The prolem with MTG is like monopoly. You cannot blame it too much because it was the first in the industry. Since it had to break the ice, it could not be perfect the first time. So MTG was good in 1995. Now, thechnology and design has evolved and wizards of the coast has even corrected their own bugs in their new card games (ex: Duel Masters corrected the land/mana bug and the lack of cards bugs ) but they never modified their MTG game to upgrade their game because of financial issues(too risky). Same thing as monopoly, you will never see monopoly 2 on the shelves of your store. So in both case, the company takes a conservative approach. Sorry but I will play a better evolved game.

---------------------------------------------

Another thing I have realized about magic is that it is the same thing as poker with a custom deck. The only strategy in this game is the deck building. Every thing else is the luck of the draw. Give different players the same hand of cards and they will almost play it the same way. So your card draw dictate your decisions.

In duel masters, it was different because each card had 2 functions. So the cards a player would be willing to sacrifice could be different from a player to another.

I came to this brillant card game very late.  I was in a non-gaming phase of my life when this was extremely popular and though I knew of the game at that time, I had never played it.  Recently, having enjoyed Blue Moon, I've been getting into some dead CCGs and decided that I should try the game that all else in the genre is measured against.  Having dipped my toes into the ocean, I can already sense that I could get into this in a big way if I had regular opponents etc. and my rating would almost certainly rise if I explored the game more fully.  Kudos to Garfield on such a groundbreaking design.

I really enjoyed this game when I first started playing it, but I started spending far too much money buying cards.  I still spend too much on games, but now I get more than one rather than just additional cards.  The only way I'll buy a collectable game is on clearance

RATING: 9
The experience of play, research, and deck-building merits a 10.  There's never been a more customizable or brilliantly malleable game.  The game's "fatal flaw" -- its collectability and high cost -- is also the reason that WotC put out so many thousands of cards and kept the game alive with innovative ideas.  

I'll never buy a Magic card again, but it is now possible to play the game with full artwork and with every card at MTGPlay.com.  The evenings I've spent with that program this year alone convinced me that M:TG is one of the all-time great games.

If Magic weren't a CCG, and were instead released in complete, affordable sets for each expansion, it'd be my vote for Best Game Ever.

As a wargamer, I have a love-hate relationship with Magic.  I love it can be played out in as short as 15 minutes or over 30.  Thus I play it daily (via online). It is a flexible game and in theory you have as many different games as you can if you can make up decks with all the different cards in five colors, with all kinds of possible combinations.  You aim to decrease your opponent life from 20 down to 0, the first one doing so wins the game.  Simple victory condition......  I hate it because it is still, bascially, a money game.  He who has the money has the power to build an invincible army or magic play.  Thus, different types of tournaments rules are set up to ban certain too "powerful" cards, an indication that the game has inherent "holes" that the game system can't contain people using cards that can sure win a game, if not totally in an abusive way. Play balance is therefore an issue in this game.  Besides, the rules for Magic the Gathering has been, at best, un-ambiguous for the first time reading.  You almost question everytime how to play new cards with vague description of special abilities, the timing of playing them, the "right way" of playing them etc.  Nonetheless, the PC online game version can serve as an instant referee to the above questions.  It also lets you to play faster and learn the game much more easily.  It is an open gaming system, combining creativity, logic, mathematics and all that. As a game, it is not bad.  As a meaningful of any sort, better look elsewhere.

Based on Garruk vs Liliana, and Jace vs Chandra.

Lots of small rule points ("Madness"), that are not answered in the Basic Rulebook.
The Comprehensive Rules are a great reference that quite clearly describes the rules, and answered many of my questions.  But they're dry.

Mostly tactical, without much strategy, at least in the first few introductory games.  Feels like Blue Moon on this account, until now.

However, the flavor/theme, and the variety of abilities makes it a much more interesting game, for me (until I realize that Blue Moon is actually much more strategic and difficult than I think—I should try the Blue Moon AI…).

The game is full of theme: it is easy to imagine the players casting spells, and the creatures fighting with them or each other.  The various abilities and spells are quite easy to imagine graphically.  The whole game could be made into a movie that would related the whole fight (ala Yu-Gi-Oh).

Plus, their is a large panel of available abilities and effects.  This even makes this game much richer in flavor than a game like Space Hulk, which drips with theme.

Having too little or too much mana is not so uncommon, even with pre-constructed decks such as the Duel Decks.  It can really make you feel helpless (I never feel that way in other card games such as Race for the Galaxy, Jambo, or even Blue Moon).  This is mitigated by the fact that limiting the damage requires some clever play, which can be challenging, and also by the fact that games do not last long: it's easy to play another game if the previous one was unsatisfactory.  However, some games are so dependent on luck that it's important to be ready to not be frustrated, and to play an additional game to balance luck out.

More generally: limited possibilities: few cards from your hand can really be played: choices are quite limited.  Only slightly more complex than Dominion, in term of choice.  Much easier than Race for the Galaxy; easier than Jambo.

However, the number of relatively original tactical possibilities during a single game is very good.  Reminds me of Court of the Medici, with more flavor and richness.  Race for the Galaxy offers more choices, but they are more strategic, less opportunistic.

No setup time!  Better than Race or Jambo (small setup time).

The Cube.  I love building a deck.  I get the same feelings as when setting up troops in CoH:AtB (Conflict of Heroes), or Lotr:TMG (minis): you invent strategies, think about what your opponent might do, try to get ready for all the likely possibilities, etc.  A lot of delightful thinking goes into this phase, and I love it.

Love most of the artwork.

The cards have enough character by themselves that what they depict acquires some kind of reality; cards can be recognized, which can bring nice memories ("this Incinerate saved my life, the other day").

Simply the best CCG around.  Huge variety of cards to choose from to play with.  Overall good balance to card power in most recent sets.

Main downside is the cost for best cards, in relation to that, competitive decks for some formats.

Forget the people who whine about collectible card games and money pits and so on. The game itself is a lot of fun, with tons of strategy. You spend as much as you want on it.

Pound for pound, dollar for dollar, I've probably had more fun with this than with any other game I've ever played.

played since '94, with only a few breaks in between​. Loved it, but lately I have been playing more modern cardgames, that use the LCG model as opposed to the "spend a million damn dollars to even be competitive, then 6 months later have to buy completly new cards to even keep playing in tournaments"
I will keep and playing with my cards, buy I will be damned if I spend another dime on this money hog. This diatribe does not even touch on the whole weakness inherent in the system, mana, what an archaic pain in the crapper. Don't even get me started on power creep!
I love you Netrunner!

Childhood game. the first game where my mind was open into the imagination of a fantasy world.
But a day, when I ''grew up'' and I realized that was a silly game with a lot of silly cards, and some interesting cards.

A great game, I think of it as the perfect game for me, it fullfills all my strategic, theme, interaction, tactical, cravings. The collectible thing made it mostly unplayable for me, I was a tournament player (in the way of getting succesful...), then I realized the game just doesn't worth all my time and money. It [b]IS[/b] a great game, I played it everytime I could... I hardly missed any serious tournament until it became evident that the game is all about buying more and more cards. My favorite season was Extended.

I've started to play Casual games with my friends. If a different rating appears here (other than 7) it's because of the causal games, not the tournament "serious" game...

EDIT: I really got into the whole EDH/Commander thing since I am a really vintage MTG gamer. I LOVE to play more Casual games now, I play Cube Draft, Normal non-competitive draft and a LOT of 4 player Commander.

So I go into the store the other day to see if they have any new Monopoly editions, and I see this Magic game. I buy it because I love magic. I open the deck and find what? A bunch of FANTASY stuff. No Houdini, no Blackstone, no Copperfield. Next I find that I have to find someone else that has a deck of this crap to play against? No thanks. If I am going to spend ten bucks on a deck of cards I expect a full game. I predict an early death for this loser.

I should really like this game, but something seems missing. The problem for me is that that dueling is secondary to the real "game" -- deck-building. The dueling part is dictated by the cards in your deck and the luck of the draw. I see very little skill here. Instead the skill is in designing the deck to minimize the luck of the draw and to maximize damage to your opponent. Unfortunately I would rather spend my time playing (dueling) instead of preparing to play (deck-building).

I have just made my first few steps into this incredible world (circa Ravinca - arguably a very good time to enter) and have been amazed by the depth and richness of this game.  So used to the closed worlds of the majority of boardgames this has been a revelation to me and inspired a part of my imagination that has remained latent for several years.  I know I will only ever scratch the surface of the game because of its long history, the number of card combinations and my limited budget but I will be happy exploring due to the mechanics of the game, the quality of artwork, the imagination, clarity of ideas and resources available online.  (I will do my best to stick to the pre-constructed decks but it is hard work when the cards in my local shop are crying out to me).

This was once cardboard crack for me, but eventually fell out of it. Standard is hit or miss, my favorite modern decks aren't always relevant, and I simply don't have the time to dive deep into it like I used to.

Also, the game design just feels old. Lands are a bad mechanic, and when you're playing for prize it feels bad to lose to an unbeatable draw or lose because you had to mulligan multiple times. I feel like the cards are fun, but the core game is aging. 

But without Magic I would probably not have been exposed to the wonderful world of modern board games.

Play MTGO (Magic the Gathering Online) or Duel of the Planeswalkers. You'll get more play for your money, less intimidated by the gameplay. Buying physical cards is expensive, and if you don't have a regular play group, stores or pre-releases can get intimidating.

RATING: 7
I really don't know where to rate this on the BGG scale.  I was a Magic fiend for a few years, but opportunities to play and disenchantment with the endless money sink led me to stop.  On the other hand, I don't have a serious issue with the game itself.  I could probably be persuaded to play under the right circumstances, but I'm not sure that the equivalent rating is really fair to the quality of the game.  What to do, what to do.

UPDATE: finally decided to rate a 7, since I would happily play some casually if asked, but I am unlikely to suggest it. It's a great game, especially when you consider that it created the niche, and predates the german boardgame invasion. The learning curve to get back into it seriously is absurd, though.

I cannot say anything bad about this game. Even though I really don't like the CCG aspect anymore, I still think it is a good game. 
It was my first real designer game I got into and I still like to get out my cards from time to time. 
But even if I still like it and think that it deserves the status it has, if someone would ask me whether to get into it, I would suggest Android: Netrunner to him as the better alternative.

I know a lot of games were inspired by this, but I feel like this game is dated. For example, compare to WoW TCG, a rather faithful predecessor. WoW TCG allows you to attack other player's creatures rather than just directly at the opponent, has heroes with different abilities rather than just generic health, and completely removes the chance of getting land-locked by letting you play any card as a "land".

Comments entered on 10 Dec 2009.

I started playing Magic: The Gathering in 1999. Since that time I have acquired at least one of every theme deck from every release. I have also acquired almost every special release of casual preconstructed decks (including Battle Royale, Beatdown, and the various "versus" decks). For about six years from 2000-2005, I played in competitive tournaments and also became a judge in 2005.

I thoroughly enjoy Magic because the almost unlimited variability in decks. The game has some very basic rules that are fairly easy to grasp and teach. The massive amount of rules and keywords over the years, however make the game become one of the most complicated to play. The complication is derived from all the multitudes of card interactions and not necessarily from a complicated rules set.

I guess I should specify that I really mean the Limited format of Magic when I say that Magic the Gathering is my 52nd favorite game. I never really got into constructed decks back when I played regularly, and drafting was always my favorite way to play. I liked cracking packs and finding ultra rares and building an entire strategy around them. I liked finding a way to fit things together that people wouldn't expect or be able to counter. I particularly loved Conspiracy and entire block built around the drafting mechanism.

when I say owned, I mean I have one introductory 2 player deck.  But I have played with some other cards over the years.

To be honest this game just doesn't grab me, gameplay seems a little forced to me.  I realise part of the gameplay would be building a deck, but that's not something I really want to get into.

All of my opinions are coloured by the fact I don't want to be caught up in the addiction of this game and spend all my money on it :)

Cool game but please dont get confused. It has nothing to do with skills. You just cast the cards in the order they are drawn, and considering 99% of decklists are just copypasted...

[size=18][b]Best of 1993[/b][/size]

My opinions of this game have gone up and down throughout the years.  Currently, I think it's more up than down. The multitude of formats allow a surprising variety of both gameplay and strategy for what is basically a simple rule set errata-ed by each individual card.  EDH alone I think revitalized the very possibilities of the game.

Favorite block: Innistrad
Favorite color: Black


EDH Decks:

Thassa, God of the Sea -- Blue Control / Combo
Raksha Golden Cub -- White Cat Tribal / Equipment
Karrthus, Tyrant of Jund -- Black/Green/Red Dragon Tribal
Ob Nixilis, the Fallen -- Black Landfall Midrange

Cubes for drafting:

Innistrad 4/2/1/1 set
Rise of the Eldrazi 4/2/1/1 set

RATING: 8
High-Quality entertainment back in the early days of Magic:TG.  Every time a new expansion came out, something new was introduced to the game, usually for the good.  At least, for a few years.

After a while, the older magic cards went out of date and became useless compared to newer, more powerful, and less differentiated cards that were guaranteed to kick your rear.  Tournaments went from being fun honest contests to sales pitches.  The game was already a huge money-sink without making unique cards that you had to buy to remain competitive.

Type: 2 player competitive card-based game (I only have some pre-set decks and do not participate in the CCG portion of this game.)

Best with: 2
Weight: Medium/Heavy
Duration: 15-45 minutes
Notes:
extensive card-reading
head-to-head competitive
strategy gets better with card familiarity after 4-5 games with a deck
my decks may not be balanced, and is not quite the same sort of game as the full CCG customized decks

My collection only includes a few prescribed decks bought as head-to-head packs, and does not include the option to cutomize those decks.

Similar games in my collection: Android: Netrunner (competitive deck customization), Star Wars LCG (competitive deck customization), Blue Moon Legends (competitive deck customization)

Before playing any Euros, my wife and I picked up some 7th edition starter packs in 2003 and learned to play.  Since that time, I've played quite a few Euro-style 2 player games.  I've recently begun playing again and taught it to a coworker.  Without a doubt MTG holds up to any of the other 2 player card games I've played.  Magic has it all:  tactical play, take that! style plays, slowly building up a power base, agony over losing a creature that you'd become attached to, surprise finishes.  

Don't listen to the bitching and bellyaching about the collectability.  Grab some cheap core set cards or starter packs, share them with your favorite gaming partner, draft a couple of decks and have fun. You can play this game at any level you wish.  For a little bit of money, you get a LOT of replayability and a LOT of bang for your gaming buck.

The only reason to rate this game  highly is if your name is Richard Garfield. Everyone else should rate it a 1 and ask themselves "What happened to all my friends, time and money since I started playing Magic?" 

MAGIC IS NOT A GAME!!! It is a brilliant marketing strategy. It is atrocious from a gameplayer's point of view. Your 'skill' in this 'game' is too heavily dependent on how much money you have spent. Want to play better? Drop another couple of hundred bucks. You'll beat all your friends until they go out and waste money, too.

I understand that it kept many game stores from going under. I understand that it exposed new people to gaming in general. I don't care. It's terrible what people do to themselves and the people around them whem all they care about is Magic. Allusions to this being crack in game form are completely valid.

With a risk of being killed by a mob of fans, I must say that Magic the Gathering is a game that is just too old, waaay past it's time...

How do you rate a game as established and varied as Magic: The Gathering? How do you give one score to a game that with formats like Planechase, Commander, Archenemy, the list goes on. 
It's just too expensive. You can't just pick up an intro pack and have fun. Even if you and a friend just buy and intro pack and play each other, eventually one of you wil get a booster pack and star tweaking the decks. Yes, I know this is the point of a collectible game. It's just not for me.

My chief disappointment was that someone could reliably beat me because he had spent more money buying stronger cards.

Solid rules that have been revised over and over, with all ambiguity hammered out. Game length is variable, from 5 minutes to 30min depending on your (and the opponent's) playstyle. Major flaw is that your opponent's wealth and tendency to buy cards (either single, or lots of boosters) will also determine to some extension his strenght. Friends and/or sealed deck games are your best bet (and also the most fun).

This is an old game but it is one of the best card games out there.  There is a reason that it sells as well as it does.  I suspect that the only game that ever has sold as well is Monopoly.  I have played this with my daughter since she was 9.  We don't play it nearly enough.  It is a medium weight card game with some fiddly rules, but the basic mechanics are great.  You play with your pre-made or drafted deck by putting out lands, summoning monsters, using sorceries and instants to defeat the other planes walker. First player to defeat the opponent by knocking out his or her 20 life wins.

If you haven't heard of Magic the Gathering I'd be surprised.
Its a great game and with a few House rules can be one of the best games around.
The problem with MTG - New cards are released periodically which are usually more powerful in some way.
The tournament play also only accepts the current cards and forces you to purchase new cards if your wish to continue playing in the tournaments. Casual play suffers no such restrictions.

Oh, other big problem... Mana. your power/resources are dependent upon card drawing, and if you don't draw the required Land cards... you can become "Mana Screwed" and often will lose as a result.

Of course the awesome game play and card interactions are second to none, the amazing complexity that deters many newcomers is what truly keeps bringing back the hardcore fans. When the Rule book is written like a several hundred page legal document you know the game is complex.
I go off magic for awhile but I always come back more passionate than ever after realising just how wonderful this game truly is.

This is a great game. The rules over the years started from messed up to eventually become very defined and are now pretty solid. The pace is fine, the strategy and depth is enticing and the overall game is pretty fun. There are two flaws though, one is that players who spend more money will always pwn you and the other is certain cards allow for nightmarish combos. If you can avoid those experiences this is a good game though beware of tournaments are they will change you when you realize the whole new level of the game.

I initially avoided this when beta was selling retail because I was put off by the marketing scheme.  Then I received a deck or two (beta) for free to try out.  Immediately was bitten by the MtG bug and liked this game a lot for the first few years.  Played in quite a few tournaments and leagues.  The trading and comraderie was fun.  It peaked for me during the Tempest/Visions/Weatherlight series and I stopped playing pretty much after the Urza's set.  Still would play sealed environment, but never really got into constructed decks too much.  This is difficult for me to rate as it was clearly a '9' or '10' when I was playing tournaments, but now might be a '4', since I'm unlikely to play again, except upon rare occasion.

An indepth fantasy CCG which has improved and will even get better with new block releases. I really do enjoy the flexibility and fun that this game produces. Multiplayer and two-headed giant are great variations on this 'king' of CCGs.

RATING: 6
My first introduction to a physical game deeper than Risk.  Absolutely adored the theme (yes, I read some of the earlier books), the simple mechanics, and the combo-licious gameplay.  The game has changed so much from those early days, though, and I have not been able to get back into it.  I suppose I just have too many memories of the earlier, simpler sets and cards.  FFG's LCGs, Summoner Wars, and Mage Wars provide the same type of mental stimulation without the massive spending requirements and the feelings of lost nostalgia.

Would happily play (with my old cards and ruleset) again.  Not likely to pick up in any form in the future.

Early 90s we did this lots; lots of money; lots of decks.  We had great fun too.  But it all got too expensive, too many expansions, started to pall and we started playing board games instead.  
Now the son has hit 10 and started playing, so suddenly we're buying decks again... I can feel it all happening again!   Great game, undeniably.  Especially big green creature decks.   

This time we're going to be rational...

I was late to the party, playing this for the first time in the Summer of 2013.  At least now I can afford it (as opposed to when I was in university and all my friends were playing it).  I enjoy drafting and playing from drafts, but not so much the dedicated deck-building/tweaking aspect of the game so I will probably never get into it obsessively (he says).

I played magic over a thousand games in a 2 year time and spend over a thousand euros. Fun game but very expensive and addictive in the beginning. When you're new to magic you will probably trade some real good rares with commands. I loved this game but it's getting expensive and it just dont interest me anymore. All my cards are now locked up in my closet.

RATING: 7
Rating is for a draft tournament (or similar egalitarian style of play). I would not play this if it required me to spend loads of cash buying rare cards to be competetive.

Magic continues to be the only truly worthwhile CCG, although playing it in the collectable format can be hazardous to your wallet. On the other hand, playing some form of draft variant where all players have equal chance to build a deck can make for a great evening of entertainment.

Card art is one of the strong points of M:tG, as is the ability of the game to constantly re-invent itself with new mechanics. A word of warning though: if playing a draft, stick to a core set (with possible a single booster cycle), and read up on the rules. Too many different mechanics could see this game quickly deteriorate into madness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I admit that I was a Magic addict at some point in live. But well it has all to please: Infinite number of combinations and good possibilities for strategical planning in deck building. Relatively short games with lots of tension and sudden reversals. I preferred the various multiplayer variants, since in those "cardmonger"-decks have less impact. I still play occasionally, but I haven't been following the sets anymore.

[Played more than 100 times]

So many options (...its best feature!).

It may be played at various "levels" (casual play, local tourneaments, big tourneaments, etc.).

Fast paced (usually).

It has A LOT of rules, so it's atrocious to introduce to new players.

Due to its nature, the quality of the sets may vary wildly (some years it's a great game, some others it really isn't).

I strongly dislike the marketing policy of WotC to get always more money from it, but the game itself is a good.

I am one of the many who spent SOOOOOOO much money on this game, trying to build the "perfect" deck. And even with 3 "Lotus" in my possession (anyone wanna buy 'em?)I can't come back to it (Mostly because I've spent the past five years MAKING games and toys for a living). While I played though, it was brilliant fun! And some of the art on the cards is/was hauntingly amazing!

At heart, this is a great game. Unfortunately, it was wrecked by years and years of bad designed cards (caused by an excessive quantity of expansions). Nonetheless, I enjoy playing it in "limited" formats nowadays.

Lack (or excess) of mana can ruin any game, though. This would probably not happen if this game was from 2003 instead of 1993...

The high rating is for innovation... Business innovation. We played this a bit when it first came out and while it is an intriguing idea, I don't think a situation in which the person who spent the most money will probably win is really a game. We got out early on and traded our valuable cards for Illuminati CCG BOXES. I'm glad the CCG idea has mostly gone the way of the dinosaur. I applaud Dominion and FFG's LCGs for interesting and approachable takes on "deck-building".

Preferred the original concept of always playing for a random ante card so that everyone's personal deck was constantly changing.  Game ruined by collectors and aggressive tournament style players.

I first started playing Magic in 1996 and at one point I was beyond obsessed with it. But after all these years of playing I realized something:

1. It's really expensive.
2. It's very time consuming.
3. I'm just not that good at it (typically last in tournaments and drafts).

My Magic days are over, but if asked to I'm usually up for a game as long as I'm provided with a deck.

This is the classic customizable card game. I do not play it the "normal" way. I don't have time to build decks so instead I have every Pre-Constructed deck ever made by the makers of the game.

Not trying this game would be doing yourself a great disservice.

RATING: 7
Although the basic game has not aged well compared with newer CCGs (e.g. Call of Cthulhu with its elegant solution to the no/only lands conundrum), the creativity packed into new cards keeps it interesting.

Casual play works best with the preconstructed decks, I found, and if you want to avoid the higher levels of rule interpretation, stick to decks from a single block.

Played 50+ times.

How do I hate thee?  Let me count the ways.  I thought I had rid my game room of this nightmare, but then discovered a dust-covered box way back on a shelf.  Just the sight of those cards brought back bad memories and all the reasons my group quit playing it.  Tell you more?  Sure!  Every game became an argument when people interpreted cards differently.  Or how about, "My instant interrupts the instant you played on my interrupt that interrupted your interrupt on my instant."  AAAARGH!  Now add in the "too much way too fast" syndrome that only power buyers and little rich snots could keep up with, and you know why I utterly despise this game.  I only rated it as high as I did because it got me back into gaming back in the Alpha days.  Those cards I found?  I'm gonna burn 'em.  Then I'll sprinkle the ashes with holy water, dig a deep hole, pour gasoline on them and try to burn them some more.  Then I'll fill in the hole and tap dance on it.  Maybe that'll make me feel better about all those wasted hours I spent playing it.

This game really had me for a while (back in the good old days ['94-'95]), but the collectable aspect and the money aspect started wear on me.  I got burned out shortly after that.

Good fun. I bought some theme decks a couple of years ago to allow the focus to be on the game rather than the collection.  With occasional lapses into compulsive buying (fewer and fewer as time goes by) that is where the focus remains.

Magic the Gathering can be played in many different ways; casual, tournament, commander, cube etc. 
My rating pertains to the Cube format specifically as I dislike the idea of tournament play where you have to 
constantly buy new cards for the current format and in a year those cards are no longer legal.
I also don't like the booster pack marketing model in any game. 

Cube however, is amazing. It scratches so many itches for me all in one experience. 
1.Drafting a deck 
2.Building, maintaining and updating the card pool from which those decks are drafted.
3.Creating the best deck with the cards you drafted. 
4.Dueling an opponent who has done the same as you and seeing how your two decks
 line up against each other in a highly strategic and deep game of Magic.

This is hardly a board game but I justify it because it's a contained experience I choose to pull
off my shelf and put back just like any board game. 
It's not comparable to most peoples list because it's such a niche experience that takes a large
time and money investment. 
However, if you enjoy playing Magic, drafting and deck construction but don't want to worry about 
buying packs or cards becoming irrelevant, this is an awesome way to play.

I haven't played so much in the last 5 years, but for a very long time this was the only thing I wanted to play. Unquestionably, one of the all-time greatest game designs ever.

After spending the past decade steeped in great board games, MTG holds up surprisingly well as a 1v1 game.  There are very few other games that play in 20 minutes, but still have this much depth.

Really quite fun, always avoided this game in the past. But bought the Garruk vs. Liliana dual decks pack for 20 euro (which seem to be fairly well balanced), and getting into this is fairly cheap. Not going to do tournaments lol, only play against wife/son. I can see this getting more play time.

There are two interesting aspects of this game: playing the game itself and building a deck.

When playing, there are lots of tactical and strategical choices to be made. Can I attack? How will I block an attack efficiently? Shall I play this 'instant' now? Shall I bring this creature on, or maybe wait until my opponent lost his fire potential? Shall I take damage or prevent it for now?

Deckbuilding is the other virtue of this game. After all these years, I can still enjoy spending many hours building a well-balanced deck and then see it perform against a number of others that are built according to the same set of rules.

This game, or actually the game scene, has its downside too. Some people spend way too much money on it. And new editions keep spilling into the market. I've stopped buying years ago. (edit: I've started buying again...)

Still, this game is outstanding. I always want to play and I expect this will never change...

One of the great CCGs, on that briefly held my attention for a period of time around 1994 or 1995 (Legends was just selling out when I got in, I think, loved the Dark expansion, quite sometime after Forgotten Realms).  Probably taught me more about economics than two first year courses in the subject would years later.   Really, the best CCG I played, with interesting deck building potential, etc, but one that I never had the time/money/drive to keep playing as I was about 13 or so at the time.  There was no chemical or activity that I have experienced that is quite like the rush of buying boosters.  Maybe that's how bigtime gamblers feel, I'm really not sure, but it does remind me of that scene on the Psychiatrist's couch in Owning Mahoney.

My Magic-playing days are over, but from 94-96 it was my hobby as much as Euro-style boardgaming is today. It doesn't have to be a money game, even if playing in some small, local store tournaments. And in any case, it rewards thoughtful deck construction, and sharp, tactical play.

Deck construction is a fabulous idea, and allows a wide and deep variety of strategies to come into play. Plus, deep tactical decisions make it a great base. The big minus is the explosion of cards and the collectable aspect making $ spent on cards = game advantage which just plain sucks. Play in a league where you limit card access, and you've got a simply knock-out game.

RATING: 4
Let's be honest: This game is only popular because it was the first CCG and it relied on predatory business practices with continuous expansions.

It is understandable why this game worked in 1993.  Besides being the first game of its type, the mechanics of the game were far more interesting and playtested than many other of the tabletop games out there released during that erra.

However, nearly 25 years later, I can say that this game is simply not that good compared to what's out there.

Resources to summon your creatures or cast spells require luck of the draw, which is an already a red flag for a poorly designed game.  Games like WoW CCG or Hearthstone fixed this problem.

In regards to balance, because Magic the Gathering is reliant on expansions that continue on forever, expect some cards to be either outdated and outclassed due to constant power creeps.  Some cards are simply inferior to others.  This especially true for land cards, with some of them allowing two different colors instead of one.  It's a pay 2 win scheme with some of the worst tournament payouts compared to eSports games.

Magic the Gathering is an interesting relic but it is not a good game.  Many games like Netrunner, Hearthstone, and Codex have been proven to work on the foundations of Magic and improved on it greatly with far less expenses involved.

RATING: 9
The greatest card game there is.  But bloody expensive to keep up to date with and that proves to be it's greatest weakness; the sheer amount of card releases means players never really explore the depth of the game cards before a new set are out.  Best way to play this would be to buy the main expansion on the year you start and never buy any other cards.  Ever!

RATING: 10
Been playing since 1983 -- Alpha release. Probably still my favorite game. But I have to say that I do not care very much for the full-bore "constructed" environments. I much prefer the limited environments. My friends and I play with randomly selected PreCon decks (the theme decks from WotC - over 60 different decks to date). This is an excellent way to play. Also enjoy playing in tightly constrained environments (example: 2 starters, 2 boosters from each of the 3 expansions of that block). Awesome game!

RATING: 5
I rate CCGs and their expandable cousins (LCGs, etc.) on this basis: "I will likely never invest in one again, but assuming that someone else hands me a deck here's what I think of the game."

I stopped playing M:TG years ago; if I still played, it'd likely be a 9. It's a beautiful thing from a design standpoint, and I absolutely loved deck construction and the tension of competitive play (especially in a tournament environment), but the expansion grind and the time and money commitment involved to stay competitive was just insane.

I still remember individual turns from tournament games I played back in the late '90s -- especially the ones where I had a really good deck, understood the metagame of the moment, and could play like hell. If I had a zillion dollars, could count on a local community of competitive players, and had the time to keep up with the game, I'd start playing Magic again in a heartbeat.

That's not going to happen, so sadly this remains a 5. If you handed me a deck, I'd consider playing.

Great game.  But, it is a huge time sucker and so has taken a back seat to the euros.  Though, we do play drafts and what not especially alot in the first half of 2007.  Mostly Solomon and Rochester draft using a set of around 450 cards (random subset for each draft).  Not a perfect 10, but will play it for decades - the definition of a classic in my book.

Currently (spring09) have two draft sets A and B.  about 5000 or so cards split into better and lesser stuff.  That has grown to 4 sets of about 9000 different cards here in 2012.  I built these as I purged the vast majority of the money from my stuff - I love a hobby that pays for itself, and then some.

When I finally began playing I realized that the game has actually rather deep strategies.

This game doesn't have to be expensive or too serious.

One of the best designed games I've ever played. Although now I don't play often anymore, its a game that has impacted almost every genre of games. It's a CCG where you bring a custom built deck to compete head to head. You draw resources to buy cards in hand, such as creatures, magical items, and spells to use to defeat your opponent.

Played it since I was 12. I've made tons of friends on this game, so it means a lot to me. You can always find people who play it. The game might seem intimidating at first, but with the right introduction (a good friend or Duels of the Planeswalkers) you get into it right away. The game is all about the community, so if you find the right play group, you will get sucked right in. I'm a casual player myself, so I try and make the community as accessible as possible where I live. And it doesn't have to be expensive. I only spend roughly 100$ on it annually.

I'm opposed to the idea of pay-to-win games. It's a major balance issue, and just not a lot of fun (for instance, my wins and losses feel far less related to skill than budget; this is worse than winning by luck).

Great game when drafting or using modified theme decks. There are an enormous number of possible interactions, and the game is very adaptable in both playing time and playing style, so I tend to think of it as more of a toolbox than as one single game.

4 / 5 - Great.

Fun game, hateful economics. I really can't seperate them. However, the best way to play MtG is to do so without spending a ton of money. Luckily there's lots of ways to do this: play with like minded people, simulate a "sealed deck" environment with a stack of cards, proxy expensive cards. The tournament-style game is worthless IMO, how can it be right when your ability to compete is based more on your wallet than your skill? The more I've played this over the years the more I've come to realise that creative strategy, such as it is, is all about deck building and little to do with play - I'm not sure I like that.

This is one of the best games created. The strategy of the gameplay is simple enough for beginners to understand but yet complex enough that you will never feel as though you have mastered the game.  To add to it, there are many different viable strategies in the game and the ability for a player to construct his or her own deck before playing only adds to the distinctive individual flavor that every game has.

Cost of entry is a little high for this game but is definitely worth it for any aspiring gamer.

FUN: this is the game that led me into gaming. I love the worldbuilding and diversity this game offers and it still keeps me interested due to its ever-changing nature.

UNIQUE: this is the granddaddy of all CCG's and it's still going strong. 

NEGATIVES: the game is showing its age a little bit in the extremely large ruleset and the restrictive resource mechanics. The random contents if boosterpacks makes this game expensive if you are a collector like me.

Played 15-20 times.

The kids wanted to learn this so I pulled it out again. Man, this game can be really complicated even in casual play. I am often a little uncertain about the rules for some particular effect or mechanism, and the attacking and blocking can feel like an odds-based wargame with take-that cards added - not something I enjoy. Will play again if the kids ask for it, but among CCG:s I´d much rather play Harry Potter, Mythos, Eagles: Waterloo or On the Edge.

For those who like the deckbuilding aspect and have money to spare, MtG is the king of this genre.

Obviously a well known game.  Though I don't play it as much as I did back in the day, this will always be THE card game for me.  The sky is the limit for complexity and strategy depending on deck construction and opponents.

Overall a fantastic game though.

Very beautiful card design. The game is a little too luck based for me, I feel like no matter how much I put into designing a deck luck prevails. Same goes for how enjoyable a game can be, there is a reasonable amount of randomness when it comes to the balance of each game and the eventual victor.

I was hooked in high school. As I think everyone knows, this is a money-eater, but everything depends on how you play it. 
For a while I played with my friends with 4 Shivan's Dragons, 1 Icy-Manipulator and various other "high quality" stuff color-copied and pasted on basic lands. On the other hand I also spend more money than I should have (as a 15 yrs old) on some original duplicators and Ball Lightening.

Generally, I don't tag games I've played previously as 'Want to Play', even if that's the case, but here the deal is that I don't ever intend to buy any MTG cards, yet I'd still be happy to play it casually.
I think Epic Card Game took all the best things from Magic (aside from full on deck construction with infinite possibilities), and improved on them, but I still glance at MTG cards from time to time, and if I find enough cards that I wish had equivalencies in Epic, I might build a cube or something.

This is my favourite Trading Card Game.  Trading, Deck-Building, Opening Packs, Drafting, Cube, Multiplayer, Flavour-text...  I love all aspects, except for the time consuming nature, and having to know so many cards!  Understanding the rules in a deep enough fashion to give you an advantage is also time consuming, and requires a lot of play with experienced players.  It is a game I've been able to pick up and teach people, the basics, and then they continue to learn themselves.  I started a small club of about 30 people in highschool, 2 of members went Pro!  Lots of great memories with this.  The artwork is terrific, and the game balance shifts with every release, always keeping people on their toes.

Have been playing MTG from 1995 to this day.

Can't even estimate how many hours has been spent playing this game.

It is the ultimate 'take with you anywhere and play' kind of game. 

MTG really has unlimited amount of variation going for it, thousands and thousands of unique cards, many different variants to try when you want to change the format a little. 

It is the best game i have ever played.

A mind blowing game and my favorite card game for 10+ years (since Odyssey). Its epic flavor, amazing artworks, remarkable graphic aspect and hundreds of cool thematic rules are some reasons why MTG was almost the perfect game for me and remains a very powerful trademark with a huge world gaming organization. Sadly to be an active and competitive magic player is quite expensive and requires commitment, so I decided to sell my remaining cards.

Used to love MTG but the rules just get more confusing with time. The concept of every card breaking the rules worked well for a few years but now it's just a convoluted mess. 

I refuse to play games that always result in rules arguments... There are just too many games that do this same thing cleaner and better now!

I've been playing MTG since 1997. It was an awesome awesome game. Very challenging and rewarding, very well balanced and addictive. Too bad on the past few years wizards transformed it into a money sink devoted machine. I went from a Hardcore well rated tournament player to a casual one, thanks to this. It can still be very entertaining on a casual environment though.

Intro to competitive gaming as well as many aspects of gaming total.  When focusing on limited play, becomes much more of a board game than anything.  Will play with anyone, teaching others who want to learn.  Will not force anyone to try (which I will do with other games I know they will enjoy).

Unbelievable money went into this game... and let's not forget about the time I have spent... ummm... ???

Honestly, I think I am addicted to the smell of the cards... they must use some sort of top secret ink which subconciously permeates my brain and forces me to stay addicted.

In terms of raw hours contemplating and playing games this is the second one I have spent the most time on.  The only thing that has held my interest for longer has been D&D/WFRP.  Warhammer Fantasy Battle would be third.

I recently started playing with my ten year old.  After twenty years, the thrill of opening a new deck is still there for me.
 
And if you have never tried this gem go down to your local hobby store and find someone to teach you.  The game itself is an absolute masterpiece.  Without a doubt it is my favorite of all time.

Notable cards which were in my collection: Ancestral Recall, Mox Pearl, Mox Emerald, Mox Sapphire, Time Walk, Time Twister, Time Vault, 4 Mana Drains, Library of Alexandria, 6 Force of Wills, Mishra's Workshop, Tabernacle at Pendrall Vale... 

But now it is just nostalgia mostly.

I really love this game.  I really do.  But knowing myself, I would not be happy with only sub par decks.  So I only play with a friend who has a ton of cards.  I also fancy some home made decks with he online database of all the cards.  That alone can be fun.

With that said, I find the unending expansion a bit silly.  But if the game works..why not...

Used to play Magic a few years back, and have some cards. Should be from the Unlimited Edition, Revised Edition, 4th Edition, Artifacts, The Dark, Legends, Fallen Empires, Ice Age and Mirage. Probably should have some extra cards from other sets-promotionals.

Was a good idea for about 1 month and the for the first set, but quickly fell into a mess of card and set releases that were to fix problems more than enhance games, and just to bilk gamers out of as much money as possible. Any game system that you have to dump insane amounts of money into just to become a BETTER PLAYER at - it deserves the French Revolution itself released on its ass. A money making scam on thousands of gullible people, many of which wake up one morning realizing what a massive hole they&#039;ve dug themselves into for nothing and end up resenting the game (thankfully of which I am NOT one). I&#039;d have a lot more respect for the game itself if it were all equal and attainable for everyone, but this deserves none of it.

If only money and distance were not a concern. Probably the best game ever made and fully deserves a 10. I have played this more than every other game I have played combined, by total time played, and games played.  However, those I used to play with are in other states and while I could find new groups the other thing stopping me is the amount of money it takes to keep current with the game.
Every gamer owes a debt of gratitude to Magic as it is the life blood of 99% of gaming stores today thanks to Amazon. Without Magic most FLGS would be no more.
This doesn't get a 10 for me anymore as I don't have the desire to spend so much on one game. I also like the board gaming community a lot better than the Magic community.  For me Magic was a great game for me in my teens and I will always remember it fondly.

This game is among the hardest to rate. I loved Magic as a kid, until I grew up and realized it was a contest of corporate consumerism. Now I hate it and resent the people who support it. Ugh.

Magic sold based on a bait-and-switch scheme: a $500+ per year game dressed up as an $11 game. Moreover, Wizards of the Coast clearly cares more about making money than about running a decent game, which breeds disrespect so deep that cheating is rampant in the tournament scene. Garfield made a great game, but Wizards f*cked it up.

RATING: 6
This is a bit hard to comment on. For me, it has been a very important game, it was "The" game for so many years growing up - culminating with me qualifying and playing (and losing badly) in the Nationals in 2011.

But after that well... I've played a bit with my friends, who never really tried to keep up with the pro scene or draft, but who just played "kitchen table" magic and had a blast with that. Also, I force my Commander (EDH) decks on them occasionally and that's sort of fun. However, I find that I'd rather play other games, for every occassion. I'm too far removed from kitchen table magic, I spent to much time reading strategy articles, watching videos, keeping up with every new set and discussion. It was a hobby all of its own and now I don't bother with it but I can't really go back to a "lower" level either - so it's stuck, and that's ok.

As a game, it's cool, a bit unwieldy in the rules department, a nightmare to teach and even moreso to play well. If you're thinking about trying it out, I'm not sure I'd recommend it, I feel it's a game that just "happens" and if it doesn't then you probably aren't a good fit for it. I doubt that makes sense to people but that's my take on it.

A good game!

Magic: The Gathering was my gateway to the world of board games. I loved MtG and played it all the time, but quit when I discovered Dominion and other modern European board games. After getting into board games, I couldn't justify spending so much time, money, and energy on constructing MtG decks. However, after purchasing some duel decks to play with casually, I've gotten back into it in its casual format. I like casual. It's fun. It reminded me that Magic is good. :) Who knows!? Maybe I'll even start constructing decks again? :P

Was great in the early days when the card supply was small.  It was more fun when you just start out learning the game and really are playing with random decks.  The fun disappears for me when one uses highly tuned decks, and its really silly now with restrictions on tournament card content, or super expensive card.. but thats the business.  I prefer to play with my old sets with old friends - random deck style.  I did enjoy making a really cool case to keep my cards in, back in the day; a spellbook.

I have played a lot of different games, but my favorite always comes back to Magic.  The only reason I don't give it 10 is because it's a CCG and the cost is pretty crazy.  But this is the most fun I ever have playing games, simple games like Dominion can't even compare to how complex a game of Magic can be.  Once you start adding in casual variants like Pauper, EDH, playing multiplayer games, it just gets bigger and bigger.  If I ever had to choose just one table top game I could play for the rest of my life Magic would be the easy choice.

I love this game actually. I've played it more on-line than in person, but am constantly impressed by how games play out. I've had duels that I thought about for days afterwards, exciting back and forth matches that came down to skill and some good guesswork. I wish I had invented it! I purchased 1500 cards on-line for $25, got another 3000 from a BGG member who was extremely generous, and those should give me enough enjoyment to play with my kids when they get old enough. My rating loses points for the CCG aspect. It costs too darn much. I'll never be purchasing cards one at a time.

A great game system. Situations can get really tricky at times and playing requires planning and thinking. I'm usually playing draft with custom rules for speeding up the setup time. The game can be also played over Internet either on Magic Online or for free using MWS - with pictures and all. I have a collection of 13k cards - 3 duplicates max and total budget has been only around 100e (found the first 3000 cards from a dumbster!!). :)

Update: not true :( After 10 years away from the game, I purchased my friend Mike's collection, traded for some more here on the geek, and I am now completely addicted again.

RATING: 9
rating is based SOLELY on cube draft / winston draft / 8 player sealed draft / sealed league formats.  i do not think i have much interest in playing any other way.  my cube is in the final stages of being assembled / acquired and i think this will be a great way to play going forward (it can also be used for winston drafts).

*****

I really enjoy cube drafting and have enjoyed putting together a starting cube.  Looking forward to trying it out many more times and then tweaking it here and there.  This is a really great way to play magic without getting caught up in the 'suitcase of cards' and just enjoy the phenomenal aspects of deck construction/hand management/actual play.

*****

Cube drafting / Winston drafting is just a fantastic format and a really well done game.  Dominion/Thunderstone/other clones, while entertaining in their own right, are inferior to Magic.  

Magic does what they do even better.  

Again, this rating and my desire for play is only for the limited format... I have zero interest in playing Magic on any other front.

*****

I have a great common/uncommon cube and think I am going to work on assembling a Ravanica 2-1-1 cube.

RATING: 7.5
I guess I have a strange perspective having played Pokemon first... so there's five types of energy in Pokemon, and five types of land in Magic, huh? who knew. So, it's far from obvious to me what the significant differences in gameplay are. It feels like having to attach energy to cards makes for more tough decisions. Maybe Magic is less swingy because it doesn't have so many cards allowing you to search through your deck and such... or maybe it isn't. And, it's not really the differences in gameplay that matter, is it? It's the deckbuilding. So I'll get back to you in a couple years...

I was furiously addicted to this back in '94-'97, but lost interest after a few dumb expansions.  I was drawn back in recently and am enjoying the game all over again.

RATING: 10
My only rated game without any recent plays... but I'm looking back to years and years of fond memories (both casual and competitive). The distribution model sucks, but the game is awesome.

Update: Finally played this again. Yay! My wife seems to like it quite a bit.

A word of advice: From my experience, if you are teaching new players then please use real decks, not bad crap decks. Sure, an overly complicated tournament combo/control deck might be too much. However, a solid beatdown deck (even tournament level) gives much more play satisfaction than using whatever cards you found behind the shelf...

RATING: 9
One of my very favorites, among the best games ever. The. Art in the cards, the flavor (card names, mechanichsm, flavor text, all combining beautifully), the variety of formats, the constant renewal othe cardpool... sadly, that goes hand in hand with the price, it's the only drawback this game has: one has to constantly pour money on it. But if you can spare it, it's worth it.

RATING: 2
This game is a money-magnet, and provides very little joy as compared to the amount of money you have to put into it. The game mechanics are simplistic and random. Rules are short, but patches for loopholes can span hundreds of pages. 

While there are other games which also appeal to the addictive and collecting mentality, this one gives very little in return. There is an entire secondary market for the MTG cards where they can be traded for ridiculous amounts of money (REAL money) - you could buy an entire boardgame for the amount of money for which you can get a single stupid piece of paper with a picture and some text on it. 

I'm glad I saw the real face of this hobby in time and dodged this bullet...

[played 50+ times]

A good game, with intriguing mechanichs. 
Like checks, you have to study and try to be a good player (and know how build a good deck). Unlike checks it's an expensive game: buying cards for a good deck can be expensive. 
Like other collectible games, who has a deck with more powerful cards and have much time to spend in building an testing his deck, is more likely to win. 
I play for fun, so I don't want spend too much time in testing magic's deck... I think there's other interesting things in life worth my time :-)
Anyway, I like playing once in a while

I was introduced to this game in highschool in the 90s by a friend.  I thought it was alright, but nothing I'd want to play regularly.  THEN he told me that the game could get more interesting if you go buy more cards to make better decks.  He didn't get it at first, but right away I saw the "he who spends the most money wins" greed of this game and I pretty much refused to play it after that.

Then I went off to college and met people in college who played it on Friday nights.  I always declined.  Inevitably, every game they played was a yelling match over who's card did what and how people interpretted the cards.  Sometimes I'd watch them play for my own amusement and I found just about every player interpretted cards differently each and every game depending on how it benefitted them.

Needless to say, this game is horrible.  Games are meant to be played to have fun and give everyone a somewhat fair shot.  Not be left open to miscellaneous interpretation and he who spends the most wins the most.

A colossal money-drain that was initially dominated by gamers, enthusiasts, hobbyists and collectors. It quickly devolved into a land-grab of rules lawyers, fanboys and min-maxers not unlike a big group of pre-teens playing D&D.

Too simple compared to other Collectibles out there. Too fast. The best deck wins, not the best player.

So so simple.....every card game has cards with abilities why this one is better?

The mother of all CCGs changed the world all by itself. If I had unlimited resources, I'd play all the time, because then I'd be able to buy cards for all my opponents. Since I don't have unlimited resources, I only get to play with the socially challenged on MTG:O, and even then it still costs money! But I keep thinking about deck ideas, following set releases and reading MTG articles anyway. Curse those Wizards and their cleverly constructed business model!

EDIT: stopped following the MTG circuit online, will probably not start again. Downgrading my rating.

RATING: 7
Don't make eye contact with it- it will suck you in! I played MTG for about ten years (from Unlimited through the Urza's cycle, relapsing briefly for Ravnica/Time Spiral) and had some small tournament success. Mostly, though, it was me and some friends spending the evening together, playing a casual game or banging out deck ideas. Lots of great memories here, but enough to outweigh the money and time spent or the compulsive behavior this model encourages? Maybe not. But for at least 8 of those 10 years this was what I did, and I loved it.

What can you say about Magic? It's the greatest collectible card game (CCG) to have ever existed.

It is an expensive CCG, though. Wizards of the Coast are awesome at releasing regular updates for the game, but it can be overwhelming to get into. If you're interested, consider buying some of the pre-made decks to get a feel for the game. Or, but a few fat packs and spend an afternoon drafting cards with some friends. In any case, you're bound to have a good time.

Tried it back in '94 when it started getting hot.  It seemed to me that success had less to do with in-game skill and more to do with what was in ones deck.  There may be a great game underneath the collectible aspect but I never really experienced it.

While writing this I considered maybe I should give MtG another shot, after all it has become quite a phenomenon.  However, quite frankly there are already too many fantastic games wanting me to play them that it doesn't make sense to devote time to something that doesn't seem like it's for me.

A great game; endlessly fun, easy to learn but hard to master.  Constant evolution of the game keeps it feeling fresh and interesting, but if you want to play with all the newest cards you will be spending a lot of money in the process.  Even with this caveat, this is very enjoyable game and if you are not competitive (and can resist amassing too many cards -- just tweaking one or two decks with the new sets) can actually be fairly inexpensive.

I no longer play, but it will always hold a special place for me. I was a big MtG junkie for many many years, but friends move away and times change. The bulk of my collection has since been sold off. Recently I've been able to trade many of my old cards online to build my board game collection. I still have plenty of cards to build decks with if I ever wanted to play again.

I've waffled on the rating for this one. It's not something I play anymore and don't want to play all the time, so by the BGG definition it's probably a 6. However, I LOVED this game for years and have so many fond memories from it, I think I have to give it a 10, a sort of lifetime achievement award. That feels right.

12/2012 - Doubt I'll ever get back into this one... Some friends were playing it at family Christmas party and told me about it. "Magic? Yeah, I've played Magic before." They seemed interested and enjoyed the little bit they played with a family member. Maybe... no.

4/2013 - It's back! A couple of the guys in our group have gotten a hold of cards. I played several games with the cousin who introduced them to the game. I suggest we maybe start a commons draft pool to throw into on random game nights...

RATING: 10
While there's a certain part of me that resists rating Magic a 10, at this point I can't deny its draw for me and feel compelled to give it my second-ever perfect score. My resistance comes down to the matches of Magic themselves, which in the narrowest sense is all Magic is as a "game." These matches can often be rather anticlimactic, feeling like they're over before they've even begun: one deck is clearly better than the other overall, the deck are evenly matched but it's a good matchup for one deck over the other (i.e., Aggro > Control > Midrange > Aggro), one player gets mana screwed/flooded, and so on. (I'm sure it's even worse in constructed formats, where more expensive decks will of course tend to do better, but thus far I have strictly played limited formats.) But once you've gotten a critical mass of games under your belt, these matches start to merge into one another. Yeah, you drew too many lands and lost the first match, but your managed to win the other two, so overall you're left feeling a bit more control. You can take what you learned from one best-of-three match and apply it to the next one, what you learned from one draft and apply to the next, from one format to another, and so on and so forth. There's a fluidity between discreet matches that lends to the game being greater than the sum of its parts.

This fluidity comes in part from the deckbuilding aspect of the game, which takes on many forms, depending upon the format you play. For limited players, it's about drafting and building a new deck every time you engage in a session of Magic. For constructed players, it's about building a deck ahead of time that can stand on its own in most matches while also successfully navigating a shifting metagame. For cube designers--which I consider a sort of "meta-deckbuilding"--it's about composing a "deck" from which others can draft their own decks and compete against each other in interesting and varied games of Magic. For whatever reason, I seem to have zoomed out yet another level, coming up with [url=http://games.mulrah.com/Magic%20the%20Gathering/]a series of cube design projects[/url] by which players can draft decks from various planes through out Magic's history. Of course, the more one zooms out, the less this "game" seems like an actual game, and the more it's a process of game design or--less romantically--perhaps simply collecting. It's at this level I seem to be entranced with Magic, having put in hours upon hours of design/collecting, backed nearly 500 actual matches of Magic. Despite this absurd amount of time already devoted to this game, I can honestly say I'm as happy to play it now as I was when I first tried it out, and that is [i]really[/i] saying something. A 10 it is!

[b]Ice Age[/b]

I can't say I enjoy much of the art or annoying mechanics like Cumulative Upkeep, but it's still Magic. Based on a single draft, I don't think it's all that horrible and would be willing to give it another go someday. GR was able to put together a passable Aggro deck that exerted early pressure but unfortunately ran out of steam against a dominant BU Control deck. So yeah, the standard strategies in Magic exist here, and the decks felt more functional than the stuff you'd get from a pile of crap cards (Believe me, I know).

[b]Core Cube[/b]

Using Magic 2014 as the foundation, but heavily edited to push it close to [url=https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/694888/core-set-cube]delirimouse's Core Cube[/url]. My initial play of this, when it was mostly Magic 2014 and lacking Rares, was decidedly underwhelming. But I rebuilt it around some clear themes, threw in some Rares, and retried it to great effect. Sure, it lacks the subtleties of some of Magic's finer sets, but at least you can make some solid, interesting decks that actually [i]do[/i] stuff. The singleton format add to the replayability of both the decks and the set as a whole. I highly recommend anyone interested in Magic, game design, and/or draft formats to give building a Core Cube a try.

[b]Kamigawa[/b]

I originally had this as a rough simulation of Champions of Kamigawa, but I've since overhauled it to include the entire block. (Don't worry; the influence of Saviors is minimal.) The result is an interwoven web of possibilities, all hung together under a spectacular theme. They might not all be winners, but there are two to three [i]dozen[/i] decks in here. I consider a set "solid" if it has one for each of the ten color pairs, so this has the potential to be amazing. Even if some of these decks end up not being very strong, at least they're in there to try. This one's going to have a long lifespan in my collection.

Comments on Champions of Kamigawa Draft-Sim: I thought this was excellent. Unlike some drafts, where your deck builds itself from the cards you drafted, I felt like I could have built my deck a few different ways. Even the deck I ended up with had several interesting things going on. In other words, I would be willing to play that same deck again, rebuild from the same stack of cards I drafted, and draft the exact same color combination again. Multiply that times ten for every color pairing, and then some: that's your replayability for this set.

[b]Mirrodin Cube[/b]
[i]Popular Planes Collection, Artifacts[/i]

Though many veteran players consider Mirrodin excellent for drafting, I didn't find it all that interesting. It seemed like you wanted to just play a fairly Aggro Creatures + Equipment strategy, and that was that. Kill Reviews in [url=blog.killgold.fish/2014/09/kill-reviews-mirrodin-block.html]wonders whether Artifacts theme can really work as the focus of a set[/url], as it seems to subdue too much of the color pie dynamic that makes Magic the game it is.

That said, Sealed Deck was an entirely different story for me. Without a draft, you can't default to a single strategy: sure you'll throw whatever Equipment you got into your deck, but you're forced to consider other strategies to make your card pool work. The preponderance of Artifacts adds to the flexibility and variety of options, making a number of decks viable with any given pool. This is a format I'd happily play again.

[b]Theros Block Cube[/b]
[i]Distributed Planar Collection II (Brian)[/i]

I can see why some veterans found Theros bland. It's just solid down-the-middle Magic, not pushing the game too far in any one direction. In boardgamer parlance, it's almost like a "post-gateway" version of Magic, perfect after some starter decks or drafting a Core Set. The new mechanics are straightforward (though Bestow has caused a couple headaches), and the the flavor is through the roof, especially if you stick with the base set. The expansions add some more depth, opening up some "sideways" strategies that weren't all that prevalent in Theros alone. Invasion, which we played alongside Theros for a while, provided the perfect counterpoint: it was initially more mind-blowing, since we hadn't really drafted a multicolor set, and some of its old school tendencies proved tough to play around. But that wore off pretty quickly, whereas Theros has continued to deliver solid Magic every time I bring it to the table. We'll probably move on soon, but we definitely found the set entertaining and worthwhile.

[b](Return to) Ravnica Cube[/b]
[i]Popular Planes Collection, Multicolor[/i]

My face-to-face plays with this set have been limited to homemade pre-constructed decks made mostly from Commons and Uncommons. The diversity in strategies between the guilds is excellent, but some guilds--at least the way I've built the decks--were definitely stronger than others. Add to this the rock-paper-scissors nature of Aggro-Midrange-Control, and it can feel like matches were determined before you played your first card. Ultimately, I think I got the balance at least as good as it is with Blue Moon Legends, which was my inspiration for taking the dive into Magic in the first place, but it's hard to feel like you ever got it "right" with such a customizable game.

I might go back to the pre-constructed decks, but for now I think I'm going to transition this set to a draft format, hopefully imbuing it with enough cards from the original set to recapture some of its legendary status as one of the greatest limited formats of all time. If that works, this rating could rise.

[b]Rise of the Eldrazi[/b]
[i]Top Draft-Sim Collection, Top-Down Flavor[/i]

Wow, this was excellent, and it was just my hodge-podge adaptation of the set! This managed to mix positive aspects of several draft sets all into one. Like Theros, it's got great flavor: the Levelers give it a touch of the D&D feel, even if the "adventure world" theme from Zendikar is gone. Like Mirrodin, it feels different: those Eldrazi spawn provide a whole new aspect to the game that's fun to explore. Probably most importantly--like Champions of Kamigawa--there seem to be many ways to take your deck, though my first impression here is that it's not [i]quite[/i] as nuanced. As I was sifting through my drafted cards, several strategies emerged, so it felt like a more mindful draft could have taken the deck in a number of other directions. In addition, despite what I've read elsewhere, all the cards felt very playable. (Maybe the complaints aren't focused on the Commons and Uncommons that comprise the majority of the Limited environment.) So yeah, replayability seems through the roof, and I don't even have all the cards in here, having made a number of substitutions with cards from Magic 2014.

[b]Leftovers Pauper Sphere[/b]

I definitely believe everything is relative in Magic: a weak card in one format can be a champ in another. I think that can expand to entire sets, so a properly designed set of weaker cards could be similar to a stronger set, just a couple turns slower. (You could probably just let everyone start with two lands in play, and it would be almost the same!) However, it is apparently possible to take it too far, and that's what happened here.

I took a bunch of Commons that got poor ratings on Gatherer and tried to make a "Crap Cube" ("[url=http://www.mtgsalvation.com/forums/the-game/the-cube-forum/cube-lists/192526-360-sphere-nofs-sphere]Sphere[/url]") out of them. I even tossed in some mediocre cards to serve as the set's "Rares" and tried to arrange things around various themes, but they were in some cases too horizontal (e.g., flyers in every color), so every color played the same. It seemed to draft okay, but the matches took forever, with decks just trading Creatures 1-for-1 until they had no more cards in hand, at which point you're just drawing a card every turn, hoping it can get a few points of damage in before it too is eliminated.

Anyway, I do think it's possible to create a set out of "crap" that works, but this wasn't it.

[b]Onslaught[/b]

Onslaught reminds me of early games from prolific designers (specifically, I'm thinking of Martin Wallace). They possess many of the same features of their younger, more popular siblings, and they always have a contingent of rabid fans who claim so-and-so never managed to top this "underrated" early design. However, for most players, the more recent, more acclaimed games really are better.

In Onslaught's case, I've found my games to be hit-or-miss. A prolonged board stall (and reports of many more online), a couple games lost to mindless Creature overruns ("It's just Aggro."), and some weird tangential mini-games (Menacing Ogre) could individually be excused as the "character" of the set. But when taken together, they give the impression of a clunky design. Furthermore, I'm learning that I'm a player who appreciates synergy in his decks and the sets they come from, and in this regard Onslaught seems lacking. I did manage to pull off one mildly synergistic deck, but it felt more like a rickety Datsun pickup whose loosely fitting parts clicked together just barely enough to get it onto the highway. Oh, and it had a machine gun duct-taped to the top, which would be illegal today, but kicks ass when it's allowed.

As with all such designs, I'm sure there's an alternate reality in which I myself am one of the aforementioned rabid fans. But for now, I think it's basically a placeholder for Lorwyn, a [url=blog.killgold.fish/2014/11/kill-reviews-lorwyn-mini-block.html]reputedly more synergistic tribal set[/url].

[b][url=http://www.cubetutor.com/cubeblog/70317]Old School Cube[/url][/b]

This custom draft set includes only cards released prior to Weatherlight. Typically sets drawing from such a large card pool elicit a higher rating from me, because I feel like I'm able to work a lot of variety and intricacy into the set's design. While that's generally been the case with this set, I'm not as convinced it will actually play out this way. In addition, the archetypes here are pretty broad and generic (e.g., ramp, flyers, etc.) and in some cases either flimsy (enchantments) or "unfun" (land destruction). To make the set less about drafting a select few bombs and really force the exploration of the archetypes, I eschewed cube staples like Lightning Bolt and Swords to Plowshares, but that meant I really had to dig deep to get this just to 270 cards. Hopefully stuff like Caribou Range and Homarid Spawning Bed will at least get a chuckle from drafters, but I have limited expectations around those cards actually making it into decks.

That said, I am pretty pleased with how this turned out. The archetypes should vary depending on how you tackle them and offer a lot of flexibility since they're built across three colors. Some unique strategies and play styles you don't see anymore are built into this set, and I think it'll get its fair share of play with the right crowd. Unlike other Old School cubes that focus on recreating the deck brewing of the early days, this set asks the question, "How can overlooked old cards come together to create a draftable set?" Knights are a thing, and you can ping the board clear in Blue and White. Jokulhaups can drive unique enchantment strategies, and the tools for an old school Pestilence deck are in here too. At the same time, there are plenty of classics like Shivan Dragon, Savannah Lions, and so on in here, so the nostalgia should be flowing freely even in this low-powered environment.

Update: Actual play bears out my instincts. As with modern designs, most of the decks are fairly typical at their core, but have some kind of "spin" on them in accordance with the setting or theme. In this case, the spin tends to be old school. A recent successful Black-Red deck was unsurprisingly aggressive, but it also had a land destruction subtheme that kept the opponent at bay in an indirect way. The White-Blue deck of course had some flyers, but it kept opposing threats under control by constantly tapping them down or pinging them. Both of these spins on typical decks would probably be viewed as "unfun" by modern players, but I find them interesting variants worth exploring. I'm glad I put this together and hope to see it get some more plays.

[b]Otaria Cube[/b]
[i]Popular Planes Collection, Tribal + Graveyard[/i]

This themed Cube combines the Odyssey and Onslaught blocks into a single set based in Otaria. I built it around archetypes for each color, color pair, and shard, and I kept the power level as flat as possible while still including many of the defining cards of the era. While that's all quite exciting from a functional deckbuilding standpoint, I must confess the flavor of this set is considerably lacking. Once I get into it more, maybe I'll be forgiving, but for now it's a barrier to wanting to engage with the set, so I'm docking it a point for theme.

[i]Distributed Planar Collection I (Chris)[/i]

Having played [url=www.cubetutor.com/cubeblog/72249]my version of Invasion[/url] several times now, I feel better about drawing some conclusions about it. As the first multicolor set I drafted, I definitely appreciated the new challenge balancing your mana presents, but I suspect future multicolor sets will outshine this one. Grixis (UBR) seems to be the strongest color combination, since it has the best removal, and aggressive decks aren't very strong in this set. If other players aren't aware of this, then draft these colors and win. If other players are aware of this, then you're in for some tough, grindy games, where you eke out tiny advantages through careful combinations of the myriad activated abilities in this set (most of which require that mana balancing act I mentioned earlier). Kavu and Soldiers never really worked, but damn those Saprolings! Five-color decks are a thing, and there's probably something to be said for a self-bouncing ETB deck. But this seems like less variety than most modern sets, even if in play the decision-making is a little more gnarly. I'm happy to return to this set for the occasional challenge, but I look to others for the fun.

[b][url=http://www.cubetutor.com/cubeblog/82138]Dragons of Tarkir Draft-Sim/Cube[/url][/b]
[i]Distributed Planar Collection III (Jeremy)[/i]

This set--based on the official Dragons of Tarkir limited format (DTK-DTK-FRF)--ended up being pretty solid. I pushed the Fate Reforged side of it and amped up the dragons, resulting in a bit more deck diversity than the original. In fact, our final session with this set saw two decks based on enemy colors (WB Warriors, RW Go Wide) go 2-1, while the allied decks went 1-2. The allied themes (e.g., Bolster in Green and White) play well as subthemes for the decks built around enemy colors. While there are some dominant cards, the set felt less top-heavy than, say, Invasion, despite Fate Reforged's reputation as a bomb-driven format.

Nonetheless, I was ready to move on from this set the instant we started playing it. The mechanical themes are either repetitive (e.g., +1/+1 counters in White and Green...again) or boring (e.g., caring about Power/Toughness), and there aren't any fun thematic (albeit crappy) cards like there were in Theros (e.g., Akroan Horse). In retrospect, this set might have been even better than Theros as an introductory set, but at this point I'm hoping for more interesting dynamics from these "expert" sets. This format wasn't bad, and I'd certainly play it again for some solid vanilla Magic, but there are many more interesting options out there.

RATING: 7
[b]Zendikar Cube[/b] (mostly Battle for Zendikar block)
[i]Distributed Planar Collection IV[/i]

I think I'm going to settle on a solid 7 for this set, which is based largely on the unpopular Battle for Zendikar. The design process was very interesting, as I tried to address the set's weaknesses by incorporating themes from Oath of the Gatewatch, original Zendikar, and Worldwake. I believe I was ultimately successful, which gives me an aura of pride when considering it, but ultimately all I managed to do was get this from being a weak set with few playable decks to hitting straight down the middle with about ten or so archetypes. That's about on par with Theros, which also settled in at a 7.

Design Impressions: In putting this set together, I had to learn all the inherent strategies to make sure I'm including them in the set in a balanced way. My experience echoed the opinions voiced on the Limited Resources podcast: this is a very complex set. Coming off Dragons of Tarkir, which was a cinch to put together, I am finding Battle for Zendikar satisfyingly challenging. I am cautiously hoping to upgrade green a bit, so it's not as nerfed at it was in the original, but just getting a baseline understanding of how the original ticked has been quite the puzzle. Despite the horrid reviews coming from some camps, I must say I am looking forward to playing this one!

Play Impressions: Having tried most of the color combinations in actual play, I can confirm this is a very solid set. It's not as thematically entertaining as Theros, but the decks are a bit more interesting, and I feel like I'm seeing a few more surprises. I'm about to embark on another tour through this set, which is more than can be said for Tarkir. (It's worth noting my appreciation thus far has been in direct proportion to the number of sets I stuffed into a given set. Tarkir = 2, Theros =3, Zendikar =4.)

I can't say I'm too excited about this one. The promise of a multicolor set devolved into the usual routine of color-pair archetypes, and even then it's just the allied archetypes. A closer look reveals even these "pairs" are largely focused on a single color that just leans a little in one direction or another depending on the allied color in its deck. Thankfully, there are some subthemes in each color, but this structure is remarkably similar to the relatively uninteresting Dragons of Tarkir format, which I gave the same rating. All in all, it's still Magic--I'm sure I'll enjoy it--but I'll probably be ready to move on fairly quickly.

[b]Leftovers Cube[/b]

It turns out that even a pile of leftover cards can turn into a decent draft, as long as you're intentional about it. My previous experiments with this had been nothing more than color-balanced, with no thought given to archetypes, so you were putting together decks that simply did nothing but get into a long slog of hopeless topdecking. Maybe I got lucky with this particular card pool, as it seemed to have some basic themes baked in already, but all I had to do was handpick a few more crappy cards, and suddenly I have another draftable set. It probably favors some archetypes over others, but a least you'll be able to make some slightly synergistic decks. For me, it's probably worth a play or two just to see how things shake out, and those plays--unlike with my prior experiments--won't be painful.

[i]Distributed Planar Collection X[/i]

I found this set to be quite interesting to put together. Although many of the strategies are "linear," the linearities are cross-cutting, so I don't think you're on rails too much. Baking in Shadowmoor was a challenge but should give the draft experience more variety while also enhancing Lorwyn's tribal synergies. There are at least 15 decks baked into this, with several based in 3-color shards. While that latter point opens up the possibility that there might be different "flavors" of, say, Wizards decks, depending upon how you pair up White, Blue, and Black, I'm not sure these builds will feel all that different, so I'm rating this set conservatively for now. If actual play reveals more variety between these decks or some surprise archetypes emerging, I can see myself upping my rating.

[b]Rath[/b]
[i]Distributed Planar Collection V[/i]

This set is essentially a physical version of Tempest Remastered, which was a redesign of the Rath Cycle released by Wizards of the Coast for MTGO. The set is not designed around archetypes, and each color focuses on doing its own thing rather than carving out ways it can partner with other colors. As a result, drafts will probably focus grabbing the top cards and building the support to make them as effective as possible, as opposed to crafting a unique deck. The set has been described as "solid two-color Magic," which is evocative of some of my less favored sets.

One advantage for me is that I had very little to do with the design of this set: it's just 2x Commons, 1x Uncommons, and 45 Rares from Tempest Remastered. Therefore, I won't really know what I'm doing going into it and might be pleasantly surprised. I'm guessing I'll enjoy it for a few plays and then be ready to move on to the next set.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

The game starts off fun, and then becomes a money sink.

I'd like it more if it wasn't so... expansive.

Ich spiele Magic seit 1994/1995 und auch 20 Jahre später, findet es noch immer regelmäßig den Weg auf den Spieletisch. Früher eher mit selbst erstellten Decks (Constructed), heute eher in der Variante Cube oder Booster Draft und es macht jedes Mal einfach Spaß. Für mich ist Magic das beste 2-Personen Spiel, aber auch die Mehrspielerformate, wie Commander können überzeugen!

RIP, Jan 1995 - Jun 1999. Was so much stinking fun. A year in, stumbled into a tournament at the last second and won the thing which totally ruined me. Was obsessed with competitive for the next 3 years even though I lived in Germany and it was so hard to find players. Basically picked my college based on finding a roommate who played. After regionals '99, I was too burnt out to continue. Sad because eventually developed the nerves and attitude that are needed in some environments. I would play for fun now--the cards are SO much cooler now than when I played--but not spend money on it again.

Best CCG ever. Although this game appears to have as many detractors as fans, you cannot deny the impact this game has had on the industry.  Some (okay, more than some) will say that it has had a negative impact by spawning that evil, addictive, money-grubbing machine called CCG.  Overall, I believe that it has had a positive effect by opening the portal to new concepts in games; novel approaches to gaming and events; combining collecting and gaming in an unique fashion (which is just one of the many reasons we hang out on BGG anyway); not to mention the creative and evolving gaming engine at the core of the game.  And we have not even touched upon the fact it is still one of the most (if not the most) played game logged on BGG.   Even with its fleas, Magic the Gathering clearly deserves to be in the Top 100.

I first got into MTG when I was 14. Now I'm 28 and I  still play it occasionally. A very good game.

The usual problems with all card games is still present here; too much reliance on card draw, and it's too easy to make combos that are practically unbeatable.

But it also has a simple/endlessly addictive gameplay, coupled with beautiful artwork. I still enjoy casual collecting, deck building and playing.

This is the ultimate CCG. Almost infinite replayability. The game has a strong following, so finding new people to play with is very easy. Can be as casual or deep as you want it to be. There is a huge card pool and thriving tournament scene.

I played Magic for quite a while after it first came out.  Quit, and a buddy and I just picked up some Kamigawa "tournament" decks so we could play out of the starter.  It's now a VERY smooth ride, but the theme (as always) is just pasted on.  So it looses points to L5R, NetRunner, Vampire, and even CoC because you actually feel you are IN those worlds.  With Magic, however cool the combos or however Magic the art...not so much.

Wonderful game in its simplicity, once you know a few basic rules, there is no limit. Close to 9 but the "shop-o-holic" aspect of the game drags it down to 8. What I mean is that you just can´t say no to a new booster pack every now and then.

RATING: 6
You get a tremendous deck with tons of really cool cards...and you get to use about 10 of them. You can lose based on the first hand you draw (mulligans short-hand you and compound the problem). I can't imagine this being fun in a tournament setting because it's so dependent on the luck of the draw. It feels like "The first one to get more mana out wins". If you play with friends, it's fine. Don't understand the appeal of full-blown obsession with this game.

RATING: 6
Played this a LOT in the mid 90s and cost me lots of $$$. 
The core action and combat system game is OK as light fare with nice graphics. Because the core game is so simple there is a lot of flexibility in the game format(eg team-based multiplayer, drafting, etc). The main thing that really puts me off, though, is the continual rule changes created by the endless (and expensive) stream of new cards. It also means that the rules ARE the cards, so you spend a lot of time time adjusting to the implications of new expansions. It all makes for an expensive way to keep the core game fresh. I'd rather play a game that has a core set of rules with expansions that everyone can access without spending hundreds of dollars on booster packs. I would never get back into this game with the aim of developing a collection, but it might be good as a filler/beer & pretzels game set around a draft cube.

M:tG, along with D&D, is one of the most influential games of all time, with respect to game design and mechanics. I haven't played it in years, and may never play it again. Still, I have a place for Magic in my special book of people to whom props are given. I think it would be interesting to compare boardgames released prior to M:tG and after; it might be more clear what Garfield did with the development of this game.

RATING: 9
I played a lot back in the day (until the end of 90s), but after that, due to it being a ccg and the lack of people to play with, I've only played the various computer versions, mostly against AIs. But it is still a marvellous game and the buzz I got from it as a kid is unparallelled to this day. But the golden age for me was certainly until Fourth Edition, after that it lost its "magic" (har).

Actually, I would like to start collecting/playing again, but don't have any friends who'd accompany me, so...

Oh dear. I have a hate/ love relationship with this one. 

The game is not complicated, it is just complex: meaning that the turn structure is simple, but there are so many tiny little rules to pay attention to that I lost many games due to overlooking a word or a similar little detail. 

Still, I find myself semi-regularly going to small, friendly events, and get either mana flooded or chrushed by my superior opponents. The whole mana mechanic makes no sense, and yet I think it is part of the appeal to the game: much like poker, you can always blaim the cards. 

This is a very serious game if played at high levels but I have no desire to do that. I despise it, and yet i love it. Or maybe I am a victim of it? 

Nevertheless, gathering with a bunch of friends, opening packs, building decks and clashing is just plain fun.

RATING: 6
Beh...  I used to be a big fan in the starting years, and the game is brilliant, I've just burned out.  But the collectible part of the game just went a bit (a lot?) out of hand.  Suffers way too much from the fact that players spending more money on the game will be able to build vastly superior decks (note, more cards does not necessarily equal better player of course).  Also the amount of new expansions is just not doable anymore.  During recent games I played, I found myself spending more time reading other people's cards than actually playing...  which is also a downside.  You need to know about too many cards (which you may not own and therefor probably didn't even know they existed) to play well...  I can be tempted to play a preconstructed deck against another preconstructed deck, but I really have to be in the mood.

I'm a casual player.  I had a small collection of the first edition (Alpha?) when M:tG was just "gathering" momentum.  Since I only played it once with my non-gamer roomate, I traded some for wargames and sold the rest.  Ten years later I played M:tG (9th edition) with a neighbor whose collection was collecting dust.  Then a couple of friends in my regular game group got interested about the time M10 was released.  Now M:tG is one of my 8 year-old (update: now 11) daughter's favorite games and we play it several times a week.  Great game.

Magic is certainly an evocative game. It has a lot going for and against it. The depth and scope of the game is both an attribute and its downfall. I have played many, many games of this and exploring the deck-building aspect of the game was interesting but honestly I think I've done that to death. The game is arguably broken in casual play when you consider all the permutations and incredibly strong combinations that exist and how anyone with enough money and resources can basically design an unbeatable deck against someone with lesser resources and money. This aspect of the game is a turn off to me and what generally killed the game for me. 

Yes I know you can play with variants like drafting and cubes and EDH what not... but essentially I think I've been there, done that by now. Not in the sense that I'm the greatest Magic player around and I've explored every nuance of every type of deck.. but that I've done enough with the game to know that it's just another way to mix, combo, re-mix, re-combo... and it goes on endlessly. Decks and combos until the end of time.

Again, I feel that vast, open system is both a feature and a flaw. Yes I can still have a fun, casual game of Magic and play the game with a few friends, but that endless making of decks and playing the game to discover more and more nuances is essentially stale for me.

There are only so many times I want to build up a multitude of decks catered to take my opponent down from 20/40 life points. It all becomes repetitive and monotonous with the illusion that there is "real" variety and variability.

I still admire the concept of Magic and their ability to continually push out seemingly interesting and "fresh" ways to play the game (and continuing to make zillions of dollars off the new crops of addicts is remarkable as well)... but I've certainly gone past the point of being interested enough to actually continue playing regularly. 

Originally a great game as I discovered the possibilities... gradually dulled down to good game as I endlessly built and rebuilt decks and played the game sometimes endlessly... and now an ok game at best. Still admired but not enough to keep my rating up or have enough interest in it to actually seek out and play this repetitively.

Although cards like Timewalk and Ancestral Recall happen, it had been my favorite game. Too many pros for just a few cons ($$$, mana screw- although I like working with the land ratios).

I don't count this as a board game.  But I have sunk many thousands of hours of my life into playing this game.  I discovered this game as it was released, and as a child in 1993, this game was simply brilliant compared to anything else that existed at the time.  Even though I no longer play it any more, it really has stood the test of time and adapted well (I can only assume it is the most profitable board/card game ever by a vary large margin).

The game is good fun, unfortunately it's not so great if you play with people who shovel in all their extra money, or are consumed with only playing to beat every other player... then it's decidedly NOT fun.  This game also seems to attract the worst-of-the-worst sort of nerdlingers... the kind I'd be embarrassed for my wife to meet... and I'm often embarrassed myself just for being in their presence to overhear their nerd banter. I'll not repeat any of it here, but it usually involves the word "broken" and references to Timmy and Johnny, etc. What crap.

(I'm not discussing the economic model. There are a lot of cheap ways to play the game, they're just not sanctioned for competition. You can for instance make yourself a 500 card draft set for the price of a Dominion box.)

So I'm breaking my pattern of only commenting on games I don't like enough to keep them, because I can't recommend Magic unless you are okay with the following points:

- Land cards cause a small amount of games to be boring because entirely decided by draw issues. I'm okay with that because the enjoyment I get from the good games really makes up for the dull ones. This also implies MTG is meant to be played several times in a row where you can determine a winner from multiple games.
- Though the core principles are quickly learnt, the comprehensive rules are mind-blowingly complex. Even after decades, I sometimes find a card interaction or a timing issue that requires me to put on my DCI Judge shirt and dive into the 200+ pages of the comprehensive ruleset.
- As with all CCGs, MTG's official constructed environments are designed to last until the optimal competitive decks are figured out, rather than with strong game balance and diversity in mind. And for the amount of time it takes, you'd rather design your own game than try to craft a really healthy and sustainable constructed format from the existing rules and card pool.

Brilliant game. Famous for being the first CCG.

I loved the metagame in deckbuilding and collecting. The gameplay is fresh, fast, and furious. Multiplay in different formats increases the fun exponentially.

However, the game rewards excessive purchasing habits, no matter what "they" say. This game will hurt your wallet, bad. Also, I don't like the powerplay where players try to find the most devastating combo's to win in turn 3. Boring.

Play this with the right friends, and restrict your purchases and this is a winner.

I was a MtG bitch back in the day (3rd/4th edition I think) but only ever bought 4 decks and a couple of expansion boosters.  One of these contained a rare Preacher card, who was pretty weak but very thematic and my favourite white card.  Eventually I was coerced into parting with it in exchange for about 150 cards and from there traded my collection up to a few thousand.  Lost many many hours of my school life to this game, but seeing some of my wealthier school friends literally spend thousands of pounds on it before burning out left a bitter taste in my mouth about collectible games of any kind.  Ingenious and devilish, I would have to be heavily persuaded to go in for a game, and my stashed away decks are even now still based on theme (Goblins vs. Elves) rather than killer combos.

Most of my cards were from the Beta set, used Unlimited/Revised for fillers/lands and new additions.

Yes, I played before the Black Lotus was 1 per deck, and had 2.  Also had 1 Mox Ruby (but didn't play red).

My primary deck was a green/black weenie 40-card deck.  My other deck was a blue control deck.  We always played for ante, so I never had many of my rares in one deck, though I did build a deck around Ancestral Recall and Time Walk for if I ever played a non-ante tournament.

If I only knew then what I know now I would have done a better job at keeping my cards safe.

I do not think I'll ever play again, too much investment, and too many cards now.  But was my main game for a few years.

RATING: 9
Putting aside any feelings on collectability for the moment, there is no doubt in my mind that Magic is the best designed CCG out there.  Its basic mechanics are simple, but the depth that comes from the cards is amazing.  Add to that many, many different viable strategies, and you have a game with unequaled strategic depth.

The collectible aspect can be a problem for some, but I think WotC has done a really good job of making the game very playable for people that don't want to spend too much or want to jump in late in the game.  The game can get very expensive, and to be a competitive player the initial cost is very high, but this is one of the best games made.  If you want to try it out, play some draft or sealed deck, both of which are excellent formats.

The standard of TCG&#039;s. Played it for years but eventually grew tired of it. Switched to SW:CCG, but that environment got broken down like so many other alternative TCG&#039;s.

Brilliant game design by Richard Garfield. Idea of instants, interrupts, and casting costs leads to an amazing game. Too bad there were too many expansions, and too many cards, which made it too expensive, and too hard to keep track of the cards. I wonder if the marketing has paid off in their strategy to print a million cards or if it has turned people like myself off it. Multiplayer (3 on 3) or around the table was fun as well. Still have too many cards left over, would like to sell them since no one else in the gaming group plays anymore.

Having avoided M:tG for years (I've played CCG's since 1995) by playing what I thought were better timed and better themed games like Shadowfist and L5R, I was intrigued by the computer game Duel of the Planeswalkers 2012.  This was a way for me to get a few decks of magic and play for less than $20.  I found out that I liked this version of magic and I've been more interested in the Duel Decks, Theme Decks, and Commander.  Going Standard looks like a money pit for me, so I'll be happy doing the pauper thing or just sticking to Pre-constructed decks.

The first and foremost of trading card games.  Its major advantage is ubiquity--it's easy to find tournaments or casual opponents.  Over the game's lifespan, the design has become quite streamlined, although flaws from the initial design remain.

The major problems compared to other games are considerable financial cost and the possible difficulty in finding others who play the same tournament or casual format.

Kudos to the game that started the craziness and turned an industry on its head. I dabbled in it for a year or so during the "Legends" and "Dark" era and enjoyed my time with it, and now have no desire to ever play this game again, but I still think of it as a genuinely inspired creation. The only problem for me is that the most enjoyable part seemed to be deck creation - after that, during the actual play, the players seem somewhat irrelevant as the decks did their thing.

RATING: 7
I have a enthusiastic nature to get involved in collectable card games. While Magic is the best I have played, I still am unable to shake my main gripe with such games. That is, to play at a competitive level, you need to invest a lot of $ into the game to get 'that card'. I just don't like when there is not an equal footing amongst players, no matter whether I am winning or losing. The game is also rapidly expanding whereby many cards become obsolete a little too fast!

I dislike the luck of the draw/mulligan handicap, and I don't like the collectible/money nature of the game. Some cards are useless without lands or timing can be off, but I'm sure there's a fair bit of tactical and strategic play, though I prefer modern designer games that have multiuse cards and such far more. Better than YGH and Pokemon CGs I suspect.

This is a very well thought out game with infinite possibilities.  The only reason M:tG gets less than 10 from me is because of the tendency to force players into buying rare combos in order to win games or tournaments and the fact that it becomes a very expensive habit.  If a game group decides not to fall into the rare combo trap, and stick with playing only the cards they have, I believe M:tG can be a blast and would allow exploring common and uncommon combo strategies that seldom get played.

Magic: The Gathering is still the best CCG I've played. I haven't played since Magic 2013 and played most during 2004-2007. Loved my cheap red goblin deck.

There's definitely a pay 2 win feeling for Magic. If you drop more money you'll get a better deck. 

If I had more time, money and people to play with I might pick it up again.

The brilliantly conceived game that kids with rich parents ruined for everyone.  Well, that, and 500 new cards every year.  I remember the days when people would trade Mox gems for extra basic lands.  I remember the fury and disgust aroused by the watered down and cheaply printed Revised Edition.  I remember the astoundingly underproduced Legends expansion selling out in the blink of an eye, and Wizards of the Coast refusing to print more despite massive consumer demand.  And yet I kept playing for years.  What the hell was wrong with me?!?

I think that the most interesting part of Magic is composing the deck. But in order to compose the deck you have to collect many cards. Collecting = having = uninteresting. Not my idea of boardgaming. I prefer a Go board (or a board of any game that I appreciate) in which there are infinite possibilities, open roads to the creativity of players and not creativity based on the designers making up new ideas to gain more and more money. Besides I don't like card driven games.

My rating of this game is even too kind, because of the original and innovating idea when it came out. But I am not going to play this, not interested at all.

Well, my experience with MTG started when I was a kid in the mid 90s.  Overall, it was an addicting game and my experiences were good for the most part.  Fast forward to a couple of years ago where I decided to pick it up as a hobby again.  Now that I'm smarter and less naive (and more aware of the great selection of independent games out there), I've found this game to be lacking.

First: Even after years of development, this game is still poorly balanced.  Set after set, my jaw drops in disbelief that they could not possibly realize how broken their cards continue to be.  This problem is so severe that we see that all tournament winning decks (and by extension many more competing decks) all revolve around a small number of cards.  If broken enough, rare cards are easily more expensive than their new category of legendary or super rares.  This level of ineptitude for a company that has the financial resources and experience that it does should be unacceptable by today's standards where many smaller independent company's have developed beautifully balanced games involving asymmetrical warfare (sorry I couldn't come up with a better term off the top of my head).

Second: This point regards the costs.  Now, I don't have a problem with games costing money and I understand that collectible cards games are a fun way to put a lot of money (in smaller more acceptable increments) into a hobby.  My point here regards the competence of Wizards of the Coast yet again.  Put simply, the "pros" and more in-touch MTG players don't even bother with booster packs.  To illustrate, pros playing the game online would sooner sell the booster packs to save up more money for buying specific cards in the market place.  So, this game has such severe balancing issues and such a rigid hierarchy in the value of cards that the purchasing of booster packs, which is supposed to be the most typical way casual and most players collect these cards, is cost inefficient and left for the "suckers".  Further one this point of costs, Wizards of the Coast even go against their own incentives to inflate the costs of cards.  They still don't ban cards that were clear mistakes in their major tournament (cough lotus needs to die cough).  They used to reprint older sets in boosters.  I've seen them and bought them.  They were a little more expensive, but I was okay with it and understood why.

Third: Finally, MTG is just an overrated game and is a drain on the gaming community as a whole.  Like I've hinted at, I believe there is talent out there to design superior games than MTG.  But there isn't a market for the collectable card game from a smaller company as it requires substantial distribution and widespread demand.  Bot most kids who play MTG don't know about other options and once they burn out on MTG like some of the other 1 ratings you see here, they sure as heck don't want to move onto another collectible card.  In conclusion, MTG needs to pass on to the next life.  It's not that bad of a game, but the ineptitude of Wizards of the Coast and the fact that there's so much more potential out there is evidence enough that MTG detracts from rather than contributes to the gaming community.

As an afterword, this is all my opinion.  Though, I do try to justify my opinion as much as possible.  I hope this review contributes to a larger discussion (which should be had).  Thanks for reading

I've tried out many CCGs and while some have some kind of mechanic or theme that is different from MTG and provide a distinct flavor of fun, MTG continues to be the top CCG for me since I found out about it back in 2000.

UPDATE:
The concept of resources (lands) in your deck that slow down the acquisition of the cards you need and are also required to play cards, feels outdated today.

I'd much rather play Android: Netrunner or any modern asymmetrical deck-based card game.

I've been off and on with this since 1994 and have never sold a card, but I hate tournament play. Build decks that are balanced against one another for friendly play and get them out when you're in the mood, and you'll see that there's a great game here.

Collection spans from Beta to Apocalypse. I don't really play the physical game anymore, but still enjoy playing online versions Legacy/T1 style.

Update: I recently rebuilt in physical form all 57 decks I used to play on Apprentice back in 1999-2001. I also bought my first box of cards in 15 years, though I still don't intend to ever get back into modern gameplay-- it was more for nostalgia sake. But I'm playing the physical game again casually and it's great.

What to say about a game that invented a market?  Well, it's truely impressive for what it accomplished given where it started.  Very fun to play, even still.  The collectable format is evil, but certainly clever from the game company's point of view.  Game play is strong in Magic, the key weakness being that you can get hosed if you don't draw the right opening hand (e.g. too little mana).   Got a little fiddily with the timing rules, but I forgive it given its origins.  I stopped collecting after about the first 20,000 expansions, so I don't really know the current state of the game.

Very rewarding and pioneering Collectable Card Game. IDEA - I don't collect anymore, so I set up a deck in each color (that I would play with so they are all good) and have that as a 'regular game' now.

Wants: Unopened boosters, only. I only play booster drafts these days.

To this day (started in 1994), this is one of my favorite games. Highly replayable, fast, great creative thinking. I admit that I enjoy the game a lot more now that I have an income that can easily afford $50/mth on magic cards alone. But if you wish to avoid the "whoever spends the most, wins the most" issue, I highly recommend drafts and sealed deck leagues where everyone has the same number of cards. MTGO has its issues but I really like the access to a larger number of people to play against.

Great mechanics and a diverse array of deck drafting possibilities continues to have an immense influence on gaming and is still a joy to play. Deck building is obviously limited by one's card pool, which can be costly to expand depending on what format you choose to play. Bulk commons are still an issue.  Finally, for a focused, 2-player game, the shuffled, blind draw of the deck feels a little antiquated, especially with games like Mage Wars.

I like MtG, and I will play MtG, but I think overall that MtG is probably not a good thing.  MtG requires players to continuously pour money into new cards in order to be competitive.  In addition, the variations of the game that have fallen into fashion (EDH for instance) further exacerbate the problem by requiring the player to invest in a larger collection.  There also seems to be a culture problem with MtG.  At any given MtG table you are likely to find at least one loudmouth jerk, and a handful of people that have neglected personal hygiene.  Put together, these elements have resulted in my only playing occasionally.

I was hooked on this game in three different phases of my life.  Every time I got sucked into it, I would start spending too much money just to think I had the best deck.  It becomes an addiction.  I think I would enjoy it more playing draft style of play, but than you need to go to all the meet-ups on Friday nights and play with all the unwashed hair kids.  To play casually would be my goal, however unattainable that is.  

Magic is a deck-building card game with thousands and thousands of cards to do that from.  The goal is to build a deck that kills and annoys your opponents the best.  Because they never stop making new editions to this game it becomes a never-ending time & money sink.

Very fun, if that is the only hobby you would like to concentrate on.

I remember the day when Magic stopped being about the fun: when magazines started printing prices for cards.  People stopped ante-ing, even when they knew damned well they'd eventually get their cards back.  They just didn't want to risk anything anymore, even something as simple as a piece of cardboard.

If we're talking about a small group of people locked into a set amount of cards, preferably by drafting or an LCG format, this rating catapults up to 8.  It's a very fun game that's been killed by the cottage industry that has surrounded it.

RATING: 6
Make no mistake - this game is addictive. It is addictive in the same way that gambling is addictive: it offers randomized payouts with large variance, both in what cards you receive when buying packs before the game and in what cards you draw during the game.

While it is easy to confuse addictiveness with fun, the two are not the same. In this case, the addictive qualities serve to disguise a clumsy design. The mana system is enormously frustrating, and there are surprisingly few interesting decisions in the Standard format. Let's not even go into the byzantine rule set. 

Magic does deserve credit for its thematic cleverness and for its many innovations, which have had an enormous influence on the hobby. Still, my final verdict is this: save yourself some suffering and burn your money in a fireplace, not on this game.

Remove the well advertised issue of funds being a major unbalancing factor (Like so much of life). And this is a fantastic game. 

I have a moderate size collection, but stopped around 5th edition as at this point it really kicked up a notch in terms of cycling through editions. I believe the focus very much went to the high end "professional" and league players and putting it out of reach or medium level occasional league players, who still wanted to be competitive, like myself.

But its still a great game.  Been cracking open a few old decks lately & playing with the boys and all of us have been having a blast.   It has the ability to scratch a lot of itches, great game play, deck building and collecting. 

Still the $ factor makes it a "keep away" for me, although we do own a few pre-built decks purchased in more recent years.

How do you "own" Magic?
How do you record "plays" of Magic?

It's great to have spend so much money so many years ago that it doesn't hurt anymore at all having spent that much money. :-)
I have a great collection of really OLD cards and do not have to bother about new cards, new rules or actual Magic players at all. Whoever wants to play Magic with me can use one of my decks or can browse through my collection and build his own. I guess, with that many cards, Magic will never become boring.

RATING: 3.5
Originally I'd given it a 7-8, played the heck out of it for awhile. But it just got to be a large overstuffed monster, with terriblely convoluted continuously changing rulings and a extreem money pit if you wanted to be competitive. Only touch used/cheap cards now, and haven't played for several years.

I have not played for several years, but the scale and exhaustive design work put into this game makes it one of the best.

The common "priciest deck wins" criticism is easily averted by playing Limited (my favourite formats). However, I am becoming a bit disillusioned by the noticeably increasing power difference across rarities.

Drafting, or casual play, is the way to go here, and the signalling and wheeling aspects beats 7 Wonders hands down.

I loved this game before it was destroyed by the sheer ammount of cards that were published (and other things). My rating doesn't values what it is now, but what it was.

It's  impossible to maintain the balance with that many cards.

I also did not like that the most powerful cards, instead of being eliminated from the game, were not published anymore (thus, becoming more rare and expensive) and declared limited (maximum 1 per deck). The existance of these cards allowed expensive mazes to be more competitive that other strategic mazes very well designed.

It was a very fun game to play with friends, but not so much at a competitive level.

RATING: 10
This one scores high points just based on the sheer number of years it dominated my life.  My collecting and deckbuilding days are over now and I will only play with either pre constructed over the counter theme decks or sealed deck construction rules, but I still think this is a brilliant game.

Update:  I just taught my wife how to play and she can't get enough of it.  While I'm still not comitted to buying boosters and collecting all over again, it looks like I'll be buying many more theme decks in the foreseeable future.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Game mechanics are brilliant! This games biggest plus/minus is the fact it's a CCG and there are too many cards to read if playing with a new deck and/or someone who hasn't played before. Nowadays I like to buy a couple of themepacks and play with them for entertaining and relatively cheap games.

I was collecting since the mid-late 90s, and have 6,000 cards or so. Since my girlfriend doesn't play, though, I really only need one varied box of cards to draft from, and maybe a few decks. The rest should be traded away, even though that's contrary to the unabashedly acquisitive nature of the game.

I used to played this game for about 18 years, and then managed to sell off cards I had originally purchased for around $6, which had become around $200 each.  Now if I still had them they would be $250-300 each, as they are absolutely crucial cards to have in any competitive deck.  So, If you have all the expendable cash in the world, and no bills to pay, then this is the game for you.  Otherwise, find yourself a cheaper game to play.

If I rated this game between 1994 and 1997, I would have given it a "10".  However, it's grown too large, the card balance is shot, and the rules are a bit overcomplicated, and have loopholes that create advantages for rules lawyers.  I still enjoy playing this game but only in draft formats.  The "Winston Cube" format, where you basically draft from a block of your favorite cards, is particularly fun for me these days.  But buy new cards?  Play in a tournament?  Nah, I'll pass.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Collectible, annoying players, never ending errata, unstable play environment.  A true black hole to throw money into with no playable return.

A couple pluses that keep it from being a "1" - Richard Garfield invented a clever design that never should have been collectible;  managed to single-handedly keep game stores from going out of business in the '90's;  may act as a gateway to other games.

*Update - I like Planechase and the duel decks.  The duel decks provide a quick MTG game experience.  They don't mix and match well, though.  Planechase is right in line with my love of some chaotic elements in game environments.

I once played Magic (4th edition's time), but then I realized the high costs required to allow any player staying competitive. Hence I dropped out of it and sold my cards.

I know many people think this game is expensive but for around the same cost of a couple of Kosmos 2 player games you can buy the 4 pre-constructed championship decks that come out every autumn.

Competitive or Team, 2-4, Strategy, TCG

Rating is for "kitchen table" MTG. I don't care too much for collectible games or competitive scenes in general, but man if it isn't fun to grab a Duel Deck pack or throw together a couple quick decks and play with friends. 

As for the rules themselves, I like the mathiness of it all, and the bluffing element eliminates determinism. Facing certain defeat but somehow overcoming by pretending that last card in your hand is a counterspell is exhilarating. 

And with the release of the first "challenge deck", Magic has hit the table again in my house. I really hope they keep releasing these.

I think this one gets high ratings because it was first.  I'm only giving it a 3 because I like some of the card art.  I played back in the '90s so that's what my comments are based on.  Weak to negligible storyline; for me I like the CCG to have a unifying theme.  In theory the simplicity of the general game engine and complexity of specific cards allowed for great flexibility, but in practice it just led to frustration.  It was no fun getting demolished by the latest killer combo, played by the guy at the table who'd spent the most money on boosters.  I bet I'd give this game a 7 or better rating if I'd only played sealed starter games.

Okay, I get it. I understand the appeal. And I don't like those kinds of games. Too heavy on skill. Not a chance if you don't know the cards.

Magic is flawed, but good. More important than that is that Magic is a common language with so many gamers. There are so many people to play with, so many different ways to play. I prefer a lot of other card games, but I play a lot of Magic because of its ubiquity.

Discovered this game in 1995.  Then played passionately for the next 8 years.  I would draft at least once a week and occasionally travel to different competitions around the country.  Spent a lot of money on this game.  I decided to stop playing because it gets wearisome trying to keep up with the constant new releases.  I sold half my collection and I have plans to sell the rest in the near future.  I was thinking of collecting the pre-constructed decks but they have been discontinued.

My brothers really got into this for awhile when we were teens.  They wasted  quite a bit of their scant money on boosters and talked my dad into buying them more any chance they could get.  I never bought anything, but this is a fun game.  We weren't into carefully constructing decks; we just got some good monsters, artifacts, land, etc. and played.  I think my brothers may have participated in a tournament once...?  Anyways, I enjoyed this game though I am never going to shell out money to play.  All of my Jr. High students are into Yu-Gi-Oh these days.  I think CCG's can teach some good logic skills...as well as greed and cheating.  Oh well.

I've got a couple boxes of my brothers' cards here now.  Who knows if we'll ever play?

Awesome game.

Pick up a few packs.  Have a draft.  Play some games.  Next time just shuffle the cards up, have a draft, and play some more.

It really doesn't have to be THAT expensive if you're playing casually.

It's too bad they don't sell the "tournament packs" anymore.  Those were perfect because they included land so you could start playing right away.

The one-and-only CCG, in my opinion. This game gets the only "10" rating I have awarded. No other CCG has come close to matching the elegance and complexity this game can deliver. The game has evolved into a cash cow with "endless" expansions.  Just when I think I have a firm handle on the game, I enter into casual game and encounter a whole new strategy and/or card combination that makes me want to go home and design a new deck. I not only love to play this CCG, but I have made enough money from card sales that I actually bought the wife a NEW CAR, had the roof repaired, bought a new hot water heater, and more! No lie. Buy by the case, build your sets and sell off the rest. I have been doing this from the start. "There are a lot of $$$'s in them thar pieces of cardboard!" The photo of the MINT Power 9 in this game listing is a small portion of the cards I have kept "for future investment"!

A would be excellent game when playing with only commons and uncommons, except for the constant risk of being helplessly mana screwed or mana flooded.

RATING: 7
Too expensive, too time consuming, but so good. I own around 8.000 magic cards (never counted them) and love this game. But for me it suffers the same problem that the abstract game Go suffers. It's not a casual gamers game so you can't bust this one out at a gaming night with non-gamer friends.

One could theoretically keep it simple & cheap by just getting a couple of premade decks but one can also end up getting addicted to magic and spend more and more money on it. However it is THE most sophisticated ccg out there. So if you're going to waste money on little pieces of paper, waste them on Magic and not any other ccg that'll be gone after a couple of years. (Then again, that means you're free again whereas Magic will hold an eternal grip on your life...)

The deckbuilding aspect of the game with so many different cards makes this game so deep that playing with or against another deck is often like playing another game. Magic is not one  game but many different games really, which is why it stands up to repeated plays so well.

You can play zombies and try to swarm your opponent with the undead. You can be the sneaky blue mage who just messes with his opponents gameplan all the time by countering (nullyfying) his spells and manipulating his cards. Your deck can be agressive and attempt to overwhelm your opponent before he can put up a reasonable defense, or you can to hinder your opponent at whatever he is doing and then just bring down some monstrous creature or unleash a huge spell and overwhelm your opponent out of nowhere.

You can also just get whacky play any mix of colors, even all five colors, which is not just possible but can also make for powerful decks with a good and big enough cardpool. The sky (and your pocket money) is the limit in this game.

Magic is a great game if you have players of roughly equal skill to play against. The learning curve is very steep and some players will learn how to play the game but never grasp the deeper strategies. There is just so much rules to digest with keywords, abilities, phases, card types, timing, zones etc. that a beginner barely has time and brainpower left to figure out what is actually a good play in any given situation.

An experienced player can easily crush an inexperienced player even with an inferior deck, which is a good thing of course, since skill should be rewarded. But Magic is not a pick up and play game, where you just have to play a couple of rounds and expect to win against a seasoned veteran, despite magic relying so much on the luck of the draw.

Infinitely replayable in a multitude of formats - your mileage may vary depending on how much money you want to spend.  That being said, there are many interesting formats such as Elder Dragon Highlander, or 2-Headed Giant that let you get the max value out of otherwise worthless cards.  You can take this game as far as you want and still be challenged.

I'm not a CCG'er and I wasn’t that impressed to tell the truth. Draw 1 card, ramp up the mana early, get out creatures as you can - all seem to be obvious plays dictated by what you draw. The game play seems to be in the combat decisions and working out the repercussions and that was fine - trading off defense now vs losing life and counter-attacking next turn. In the early game you never have enough mana. In the latter game the last thing you want is more mana cards as you can do virtually what you want, and therefore you’re dependent on what you draw.

I can see how the gameplay rewards the effort of deck construction though, so that and the combat decisions seems to be where the reward for good ‘play’ lie. Given I have no interest in deck construction though, and that the luck of the cards drawn seemed to override combat nous, I have no real urge to explore it further.

Where it was better than Doomtown and Lot5R was the obviousness of the cards (no masses of fine print on what they can do) which produced a faster game, but the downside was the simplicity led to a lack of depth.

One of the best games and definitely the best CCG ever.  Endless strategy, infinite deck customization, multiple ways to win, and so much more!  Its gotta be one of the most expanded and most popular games out there which says a lot.

Learning the game can take a long time for new players and is kind of like learning another language.  The cost to keep buying the new expansions can get expensive.

RATING: 6
One of the contemporary classics. So much fun! CCGs are not for everyone because of the time and money to build quality decks. A good game because it requires one skill to build a deck, and another skill to play it and adapt it. Great artworks! Colorful! Always fresh! Great invention by Richard Garfield.

Would much rather play a CCG with stronger theming, such as VTES, Netrunner, or MECCG.  However, per Ender, have built a cube to use to try drafting with, and had a much better time.  Gift to AI.

I have tried this game a few times and learned that it's not for me, not even as a game. I have never liked the "collecting" part of the game. I am a collector kind of person, and I collect a lot of things, but collecting cards never appealed to me not even as a child. 

With a game like this you have to buy a lot of cards to get what you want and the rest is useless. I often see players that buy an entire display for a lot of money, only to find a few useful cards and throw away the rest. 

Even if it was a LCG instead of a CCG I would never have the time and effort to keep up with all the news and to figure out good combos and build decks. This is why I hardly ever play LCG's or CCG's, even if I own a few.

Oh my old love. With as much customizable goodness to it due to my large collection no wonder my favorite game for most of my life was magic. However due to the introduction to the new mythic rarity I have been slowly escaping the money sink that is the magic CCG. Currently I have not spent a penny since rise of the eldrazi set that came out a year or two ago and I would like it to stay that way. But my EDH decks still get play with my other softcore magic friends so I'll never totally leave this beast of a game.

3 plays - I'm definitely not a serious player, with only having played a few intro games with a friend. This game was fun in it's own right and would have scored higher had it been a more 'accessible' game. This game requires money and dedication (in terms of deck building to be competitive and keeping up with new card releases), much like the culture of a tabletop miniatures game. This therefore attracts a more 'gamer' crowd how will 'gaming focus' is much more on this single game. This ultimately makes it become much less like a 'casual game'. 

The business model of this type of game is also something that I can not support either, with continual releases of new products that make previous purchases obsolete. Very reminiscent of the Games Workshop days. All of this culture and context, makes the game way less fun to play for someone who only has a casual interest in playing MTG.

Magic is fun, that's a given.  And if someone gives me a deck to play, I have no complaints.  But it's nothing short of unapproachable to newcomers.  There's too much to learn and know.  Besides sheer luck, the only way to get the cards to build a good deck is to shell out the big bucks.  I appreciate the tremendous depth and level of customization, but it's a big investment for one game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This is not a very popular opinion, but there comes a point where there is too much game to be had. MTG is at that point. Too many cards; no rules on deckbuilding; no parameters. Some find that liberating, I find it to be the very core of analysis paralysis.

First of all, I refuse to play Constructed Magic; it's pay-to-win, and the amount of money necessary would buy me a lot of other entire games rather than just four copies of a piece of cardboard.

That said, mechanically Magic is fairly interesting.  The mana curve is tedious and often controls the outcome of the game more than actual deckbuilding, which is depressing, hence the 7.  But playing the game with prebuilt decks (either Duel Decks or intro packs) is "boardgame-y" enough to be interesting.  It's still not a /great/ game, but it's good, and I'll play it.

My girlfriend and I play Magic very casually. We have 3 half-decks of each colour, and we just randomly mash up two half-decks each and play a round or two. 

This is actually what I like most about Magic. Sure, you can be intensely competitive and spend hundreds of dollars a year crafting the best decks. But you can also spend $35 on a Deckbuilder's Toolkit box, and be perfectly happy to play casual games for months or even years.

So, I'm happy to say that I'm no longer a flat-crackhead.

The game is good and there's a strong following to it. My only problem is so many cards come out so quickly that it's hard to keep track. Once you finally get a deck you really like, tuned to your liking and all, the cards are illigal to play. (Think Type 2 format.) I play the game and enjoy it, but there are some drawbacks to it.

Genius game with so many possibilities. Played excessively in '94-'97, then stopped due to not having time and money to keep up with the expansions. 

In August 2010, found the game again by reading about the cube drafting! It's been a huge blast to play. We have a group of players that used to play in the 90's and I have built a nostalgic cube from that time period (4th edition - Urza's Destiny). 

I doubt I will ever buy a booster again, cube drafting is the way to go.

RATING: 7
More depth than any other game, ever. The only thing keeping it from being a 10 in my book is the massive financial investment it calls for.

Update: Reactionary game filled with playing cards and hoping your opponent doesn't have counterspells. I somehow never noticed this before, but card design is largely uninspired, with only a few cards from each set that really stand out.

Other LCGs (Netrunner) and pseudo LCGS (Summoner Wars) have shown this game in an unfavorable backlight.

EDIT: Going back and playing this... man, having to fill your deck with land is boring. The mana struggle also makes dual lands so indispensable that they are just auto-includes. I don't want auto-includes, I want to put what I want in there.

This is one of the best games (with Chess) that I have ever played. And I have played some games of MtG over quite some years, even won some of them :) It is truly an art and the pro touring/GP/old nationals/regionals system is/was a lot of good fun. I strongly recommend this and encourage anybody interested in real serious gaming to check it out. And of course the true test is limited format, which is an excellent test of playing skills, no explanations, just play it. The feeling of winning with bad cards is just unbeatable. So I enjoy playing with bad cards a lot, winning with good cards is so elementary :)

For constructed play, this game is a victim of its own popularity.  It's reached the point where it's not possible to do well without going online and reading about other people's strategies (and copying whatever you have the cards for).

For drafting, I feel like I should enjoy this more, but I don't.  Possibly the problem is that too many M:TG players are hypercompetitive assholes?  Possibly it's just that I am bad at the game.

This game is too much of a money sink.  It is best played when someone has setup some form of a draft, whether it be from a personal "base pool" of cards, or purchasing and playing a draft of a new set.  As a cube draft, I give this game a 8.  Otherwise, a 5.

Only problem with it: it's a ccg. Played it for 5 years (with a break of 8 years in between). It's just too freakin' expensive. My legacy deck (cheap one) is going for 500+ euros and it can go up to 1500 or more. Too bad it's such a fun competitive game.

The old daddy of TCGs still reigns supreme. This is a fantastic game in that it's not all that expensive to get started (i bought my starter deck by the pound at my local comic book shop), however, if you really want to you can spend pretty much an infinite amount of money on getting your deck just right.

Strategy-wise, this is pretty much as good as it gets, there is a random element to it but in the end, you decide just what that random element is going to look like.

Excellent game, would have bought cards if they were obtainable the orthodox way - buy them as complete packs. There is no way I'd feed one cent into that fleecing "collectible" scheme.

Obvious barrier to entry here but the deckbuilding potential is very deep.  Commander is really fun. Despite endless little rules I still recommend it.  With the massive card pool the game's like a mechano set for me with the deck building options. Responsibility is on the game group or player to build decks that are fun to play against eachother though. Lots of effort and work needs to be invested in the game but I'd say it pays off if the universe interests you. sleeved

I haven't played Magic in a few years. I gave away most of my cards to a friends daughter who was really into the game. I loved the game in the late 90's, but started to get tired of the each expansion trying to "out power" the one before it.

When MTG first came out, I wasn't at all keen on it because of the basic concept - "spend lots of money buying cards from us so that you can eventually have a decent deck of cards".  After a while a couple of mates whose opinions I usually trust suggested (independently) that it wasn't actually a bad game in itself and that they thought I'd like it.
So I tried it, keeping as open mind about it as I could.  And although I tried, I really didn't like the game itself either...

Even though I am out of the collection I still have a love for the game.  Wish I still played it once in a while.

It's been perhaps five years since I've played this seriously, and I shudder to think how much I've spent on cards back in the day, but still...

The game design is just masterful.  Every play feels different.  Every opponent felt different.  I loved planning decks.  I loved seeing how different decks went up against each other.  My rating is probably biased, but frankly, I don't care.  Magic was a big part of why I love games.

Magic.

Oh crap, I knew I shouldn't have got involved.

Now I own a lot of cards and have made all kinds of decks.  I was introduced to it very recently through a boardgame group that I meet with from time to time.  It was all easy fun at first, but I went out and bought cards and ended up playing with a good friend of mine many times.

If anything, I am really glad that I never got into this stuff when I was a teenager.  I would have spent all of my money on this game!  I've got enough cards now and the play has slowed down so I doubt I'll buy more, but it's a very enjoyable game to play for me.  Lots of great moves that I can appreciate both when I play them and when my opponent plays them against me.

I still think 'The Spoils' is a better game, though.  However - for a quick equivalent this hits the spot.

Haven't played in ages, but it is certainly a seminal game. My wife and I used to play endlessly (back in early to mid 90s) and enjoyed it a great deal. I'm not a huge fan of the general idea of the CCG, simply because it becomes a breathless and bank account-draining race to complete your collection and stay competitive with the latest and greatest. That said, it is a hugely entertaining game that does pose tactical and strategic challenges. Hmmm. Writing about it makes me think I should probably break out those old cards...

Shame about the collectible elements as this is a fantastic card game that really is worth trying.

Despite owning a complete collection of the Blue Moon card game (the closest thing to this that I'm aware of), there's just something about Magic that makes it more appealing. And the size of the cards in Blue Moon is an annoyance.

My suggestion if you're interest in playing this casually with friends - pick a set & acquire one of each intro deck. Play with those to learn the game and see if you like it. Then, to allow you to get into deck building, look to buy a bulk collection of commons & uncommons from the same set from eBay or similar. Then DO NOT get any more cards. There simply is no way you can own every card ever printed, nor any need to.

Don't worry about acquiring a complete set, don't chase down rares, don't think about constructing really powerful decks.

With a few hundred cards you'll have enough to be able to randomly deal out some commons & uncommons and build decks to play against each other with those. You may need to pick up a few extra land cards to allow this, but they're very inexpensive. You'll get to try out all kinds of combinations and never see the same deck twice.


OWN: All 5 x Magic 2010 Core Intro Packs, plus a number of boosters and inidivual card purchases (land cards & common/uncommon cards) from the same set.

NOTE: This makes for a (relatively!) modest yet varied collection with lots of commons & uncommons, a fair selection of rares for spice, and enough land cards to allow 2 people to play "limited" format against each other with artificial "booster packs" dealt from the collection.

REMINDER: DON'T NEED ANY MORE!

My wife got into this game for a while, so I bought her several starter decks and packs.  It's a neat game, and I like how much is out there to collect.  The various artists make each card great to look at.  There is so much history to the game that it is hard to jump into.  I also don't like how easy it is to make unbeatable decks.  It's also frustrating that it's so popular that most game shops do magic nights and if you don't play that game you're out of luck (sorry LOTR players).  I guess I'm just hatin'.  If it's your game, I say go for it.  It's just not mine.

The classic CCG. It's amazing on how many levels this is enjoyed. Play it casually with your elves versus your friend's goblin deck, do a draft whenever a new set comes out, or go to tournaments and write game theory articles on magic on the net. Or design your own cards, and invent your own formats. Or just collect the cards, and trade. Amazing game.

I've tried 3 or 4 times to get into this game. I can understand it's appeal as the numerous tactical combinations are an interesting puzzle, but the text reading slows play. To make any informed decision requires knowledge of not only your deck but also your opponent's which is impossible, unless you want to spend time learning the 100's of cards out in circulation. But it's the attitude of the game that I can't get into. It is the equivalent of boxing. Yes it may be dramatic at times, but the the player spending the most time building a brutal deck will emerge the victor. Even the promotion of the game has other hair raising similarities to boxing.

Magic is amazing amounts of fun every time I play it.  The strategy is so complex that even advanced players will occasionally make mistakes but simple enough that new players can enjoy themselves.  The game is always changing with fun new mechanics and cards that keep things fresh every couple of months.  

I play booster drafts which cost about $16 for an evening of fun and then I sell my cards and prizes recouping much of the expense.  This recurring expense is more expensive than normal board games but much cheaper than trying to keep up with the constructed metagame.

Playing in tournaments at my local game store is also a really social experience that puts me in contact with people I never would have met otherwise and led to me meeting most of my best friends.

[floatleft][ImageID=821612][/floatleft]I stopped playing M:tG after high school in 2002 during the Odyssey block. I still have my old decks. I love Magic. M:tG is insanely addictive with massive replayability potential. I didn't stop playing because of lack of interest, Magic just fell to the way-side. Now getting back into Magic seems like a daunting task and none of my close gaming comrades play actively. I miss playing Magic. I recently looked at some of the new cards and I was impressed with what they have done with the game.

Played this pretty intensely for a couple of months in early 2012 when I was just getting sucked into board games in a serious way. Jason used to play back in the 90s with his uncle. He thought it would be fun to teach me. It was! We had a lot of fun, especially early on. I remember in particular playing one card that was "destroy all creatures every where". That was a blast!! Jason never saw it coming. Spent silly amounts of money ordering singles and rares. Nothing like what tends to be spent on MTG. I never logged any of those multitudes of plays. Jason went off the deep end and constructed this insane deck and the game just lost it's fun after that. Now we'll play the pre-constructed decks every once in a while because they are more balanced. Under those conditions, it is still fun to play. My beefs are with the type of player my husband becomes playing this game--way too serious. Aside from this, really love the artwork too.

RATING: 10
A real-total-absurd money-drain. But also a real monster-game, an entire universe by its own.
For me more a collection than a game: I love the incredible artwork and I have all sets edited in Italy (in italian language), since the old first italian 'black bordered' 4th Edition, plus Antiquities and Fallen Empires (~60.000 cards in total, counting doubles... and yes, I'm not normal).

The game is great, original and clever: tactics, combos and deck building possibilities are endless... Best card-game ever for me and one of the best games I played in my life, also if the last sets are very different (and worst) from what Magic was in the beginning; now the game is more abstract & 'math' and less thematic.
But the great, real problem with Magic is that now it is more a business than a game. A real pity, 'cause the game is really great, perhaps too great and it just pays the price of his success, like many things in life...

It seems every couple of years, I'm pulled back in by some new mechanics and wonder why I ever left... only to remember the massive cost of keeping current with expansions that are released every two or three months.

An awesome game: brilliant and extremely simple idea, fantastic artwork, deep as the best abstracts (the system is based on probabilities), plays very quick and is so much fun.
It was a milestone in the gaming history and has clearly influenced many other newer games.
Don't be afraid of its business aspect. Yes, it holds the gaming world record number of expansions, but you don't need to get them all or buy any expensive cards to enjoy it.
We've been playing it for 15 years without investing tons of time or money on it.
We have around 800 cards now (almost all of them commons and uncommons) and lately we always play a house variant of cube drafting.
And sure we will keep playing it for a long time to come.

The only thing keeping this from being a 10 is the rules complexity, but that's somewhat unavoidable given the incalculable number of possible card interactions. A lot of people hate this game because of its price structure, which is one of the worst in gaming, but the game itself is strategic and amazing.

EDIT: If you are looking to get into Magic: the Gathering, but daunted by its price, THIS is the hands-down #1 way to do it: Go to ebay and find an auction for "4x common/uncommon set" of a set that starts with M and ends with a number ("M12", "M13", "M14", etc.) These can be found on ebay for under $20 (shipping included) if you're patient. Then buy 25-30 of each basic land (or go beg/borrow/steal them from your friends/local store) and you don't need to purchase another card in your life. Just make a bunch of decks and play a bunch of matches using only these cards. The strategy is WAY deeper than it appears on the surface. If you have Magic-playing friends, invite them over to play with you using your cards only; they'll probably grumble about how boring and basic your cards are, but I GUARANTEE they'll have a good time, even if they don't expect to. This is a great way to get a taste of the game without overwhelming yourself or your wallet.

Double edit: Use the above method to teach new players how to play, creating specially constructed (balanced) decks to use for the first few matches. It will reinvigorate your love of the game.

RATING: 8
Just about everyone knows about this game, so there's not much I can say about, really.
Since you can put your deck together yourself, there's no telling what your opponent may be up to, and that might be the most fun involved in this game.
The downside is they, what, release 4 new versions a year? So you can spend a veritable fortune on a virtually limitless amount of cards...

RATING: 8.4
Instant CCG classic. Great mechanics and an insane amount of combinations. The game itself is coming from a different era though - I don't think CCG games are that popular these days. Great thing for collectioners though, as the artwork and lore text is simply amazing.

As pretty much all CCG, it's created mostly just for tournament purposes. It's very hard to play casually with friends, if they don't have their own deck. I know that there are lots of tournament rules, some funky drafts, etc. etc., but it all feels like an awkward and lousy attempt to fix an unfixable problem. 

The solution, though, is to play an iOS version (also online multiplayer), which has limited and finite amount of decks - so you can configure and play the deck, decks are thematically arranged (denial, dmg, direct spells, etc), so you get the chance to taste all the different flavors and pick the one you enjoy the most.

RATING: 9
A rating of 9 only for casual players and fun play, since Type II turned the game into a blatant re-cycling money-making sinkhole of power creep for profit's sake.
But as a expandable, customizable card game it is an incredible accomplishment that revolutionized gaming. The deck-building aspect is a vital gaming concept, not to be dismissed or overlooked.
I got in right at the tailend of Unlimited, and got out after Homelands, though picked up a smattering of Weatherlight, Mirage, etc.
Still have quite a few classic old cards - no Mox/Lotus or Ancestral Recall, but most others (dual-lands, Time Walk, Time Twisters, Mirror Universes, Gauntlet of Might, Juzam Djinns, etc)

Have recently started playing the XBox Duels of the Planeswalkers game, and taught my son. We play casually, I've caught up on most of the casual cards in the 12 years I took off, and have played in a couple pre-release tourneys.

Got out of this CCG After the Urza's block of expansions.  It has a good tournament format and expansion + base set growth cycle.  Depending on what is tourney legal at the time, the powerful synergistic card combinations make fourth turn wins too easy, and I refuse to pay money to collect cards to play a game with 14 year olds which is easier to win than Gin, and more draw dependent.

Colors Rated Favorite to Least: 1 Black, 2 Blue, 3 White, 4 Green, 5 Red.

I've been playing and collecting on and off again for more than 20 years (4th Ed). This was the game that captured my imagination, helped me understand the psychology of the meta game, and catalyzed my interest in game mechanisms.

My disinterest in tournaments means: (1) I'm saddened by the power creep over the last decade. (2) Single card combos are way too common and bring down average player IQ. (3) I refuse to play with/vs decks with Planeswalker cards because they require watering down a deck to use/counter them, yet provide no improvement to a skilled victory.

Ambivalent about this one. A 2 player, 20 min game is fun enough, but I can't help think gameplay plays a far second to the novelty of trying out new decks and cards. I'll play, but won't buy.

Magic does have the dubious honour of being the single most awful gaming session experiences ever - a six player "Commander" game that went for two hours before we split into 2 x 3. I couldn't be bothered looking at ANY of my opponent's cards. Completely chaotic. Ended with a player coming last taking over all our creatures with one spell and turning them against us. Pointless.

I always give it a shot once per year or so. It's fun for one round or two, then I remember why I stopped playing in the first place: too much luck involved (and the guy that invested most money in it recently usually wins, since newer expansions are always unbalanced compared to older ones*).

I was a late comer to MTG and was skeptical when my brother-in-law first asked me to try it out, but I came to really love it.  Unfortunately it wore thin on me fairly quickly, as the constant investment in cards got to be a little much.  We also found that it came down to who had the most money to spend on a deck would be the winner.

If you're new and just getting into this, it's a great game, but I would get some friends, have a draft and play that way.  It makes it a much more accessible and affordable experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
portable and extremely varied game, rules can be intimidating and land screw can be frustrating

EDIT:

So I'm playing this a lot more and I think it's the game I'm obsessed with the most. The gameplay is alright, but the real joy of the game is deckbuilding. If you are creative and like to design things, this can be a game for you. I like trying new and innovative things.

The bad part about the game is that to get certain cards, the cost is really, really high. I mean $20 for a single card? There's cards that are worth tons more than that as well.

Even with that drawback, I want to be clear that it's really about what format you play more than anything. If you play tournament level, prepare to shell out some cash. If you play casual like me and 99% of the other Magic players out there, you don't have to spend that much to do okay.

The depth of deckbuilding is only matched by the amount of game analysis that there is. There are terms like tempo, midrange and boardwipe to remember. You have mana dorks, bombs and removal. There are a ton of card types and the interaction from all the cards is interesting.

I like the game because of the game analysis it has and has had for decades. It's also very nice that it has a huge player base, so you don't have to worry about not finding players, which is actually the case with 99% of my other games I have. The rules are quite a bit to swallow at first, but then become second nature. Also, the nature of it being random means that at times you'll have crap draws where you'll draw all lands or no lands. But despite all of this, it's a landmark game that is one of the top. If you don't like it, at least know of it.

RATING: 5
Urgh.  This is my brother's favorite game.  Since he is my main gaming partner, I hear a lot of "let's play magic."  Of course, he hears a lot of "I don't want to.  Let's get root canals instead."

There are too many small rules that I don't know that I need to know in order be competitive at MtG.  I have to have memorized a whole deck of cards and know the nuances of hundreds of cards (both mine and my opponents) and I just don't care to invest that much time and energy into the game.

As much as MtG is expensive in terms of money investment, it is also expensive in terms of time investment.  One must study the available cards, sift through dozens of booster packs, and create optimum decks from rares bought while staring into glass cases.  MtG is a lifestyle and it is not a lifestyle choice that I want to make.

That being said, I do understand that it's a game that has a lot to offer.  There are many choices for a player who would like to spend the time to create card combinations that are inventive and hard to combat.  I can understand why a person would love MtG--that person just isn't going to be me.

I'm the proud owner of a Space the Convergence cube. Google it and bask in the awesomeness of this fan retheme. If you're in the area and want to check it out, let me know. Beyond that I also have various other "specialized" cubes including the Custom Cube Project v1.0, a Split Card Common/Uncommon Cube, and a fully proxied powered cube. 

For standard/real cards I have an unpowered "typical" cube, a copy of Adam Styborski's Pauper cube, RTR block Peasant 6 man cube, and a "Let's Learn Magic and/or Drafting" cube for new players. If you can't tell, drafting is my favorite way to play Magic.

I also enjoy Modern. My main deck is UW Tron, though I have a nice modern collection that allows me to create most non GBx based decks (missing Tarmogoyfs and Bob's).

Started playing this around the time of Revised. Given my extremely limited income at the time (I was a Freshman in HS), I managed to amass a respectable set, at least amongst my friends. Lots of great memories of playing this game at my parents house with 5-10 friends in massive free-for-all style games.

Would have originally ranked this game much higher in previous years.  Nowadays, the deck building is more of a chore than something to do for fun.

I think it is a lot of fun to buy things because they keep local game stores in existence. I also like breaking into a new box or packet. The strategy of this game is a slightly expanded version of rock-paper-scissors. I personally believe that no one will ever surpass the fun potential and interest of a 52-card poker deck. When you buy Magic, you are committing a lot of money for a game that can only be played one way in a specific manner at a specific event. The single deck packages that are sold at Friday Night Magic events are filled with low-powered cards that rarely even include a planes walker card. This means you will either have to spend more money on an individual rare card or buy a deck-builder set for even more money. I do love the Magic novels and have helped me understand the game better but they are just advertising. I would not say that this game is "broken." I just don't have room anymore and it is more expensive than I can manage

The game play is often pretty good but I give it a 3 for two reasons.  The game is usually won by those who spent the most money which I find offensive.  Second I wrote to Wizards of the Coast about a damaged box of cards, and got the run around & then insults in return.
Game un-arguably has some good points, (fast, can bring a deck just about anywhere, some decks / strategies are very subtle).  It has some problems (the ever growing list of broken cards, very complicated rules & entire sets filled with almost useless cards).  I would give it a 5 but WotC has pissed me off.

Magic was an obsession for me at one point - but thankfully I slowly stopped playing it and ignored it for a while.

Fast forward to when I discovered Cube Drafting.  This is a great format that make Magic into a stand alone game and one that I'm looking forward to playing from time to time.

I love this game.  But, it's really expensive.  I would love playing it again.  But, I have two choices of player groups to play with.  The ones that would play in tournament or the ones that don't want to make their own decks. 

So, we'll probably never play this again.

Started off with a large box of common cards given to me by an avid collector with oodles of spare commons.

I have learned to avoid "investing" in Collectable games. It costs too much in proportion to the enjoyment that you get from playing the game. It's a shame because the game mechanism is not that bad.

RATING: 6
In terms of the pure game, it is very good. In terms of mix and balance of the cards, it is also very good. I came for the good art, and stayed for the game.

I left for two reasons: One, some articles in Duellist which explained the finer points of the rules. However, they were basically rewriting the rules in those articles, as they went off into things that you would NEVER infer from the book that comes with a deck. Two, Fourth Edition. Correcting problems in Alpha and Beta in the Revised Edition was fine, Fourth made it obvious that they were just going to trade 'official' cards out as often as they could get away with to force continual repurchasing of basic supplies.

Pity, too. The main game is quite good.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
I find that the requirements for what makes a good game experience when playing most games are very strict.  A good game of chess, for example, requires exactly one other player, who must be of roughly similar level and willingness to think.  Magic is great in that it is not only an incredibly deep game with some of the most intricate strategy around, which accommodates those who like a lot of time to consider their actions (via the deckbuilding aspect) and those who play quickly, but it is also very flexible.  2, 3 (less so), 4, 5, and 6-player games all have excellent variants available, and the level of difficulty of the decks can be scaled to the players.  The existence of limited events, like sealed deck and booster draft options, makes high-level play available to someone who owns no cards, and only wants to spend $12.  Combine all that with greater ease finding players than any other game affords, and you have a real treat.  Magic isn't the jigsaw of my gaming toolset, but a whole toolkit with wide applicability.

Lowering my rating from an 8 to a 5 to reflect my willingness to play. Trying to stop playing Magic to focus on other interests and to save money. Don't get me wrong - great game, but it's a game that rewards obsessiveness and I don't need another obsession.

Used to enjoy this game.  But, after playing several other CCGs, I find this one is a bit long in the tooth and now you need the Bar equivalent to play with all the rulings.  It's nothing more than a "Keeping Up with the Joneses" game.

Great card game, requires some rules but most are explained on the cards. Biggest downfall are 2 things; the theme is always the same (except the comedy packs) and hasn't changed too much. If you buy a few decks you should be good for the most part. You can find decent deals on eBay for buying a collection all at once. Competitive it's a little different, certain cards are staples and you need to shell out money for them but if you play casually with friends it's not too bad.

8-15-14: Picked up heroes vs. monsters duel decks.  Having a lot of fun with kids.

Collected cards back in the mid to late 90's.  Gave it up since I was spending way to much cash for it.  The game became who could spend the most amount of money to create their decks.  People were spending hundreds of dollars to have mox jems & a black lotus in their deck.  Yes it is fun to play, but lacks in the bang for your buck category.  Unfortunately I gave away all my cards after I got married...wish I still had them now so I could sell them.  I'd spend the money on other games.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game I have played the longest.  Overall, it is an incredible game.  However, you must be conscious of the amount of money you are spending on the game as well as the perceived value of the cards you purchase over time (they fluctuate).  If you do not care about the money aspect of the game, it is a perfect game.

Many people thoroughly enjoy constructed Magic, though I find Limited (Drafting) to be much more fun and challenging.  Nowadays, I only play Cube, which I believe is the highest form of the game :)

Magic can be fun, if you can afford it. While there's a lot of variety to be seen in play styles among players, it always seems like the best strategy is simply to spend more money, and the constant cycle of new and obsolete cards ensure you won't stop anytime soon in you get into it.

It can be a great game if you can keep up, and the card art is always breathtaking, but be prepared to sink a lot of money into this hobby.

RATING: 6.5
I played MTG for 6 months in 1999, but there was no one else to play with in my hick home town, so I gave up playing, though I kept collecting (mostly rare cards) for a few years.

I had all of Unglued, because I purchased boosters when it first came out, lol. Also I had all of the Vanguard cards, the big ones, from their first printing. 

My entire collection was lost in a bad event in 2001. There were a lot of Alpha and Beta cards, moxes, even a black lotus. The collection was huge, with total worth at between 3 and 5 thousand dollars, then.

I began playing MTG again from about 2005 to about 2010, with some friends from the Double Eagle.

It was a fun time and I loved building and testing new deck ideas more than anything.

I stopped playing MTG. Once I got into playing board and card games, MTG seemed like a bad investment. Here is why:

1) You have to keep buying new cards to keep your decks at a competitive level even for casual play. This is because the newer cards have better mechanics, more synergy, and compared to older cards are over-powered.

2) MTG is really only playable, even casually, by MTG players. It is not much fun to teach new ppl, and they rarely want to learn.

1+2=3) MTG is a bad investment. For the money put into it, and the time put into it, I could be buying new board games and card games that EVERYONE can play and that will be playable for the REST OF OUR LIVES!

So I stopped, though I will say: MTG was a great game.

I do not like this game. I don't like how there are thousands of cards. And how to be competitive with other players you need to at least know what every single card does, otherwise you are at a disadvantage. I also hate the collectible part. Your options are spend truck loads of money to get all the cards from a particular set or wait and pay someone else who has already done that. It's the Scientology of card games. At least with Dominion you have access to all the cards for a particular set with your single purchase. It was more fun where there were fewer cards and the rules didn't change every year.

A fine game as originally published, until Wizards decided to tweak it.  I do not play those infernal new rules (such as &quot;the stack&quot;, and get quite annoyed at &quot;Scrye&quot; and &quot;Inquest Gamer&quot; for their elitist reviews of new expansions.  It seems that if a really fun card (Chaos Orb), a really good card (Mox Diamond, etc), or combination thereof is printed, they are labeled &quot;broken&quot; and pooh-poohed as being less than acceptable to &quot;real&quot; players.  Well, I&#039;ve been a real player since Nov. &#039;93, and I STILL play for ante.  That&#039;s the way the game was meant to be played.

Groundbreaking game.  Also a bankbreaking game.  I liked this game a lot for a few years, but I don't expect I'll ever play much again.  The trouble now is I'm so far behind in knowing the cards, I'd have to start over, and there are so many cards to collect, I wouldn't want to spend the time or money.  My Type 1 deck is useless these days.

I'd rate this game much higher if I were actually willing to play it.

I wrote a review about it. This is a very cool game. It gets played everywhere, easy to learn, usually fast playing time but still deep. There is a pay to play cost - not to be confused with "pay to win" because there is no amount of money that will buy you a win in a tournament. But, with so many formats including casual, an interested player is bound to find one that fits the intended budget. Casual Magic can be dirt cheap.

I'd rate this a 9 or 10 even though I no longer own any cards.  It is unmatched by any game I've ever played - revolutionary, impactful and fun.

It's a totally inelegant system.  But that inelegant system allows for an unparalleled level of design space.  Because of that, and the age of the game, it's clearly at least a 9.

I bought my first game with my cards. I started this when it was in beta and ended my serious Magic career at Fallen Empires. I sold my cards and bought a brand new car. I got back into it at Ice Age and decided it just wasn't as fun anymore since I had given up most of my awesome cards. I rarely play this and it is all good as I hate the idea of purchasing the endless sea of card board crack. You can't deny how impactful and solid this game was though.

RATING: 4.9
I played this, and played this, and played this 10 years before I discovered Eurogames. I don't ever feel the urge to play anymore, even though I still own quite a few cards and decks. When discussing Magic, there are multiple paths to go down.  

First is the deckbuilding aspect of it. Some of my favorite memories of this game are of creating a deck, testing it, tuning it, testing it again and refining it some more. Finding just the right mix of cards and combos was extremely enjoyable.

The second thing to discuss is the actual gameplay. The thing to understand about Magic is that the rules are really there to create a basic framework to support a wide variety of different game styles and approaches, but that framework is actually pretty simple. Simple isn't necessarily bad, but there isn't a whole lot there to recommend it over other games and there are some issues with it that are quite annoying to deal with. These include issues like land-based resources, summoning sickness, paying all resources up front, card timing issues, etc... You can see a lot of more modern games which pull ideas from Magic come up with ways around these annoyances (thinking specifically of Battletech, World of Warcraft, and even Decipher's Star Wars had a much more elegant resource system), and most work better as games for it. Most of the interesting elements to this game are the way that different cards play off of each other. Gameplay is largely determined by the way a particular deck is built. Thus, the quality of gameplay really varies depending on your ability to build a good deck, or the ability to go buy the cards for the current best decks on the internet. Building good decks CAN make this a pretty engaging game. 

Finally, you have to address the collectible nature of the game. As with many CCG's this is an extremely expensive game if you want to play well. There are other game systems that are self contained that play so much better than the lowest common denominator of Magic, and are substantially cheaper, too. Magic is a strangely addictive experience, but most of the attraction is finding the right combo of cards to make a deck play well. To get to that point, you may as well play a complete game that already plays well out of the box.

To me the most compelling parts of this game are collecting and deckbuilding. Since I don't do anything with those now, I'm left with just playing the decks of Magic I still own. Using BGG's recommended ratings, that leaves me right between a 4 and a 5, closer to a 5. Not a terrible game, but when stripped of the CCG-ness, it's less compelling than most of the games on my shelf, including several dead CCG's.

Scattered much older cards such as third edition and Ice Age, but in general have lost those.

Currently playing with "Rise of Eldrazi" and whatever the two other recent packs are. The synergy in these new sets seems ridiculous. I'm very glad to be doing various drafts and sealed packs only; constructed sets are uninteresting and just a money sink.

 - Also, just now tried a "Two headed giant" 2v2 game. That was a fun way to add some spice to otherwise played out permutations of some drafted decks we had.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
good game despite being a ccg.

They only have a good idea every 2-3 years, but put out 4-ish expansions per year, so the hit rate is rather low.  But taken in aggregate there is a lot of good content there.

The biggest issue is the number of games that are won/lost by mana draws being too low/high.  I thus greatly prefer sets with guild mana and suspend, both of which serve to smooth out randomness of mana costs as well as making for actual choices during gameplay.

Ugh. Uber combo stupidity. Turn 3 kills. Ridiculous rare chasing. A player base that seems more prone to sharking, cheating, and doing business than actually playing a game. Not to mention stealing cards (but that's not a game flaw, per se). 

All the strategy seems to be in building decks. Once done, it's a race of "who gets their game out first". There is a right way to play, once you've designed a deck. Epitomizes all of the faults of CCGs with none of the benefits. Again, ugh.

I started playing around the era of Fallen Empires and Ice Age, and then tapered off during the Mirage block.  Odyssey brought me back to the fold with the graveyeard recursion theme.  I don't actually get to play much anymore, but I still love this game.  
Update 1/2011:  I don't really play anymore at all, but this game is an amazing classic and will always be a 10 for me. 
Update 7/2015:  Although I find myself down-rating some games that I don't play anymore (like Heroscape), I still think this is an all-time 10 rating.

As a casual player, the quick gameplay and dynamic interactions keeps things interesting, but the more competitive the decks get, the more boring the whole idea of arms race gets. Until recently (2009), I've starter to play sealed limited games with friends. We use the two-headed-giant and emperor magic -variants depending on how many players we can mobilize. For that, I've increased the rating to 8.

I think Magic was 10 rating for me before I started playing other board games with card interactions, but Magic still holds a special place in my heart as my first real TCG.
The only thing about Magic stopping me from keeping up with it is the money investment involved in it, as well as not having a group that will play it continually. After all, what's the point in spending cash on it if no one plays it with you? Plus the competitive scene is a bit intimidating for me, who's used to playing in casual settings.
Magic is still a good game though, and I will play it if someone wants to no problem.

This game is very good, I will give it that, but as for me, I stopped playing it after a few expansions came out in half a year and I realised this is nothing more than a waste of money, because if you don't buy enough boosters and don't get new cards, other players who do will beat you in time.

In the mid thru late 90s and early 2000s we played this game almost to the exclusion of everything else. I spent far too much time and money on MtG. It was an obsession for a while but great fun, so all is good. Since then I've given away most of my card collection, keeping just a few of my favorite decks. I've played this game hundreds of times, and spent hundreds of hours reading about the game and designing decks, but I'll only record the recent plays here.

Pros:
- So many options for deck construction
- Lots of different strategies
- Lots of different formats to play
- Pre-built decks available for people who do not what to/know how to build their own

Cons:
- The more money you pay, the better the cards you can get.  You cannot play tournament and hope to win if you do not invest in expensive cards.
- You have to keep up to date with cards constantly to play in some formats.

RATING: 6
I have to rate MtG this high just based on the great memories I have of buying new packs of cards back in 1993 and designing new decks.  However, the various limitations in the mechanics of the game (decision-less playing a land every turn, summoning sickness, player elimination, lack of comeback potential) just makes it a much worse game than some other CCG's, primarily Shadowfist, which I rate a 10. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I had a great time playing this ten plus years ago. The game was much simpler then, and had considerably less cards to deal with (which I believe made the game much better).

[b]Unique Component[/b] - No unique components.  This is strictly a card game.

[b]Quick Thoughts[/b] - I do like the game.  It is fun to play.  But this game became a pure money hog extremely quickly.  Anymore it is not worth the price to play.




I'm an old school player.  I stopped just after Ice Age.  The new cards bother me so I don't really play anymore.  I like to play in drafts though.

I'll stop at 10 because 11 is unavailable.  I don't even play much anymore due to the siren call of this game drawing me back into overspending, obsessive deckbuilding and competitive play.  So yeah, best ever, but also most dangerous for me personally.

RATING: 9
Started playing in 1994 or '95, then stopped in 1997 and recently (2007) started again.  I enjoy creating decks from various cards and playing.  I don't like when people engineer decks and buy exactly what they need... I prefer the element of chance and the limitations of what cards are available.  Adds a level of creativity to creating decks and levels the playing field, so I prefer to play in draft tournaments.  The major drawback is the necessity to buy new cards, and the fact that new sets are created and old ones cycled out prevents most players from using old cards, though it does add some nice variety - it can get expensive.

The influence of this game is profound. But perhaps, because I came at it backwards--learning Netrunner first, and then Magic--I find the latter to suffer badly by comparison. 

Magic, like many other games I don't care for, is a Tug-of-War. Netrunner is Hide-and-Seek. That difference is EVERYTHING.

Fast playing game, but one in three games is a dud due to lack of lands required for reasonably playability (or occasionally a land flood).

I love the sealed deck tournaments, though!

If I was grading by its influence on board gaming this would be a 10. But by my enjoyment it's lower. Buildup can be slow and "taking a mulligan" doesn't always solve bad first hands, which can be killer. So much of MTG seems to be decided by and focused on the meta-game and I don't find that appealing. If you love that aspect (tourneys, building decks, discussing card strength etc) then there's few rivals to this game.

Leaving aside the financial side of things, Magic is a brilliant piece of design that showcases the power of combinatorial effects in games.  There are two strikes against it, though:  1) the rules are vast and sometimes arcane. 2) It's hard, in practice, to leave aside the financial side of things.

A clever, very replayable game that I can enjoy with my friends whenever we have the time.

I have a few decks of Magic: the Gathering and I have to say that it is an enjoyable game. The only problem about it is that people who play M:tG are usually "geeks", who threat this collectable card game as a big part of their lives. They have great decks that can barely be defeated and usually keep telling me that I don't know how to play and I'm not worthy to get any card in my hands. I know I shouldn't rate any game like that, but it's a part of it, too.

Oh boy, here we go. This is one of the first games I ever got into and it pains me to this day how much money I spent (and could spend even now) on this game. Like a High School love that I still wanna take on a date, but has expensive taste and I know it would turn into a long term commitment I'd eventually break off again anyway.

Visual Appeal: (4)
The cards look great. With every new set that comes out, I am amazed by the coherence and creativity that goes into the original artwork. Cards are neatly organized and they set and industry standard for dueling card game layouts and zones. All of it works very nicely. I only wish there was more full-card art.

Components: (4)
Cards are fine. Most people sleeve them for play anyway. What about packaging? The game has gone through a lot of revisions on packaging. I think the intro deck format is fairly solid. I still think I like the theme decks from Invasion block and surrounding times better, but that might just be nostalgia talking. When I was a kid (read: pre-having-money-to-buy-cards-regularly) I was happy with a theme deck vs. theme deck battle. It is a CCG's business to be packaged in exclusive ways, and I understand that. I just wish you could go to a FNM constructed event and stand a snowball's chance without spending $100+.

This game has influenced so much that has come after, and I think the best contribution was the 5 color balanced spectrum. It might be the most balanced example of asymmetry in any game that exists. It was a theme that begged you to choose sides, have a favorite, or even create your own deck personality. New mythologies are created every few sets with new mechanisms and characters to go with it. It seems like they won't run short on ideas very soon.

Learning: (3)
There is a lot to learn about the game because of it's long legacy. I think if you start with the basics it is not very intimidating. You can always learn different sets, keywords, game modes etc. as needed. It is a game where making your own deck is both the most helpful and yet most difficult thing to do well. Trial and error might be the best option. That, or copying someone else in their successful deck.

Gameplay: (4)
This is primarily a 2p game, so direct interaction is everything. Players are literally trying to bash each other to pieces. The first few turns are a bit uneventful, and that has recently bothered me. Other newer CCG/LCG have used different starting setups to make sure you are right in the action on turn 1. L5R for example has a stronghold and starting provinces to kick up the economy. Magic starts you with nothing. Once things get going though, players are constantly slinging spells and the action doesn't stop until only one is left standing.

Overall Fun: (4) 
This is still a fun game for me that I will play on OCTGN or with a friend's deck, but I will not sink any more money into CCGs. I am even hesitant about LCGs. Looking at the cost to fun ratio, this game is easily on par with my favorite tabletops that have come in 1 box and cost me $40. This game, because the fun is in the competition, pressures you to stay up to date and get the best decks and can cost you $40 twice a year. I applaud those people that can settle down with old sets or play pauper rules with only commons. I just think that neuters the game a bit.

This game is so broken. It makes you constantly spend money to stay competitive and interested. Some of the old cards are too powerful so they're discontinued, then new card concepts come along that your old decks can't cope with. The rules are constantly being updated, so cards made years apart have inconsistent effect descriptions. Eventually you will get into a huge argument over the order of effects or what exactly some ambiguous text on a card means. And there are so many out-of-control combos, including ways to get infinite mana, creatures or even turns. Does anyone do quality control over there? Richard Garfield should be fed to the Minion of Leshrac for inflicting this atrocity on the world. Unbelievable...

A truely original game concept, the cost is to high and it seems to need always new cards to keep the excitement.  I like the idea of a CCG but I don't know if you can build one that doesn't need constant new cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
If you consider the game aside from the CCG marketing aspect, it's excellent. The latest edition has been playtested to death in the field for over ten years, and there are plenty of tournament formats and drafts if you want to fine tune the balance even further. The deck customisation means that the game can be as complex as you or your group can handle... there's a lot of the pleasure of computer programming here, in terms of planning, algorithms, fall-through cases etc. There are a few clunky bits that prevent me from rating the game a ten -- mana screw and the timing rules being foremost among them -- but on the whole the game is very satisfying and incredibly replayable.If you would like to try it out without falling afoul of the collectible game problems, you can pick up common but playable cards en masse from eBay, or just buy a pair of preconstructed decks. 

Tradewise I am seeking:
- two Tiaga multilands (Revised) 
- a Thrull Champion (Fallen Empires)
- three Tinder Walls (Ice Age)
- three Birds of Paradise (any)
as well as anything else that would help out a red/green speed deck.

Magic a ni plus ni moins que marqué de manière indélébile mon entrée dans le monde du jeu, de 1995 (4e édition/Ice Age) jusqu'à Tempête (1997). J'étais au collège. Je suis tombé dans un monde passionnant, mais aussi un monde de requins. C'est quelque part dommage, parce que le jeu est à la fois simple, ludique, riche et attractif, mais la « rareté organisée » par l'éditeur, le prix élevé des boosters, et surtout l'aspect compétitif exacerbé (en partie par l'âge moyen des joueurs) a quand même entaché cette expérience « magique ». J'ai d'ailleurs arrêté après avoir été témoin et victime de trop nombreux vols, arnaques, tricheries et tournois transformés en concours internationaux de mauvaise foi.

J'y ai rejoué quelques années plus tard, au cours d'évènements-tournois hebdomadaires où la bonne ambiance était de mise, avec des decks prêtés par d'anciens partenaires de jeu qui n'avaient pas décroché. Sans doute mes meilleures expériences de jeu.

Je rachèterai probablement un jour une boite de boosters d'un bon stand-alone ou de l'édition en cours pour pouvoir jouer en draft, afin de transformer ce jeu de cartes à collectionner en jeu de cartes tout court.

I loved Magic from the moment I opened my first starter deck - brilliant design and tons of fun.  (Does anyone else go crazy for the smell of new Magic cards, fresh outta the pack?)  Sadly, it's too much of a money suck for me to mess around with anymore.  With new sets churned out endlessly, you have to keep coughing up cash to stay in the game.

RATING: 6
Card game about a confrontation between wizards, so it is basicly one of hand management and "take that".  The main attraction of the game is its richness:  many cards available, many ways to play and a lot of combinations can be made to form a deck according to your tastes and personality.  It is not a bad game, but it is certainly not as good as the mass phenomenom that it has become.  It could be rated even better, but the aggresive merchandise politics around it keep it down.  Buying a product without knowing what you get and changing its rules and even nulifying some cards without any compensation is simply illegal.  I don't understand why consumer associations around the world haven't done anything yet about this.

This game is the reason I'm in the hobby, had I not gone down that hole in 1994, I very well might not be a gamer today. I've played off and on for 20 years, and every format imaginable, in comic shops, kitchen tables, back rooms, FNMs, and grand prix day 2s. The way this game has shaped my life is nearly indescribable, it's taken me to many places I'd have not have gone and introduced me to very good friends I'd never have otherwise met. A simple 10 doesn't seem to do it justice.

One of the greatest games ever, of all time. There's simply no game that has the same amount of flexibility in the game. If you want a tense and tight game, playing a game of legacy mtg is there; if you want something casual, pauper standard or any limited format is the thing. co-ops, semi co-ops and everything exists as well! 

I don't think any game gives me the same sort of creative thinking as this game does. climbing out of a stax-lock, powering through a solidarity/high-tide through a chalice for one, resolving a double opalescence and flashing in a humility in a 4 player free-for-all. man, this game is simply the greatest.

When i started playing MtG i would have rated it 10. 
It tooks 11 years of play to reduce it step by step to just a 6.
Probably it's a matter of money. If you can afford to buy every new expansion probably the game will be renewing itself enough to keep you interested in it forever. But don't forget your friends have to do the same.. you are not going to play it alone.

I play it sporadically just to have some short-term fun.

One of my favourites.
The basic rules are quite simlpe, but there are cards that brake all of the rules, and once you learn the basics you realize that timing is of outmost importance.
New players should not be intimidated by the sheer number of cards, since all you have to do besides learn the basic rules is to read what each card says. You do not have to know them all.
In tournaments, there is a tendency of "most expensive deck winns", but there are some tournaments, like pre-releases, that gives all players the same conditions.
It is easy to get stuck in the Magic-swamp, and if you do, you will never have money to spare again. But nevermind that- you will have your cards!!

When this first hit the shelves, my friends and I were hooked!  As my friends and I are VERY competitive, it soon became a money sucking addiction trying to outdo each other.  Our addiction grew, collecting binders full of cards in different colors.  I remember buying full boxes of cards as soon as the new expansions came out, we would divide up the new packs, then we would sit in a circle opening them like it was Christmas!  Soon we would be buying singles from our local game store to strengthen decks and get an edge on our competition.  The sickness grew...

In time, I noticed that we would bicker and challenge each other about the rules regarding decks and card combos, ruining games.  I couldn't afford to keep up with some of my friends and pay rent at the same time.  As a result, I was always loosing, I couldn't compete, I lost the war of attrition.  Finally, after about a year, I began to hate this game for what it was turning us into, addicted, bickering, and broke.  I sold off my entire collection, cheap, to another friend who just started playing.  Poor guy, I warned him!  He soon was walking the same path I had...

Soon after, I dumped all of my collecting games in what I like to call the great collecting game purge, and swore never to go back.  I now play Magic but only on the XBox once in awhile.  It really isn't a bad game and it has all the things I love in a game, it's competitive, small, portable, strategic, and at times, fun. I just can't recommend this to any group that is VERY competitive and poor!  I still look back at this game as an ex-magic junkie trying to score a fix from their local supplier.  The euphoria of opening new card packets, looking at the artwork, counting the rare cards, then needing MORE!  Now days I check games for the need of collecting, and if that's a requirement, I quickly put it back.  That sour taste returns, the horror...  Never again!  EVER!!!

I spent a crapload of time and crapload of money on this--and I had a blast. I think that's because I never played in any tournaments. I didn't take it too seriously, and I didn't want to play with anyone who did.

I'll always have a soft spot for M:TG.  No other game is as flexible, variable, and beautiful.  It can be funny and clever.

Unfortunately, it's a difficult game to learn just by reading about it.  You need to either watch or learn from someone who already knows how to play.  And, oh yeah, there's that little thing called collectibility.  My ex roommate stole my entire collection, so that pretty much ended my M:TG playing, but I still highly respect the game.

- Only chance in the game is the order you draw the cards in (, which I like better then rolling dice)
- Awesome artwork
- Can use pre-build decks or build them yourself
- Not that hard to pick up (depending on the kind of magic type you want to play)

Cons
- It's easy to keep expanding your collection, which can get expensive..
- Currently no one around to play with..

This was a fantastic game that was marketed to death and just got too expensive to keep playing. But when it first came out -- what a blast. Building your own decks and creating new combinations of cards was novel and exciting. Good ol' days... To be fair, this game should be rated at the 8 or 9 level because of its high replayablility, fantastic expandability, and engrossing game play. And that's not even mentioning the fun of deck building. But when you burn out on MTG, you burn out hard...

Without question the cadillac of CCGs (and the original too).  Magic's only real fault is the collectible nature of it and the problem of mana screw.  If I logged my plays of this, it would be more than the rest of my plays in every other game combined.

Fantastic game, getting better all the time. Ravnica block is my current favorite. Booster draft is my favorite format but I can't afford to do it often. The money issue for winning constructed is valid, as is the addictive nature of this game.

Despite all the dissenters on this site, you have to recognize this game is HUGE.  You have to appreciate the fact that many of the gamers here on BGG are current or former MTG players.  It opened the eyes of a lot of people that there's more to games than Risk, Life, and Monopoly.  I've snagged more than my share of MTG gamers into board games at game stores when they stop by and say, "Hey, what are you playing?".

No surprise to anyone that I loved this game when it came out.  I grew disillusioned after about a year.

Though I don't care for the recent direction of Magic, I cannot ever deny that it allowed me a gaming outlet throughout the 90s that resulted in a great deal of fun and social connections. At some stages in my life it kept me sane when everything else around was imploding. I may not agree with the current direction  of the game or the plethora of new, young and seemingly arrogant competitive players, but there's no doubt that this has been more than a game to me, and in many ways is beyond a numbered rating.

MtG really belongs in a game category on its own because of its unique and long-standing existence starting the whole TCG/CCG genre. The huge support and community of dedicated players is unparalleled. Hate it or love it, you can't deny it's place in history. With all that is good and bad, it's a solid game in its own right if you can bear the financial and time burden required to keep up with the game.

RATING: 9
OK, perhaps I shouldn't really give it a '9' as I hardly ever play it any more.  But bugger it I'm gonna give it a 9 anyway because.....

The original concept of this game was brilliant - the simplest game in the world as all the rules are on the cards themselves.  MtG invented a whole new genre of games and for the whole revolutionary concept this game probably deserves a 10.

A brilliant game which I sunk many many hours and probably just about as many dollars and I feel that MtG probably also has a lot to answer for my Uni degree taking longer that it ought.

Obvious imbalances in some cards (especially earlier in the piece) leading to the restriction on their use in the Official Tourney environment.  The biggest problem is though that this imbalance not only affected the sanctioned Tournament environment, but even to stay competitive within your own circle or down at your local games store, to a certain extent you still needed to have a base stock of the standard 'good' cards and needed to keep on buying and buying and buying.  These impbalances made some cards simply redundant.

Of course I understand why with CCG's the publishers need to keep bringing out new versions.  But ultimately it was this that led me to needing to get out cold-turkey due to the cash-cow that this game became and I got a little annoyed with each new addition leading inevitably to more and more inconsistencies and more and more exceptions to the rules or official rulings being required.

But this doesn't mean you can't pull out an assortment of old cards with some friends and have a great time.

Nothing quite like building a ridiculously themed deck which hardly ever works, but when you get the right combination of cards up boy oh boy is it sweet sweet sweet like honey.

The volume of cards keeps the possibilities endless.

A great game, a whole lot of fun and let's not forget the Sedge Troll, my mostest favouritest creature ever.  The stench in the hovel was overpowering....

This should be a game that I really like.  It's got the whole fantasy / D&D thing going for it.  It's a card game.  For some reason, though, it never grabbed me.  I could literally watch people play for hours.  Even though I had access to great cards, plenty of oppenents, and lots of time, it seemed once you sat down, your fate was decided by what you draw and the decks built.  It seemed so mechanical--like the deck was playing me.  I suppose I would play it now if you gave me a deck, but what's the point.  Maybe things changed after Dark.

Most definitely a legendary game. The balancing of this game depends on your budget, and that is a concept that has always turned me off. However, if you have friends who casually play, it is well worth your time. Very simple to learn and play and the expansions and game mechanics change monthly. You never play the same game twice.

Does anyone really 'own' Magic: The Gathering?

I play casual; usually commander, but sometimes 1V1, 2HG, Archenemy, and Emperor. I'm more interested in interesting decks that are fun to play and play against than succeeding against some kind of local metagame. Even my 60 card decks rarely have more than 2 of a card.

Playing against others with a similar mindset is a great time.

The original trading card game, and still the industry standard. 10,000+ different cards and still going strong; that's a testament to the soundness and openness of the original design. If you don't like the marketing model (buying boosters with random cards or expensive singles in a kind of arms race against other players), you can play it casually by just building a modest card pool and trying different deck ideas.

Extraordinary quality in artwork and concept.

A fantastic game, my #1 for many years.  The basic mechanics are relatively easy to learn, although the intricacies of play can become overwhelming to a newcomer.  Fortunately, you can play MtG at many different levels of complexity and comfort, to suit your personal needs.  I love the deck-building aspect of the game, and especially enjoy putting together thematic decks that carry some strategic heft (e.g. Goblin deck).  I've never been competitive about it, and only rarely got obsessed about collecting 4 copies of certain powerful cards.  

I don't mind the collectible aspect, since I enjoy deck construction (using what you have) and I'm a big fan of the card art.  Of course, I've probably spent over a $1000 on my collection - although I've never been brave enough to figure it out.  Keep in mind though:  I've collected on and off for almost 20 years now, so that's not a bad investment, really, and I plan to pass along these cards to my kids or grandkids. I stopped collecting several years ago but wish I had someone to play every now and then.  I just won't do the Online thing, since I'd have to buy "virtual" cards all over again.

Issues?  Oh, it's got a few.  Mana-screw sucks.  Maybe 1 in 5 games will be intense and competitive and a real back-and-forth.  The other 4 will be either over quick or long drawn-out affairs.  Building and tweaking decks is more enjoyable than actually playing (at least for me).  And yet, given all that, a really fun game when it all comes together.

RATING: 6.5
Variable rating from 4 to 9 depending on the players. A good game to start with if you want to play a ccg. I'm not entirely happy with some of the game design though. The mechanic of playing lands can screw over a player completely and suck the fun out of any game. The power creep in this game is still reasonable, but the difference in power between rarities can occasionally really upset people. All in all, a fine game to play with matched opponents.

Duels of the Planeswalkers and DotP 2012 on my X-Box have me hooked on Magic again (played since the beginning, but quit playing and sold my collection after Fourth Edition).  I now have a small collection of the 2010 core set, Zendikar set and a few select cards from Rise of Eldrazi and Worldwake sets.  In addition, I collect Angel, Dragon and Demon cards from all sets (because I like them).  I also have most of the Duel Decks that have been released recently.

This is the game that got my fiance and I into gaming. If you don't take the collecting too seriously it is unbeatable for its tactics and cerebal qualities. However, if you have a tired old deck and you play against a fanatic with a new set - you'll lose. We seem to win and lose against each other in equal measures. On a summer's day you can't beat playing magic with a few bottles of wine. Most pleasant.

More interesting to build the decks than it is to play them.  The game is also based around designed obsolescence so that the publisher can make as much money as possible. Certainly it is a good game and it has been able to stay somewhat fresh for years, but keeping up with MtG requires too much time and money.

Played it from the end of high school and into my student years. A fun group of friends was soon exchanged with a tournament oriented scene, full of testosterone filled teenagers. After Tempest block went out (I started with Mirage) I gave up on constructed formats and have only played the game on sealed tournaments up to Odyssey (when I ran out of money and shifted to DnD).

Looking back on it - now, being older, I understand deck building better than I did then, and it totally doesn't interest me as it's too gamey. I much prefer games where I'm allowed to think on the spot and make decisions during the game, with some tactical options as well as strategic ones. In ye olde times we did have some more original illustrators. Anyhow, I hope I can get rid of the cards (baggage).  

And oh yeah, CCG format sucks. 

[i]Trade note: 6000+ low value cards, 1200+ lands, 300+ singles worth of notice (0,7 eur and up). Majority from Mirage and Tempest blocks, otherwise from Mirage up to Invasion, with some older singles. [/i]

Ahora apenas juego por falta de tiempo, pero cuando podía jugaba todos los días y tenía pura obsesion con la colección. Aún tengo 6 Carpetas enormes llenas de cartas. Eso sí, te gastas muchísima pasta en este hobby.
Si me sobrara la pasta, seguramente le pondría un 10. (Es el juego perfecto de cartas) Pero lo malo es que solo lo disfrutas al 100 % si compras muchas cartas y te actualizas a menudo. Lo mejor es el diseño de barajas.

Actualizado 12/6/2012: Acabo poniendole el 10. El precio de las cartas y que sea un juego de carta coleccionables, no le quita que el juego sea perfecto.

Don't blame a game for its marketing strategy.

Even with just a thousand common cards, which costs about $10.00, you can have many hours of casual enjoyment from different sorts of drafts, painful deck building decisions, and interesting gameplay. Games are short, too, about 5-20 minutes long, so you are never stuck.

Just be careful to remove any unbalanced cards if they pop up and ruin the gameplay.

I've been playing M:tG since I was 15 and its never grown old.  Infinitely customizable, lots of different rule variants for playing games (especially large mutliplayer games).  Easy to learn rules that have stayed relatively constant from set to set.  Only real downside is that it requires quite a bit of money to keep up on all the sets that WotC releases, and as a result I haven't collected any new cards for quite some time.

Truly sickening to think how much money I dumped into this in the 90's. I lost interest when they accelerated their release schedule and expansions started coming out every three months.

This game suffers from "Build Order-itis", meaning any one can be a highly competitive opponent just by researching the latest deck build and dropping down $100 on cards. Ultimately this is what turned me off from the game. I still buy sealed packs and play with friends once or so per year though. The sealed and drafting environment is still quite fun.

I've been playing a lot of commander (EDH) and this format is a ton of fun, with crazy board-states and interactions, and really brings back the nostalgia of the games my friends and I played when we first got into the game in the mid-nineties. 

I highly recommend both the commander format, but also the planechase variant with adds a lot of crazy interactions.

2006: Played Magic for years in high school and spent more money than I would like to admit on this "cardboard crack".  Recently returned to the game after a 10 year hiatus.  I enjoy the deck building aspect of the game the most, figuring out new combos and tuning things, but the game is terribly addictive and you will get bored of your deck after awhile and will need to spend more money to get interested in it again.  Enter with caution; if you have any obsessive tendencies, stay away.

2013 UPDATE: Me and my gaming group hit a lull a few expansions back, but in the past year we've fallen in love with the Commander/EDH format, and it's become the staple method of playing Magic these days, and I don't expect it to change in the future.  Regular Magic is great for dueling, but the dynamics, complexities and deck-building challenges provided in Commander/EDH has really invigorated the game for us.

THE definitive game of the 20th century and still continues to have clout in the cluttered games space of the 21st century.

Very clever concept (balancing the importance of a card with the cost of bringing it into play, allowing each player to bring their own deck to the game).

I'm not a cheap person but come on now. The cost to play even somewhat competitively is ridiculous.  Was going to get back into it after a 10 year hiatus after showing this money pit to a few friends.  We spent $200 in pre constructed decks without blinking and the decks gone stale after a couple hours of play.  I remember building a good tourney deck back then for less than $100.  To put a cheap tourney deck from scratch would cost $400 to $500. 60 3" by 2" pieces of cardstock should never cost that much. The game is great and highly addictive (thus the price), but the cost makes it a solid one.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]  It launched the CCG genre, but just doesn't hold up to more sophisticated later-generation CCGs. I mean, if I wanted a light and easy card game, I'd rather buy a game to fit that role instead of investing in a CCG.

2012 Further update: I took the time to re-read my original review (below), and although I will leave it alone (since it reflects my views at a certain point in time), I do not feel it is very accurate any more. The average age of Magic players is higher now, and playing at a large game store in a large city is an excellent experience. We've met some great people playing Magic. The scene is just totally different now. There is a large Grand Prix competition somewhere on the planet pretty much every weekend, and the efforts WotC has made to professionalize the game are starting to pay off. Also, the number of women playing has gone up and seems to now be around 5%...sometimes as high as 10% depending on where/when you play. It *used* to be about 1%. Yes, it's a game that attracts nerds, but the Magic playing venues I have gone to in the past year have all been quite pleasant. Nice people with just as good, if not better, personal hygiene than the general population. This wasn't always the case, but I haven't needed to smear Vick's under my nose since returning to the game.

WotC R&D have gotten better and better at what they do, and the game is now a pleasure to play. The Commander format has appeared to give casual players a fun multiplayer variant in which all cards are legal, and there is a thriving competitive scene for both constructed and limited formats. Magic possesses the psychological complexity of Poker (perhaps even more) and while the strategic depth may not be as deep as Chess, I don't think a comparison there is too off-base. Before 2000, drafting may have existed in Magic, but it just wasn't a "thing". Now you can do a booster draft at Friday Night Magic, and that is an awesome thing, as it's an absolute blast to draft. I once read about a Japanese gentleman who, upon retirement, decided to devote his time to mastering Go. I love Go, but there just isn't a thriving player base in my region. Magic, however, seems to be growing. So I think I'll make that nameless fellow my role model, but strive to master Magic instead.

2012 Update: With the Innistrad Block, I confess that Magic is once again fun for me. I'm just playing sealed deck with Innistrad and now Dark Ascension cards, but the block works so well as a stand alone set. Way to go, Wizards. I don't think it would be much fun to blend the current block with my old cards, but playing completely within Innistrad is pretty awesome. There are many interesting synergies, and every game is exciting!

2008 Update: You know, after years of exposure to the best designer games out there, returning to playing Magic was an interesting experience. I'm struck by how much luck is involved in winning. I still like how interactive the game is, I love the theme, and I think the art and so on is fantastic. But playing in a sealed deck type environment, or with a random set of cards (how we usually play), winning just requires tremendous luck in addition to skill. I am less interested now in collecting cards or playing the meta-game. I just want to play the game, and the game is showing its age. For years, this was the only designer/complex game we played. Now, I'm much less enthused about playing Magic.

Magic is a great game. We started playing before the Ice Age expansion, and kept playing after Ice Age was released. Then we got irritated with the constructed deck environment and stopped playing for many years. Then, in 1998 or so, we started playing again, and acquired a large collection of cards. Then we got fed up again with the game...until we developed our own way to play it. I would rate the game an 7 the way it is (what with the expensive cards and economy), but I would rate the way we play it a 8, so I'm going to give it 8.

We pooled all our cards together, separated them by color, and randomized them into 10 card units. Each unit has about 5 creature cards, and 5 other cards. Lands are not included. Then we use a random number generator to choose a selection of these 10 card units, spend 20 minutes building decks, and then play several games. Then we replace the cards, and pull new random selections. For example: let's say I chose to make a black-only deck. The random number generator would choose 4-5 sets of 10 cards from the 35 black units available, and then I'd polish those cards into a deck (with as many lands as I like).

Is this a lot of work to go to to play this game? Initially, yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely. With our system, we are able to quickly build fun and interesting new decks to play with. And you never know what surprises your opponent has in store when she has cards from the initial release of the game all the way up to those released in 2000!

Magic was/is a revolutionary game (Garfield you genius you!) - it spawned a spate of collectible card games. CCG have their detractors. I am often one of them, mostly because of how companies price and market the games. There is also the player base (shudder). Mrs. Sifu and I participated in a few tournaments (she always placed better than I!), and it seemed that many players of the game were people who didn't really have that much fun playing it. Whatever satisfaction they derived came solely from "beating" another person - which (if you've been to a tournament) shouldn't come as a shock. Most players are teenage boys who look and act as if they aren't "winning" much in other of life's arenas. This is not a knock on the game or its players, just an observation or caveat regarding many of its fans. If you intend to play in a public venue, brace yourself for offensive odors and boorish behavior. If you're a woman, dress like you're an Anabaptist. If you are a reasonably attractive woman, wear a potato sack and a bag on your head...unless you *like* being mobbed by the stereotypical Magic player.

Even though the early (fun) environment of Magic where people actually anted cards is gone, the game remains an engaging, exciting, and richly thematic. If there were a good way to play it multiplayer, I would rate it a 9.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I have not played it in a long time, although I still remember the experience as if it was yesterday. Spent a considerable amount of my later school years playing this.

It probably requires a network of at least a few people to trade cards with, in order to be truly enjoyable. However, it can also be played in a "draft" format, which does not require people to actually own cards.

The design is ingenious, it spawned an entirely new genre, and ultimately the now very successful "Dominion".

It does deserve a much higher rating than 7.1, and obviously a higher one than "Dominion".

With so many different formats, this kind of game is hard to rate. Eternal formats, in my view, are better that the rotating formats.

Be careful, this game is like a part time job! The problem with it is you have so many tools to find the answer for building the best deck which makes it an endless quest for the right cards, but also a very very rewarding one. Experimenting with deck variations is its best thing alongside with the tension from the competitions, the gameplay, your inner child recall, the artwork of the cards, the emotion of opening new sets of cards, the emotion of the spoilers of cards from the new sets...

After you really get into it, 
It should have a rating of 10 for anyone who has the time, energy and money for it, everyone else should leave it for later :)

I put it on hold when writing this review but itll always remain a 10 game even if i wont play it again.

Shame. Seems like an ok game but I refuse to support anything using this business model.

I'd rather pay a few hundred dollars for everything in a box than never see an end in sight.
But the biggest factor is the possibility that what you buy today may be useless when you compete a couple of years from now. Utterly ridiculous in my opinion!!!

Perhaps if they did different editions so we at least knew what we were rocking up to
"Want to play some M:TG 7th Edition?"
"Nah, but I'm up for some 3rd edition if you're keen"
"Ok!"
Then, at least, we'd know we were on an even playing field (assuming you could win with what's inside a base box and expansions would only be there for variety and replayability).

There are too many other excellent dueling mage games with great bases and fair expansions that will not rip you off for me to get into this.

Make a deck that is so fine tuned that it largely plays itself, then play against other prebuilt decks that you either have an inherently good or bad matchup against. Then hope you get acceptable draws (dont draw late game cards early or early game cards late, have a land to play every turn, etc.)

Great overall concept for a game but this has been outdone by now. And obviously the collectible model is trash tjhat gets in the way of enjoyment of the game.

I really love this game, but unfortunately I'm a recovering addict, so I can only play it if I don't spend any money on it.  Way back when (ca. Legends-The Dark-Ice Age) I played the hell out of this, invested a couple of hundred to a couple of thousand dollars in it and had a great time playing.  Then I went off to school, I didn't have play opponents, so it fell out of favor and I sold off all of my cards.  A couple of years ago I found Magic: The Gathering Online, and the cycle began anew, and I spent another grand on "virtual" cards.  I then decided that I could not return to my cardboard crack addiction, sold off what I had.... and then I found BoardGameGeek, and proceeded to plow all of the money I had into buying other games.  But M:TG is still one of my first loves ... but as I keep telling myself, I can't spend money on it anymore.  These days, I still play some using the old Microprose M:TG computer game, which is nice because it's all cards from the time that I played and enjoyed M:TG the most.

-----

I'm back on the train looking for cards, but since I've resolved not to spend money on the game again, I'm looking to acquire via trades and GG purchases.  I'm especially interested in the cards from when I originally played, e.g. revised, 4th edition, the Dark, Ice Age, Legends, et al.  I also liked the Mirrodin block from my online foray.

MtG is more of a hobby unto itself than a board game. Interesting, but I prefer games I only have to buy once. If you have infinite time and money, you might enjoy this one. Most of the decisions come at deck-building time, and these are severely constrained by what you can afford to buy--the player who spent the most usually wins. And what you're deciding isn't all that interesting, either. The main source of excitement is not knowing which cards the other guy has at his disposal.

Played this a lot in the 90's. But only with friends in a some what closed environment. never went to any tournaments or open game nights. Still, it was a LOT of fun.

Now a days i play it with my 9 year old son. I've bought som duel decks and some introdecks and it's still fun. But there are not a lot of compos and quite few of our matches are decided when one player doesn't get enough lands to be competitive or one player getting a card that is unstoppable. I would like the matches to be more tight.

Would really like to play a cube with 8 players sometime. But i would prefer that they were on the same  level as I am (the casual gamer level :))

A game I would rate an 8, if it weren't for the crack-like addiction it induced with some players, and if Wizards didn't keep adding rule variations from hell.       
  It's a fun game, and you can get enough cards to make/modify some decent, competitive decks for about fifty bucks.  (And if you can stop there ...)      
The obsession of hardcore Magic players has always reminded me of the same level of fixation that Advanced Squad Leader players have -- but with much more expense.

Say what you will about the collectable aspect or the culture surrounding the game over the years, this is still an excellent card game. Lately I mostly just buy intro pack/theme decks and play with those and enjoy it without the deck-building aspect tearing a hole through my wallet...

RATING: 9
The good: Unbelievably addictive deck construction. So many different strategies in deck design. Thousands of cards to play around with. 

It's fun to come across a really cool card, plan a deck around it, search for just the right cards, put it all together, and then pit it against other decks. It does crazy things to my mind.

The bad: Specifically, mana. I have yet to play in a tournament where there aren't complaints against mana screw or mana flood. It's a real problem with this game.

How do you get around it? Build a screaming fast deck. And that's the biggest problem of them all. To be competitive, It's like MTG wants to force you into one strategy: speed. That nullifies 98% of the super cool combo cards. It takes the fun from the good things listed above. So, you just built an awesome deck around a cool combo and want to see it in action? Sorry, you must keep up with the mana ramp. You haven't won by turn four? Go play with the amateurs.

Furthermore, you haven't spent the big bucks to acquire the speedy lands and low mana overpowered cards? Forget about it.

Still, my high score just highlights how insanely awesome deck construction is. Also, there are different types of play from standard to modern, vintage, commander, and draft.

MTG still deserves a high score on many levels, but it's just so sad to ponder and tinker for hours and fully realize your creation will not have a chance against a carbon copy speed deck.

Ah, Magic the Gathering. I'm sure I've spent more money than I should have on cards over the years.  The basic rules are relatively simple to grasp, but with so many expansions, it'd take a lifetime to master.  I realize there is a certain advantage conferred to players who invest more money (and time) into the game, so I've been trying to devise ways to make it more accessible to others.

I've recently completed building a cube, and after drafting with it, that's really all I ever want to do in Magic anymore, so (hopefully) that frees up a bit of my gaming budget for other pursuits.

I used to love this game.  Then I watched it decline.  I didnt think that it could be destroyed anymore, but Wizards of the Coast, in all their assine greediness has managed to do just that with the invention of Mythic Rares.  Now every game I play follows the same exact pattern.  I cast a spell, enemy casts a spell that is twice as powerful and costs 50x as much (in US dollars).  Nearly half the cards printed are immediatly considred useless and will be thrown away by most players.  Its not a game anymore, its a scam.

Peasant/pauper formats are where it's AT!

Update: For under $50 (including shipping), I netted complete common sets for Lorwyn, Morningtide, Shadowmoor, and Eventide. In eliminating the collectible aspect and balance issues between sets by purchasing a whole block's worth of cards to use as a common card pool for all players, I've fallen head over heels for Magic again. I like the Lorwyn/Shadowmoor block best, too, with its storybook fantasy setting and the tribal nature of the cards - you get Faerie decks, Goblins, Giants, Treefolk, Merfolk, Elves, Elementals, etc., so the theme even feels a lot more cohesive. 

By the way, my black Rogues deck will destroy you.

I missed the initial banzai of the game, but I've played several times online now with the Duels of the Planeswalkers sets, and I've enjoyed it.  I think there's a bit too much randomness involved and too much hoping to draw a card that you need, but the system is very sound and it's a lot of fun.  *Update* - picked up the Red and Green decks from the Duels of the Planeswalkers.  Son and I are having fun with them.

I use to play this game. At night I'd dream of combos with boxes of cards under my bed. I'd wake and tweak the cards till the sun peaked it's head. From lock-downs to life-gains, to Moxes and Duels. I'd purchase every card that crept its way into my dream world. Through the combos and possibilities, I'd ponder for days. Un-moving. Yet in the mind, the chains were pulling, the mountains erupting. The islands and plains burning, till I felt Ingulfed by sledge and the swamps. I sank. Happily. But alas from a glint and a corner. There was a spark, a light. Bright, glowing, from a foil of white. An angelic hand reached out to mine. And from the sledge and darkness, I was pulled awake. 
And I will never go back.

This would get a higher rating if I hadn't played collectable card games I like better than this, such as the Warcraft one. Still, this is an amazing, fun, highly diverse game with some of the best artwork you will ever see in any genre. The manna system is really where it breaks down for me though, as it is too luck dependent and therefore, frustrating. Many users knock this game for being collectable - but I really don't see the relevance of this critisism at this point. If you love it, but hate the collectable part, just make some fun, balanced decks from the seven million cheap cards available, and voila! You have an awesome living card game. 

One fantastic application of this game is to do the above idea - creating a non-collectable game from really cheap cards, and then give it as a gift to a young person who loves fantasy. I have done this, and believe me, it was very well received to say the least.

'scuse the language, but there seems to be an incredibly high "Fuck over" element that I want no part of.All of this is outside of the group that I play with. This group is big in the Honor department, and they are the exeption, rather than the rule.

Simply the best game I've ever played!
It's highly strategic since you're the one who decides which cards will be in your deck. Still very tactical, how to play these cards is very important as well.
There is still luck of the draw, but this counts for both players. With the amount of work that goes into building your deck, you're probably playing with this deck more than a few times and luck will even out a bit over the course of multiple plays.
It's also very balanced. There are 5 colors that play very different and these can be combined too, but still there is no colour stronger than the other.
It's got a high sense of achievement when a deck does exactly what you intended it to do. This game gave me some of the most satisfying wins. And losses, too. A mark of a great game! 
This game creates lasting memories; like the times I won a game with just three Goldenglow Moths or when I had over 380 zombies in play or when William had a life total of 272 playing his Vampire deck but still lost to my Felidar Souvereign. Most recently I lost a game when my opponent trampled me for a total of 1294 damage!
Card combinations are truly endless. By now, I've gog about twelve totally different playing decks, which is more variety than I need. I don't get to play each deck as much as I want to! Still, there's always the itch to keep working on each deck or even try and build something new from scratch.
I started around Zendikar block and Innistrad block is the first block I really invested in. Both the theme, feel and mechanics of both sets are much to my liking. Return to Ravnica is another hit, even while I wasn't around for the original Ravnica. The guilds truly are a wonderful accomplishment.

Green, Black and White are favorite colors. Red is alright and I don't really care for blue, but I'm starting to warm up to its play style, playing around with counter spells. Creatures are a better fit with my play style so I do like copy effects and stealing stuff. 
I'm a big fan of creature combat and favor an agressive playstyle over a more controlling approach. Isn't it fantastic how you can tailor the way you want to play?!
Seeing how much time I spend building decks, reading articles about it and actually playing the game: Magic: the Gathering ia absolutely, without a doubt in my mind, the best game ever!

The "fun" from MtG seems to be in the Deck Construction which doesn't appeal to me at all. The game itself is mediocre and largely rock paper scissors on the deck builds, meh.

Unglued/Unhinged decks are a good laugh though ;).

I did play for a little while as had friends who enjoyed it, but it frankly just pissed me off no end having people pester to look through my cards and trade - I like to be able to focus on the games I play, not random meta-game crap.... *Breathes*

Say what you will the Father of all CCG's is still the best. Infinite possibilities (if you have oddles of money), but don't have to pay a lot to play a lot. Portable (how many medium wt. games can you carry in your pocket?), versatile (a multitude of scenarios & formats) and always full of surprises this game can meet whatever your looking for in gaming. Sure there can be games that are not fun (ever been mana hosed?), but if your willing to try again the fun will way outpace the bad.

The original CCG and still the best. Or not, but after getting hooked on this one I'm not likely to pursue others very vigorously. I used to love both deck building and playing, but it does take a lot of time. Fortunately, you can still get in on Sealed Deck play easily (open cards, make decks, play) and there are preconstructed decks that allow you to play immediately. The constantly evolving game is both a plus (oooo! cool card!) and annoying (I WANT that card! ... Must resist!), but I'm past the have-to-have-everything phase.

A great game that you can (usually) play quickly.

Finally dropping my rating a bit, to a 9: I just never get to play this any more, and am now daunted by the sheer vastness of the card set and the time required to make interesting decks. I also find myself preferring multiplayer games more these days. Still, this is a fantastic game.

The first game that really got me into competitive gaming. The option to make a unique deck was intriguing to me. I played mostly with my brother, dividing all the bought decks where I kept the "green and yellow", he kept "black and red" and we divided the blue ones. It was a very interesting game, but somehow we got into a lot of "unbalance" over time. The packs sometimes had rare cards to benefit just one of us and we just dropped the game. Not to mention CCG is a bit costy hobby. But for what it's worth, it got me really into gaming, even though I wouldn't play it anymore. I don't like luck much in games and it comes doubly with CCGs.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is an awesome, infinitely replayable game, with a couple of caveats.  You do have to have opponents with access to the same cards or things are really unbalanced and not fun.  It is expensive if you want to stay competitive in the tournament environment; however, that is not necessary to enjoy the game.  

The things that are great about this game are the infinite variety of strategies, combos, and synergies; the fun of putting together a deck and seeing how it plays against other decks of different types.  

I used to play this somewhat competitively, but now I mostly play at home with my two boys (8 and 5).  I think it is even helping the younger one with his math and reading skills.

If you don't want to spend a ton of money, I suggest buying a bunch of commons on eBay or from your local store.  If you don't care about the deck building, there are a lot of fun preconstructed sets.  I recommend Garruk vs. Liliana, Elspeth vs. Tezzeret, or Phyrexia vs. the Coalition.  You can also find some older precon decks from retailers like Troll and Toad for five bucks or less.

I first started playing Magic around the release of Tempest and it instantly had a stranglehold on me.  I had an uncle and a few other friends who gifted me some of the older cards and I spent every bit of money I made in middle school to buy more packs at the local comic store.

Unfortunately that trend continued until I was an adult and discovered eBay.  I was competitive for a number of years and had some respectable finishes in local and state tournaments but the cost and time investment was just too much.  I've stopped and started again several times since (the first time I sold off all my cards I bought my wife's engagement ring with the profits).

I'm stopped for good now (I think) but I will still do an occasional booster draft.  The game is incredible, best CCG ever created and probably ever will be.  The system is so deep, elegant, and fun.  The only limit to variety in the game is your wallet and social calendar.  I won't give it a rating though because I have not played in almost 3 years (I stopped for the final time around Rise of the Eldrazi's release) and the game is always changing and evolving so today the game is likely very different than it was the last time I played.

Expensive.  
There was a time I'd have given this an 8 or 9, though in order to stay competitive new decks are always called for.
If you're interested in tournament play be prepared to throw a shed load of money at this.
Even if not playing tournaments, Wizards seem to be very good at making older cards redundant.  Power creep is also rife and I'd expect this to continue into the future.
I still keep a few of my favourite decks for friendly games, especially Commander.

To be fair, I'm not a big fan of CCGs.  Having said that, I was in college when this came out, in San Francisco, surrounded by fanatical MTG gamers who would twitch and speak in tongues at the mere hint that they might be able to obtain a missing Lotus or Mox card, many of whom were close friends of mine that I wanted to spend time with.  I tried to enjoy playing.  I couldn't.  I can't.  The very thought of playing MTG makes my brain feel like it's packed in gauze, and that's before I even contemplate the grotesque "limited edition" moneygrubbing that Wizards of the Coast engaged in by virtue of their control over both production and the rules.  Roger Ebert's review of "North" is right on the money here: "I hated this [game]. Hated hated hated hated hated this [game]. Hated it. Hated every simpering stupid vacant audience-insulting moment of it."  [I'm giving this a "2" instead of a "1" because it is not "clearly broken," although it is undeniably true that "You won't catch me dead playing this.]

Planechase is a great multiplayer variant of MtG (Magic: The Gathering) with four Wizards of the Coast constructed decks that are balanced for multiplayer, each assigned a distinct theme.  Each deck also has 10 plane cards.  These cards are new to MtG and have a random effect on the game state that usually impacts all players.

This is a cheap, pauper is still the cheapest, way to play MtG with friends.  It is a lower revenue product for Wizards of the Coast, and therefore does not receive regular expansions (none since 2009) like their core game, which is unfortunate.

Played it a lot on a casual level, 2headed giant (2 versus 2 with shared turns) mostly, awesome when played with other player on the same level of expectations. I was never interested in tournament style play or buying the best/most expensive cards and luckily my group plays the same way. Hardly play it lately because it's definitly overplayed for me and I'm not interested in buying new cards or trading or even constructing decks for years now. Pretty tough to rate this. It's by no doubt one of the most fascinating games ever made, but I never suggest it by now and have lost fascination, have to be convinced to play. Every rating between 5 and 10 could easily be justified.

RATING: 3
It's just boring and complex to me.  I will not discount that it is a very good TCG, but I find the combat mechanics highly annoying.  Why does the defender get to assign blockers?  This makes it so that I often don't know when I should press my attack in the game and often end up losing.

Although I think Yu-Gi-Oh is a worse game, I am better at it and actually like it more because in that game attacks make more sense.  The attacker gets to select his targets.  I just cannot fathom how or WHY the defender would get to assign targets unless the creatures in the game are just so stupid as to only attack creatures who say, "Durr hurr, I'm blocking you!"

The fact that this game requires a heavy investment to even remain competitive gets me, too.  I have only played it with borrowed decks since I dislike the deckbuilding element.  Can be decent with a good deck, but you're always at a disadvantage because your opponent knows what to expect from his own deck, so it's a two-edged sword.

The M10 rule changes suck the fun and opportunities for clever play out of this game. I very much doubt I'll be playing this much in the future.
----------------------
I'm seriously annoyed with Wizard's decision to add Mythic rares. Combined with the terrible implementation of MTGO v3, I'm pretty much off magic. Which is a shame as I've enjoyed the game a lot in the past.
----------------------

If I had to pick only one game for the rest of my life, this would be it. While buying more all the time can suck, you can get by on the cheap and still have lots of fun.I've been playing since '94, still very enjoyable. Deck building can be as much fun as actually playing. I like seeing new cards and don't have any resentment towards Wizards about all the new releases.

Game play is very diverse. Between two decks many games will play out differently. Add in the fact that there are thousands of different deck possibilities and I can't think of another game that can match. Also the various formats, some of which place restricts on deck building, others add various special abilities (ala Vanguard) or seating arrangements (ex Color Wars or Emperor), can keep this interesting for years.

The best game of all time?  Yes.  I can understand why people don't like buying new cards all the time, but the constant evolution of the game through new expansions is what I like most about it.

The designers do an incredible job keeping the game fresh by exploring new angles with each block.  The rules are complex but elegant.  The balance and variety of different deck types and strategies is very good.  Anybody who quit years ago has no idea what they're missing.

My last game of Magic is now more than 10 years ago. But from 1994-2001, I played this game excessively and had a tremendous amount of fun with it. I've never played this competitively (only participated in a few prerealese tournaments), buth the increased competitiveness and the ever increasing amount of cards did suck out part of the charm and fun for me.

Still have those thousands of cars lying around somewhere, but it's hard to imagine really picking it up again. The real game is in the deckbuilding and with a job, family and other responsibilites, there's no way I could do that even half-serious now.

And yet, it itches, and I *would* like to play with my old cards occasionally again. The game really is quite good.

I've slowly come to the conclusion that Magic is pretty good in a lot of ways, not so good in others, but is, in the end, way too much of a time and money sink that it's just not worth keeping up with.  I will always hold onto a few older decks though, for when my friends want to play something.

The mother of all collectible card games.

Magic is a bit like Madonna. Reinvented a million times, and somehow still churning out hits.

Many people I know have played Magic at some point, drifted out of it, then been pulled back in again to discover a fresh version of the game they loved all those years ago.

Interesting variants like Commander have also helped reinvigorate it.

And no discussion of Magic would be complete without some appreciation for the artwork. It is the gold standard, not just for card games, but for fantasy artwork in any medium.

D&amp;D and this have given me the most fun down the years, Magic:The Gathering is hobby in itself. The tournament scene is uniquely competitive attracting a much younger (and predominantly male) audience than boardgames, if you&#039;re looking for an intense gaming experience this could be for you. Note that it is NOT necessary to spend a king&#039;s ransom to play this game if you use a little common sense.

Totally not fun for the price that you need to put into it to be competitive. It's fiddly and the real game is building your deck beforehand since the deck will wind up playing itself if you made it well. I HATE the CCG/LCG format.

I'm not sure I will ever play MtG draft again, as drafting Epic is a breeze, but I think I'll keep a small MtG collection to do some casual constructed every now and then.

I had a deck and have played a couple times a long time ago when it first became popular.  I'm not a fan of CCG's in general as the "game" seems to be who can spend the most money on cards.  I'd like this more if the players decks were limited to similar rarities, etc.

Ok, I raised my rating a bit as I realize that you COULD have a house rule of making similar decks so the person that spent the most doesn't win every game and the mechanics of the game are fun.

I just despise CCG's and anything that requires "collecting" rare copies to play.

While MtG is a classic, and it's mechanics are design masterpiece, I'm not a great fan of the game. It is quite good, I could play from time to time, so I would rate MtG at 7, despite the fact deck-building aspect of the game is too time consuming. What I consider broken is distribution/business model – harmful for players and forcing them to never ending investments and upgrades. Due to, I would rate MtG at 1. Average is 4 and this is my rating.

EDIT--I have finally accepted M:TG for what it is--a great casual game with a competitive scene that you do not have to take part in. I continue to enjoy it after nearly 20 years of on and off gaming as a casual game played with inexpensive common and uncommon cards.

Here's the quandary: I enjoy Magic a decent amount.  But I don't enjoy the parts of it that come with it being a CCG--the giant metagame of building the tiniest, most efficient killing machine of a deck ("Aha, and I now cast an infinite-damage Fireball while simultaneously gaining infinite life!"), which depends on having decently large resources of time and money in order to do so properly.  I think Magic is a fine game with some basic starter decks or a friendly draft from a common pool, but anything else is just getting too elitist and crappy for me.

A great game that offers much more than just the collection hype that puts many people off.

I am sure if it weren't for the excellent gameplay value, the game would never have taken off in the first place - as is also proven by the many failures to copy Magic's success.

I started playing in February 1994, played some time on the Pro Tour from 1996 to 2001 (including participation at three world championships) and stopped in 2003, because I could just not invest as much time into this game anymore as it deserves.

I always tell my students that in order to play magic, you have to be smart. It helps to be rich too...I have given away a number of magic decks and cards to students. 

I am always looking to add to my collection.

Must have played this thousands of times.  I now only record competative play and I rarely play in competitions as the game is too expensive to keep up with.  Started playing around 1995 and started playing again when my children were old enough.  A fantastic game and very skillfull (especially like drafting).

The fun to be derived out of this game is largely dependent on how you go about playing it, given that it has so many expansions and possible deck possibilities. I do like the core mechanics behind it, but its collectible aspect is a big turn off for me.

Magic drafting is still the best game I've ever played, bar none. There's nothing else out there as varied and deep. This biggest problem for the new player is that the learning curve is steep, too much for some. And until you get good enough to regularly win boosters it can be expensive, but this is offset if you sell the 'money cards' to collecters.

RATING: 8
Haven't played this a lot (yet) nor a lot of other CCGs (yet) but so far this some seems to have earned its popularity:  The deck building is fun not tedious, the game presents interesting choices, and the game plays fast enough that you can play best of two out of three in around an hour.  That's casual play, of course :)  But that is another reason for the game's popularity: you can play this on so many levels and with any size card collection you can afford.  Most CCGs die off at some point and they should take a cue from Magic regarding starter and theme decks (I have yet to see another game with ready-to-go theme decks that are not only interesting to play, but in fact are very playable).  Right now, I'm only making Casual Constructed decks (4 rares and 8 uncommons maximum including the sideboard) for use in some multiplayer games I'd like to try with my group (Free For All, Two-Headed Giant).  

A lot of the artwork is phenomenal.  Not sure what all the fuss is about with the "mana screw" since you get to build you deck -- just add more land and add more low-cost cards.

Almost impossible for me to rate.  I have played it more than any other game, except maybe poker, but would always prefer to play other top games over it.  I love playing, but hate how much time I can spend on this game - not to mention money.  I think tournament play takes away your ability to enjoy this on a casual basis, but I am also skeptical about whether or not you can even be a casual player with so many cards, rules, changes, etc.  

All that said, there is no two player game I would rather play and no game I enjoy playing over and over as much.  The sheer variety to it is amazing.

Love the concept.  Hate the idea that I have to constantly buy more cards just to keep up with things.  It's been a long time since I bought any cards, so I imagine I'd have real trouble constructing a tournament-legal deck now.  Note: I'm really getting tired of emails from hopeful gamers asking if I want to trade or sell any of my old cards.  No!  I would have listed this game for trade or sale in that case, now, wouldn't I?  Stop pestering me about it.

What once was an amazing game has been reduced to a horrible mass of confusing cards. It is impossible to keep up with all the new things, not only knowledge-wise, but monetarily too. Still, it can be a fun game if you play with pre-constructed decks, so the game gets the quintessential "average" score from me.

RATING: 9
My rating is based on an unofficial rules variant I enjoy because it "fixes" some aspects of the game I don't enjoy. (Land flood/land screw, deck construction). All in all, this is, arguably, one of the greatest tableau/engine building and hand management games ever made. The sheer volume of viable strategies which have emerged over the last two and a half decades is staggering. The rules can be complex, the time and money investment can be large, but there are also ways to play which circumvent those issues. 

I started playing M:tG in '95 and have dabbled in many different formats over the years. Several times I have put the game down entirely for years on end, only to pick it up again when my interest rekindled. It's great that there are so many ways to play M:tG. If there's an aspect of the game you don't like, chances are there's a rules variant out there that will "fix it" for you - not to mention - others who like to play that way, too.

I loved to play Magic: The Gathering when I was younger but didn't enjoy having to buy cards constantly to play in tournaments as my friends stopped playing as they also didn't want to buy cards constantly. Aside from the complete money sink, this game is pretty fun being almost limitless in customization if you're pocketbook is as deep as Bill Gates. I prefer drafting tournaments where you open packs and pass the cards as I can create a deck on the fly and test my deck against other similar caliber of decks.

Ok, I’ll admit it, like many gamers of a certain age, I’ve spent way too much time and money on this game. The game stopped being fun when it became clear that hyper-tuned decks with fantastically expensive cards started to dominate every meet. Tournament rules regulating card generations may have moderated the problem, but it’s too late for me. I’ve still got binders full of cards and occasionally draft decks for fun, but I generally won’t play unless I know my opponents are casual players as well. The high rating is because it was a brilliant game and I got years of play out of it.

RATING: 8
Magic is one of the best designed, developed and produced CCGs, ever. Unfortunately, the depth of gameplay comes mostly from deck construction and matchup, while playing the game itself is often (but not always) mechanical. 

Magic's greatest asset is its huge library of cards. However, the source of this variety - CCG economics - is also the source of Magic's greatest weakness. Not only is it be expensive, it is often hard to find players who are playing the same format that you are, and nearly impossible to match power levels between two players' decks. 

Recommended way to play: Find somewhere that sells playsets of all the commons in a set, then play casual sealed/draft with that. It will be cheap and fun, and lacking the horror involved in collection and construction.

This game gave me hours upon hours of enjoyment and fun.  It lost its shine after a while as cards lost balance and started to be minimal variants of older cards.  Lately I've been finding it unappealing though; it seems like its just sort of putting out cards with no real feel of playing a "game".  Maybe I've been spoiled by euros.  I do enjoy playing the old MtG computer game.

One of the best games of all time. It's only a big money pit so NEVER EVER get suckered into playing tournaments or keeping your deck 1.0 or 1.5 compliant. 

I think every Magic player will recognize the experience of building up your deck, becoming REALLY good in it, and just when you hit the top -BAM! A new edition comes out and everybody starts whining about 'banned/uncompliant/restricted' cards in your deck, forcing you to spend money and time to redesign it and just when it's about good, it happens again. BYE BYE Richard Garfield, I'll stick to what I have.

Just getting into it? One tip: shell out $100,- for a BIG buttload of commons + land and just play boosterdraft with your friends. You'll get all of the gameplay for a fraction of the cost and it'll keep fresh every time. And if you don't like it anymore you can always sell them with minimal loss of cash.

[EDIT] Never play this anymore as so many other games come around. Collection is too valuable to just 'dump it' and have too many cards to be able to find the time to sort them out. So they basically just remain in their box with their sleeves collecting dust. A while ago I tried to have a quick look at just the best Rares and Uncommon ones on a USA website buying this stuff and easily made >€500 bucks for my collection of 4000+ (mainly) Fourth edition cards (add in some Unlimited/Revised/Legends and a bunch of Dual Lands and Force of Wills as well). Sigh.

It's extremely fun in a one-on-one setting. I love the card art and the gameplay mechanics, though the strategy comes into play almost entirely in the deck-building and preparation. Much of actual gameplay can feel overly deterministic, if still enjoyable. Against the wrong opponent, though, it can begin to feel too dependent on having the strongest cards, or the luckiest draw. I think it's best played regularly against a small number of opponents who don't always need to have the newest and most powerful cards. Blightsteel Golem (indestructible, knocks down half of standard life-points, and damages over time) for example is utterly uninteresting and can ruin an otherwise entertaining duel.

Compared to other CCGs I've played, Magic  maintains quality of cards, art, and balance quite well over time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Objectively speaking a great game design, but what killed the game for me in later years is the ways WOTC designed the game to make people keep buying cards instead of relying on your old deck which in my case has grown completely redundant compared to newer, much stronger cards.
The deck building can be very heavy, and once you play against people who build their decks towards one really nasty killer strategy (that they probably found online), it just kills the fun for me.

RATING: 8
I'll start by saying that I very much enjoy Magic. HOWEVER, I cannot recommend the game to anyone for a simple reason: its business model. In a nutshell, the best and worst part of Magic is that it is designed to be systematically unbalanced -- nearly every card in the game has at least a handful of other cards that can be better than it. While this sounds great and some people would argue that this setup actually makes the game balanced, you have no way of guaranteeing that you'll have those cards unless you're willing to pay a lot of money. 

At the end of the day, you can get the same experience from "balanced" Magic at a fraction of the cost with any of the modern LCG/ECG card games (Any of the FFG LCGs, Doomtown, VS System, Ashes, Mage Wars Academy, etc.).
While there is a part of me that hopes that MtG will one day reestablish itself as an LCG/ECG/XCG, there are more than enough good (perhaps better) deck construction battling cards games that I don't think you'll miss Magic.

I'm told that the real highlight of the game is tournament play, where you build your deck, play a round and then tweak it over the next two rounds.

I can see that, but I'm never going to play this game that frequently.

As a game itself, the beginner deck I used seemed very much to play itself and all my usual bug-bears were here: tiny icons (thankfully colour-coded) and tiny text that is upside down and across a table from me that I need to be constantly aware of, horrifically cliché artwork that takes up so much of the card that should be explaining to me what the card actually does, random terms that some cards have that impact things (Oh, God, I'm getting flashbacks to Blood Bowl)...

The interesting part seems to overwhelmingly be the part where you're not actually playing the game...

This famous TCG is not comparable to other games here.
Also, it is more of a family of games than a single game, because there are many deck formats and things you can do with the cards. You can even build own games/formats!

+ high quality game design
+ game theme and card tropes
+ great fantasy artworks(!)
+ elegant game mechanics
- games are often decided by mana shortage or mana flooding even without the opponent(s) interfering
- pay to win
- can be extremely expensive
- addictive in a unhealthy way

It is astonishing how much MTG is _both_ luck-dependent and skill-intensive at the same time. In competitive play it is not only luck-dependent what cards you draw, but also the dice roll at start of the match and against who (deck type, player) you're paired. But you always need to have a deep knowledge of all the cards, the mechanics, the rules, the meta game, your deck and more. And practice is also important. Despite the high luck-dependence skilled players have a significantly higher win percentage, even though they might loose against a newbie every now and then.


The community is very hype-driven, which I dislike. And the card hoarding and financial speculators are close to ruining the game. Also, WotC is flooding out new product in a pace where it becomes impossible to keep up.

Although the overall print quality is quite good, there are often cards that are off-center cut, which can be very annoying considering the high prices one pays for the cards.
And also, sleeving the cards, which is really necessary, quickly becomes expensive and tedious.

I started playing M:tG back in 92 right as Antiquities came out and I enjoyed the ride until the late 90s playing almost every Friday night for all those years.  I still look back on that time fondly and I enjoy the occasional play with some of the old cards that I kept, but I still have no interest reinvesting in the game.

I am a recovered MtG addict and played this game extensively and competitively from 1994 until ~2000. Starting in 1999, I began selling my collection, which included a full-set of the Power 9, as well as multiple complete sets of Third Edition and other expansions including virtually all the 'power cards' from Arabian Nights, Antiquities, and Legends expansions.

RATING: 6
Immensely well designed, but with a business model that is frankly insulting at this point. Duel Packs are a nice idea, but not as appealing as drafting or building your own, and once you begin doing that, the money sink starts.

Not fair to add MTG here, but as a limited game 'ie cube' it is very fun to play with 8 people. The learning curve can be steep even for someone who has played a little bit previously. But that is purely to do with the complexity of the cards in the cube itself.

Love this game! I think others have taken its place for me, however. Star Wars: Destiny is one that has eclipsed it, due to its mechanic of gaining two resources per turn (plus any additional afforded to you by your cards/dice). The likelihood of mana flood and mana screw are enough that I don't quite enjoy MtG as much as I used to, but it is still an excellent game.

RATING: 8
Magic is a really fun simple card game with more depth underneath the surface.  I wish the game was not a CCG.  I collect cards every now and again and plan to put together some preset decks to play with friends as an LCG.  CCG is such a scam.  Even so, this game started some amazing cards games and is amazing in itself.  Still my favorite CCG of all time.

Update: Raising this to a 9, I know this is a CCG and therefore isn't a game for everyone but the more and more I get back into it the more I realize why I liked this game so much.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
I wasted so much money on this in my youth but I respect their new "Prebuilt" deck concept.  It's grown up from the cash cow it once was.  That said, I haven't had any real ability to try it out in its modern form.  So these statements do not reflect my rating that much.  It did start the entire CCG industry and that stands for something.  My original rating stands for my feelings when I quit the game years ago.

Addendum: So I've tried the game recently with Dimir Intrigues (Ravnica) against Life Boost (Core set).  Appreciate the new decks constructions and theme, granted the smaller lifeboost deck destroyed the larger Dimir deck (Which oddly seems to be slanted towards burning through your opponents library.)  I wonder if sets are balanced within themselves.  While half the fun of magic was building decks I always longed as a young lad to have decks that were strong with theme rather then mechanic.  I tried time and time again to have a workable "angel and demon" deck, "Insects" deck and "Gryphon/Dragon" deck, all to fail to lack of mechanic/combos.  I do really enjoy the new theme heavy decks as starting points and have a renewed interest in the game now after just 3 plays.  Rating goes up for it being a cheap, simple yet strategic 2 plus player game with lots of options.

What a great design!
I love the ante rule, though it rarely gets used any more. 
The early versions were the best!
In an effort to continue to produce cards and make money, they've had to resort, in later editions, to cards with multiple abilities, filling decks with super cards. No longer do you have to make careful choices about what ability to keep and which to forego. Now you can have it all. What a shame!

Been playing this game for years, can burn a hole in your wallet but one of the best games I have played.

Easy enough for beginners to learn but deep and changing enough to keep a master on their toes.

It was fun in 1993.  Then it became a matter of who spent the most money.  This game completely turned me off of CCGs.  When Heroclix became like Magic, I lost interest in it too.  Fantasy Flight's LCG concept is an improvement (at least in my book).  If MTG went to something like that, I'd probably be back on this like stink on a turd.  I like the game, but not the commercial execution.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I still own some cards, but not my original set. I have some fond memories of my Magic days, but I think it's best left in the past. Decided to get out when some of the tougher cards to put in a deck were made easier with the new card releases. Also used to know all the cards, but disliked when I had to look at cards only to find out they were the same cards that I knew with a different name and art. After riding once around the merry-go-round the second trip with new art didn't seem appealing.

Okay, MtG is a fun card game but the whole idea of CCG's is less about making it fun and more about making money.  A game with this level of playability and pleasure could dispense with the rarity issue and just make all cards useful.  For me though, I would rate the game lower due to the cost except that I don't invest in the cards, I just have an entire collection of all cards on computer files from which I can print high-quality color proxy, cut 'em out, and sleeve 'em with little investment.

Overall, I LOVE the mechanics of play, I hate the rip-off prices.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Legendary game...  Only thing against it is the collectable aspect.

Used to build decks and play friends alot back in the day. (loved my grind, and flying creatures decks)

Cant be bothered with deck building now.. 

I have a fairly large amount of old cards.

We use a variant.  Its a great variant if you have a stack of old magic cards but dont deckbuild and want to still play it.  Not sure if this variant already exists but I have dubbed it "Wild Magic"

Each player has a deck of 50 non land cards (we just blindly grab 50 cards each out of my pile of cards.) 

There is a communal land deck (You decide distribution. We include the non basic land cards to mix it up a bit)

We then draw 7 cards, each draw can be from the land pile or standard pile. Play as normal. Very random, a flyer or landwalker can just win you the game, but games are normally fast and fun.  You just dont know what will appear. 

You will have to remove cards from the game that draw land cards out of your deck though as in this variant lands are not in your deck. 

Great fun, still a brilliant design, still playable like this in a casual format, simple and elegant.  A classic.

RATING: 8
Magic is a very good card game. I played it intensely for two years in high school. I obsessed over deck-building strategies, and pined for certain rare cards. I still enjoy the game, but don't spend any time building decks (a shame). What I enjoyed most about Magic when compared with modern deck-building games like Dominion, is that I had the chance to customize my cards to work together before playing, as opposed to trying for the same effect on the fly. Magic emphasized skillful card play and deck building, as opposed to just deck building.

It's still a classic, and one I'll usually play when requested. Although nowadays, I typically reach for the excellent duel decks, which give me all the feel of Magic with almost none of the upfront effort. In fact, if all you purchased were a few duel deck packs, I think you'd have a top notch game, well worthy the price of entry, and with enough strategy to keep you busy for many, many hours. What keeps people away, I assume, is the reputation the game has for costing a bundle, both in time and money. It's a shame because the game itself is still solid.

RATING: 9
I love Magic.  I have played Magic on average more than once a month since 1997, and still love to play.  That is virtually unheard of for a game.  Magic gets a lot of negative comments because of its collectable nature and the perceived wackiness of the tournament players, but underneath all that it really is an amazing game.  It has a fantastic amount of depth, from deck building right down to which land to tap for mana.  Over the years, we have played in tournaments (pre-releases mostly), Standard (which uses only the most recent cards), Extended (which uses a huge pool of cards), Type One (which uses a huge huge pool of cards), Rochester Draft, Booster Draft, and Sealed Deck.  And we've played all those formats in two-player (duel) format, and in multi-player.  All are different from each other, all are amazing.  Magic is an incredibly flexible, deep, smart game.

I've played a load of CCGs, mostly all back in the late 1990s. Many of them I have liked. Magic is just the best, though. Recently the Cube Draft concept has sort of revitalized my interest, although the new cards with the new borders are so ugly that I cannot bring myself to buy or use them.

[T-shirt=COLLEGE][/T-shirt]

Huh! I thought that would work. C'mon BGG!!!

MTG = Late night sessions = Going to Breakfast before going to bed = Matt cutting our 130 card deck into thirds and laughing at us.

For some reason in college I was the person that when people decided they were done with MTG they would give me their collection. This happened at least 5 times. As a result, I have boxes of cards in my basement. I recently went through all of them and culled out anything with a trade-in value. I ended up with over $700 in trade in. (see this list--A list of games that I got in "trade" for my MTG cards.

THE collectible game.  I played Magic a decent amount in the 90's, then pretty much stopped in the 2000's.  Now it seems to be making a comeback.  I loooove doing drafts and sealed deck construction, but have absolutely no desire to play with constructed decks.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Cardboard crack.  I don't even want to think about how much money I blew on this but it is a great game that has aged quite well and offers something to both beginners and masters.  The luck element (manascrew) is still high though and I think some of the newer CCGs do a better job of this.  Still it's the game that founded a genre so it's a classic!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.8
There is not much I can say that hasn't already been said by many in the hobby that have left Magic behind. Like those people, I still sit in awe. Magic is both exalted and ruined by it's collectible nature; it adds a rich dimension to it's meta game, but also makes it terribly expensive and unbalanced. Tournament play fixes this, but limits you to a highly competitive scene, which is still terribly expensive. Drafting fixes that problem to a degree, but can render your cards useless after one play. But it is still so, so much fun.

Trying to construct the most efficient deck amongst a combination of cleverly designed cards and abilities with even more cleverly conceived combinations is part of the draw to Magic for me, as well as the large pool of possible cards and options. It is a world waiting to be explored. I may have exhausted myself of much of the Magic 'scene', but I still adore and admire the game and Modern and draft will always have a special place in my heart.

RATING: 9
Despite its design flaws (the mana screw/flood problem) and potential for erratic quality from one expansion to the next, this is still one of the best games ever, in large part due to the variety of formats available.  There's always a format that's fun in the way you want it to be.

I owned a bunch of cards back in the days of IceAge. I played it a lot, and would have rated it more a 7 or 8 back than.

I don't own it any more, as my interest for CCG in general went straight down. I find it a real disadvantage for MtG that you really have to stay on top of the new expansions if you want to stay in the running.

I practically don't play it anymore, save from the once-a-year booster draft organised by a friend of mine

I enjoy the deckbuilding aspect of the game.  However, if you don't have someone else building decks with you, it's no fun to play against your own decks.

RATING: 3
Moderately interesting CCG when it first came out in the early to mid-1990s.  But when it started making money, the producers couldn't leave well enough alone.  They manufactured expansion after expansion, including weirder and more game-twisting cards.  Eventually, the way to determine the winner became "who has spent the most money on decks?"

RATING: 2
Interesting game mechanics, some beautiful artwork, and had some good times playing this.  But let's face it, I just wasn't rich enough to be a good player.  A lesson learnt.

Maybe someday I will find a way to enjoy making a game out of the cards I own, without having to constantly buy more.

Another oblique observation:  When playing boardgames, I meet lots of lovely people, and the occasional tosser.  When I played M:TG tournaments, I met lots of tossers and the occasional decent human.

Building the deck is more fun than playing it. And its a lot of fun to play it. Strategies and meta strategies of building the decks for tourneys and playing are awesome. The big plus is the rich history of the game and all the amazing cards to choose from. The (big?) downside of this game is that it is very expensive to play at a high level. The play by it self is not as tactical as some of the other good card games.

Hits squarely between a 4 and a 6 for me.  I don't care for it all that much--it does not have a hook for me to keep me interested.  But I will play it now and then.

Maybe I just read too many horror stories, and it's reputation preceded it.  I am sure that there is a tremendous system in there, especially when you are able to play it on a regular basis or compete in tournaments.  But for me, I have no desire to play it on my own, or "get into" it at all.

When this game came out, it eclipsed everything else we were doing in gaming for quite a while. We have all the sets except maybe the last 3. I'll pick those up one of these days. Just a super game. Hard to find other people in the area designing decks to play with now, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I've played this game on and off for almost twenty years and I've got to say that for the most part I love it. It has its ups and downs because of the sets not always being good but it's just not possible to sustain greatness at a high level for an indefinite amount of time in the gaming industry. Sometimes you're going to whiff. I love playing in the limited formats much more than constructed. The biggest (and maybe only) drawback to this game is simply the time and money commitment. If you want to be successful in tournaments you have to take it more seriously than "just a game" which can burn you out on it if you allow the enjoyment to be robbed from you through this process.

RATING: 7.5
I have an immense amount of respect for Magic -- I think it's a solid design, and it deserves mountains of credit for sparking a new renaissance in gaming.  This game defines a large portion of my youth, and the memories it evokes for me are -- dare I say it? -- truly magical.  In those days before the ubiquity of the internet, the experience of opening a pack and seeing something new or playing someone and encountering a crazy combo was as close as I'll ever get to exploring another dimension.

That said, I've lost interest over the years.  The underlying game is still solid, but I think the overall design has become bloated with keywords and gimmicks.  Everything has gotten so attractively slick and focused on the tournament/FNM scene.  And a slow but steady power creep has rendered many of my old cards obsolete -- cards exist now that do the exact same thing at a fraction of the cost, and it irks me.

Though I have several friends who are still enthusiasts, I'm more or less done buying cards.  There are a lot of great ways to enjoy the game, including cube drafts and Pauper formats, that don't involve adopting the whole MtG lifestyle, so I still think it's a game worth playing.  But I'm no longer interested in collecting.  

Willing to entertain trades -- I have about ten thousand cards ranging from Revised edition to the present day, more or less.

RATING: 3
Read most of the comments of people who rated this a 1. Most of them share my reasoning for giving this a low rating. This is a shameless money grab of a game which rewards having money over having skill. Will never play again with a serious player unless they have a spare deck as I will not spend hundreds of dollars on this game. There is a good chance I won't play again at all though, as I think there are better games to play and things to do. I haven't played in years as is.
Past experiences have certainly soured me on this game as well, as many of the players devote large sums of money from each paycheck so to get expensive cards and be able to defeat and feel superior to their friends and other people. Many even resort to cheating. I have probably had some particularly bad luck with the regulars of this game, but many ccg's will attract this type of person.
Taking away the atrocious behavior of Magic players I've dealt with in the past, and taking away the unfair 'he with the most money wins' element, and ignoring the fact that people have spent ridiculous amounts of money on this game in an attempt to keep up with others or chase rare cards or make others feel inferior, I will say a few other things about the game. The art on the front of the cards is decent, the card quality is pathetically bad (but if it were good they wouldn't have as much reason to charge you extra for those protectors, right?), the game has helped keep hobby shops alive because of how much people spend on it, it has helped bring people together because of its popularity (although I've also heard of many fights and lost friendships over the game as well), the mechanics of the game itself were relatively simple from what I can remember, and I myself was never blown away by it. 
Honestly, ignoring everything but the gameplay, I would still say that there are many better games out there to devote your time and money to.

I played MTG from Weatherlight until just before Urza's Saga. Originally, I felt the game was an excellent idea: two wizards dueling each-other with customized spell books. The game began to shift directions, however, and became more focused on people fighting each-other with the two player's in more of a god-like position.

I didn't care for the changes, but enjoyed the time I played.

This is a game that only truely shines if you are insane enough to sink a vast fortune into it...

If I had just a single pair of decent decks to play with for all eternity, I'd rate this game a 6.  (Cost $50-$100)

If I had a small collection of well tuned decks to choose from, I'd rate this game an 8.  (Cost $500-$1000)

My 10 rating only applies if you have a card library large enough to make deck design interesting, you have opponents with access to the same or a similarly extensive library, and both opponents know the cards and libraries well enough to produce solid/unique deck strategies. (Cost $5000+)

I have played this countless times in the past, but I have not played for a few years due to a lack of opponents.  Finding players with the time and passion to study a card library is not easy.  I'll play this game at any opportunity.  That day probably won't come soon, unless I can get one of my kids interested enough to devote their energy to learning the art of deck building.

Things have certainly gotten carried away with this game, but it is a truly original, tremendous design concept.  As much fun creating the deck as playing it.  Multiplayer actually appeals to me more now than when I first started.

RATING: 10
I have played magic since unlimited edition.  The game has changed a lot - from 3 mana for a 2/2 to 2 mana for a 3/3.   I fear the worst for magic.  The cards will have to keep getting better and better for Wizards of the Coasts to keep convincing people to buy, until what?  Victories on turn 3?  Magic is doomed by it's own success and need for future success. 
That said, I play almost weekly - kitchen magic.

Yes, Magic. Yes, that low of a rating. Why? Because it's just not that good. Really, it isn't. Yes, it was first. Yes, it sucked me in too. But as I began to play, I started to notice things. Rules. Terms. Styles. 
It's just not a well-made game. The rules have changed so much that no one remembers what "Mono Artifact" means, nor an "Interrupt."
And it's still a broken game.

Many more CCG's have come since this one. A lot were crap, but some were good and a few great. Many of those beat the tar out of Magic with good rules, well structured play and great mechanics. But, since they weren't first, they died or didn't make nearly the same success.
If you like CCG's, try something else. I can name a bunch right now:
Warlord, Game of Thrones, Legend of the Five Rings and more.

Don't be suckered!

Lots of cards from over the years, lots of EDH decks prebuilt, some modern decks prebuilt and some other stuff. Sadly don't play it nearly as often as I would like, because nobody around to play it with (am a filthy casual, so FNM isn't really my thing and the EDH sceen at the LGS is small and not especially receiving to new players. So most of my  plays are MODO and MTG Duels. The collectible aspect sometimes makes it expensive to get that one card I want for an EDH deck, which is a bummer. But otherwise this game is near perfect for me. Too bad I only very rarely get to play it. Play counts will reflect variants like the deck building variant "Deckmaster", too, because that is what I get to play nowadays.

I got sick of it once I started playing against really competitive type decks but the reality is that this is an amazing product, and the new sets just keep adding value. The secondary market adds an interesting element for collectors. 

Almost perfect mechanics, tons of players, scheduled additions. It became an arms race in my group and that eventually is what sucked my enthusiasm out of it but I will always appreciate the hours and hours of entertainment..

One of if not the best games I've ever played with the unfortunate caveat that I needed to keep $3000+ of capital tied up to play it. With that much invested, as soon as I wanted to play a couple of games a week as apposed to 50 games a day I cashed out.

I got really into Magic as a pre-teen and wish I hadn't traded all my cards back then. I know, I'm utterly unique in that regard.

Anyway, coming back to the game--it's such an incredible game. I am not someone who wants to play the same game over and over, but Magic has such great (infinite?) replay value that it does lend itself to that.

However, I'm not enough of a competitive player to really stand toe-to-toe with people who are really deep into the game to where they deck-build and already know many, if not most, of the cards by heart and have mental logs of scores of devastating card-combinations. If I had more time, I'd invest more of myself into studying the game in that way and playing more often, but right now I'm at a place where I really just like to play the occasional casual game or two and drawing cards that I've never seen before and trying to play them well on the spot in the context of a given game. Plus... the whole collectible aspect is something that no longer appeals to me (such a time and money sink).

But, I feel confident in saying this is easily one of the greatest and most innovative games of modern history.

A necessary evil. I'm glad MTG keeps the doors open at the FLGS, and I'm glad I played for a bit--Magic has influenced so many different game over the last 20+ years. Having said all that, I don't miss playing. Hearthstone isn't a direct replacement, but it's pretty close and it's much, much cheaper.

Miss Rhodes Says: In this card game each player is a wizard and must try to destroy the other players by using a combination of enchantments and attacks with creatures that are under the wizard's control.  Each wizard takes his power from the land.  This game is a tactical one, and requires each player to work out how he can attack his opponent whilst defending himself.  This game becomes much more enjoyable once you have grasped the basics and is really good fun.

RATING: 9
If you can invest the ongoing attention and energy towards this, it's probably the greatest card game I've ever played.  I've played Magic on and off since 1994 and it is always interesting and exciting.  As for those who find it a money sink, it certainly can be if you don't set boundaries.  But playing casual or eternal formats and spending about $50 each year (less than keeping up with Dominion) you can stay pretty up to date and have fun.
Planescape is worth checking out too as a singular purchase to experience Chaos Magic.

The best card game ever. The only card game with entire stores devoted to it. The card interaction and strategies are limitless and there is a monstrous following.

Its the only game I will never get tired of playing.

The game that got me into gaming... This game surely takes me back to my high school days, and until now, still excites me with its constant stream of new expansions. Everyone has a preferred format with mine being sealed deck, booster draft and Commander.

I enjoy playing this game a lot, but I probably enjoy building decks and coming up with ideas more so. It's an addictive game in terms of buying and finding new cards to build better/different decks. The downside is that I'm a casual player so I can't really hop into the Friday Night Magics or tournaments or stuff like that, so I just have to try and find time with friends to play which can be tricky. I recommend this game for teaching people logic and strategy and don't mind teaching it.

Won't play this IRL. Don't have the money nor the desire to get into heavy deckbuilding. Pre-made decks aren't really that fun.

Previously owned it as an app. 

I refuse to buy the TCG's or CCG's "whoever has the most disposable income wins" game. 

Unfortunately, the app makes you taste the game, like it a lot, and then have to buy the game. If I wanted to make payments to play this game, I'd just buy the cards.

The saving grace of the app (if I was to buy the game instead of uninstalling) would be that I'd get to play against an AI. I only know about 2 or 3 people that play Magic so having an AI would be great. AI on the Nintendo DS really helped with my Yu-Gi-Oh addiction...

I know my husband wants to lynch me for thinking it, but I just don't care much for MTG. There are so many other things I would rather play. It doesn't help that I can barely read the tiny print on my own cards let alone trying to read those across the table. I'll pass.

I don't collect cards but I used to draft for ~a year. It's a game with strong mechanics and excellent replayability, but you shouldn't overdo it (as with pretty much everything).
I'm against ccgs, I've seen people (including a friend) getting addicted to this, I think this is horrible and thus I cannot rate it any higher.

I've played this one again recently and it shows heavy signs of age compared to newer card games. Finally.

Its a collectible card game... that is it's bane.  The game is great when your playing something like a draft where everyone is relying on thier own skills.  But playing games for fun with decks people make, simply isn't much fun.  It becomes more about who has the most expensive cards, not who is the better player.

Younger me loved this game, I started with this game, and have always continued to play every single pre-release. I adore Commander mode (EDH), but I no longer have any love for competitive modes. I am a casual through and through. I could not longer justify paying for a competitive deck. The game still has wonderful art, great and solid mechanics, and enjoyable rounds of play. It is just very pricey to play. I do recommend it to anyone and everyone.

Who did not play Magic as a teen? Haven't played much since high school, though. I still have a couple friends that insist on playing with me, so I will pay using a duel deck or preconstructed deck. I would rather play Epic.

RATING: 7
Two rankings at work.  If people are playing with a similar selection of cards this is quite enjoyable.  Probably a 7 or 8.  Its fun being a mad scientist and tinkering with your creation to blow up your opponenet(your deck).  In the real world, the spend the most money on the best cards.  Add errata and rules lawyering, and I'll pass.  It can work as a gateway game however.  I just think I'm done playing.  Awesome with a limited card set, sucktastic with the cash arms race.

Ah crap, my nephew has become interested in this game.  Playing outside of the arms race is a great time quite honestly.  No desire to ever enter the arms race, but some agreed upon restrained format (variants can be found all over the place) this is a great time.  I give it an 8 or 9 with that format, and a 5 without the constrained format.  That will put my rating at a 6 or 7 so we'll go with a 7 for now.

I'm a recovering Magic addict.  I spent over five years (from 1995 through 1999) pouring way too much money into this thing.  It was/is such a great game, but the commercialization of it, and constant stream of new cards, eventually put me off.  I still have thousands upon thousands of cards stashed in the closet.

PROS: •One of the best card game systems ever created. I am over and over again impressed by the quality of the ruleset. Magic has grown to become a huge universe but still it manages to be consistent. It followed me throughout my youth and my interest in the game went through some waves, but I always admired it as one of the best card game systems ever created; • With an ever-growing range of cards abilities, replay value is monstrous; • Every card has a cool unique art (or several, depending on the set) and design - except the really old stuff; • Very strategic gameplay despise the luck-of-the-draw effect: several levels of strategy include deck building, reading you opponents, timing your choices, calculating battle outcomes beforehand and so on.

CONS: •Magic grew to become a game with both hardcore and casual fanbases. If you want to play the most common format of Magic, "constructed", be ready to read a lot, copy a lot of already thought decks, search through endless databases of cards and most important: Spend a TON of money. The CCG aspect made me give up on this game mora than once. •Balance issues: The most common way to play Magic is against a friend that also has Magic. So it's not a game that you open a box, split the components and play a balanced match with your friends. Decks will be worse than others despise the skill factor, tweaking will be constant and necessary. And expensive. If there were no alternatives to this, I would never come back to this game. Read more about it on the Conclusion below. •The luck aspect can kill your match (if you only draw lands / no lands at all) and, being limited to 1 draw per turn, sometimes in mid-late game you depend on what you draw. Draw a land and... improve your board 0%. Draw that powerhouse and the match is yours. Luck.

CONCLUSION: If you love the game system but hate the collectible aspect, i.e. you wanna play it as a casual game, grab some pre-made Duel Decks (these come in pairs and are THEORETICALLY balanced) and/or assemble a Pauper Cube (google how to do it), which is a collection of common cards specially balanced to draft with your friends. You build your decks on the go and play. I do it this way and now the game fits my budget and my interests as a casual gamer.

RATING: 7
The only downfalls are the price of new and good cards and the crap sifting one has to do to make a competitive deck. The game shines in a coffee shop, on the street, in a house, or pretty much anywhere you can find a friend/enemy to battle with.

Bloated, over complex, and overwhelming to jump into, but still a whole hell of a lot of fun.  Most importantly there need to be an "agreement" between players to make decks that are of comparable power levels. The complete lack of balance in casual play is exactly what got me to move on to board games.

RATING: 9
People rag on this game largely because of the money-sink factor. I won't say that factor isn't there, because it is -- you can easily spend lots of $ on the game. But first, about the game itself: It is very intricate and has lots of depth of gameplay, both in deckbuilding and the actual play of the game. There are many, many effects that the cards have, and the interactivity is extreme. With the sheer number of cards, even in a base set, the replayability factor is sky-high; add cards from the ever-releasing expansion sets and it is higher than any other non-RPG I know of. If you're willing to abide by limits on cardpool, you and a group of friends can easily play hundreds of hours off, say, $50 worth of cards.  

Okay, that said, about the money factor: You can easily get sucked in and need to buy 'just one more booster (or worse, booster box)', or find yourself paying $20 (or more!) for a 3x5 cardboard piece that is 'just the right card for your deck'. If you have this sort of addictive personality, even if you would otherwise love it, run away unless you can afford to (and are willing to) spend hundreds of dollars every year on Magic cards. You'll love it every instant, but you'll end up broke. Wizards of the Coast wants you as a customer, and they will keep releasing expansions for you (yes, you) to buy.

On the flip side, Wizards has been careful (particularly recently) to make sure that rare does not always equal better, so if you equalize the 'money factor', by playing Limited formats (check out Winston draft to reuse cards) it can work very well. (N.B. rare seems to equal better mainly, I think, because the rare cards are usually narrower and therefore better than anything else at that narrow job, so if you need that effect, you want the rare. But rares in general aren't more useful overall than commons).

There is an online magic server run by Wizards where you can play preconstructed decks for free, and play other decks with 'digital cards' (which you do have to buy, natch, though access to the server per se is free). The server does an excellent job of enforcing the rules and I recommend it to people who can safely come into contact with the highly addictive substance that is Magic.

Mechanically well-structured, but not all that much fun.  Like the game it inspired, Pokemon, this game functions on the necessity of spending bundles of money to collect a few cards which can defeat anything.  Unlike Pokemon, however, this game doesn't self-advertise as being Capitalism with cards with a catchy slogan like "gotta catch 'em all!"

For those of you who have had sexual intercourse in the past and think that it might be cool to do so again at some point in your future, I highly suggest not using terms such as "fatty" to describe your cards or creatures.

I have a big soft spot for this one.  I still have 1000s of cards, but don't play.  I love the artwork, the concept, the themes, the collection aspect with cards and folders and boxes, the surprise of finding a cool card when you open a new pack, the amount of fun you can have just with a few cards a dice and a friend, the ability to build new decks that completely change the game, the tournaments, the sealed deck games, the tight specific rules (ok, so I'm pedantic). :P
So much to love, but I think I just played it for too long.  Still play irregularly, but the cost is preventative from getting into it fully again..

RATING: 10
I have a complete love/hate relationship here.  I was crazy about this game when it came out, but have found myself less and less interested. I think the complicated expansions have dilluted a simply brilliant game.  Best time I ever had playing was 5 players, one as each color.

At the time I started playing it (3rd edition, right after Antiquities), I'd rate it an 8.

**Update - 12/14/09  Oh, come on now Joel, don't be so negative!  I started playing this again and have dusted off my collection.  So what if the new cards are bannanas?  Yes, yes, some of the new mechanics are definitely a little less friendly than others... but so what?  Magic is still a blast to play, and simple cards like 'Jump' and 'Unsummon' can still wreck someone's day.  

Bumping my rating to an 8, as I am perfectly willing to play with the right crowd in a casual setting at almost any time.  The new art on the cards is also pretty jaw-dropping... the quality has been steadily increasing over the past decade.

**Update - 1/9/2010  Back in big time!!!  Played in a formal Friday Night Magic event, and have been throwing myself full-bore into the hobby again.  How I ever left this game is a total mystery to me...  I love the mix of luck, skill, variance, play types... It is like 500 games in 1.

Cranked my rating up to a 10, writing the last decade off as a hiatus caused by life and a sudden change of scenery.  I can't imagine not wanting to play this game in one of its myriad formats.

**Update - 5/20/2010 The love affair has staying power.  Magic is easily being played on a 5-1 level vs other games currently.  With the various formats including Standard, Limited, teams, etc, this game has enormous legs.

**9/13/2011 - The past year has been good with great games, new releases, Planeswalker Points, and more.  Love this game.

RATING: 5
So... I'm a little bit late to the party on this one. But Bob had just bought a few hundred cards or something and decided he wanted to do a drafting game of Magic. I think that you're usually supposed to draft cards from packs which are guaranteed to be somewhat balanced. That's not what this was... it was random cards from random sets and it was not even remotely balanced. About half the cards that I saw were black, which isn't what I think you'd normally see.

So... having never played the game before, I think a two minute rules explanation was probably not enough preparation for the draft. I had no clue what I was doing during the draft and/or deck construction. Luckily they put me up against another person who had just learned the game. Even so, I still got my butt handed to me two out of three times.

I get the feeling that the main fun here is probably the drafting phase, where you're making interesting choices about how to build your deck. Once you create a deck, the play is fairly straightforward and comes down to dealing best with what you draw... something that probably doesn't take too long to pick up fairly well.

I played it a few times, way back when, but never truly got into the world and meta.

The mechanics are very good, but the collectible model is cruel, specially for those wanting to play in more serious competitions.

If you are new to Magic the Gathering or just looking to expand your collection or build a cube I can put together a nice collection of cards for you.  Something like 1000, 1200, or 1500 common and uncommon cards with 20-50 rares and a few foil cards as well.  I'll make sure you get a nice balance of colors, spells and card types and no more than 2 or 4 of each card.  Exact numbers of cards depends on what kind of trade we are able to work out, but if your interested let me know and we can try to put something together.

Este es el abuelo del género de los juegos de cartas coleccionables (o CCG). Las tarjetas se clasifican como común, raro, raro, raro y mítica. Los jugadores acumulan cartas y construir cubiertas de su colección.

Los jugadores construyen una baraja de cartas y el duelo contra el mazo de un oponente. El primer jugador para reducir su oponente a 0 vidas (o conoce a otro conjunto condición de victoria), gana el juego.

construcción de la cubierta es importante parte del juego. Hay más de 17.000 tarjetas diferentes desde la que construir su cubierta!

Los jugadores sacan al azar hechizos para ver lo que consiguen y pueden jugar cada turno. Aunque esto limita sus opciones, hay un montón de estrategia en la forma de jugar los hechizos. Una lista robusta de la mecánica de juego, incluyendo reglas complejas para el juego tarjeta de reactivos llamados "la pila", prevé tácticas ricos y decisiones difíciles en cada turno.

The main negative, which is huge, is its collectible nature, with certain cards going for astronomical amounts.

I guess this is really a rating of my desire to "live the life".  Magic is a fine game, I had fun playing it, but the tournaments are just freaking ridiculous.  Give me L5R any day

The game itself as I knew it would probably rate a 6, but who knows how much its changed in the decade since I played

RATING: 4.5
An extremely influential and well-designed game that has no play configuration that I enjoy:

* Deckbuilding -- too much of a money and time sink, plus a constant treadmill, so you can't just do it a bit.

* Drafting -- ok evening's entertainment, but too many of the "special" cards are ineffective in such small numbers and without the ability to really design a deck around them.

* Preconstructed -- close, but just not interesting enough, given the unwillingness of Wizards to put in enough special cards to make the decks really distinctive and interesting in terms of different play options.

Somewhere between Preconstructed and Drafting, a box that you could buy with, say, 1000 cards for 2-4 players with enough scope for some deck design but not so many cards that your head just spins, would be nice (and would boost my rating to at least 7 or 8).

Sure, the economics of CCGs stink, and the groupthink of netdecking is lame, but the balance, complexity and creativity available in Magic is unrivalled.  There are plenty of ways to play cheaply, too, as long as you don't want to win tournaments.  Creative deckbuilding is incredibly fun, and unlike anything else in gaming.  That said, I have no interest in playing anymore....

I got into Magic around 1994-95 and played it quite extensively until I quit on 1999. I kept a boxful of cards, and not until just recently I suddenly felt a strong urge to play again - just to do some simple drafts or something with my wife. To my surprise, she has found the game tremendously exciting as well. I can't wait to teach her all the different aspects of the game!

RATING: 7.5
Good:
-New cards all the time
-Drafting (Magic at it's best)
-A quality format for 2, 4, 5, and 6 players
-Cool card interactions
-Combat ticks
-Bluffing
-Having the ability to draw nothing but mana

Bad:
-Drawing nothing but mana
-"The Stack" and complex interactions
-Too many phases
-A library of keywords
-Keeping up with meta game

Overall:
First things first, if you have be in a boost draft, you have not experience the best Magic has to offer.  If you are willing to commit to the game, you will find an incredibly rewarding experience that is as hard to master as it is to leave.  Eventually, you'll be cognizant of how much money you've spent, conflicted by amount of time the hobby is consuming, and struggling to store all the cards you've collected.  At this point, you should probably look into the Cube variant so you can continue enjoying this great game without any guilt.

I know my cousin (nodens77) loves Magic... but i hate it! Lol... It seems overly complicated to me, many expansions, many strategies, i give you that is very versatile... but i believe it´s too expensive to keep up with the game. (Though, trading cards is fun... actually i prefered trading than playing LOL) This can all be because i have a Magic Aprraise discapability... but i don´t really have fun playing the game.

I've never owned any Magic cards - though I did own the Microprose PC game a few years back, and I played that to death. I think the people marking the game down are either jealous of its impact on boardgames (and I'd rather play Magic than the immensely over-rated boardgames like Settlers of Catan or Memoir '44 or Puerto Rico etc.)or else are somehow in a moral panic that a collectible card game encourages people to - I can hardly bring myself to say it - collect cards. Shock. And since only 4 of each card are allowed in a deck you can't "buy victory". If the cards you choose for your deck are poor ones or don't interact or you just don't have a grasp of the strategy then you won't win.

My god, why am I getting all worked up about a game I don't even own?

RATING: 4
I've played Magic for years and the logged number of plays doesn't reflect the amount of Magic I've played. I've played it all from competitive to casual EDH; cube to battlebox.

Battlebox is the best format I've ever played. Even better than cube!

What is Battlebox you ask? It's also called Wizard's Tower. It's a stack of cards made from all 5 colours including artifacts and multicoloured. Players have a land stack each of 1 of every basic land and 1 of each allied coloured tap-land. Both players start with a hand of 4 cards. On a player's turn, they can play a land from their land pile; otherwise it plays exactly like a normal game of magic. 

What makes this format interesting is the decision in playing the lands based on the cards in your hand. You have a maximum number of 10 lands, access to 3 of the same colour at most and for you to have access to 2 of the same colour, you have to play a tap land at some point.

The point of this format is to reduce the number of games where you simply lose to either mana flood or mana screw. Along with the relatively low power of the cards, it leads to games of attrition. It also awards players who can read their opponents making it one of the most skill intensive formats that exists in Magic.

I'm not sure if the hate for Magic is warranted here on the geek, but unfortunately it is there (though the complaints about it being expensive are warranted!). If people realised how much is taken from Magic, and how huge it's influence has been on so many games, I think people would see Magic in a different light. Think about it; the whole deck building genre was highly influenced by Magic and also the drafting mechanic.

Update: I've grown tired of the variance in Magic. Not only this, but none of the questions the game poses are particularly interesting and the majority of the decisions made in game aren't all that difficult. If you play competitively you're preparing for the fringe scenarios and making metagame calls (pick the right deck and hope to dodge all your bad matchups). Dropped this down from a 9 to a 7. I'm bored of Battlebox as well as there's too many games where it's up to the draw (I knew this going in, and I think the fact that there's no mana flood/screw, it amplifies the effect of the luck of the draw). Cube can be much the same, and drafting comes down to the battle of who takes the best blue cards as noone wants to draft the red deck. Boring.

Update 25/08/15 Rating dropped to a 4.

There's no other game on the Geek more unfairly stereotyped than this one. You've heard it all before - money pit, richest man wins, no skill, whiny teenagers, etc. As with many stereotypes, there's a grain of truth to these - you [i]can[/i] spend thousands of dollars a year chasing the latest hot cardboard in order to win a few sweaty tourneys at the local shop. 

But that's your choice - the game itself is incredibly adaptable to different playstyles, opponents, interests, and budgets. If you want a great deck-building game for the cost of, say, Dominion plus expansions, you can do it with Magic and do it better. If you want sets of preconstructed decks a la Blue Moon, Magic has plenty of choices at less than $10/deck. If you need to stay on a budget, you can easily find simple deck restrictions (e.g. limit rares to two copies or commons/uncommons only) that drastically cut costs but still give you tremendous creative opportunities. If you want multiplayer mayhem (or maybe a more subtle game of shifting alliances), the game rules accomodate such variants with ease. Obviously, if you like collecting stuff Magic provides a limitless well there. But less obviously, you can easily find subsets of the game (e.g. specific blocks or creature types) that are fulfilling to collect without eating into your kids' college funds. And sure... if you want a serious, competitive, lifestyle game, you can invest substantial time and money into assembling tournament-caliber decks. But that's just one of the alternatives.

Regardless of how you play, you'll get to enjoy one of the finer games around. Even just playing with precons there's a non-trivial amount of skill required to play a deck well, and deckbuilding opens up a huge world of additional considerations. And it all plays out in what, by boardgame standards, is a very economical timeframe. You can sit down with an opponent and bang out a 2-out-of-3 match in 20-40 minutes, with no setup time and more interesting events and decisions per minute than any boardgame I've played that fits that timeframe. I wouldn't claim that Magic is the deepest game ever created. Even the decisions in an excellent match won't stack up to those in gaming titans like 18XX, ASL, or Go. But, compared to those, Magic is much more playable, accessible, and - in certain ways - just less work and more fun.

There's no doubt that Magic: The Gathering is the mother of all card games, and I think everyone should play it. I love it to death. But it can get expensive. And mana drought and mana flood will always be a thing. 

Still, it's beautiful, and if you're looking to get into card games, start with Magic. There's just too much to say about it. I have a tattoo in dedication to it, even it it's not my favorite card game, just because it's had that much of an impact to my life.

I was a Magic junkie for a couple years back in middle and high school, which means WotC was able to sucker me out of a *hell* of a lot of allowance money.  I'll don't play regularly anymore, will never buy another card, and would actually recommend that prospective gamers stay away, just because it can be so expensive (both time and money).  I still rate it highly, because I do appreciate its innovation both in marketing and gameplay.  And, it can be a deep and rewarding system to game in if your wallet's fat enough.

M:tG is a fantastic game that I played for years through middle school and high school. I still play it occasionally, but the cost is prohibitive to do more than buy a theme deck or a few boosters once in a while. Still, my wife likes the game fairly well too, so that's a plus.

I don't consider deck building to be a part of the game, since you are not actually building your deck during the game, so it annoys me when people say all the fun of the game is in building your deck. I can build my own deck in Dominion without flushing my entire life's savings down the toilet.  This is an okay game with starter packs, but still not something I would ever choose to play in a million years. I would pick Yomi or Summoner Wars any day over this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The core game of Magic: the Gathering is brilliant.  It really is.  Magic and Netrunner alone are proof that Richard Garfield is perhaps the greatest game designer living today.

The problem comes in with the collectibility of it.  There are mountains of expansions out there and literally thousands of cards to acquire.  This presents the obvious financial problem, but there's also the preparation problem - assembling a playable deck out of those thousands and thousands of cards takes time.  A LOT of time if you want to do it well.

Obviously, restricting the format helps - you can only use cards from one set or a small handful of sets.  However, that still takes a ton of time because you begin to introduce a "metagame" - you have to gauge what others will be playing and plan against that (and they could be playing anything), and you also need to test.  Or else consign yourself to losing badly in tournaments.

For me, Magic is most enjoyable in a sealed environment - sealed deck or booster draft - since all you have to worry about are the cards at hand.  I also enjoy playing Magic with preconstructed decks, where you just grab decks out of your deck box and play.  

This obviously precludes me from pretty much all constructed Magic tournaments and thus prevents me from playing against the highest levels of competition.  However, it's still quite fun, a lot less expensive, and doesn't function as a black hole of time.

If you want to taste Magic in a very enjoyable and simple fashion, check out the Planechase decks.  Pick up two of them and play them with your friends.  For a great game, that's all you'll ever need.

The only complaint I ever hear about Magic is that it is "Too expensive" but this complaint comes from players who are trying to build hyper competitive tournament decks. When it comes to casual kitchen table play, the game is actually very affordable compared to most LCG or Deckbuilding games, and tons of fun. There are seemingly limitless ways to enjoy playing Magic. My personal favorite is a cube that I have built so my friends and I can get together, draft, build decks, and play them any time and have a different experience each time, all for about a single $20 investment. If you haven't tried Magic, you should!

people often only state the things they perceive as having been "done wrong" in Magic.  unfortunately, most CCG's missed the important things that were done right.

people complain that the cards have gotten too powerful-  and i say you build a deck with what you believe is the most overpowered recent set, let me build a deck with just the original set, moxes, black lotus, dual lands, swords to plowshares, timewalk, etc.  

people say that the game is too expensive. if you're good enough at the game, the only cost is tournament fees- you win more than enough product to keep you playing competitively.

What really happens is that people's perceptions change- and they are inaccurate... either misinformed or tainted with nostalgia.

I started collecting from the early days but always struggled to find opponents, so playing this game didn't really take off for me until I started Uni. Once bitten I was hooked and I swear I spent more time playing this than studying, drinking or indulging in any of the other usual student pursuits.  

It's very portable, quick to play and if your friends aren't already into it then your FLGS will likely provide a healthy supply of opponents.  And there is always deck design to fill those long, lonely evenings...  Can become a lifestyle choice rather than a game after a while, you have been warned.

I've started to really like playing "Magic".  The collectable nature of the game is a two-edged sword.  It keeps the game fresh, but also encourages players to spend a large amount of money on the game over time.  Because of this, I can't make myself give Magic a rating of 10. The collectable issue aside, I really enjoy draft formats.  It almost feels like the draft is itself a separate "bonus" game you get to play before testing your decks in an actual duel.  For a good time, buy a draft box ($$$) and invite over seven of your best friends for a booster draft tournament.

I gave up years ago on throwing real money after this game, which cynics would characterize more a money-making scheme than a game. These days I only maintain a pauper (commons only) collection: It is cheap, fun, and an eternal format where your cards never rotate out.

I no longer have the thousands of cards I accumulated in the late '90s. For a while in 2009-10 I played online in commons-only Pauper format. It's a surprisingly varied and robust metagame at about $10 for a deck. MTGO means new opponents available to play at the drop of a hat.

I will love this forever. It is not perfect - far from it - and I'm not buying cards anymore (stop trying to trick me, Wizards), but maybe I will come back to online playing or to homemade cube drafts. What this game has managed to achieve during the Scars of Mirrodin block is just what every gamer should dream - and probably has dreamt - of.

Also, anyone who is blaming a game for its monetary costs can just play it online, or with proxies, or limited (and limited is, in my opinion, the only format embodying the original "spirit" of Magic)

There are newer, more elegant duelling games (Star Wars Destiny comes to mind). Magic is not the easiest game to get into although this depends on the local scene. The main reason I play MtG is a practical one - with a game this big, you can always find players. Still, there's a reason MtG has stood the test of time - it is still incredibly good for a 90s game, the variability is huge and I love the deckbuilding aspect.

Most played game. Almost every Friday at FNM a draft, sometimes Saturday a Standard Showdown. Sometimes sealed.

This is not a board game, this is a series of poor life choices in cardboard form.  

Had to get out after many years.  Spending 30$ on one card from ebay made me think about life.  And now that card goes for $120... Can't keep up with the value swings, can't keep investing time and time again just to have shit become obsolete.  

I like it.  I'm keeping my old decks... there are a few I'd like to finish, but... man... The rabbit hole is SO deep...

I enjoy the game still, but they have changed the rules too much for me and some of my favorite decks have become obsolete because of those rule changes. I also don’t want to continue to spend money on decks that are for me. I can spend just as much money it seems and get a game that several people can play. But I will play if given the opportunity. But several friends of mine share my opinions even more strongly.

(sigh) I wish I were a better MtG player... I like that it is composed of both away-from-table and at-table portions; ie, it's fun to construct a deck in your own time, then bring it out among your friends and see how it fares. But when it comes to the tournament play... if you aren't up on the latest additions or know the cards intimately, you will get smoked!

I've had an on again, off again relationship with Magic. Years ago I would have rated this higher, as it is a very fun game, and tweaking decks is a real challenge. However, CCGs are just too expensive to stay in.

Update: After playing a few games again, I'd forgotten how much fun this game is, in particular, the deck building. Since discovering board games, I've had my nose turned up a little at CCGs, although I've been trying other CCGs on the cheap (WoW, Vs). However, the deck building seems more directed by 'class choice' in those games and the combos aren't as interesting. If only Magic didn't have the mana screw problem!

Update: I've put together a draft cube and had amazing fun playing a 7 player draft! It takes a long time but is certainly a great experience. I'm really enjoying getting back into a bit of Magic. If you treat the tournament as one long game, the mana screw problem seems like just part of the game.

Great game to get into, hard though as it is an investment. 
Modern sets are just using the same mechanics but calling them something else. There are only so many things you can call "give a +1/+1 counter" before it gets boring. 

Keep releasing old cards I invested in that really downgrade the value.

Positive sides:

2) It is always great when many unexpected things happen, many interrupts and instants!

Negative sides:
1) Too many expansions have made the game far too unbalanced.
2) The trading value has killed the game and ripped its formerly so bright soul out.
However, it do not get a top rating because it is unbalanced, due to the totally too many expansions around and

The best CCG I have played.  I like Magic: The Gathering a lot.  I think that it is a very well crafted concept-become-game.  Although not the first CCG, it is the biggest by far and longest (and strongest) running with no end in sight.  The colors work well as the basics for philosophic deckbuilding, and the brilliant card designs breathe life into combinations and machinations that you design.  Would be ranked much higher if it were NOT a CCG.  I hate spending money every year to replace cards that I already have just to stay current in the tournament block.  Will give massive bonus points to the person who originally thought of the idea of a trading card game with endless expansions that are almost mandatory in order to keep playing, whoever that may be.

I was shown this game shortly after the fourth edition came out and I could see what a good game it was. What I couldn't see was the money pit that any collectible game would be. I also never found anyone to play with - the fantasy theming is a big turn off with everyone in my family except me. In the end I completed my collection of the fourth edition and then stopped. A good game though.

I was hooked years ago, got out when the Ice Age set came out.  Now I have some cards to make a casual deck from time to time.  

Recently started teaching my kids how to play, it's fun being reintroduced to the game.

Mostly Commons, very few Rares, nothing worth collecting, 90% of the cards are hand me downs from friends to casually enjoy.

Maybe not the best CCG, but damn close if it isn't.  It's easy to pooh-pooh Magic, but there's a neverending, nationwide community of dedicated players that plays every week, and has done so for more than 25 years.  I can name on two hands the number of other games that meet that criteria.

It can be a terrible money sink if you're not careful.  There was a six-month span of my teenage life where this had 90% of my disposable income, but to be fair, it also had close to 90% of my disposable time.  I eventually got frustrated when I realized that the cards were getting wildly more powerful, and an increasing percentage of my collection was becoming irrelevant in even casual play.  I got out of the game at that point and don't see myself ever getting seriously back into it.

That said, a lot has happened since I got out of this around the Invasion block in 2000.  The decks and cards that exist now are much more powerful than what I played with in the 90s.  Even a passable deck would shred any deck I made back in the day.  There's a lot more strategic space to explore in both tournament and casual play, especially with the reintroduction and effectiveness of multicolor strategies.  More rare cards have interesting effects that can drive a game in different directions, so it doesn't come down to "creature, counter, burn spell" as much any more.

If you hand me a deck, I'll play it again for nostalgia's sake.  Even better, if you give me an hour or so with your collection, I'll make a blue deck that probably doesn't work very well, but is a lot of fun to play.  And then I'll play you and regale you with the halcyon days when I used to play this, and about how the hobby is spoiled now.  Get off my lawn!

This game has such marvelous tactical nuance, it's a shame that I burned out trying to find players with the right level of skill and competitiveness.  Building decks is a tremendous imaginative exercise, and the tactical turn-by-turn play is intersting and deep, but the game ultimately goes to those with large collections, and the amount of time I really have available to comb through the collection and build decks has dwindled to approximately nothing since I became a dad.  I still love to play sealed deck or precons, but that's about it.

Played my very first game 2/9/13. Used my new Dimir Dementia deck I just bought and won without losing any damage, creature or otherwise. 
Enjoyed my first couple games, but playing versus someone who has much more experience and/or spent more money on deck building, or is even using someone else's deck (someone much more experienced at deck building) has made the game much less fun for me. We'll see how it goes though.
Played two more games and had a much better time. Since they opponent used their own deck this time.

RATING: 7
The first and biggest of the CCGs, and the only one I still play occasionally.  I don't really collect it much anymore though.  The set rotations, powercreep, and focus on the tournament scene pretty much killed me as a customer.  (Though, sure, I can't deny the tournament scene is probably a large part of what's kept the game selling for twenty years.)  The majority of cards I have are from the small horde I amassed during the game's first couple years, and I've added only a handful of newer cards to that in the last two decades.

Still, if you can avoid the tournament scene and the more cutthroat play, this can be a pretty decent game - fun, fast, easy to teach, easy to transport, and with some really cool art.

For those handful that haven't played this CCG, there's a reason it's still going strong after 20 years. The gameplay itself is surprisingly easy to pick up, most of the strategy is in the deck building. The themes and flavour of the cards are well thought out and the artwork is superb. Just a well-rounded game. Just be prepared to spend a lot of money on it if you want to get into it properly.

8 plays recently with old cards and old deck. Nice game, but might be hard to teach to new players.

I've heard there are playable starter decks nowadays, but I think you still need to know your deck, before you can properly play.

I own 2 intro decks.  $40.  So for $40 the game seems OK but has little to no replay-ability, the rules were poorly written, heaps of questions and was a bit imbalanced.  Now for $1000 I imagine you could pick up a really nice game with quite a bit of replay-ability but when I could purchase a great game already for $50-$100 why would I do this.  Disappointed!

RATING: 9.5
Fun and addictive! (And potentially very, very expensive.) However, since I played Magic almost exclusively for several years, I don't have the same urge to play it these days. If you asked me twelve years ago, I would have rated it 10. 

UPDATE: 20th of July, 2011: Rating changed to '9' because of the Commander (EDH) format and the preconstructed Commander decks. 

UPDATE: 23rd September, 2011: I'm completely hooked. 

UPDATE: 9th January, 2012: I have started going to tournaments and ordering incredibly expensive cards. My spiral into addiction is complete. 

UPDATE: 10th August, 2015: I'm still hooked.

I got sucked into this for a short time - fortunately I managed to escape with at least some of my savings intact. The cynical mechanism of CCG's monetary arms race or being able to spend your way to victory does not justify Magic's fairly average gameplay. Remember kids:  MTG CCG - JUST SAY NO!

Magic is a fun game, well if both sides are balanced. When playing as a CCG and not using pre-built equally matched decks the fun goes way down. I will always say yes to a game so long as both sides have an equal chance to win.

Best game there is for me. Magic is what got me away from gaming on my computer to play with others. Magic is a seemingly endless pit of game variants and replay-ability. It is deckbuilding, drafting, hand management, resource management and so much more that you now find in "boutique" boardgames. And it keeps evolving. Now that coop is a thing, we get Hydra and can play Magic coop and solo! Enough drooling - this is an ingenious invention of a past time, but an insanely expensive hobby if you get really  into it, so I am glad that I find no one to play with.

I have swapped to playing Hearthstone (a result of more easily finding opponents).
Note: by Magic I mean playing (preferably highlander) sealed or draft, from one person's collection (to avoid richest person wins). The positives are good card stock, lovely artwork, and spell interaction.
[i]Unfortunately, WotC have a tendency to compromise the game, to sell more - so much so that there are no new cards that I want to buy.[/i]

Lagoon and Evolution make it less likely that I will want to play Magic. I haven't played Magic in over a year.

You can't really rate Magic, it bases on how you play it and the local community. Though to be honest the mechanics earns the 9. If you ahve a problem with tradeablity, just think away it and then the mecahnics is still good.

The price is a huge barrier to entry if you want to play tournament constructed Magic. Fortunately, there are other ways to enjoy this tremendous game. You can play with friends on Magic Workstation for free, or you can spend 15$ a week drafting at an FNM. While 15$ a week sounds like a lot, if you can become good enough to consistently win prizes, the effective price is actually much lower once you sell back the cards you win.

Whatever the case, if you have infinite money this game is pretty much infinite fun. If you don't, it's still pretty freaking awesome.

RATING: 8.5
Probably the best TCG of all times... only downside... It's so damn expensive... I remember that the game used to be "cheap" around $100 for a tier 1 deck, now is at least $200 to $350 and if it's modern, even more (from 600 to over $1000).

BTW, I own several decks and expend way more money than I should in this game.

The grandaddy of them all, the origin of cardboard crack, the game that brought a million gamers out of their hidey holes. Nice cards with great art, clear reminder text, and yes, it's still collectible and the rares are both expensive and necessary to compete. Of course Wizards of the Coast gets a free pass here, as they both invented the CCG niche and stimulated it's growth through the Pro Tour scene.

Magic has always had strong mechanics. Games without them don't last more than a couple of printings, and Magic has been around for fifteen years. It's a great game, but it does suffer from being the first of its kind. Many systems it employs have been corrected and improved by newer games. For example, Magic's resource system keeps players from simply using all the best cards from all the colors. While that is certainly necessary for game balance, it also can lead to long stretches where a player cannot play any cards at all. The combat system also feels a little dated, as there is very little decision making. Simply decide who attacks, then send them all. There is nothing truly wrong with Magic, I just think that many modern card game systems tend to handle these issues a little better. It's still a great game, just no longer the best.

When Magic hysteria first broke onto the scene, there were absolutely no cards available anywhere. By the time cards were somewhat available again, I had somehow managed to stumble into the Star Wars CCG which had come out shortly after. I certainly couldn't afford to play two collectible games; so most of my Magic experience has been with borrowed decks, which is always difficult in a CCG. It never really grabbed me enough to buy in, and now I think other games have improved the formula so much that Magic just feels archaic. It's the three hundred pound gorilla though, so I do manage a game here and there. Magic the Gathering is almost as universal among gamers as D&D and Mountain Dew, so it pays to know how to play...

RATING: 5
I like the mechanics of this, but ultimately it's unsatisfying due to the arms race. The thing that bothers me most about a game like chess, for example, is that it's not really a contest if one player has invested significantly more time than the other. Magic is worse, because the key factor is often money instead of time. This is not to say the game is devoid of strategy, but the bottom line is it's extremely difficult to defeat a $200 deck with a $20 deck. There are ways around this, of course, and I really enjoy drafting in particular, but unless you have a group of people who are willing to stick to whatever budget you set, it will not work long term, and I would much rather buy a game that I can play a dozen times than booster draft 5-6 times.

Edit: All the stuff I said above still stands, but I dropped my rating to a 5 for a couple of reasons. First, I'm becoming increasingly annoyed that Wizards intentionally prints bad (or "weaker") cards in the sets to pad them out. I played 6 games in a Swiss draft last night, and lost 3 of them solely because of one card my opponent pulled (not a combo, just a single card that was better than anything I saw). Beyond that, playing Duels of the Planeswalkers made me realize that, not only is there no mechanism to mitigate a bad draw, but that the order your cards come up is more important than how you play them. That's not to say that deckbuilding is not key, but there are other CCGs where the mana system is less clunky (or non-existent).

The father and king of all collectible card games out there. My affair with Magic has been on again, off again but now I feel that it's definitely off. I respect a game which has managed to stay in peak for 15 years now but let's be honest; to stay competitive in this game you have to spend vast amounts of money. And exactly because I'm very much into boardgames, there is no way to hold both melons under the same arm. It's either Magic or boardgames and for me it's boardgames.

Got an M13 Intro Pack, Deck Builder's Toolkits, and the best part... :)

Rated Revised an 8 because the Power 9 had been removed. Also, the designers of the game back then were concerned about the game being too powerful and purposely made "weak" sets.

I won't buy any more cards, but since I have a few mediocre decks put together, I would be ok with playing this with friends who have also quit the habit and are just working with whatever cards they still had around. I guess I could use it as a gateway to introduce non-collectible games, if it came down to it.

Rated based on the small likelihood of me playing again at some point and the inability to improve in the game without buying new cards. Also considered the fact that I'm probably not familiar with 95% of the new mechanics since I stopped playing years ago, so playing against someone who has kept up with the times would basically involve me learning a new game.

I didn't factor in the amount of money I spent on cards I'll never use.

I've only dabbled in MtG, but I mostly like it. Not even close to being worth the expense, though. Deck-building is *by far* the more interesting part of the game, with gameplay itself mostly done by rote: hey, neat, I drew the cards I'd hoped/planned to. Some other CCGs (INWO, MECCG, and esp. Netrunner) have in-game decisions as a far more significant factor.  (Note that after playing Dominion's "introductory" configuration, gameplay in Magic seems positively fascinating.  That is not a compliment to either game.)

Also, the Land concept is weak, as Garfield himself acknowledged.  Why have up to 40% of your deck devoted to something so uninteresting?  Add to that mana screw and it's just frustrating to imagine what might have been.

I broke my cardboard crack habit long ago from this game but still enjoy it in the form of pre-con decks.  Unfortunately, Wizards has announced they are doing away with this format no doubt as it doesn't generate the money compared to the random packs.  The beauty of the pre-con decks are the fact that they are not (in a sense) collectible.  For the most part, they work well against each other and there's the fun of learning how to play each deck to its full potential.  Well I guess it's time to get my hands on a few more pre-con decks while they're still around.  Let's face it, MtG is still the single best CCG out there and IMHO will always be #1.  I just won't deal with the collectible aspect of it anymore.  As far as Wizards doing away with pre-con decks, too bad for them.  It's less of my money they'll get.  Hopefully they'll come out with something similar to them that's also just as fun and doesn't require chasing the holy grail rare cards.

This game has immense variety, so at the most introductory level, there is a fairly shallow learning curve, however the full rules can become very complex. There are many robustly supported formats of play and it is quite enjoyable even at lower-complexity levels.

This started with the Elves vs. Goblins Duel deck I got for Christmas a few years back.  My wife and I tried playing a few times, and unfortunately those decks seemed to present very few choices during the actual game play (I need to revisit that deck).  What I recognized though is that 60% of the game is in constructing your deck.
After that I've gotten quite a few more cards to add to my collection.  I started playing at work using a co-workers cube that he constructed.  He has introduced me to drafts and I really enjoyed the game after!

Draft is the only way to go for me with this game.  I used to play drafts mainly at work, but I do a weekly constructed game with my brother-in-law once a week.  Draft is much more fun as, like I said, actually building the deck is 60% of the game.  So making it a part of the game with a draft enhances the game greatly for me.

If you can look past its "randomized/collectible" element (which simultaneously the game's greatest strength and most crippling frustration), you'll find a surprisingly enjoyable and strategic dueling game. It is incredibly easy to learn, features almost limitless variety, often plays in under 30 minutes and yet features the potential for very deep strategy.

My advice: don't waste money on randomized booster packs (unless you like that sort of thing). You can buy complete sets of cards (especially if you focus on just the no-less-powerful common/uncommon cards) for a *FRACTION* of the cost and know that you are getting a huge variety (and value) from many web-retailers and eBay.

Obscenely Complex.
But a "game" that pays you regally for getting over the barrier to entry.

I say "game", in quotes, because it is actually a collection of many different games.  There are many different types of people that would enjoy a different part of the game.  

I've been playing off and on since 1994, and expect to continue to play it well into the future.

As i was already sure, it's not my kind of game. Too many texts, too many terms and exceptions even if the rules aren't so difficult. It's too chaotic, one single card can have such a disruptive effect that everything seems plainly random.
On the other hand, i like the fact that every game is different and you can use a lot of fantasy to better manage your hand and your deck.
I don't think i want to play it again because to savour it you first have to know too many cards well enough.... but i can understand why so many people like this.

I don't like the fact that you have to spend more money to be stronger

I’m not wild about collectible card games, and Magic is a big reason for it. It’s a fine game, but I purposefully avoid any game that has a collectible aspect. Beyond that, the game feels very mechanical, like every card is a set of numbers and not much else. That’s okay I guess, but I’d rather play something else.

Not recommended.

The game that got the hobby started for me.  I played competitive Magic for about four and a half years.  I started my collection a couple years before that with boosters of Revised out of my allowance.  My meager play count on this site doesn’t reflect the thousands or tens of thousands of plays in my youth.  

I’m not sure what I can say that others haven’t.  It’s a novel concept for a product model that happened to also be a brilliant game.  I don’t regret a moment of my Magic days, though I rarely play anymore.  I met so many interesting and intelligent people playing tournament Magic many of whom I keep up with to this day.  I still can talk for hours on end about the evolution and development of the game.

If I had the time to commit to building decks, reading on the game, etc; it's likely I would rate it higher. As-in, my plays are limited to pre-built decks and my limited plays still create rules confusion. Not a bad game but I'd rather spend time playing something like the AGoT or LotR LCGs.

I got in on Magic just at the end of the Beta run, and had a ton of Unlimited (most of my good cards).  I collected Arabian Nights, Antiquities, The Dark, Legends, Ice Age, Fallen Empires and Homelands.  I used to play for ante, as was in the rules, and I recall winning 2 Moxes that way.  I also have the distinction of trading 10 Urza's Chalice for a Black Lotus.  At one point I had all of the Power Nine cards, multiple copies of some.  I still have enough cards to play if I ever wanted to but I sold off my valuable cards.  This was a revolutionary game, and I don't think there has been a CCG/TCG/LCG to come out with a better system.  There are way too many cards now, but it was great to be on the ground floor back in the day.

RATING: 8
Avoid the collectible aspect as much as you can, avoid competitive play, and you're on the safe side - and ready for a vastly enjoyable experience.

Here's how I do it. I own 18 of the "Intro Packs" for the game published since 2009. These are premade decks, roughly balanced to each other. I meet with friends to play Magic, each of us picks one of these 18 sets, and then have a go at each other. Individual plays last 15 minutes at most, so you can fit in many plays in one session, and pick different 'packs' in each new play.

The key is - buy these Intro Packs, and don't ever adjust (aka 'pimp') them by buying high powered rare cards on Ebay. That way the decks stay balanced to each other, and brain (as opposed to: wallet) power is the decisive factor in scoring a victory.

Actually, what inspired me to go about the game in this way was
1. the warning I got from people who burned out on the game because of the collectible+tournament aspects
2. the LCG format introduced by FFG for its card games. Brought home to me that Magic may as well be *best* enjoyed as a 'game out of the box'.

Probably the best game ever made. Constantly developing with very transparent developers. I've played this game for ten or so years by now, and I am still getting more and more enthusiastic about it.

Can be a 2-player abstract card trading game, or a multi-player game for 3 or more players. There are a few formats to be played with players you may or not known. Formats like Commander, Standard, Modern, Legacy, Vintage. This game can take you a long-period of time to understand the basic rules of the game, and it takes you more time to design a deck that best fit you for a game or two. Best recommend for deck building players who love deck building mechanics.

Having played this game to a very high level of competition and very close its release, I believe I'm one of few people who can give a very good review of the game. I first started in 1994 and up until about 2002, I had spent about $20,000 on it, had participated in hundreds of drafts/sealeds and qualified for many pro tour events and national chamionships.

The short version is this, the game WAS fantastic and I would have ranked it about 9/10, the highest score I would have given anything. Now it deserves no more than 6, due to greed and dilution.

If you're just starting to play this game, I strongly suggest you play it for free over the internet or borrow someone else's cards. This is a rich man's hobby if you wish to even have a shot at anything competitive. I have no comment on what it's like as a casual game.

Magic CAN BE a great game. Making your own duel decks or draft cube makes for solid gameplay, and these can be affordable, and have decent replay value. But, as an MTG player for more than 10 years, the game can also be awful. Broken mechanics and $2000 decks make for an inaccessible and less-than-fun environment much of the time.

Played lots of time in the nineties. The CCG concept is great and offers huge possibilities, and MtG was enjoyable, both in deck building and in actual gameplay.

Garfield is rightly famous for inventing the CCG system. It was a breakthrough when it was new, and WOTC has done an amazing job of keeping it interesting by inventing interesting new cards for the system.

That being said, most games I play end up annoying me. The main killer is the amount of luck in drawing the right amount of land and the right cards at the right time; so many games are decided by one player drawing too much or too little land. With slightly better mechanics this could be incredible, but as it stands I'd rather play something else.

I played several times with my nephews who were into it and came to visit.  Gorgeous artwork on cards but otherwise not my favorite.

RATING: 4
Like: Sifting through thousands of cards and creating a functioning deck from scrap. Opening boosters.

Dislike: Playing against anyone for serious. Having 1/3 of my deck being the same card (lands), a good portion of my wins and losses are from either player drawing too much, or not enough land to play effectively.

It&#039;s a classic. As for game mechanics and originality I give it a 10. But they&#039;ve gone commercial(old cards can hardly compete with new cards) and as a game it&#039;s way to expensive. You need at least two decks for a two player game, and that&#039;s a two player game that&#039;s only fun for two or three times. There are a lot of cheaper two player games that can outlast this one. Four decks for a four player game? Settlers of catan comes cheaper and lasts longer. And even then you need more cards for an interesting game. Way to expensive. But addictive. I think I&#039;ve spend at least $600 before I quitted

Ignoring external considerations and rating purely on the game, this is clearly a 10. Massively innovative, constantly evolving, maybe even world-changing. Every card is like a jigsaw piece, but it's a piece that can fit into a million different jigsaws. There are so many different ways to play, from competitive booster draft to crazy casual multiplayer games; if you've had enough of one aspect of the game you can try another. Even deckbuilding can be a game in itself. 

Whether you're drafting the perfect deck and trouncing each opponent 2-0 for prizes, patiently constructing your game-winning play using combinations of silly cards to the amusement of the table, or just enjoying the flavour of a lovingly-constructed theme deck, it's all good. My enthusiasm for Magic waxes and wanes, but it's something I'll always come back to.

MtG is the game I've played for the longest period of time, it's the only game I've stayed up all night playing and playing and never getting bored, it's the game I've played the most times, the game I've played the most times repeatedly in one session, the game I've played with the most people, and the game I've spent the most time thinking about. It's also the game I've spent the most money on. An absurd amount of money. It has came and went from my life a few times, mostly for financial reasons, but I'm at a place in my life now where I am comfortable with how much I spend and how much I play. It's no longer an addiction, it's something that I can pick up and play at any time with endless variety and continue to find new things to love about it. I've stopped playing standard and stick mostly to Commander and Modern with the occasional draft. I love building fun casual decks and dumb combos and all the aspects of deck building. I started back during Sixth Edition and still love Magic to this day. It will always be my favorite game.

Extremely enjoyable gameplay, excellent production values, along with the broadspread market penetration and popularity of the game, matched by Wizards of the Coast's excellent support of the game has pushed it into the stratosphere and deservedly so, for years and years.  

The Mana Screw/Flood issue is really the only major gameplay flaw I can think of (if you want to call it a flaw) though some folks (myself included) find it hard to keep up with the high cost of owning the game and playing in the Standard game mode.  If only there was a cheaper version of the game or a cheaper way to still own all the cards!  One of my top 2 all-time favorite card games.  Truly a superb gaming experience in the right setting.

The only other negative would be that the community is pretty crap - full of pompous know-it-alls and quite insular, it's not something you'd ever really want or care to be a part of, imho.

I played it between 1998 and 2014 and then had no regular occasion to play.
I stopped buying it because of the new "skin" of the cards.

I could play it again if I had a regular opponent AND an agreement on the amount on money each of us spend monthly (to avoid the "arms race).

I'll play Magic anytime, anywhere, against anyone. Particularly limited formats. So I suppose it's my one true 10, even though I don't count it as my favorite game anymore. Even though I don't own any cards or have an MTGO account (thanks, 3.0, for being terrible).

As a relatively early follower, the game was interesting, but the expansions quickly made it a money pit and difficult to manage. I gave all of my cards to my brother who is still playing it.
It was fun as far as I remember, and I did not play with opponents who did not master combos or pre-built decks (I do not myself either). Adding cards is a necessary evil to renew the fun and the challenge, but it can be hard to keep up with.

I'm way late to this party, but it's truly the type of game I love. I have no interest in going deep, and an LCG is more attractive to me than a CCG, but it's still a damn solid and damn fun game to play.

But...I'm going to say it...I'd rather play Pokemon.

What is so great about Magic?
- you can play it with any number of friends.
- you can spend hours in preparation when no playing is possible.
- it is great fun to invent a deck around any idiot theme: like only with Douglas Schuler cards, only cards with babes, a deck that is to paralyse or multiplayer game.
- I like collecting.
- It was  original when Richard came up with it.

I have played Magic for a long time but everything past the original Mirrodin block has made the game incredibly convoluted. More and more special rules keep creeping out of nowhere and the card power creep is real. I will only even play this game with friends these days. Tournaments just aren't worth the effort when you have to pour hundreds of dollars every time a new release hits the shelves (which is about every 4 months). This is arguably one of the most expensive card games out there.

I like this game. If I had 4-5 friends who played weekly, I'd get back into it in a heartbeat. I don't mind the CCG model. It's a very FUN game to me when played in the right circumstances, with the right people. It's an incredibly nostalgic game to me.

The original CCG, but also probably the best.  Although unbalanced in it's original form, rule changes and card restrictions have made it one of the best in this respect.  Easy enough for beginners, quick to play, and the added fun of building a deck that's unique make this the best game I've ever played.  The cost of playing copetitively are insane compared to non-CCGs, but aside from this, I can't think of anything negative to say about the game.  Considering the thousands of hours I spent playing this when I was younger, the replay value alone justifies a perfect rating.

Gave many hundreds if not thousands of $$ to Richard Garfield while in college.  This was during the time of UL - IA.  Once I got married, MtG fell out of favor; however, I have been collecting some cards to play casually with my wife as well as daubing in MtGOnline.

This is the grandfather of all CCG's and IMO, very well done.  This seems kind of obvious since even after 20  years, the game is still around while others have melted into obscurity.  The theme is great as are the myriad of cards - over 15000 to choose from, at least in casual play.

Concerns are the same with any collectable game - ultimately the game is unbalanced.  It must be  in order to drive new card sales.  Second, you can sink a ton of money into this game.  And third, you need to have a willing opponent to either use their own deck or one you have made.  Getting balanced decks takes playtime and playtesting.  Time which could be used playing other games.

Definitely the game I've played the most over the years, the plays here are not half of it. I am not very interested in constructed play any more and prefer limited. 

I am not currently playing Magic, I think it's a great game still but I decided to focus on games in general rather than keeping up with this one. It is a huge hog on time and money to stay up to date with which is fine if this your game/ lifestyle choice but I have decided to diversify and look to the wider hobby of board games.

Damn difficult to rate, this one. It's a very good game, but while it is possible to play enjoyably without spending much money, it's not easy.

I'd advise you to avoid it, really, but I can't bring myself to rate it any lower, because it is basically a pretty good game.

This is one that's tough to rate...I started playing in '94 and let me tell you I LOVED it.  Ran all around the east coast trying to find a shop that sold the cards, spent way too much money on (needless to say).  Got out when the expansions made it clear that there was no way to have a really representative collection--there were just too many cards.  Now things are even more out of hand.  I sold most of my cards on ebay recently and made about $1,500.  whoo!

Thanks for the memories. 

I recently had to update this entry due to the release of the Planeswalkers expansion. WTF? How does this not destroy the mechanics of the game? It basically puts Vanguard cards into the actual set. Mythic Rares? Are you serious?

Finally dropped this rating down to a 1. This game is basically broken beyond repair and I feel that the collectible aspects and tournament game play have finally driven the final nail into the coffin of this once great franchise. Let's face it, this game has been in a downward spiral since Garfield left the company. The emergence of net decking and Hasbro's acquisition of WoTC didn't help the matter. 

It's hard to describe to new players the way that this game was before. When I say before, I mean before the color hues were changed on the cards. This new product is not MtG, although some of the original aspects do remain. I would never sell my cards but playing this game again seems impossible.

I miss the days of the Duelist and Theme Decks. 

At least MtG opened my eyes to the world outside of MtG. I heavily recommend Warhammer: Invasion to any people who are into MtG or thinking about MtG. It is a much better game, more strategy driven than money driven and it almost plays the same. 

I hate rating this a one but it's like seeing your old crush from high school on Jerry Springer. The love was once there but it is time to grow up.

[b]FREAKIN' AMAZING![/b]

Worshipped by millions, Magic justifiably resides on Mount Olympus with the other gaming supergods. Without a doubt, this is the greatest game you could ever hope to grace your table. Magic's genius-level game design is the architecture that spans over all other CCGs; they live in its long shadow.
Portable. Simple. Quick. Slow. Customisable. Beautiful. Intuitive. Elegant. Euro AND Ameritrashy. Rewarding of deep thought. Rewarding of fun, trashy play. As expensive or cheap as you make it. This is the ultimate game. Nothing comes close, sucks you in so deep, leaves you breathless, grips you vice-like, fills your brain endlessly, as Magic: The Gathering.

It took only one quick 3-minute demonstration, with a factory deck, by a venerable shopkeeper, to convince me to part with some hard-earned cash on this badass beast of a cardgame. I had no idea that this pile of card would drain my mind and life SO heavily for the next 3-4 years. Absolutely no idea.

I loved this game like a seductive large-breasted girl. Many an hour was spent honing decks and cardplay. The time investment was obviously worth it, because I won 15+ tournaments, until netdecks swept the rug from under my boots.
My favourite tourney was, without a doubt, Highlander (one of a kind card-limit).
 
I dreamed of playing this professionally. I started enjoying this game when Arabian Nights came out, and continued to play for many years after.

[b]Current Status: RETIRED.[/b]

PLEASE NOTE:
MTG is an incredible way to take the food out of your mouth and put another Ferrari on Richard Garfield's drive!

[i]To purge myself of this crack-like game I did two things - and I advise you to do the same:[/i]

STEP 1. Sell all your cards individually on eBay.
STEP 2. Buy the absolutely HUGE encyclopedia of MTG that has gazillions of cards from EVERY set. Look at this book only at midnight, and only when the pangs of deck-building start to strike.


I actually went hungry for a few days because of this game, back in the mists of time when the [i]Antiquities[/i] expansion was released, and I was broke.

I'll never put on a lifejacket again...

Ok so the game is amazing, I've had fun playing it since 2009 and I only have two slight problems with it: first if you want to compete in tournaments or events near you, you'll need to invest alot of money since the most played format is standard, and to those who don't know what that is, it is a format where only the cards from the last 3-4 blocks are allowed, and a new block is released each 3-4 months (ish) which means that cards get out of the format really quickly, you always need to update your deck according to the cards in the rotation as well as according to the current meta. My second concern is that in general, even when you don't play standard, it can still cost you somewhat a lot for just playing casually with your friends (but then again, when playing casually it's entirely up to you, it is just that I, personally, decided to invest in these cards.) Any way, if you don't play the game yet, you ought to start soon!

I have fond memories of this.  Played Magic avidly during college (when Legends and the Dark was still being sold), owned lots of the rare and treasured cards (had a set of power 9 at one time).  Still have a good number of them , but I am no longer active in collecting it (stopped around 1999 after Alliance I think).  The most funnest time I have was in multiplayer games such as 4-headed juggernaut and emperor.  Never was big into tournaments.  Recently been contemplating getting back into it, at least to give the online game a try, but it's still an awful money sink.

Magic, in my opinion, is an above average game, but there's just too much of it. Pretty much everyone knows what this game is, and while that's a good thing in some senses, I feel that it's just overplayed. The card pool is just too large, and is still growing and will probably continue to grow for the next 5 to 10 years, if not more. While the mechanics are good, I feel that by this point there are just too many of them. Plus, there are a lot of great card games out there, and ones with mechanics which feel a little stronger than the ones present here, or at least more focused. Magic is just okay. It's not bad, it's not amazing, it's just somewhere in the middle.

MTG: Magic the Gathering was my gateway game into this great hobby and for this reason, it will always hold a special place.  

Although I do not play nearly as often as I used to, I still do enjoy the game play, strategizing and deck building.  

Back in the day, I loved this game and all it had to offer.  Before the introduction of the new look, I still collected cards/sets.  Now, I dispise the new updated version.  Not only do the cards look cheap, but Wizards of the Coast began releasing too many sets too often and ruined previous sets with the rerelease of old cards.  

How many of us are guilty in giving WotC too much of our hard earned money?  I am regretfully guilty of this too.  Since, I vowed not to go overboard with collectable games and I feel I have been somewhat successful in that.

Preferred way of playing is drafting. When a new set comes out I try to draft it at least once. Also enjoy building and drafting Magic cubes (a collection of 360+ cards).

Started collecting during Unlimited.  Sold off my collection c. 1996.  Started buying theme decks in Chicago c. 2002.  Sold them on eBay c. 2005.  Now I'm off the cardboard crack and high on life.

(Though I still make proxy decks).

I used to go to tournaments. I loved it. It's so expensive. New sets are fairly 'meh'. Casual is still fun and inexpensive but requires a good understanding of the game and card knowledge to build decks and buy the individual cards online. Duel decks are ok but need beefing up. It's a good game but it's seen better days and is such a monetary commitment.

RATING: 8
While you are into the game, willing to collect cards - be they physical or virtual - and studying its strategies and interactions, this game is completely fun and addictive.  Building decks will appeal strongly to your inventive side.  It's easy to go broke if you do both real and online cards.  You can't give up the real, because they're something you can physically use.  You can't give up the virtual because online, you can play any time, purchase any time, compete in tournaments any time - you get the idea.  Much of the illustrations are rather nice, as well, just to add to the sting.

Once its tendrils loosen their grip on your soul, however, you can pretty easily lose all motivation to play any more.

What a terrific design! The CCG to end all CCGs! VERY diverse and flexible and customizable. I played at the highest tournament level for ten years and retired to play board games with my kids (they were becoming non-babies, and I am eager to pollute young minds!)
Great game with lots of possibilities. There's a reason six gazillion people play it.

Good game in right company. Basically the gamesystem is pure gold, but keeping up with all the expansions kills all the fun from the game. In right company, where it isn't played so seriously, this game rocks!

Gamers marmite, most either like or loath.  Seems to be popular about every 10 years.  I play infrequently with other people's constructed decks or draft.  The club has a big 'ole box of Magic cards for just such an occasion.  I don't collect or preconstruct decks.

Played Magic for a long time when it was first released. The game itself isn't bad, but it's a money drain when you want to keep playing regularly and compete even on just a local scale.

Collection consists of 7 casual EDH/Commander decks:
- Drana, Kalastria Bloodchief (B) (creature removal, big mana, discard)
- Niv-Mizzet, Firemind (UR) (burns, draws, mind-controls, clones)
- Ashling the Pilgrim (R) (burns, dragons, equipment)
- Sharuum the Hegemon (WUB) (artifact recursion, sphinxes)
- Rafiq of the Many (GWU) (Voltron'ish good-stuff?)
- Momir Vig, Simic Visionary (GU) (janky toolbox)
- Kresh the Bloodbraided (BRG) (creature removal, big bodies)

Commander 2016
- Yidris, Maelstrom Wanderer (slightly upgraded)

Commander 2017 Set (slightly upgraded)
- Arahbo, Roar of the World (GW, Cat Tribal, equipment)
- Edgar Markov (WBR, Vampire Tribal, aggro, life-gain)
- Inalla, Archmage Ritualist (UBR, Wizard Tribal, shenanigans?)
- The Ur-Dragon (WUBRG, Dragon Tribal, stompy?)

No infinite combos that I know of, other than probably something with Momir Vig's Experiment Kraj. Not very tuned for competitive play; just fun kitchen table EDH decks!

>>> Rating Comments >>> (Only relates to Commander/Elder-Dragon-Highlander format, which is the format I play)

Yes, Magic: The Gathering isn't for everyone. Yes, it has a complicated rule set and decades of set releases to contend with. However, for me, there's a lot of things that click!

After 500+ Plays:  I used to play this game all the time, but basically stopped completely once I was exposed to BoardgameGeek and all the games here.  It's hard to rate because I still think this is a great game, with some of the most interesting design ideas I've ever come across, but I will rarely if ever play again.  I'm no longer interested in spending all the time and money keeping up with the newest sets and going to tournaments, but I'm also not interested in casual multi-player games.  My reverence for the design and memories of all the fun times had while playing, though, are enough to keep my rating at a 10.

I would mark this as "owend" or "used to own" but I feel like I cant say that unless I had every single card in the game. Eh, I was really good at this game and almost made the PT. The game is "fine" it works, what isn't fine is the exploitative distribution model and practices of WotC's MTG. 
Seriously this is the MOST expensive game to play ever devised by man, there are SINGLE CARDS that cost more than the entirety of the rest of the games I have rated. That is a price to fun ratio that can't be ignored by anyone.
This is as much a game as a Nigerian Prince email is an investment.

I used to have a great number of Magic cards in my youth. Some of them I still have. I haven't played since 4th Edition (I think, it might have been 5th), so a lot has happened in the Magic world since then. Sadly there is no one now with any cards to play with, so they sit in their boxes collecting dust. I occasionally look fondly on my Elder Dragon Legends, but that's as far as it goes. A great game if you can find someone with reasonable ability to play against though.

RATING: 9
At it's best nothing can compete with this. The only problem I have with the game is that there is a little too much luck. I don't mind a bit of luck but a decent proportion of games are decided on initial card draw (e.g. mana screw).

Infinitas posibilidades. Un juego con una personalidad incuestionable, la referencia indiscutible en el mundo de los juegos de cartas.

Sus cartas, la división de colores y la miríada de habilidades constituye en sí un lenguaje propio que no deja de crecer. Tu labor es aprender, revisar, estudiar todo ese legado y como un orfebre tomar cada pieza y ponerla en su sitio. Las posibilidades son infinitas, trabaja tus ideas, resuelve los puzzles y dilemas que se crucen en tu cabeza hasta poder dar con ese mazo que exprese y funcione como realmente quieres. Y cuando te estrelles, vuelve a empezar. 

Un placer infinito.

Spent too much time and money on it. Sad thing that you can only be in the "same league" if you always keep up with the new cards. We all used to play it with old cards later - as long as you are roughly on the same level (with the value/power of your cards) this game is great. I would substract 2 points only for the collectible BS of it though...

Played heavily between 1996-2006. 

I stopped because boardgames are more fun and don't cost that much. Also LCG have replaced Magic completely for me. 

Playing kitchen sink Magic does not appeal to me since the interesting cards that provide any kind of strategy in this game are the rare ones. To get them you need to rely on luck or buy them separately and that becomes costly very quickly. It is also a very addictive process. 

I feel that LCG have mechanically modernized. Magic still struggles with some old mechanisms: landdraw, relying on luck to get your cards or buy expensive  tutors. There is skill in magic : deckbuilding requires a vast amount of meta knowledge. Also timing the effects of the rarer cards, knowing when to play them is strategic. Yet there also always have been decks that are draw, pay, play without too much thinking, because it's more the cards and their interaction that deliver gameplay and not so much the mechanics of the game.

love it or hate it you can't deny it is a very novel and clever way to make money...frankly I love the game, the right balance between the meta-game and the game... I still go out occasionally and buy a few boosters of the latest expansion just to get a "fix"...and now my sons are playing so I've upped my consumption and number of plays again!

RATING: 7
This game deserves a lot of respect for kick starting an entire genre of games, but it definitely shows it's age. Although it is still a fun and quick filler, with a theme that I love, it requires too much money to take seriously and the problems with getting mana screwed (where you draw either too many or too few mana cards to even be able to play) are a death sentence.

Sure, you could just play with the starter packs to avoid the cost issues, but that removes a big part of the experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Much maligned, and ultimately an expensive part of the hobby, but it is one of the best concepts for a game, and I bet you can't name another game that you can put in your pocket, play anywhere, and is so different from game to game based upon the strategy and content of your deck.  But for constant changes to the rules system and too many of the jerks who play and cheat at it, I believe it is one of the top 5 games ever designed.

I started at the end of Unlimited and the beginning of Revised and I gave it up when Ice Age came out. Briefly picked it up again for a sealed deck tournament of Weatherlight. Just got too expensive and complicated. Plus most of my favorite cards were banned or restricted. I still  play the Microprose game every now and then because it really is fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The granddaddy of all TCGs.

I fear that any game with an evolving meta, shaped by an ever-increasing pool of cards, makes it impossible to keep up with and ultimately just play casually, especially in my case. It really becomes a lifestyle, requiring dedication to that of eSports. Unfortunately it also suffers from the FoMO-induced collectability aspect found in other CCGs, further exploited by the secondary market.

Not too crazy about the theme.

Very simple (at least used to be when I played) and actually quite boring. The collection aspect makes the game even worse.

Casual player. Can run into a bit of trouble sometimes with the rules, since I only play sporadically and don't care to become a rules wiz, but I love the cards themselves and enjoy the game without getting too technical.

Update: I think by now, I'm familiar enough with the rules that I don't usually have a problem. My favorite way to play these days is with the Duel Decks. They are easy to set up, balanced, thematicallty tied to each other, and powerful.

RATING: 7
When it first came out, I thought "yes, this is the kind of game I've been looking for, something where the cards are your playing area and pieces." (Except I was thinking of a sci-fi game.) An inspiring design that started a whole gaming genre. Some of the most fun I had was with 5-player games where everyone played a different colour, despite possible balance issues. A well thought out design. Was at its best in its innocent, initial stages. I'd had enough after a year (its first year), but I clearly underestimated the addictive effect it would have on other people.

The original CCG... What ended up costing me thousands of dollars (not just with this game, but with all the other CCGs I played afterward, once I got hooked to the concept).

Although the lands concept is kinda flawed at its base (probably the reason pretty much every resource-based CCG nowadays uses a system where any card can be used as a resource), I still like playing the game every now and then, particularly in limited formats.

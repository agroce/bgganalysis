An excellent children's game - it's easy to learn, but not mind-numbing for adults.  Just enough strategy, just enough luck, a lot of fun for the family.  My five year old loves this game.

Rated as a kids game.  This is going to be a terrific link between straight-line racing dice games and games more strategic, like Daytona 500.  My daughter will still need more time before she can play this by portioning out her own dice, but she enjoys it enough when I do that now.

Update: She can portion the dice herself now and is having a great time!

This is a game my kids love to play, but we almost never finish a play because of sore losers.

Hardly the game's fault, but racing games need to be a bit shorter with smaller kids to prevent these issues.

Eine wunderbare Grundidee, die noch um ein paar Regeln erweitert werden sollte. Wer drei gleiche Farben würfelt, darf daraus eine beliebige Farbe machen. Wer nicht voran kommt, bekommt einen Chip. Chips können wieder abgegeben werden, wenn man aus zwei gleichen Farben eine beliebige Farbe machen möchte. Außerdem sind in dem Spiel zu viele Hindernisse. Strecken mit mehr Freiräumen machen auch mehr Spaß.

Dice based racing game that while still very much luck based, is leaps and bounds ahead of other games for 5-6 year olds...yes I'm looking at you candyland and "chutes and ladders".

Initial Impressions:
-----------------------
No decisions to be made here. My Nephew actually LOVES the game, which is why I played it with him, but it was basically candy land 2.0.

Going to see if I can get the Monza Advanced rules to the table to see if it improves this one at all.

RATING: 7.5
Good game for kids learning movement optimization as they have to try to make the optimal move with the colored dice casted.  I suspect that Monza is for kids 5 years old maximum so it's a game that has a durability of one or two years.

My daughter loved it at the age of 5 years old but I'm worried that, if I get a copy for her, she shall get tired of it soon.

This rating is thinking as my daugther would rate it.

RATING: 7
As kids games go, this one is quick and fun.  You have a race track with randomly colored spaces.  You roll six dice with different colors on each side.  You move your car for each color space you have a die face that matches.  We made a house rule that if you have zero color matches, you can still move a single space; because my five year old have 5 turns where nothing matched and broke into tears.

This is a pretty good kid's game that isn't completely brain dead-play for adults. It teaches kids to analyze the result of a dice pool with cascading effects. I feel like it's still just beyond my recently turned four year old, and it likely has a short shelf life in terms of age, but it's interesting and novel.

Roll six dice. Each die has six colors on its faces. The board is made up of the same colors. You basically build the longest sequence of spaces based on your die-roll.

A fine game for what it is. Not a lot of choices, but it does usually ask players to optimize a bit. The optimization problem is usually simple for 6yo and up, but 4-6yos will enjoy it. Essentially: Which of the two ways can I go from here? If both, which has the best prospects thereafter?

Jan 2013 The kids still like it, but they now play more complex games so this ones gets downgraded to a 7 again.

Fun racing game for kids.  My daughter (6 yrs. old) prefers the dice-based racers to the card-based racers (i.e. Karawane), so this went over pretty well with her.  I like that it makes kids think about what order they want to use the dice rather than just seeing the space in front of them and automatically using up that color.  Good game for younger kids.

RATING: 6.8
This game is a hit with my younger daughter and she can get anyone to play it with her.  Adults go in thinking it they are just playing to appease my daughter, but then get into the competitive and puzzle-like nature of the game.  It never fails how verbally disappointing people get (who thought this was just a kid's game) when they roll and can't move.  Plays best with more players, and a quick easy play!

Great game for younger children. I think of it as candyland with thinking required.

A cross between Das MotorSportSpiel and Candyland.  Seriously!

My rating is based on the target audience of young children and the fact that it's great fun for kids and parents to play together.  For serious gamers it's just a decent filler -- for that purpose I'd recommend using a turn timer of no more than 10 seconds.

Roll-and-move, but I prefer to think of it as Formula-D Lite :-)  Kids (ages 4-6yo) played it for a while, but once they "solved" it (i.e. worked out the dice-arrangement technique, and picked up on the significance of lanes), pretty much stopped.  But I reckon it had served its purpose by that stage.

Just a great, great kids game. I presented it in my son's preschool (in France where we live) his first and second years, and would have again this year except they already had it. It seems fairly common in French preschools, in fact, and with reason: It's super-simple, cute, colorful and durable. But especially, the color-order-optimization mechanism is challenging for little kids, but is easy to learn and visualize as you play. The kids have to line the dice up first in the order they think they should be played, and only then do they get to move their car. If they made a mistake, they can go back and see where. It's the kind of game that has made Haba's reputation.
Now, at home, we optional- or house-rule it more. I personally like the every-round-you-move-forward-at-least-one-space rule, we use the landing-on-the-same-square-pushes-the-other-player-foward rule, and especially we use the "turbo" idea someone posted where you can stack dice of the same color if it's at the end of your chosen series and use the stacked dice like so many wilds. It adds one more possible permutation into the mix, but is otherwise just thematic fun that my preschooler loves.
Update: My second child has shown far less interest in this one than did my first. I've cooled on it a little, though it remains a classic kids game for me.

Unable to keep the kids interest. Game mechanic is good although the colors should be sharper. Of the (excellent) HABA games this is perhaps a little lacking on the components because of the board. Game does play quick. Got better when kids turned 3-4 year (give it an '8'); youngest likes to roll lots of dice! Update: Has lost kids appeal now that they are 5 and older.

RATING: 7.5
I rate the games according to how willing I am to play with the appropriate aged child.

I think quite highly of this racing game.  I like the movement that is based on how a player orders the colors. If they plan well, they might be able to move ahead farther. The lane switching option introduces a mechanic used in Formula D. I also like the obstacles in the track.  The variant suggested, also has the potential for additional strategy for older children.

My 5 year old grandson is learning significant strategy quickly with this game, and therefore I have increased my rating.  Also this game is very well designed.  

The components are wonderful, and the board colorful.

This is a great light game of racing. The components are of good quality. like all Haba games and the game play is simple and easy to teach/learn.

Players are rolling dice and trying to move their cars around the track, depending on the colors on the dice.If a car lands on the same space as another car, the new car takes its place and the other is pushed back a square. Each race last 1 lap and the winner is of course the one to cross the finish line first.

This is a good one for the kids and the other family members won't mind playing, as it's pretty fun for them also. It makes a decent filler game too.

This is a good quality, interesting, and skill developing game for kids aged 3+ (maybe 4+).  With a little more tactical decision-making than simply roll and play, the game requires ordering the colors to try to make the most of each turn. It's a great game to introduce kids to simple decision making that will help prepare them as they get older to play more complicated games.

Monza es un juego que navega dentro de lo que podríamos llamar juegos educativos, más que de ganar y competir trata de intentar ver la combinación de colores que se ajusta más a la tirada de dados que hemos conseguido y avanzar nuestro coche lo máximo posible.

Playing it with my kids.

No challenge for adults, of course. Usually you have one, sometimes two possibilities to move on your turn. Sometimes you cannot move at all; as a house-rule we allow to re-roll in that case, because the little once get frustrated. Still I like how the track layout provides different paces over the course of the game, with some tight passages in the middle and a speedy end game :)

Mostly it's really a training in focussing on the colors and seeing the better of the two choices, if you have them.

Good production quality. Nice map, cute car meeples.

[b]Update 10/2014:[/b] Small drop. The no-move turns when you are stuck in the middle of the track are annoying; with many players it's a little bit too long.

RATING: 6.5
I generally like racing games, so I was excited to get this to play with my kids.

HABA's components, per usual, are excellent. With one of the central mechanisms being rolling a ton of dice, kids enjoy it. And since you move by the color on the die, you can actually have a modicum of strategy AND teachable moments with kids as they riddle out how many dice they can use. Frankly, I think there's a good secondary lesson in that they learn they can't always use _all_ the dice every turn and some turns they can only use one or no dice.

The problem comes in the fact that there's just one board, so re-playability will become an issue if you enjoy it. I wish HABA had come up with a double-sided board to extend the re-playability and add some variety (not unlike Formula De/D boards). Also, this one board does have a color-limited bottleneck about halfway through -- and it was very clearly designed to be that way, While I don't mind some patches of the board being a bit more difficult, cars frequently get stalled there for several turns -- and it can really dampen a kid's enthusiasm. In my mind, that's avoidable. Still, it does hit the table and we combat this defect by having the cars race in teams.

This is a great kid's game and teaches reasoning at same time children are learning colors.  Beyond kids...well, I don't think there's much here.

Great Haba racing game with super-nice components. The boys (2, 4, 5) simply love it. It is also fun for adults to play. The sound affects (made by adults and kids together:'vrrrm') and the TV broadcaster (usually impersonated by me) are a must during gameplay. Watch, and you will see your children thinking ahead, and learning basic tactical skills in no time!
Somebody wrote, that it would be so good to have a double sided board for greater variability and maybe another level of difficulty - I can not agree more. But this should not bother anybody to get it.
You should have it!

Color-matching and (for advanced kids) route-planning by looking for the best overall color matches instead of the first available.

Holding it back are the relatively number of choke points on the board, which make it probable that a player will have at least one turn with at most 1 movement out of a possible 6. Address it by house-ruling a re-roll option.

Simple roll and move game with movement reminiscent of Runebound (!), you roll 6 dice with coloured spots, then you can move your race card around the track on the coloured spaces that match your dice.

This game is rated from the perspective of a 4-year old.

Our family loves Monza!  The kids pulled this game off of the shelf on their own because of the race car theme.  Then, when we played it, everybody had a blast - both 4-year old twins and Dad.

The mechanics of this game do allow for some strategic choices - which is great for kids their age - but it is not overwhelming.  

Interestingly, the kids LOVE the take-that mechanic where one race car can bump another back one space - even when it is their car getting bumped back!

This game has moved past Go Away Monster, My First Orchard, Animal Upon Animal, Hide the Kids, etc, as the best received kids game that we have tried.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Monza is a giant leap from [gameid=5048]. Rather than just move to the color drawn players roll 6 dice and can choose whatever route possible matching the colors on the dice to those on the track. The order you use your dice is important to how far you can move. Of course for adults it's very simple to find the best route. It's possible that there are some real choices to make when playing with 5 or 6 as the track has a couple of bottlenecks.

RATING: 6
We are so not ready for this. 5 and up sounds about right.

[Update 4 yrs 2mos: We got halfway around the track before losing focus and reverting to flying cars. Progress anyway.]

My son developed the ability to instantly recognize the number rolled on a die way, way before the ability to follow directions and understand the goals of a game (which, with few exceptions, hasn't happened yet). So why are the so many games with colors on the dice (or cards)? Do most kids pick up how to play a game before number sense? Didn't God create the integers?

[update 4 yrs 5 mos: we pretty much played a complete game, with a car only flying once. I don't know why a game for young children has to have that tight spot on the backstretch where you can get stuck for several turns. In some places 6 dice are too much, in others they're not enough.]

Christmas 2015 present for my son, at the time slightly older than 4. He could handle the game just fine. It's a dice-driven racing game where you roll a handful of dice where there's a single color on each side, and the colors correspond to spaces on the board. On your turn you roll the dice and then you can sequence the dice however you wish as you try and advance around the track, using each die only once. 

He can grasp the game just fine, and so it's a good children's game for now. Plays very quickly and odds are good you play several in a sitting. Yes, there's luck, but it's really a decent introduction to sequencing. Kids can easily beat their parents.

It's a nice wooden race game.  Pretty boring though, so my 4 yr old isn't really into it like I hoped he would be.

Solid kids game that teaches order of operations and choosing the best of 2 or 3 options. nice components, small footprint. Not much here for mum and dad, but it's short and non-frustrating. A good choice.

Good for what it's trying to be. Adults can join in with their kids - it doesn't take that long to play or set up. The kids are going to get some good skills out of this one up to the age of five or so. Counting, planning, etc, all in a nicely themed package. Probably deserves a better rating than I'm giving here. Worth a place in any kids collection up to a certain age.

Nice little kids game.  I really like the dice rolling and slight tactical choices you get to make which elevate the color matching above the silliness of Candy Land.  Also, it has the plus of playing in a short amount of time.

Monza is an excellent children's game that combines the excitement of auto racing with some light strategy, such as setting yourself up for the next turn.  I've introduced it to many children at parties and it's been universally liked so far.

My 4-yo wants to play this almost every day, and I don't mind since it's a fairly quick game with some decisions to be made. 

The rules as written make for a fine game, but my son's always coming up with variations to the rules, which keeps the play interesting and increases the decision-making. The variants we use most often include: 3 of a kind is wild, a car on its own color is safe from being bumped, and using all six of the dice gets you one extra roll (most useful when we each play with three cars, where the dice roll can be split among any of our cars and all need to finish in order to win). 

I've really seen my son develop his tactical thinking with this game as he evaluates his different choices. The theme is appealing, and the components are great. Rating is for a kids' game.

I was sure my 10yr old son would be way too old to enjoy this one, but still wanted to add it to my games library for the younger school kids I play with .. Well was I ever wrong! 10yr old loves working out the 'best moves' for each dice roll, meaning who can be bump back and how far can they go ?? 

So glad I got this as it's really getting him thinking and then re-thinking ..  A great problem solving game for an Aspie, and it's proved very popular with the RDA (riding for disabled) kids & volunteers too! :)

RATING: 6
Rated as a kids game. 

I had higher hopes for this based on some enthusiastic comments. I didn't see the awesomeness. It is good, but I certainly don't enjoy it.

"It's a kids game", you say. "It is not for you." 
"But" I reply, "there are lots of kids games that dad can enjoy too."
"Name one!"
"Animal Upon Animal, Magic Labyrinth, Max." I reply superiorly.
"That's three dummy"
"Who died and made you boss?!"
"Your Mom."
"So!"
"Good one!"
"I know!"

That's what's wrong with Monza. It's not sophisticated enough for me.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 5


Overall - 4

This high rating is for kids only - although it is very playable for the adult that tags along.

While displaying a board that might suggest ( insert gasp here ) Candyland,  this is in no way comparable to that decision free stroll.  Luck is the driving factor here though,  as it should be in a game with this target audience.  But there are calculations to be made on every dice roll,  that make this a truly engaging affair.

A quick hit with a 4-year-old (it may help that he happens to always win).

No real strategy, but opportunity to optimize dice usage each turn.  Also the excitement of a race.

This game is surprisingly good in practice, even as an adult (playing with children).  I'm still figuring out how to rate kid's games.  For now, I'm giving it a 9, and I do want to play it often, even if it doesn't serve me per se.

While a decent kid's game with pieces that we expect from Haba, there are a couple of spots on the board where it's possible to get stuck waiting for 1 particular colour. This could get very frustrating for the target audience.

It's a simple dice-chucking racing game with a taste of Candyland, but there's a bit more "analysis" to how your colored dice results will weave you around the track.  It's been a real hit with my 4, 6 & 8 year old...and I'm enjoying it too.  Another Great HABA find!

Monza is a very nice game for kids. They like to put dice on the track to see where they can move their car. However, there is no real choice. To win, you just have to optimize every turn and have more luck than yours opponents. What's more, you can stay a long time blocked in the one row part of the track.
On the other way, it's very quick to play and not unpleasant. So, a very good gateway game to introduce modern game, but not a brilliant game for already introduced players.

Simply an outstanding racing game for kids from ages 4 to 7...and even my 8 and 10 year olds don't mind playing it!  Kids on the low end of the age range will struggle to optimize their dice rolls, but the more they play the better they will get.

My 3 1/2 year old loves this. There's some thought involved in ordering the coloured dice when moving. And the game is short so adults don't get bored. Viva Topo is still my favourite kids game but for young kids this is perfect. Another game I recommend for young kids is Bugs in the Kitchen (also good for any age).

This is a nice quick roll the dice and match the colors game that my kids were able to pick up very quickly and enjoy.  It plays pretty fast (which I feel is a must for a race game) and its fun to string a bunch of moves out of a good roll on the dice.  However, it is possible to get stuck in one place for a while if you have bad dice luck as there are a couple places on the track where only one or two colors can move you forward.  This can be frustrating for small people (and some big people) or I would rate this a perfect 10 as a kid's game.

My main rating is as a kid's game.  For adults this is probably a 5.

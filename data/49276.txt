RATING: 5
A very light introductory wargame that is highly portable and plays in about an hour. I like that Barbarossa is divided into army group sections. Unlike [thing=68250][/thing] and [thing=76994][/thing], this does not use the Unknown Soviet mech armor units.  The rest of the mechanics are pretty much the same, so this is a a tad bit more basic.  However, this offers the [thing=92125]Winter Counter-offensive expansion[/thing], whereas the others do not have expansions.

The only problem is that the game reveals its secret in the first play and there's not much that makes you want to come back for more.

RATING: 7
Nice and straightforward. In its simplicity renders on a small scale the devastating resistance of the soviet army against the massive attempts of the Nazis to gain terrain.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great little game, playable in an hour or a little bit more if you push at it. The sense of the unstoppable Germans racing to get to Moscow before winter sets in, impeded by the mud, and facing the endless hordes of Russians, seems to tell the historical story in a very few simple rules. Great game and want to try more in this family.

Solo'd a game.  It is a very nice, compact training game for many of the elements used in hex n'counter wargames.  The game ended in a draw as the Soviets pushed a panzer corp out of Moscow in the last turn.

Played another with my son, who enjoyed it quite a bit.

Une version C3i de qualité avec ses "gros" pions. Des règles sans ambiguïtés. Des parties rapides...Mais l'Allemand a t'il une chance de l'emporter?
Il est trop tributaire des jets de dés initiaux et même si le sort lui est favorable il lui faudra renouveler cette percée au moins encore une fois pour espérer atteindre Moscou.
Le rôle du soviétique n'est guère palpitant.A réserver au jeu en solitaire comme un petit casse tête en prenant les Allemands...Moi, je n'ai pas trouvé la solution.

What makes this game great is its simplicity of design, balance, clarity of mechanics, its ability to represent the key elements of the operation, and most of all its success at sparking an interest and fanning the flame of war gaming.  Sure there is much more to the hobby, and more sophisticated games at that. But they are not going to have the success that this will in generating young wargamers.  Hats off to Frank Chadwick and Alan Emrich for what they have done here!

My first real wargame - - and this little intro to the world is excellent.  Not too over-complicated, excellent rules and tutorial Battlesson -- highly recommended starting point for those taking a few tentative steps towards grognard, provided you also buy a nice piece of clear perspex to keep the map down!

RATING: 5.5
I think this title is great for beginner wargamers who wants a more approachable and less intimidating experience. The rulebook is short and concise and is probably one of the best rulebook I have ever read, making it very easy to learn, it took me 10 minutes and I was up and running. For the veteran wargamer, the distilled experience is still very pure and fun, you will love the short setup time and not having to worry about stacking for once. If you want to play a short war before bedtime, this game is a great bet.

I will give this a solid 7.5 out of 10, its a great little wargame (and a 5.5 out of 10 when compared with every other wargame in my collection (see my user profile to see how I rate all my games)

This was the first time in my wargame learning progression that I played a game that actually felt like a "Wargame". While still relatively benign it manages to pack a lot of lessons into a tiny simulation. Terrain and fortification bonuses are introduced here as well as the dynamics of effectively using mechanized units in concert with infantry. It is a perfect introductory game that can be played in an hour or less that is quick to set up and offers some tactical options to those looking to stretch their Armchair General's legs.

Fantastic introduction to wargaming.

It plays incredibly quickly once you've got the rules down, and there seems to be plenty of ways to approach the conflict, so that speaks well of replayability.

[still haven't played it enough to warrant a rating]
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
It plays fast. But this is probably only positive I can say about this game.

I quite disliked my session because of following factors:
1) all Soviet units are same
2) strange sequence of game (it is really difficult to get german infantry into fight and also it is weird that railroad movent for Soviets is before combat.
3) combat table offers too few results

RATING: 5
(Rating based on two plays)

Not bad, but also nothing outstanding. Good to fill some time between longer wargames. I think it's a bit too single-sided. Whole initiative to attack is on the German player, while the Russians are on the defence. Once Russians take their positions on fortifications around Moscow they have no reason to even try moving forward from them. They just have to camp and wait for the game to end (they need to show a bit of initiative to control one more city).

   Great game for new wargamers, teaches all of the basic concepts and fairly fun for a few plays. I think the number of pieces can bog down play, I have often played with trim down armies allowing for more maneuvering and still essentially have the same game as with full armies. Its fun, its classic, its cheap and its a grand tool.

Upgraded version from GMT's C3i Nr. 25, featuring article on Labyrinth.  

I punched the the game in no time and set it up. Completed the game solitaire in one day with 7 turns. What a classic indeed from Frank Chadwick! The game was quick to play and finish. The result is a draw as the furthest German 40th Panzer Corps, being the only single unit, reached the gate of Moscow only just in the last turn - no time to capture it, while it is being defended by 19th Infantry Army at a 1-2 odd ratio. No combat is allowed to take place below 1-2. All other cities are taken by the Germans, from Tula to Rzhev. 

Very nice game and it offers quite a convincing story historically - the Germans panzers have to go south to find the space to attack. The center part is otherwise halted and slowed by the many trenches and densely forested areas. The Vyazma Defense Line is fallen, with the 5th Infantry Army remaining in the trench. Half of the Mozhaisk Defense Line is captured by the German, including the city of Mozhaisk. The last one Moscow Defense Line is still intact, guarded by the freshly replaced 33th, 43th and 49th Infantry Army. 

The Soviet replacement rate is 5 times than that of the German most of the time and this replacement rate saves the day (or week as it is the time of the turn) of the Soviet Union. So even though the CRT result is bloody enough, the Soviet Units just keep on returning from the dead pile to the map. Kind of frustration for the German player.  The game is good enough to warrant for more play, especially a competitive 2-player one.  What's more, perhaps I should get the expansion game too.

I gave this game a 7 as one has to remember what it is designed to do...introduce others into boardgaming.  At that, I think this game is very effective, as it is challenging, fast, and fun to play.

Expansion available if you want a longer game
Both sides play differently
An intro to wargaming design masterpiece

Cons:
Replayability?  Still, it's good for a few plays from both sides due to the sides playing a different strategy.
Map could easily be larger for my taste, especially since I like to rotate moved counters.

Tidy little strategic war game, published in C3i Magazine #25 (I bought the magazine for its [I]Labyrinth[/I] stuff not realizing that this game was included—what a pleasant surprise!). Beautifully produced, plays cleanly and quickly. The simplicity of the Russian setup makes solo play from the German perspective especially appealing.

I'm not the biggest Russian front fan, but I like the way this game encapsulates the seemingly endlessly fascinating "Can the Germans capture Moscow before the snow flies?" question so simply and succinctly. Having played the game several times, both solo and face-to-face, the answer appears to remain "Probably not." [4 plays]

Excellent little game, and a great game for introducing people to hex and counter.

The German side is harder to play. Handicap by reducing Russian replacements as needed to balance skill level.

RATING: 6.8
Hard to beat as a light filler or introductory game.  Its simplicity is its greatest asset and problem.  The game covers the very basics of wargames but not much more, making it an easy and quick game.  However, the simplicity removes any true depth and makes general strategies easy.  A good game for what it is.

very pleased with this small format game, the intention of the design always was as an intro to bring new gamers in, but this also plays well enough for experienced to players to enjoy.

just 3 pages of rules (3 really as P1 is the intro and fluffy stuff). Clever to see how much has been got from those 3 pages. Tough one for the germans, engages both players as the German is forever seeking an exoploitation and the Russian is trying to close any such avenues down. 

Takes around an hour (or less) to play ti is ideal as a filler or as a midweek fix !

Looking forward to diving in on this Victory Point Games Battlesson and it's expansion, I have a few Victory Point Games that I will be playing in the near future. More to follow.
8/24/16: In my opinion, one of the better polybag type games out there. Definitely a great Battlesson game by VPG, and possibly one of the better games on the Battle of Moscow(Operation Typhoon). That being said while realizing that it is a introductory style game, the rules are nicely laid out, and well organized. After a turn or two the game is easily picked up and runs smoothly. The tough strategic choice for German and Russian player is present despite the simplified introductory layout. As Germany cannot commit all its firepower across the board but must choose 1 or 2 avenues and stick with it. The Russians must decide when to hold tough onto a city or fortress or key defensive position and when to fall back, and when to rebuild key units and counter-attack. Looking forward now to adding the expansion, and also looking forward to Battle for Moscow 2.

The Battle for Moscow is and should always be  important to
the hobby. Beside the game being "super fun" to play, it is the first
portal to wargaming.  So if you have a friend, you know, a friend who loves history and such, this is the one to pull

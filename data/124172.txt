RATING: 6
2-7-15: We played this once over a year ago and had kind of a blah experience with it. The game was very random, even considering this is a Tsuro game. I'd like to try it again but unless my opinion changes much this is a candidate for trade later this year.

UPDATE 6-17-15: Traded for La Isla in Dice Tower Con Math Trade.

Fun, light game that can accommodate more people than most games. I like the look and smaller board of the original Tsuro a bit more, but the sea theme is good, too. The dragons are fiddly, but can be used to add some chaos to the game.

This expansion doesn't add a whole lot to the base game.  It takes away some of the beautiful simplicity of the original, and makes the game a lot more fiddly than it should be.

RATING: 6
Apesar de ser competitivo, o jogo tem um clima tão lírico que não traz muita tensão para a mesa. A parte ruim é que com a eliminação - muitas vezes precoce - de alguns jogadores, quem fica de fora não se diverte tanto. Os Daikaijus também são extremamente importantes para a estratégia do jogo. Nunca joguei o Tsuro original, mas dá pra falar com segurança que ele deve ser simples demais sem a presença dos monstros marinhos.

This game demanded one of the shortest rules-explanation I have yet come across! Yet, despite its simplicity, it offers up a fun competitive experience. Short, supports a high player-count, and pretty to look at. A passable little filler game.

I've played Tsuro several times as a filler at game gatherings. But this one for me is better in every way. Wonderful production values (love the plastic ship pieces) and fun randomness of the dragons. It's a really smart game that supports 8 players (!) and that's the part that truly tips it over the top for me. I have so few games that I enjoy with that number of people.

Simply chaos. Without sea monster would be standard Tsuro with worse graphics. Then it would rate as 7-8.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's fun like Tsuro, but with the dragons (or well... "big monsters"), it does make it a bit more random. Still fun though. And the option to play like base Tsuro doesn't hurt. The daikaiju do make it a bit fiddly, but it's fun avoiding them and watching them suddenly kill another player. Good thing it's short though, because the elimination is a lot more luck-based.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
I like that it can be played like regglar Tsuro with the option of playing the dragons. I wasn't a huge fan of the chaos they created, but since I can play the game both ways, I effectively get two games in one!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
Very fun game that is playable by all ages, and experience levels. I give this version the edge over the original due to the added Dragon variable that can be used or removed from the game. I highly recommend this game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like the game, but very unsure about the dragons.  The risk of player elimination early in the game really did not go over well.  One player was eliminated on the 3rd turn of a game that took 15 turns, and overall, I felt that the random nature of dragons detracted from the lightness of the game itself.

For what it's worth, I enjoy the game without dragons for what it is: a simple, quick game of chance, where the true victory is seeing someone else's face turn sour when they realize there is no hope left for them.

I ended up trading this on, as it wasn't as enjoyable for the time as other games I have.

This plays exactly like original Tsuro. We didn't play with dragons though. I don't really like the game at all, but I do like the aspect where 8 people can play a game together, have it be quick and still have a good time. Tsuro doesn't try to be a deep strategy game, so it's good at what it does.

Much prefer the original. The daikaiju element is annoying and makes the game very unpredictable.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Granted, Tsuro (not Tsuro of the Seas, Tsuro) isn't a particularly deep strategy game. But for a 10 minute abstract strategy that you can teach in 30 seconds and which supports 8, it's a reasonable game to play to fill time while waiting for people to show up at an event.

Tsuro of the Seas seems like someone actively went out of their way to destroy everything good about Tsuro. It adds fiddly rules about dragon movement and turns it from a 10 minute strategy game into 15 minute Uno/War/battle tops, where most of the extra 5 minutes goes to updating dragons and moving them about. I believe that the dragons destroy tiles, if I recall correctly, so it can also allow two players to keep duking it out longer, after everyone else has been eliminated, by pure chance. The original had an absolute cap on how long everything goes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Awesome artwork and the boats are spectacular. Great game and can play with 8 players. Lots of fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The small addition of the Daikaiju tiles saves this game from becoming stale! That small little addition to Tsuro might seem insignificant to some, but I can speak from experience, it has guarantied that the game has longevity and MUCH more replayability. After playing Tsuro of the Sea for the first time I knew there was no reason to keep the original Tsuro, and I am very happy with my upgrade. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A very light game that is easy to understand and play. Might be a bit too light for my tastes though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wonderful little light game. Scales pretty well from 2 to 8, quick to play (so elimination is not a problem), and really looks awesome on the table. I find it almost impossible to only play one round, even 2P (where you can avoid your opponent's devious plans for longer)

Just be sure to play with the right rule for the daikaiju movement (when rolling 6, 7, or 8) - you only roll *one* dice in total and apply that same result to *every* present daikaiju!

Nice nautical topic game. If you remove the sea monsters, you have the same original Tsuro (only then in nautical style - what I personally love).
So far, great fun for me. Nice filling game and quick to play / explain.

RATING: 8.25
Definitely an excellent game. Fills a very interesting niche in my collection, as it is strategic, quick to play, and has a high player count. For all of those reasons it will probably see a lot of play. I never got around to playing vanilla Tsuro, but I have to say that those rules are how I choose to play this game. The dragons just make the game too chaotic and add in a very transparent degree of luck. They seem to increase the overall duration of the game, while creating the potential for some players to be eliminated arbitrarily early. Overall an excellent game in my collection.

Es un juego sencillo, ideal para iniciar a no-jugadores que no se ven realmente entusiasmados con los juegos de tablero. Claramente tiene poca profundidad, y ahí recae su fortaleza y debilidad, es un juego que sale a mesa fácil, pero que no brinda demasiado después de un tiempo.

Dentro de su simpleza es un juego muy divertido y rápido, pero sólo para iniciar, luego va perdiendo gracia.

More complex and more fun that standard Tsuro. This time you're running from the dragons. Or trying to at least. And there is something about rolling those dice to see if the dragons are awake. Here dragon dragon dragon. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Watched a player get eliminated on the second turn due to someone else rolling the dice and placing a dragon on top of them.  That alone killed the game for me, since the roll for dragons is mandatory and zero skill went into eliminating said player.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
What I don't like: the larger tiles are incompatible with the original Tsuro, the unnecessarily large boats are practically the same size as the tiles so just having two boats on the same tile is crowded, and the larger box makes it really inconvenient to carry around. I would suggest just getting the original Tsuro.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Started enjoying this game when my game group removed all the randomness that irritated the heck out of us. We only play with 1 dragon and is placed in the middle of the board. Normal movement applies and if we ever roll a "6" once a dragon is about to move, we just replace it with a new dragon instead of adding another one. I guess we can also apply this house rule for two dragons symmetrically placed on the board.

Adds more chaos to Tsuro. Not really worth the effort. The dragons slow the game down immensely.

RATING: 5
Builds upon the rules of Tsuro. Still a solid filler with simple rules that plays fast with up to eight players.

Adding the dragons into the mix creates more tension, but makes the game much more fiddly. Rolling the dice to see if the dragons awaken, then rolling the dice again to see how they move, then rolling the dice again to occasionally add a new dragon makes the game lose a lot of its original elegance.

I like that you can play it the original way or with dragons.  I like dragons with any number over 4.

Place a tile, move any piece that touched the tile along the relevant path. If two pieces cross paths they are eliminated, if a piece goes off the board it is eliminated. Whichever player has the last piece on the board wins.
Very simple, takes up to eight players, good to start an evening while waiting for the latecomers.

Gorgeous design. Hard to rate, since the game is decidedly and purposefully random. Yet somewhat fun. Surprisingly enough, I liked this better with daikaijus than without, despite nearly all player elimination happening through dice rolls.

One of my favourite games! The original Tsuro is great, but the nautical theme is what really drew me to this. Also, the artwork and components are just AMAZING. Sure, the addition of dice adds a bit of randomness, but hey- you can never predict when a sea serpent will attack!

RATING: 7.5
I'm lowering my score for this one by one full point below the original.  When I first started playing Tsuro, I thought it needed something extra to keep it fresh.  After playing with the dragon mechanic, I now realize that I was wrong.  Tsuro is best left the way it is, in my opinion.  It's relaxing, easy, and quick.  Adding the dragons ruins all of that.  I will likely only use the dragons on special occasions.  I also tend to like the stones better than the ships.

I cannot say that this is better than the original.  The simplicity of Tsuro is part of the reason I love it.  This new version, although it can be played without the dragons, adds complexity.  That's a good thing and a bad thing.  With the addition of the dragons, there is more to worry about on the board than just your opponent.  That's good.  It adds more depth and tension to the gameplay.  But it also cuts into the flow of what is really just a very calm, straight forward, and simple starter, filler, or game for your average person who shuts down when there are too many choices to make in a game.  I do love the new artwork and it is nice to have the option to add that extra something to the game, but it is not enough to increase my score over the original.

What have they done? Tsuro was a fun game, a little chaotic, sure, but being able to squeeze a rules explanation and a couple of games into a quarter of an hour means you can forgive a lot.

Somebody has clearly taken a look at Tsuro and thought "How could we make this better?". Not a bad start, but you have to wonder what they were smoking when the answers they came up with were "make each turn last a lot longer" and "add completely random player elimination".

Turgid, boring and completely unrewarding. Gack!

What's the best way to take a great strategy game and make it more FUN?
**DICE** and **RANDOM PLAYER ELIMINATION**.

Roll dice to see where the Dragons appear!
Roll dice to see if the Dragons Move!
Roll dice to see where they move, which might mean they don't move!
Everyone gets to roll Dice!
Whee!!!

Imagine Chess with a new element - a pair of d8s that drop an indesctructible creature (lets call it a Dragon) onto the board and then randomly (sometimes, whether it moves is random too!) wanders the board and destroys any piece in its path.

Hands down this version of the game ruined an otherwise beautiful and elegant game.

I only keep this in the collection for my daughter.  She is young and currently can't read.  She finds this fun, but to be honest I like regular Tsuro better.  This one is WAY too luck based.  Nearly every time someone is eliminated it's because of random dragon movement.

RATING: 7
Adding the dragon tiles certainly changes up the game and forces you into more interesting decisions about how to move your ship around the board to stay safe. Even though it takes some dice rolling to manage the dragons each turn, it's all done pretty easily with a couple of rolls. Yes the dragons are added randomness into the game, but when you have a game as light as Tsuro it makes for some laughs and anticipation as people roll the dice each turn. This is a good game to end a gaming evening.

Tsuro of the Seas is a lovely game with a little more strategy than the original Tsuro.  We play 2 player games mostly. I imagine this one would get a little tense with all 8 boats on board! I have played original Tsuro, and definitely recommend Seas. You can play with or without the sea dragons, so without is basically same play as the original. Plus the pieces in Tsuro of the seas are gorgeous!

For as much as I enjoy Tsuro, this version of basically the same game loses all of the simple, elegant mechanics and fast play of the original.  While the core game is still there, I don't like the additional moving parts that makes me a fan of the orginal.

Tsuro, the base game, is still a great introductory/filler game that I still have in my collection as a great, light, low complexity puzzle game.

The 'Seas' expansion added unnecessary complexity, press your luck randomization, and fiddliness to the basic game.  I've seen some players get wiped out on turn 1 or 2.  Just bad.

Component wise, this game has nice ship figures, but reading the route cards are harder for me than the base game.

RATING: 7
Played twice. Beautiful components. Elegant game if played as the original, leaving the sea monsters out of it. I think i prefer it that way. The sea monsters add a lot of chaos and randomness and really drag the game out. But i don't hate them. This is the version i'll buy, so i have the option of playing with or without the monsters.

Kaiju!!!!! Category 5!

While I like the random nature of the Daikaiju, I dislike the rule that if they end up on the space in front of you, you are automatically devoured. 

I use the house rule that if the space in front of you contains a Daikaiju, and it is your turn. You may roll the dice to attempt to move the Daikaiju as normal. If you don't succeed, then you are devoured.

The game is just ok. The dragons random movement at times can backfire on your best strategy, which is not that great. Rules are simple but most players tend to not get that into the game.

Slightly better than Tsuro as you can play the original way or the new way.

The new way does add something different to the game that the original is missing but it drags the game out a lot longer and looses that easy-fast play without really adding much to the game.

I found the game relying on luck. The daikaiju are really all random and i personally lost by daikaiju moving on my square while waiting for my turn on my first turn twice in a row.
The concept is nice.. and the game in the end is nice but a very early elimination made me sit 40 minutes looking at others playing without even the possibility to blame myself for a mistake.
For a big number of players (bad on 2 and 3 players), probably funnier without the daikaiju

First things first -- this is a beautiful game with wonderful high-quality components and board. Second, I really love how this game is so creatively different than so many others, although a friend joked that it's like Chutes and Ladders for adults.

There's a debate about whether to get this "Seas" version or the original.  Here's my case for the "Seas" version:

>> I like the art and the theme of Seas better and most importantly, you can always easily play with the original rules by taking out the daikaiju (dragons) and cordoning off the 7x7 Seas board to 6x6 , or just play with the larger space.

>> As others have noted, the Seas rules with the addition of the dragons messes up the simplicity of the game with too much randomness and clunky gameplay.

We came up with some rule changes to keep the dragons in play (which, as an element, are actually quite fun) and still, keep the game moving:

1. Place the number of dragons, rolling the die for their locations, per the rules.

2. When it comes time to move a dragon -- on a roll of 6, 7, or 8 -- a player can move ANY one dragon, one space in ANY direction. Essentially, we ignore the numbers and arrows on the dragon tiles.

3. Dragon tiles can only be moved to open spaces, never displacing another tile or never moving off the board.

4. If a dragon comes up against a player's wake path and boat, it does NOT destroy the player immediately. Rather, at the start of that player's next turn, the player has a chance to roll a 6, 7, or 8 to move the dragon away, then lay a tile per normal and escape!

5. Roll a double 6, and the player slays the dragon and it's taken off the board.

6. And as others have suggested to speed up gameplay ... players draw just one tile instead of three and must play it (the only exception being if the tile forces a loss on the first turn -- then redraw).

These changes add some more excitement to the game, especially when you're attempting to escape the dragon. Also, moving a dragon becomes a lot more straightforward, speedy and less random.

My ranking takes account of these rule changes.

It's more of a party game than a real board game. Number of monsters on the board is much too big.

Otherwise, nothing special and too random.

The original Tsuro is a nice filler/icebreaker game that is great for opening or closing a game day/meet.  The artwork and components are beautiful and the length of that game hits that sweet-spot for what it is.  This sequel tries to be a more ‘advanced’ version by just throwing extra mechanisms on top of the original and basically just slows down and muddles a game that was really never designed to be anything more than a pleasant 10 or 15 minute gameday wind down or opening game day icebreaker.  If you are looking for a more ‘advanced’ version of Tsuro, I would recommend “Metro” by Queen Games.  
The last time I played this we actually gave up on it because our boats were literally going round and round in circles and we all had just had it with the game (and since there is player elimination, others were just sitting off to the side waiting for us to finish).

This game can be played with the same ruleset as Tsuro, as well as with the changes "of the Seas" portion of its rules.

Beautiful game, beautiful materials.

I like the new set of rules, but they do add a huge chaotic element.  This can knock you out of a game within the first turn or two, and that can be seen as a huge downside ~ especially if you're playing with more than two players and have to sit around and wait before playing it again.  Be wary if that's not your shtick... however, even if you're completely against arbitrary forces that are out to get you and you're considering this or Tsuro itself, get this, because it's pretty beautiful and you get the options to play with the new rules or just play with the original ruleset.

RATING: 2
The only redeeming aspect of "Tsuro of the Seas" is that you can play it as if it were plain "Tsuro" on a larger board (if you ignore the extra rules and components). For large numbers of players, this could make it a good option over the original, to slightly extend the amount of time you have before things get crowded.

The original game is a delightful design -- very simple, but extremely elegant with a great balance of luck and forward planning; fast enough to play that it never outstays its welcome, and unbelievably quick to set up and teach; it works well with almost any number of players; and as icing on the cake, it's beautiful to look at, and it's funny. In other words, it's pretty much the perfect filler game (and you should own it).

"Tsuro of the Seas" also has beautiful artwork and supports lots of players... but then, if you play with its additional rules, it proceeds to ruin everything else that was good about the original.

I mistakenly assumed that this came from the original designer, and so I took a leap of faith in buying it, trusting that it would be as elegant as its predecessor.

As it is, I can recommend this version ONLY if you wish to play "Tsuro" on a slightly larger board. If not, then know that less is more in this instance, and you should just buy the original game.

JUST WAIT! This looks great and all, but I can't help wondering:

If this is essentially Tsuro with only one small rule change (addition of sea monster tiles) and different artwork, why isn't the original designer of Tsuro credited?  And wouldn't his permission be needed to use his game's name in the title of this reimplemented version, and to use his gameplay concept?   I see that both games are from the same publisher, but the question remains...

While the randomness can potentially take a lot of the strategy out of the game, it also adds a lot of opportunities to prolong the game and have some really great decisions.  Sure, when a new monster lands right on your space, there's nothing you could do to prevent it, but at the same time, setting up a really daring path that skirts past a monster feels awesome when you pull it off.

For a light game, I find this one to be a ton of fun.

This can be played as normal tsuro or with the sea monsters added.

Normal tsuro with this is a little disappointing as the art work is not as nice and the dark blue lines on blue backgrounds are more difficult to read that the white lines on brown backgrounds of the original. 

The boat tokens are really large and don't really fit on the tiles very well.

Haven't played the sea monster variant but it seems like this is going to add chaos for the sake of chaos!

To much randomness, and that randomness slows down the basics of the game. I like the ship moving mechanic but as games get bigger the your are more likely to lose just due to pure chance rather than making bad decisions or being beaten by your opponents.

Very unsure about the rating here. I play this with original Tsuro rules, but on the bigger board of this game. I haven't tried playing with the monsters at all.

I bought this game to have something light for 8 players and it fits very well: Nice components, easy rules.

I haven't discovered much to think about in the game yet, but I still like playing it and seeing people have fun following the intricate paths created by the game and somtimes having a weirdly shaped tile that allows an escape from an otherwise hopeless position.

Very fun tile-laying game! Great for younger gamers because you can play without the daikaiju, just the wake tiles, to see who can stay on the board longest. Gameplay is fast and entertaining, so even if you're eliminated early it's fun to watch how the rest of the game goes, and it won't be long before starting a new one. Definitely recommend over the original Tsuro, if you have neither, because it can be played with original rules or with daikaiju.

Take the light and elegant Tsuro and do your best to cripple it with random complexity - this is Tsuro of the Seas.  One of the rare times I have abandoned the game and just play it like the original without the dragons.  But even in the mode, the ship pieces are too large and make it difficult to see what path you are on.  Just play the original and ignore this mess (Rating 2.425, Feb 17)

It's a little bit more wild and woolly than the regular Tsuro. Dragons do some interesting random things in the game and that adds to the fun. You can get unexpectedly taken out of the game by a dragon, but dragons can also destroy tiles that have been played giving players a way out of bad situations.

My comments on the original Tsuro below:

Tsuro is an extremely accessible game that combines area enclosure with a bit of "screw you." Each turn, a player will place a tile from his/her hand of three. This tile will be placed directly in front of his/her dragon piece. The dragon must then follow the newly created path as far as possible. The goal is to stay alive as long as possible by not following a path that sends your dragon into another dragon or off the board. 

In practice, you will need to strategize about when to place your tougher pieces (the ones with similar sides and thus less options). You may find it more worthwhile to kill an opponents dragon even if it puts your dragon in a less useful position. It's ideal if you can close a section off for just your dragon to use, because as the board fills up, there is no escape from death. This creates a very nice tension between wanting to stay out of the middle where there are bound to be lots of dragons, but also to stay away from the sides which are death if you run into them.

It scales surprisingly well with 2-8 players, though with more players there is definitely more chaos. You can lose some control by virtue of the fact that 7 tiles will be placed before you get another turn. That said, dragons die very quickly with that many players, so when the smoke clears, the end game is often very exciting. It's a very light game, but it plays quickly and I'm happy to play it as a filler before/after a heavier game.

Now, as for Tsuro of the Seas, the main addition is that there are sea monsters that will move in random directions and potentially also remove your playing piece. The multiplayer chaos of Tsuro and the randomness of the tile draws is already enough. Adding a die roll after every turn slows things down and just adds more randomness, This is not an improvement, in fact quite the opposite. Tsuro works because of its speed and simplicity but this version undermines both of those things. This doesn't make Tsuro of the Seas a terrible game, but there is no reason to play it over the original.

RATING: 5
Game is beautiful and starts off with the simple mechanics of the original, but adds dragons that fly around (randomly) which you cannot plan for this and they caused many of the players in our round to lose outside of their planning and control.

Unfortunately, it is not as good as the original: which was a fast game that is both light and can be a brain-buster too.  

This is far too random and not my cup of tea.  That said, i think families/casual gamers which like the original may enjoy it - so long as the randomness is not a limiting factor.

RATING: 6
Whereas the original Tsuro was quick and easy, this version adds the complication rolling dice to add a random element. I don't think this enhances the game. You can be eliminated by the roll of dice and the whole process makes the game drag. Luckily, you can play the original game with this version; just use the path tiles and ignore the rest.

This has the same mechanics as Tsuro more or less. The board is one row/column bigger, to allow for the potential addition of sea monsters. Sea monsters CAN(but don't always) move. When they do, they swallow anything or anyone in the space they move to. Also, you can't die by colliding with other players, like in regular Tsuro. My personal preference leads more towards the original Tsuro.

RATING: 9
Very cool tile laying game, with interesting mechanics: the daikaju (albeit a bit fiddly). Gorgeous board, thick tiles, very good production overall. Works well for 2P, but favours more 3+ (the game gets more intense and chaotic at the same time). Control freaks will prolly hate it because there's certainly (a lot) more luck involved in this game compared to let's say Indigo: the daikaju movement can take you out of the game in one go, while a couple of bad dice rolls will fill the board with angry beasts in no time - but that's precisely what makes Tsuro so exciting! So don't take the dragons out of the game, unless you want to take all the fun away as well. For the right crowd, Tsuro of the Seas is just awesome!

I had high hopes for Tsuro of the Seas, but ultimately felt unsatisfied by a game that relies too heavily upon luck. Despite its apparent facade as a game based in strategy, the random movement of the daikaiju monsters can alter the outcome entirely. In the multiple games that I played, the chaotic daikaiju decided every victor. What's the point in planning a strategy when you could get kicked out at any moment? Even the play variant where you remove the daikaiju is just a boring game of keep away until someone makes a mistake. This was such a let down.

Sail around a grid map in your tiny boat. Avoiding the monstrous dragons, plot your course with foresight. If you sail into your opponents wake you could end up in a precarious situation. Trying to stay on the seas while disrupting your opponents is the goal.

Play without the dragons for a more strategic, zen-like experience. Add in the dragons for some nail biting dice rolling.

I have heard Tsuro was a good game. Perhaps this is the biggest disappointment of the year for me. We played without the daikaiju tiles so I believe I actually played vanilla Tsuro instead of this, but I will write my comment here because this was the edition I played. This is an awful game, in fact there is barely a game here, you have very easy/obvious decisions each turn with lots of uncontrollable luck. ZERO strategy. Not even the short playtime can save the game/activity for me. Zero replay value. I’m amazed Tsuro is so well ranked. Very boring game, zero interest, zero fun. 

The only redeeming factor is that the game is really gorgeous. Also I have yet to try the daikaiju tiles, but I don’t think they can save the game for me.

Perhaps as a two player game there is actually a game of some kind here, but I’m not willing to find out. I will play anything twice so I will play again, but when I do, I fear the rating will go down even further.

At least you can play without them and for that reason it is boosted from a 1.

The concept and visual aspect of Tsuro of the Sea are so cool, and the components and printing are fantastic.  Better than the orginal Tsuro, IMHO.  The basic game play is fun, but some of the rules need refinement (maybe revision would be a better word) for the game to play to its potential.  

We also have the promo tiles with the tsunami, whirlpool and cannons.  The cannons are definitely a positive addition which provides welcome relief when encountering dragons.  In hindsight, it might have been good to include cannons as part of the original game--in fact, maybe even adding a few more of them. 

I know others on the forum have discussed some of their personal "house rules" and rule revision ideas in separate threads.  Our family starts out with only 1-3 dragons on the board, no matter how many players we have, and we roll for new placement of a dragon if it would arbitrarily land on a ship, knocking it out of the game.  A cannon might prevent this of course, too. Another change we've tried is to allow players to hold four wake tiles in hand, providing more chances for getting a cannon and more tactical options.  

One of the strategic things we've noticed is that the dragons are limited to the central section of the game board when they are first introduced.  This causes players to try to keep their ships on the very edge of the board for as long as possible, unlike the original Tsuro, where game play is much more open and allows more use of the entire board.

I know the designers must have done many test plays before they released this game, but the rules still seem a little too arbitrary and need tweaking to make the game play more smoothly and logically...since Tsuro is considered to be an abstract strategy game. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.4
Tsuro is a game I really enjoyed when I played.  Tsuro of the Seas takes it up a few steps and changes the game slightly and, in my opinion, for the better.  Adding in the movement of the dragons may make for a less strategic game, but it definitely adds to the fan factor as well.  Never quite knowing how things will turn out from the end of your turn to the beginning of your next really makes it interesting.  If you take it to seriously, you'll have a bad time, but if you just go with it, there's a really great game in this box, even better than its predecessor.

I like Tsuro all right. It's a good, light game to bring out with a big group of people. It's not really a party game, but it can be played like one. This version introduces four dragons to the board, which also means instant death to any who connect to them. Each turn players roll dice to see if a dragon moves and then roll again to see which direction it moves in. Last player standing wins.

The dice rolling and moving dragons tends to extend what should be a very short game. Also, dragons not only kill, they can also help by removing already-placed tiles, which could also extend the game. I rate regular Tsuro a point higher than this version, but really the games are very similar. I just prefer the shorter play time and simplicity of the original.

RATING: 7
I love the new mechanics introduced in this version of Tsuro, it makes the game more challenging.
It also makes the game go for longer, once you've played a few games you start moving the Daikaiju (Sea dragons) a lot more efficiently, but when you get down to the last two players, the game starts to really stretch out. Which I find annoying to the players that have been eliminated, because they just have to sit and watch.
Having said that, players seem to have a completely different gameplay from the original. Where players would try to avoid each other, they now begin to work with each other to help avoid the Daikaiju. At least with the different gamers I've played with.
This version doesn't doesn't work as well as a game breaker/opener like the original does, because of the time it takes and how long the eliminated players have to wait for the game to finish. But if you want new elements of challenge and something more interesting than the original, this works really well.

I think we would have enjoyed it more without the sea monsters (basic Tsuro), which made things a bit unbalanced. When a game can end on round 1, there’s a problem. This was a themed game that goes back to the idea of trying to keep moving your ship along lines as long as possible without sailing off the edge or running afoul of a sea monster.
I loved the theme and the art, but not so much the sea monsters.

Tsuro with sea monsters!  :-D  I prefer this one to the original game.  Several dragons drift around the board based on dice rolls, so you never know where they will head each turn.  If you bump into one, you are out!  Good filler game with very nice components.  Pretty game!

This game has it all! It's easy to learn, fast paced so it doesn't take hours to play, and it has a level of anticipation that keeps the game interesting and a race to stay alive! In this game you go against other players to stay on the board and not get eaten by the daikaiju (dragons) but with each dice roll someone will get closer and closer to their inevitable loss. This game is also a great introduction game for new boardgamers and its family friendly with a little dash of competitiveness! There can only be one winner!

When we're playing with new gamers who may be intimidated by our more intense games, this is the game we always bring. Tsuro of the seas is a simple game with a lot of random chance but is surprisingly fun (especially so if you play with a group who will get into the fun theme of the game). Plays fast and with a lot of people making it a great game for any party.

Nekem nagyon tetszik. Ezek a daikaiju lapkák még több véletlenszerűséget visznek a játékba, de szerintem érdekes, muszáj figyelembe venni őket a tervezésekkor, persze olyan is van, hogy egyszerűen szerencsétlenül jön ki a lépés. A játék hangulata és gyorsasága miatt valahogy mégsem fáj. :)

Standard Tsuro was frustratingly random to begin with: adding dragon tiles that stomp randomly around the board (including a potential insta-kill if one spawns on top of your boat) just seems like a bad joke.

I don't understand the hate this game has gotten in the comments.  The components are beautiful and the game play is fantastic.  If you don't like the dragons, just don't use them.  It plays the same as the original game without them.  In my opinion, if you are on the fence between this and the original, get this edition.  At least it comes with the option to add the dragons if you wish.

Re-implementation

The basic game play of Tsuro of the Seas resembles that of Tom McMurchie's Tsuro: Players each have a ship that they want to sail — that is, keep on the game board — as long as possible. Whoever stays on the board the longest wins the game.

Each turn players add "wake" tiles to the 7×7 game board; each tile has two "wake connections" on each edge, and as the tiles are placed on the board, they create a connected network of paths. If a wake is placed in front of a ship, that ship then sails to the end of the wake. If the ship goes off the board, that player is out of the game.

What's new in Tsuro of the Seas are daikaiju tiles, representing sea monsters and other creatures of the deep. On the active player's turn, he rolls two six-sided dice; on a sum of 6, 7, or 8, the daikaiju will move, while on any other sum they'll stay in place. To determine which direction the daikaiju tiles move, the player then rolls one die. On 1-5, the tile either rotates or moves in a specific direction. On a 6, a new daikaiju tile is added to the board.

I really enjoyed the original [gameid=16992] for the feeling it inspired while playing, a zen like maze introspection. This new implementation of that game seems to just take away from that feeling while adding a number of gamey elements to make the game seem like it has more going on, while at the same time increasing the play time from what should be a 5-10 minute experience. The miniatures that are included in the game, while nicely detailed are also just a complete useless addition to a game that doesn't need them. The artwork for each dragon also are just like a high school boys pencil drawings. All in all I would say this fails at doing right everything that the original Tsuro did to win fans.

The game is good for its kind.  It uses original mechanics, good components, nice theme.  I just personally dislike the fact that it is very much a game of heavy chance, last man standing, with the focus on the elimination and misery of other players.  Even playing with the nicest players I did not enjoy it enough to wish to play out again.  I would rather play a pure gambling game like Manila for this genre.

The problem with this game is that there is far too much book keeping.  Each time you lay 1 tile, you have to randomly move 5 or more dragon tiles, so you spend way more time adjusting the game state that actually playing the game

The "neutral" sea monsters are an interesting twist, but they (and a bigger grid) make the game somewhat longer - which might be a bad thing, if someone falls out early.
It is a good flavor of the game, I just can't decide if I like this more... or the original Tsuro. I can say for sure that original Tsuro is easier in seeing the paths on the tile, the waves make it somehow messy in few cases.

The original looks prettier, but also less thematic. The monsters in this are nice to look at, though.

The Sea Monsters have turned Tsuro into a randomised chaos fest! Whereas in the oringial game you had a limited ability to plan your move in order to avoid elimination, now you can be trashed by a radnom dice roll! 
Even the rules have to include a get out for you not being able to take your first move due to a Sea Monster! When the rules have to include this sort of caveat you just know there is something seriously wrong with the game.

I was introduced to Tsuro by a couple of friends and was immediately absorbed by the simple and elegant gameplay. Play a tile, follow the path to the end and make sure that it doesn't lead out from the game board. That's really everything you need to know!

Tactically, your choices are limited to three tiles on hand to choose from every turn and this is quite enough to create a fast game. Nevertheless, you still have interesting options to choose from. Should you try to hide in a corner? Should you block other players' access to "your" tiles? Should you attack in the center to throw out an opponent? Each new game will bring a new answer!

Tsuro of the Seas adds another dimension to an already great game through the unpredictable dragons or daikaijus. Play the classic Tsuro without them or try to stay away not only from the other players but also the dragons. This is a game I'll bring to every game night as a filler between games!

A filler game that really is quite fun to play. Literally, have only one thing to do (Place a tile), but the strategy gained from that alone can either make you a winner or screw someone else's path by driving them into a Daikaiju (Dragon). 

Can be a quick game if you start near someone, or can take a while thinking about all the possible outcomes and looking towards the following turns taking advantage of all the already played tiles.

A fun family game.  You place tiles to move your boat around, and try not to fall off the edge of the board.  This version of Tsuro adds dragons that move around that you need to avoid.

The dragons add some unpredictability,  which can be nice.  It makes It less of a chess match, and a little easier for all ages to compete. It does add a few extra steps to each turn, though.

Another great game for both young and old people that's pretty simple to get into.  This one feels a little less reliant on play order for whether you're going to win than the original Tsuro.

Rounds can last quite a bit longer than the original Tsuro if everybody's luck holds out.

You can play the base game with this so it auto-kills Tsuro, and gets the same rating and comment: This game fills the niche of opener for 5-8 people for 15 minutes while you're waiting for others to arrive and for that it's successful. It's simple and fast, and can produce fun moments when you join up with someone else. It gets a fair bit of play as a result, but people are ready to move on after a game as it's little more than froth.

Adding the sea-dragons turns a pretty random game into a very random game, where people can just get eliminated based on a die roll (which dictates where the sea-dragons move and get added). Adding that die roll to every turn slows the game down as well, so double-plus-bad. Use this expansion bit for variety I guess, because who cares who wins such a light game anyway, and if everyone's of that same mind it can generate some fun. But I think the over-randomness and slower turns detracts from the game's raison d'etre.

Elegant, but of a different kind than of original Tsuro. Neat game, but not great. More stressful than original Tsuro. Wonderful board art is distracting.

Major disappointment.  the simplicity of tsuro destroyed.   Add one dragon, and it might be interesting...6 in a 3 player game and it was suicidal for us all....better game cutting number of dragons in half.

Added 8/16/15:  I have played this two more times and have upgraded my rating from 5.0 to 6.5.  It is not horrible, although the things I said above are still true.  It is a very different game from Tsuro, and goes from being an very good strategical game with a minor luck element, to an chaotic game of survival where luck accounts for 90% of one's success (or failure).  Once you know what to expect and are prepared for the fates that await you, the game is both playable and potentially competitive.  In one 4 player game, I was eliminated early, but two players were able to survive for a long time as the daiku did not seem to be interested in their ships.

Tsuro is a good filler. Tsuor of the Seas adds a terrible mechanic of random dragons moving around and messing with people. Bogs the game down and makes a game that has the right level of randomness too random.

Why? Why??????? Tsuro was light and worked well for large groups, non-gamers, or families. Now we needed dragons to add more randomness and chaos? In our first round, we ended up with 5 dragons on the board. One player died before he got a second turn. Nope nope nope. The original was just okay, but this version should be tossed in the sea.

RATING: 6
I actually prefer Tsuro without the sea monsters, because I think they can knock players out too early.

I don't know if I should rate Tsuro of the Seas a 9 as well, only because you can play Tsuro with it? But then again, I also think Tsuro is prettier than this, (I'm not saying TotS (=D) is ugly, either.) and in this case I think it is a big deal.

I didn't like the sound of the changes that this make to Tsuro. Now that I have played it, it is truly awful.
Adding sea monsters controlled by dice sounds bad and it is, even on the larger board. It makes the game too random.
I wouldn't even play the non-monster variant as the extra tiles compared to the original (7x7 instead of 6x6) don't improve things.
Avoid.

The art work here is pretty pretty, and the game play is OK. But at the end of the day, this is quite an abstract game -- you don't really feel like you're sailing a ship in anyway, and there's no thematic reason for why your ship has to sail the paths it does. More chaotic with more players, but that can be a good thing here

RATING: 8
By purchasing this version, you can play either the original Tsuro or Tsuro of the Seas.  If you have neither, and are considering between the two, selecting this version is an easy choice.

I expected the inclusion of the dragons with the extra upkeep they bring to make the game drag more than the original.  What I found was that the upkeep for the dragons goes very quickly and the overall length of the gae was probably SHORTER than the original.

However, it should be noted that the dragons include a random element to a game that originally had very little "chance" involved.  The net effect is a pretty steep reduction in strategic control.  That said, you can always reduce the number of dragons at the beginning to mitigate the restore some of that strategic control.

The perfect example of where bigger is not always better.  Tsuro of the Seas is a sequel to the original Tsuro, and features the same tile placement gameplay and beautiful artwork.  However, Tsuro of the Seas makes a few tweaks that seem to open the game up to more fun, but rather just make it an unwieldy beast instead of a light, quick filler.  

The first change is the board is one grid row bigger on both axes.  This alone can make for a longer game, as there is more space to fill.  The daikaiju are the biggest change, though: monster tiles that are dropped onto the board and moved around via dice rolls.  They consume anything in their path, including tiles and player pieces, which knocks you out of the game.  This adds an element of luck to the game that can be frustrating, when a kaiju comes down right on top of you and you're helpless.  Also, the eating of the wake tiles means the game can continue on longer as those tiles are placed yet again.  

All of this pushes the playtime to around the 45 minute range.  For most games, that's perfect, but Tsuro's light and fast gameplay is ideal for about 20 minutes max, and when it is stretched out in Tsuro of the Seas, the game feels tedious, random, and much less satisfying.  

A final, minor quibble is the player pieces.  They are Japanese boats and look cool, but they are way too long for the tiles and feel pretty awkward.  I think I will combine my Tsuro and Tsuro of the Seas into one box, so I can use the larger board for normal Tsuro play (and with the dragon tokens, not the boats).  A fun game, but a step down from its elegant predecessor.

Tsuro is already dull and mostly random on its own, but along come dragons to add even more randomness and ways for you to be eliminated through no fault of your own.

Getting killed because a player maliciously placed a tile to cause you to crash is funny. Getting killed because a die roll randomly moved a dragon? Not so much.

Great quality components, but the Kaiju all feel the same and the specified number add a huge random factor to the game.
I really wanted to like this out of the box, but we didn't, and we played several times to ensure it wasn't just a fluke.
This is fine to play the original Tsuro with, or to introduce perhaps ONE Kaiju at the beginning and then follow the rules that may bring a couple more in as the game progresses.
For a deeper strategic game, house-rule the various Kaiju with your own movement tables so they behave differently, then you can gauge whether to go in front of or behind one.

This is the bigger, lesser brother to Tsuro. The bigger board is fine & I enjoy having special tiles in the deck (Weee teleports), I even enjoy the paths getting destroyed and opening up new actions during gameplay.

Sadly, faffing about with rolling dice and figuring out what they cause ruins the game, and the randomness factor of where the dragons go brings in an element of 'sucks to be you, because RNG'.

I would love to see an implementation with a bunch more unique tiles and new ways for paths to get cleared which didn't involve the dice or random death.

Oh, Tsuro of the Seas!  What a great addition those daikaiju sea monsters are to the basic Tsuro setup.  Without them, you can still play straightforward Tsuro:  Game of the Path, just with a nautical theme.  However - with daikaiju added, it's a frenetic time of luck and adaptive tactics as you desperately try to stay on your wake path the longest without being eaten or washed off the board.  Vanilla Tsuro can sometimes run down to the last few tiles laid, especially with experienced players.  By contrast, Tsuro of the Seas does have a higher chance of early player elimination because of the fitful daikaiju.  I don't think its a major problem however, because games tend to be fast.  Every game I've played has lasted less than 30 minutes, including when playing with 5 players.  Scales well so far.  Highly recommended.

RATING: 2.5
Wow. Tsuro of the Seas ruined literally everything Tsuro did well. Board is ugly and difficult to read, tiles are unclear, and the dragons and dice are a disaster. The beauty of Tsuro was its simplicity and the low downtime between turns. Before every turn, now you have to roll to determine whether one of the 4-6 dragons on the board move. You have a 45% chance to have them move. Then you must roll a dice individually for each one in an arbitrary order and determine where they go. Creates way too much downtime and too much staring at the board trying to figure it out. Regular Tsuro is much, much better.

RATING: 3
Tsuro is a simple, elegant abstract filler that scales quite well (negligible downtime and more targets). Perhaps the cleverest part of the design is that it can never slow down: as more of the board is filled, each new placement either leads to an empty space or death.

Tsuro of the Seas takes everything good about the original game and ruins it. Instead of a simple "place a tile, move ships, draw a tile" turn, a new phase is added: roll two dice, and on an outcome of 6-8 move each of the daikaiju (giant monster) tiles, again by rolling a die. Not only does this mechanism in itself slow down the game -- adding multiple dice rolls -- the daikaiju also destroy previously placed tiles by moving over them, re-opening the board. In addition to significantly increasing randomness and introducing the possibility that a player can be destroyed by capricious random numbers before they get a turn, what should be a quick filler instead [i]drags on[/i].

An astonishingly terrible step backwards. Play it without the monsters or don't play it at all.

Whatever this game has, it's something I love. The best part is that you can play original Tsuro on the same board with the available components. I'm so glad that I waited for this one.

I finally got my copy of Tsuro of the Seas on closeout and it did not disappoint.

Works as a light filler.
A decent filler but with so much luck (using monsters) that I'm not convinced it's worth anyones time. As a activity to engage in whilst everyone is chatting I think it works but as a game, not so much. My 2nd place would have been first but for the fact that the other player who was trapped and wouldn't survive 2 turns rolled a new monster directly in front of me. Lame! but honestly I felt worse for the players who were knocked out even earlier due to no fault of their own. Would still be happy to play it again.

A great game, but perhaps not as simplistically fun as its older brother Tsuro.  I love Tsuro, Tsuro of the seas adds a little bit of complexity and fun randomness with dragons trying to kill you, it makes it more interesting, but at the end of the day I think while you gain much with this version of Tsuro, what you gain is not at the level of the base game.  The art is also, while pretty, not as elegant and color wise more tacky.  I feel like this is more a 7.5 and not an 8, but I will give it the benefit of the doubt.

This is a light game but perfect for ages as young as 7 or 8. There is not much downtime and is one of the few 8 player games that can hold the interest of a child yet still be engaging for adults. Rated as a 9 from a family viewpoint. When playing with younger players, reduce the number of Daikaiju down or remove them altogether.

An extremely light game; at least it's time efficient? The art is nice too. It makes for a good benchmark for comparison to games that might be wastes of time.

At least it's a safe, pretty game you can play with kids and benighted adults, without being as blatantly neon and deterministic as Candy Land.

This is a really good game for when playing with people intimidated by strategy or when I just need a light game. The theme and artwork are really cool plus you get the joy of making a dragon eat another player's ship. Luck is a big part of this game but there is just enough strategy to keep me interested.

Sure, you can get eliminated early and take actions no worse than any other play.  But the combination of the tiles and the monsters is just so much fun.

Playing by ourselves isn’t too engaging—with kids it’s more fun for sure. Aiming to fill the board as much as possible does add a little more challenge.

RATING: 4
Dragons? Why, oh, dear, why? Ok, I'm sure that if you are in a boat, and a dragon comes in your way, you will say something similar, probably with more cursing in between. But here, in the confort of my house, I say this because the dragons are a bad, really bad addition to an otherwise good game.

The dragons mostly add two things: uncontrollable randomness and time. The randomness comes from the movement of the dragons, which is dice based, but this part the player can at least try to stay away from the dragons, so it isn't all that uncontrolled. But then there is the random way they enter the board: by the roll of two dice, accordingly to the numbers, the dragons enter. It can enter right in front of a player, who now has to pray for it to move (and not in her direction) or she simply is out of the game. Or, to cut the hope, the dragon can simply appear in the exact place someone is: the player is eliminated.

The time is added because, if the dragons move upon a tile, it takes it out, and the tile goes to the bottom of the draw pile. So, this acts against the big lines that toss people out of the board. Sure, the dragons are there to also eliminate, but this is mostly true when they are near, but, sometimes, they are away, just trashing tiles and doing little more. Also, the player have to roll the dice to see if the dragons will move, then, if they will, a die for the movement, and finally move those on the board. This obstruct the flow of the game a lot.

Now, you [b]can[/b] [thing=124172][/thing] as regular [thing=16992][/thing], just using the pieces, board and tiles. This is neat. This reimplementation also adds some special tiles, which can be good, but I haven't played with them yet, so the jury is still out.

Even with this, by principle, I will rate this game as a 5, while [thing=16992][/thing] is a 7, by nothing more than to speak against the dreadful decision to add the dragons mechanics - you just fumbled adding [b][u]dragons[/b][/u] to something! This is when you know you have failed bad, really bad.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Not sure how to rate this. Little of value here but it's also painless and easy to play. Randomly draw tiles with routes on them to try to guide your boat piece away from obvious (and randomly moving) obstacles.

The group I played this with seemed to think this was better than plain Tsuro (which I've not played) because this was harder. I can't really believe "Seas" takes any more thought (more process, sure, but not more thought); I wonder if the issue is that Tsuro's early game is uneventful, or something, and the dragons give you something to worry about basically immediately.

Actually on second thought the implementation of the dragons (random appearance and movement) is sufficiently offensive to my tastes that I will dock the rating a bit further.

Perhaps its merely the way the game is designed, but the game board is awful and inexcusable. The wavy patterns of the board can induce epileptic seizures and makes tile-laying that much more difficult. Why oh why did they decide to confuse the players such?

Was looking forward to getting this because I love the artwork and the central mechanic.  However, this edition is even more chaotic than the original.  Game looks great, but after two plays I was done with it.  As with regular Tsuro, why play this when you can play Indigo which has less chaos and more interesting decisions?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's Tsuro, but with more options and a (to my mind) better theme, though I can see arguments for the zen-like abstract of the original. The little ship minis are great, and you don't have to play with the Daikaiju if you don't like them.

Tsuro itself is an interesting exercise in theming - I can totally see it being marketed as "The Squiggle Game" (Wacky!), but somehow putting a zen veneer on it makes it something that's acceptable to play with other adults. 

One downside vs the original is that the larger board probably makes for a looser game with fewer players.

Anyhow, Mom seems to like it, and anything I can play with her is good in my book.

I like the art on this version, but would never ever recommend playing with the extra rules. They roughly double the length of the game by adding multiple dice rolls to resolve non-decision related bookkeeping whose sole purpose is to randomly eliminate players. On top of that, the rotation of units that already have an equally random chance at moving in all directions just reiterates the issue- you're literally rotating them to accomplish nothing.

My rating reflects how I feel about this game when playing with those changes.

Bought for 10 € from a thrift store.

I bought this only because it was so cheap and since I knew it would be easy to teach to new gamers. I hadn't enjoyed basic Tsuro too much when I tried it for the first time so I didn't expect this version to light any sparks. For a week I even contemplated selling it.

Nonetheless, nowadays Tsuro of the Seas has established a place on my shelf. My non-gamer relatives don't enjoy it but I've grown a liking to this game somehow... Maybe it's the ships? Or the bigger board? Quality pieces?

I don't know, exactly.

Have it at work. I've tried to like it, but it's just so much work at the beginning of your turn to work out the dragons, before you put down one tile. That really drags on the time, that and the rulebook is not written that well with a fair few amiguities. I might try it with more vanilla Tsuro rules (no dragons) and see if it's any better.

I like this game because it is very unique but it is not something I look forward to playing. Tsuro of the Seas is a better choice to pick over the classic version Tsuro because this game is the same with the addition of dragons (and an optional expansion). Thankfully, the dragons are set up so that if you wanted to you could just remove the dragons from play and pretend like you were playing the original version of Tsuro. I have noticed, however, that this game isn't necessarily for everyone. I can easily see someone getting bored especially with the player elimination. Competition doesn't really shine through so much in this game as you are more just trying to outlast the other players and that typically shows by avoiding each player's ship.

This game does have a niche - the 2-3 player experience. As you'll notice if you've played Tsuro, at lower playercounts, you are very engaged at the beginning, eventually both get boxed in, and squiggle around for the rest of the game within that box, hoping your box is bigger and that you can manage to use all of it. Tsuro of the Seas adds the chance to get unboxed via the NPCs eating your path, and the chance to die via NPC instead of the only two other ways you can die that basically never happen in low player games. This fixes the experience! You can also play it as regular Tsuro when you hit the higher playercounts. Don't ever get the original, get this.

Happily Mingfang didn't find Tsuro, when shopping for a present. While the pieces and board in [gameid=16992] are prettier, I like the extra randomness of the daikaiju. They also bring a bit of flavour to the game. I realise that  the strengths of [gameid=16992] are lightness and easy setup. I will probably leave out the daikaiju when introducing the game to someone.

Original Tsuro is a bit simple in it's mechanics and as such gets boring quickly. This mixes it up but it does so in such a way that random luck plays a HUGE part in whether you are eliminated or not. I find it near impossible to try and mitigate this and use skill to win. Still OK but feel it could have been made to be much better.

We like it but it's story line is weak.
We have an idea for Tsuro of the seas' story and game play.

Since we are to spread the word of the Emperor, perhaps
our ships need to sail to each of the 4 corners of the world...board.

Touching all four corners,  wins the game.
If all players but one are eliminated, the eliminated player STILL
controls a dragon on their turn (see below) thereby still participating
in the game

The dragons count should be limited. We can work on that.
AND since we are all powerful, each of us could choose on their turn to
'move' one or d6 dragon(s) instead of rolling the dice to move all of them. 

It's as if our mighty Emperor gave us power over the dragons...albeit a bit limited .

We will try this new variation.

This seemed dumb at first but it actually becomes pretty interesting once there's quite a few wake tiles on the board. A fine light-game good to play as a one off once in a while.

Played it again after a while, I didn't like the fact that players can have next to no agency at times. Dragons fall from the sky or you get stuck with poor tiles and die. There are scores of better games than this.

I like the original Tsuro a lot because it plays fast and you can plan your moves.  This game adds more complexity and slows down the pace while making it more chaotic and harder to plan.  Now it is often impossible to plan your move until you roll the dice and you can be knocked out of the game on a whim despite your plans.  Kids might enjoy the new mechanics, but this is a less satisfying game for adults.

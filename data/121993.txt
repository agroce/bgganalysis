I like the choices that you make during the game--and the game feels a little fresh--but it's nothing to knock my socks off.  The dual-use of cards is neat, but it feels chaotic when everyone is planning on getting the same cards as you.

Filler de cartas majete, como tantos otros. Mejor con más de dos jugadores. Aunque entretenido, quizá no lo suficientemente original y, en definitiva, olvidable.

A pretty simple game with some interesting mechanisms. It is a bit too random for my taste as your turn is heavily influenced by the previous players' action.

A fast and light set collection game that packs a little more punch than apparent at first sight. Deciding when to take coins and make ingredients cheaper for other players, when to buy, and when to go for endgame VPs (the woks) is not quite as easy as it seems at first. Solid.

Karten-Zutaten für den Karten-Wok. Der Einkaufsmechanismus ist meinem Spiel-Geschmack zu simpel, das Ausspielen der Karten und Füllen der Asia-Pfanne ist dagegen ganz fein und läutet sanft das Ende des Spieleabends ein (Reim).

A simple but enjoyable card game filler. Each turn either take money, buy ingredients or take a wok (= score) card. While Bleasdale is mostly known for Keyflower, his other games show that he's regularly testing with Knizia and has learned a lot how to design small smooth family market games.

I like the dutch auction system with set collection. However, various point cards turn me off. It can be very unbalanced depends on these cards. Also the scoring is quite messy.

Collecting ingredients for filling tickets does not sound that special at first sight. There are two essential twists, though: The money system is rather unique. Also, there are more tickets than are used in a session, and all available tickets are face up on the table and can be purchased by anyone. 

Menzel has tried to imitate a Bohnanza style look, with not very convincing results. Fits the theme anyway.

Completely ridiculous box size. Rating will rise if this ever comes in Amigo size.

Nice light medium game, where timing is crucial because you really don't wanna leave any gifts for your opponents. But at about 1/3 of your turns the games plays itself as you're short of money, so you just have to chose the right row of money.

One of the better new-to-me fillers I played at Essen 2012, despite the repulsive art. It's a kind of double set-collection game. First you buy ingredient cards from rows using a clever money-management system, then you use sets of those to buy 'woks' which score points for particular combinations of ingredients.

On the board you find a track going in rounds. On some places there is poop. All players travel behind eachother in group accompanied by a rhinoceros and a bear.

Players each play simultaneously a card numbered 0 to 11. Then the players, with the highest numbers first step out of the group and move to the front of the group. But if there are multiple players playing the same number then only the player who is furthest back moves. When you step into the poop you get penalty points.
The row is always closed by a rhinoceros and when he suddenly notices that nobody is directly in front of him, he is going to run! And because a rhino has bad sight, he does not slow down in time. So a player will get a rhino in the back, resulting in penalty points.

The more players you have, the more fun playing this game is. The game contains some beautiful figures! Tip if you have a good table occupied.

--Nov2013-- Very cute.  Not the artwork so much; but the decisions are really quite cool.  Does one grab an extra coin and give the next player a cheap buy?  Or go early for the woks one wants?  Is collecting a huge pile of coins viable?  After playing only once, it seemed there was a lot of tactical space that we'd not yet visited.  Very happy to play again.

(playtest comment) The pseudo dutch auction system here is lovely - balancing the risk vs reward can be tense, and making the bonus cards work requires a bit of longer term planning.  A fine heavier filler.

This has gained an extra rating point from me for the tremendous puns and card art in the final version even if the theme itself is paper-thin.

I had fun with this, but I think it was less due to the game itself and more due to having fun with Jon and Rich.

I'll gladly play it, but I have not need to own it.

RATING: 7
Enjoyably quick-moving auction / set-collecting cardgame, where the 'auction' is dutch style: either take a coin or pay to match remaining coins to take a group of cards. These cards then are used both to buy target cards and (at game end) to satisfy those targets.

The variety of scoring options makes for a slightly hesitant first play but probably improves replayability.

The bizarro mashup Chinese food / pop stars theme takes some beating.

RATING: 6.3
This felt like an older game that has been around since the 90s and the artwork supported this.

Either take money, which makes a set cheaper, buy a set which makes the others more expensive, or play some hand cards on to the table and take a wok which is how you score points.

Perfectly functional, and probably would have been more highly regarded if we hadn't played it during Essen.

This is Ok, but on several turns you can have little choice in terms of what you can do..

RATING: 7.5
Incredibly odd set-up of mechanics that work really well, dumping companies on other players and going bankrupt are out but companies can go director less, insolvent, bankrupt and refloated (ironically published by JKLM), you can own 100% of your own companies and buying trains across is more difficult in conventional terms, there can be big jumps in share price too. 

Have to learn just to play this stand-alone, works well from 2 - 4 but they are very different, the two player game is a lot to take in with so much control over so many companies. Lots of ways to end the game, you can run good companies and end on share price maxing out or bank breaking, or run them in to the ground (usually not intentionally I imagine) and have nationalisation rules kick in and have your best companies survive longest to make the most money.

I'm glad the Isle of Wight is so small, but there’s a lot happening.

RATING: 9
Preliminary rating. A bit fiddly in regards to constantly recalculating routes, especially in the endgame. I haven't figured out how to make money off of receivership yet. These two things combined have had our plays run about six hours which seems too long compared to what others report. I feel like I'm missing something.

Update: After a fourth play where I engaged in more company dumping and the game saw two bankruptcies I feel like we are finally seeing the brilliance of the design, even if just a little.

I feel like this could be a 10 but the chrome is kind of obnoxious and it makes basic stuff like calculating routes a major pain in the ass. Also, there are so many optional rules I wonder what the "real" version of 1860 is, which annoys me. I feel like rules should be rules, not a list of stuff you can do if you feel like it.

It seems to me that despite some significant tweaks to the base system, 1860 retains the virtues and faults of other games in this series.  The early game is full of interest in terms of the buying and dumping of shares and of network building.  The end game can really drag; with all significant buying and building done we wait for the end of the game to trigger (in one of three ways in 1860). 

Most noteworthy of the significant tweaks is the ability to sell all a company's stock to the bank.  I rather like this as it makes the play that bit more free-wheeling. Gone is the requirement to buy a train for a company without one; the bank will step in and lease it one until enough company credit accrues to enable a purchase.  Selling shares has less negative impact on the share price, while paying large dividends can see it rise several levels in one bound.  If this all conjures images of a kinder, simpler 18xx, it isn't really so.  However, in the games I have played, the nastiness does seem to have focused more on network building (the track upgrades are...interesting) and a devil take the hindmost train rush than on share manipulation.

The production of my Z-Man edition is mainly of the quality one would expect of a professional 18xx game, with the notable exceptions of company token stickers  printed off-centre and paper money that, while thicker than some, had to be cut out.  I liked the use of period photos on the company charters. The board has a cluttered look with copious text and player aids surrounding the map. Having said that, those player aids all proved useful.  The rules seem pretty comprehensive.

+ Weird, thematic and constrictive 18xx. Plays extremely well with 2 and 3, haven't tried it with 4, yet. A very bizarre hybrid of the 1830 and 1825 branches.
- Terrible as a teaching game. Too many rules, exceptions and chrome not usually present in its cousins.

Played with 4, there was plenty of AP so the game dragged a lot. Came out with the feeling this is a little bit more chaotic and uncontrollable than is the norm for 18XX, with huge swings in companies fortunes. 

Mostly, my conclusion is that we definitely don't know how to play this particular game all that well.

Update: Played again with 3 online, and it was a very different game. I think I finally understood some of the nuances of it, and quite enjoyed the game. Definitely worth it, but you certainly need to realize some of the twists make it rather different from the typical 18XX.

This a very original 18XX, not agressive, with the focus on good riding and trains, more then on good shares. Because no personal money is involved in bying new trains, the game rushed to its end from a certain moment on because almost every company had to lease a train.

UPDATE - [2.22.16] Finally had a chance to play a game of 1860.  This is my 5th favorite 18xx game out of the 10 that I have played.  Here are some interesting features of the game:  No "Y" track; upgradable tiles must be reachable by one of your existing trains; companies can run without a director; companies can still operate without a train; companies can go bankrupt and be reparred; companies start in "layers" of two companies each; one train per OR can run through a tokened out city; towns exist as towns or halts (halts pay 10 credits to the company treasury and do not count toward run revenue; linear stock market; company stocks can jump 1, 2, 3, or 4 spaces based on dividends paid out; the end game features the formation of the British Railway where private companies become "nationalized".  After the purchase of the first 9+5 train there is a check after each OR and SR, and the companies with the lowest dividends paid out cease to operate.  The rise and fall of companies in this game can be volatile and is fun to monitor as the game progresses.  Can't wait to try with the "Locomotives of the Isle of Wight" expansion.

[2015] Waiting for Mike Hutton's forthcoming expansion!

Is this what my trek and evolution of gaming has brought me to? If it is, then I'm content that it did... This is my first foray into an 18xx game and I'm totally hooked. Although, by consensus, not considered to be a good starting point, the powers that be had me trying this title as my introduction to the genre. It did not disappoint.

After only one play, I found the game to be intriguing and very dynamic. After a few more plays, I still find it's opacity fascinating, leading me to want to explore more of what the 18xx genre has to divulge. The game has player interaction galore; those that are accustomed to Euro Games beware. This is not multi-player solitaire; this is a perfect information game where your opponent(s) can clobber you and your actions have long term ramifications.

1860 in particular seems to place emphasis on the importance of track laying. This aspect is particularly brutal and cut-throat and can make or break a company. 

The timing of when to buy into and out of companies is also critical to success. Manipulating what the revenues of the companies end up being when nationalization hits is of decisive importance. 

I'm eager to explore what this title has to offer and if other 18xx games are similar, I'm very glad to have discovered this genre.

RATING: 5
It is short enough to play in an evening, which is good, and it IS 18xx, so it's better than a vast majority of board games. 

BUT!

The par price IPOs, a weird auction mechanic, excessively fiddly station types, and a badly written rulebook (bad even by 18xx standards) add up to a frustrating experience.

A few choice house-rules and it might hit the table a few more times when time is limited.

{edit}

Played again last night and tossed this game onto the pile. Won't be playing again. It's not that the game is bad, per se, but it is far less good than other options (some of which I am sad to say, are ordinary Euros).

One of the very few 18xx games that might be decent with 2 players. I am interested in trying out this genre of games, but I just don't currently have access to a 4-5 person gaming group.

An 18xx game that actually works for 2 players! Worth getting for that reason alone. It's definitely a little different - limited track building, and lots of the updates you expect aren't in the mix. Still suffers from long play time, but that might be my unfamilarity with the game, more plays might see playtime reduce. Not sure it works with 3, as there are 2 good starting companies, what does the 3rd player do? Shine has gone off this one a bit.  ***update, traded, so I doubt I'll play this one again

RATING: 9
Tight map busy with possibilities.  It begins with an open auction that instantly sets a tone. There is a dynamic and diverse tile manifest filled with quirky build options to create a malleable high functioning system. The threat of a brutal train rush looms and leans over the gameplay like a gargoyle on cornice. This game has everything I love in the 18xx system with several really fun twists and subtle changes. Definitely a fan of this one. Looking forward to many many more plays.

Very much looking forward to getting more plays of this in.  Have only player 2 player but I love it at that count.  The layering of the RRs makes 2 players a natural for this.  There are some irritating rules (e.g., can run one train through a tokened out city, have to start in your home city and all routes must intersect at least once), but not so bad that it takes away from the fun.  The cost of the trains also keeps the game pretty well balanced by stopping one player from buying all of the 3 trains.  I expect to get a lot of plays of this.

RATING: 4
Bearing in mind that I rate 18xx games as games, and not just as 18xx games: wow, this game is a real mess. It is in desperate need of a developer to file off the numerous rough edges and inconsistent and unnecessary rules, and generally clean and tighten a very loose game. The endgame is clever, but the rules for getting into it are a mess and it involves some stupid rules (for an 18xx game) that can arbitrarily hose you. It's also much too long for what it is. Like many 18xx games that I don't like, this is much more about managing the train rush than it is about operations, which I'm not a fan of because it doesn't justify more than a 2-hour game (1860 is 5-ish). Also, this is another of those games where you can be totally screwed right form the outset, and it can be completely obvious you're never going to win, but you are condemned to 4 more hours of futility.

Anyway, I don't play 18xx much anymore, but I am a big fan of 1825, 1853, and 1830, so I do keep my eye out for shorter, better 18xx stuff (I used to be a pretty hard-core fan). But I am always disappointed.

I found our game of 1860 utterly boring. Sure, this is partly due to the slow pace, but ultimately I fear the 18xx genre does not offer enough bang for the buck in terms of fun vs. playing time involved. I'd much prefer to play a couple of Age of Steams in the same time or play a good wargame.

Enjoyable small-scale game though it can still take a while. Works well with 2 or 3. Watch out for the flurry of rusting trains half-way through the game! 

Poorly made components (though it was a very limited hand-made edition) and no response from JKLM re. missing company stickers. Sufficiently unimpressed with their lack of communication and customer service to avoid their games in the future. My rating is for the JKLM (1st) edition.

My first 10 hour game (played over 2 days).  And it was quite enjoyable.  Surprisingly, the game kept me engaged for the entire time (as compared to a rare few where, after a couple of hours, I was hoping for some natural disaster remove all the bits from the table and make it unplayable).  There were always meaningful decisions to be made.  You needed to watch the other players and try to prepare for what they may do in the next few rounds... will they dump their stock?  Will they buy trains that may cause mine to rust, can I buy trains to cause others to rust?  What's the best tile I can upgrade to maximize my companies returns?  I'd play it again if time allowed for it.

I'm done with 18XX. I wanted to like it so much. I read discussions about games and it just sounds so perfect. But I've encountered what seems to be a classic barrier: the opportunity cost in terms of precious gaming time is way to great to get to a place where I find the game interesting. As it is, it is just overwhelming. It's not you 18XX, it's me...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Original, engrossing, wonderfully fluid and facile stock market, multiple waves of difficult to master and yet critical timings and trade-offs.  Delicious.  Plays very well with two, stronger and possibly is best with three players.  Feels like startups in Silicon Valley in the 1990s: most die and fail badly.  It really is a tough fight just to survive.

Sufficiently different to verge on not really being an 18xx.  This really is a horse of a different colour.  One of the more bizarre tile mixes I've ever seen.  There are inexplicable holes in the set that the game can easily turn on.  

As far as I've been able to tell, the core is timing the rotation of companies into and out receivership and thereby manipulating the end-game lineup when nationalisation hits.  There are very delightfully nasty things that can be done in that space.

1860 is a brilliant game, my favourite of the 18xx. Unstable, prone to great drama, screaming run-away winners, amazing hail-mary come-from-behind wins, jaw-droppingly clever coordinated move sequences, and more volatility and dynamism than you can shake a stick at -- even more than good old 1830. And for all those reasons and many more, it is a terrible game to use to learn or teach the 18xx.

RATING: 10
Update 11.21.06--Gets better each game.  Best with 3.  Plays very well with two, but absolutely requires both players to carefully monitor the situation.  It's more of a race than ever with just two, and the last thing you want is for both players to let the game stagnate (even for a turn) because they both think they're making money faster.

Great and really bloody with 4.  The average value of the priority deal card doubles, and it's much harder to run two companies that work well together.  Pre-game auction prices plummet!

Truly nasty.  Very pretty board.  Fascinating track development.  Pathological train rush.  Early companies have to buy trains for way too much money and do all the work setting up infrastructure, later companies have garbage par values and not enough time to do the withholding shuffle to get a really good train.  Hilariously bad train art.  Like, visible pixellation and compression artifacts.

The best part of one of our early games was when all three of my companies were insolvent (no train).  There are hilarious little cards you need to put on your company's charter when this happens that say INSOLVENT in big letters.  We thought we were going to run out at one point.  When you're insolvent, your earnings are basically halved and you need to save them to buy a train.  While my companies were doing this, everyone else had to buy up the worst permanent trains in the game.  Then I was able to buy great permanents one OR later for two of my companies, dump my third bad one on my neighbor to finance better stock purchases, and watch my previously insolvent keepers shoot up the stock market three and four jumps at a time.

My shrinkwrapped copy of this game arrived with no money whatsoever.  This is sort of ridiculous given that the game is about money and needs two different types of currency in 1 million denominations.

Currently this is about as good as it gets for me.

Excellent.  Wish I had a steady group for it.

Update ~5 plays later:

This is an incredible 18xx.  It is still definitely in the genre but it will work against every impulse of a long time player.  Good play is terribly obscure, but fortunately the game tends towards the dynamic and allows for comebacks of the kind rarely seen in 18xx.  I love the brutal train rush, the frustrating tile mix, and the ingenious endgame.

Only one play so far....but this one really hit it out of the park. 

I really love 18xx titles, and have played about 8 or 10 different ones. The rules changes in 1860 are subtle, but they really impact the way you make decisions here. The result is a fresh and interesting game in a smallish package. The fact that such a meaty and satisfying game can be played in a shorter time (with lower number of players) makes for a nice niche for the game.

I'm looking forward to more plays as soon as I can get it on the table. There is a lot of local enthusiasm, so I have high hopes.

RATING: 9
I really had no appreciation for how weird this game is when I first played it, but with the benefit of several other 18XX's under my belt I can say that this is one queer duck: privates that can't be bought by companies, publics that can be owned by the bank (i.e.: can sell Director's share to the stock pool), no limits on share holding in terms of % of each company, the ability to lease trains if the company can't afford one, the zig-zag stock market where companies can take multiple steps based on the size of their runs, the tiered arrangement of the publics where the maximum par price goes DOWN for the later companies (which makes it harder and harder for them to buy new trains)...all of these make the 1860 experience different and memorable. All of this, of course, makes the game a poor first 18XX game choice if you plan to play more 18XX titles in the future, because you will have to relearn so many things (i.e.: you start taking for granted rules which are not at all standard). For people with a bit more experience, the differences are a bonus though, and I like the odd-factor of this game a lot.

1860 is a game that is sort of in its own category, though it is definitely an operations-centered affair. Some people find the the extreme restrictions on what track pieces are available and when can be irksome here, but I find it a feature, albeit one I wouldn't want to see in every 18XX. The end game is also a bit funky and features a nationalization phase where the companies get additional runs using  only the large stop number on the train with the weakest two runs being eliminated and then going again and again until all of the companies have been folded in. Basically what this does is give the companies with the end-game specifically best runs (as these are obviously quite different from the normal runs due to the loss of the additional range the small stop portion of the engine gives) several additional dividends which can dramatically affect the relative player standings. The game can end before this on stock market top out, and though I've seen it close to happening, so far nationalization has occurred to end the game in each of my plays.

This game is well known for being very good with 2, but I do prefer it with 3, it definitely is better with more at the table (much more interesting stock holding patterns, incentives), and the playtime gets chopped down because players are not running as many companies and are more often ready to act when their company's turn comes up. What can pretty easily be a 7 hour 2 player game is more of a 5 hour game for 3 with our very moderately experienced 18XX group...which likely means that the 240 minutes listed in the entry would actually be accurate with 3 decently fast players who were already familiar with the rules.

I own the 1st edition which lacks the extra hexes variant board, but the 2nd edition bonus board is easily put onto it with print out hexes. I like the tightness of the smaller board though and don't really feel any desire to add the extra hexes presently, though I could see doing it if we played with 4.

I love 18xx games and have never rated them less then 6/10 (18C2C). I'll rate this one with 7, because it's better then the previously mentioned monster. But it's still one of the weakest of those I have played. The game is too complex - too many special rules - and takes too much time for 3-4 player game.

This game is brutal and full of bad choices. The most you can do is choose the least bad choice. Map is small, but the tiles are very restricting. 

- Privates don't have special abilities
- May ignore one blocked station
- 1.5D Share prices
- Running must be contiguous, and must touch the home base
- Cannot buy the last train of a company
- Different par value area
- Can hold more than 60%
- No limit at pool

This is a very brutal, competitive, unforgiving game.

Played once as two player.  Interesting game.  It's an 18xx, but owes lineage to both 1829 and 1830, which is odd.

With the number + number trains and the 'blow thru a buttoned station' rule, I feel compelled to redo my route planning as things shift...

1860 takes most every instinct you have about 18XX and turns it around, turning it into something that is definitely an 18XX games but encourages very different thoughts and actions. Unfortunately, I have made the mistake of teaching this to newer 18XX players who had not firmly gotten a grasp of the system, and they’ve translated this into fundamental misunderstandings of the other 18XX games.  I will have to be careful about that in the future. :D

Only played one game two player, and it wasn't taken that seriously so i can't comment on the competitive elements of the game.

Its fun though. Map size and the economics work well for two players. There is still a decent incentive to buy in to each others companies rather than just race each other, you can block each other on the map too.

Its more complex than 1830, but not by a vast amount. Different companies have different par values and when a company goes bust it isn't out the game yet, they can declare insolvency etc.

The components aren't as nice as the newer printings of 1830 but are value for money at the £17 i payed. The board is decent and the card for the track hexes is passable, other components are what you'd expect.

I used to live on the Island, so i find this game amusing/nostalgic

after 3 plays (rating up to a 9) - still a very good game - a very dynamic one with many paths to victory... the negative, i'm not sure poor-great play at the start translates to doing well at the end.... and while i don't think rule wise it is a difficult game - it is different enough from other 18xx games that it is hard/unfair to use it as an intro game and that at least 1 player should review the rules before playing.

Routes are a bit different in that you can pass through 1 station per run, and all runs must be 'connected'.

This causes a bit longer in determining runs due to the increased flexibility.  Station placement becomes even more important, but you also have some more flexibility as well.

Need some more plays of this one.

18XX is not really my cup of tea, but if it is yours, you should love this game.  I think it really requires a certain amount of experience to be familiar with the terrain (my plans are frequently thwarted by the nonexistence or unplayability of a needed tile) and the pacing of the game, which has a lot of change-ups.

I enjoyed my plays of this game.  It is very different from any other 18XX game I have played.  It is more a game of timing than the typical 18XX game.  I definitely want to try it again.

In this game, the strategy of building a great company and owning a lot of it can be very effective even if the rest of your portfolio is not impressive.  The ability to multi-jump up the stock market and continue running after other companies have been nationalized is very important.

1860 is a special 18xx game. At first glance it appears to be more gentle than many of its brethren: It's virtually impossible to go bankrupt as a player, you can pull out of bad companies completely, and if your company cannot afford a train the government will even get you one.

Sounds soft? Hah! The train rush can be brutal, the tile mix is weird, and companies go bankrupt or into receivership regularly. The "free" trains from the government are anything but. There are lots of timing issues, and it's difficult to get a grip on them because the game is so dynamic.

In some ways it's different enough that it doesn't even seem like an 18xx game anymore. Where else can you bankrupt your own company and still be better off afterwards?

Brass is a little boy comparing with this one in category of economic games. I'm not familiar with 18xx series but 1860 is really cool, one of my favourite strategy game without burning villages and all this stuff. It is long comparing with typical games(even economic) but it compensates it. Great game!
EDIT: and it really works perfectly with 2 players.

RATING: 8
Easily my favorite 18XX variant, based on one play. Novel mechanisms are introduced to make gameplay very interesting at the tactical and strategic level:
1) Trains are all "X+Y" types, unlike in 1835 where you have to buy "X" trains first before the "X+Y" trains become available. This means that players have a higher incentive to connect to small towns.
2) Small towns may start as "holds", where trains are not required to stop (they don't count against your train speed if you don't want to), but pay $10 into the company treasury if you do.
3) A player can get rid of all stocks in one company, and no one is required to retain directorship.
4) Share-price will decrease on a one-by-one basis.
5) A director-less company will continue to operate and withhold.
6) A company that has no trains can become insolvent, yet continue to operate "leasing" the highest speed train, and withhold. Thus, players could trash a company, only to go buy it again when the company has enough cash. (There is no way to re-capitalize a company, except through "holds"; companies "float" and are fully capitalized when 50% of the shares are bought.
7) Somewhat staggered start of companies, similar to 1835, but much more straightforward.
8) Interesting track tile variations, for interesting tactical play.
9) Strangely, the later companies have successively lower ranges of par values. However, share prices can jump two to four spaces (instead of one) in the market, depending on the amount of income generated for that operating round. In this manner, seemingly cheap stock can appreciate quickly and potentially catch up with the older, more established companies.
10) There are a series of bidding rounds, where the winner of a particular auction wins the "right" to purchase one of the initial companies.

The map is smaller, and the play is tighter, yet it doesn't feel cramped due to the variety of track tiles available (however, there are no switches). I've only played 2-player, but this was great fun as both a sparring-match, and as a learning game to develop and pick up new strategies for over 18XX games. 3-player may be the sweet spot, with 4-player being too cramped.
 
The Z-Man 2nd edition build quality is good, although the die-cutting of the track tiles seemed poor. The wooden discs for the station markers, income track markers, and share price markers were a nice touch. The rules were well written, and there were no ambiguities. Having some intricate rules printed on the map and the stock certificates themselves was an excellent design choice.

All in all, this seems to be a gentler, quieter 18XX. Mistakes are not magnified like some other 18XX designs, and somewhat easily corrected or compensated for. A dire situation could be turned around in an instant, depending on situation, making for tense, meaty play. However, there are a number of nooks and crannies that make this version a delight to play--it will take a number of plays to "discover" all the nuances of this design, as it is sophisticated, yet subtle in its intricacies. Due to those intricacies, this took longer, clocking at six hours before the two of us called the game. Learning the game took an hour, given that both of us had previous 18XX experience. As others have noted, this is probably not a good intro to 18XX. I would highly recommend playing this with only two players for the first several times to get the mechanisms down, before trying a three-player.

I think if there are only two players and 6-hours, this is a great 2-player 18XX game. With three, this may still be the best choice for an 18XX game. I am excited enough to consider locating a copy soon. It is initially an '8', but edging very close to a '9' and then some.

Update (01/04/12) 2 plays: 3-player took approximately 6.5 hours. The phases seem to go by faster, and the unexpected "train rush" may be surprising, throwing curve-balls for the uninitiated and unprepared. 3-player definitely has the right balance of tenseness and fluidity of play. 2-player seems too open, while 4-player may be too cramped for this board. Overall, a pleasure to play, especially that we finally played to the end, where the nationalization almost kicked in, and that we had the opportunity to play through a few companies going insolvent and one going bankrupt. There's plenty going on near the end, but well worth it.

Mike Hutton's first design is really an 1825 variant with an endgame nationalisation sequence added, but there's a large number of really fiddly rules added that make no thematic or gameplay sense to me. Why can't a new company upgrade a tile on its first OR? I've lost count of the number of times that I've forgotten that rule and I just can't think of a justification for the rule being there. This is also one of those 18xx's where the initial auction is huge and there are no clear answers as to what's best to do. It's possible to be largely screwed from a very early stage and that's never acceptable in the long game that 18xx simply has to be. The end game nationalisation sequence is clever and it's here that the game is mostly won and lost, but once again the rules for getting there are really convoluted. In spite of the small geographic area, this game just doesn't have a selling point. It takes as long to play as 1830 while having more rules.

There's nothing about an 18xx game that provides me any form of enjoyment, and so the prospect of spending another three hours(at minimum) per session at least half a dozen more times just to progress past the conscious incompetence stage is unappealing.

RATING: 7
Solid 18xx game, but little "wow!" factor. The board is small and the potential for track-building is very limited. The stock market is very static and not very interesting. Despite this, the game is long and goes on and on and on for OR after OR with little change to the game's state. The train rush is particularly unforgiving (many non-permanent trains, all of which are extremely expensive). Fun endgame mechanism where companies not performing well are closed down.

So, while the game has some fun and unique mechanisms, it's just too long and repetitive for its own good.

1860 is a very unique twist on the 18xx system. The main change is planning for the train rush via bankrupting your own companies as it's not possible to finance train purchases from your own pocket. But there are lots of other distinctive features which combine into one of the best 18xx on the market although die-hard fans of the system might have a problem with the different approach needed. Components are weak but acceptable and I'm glad that I got my preorder even though the publisher JKLM went bankrupt in between preordering and delivery.

A great variation on the 18xx theme.  With a very different track manifest, different rules for capitalization, track laying, route calculation, company management (receivership and bankruptcy), this game does not feel like a lot of the more generic 18xx titles (not a bad thing, even a relatively generic 18xx is usually good) and looks like it will provide challenges for a long time to come.

Played a 3p all 18xx newb game. An exhilarating, overwhelming, exhausting beast. I want more (two more games already scheduled this month).

Update: Played a 2p and 4p game, the 4p game was the most satisfying of all.  The game is becoming less overwhelming from an administrative standpoint. With 4, we witnessed negotiaion and nearly saw an inter-president train deal (the story of "nearly" is complicated, the deal was agreed to in principal during the stock round, so a third party attempted a takeover via stock, but the would be train recipient had more cash so he took over the company via stock rather than wait to buy the train during operations). 

The new guy in the 4p game rated it as one of his favorite gaming sessions, so I think the game is here to stay in our group!

Fascinating track laying. The stock market has duller teeth than the typical 1830-line xx, but it's got more of them? What I mean to say is that it's a complex and multifaceted stock market.

Feels like there's loads of little subtleties I just haven't yet learnt to capitalize on. The map freeze at the end is convenient, saves time from the final calculations. Companies that don't seem to do so good can be winning bets at the end, so there's a lot of play around that. Never too many xx:s that work with less players.
Even though it feels like it's too much about just building the final big runner, and not quite enough stock action to my tastes, it's great. I'm annoyed by not being skilled enough at it, which just makes me want to play more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
A super-tight board and extremely bizarre tile selection (tight curves in all four corners of the hex, curves crossing like spaghetti, etc.)  However, this puts a bit too much focus on track-building for my tastes, as track-building is not what I find interesting about 18xx.  I see track as just something to create imbalances in the company values that lead to the financial shenanigans.  I don't find it an interesting result to  find that a company is locked in to a corner of the board just because the director didn't realize that a certain basic green tile cannot upgrade to russet.

Some improvements here add some drama to the end game, such as multiple jumps on the stock chart for high payouts and a final operating round in which the weakest companies disappear one by one.  Also, possibility for 100% company ownership and 100% of stocks salable to the bank pool add a new dynamic.

However it is not clear to me why the designer decided to handcuff the players in seemingly arbitrary ways.  Why force the companies to operate in a certain tiered order?  Why separate company cash and player cash, thus preventing forced train buys?

In the end, this is about an equal mix of improvements I like in the 18xx and things I don't like.  A half-dividend, if you will.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A lot of interesting changes make this feel very unique to the 18xx family. Being able to control all of a company that is paying huge dividends can make up for an otherwise poor portfolio while the multiple stock jumps can allow for new strategies, otherwise absent from other 18xx titles.

RATING: 9
A great improvement on the 1825 series.
I like the auction for privates. I enjoy the added chrome and the fact that it's not easy to manipulate the trains with multiple companies.
I also enjoy the limited trains in each category.making trains rush have a different meaning.
But best of all is the way the linear stock market is implemented.

I feel this game takes the [i]1825[/i] series by Francis Tresham to its logical conclusion.  In fact, I would like to try adapting the rules of [i]1860[/i] to [i]1825[/i] -  the rules on "Nationalization" in particular.  My one big dislike of [i]1860[/i] is the amount of calculations that are required in the later stages of the game with trains capable of 7+ stops although the game does alleviate it a bit with the income track round the board edge to mark it from one turn to the next.  All in all, this is currently my favourite 18xx game.

Really nice 18xx and like playing it with two.

Basically no relevant stock market actions, at least the way we play it. Very much like the rules for running trains: The first one must intersect your main station. All runs together must give a single connected network. Runs connect at halts but must go from station to station. Also like the government subsidy for stopping at halts (and that you can skip them too).

Slight annoyance: Since having this for Train Simulator I know how small the island is and the whole prospect of plastering it with 8 companies seems absurd.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.1
All of your instincts about 18xx will be wrong here.  You can't sell in privates.  The track upgrades are unfriendly. You get to run through one blocked station with 1 of your trains.  You can throw away companies -- if you toss them with a cheap train you won't even lose money, probably.  

Awesome game.  3 is probably the best player count; even 2 works.  4 is OK.

Very small/tight map.  Track laying and token placement is critical in this game.  Reasonable playtime.  Some complain of this game being TOO different from other 18xxs, and being hard to learn/play as a result.  I don't see it that way, but then this is only the 3rd 18xx I've played and so am not so entrenched in the classical system.  

I have to knock it a little though as counting the long train runs is a pain in the ass.  It is a pain in all 18xxs, but this game has unusually long trains so its even worse (6+3, 7+4, 8+4, 9+5).  Still, great game.

This is a very odd game for sure.  People talk about the 1830 and 1829 branches of the 18XX tree.  Well 1860 is its own branch.  

I love the way you can withhold in a company right to the brink of bankruptcy, give it a big train, and see it zoom up the stock chart.  See it bounce!  If I played this enough to properly leverage this mechanism, and win, I'd feel pretty good.

On the other hand this game has so many frustrating little rules that it feels rough.  I am hoping Mike Hutton comes out with a smoother game in the future.

RATING: 6
Rules read and ready to play. Almost identical to 1830 in terms of rules which is awesome.

Edit: After first play adding a few rules to the game of 1830 actually made it quite a bit more complicated than I had anticipated. I'm going to have to re-read the rules again, but it felt similar but on a much smaller scale and a lot more chrome thrown in. I liked it, but keeping track of company credits and bank credits got annoying. Either I need 2 sets of poker chips or I need to figure out a way to keep things separate.

[b]Update[/b]: Finally got to sit down and play a full game of this. We screwed up a few things, but generally got 95% of the game right. I actually really liked it. The rules for running trains is a bit weird, but it works well enough. The train rush was brutal, but being able to completely dump a company was fun. It plays quite differently than most 18xx games that I've played, but I rather enjoyed it. Definitely not a beginners game, but it's at least playable if your opponents have patience.

This game plays best with 3, but it was surprisingly fun with 2. Knowing that you can own 100% of a company really changes things up.

[b]Update 2:[/b] This game has a lot of funky rules to it. I'm not sure how much I like where you can't buy a companies last train. There are a few other things about it, but I think it needs 1 more play to figure out what I like/dislike about it.

[b]Update 3:[/b] While I still haven't played it again in a couple years so this is sort of an update, I do realize my tastes have changed a bit and I've progressed much further into my 18xx gaming, I might enjoy this a bit more. I do remember it having a bizarre train running op phase, so that may still drive me nuts as well as the not being bale to sell your last train. I'd like to give this another go sooner rather than later to see what I now think of it.

I like 18xx's, and 1860 is an above average one. Like in 1825, the opportunities for ugly tricks on the stock market is much lower than in 1830, and the result is that there is much more cross-investment, and (at least in the game that I played) more movement of shares between players. But there still is a lot of strategy in this game; much of it centered around insolvent companies. We saw a lot of insolvencies, probably because of a severe train rush.

My 18xx group is very slow, so I liked the rule that at some point, no further track laying is possible, and company revenues are almost fixed. This shortens the end game considerably, which means that the game stays interesting until the very end (which is sometimes a problem for 18xx games).

One of the weaker 18xx for me. Stock market is quite linear and Gameplay is not as dynamic as I would like either (some weird limitations). But if it was the only 18xx game out there I would play it gladly again.

Awesome, complex and a very good two player 18XX... One of my favorites even if I miss the possibility of dumping a company...

RATING: 7.5
Interesting variation on the 1830 benchmark:

Simplified private company auction - players bid, winner pays the big then buys their choice of available certificate at face value.

Simplified stock market.

All shares can be sold, thus impossible to dump a poor company on another player.  (Companies may be director-less and run automatically until they recover or go bankrupt.)

Uses the X+y train system from 1870 etc (main stations for cash, halts for subsidiary company income).
One private company cannot be bought until phase 6 and can survive to the game end (and seems a very lucrative option - I feel it needs to be auctioned instead of bought for face value).

Strange rule that re-writes running trains to not be able to re-enter a hex once they have left it.  Optional rule is included it run trains the 'normal' 1830 way.

Three end-game triggering options: Run the bank dry.  One company reaches the top of the stock market.  First 9-train purchased triggers the first stage of end-game, and the second trigger is then checked for every OR and SR.  Player companies are then nationalised starting with the least lucrative until all are done.


I have a concern that the game could become a bit formulaic with multiple plays as there look to be a few starting track positions that one would have to lay to be competitive.

This is an excellent game that is at least just as good as a 3-player game as it is as a 2-player game.
Now played twice as a 2-player and twice as a 3-player game.  The last time included the 3 extra hexes of the second edition game.

This is a really refreshing entry into the 18xx world, turning lots of stuff on its ear. You can sell a President's share, you can run through a blocked city, you can run a company without a train (leasing one until you can afford one), you can own 100% of a company, companies become available to be floated in pairs, the par values for companies start high and get lower so you can't easily use later companies to shuffle operating capital to other companies the way you can in 1830, and so on. Very cool hybrid stock chart as well, where you can do multiple jumps, meaning you can run companies that are *just* unattractive enough for other people to buy into, then a well-timed train shuffle can cause you to shoot up the stock chart and turn your 100% ownership into a boatload of value. 

I do fear that this is primarily known as "The two-player 18xx," which is technically true, as it is one of the (very) few 18xx titles that plays (and plays well) with just two players. I would love to play it 3p or even 4p at least once, just to experience it. Since only two companies are available right away, it forces at least one investor strategy, which I always like to see in action.

RATING: 8.5
The upside:
-If this was an 18xx it would be my favorite, but when you change so much from the core rules, I just think it would not be fair comparing it with others.
-Best with 2/3 players, which is rare for this kind of beast.
-It really surprised me how much detail, nitpick or tiny rule they put into this game and every single one of them seems to work.
-I dont remember much boardgames that could be described with this word: Cinematic.

The downside:
-Changes almost everything you know about 18xx rules.

I wish I could have played this game, but with all the rule's tweaks compared to other 18xx titles, I decided that I could exist without this game. Besides, my intention was to use the shorter game time in this game to hook new players... 
EDIT - I acquired this game again. Hopefully I get it played :)

I'm not formally rating the game due to conflict of interest, but I enjoyed it very much. 1860 was my first 18xx game and probably a good one through which German-gamers can sample them, given the smaller size of the map, and greater emphasis on the other elements. I liked the 'nationalisation' endgame, and the general flow of play-- the varied number of share/operating rounds is a nice touch. While I don't think economics games are ever going to be my favourite type of game, personally, 1860 was good fun and I shall play again.

--Apr2011-- This one's pretty much out of my league for the moment:  I was annihilated on the first play.  Still, it's the sort of thing I'd consider myself privileged to get back to the table.  I managed to notice an interesting interplay of a variety of timing manoeuvres - but, unfortunately, am not yet competent to manipulate them reasonably myself.

This has joined Steam over Holland as one of my two favorite 18xx games.  True, it is fairly different from many of the games out there and is therefore hardly representative.  Even though, there are some interesting things going on.  I like the building rules.  I particularly like some of the similarities to 1825 as well.  I have really happy this one came back into print.  [03/13/2011]

RATING: 10
This is really an elegant take on the 18XX system.  The game feels much lighter than I expected, perhaps because of the forgiving nature of not having a train for your company or for the fact that there isn't a whole lot of money laundering or enroning like there is in 1856.  I would highly recommend this as an intro into the 18xx world.  My only gripe is the end game.  There is the significant potential for the last couple turns to be rote as one player tries to get a 9 train going for the last company. Even this is fine, my real problem with the end game is that there are final runs based on your network, eliminating two companies from the bottom up then running again.  If there is a tie then three companies are eliminated, this means that the second place player doesn't get to run as many times because of people tying below him.  This seems like crap to me.  Ties should be broken somehow. Otherwise a perfect game.

Another 18xx game specially designed for 3/4 players. It was my first time I actually ended a 18xx game. Usually we take part of the money off to take some time of play. I liked the game as I usually like 18xx games. It's not new enough to think of it as a "new game" but it can be in a better range than others who are even more time consuming. As I usually say time is not very important when you play a game you like but my problem with 1860 and with all 18xx games I've tried so far is that I don't feel the interest above 3 hours of play. Players do the same over and over because there's not much going on except if you consider the tango between companies interesting enough to retain your brains for the whole 5/6 hours of play. I don't. I prefer to play a game that has different aspects of play specially if I'm going to play it for 6 hours. Well 1860 plays in 4 hours maybe. I admit that for the first time we may have taken too long and looked at the rules too often too. 
On the positive side I have to say the time of play and the strong interaction feeling. 
On the negative side the exceptions on the rules are very annoying.

UPDATE
I like the very tight map. It's very difficult to get your perfect tile in 1860.
The train rust is vital and really nasty! That's a good thing!
I don't like the market very much. Players can sell every share to the bank and I rather like a more cruel system like 18AL (even though it may seem a simpler game).
The ending nationalization is not something I like. In fact I consider it a chaotic mechanism specially when other previous insolvent companies can end better than some of the others just because they got a lowned train for a few turns and happened to end the game with more network profits. I would play without this rule for sure in my next game and simply end up with the bank funds.
Also, if the couple last companies take too long to float it may happen that the capitalization isn't enough for a train making them not to open. It's something new but, nevertheless, not so funny IMO.

Interesting and playable take on the 18xx system. Like other 18xx games the game revolves around obtaining shares in railway companies and running the trains associated with them. The primary emphasis is on the economic aspect of such an endeavour and the shrewd management of capital is paramount to achieving success, and the game is quite unforgiving in this sense because if you fall behind due to mistakes at any point, particularly early on in the game, it's highly unlikely that you will be able to catch up. The map is much smaller than other games in the series and this leads to far more interaction between companies as prime locations are fought over and routes are interlinked. I like the concept of the nationalisation part of the game whereby smaller companies are swallowed up, but in practice this just prolongs the scoring and doesn't really bring anything necessary to the game. Having said that, this is overall an excellent railway/economic game and a worthwhile addition to the 18xx series.

First impressions after one play. Wow.  What an awesome game.  My comments are all going to be pretty generic because I've only played one 18xx, but I had a GREAT time.  I'm not really sure how to play well, but it was a lot of fun to run the trains and train companies.  I'm probably more interested in train running than stock market manipulation, but this game has plenty of of train company action.  Rating has lots of room to move up or down, (probably up)with further plays.  2006/11/11

Love the track development and how it ties into setting up for the all important end game. Love the dynamism of companies being able to shoot up the stock market in short order, and the freedom of players never being on the hook for companies that can't afford a train. Insolvency is the blessing in disguise that I've yet to feel like I've manipulated to its full potential. A compelling xx for those who enjoy the spatial element and picking the right investments. This was my first 18xx and remains a favorite.

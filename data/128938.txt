One of those games you just want to play again immediately you finish to try a different team or a different approach. With eight or so super-hero teams to try out against each other, not to mention weapons, drafting, and mercenaries, there is a lot of replayability here for a small cheap card game. It's too early to know where the tactical interest keeps up, of course, but after one play I could tell I had been outfoxed by superior play and had lots of ideas for other things I wanted to try. Within the constraints of a small, light card game there is really lots to think about and even a drawn-out first play was done in half an hour. I'd think fifteen minutes a game when you know the rules would be reasonable. Very glad I kickstarted this.

Kickstarted the game based on the theme and I'm happy to report that I do like the game too.

Design is excellent, game is relatively simple and fast to play and drafting (which I generally don't like) if not in huge role in the game. There's also more than enough variety in the game which makes this a solid game to carry around.

Good game.

Surprisingly rules-light for a game where every card is different. And there are interesting tactical decisions.

On the other hand, standing toe to toe and slowly chipping away life points is not a very exciting framework for the interesting asymmetries to sit on top of (a flaw this shares with Sentinels Of The Multiverse -- why? why make superhero combat into trench warfare?).

Before playing this I really thought it would be up my street, as I'm a fan of 2 player games and especially card-based ones.  However, I found this game to be rather dull and lifeless and if it wasn't for the vibrant theme then I think it would be a rather bad game indeed.

The main problem for me is that the board stagnates very quickly, after a couple of turns the board is full and you are simply drawing cards one at a time and hopefully activating a skill on one of your heroes.  The skills are also not very powerful and you will be simply doing the same "1 damage" or "stun this guy" routine turn after turn until there's a gap in the board again for you to fill immediately with another hero.  What makes this worse is that there's not enough hidden information and no way to power up your heroes so you can actually see what the minimum number of turns required for a player to win the game is - this doesn't make for a very exciting game.

On the plus side, the game's short and easy to learn and I feel it would be fun to play with kids, but I think there are much better two player card games out there.

This is a neat little card game. It's a little like Summoner Wars, where each card represents a unit on a grid, and each faction plays a little differently. It plays pretty quickly, and gets even fast as the game progresses (and some of the decisions become a little more obvious). I wouldn't buy it because my wife would have no interest, but I would definitely play it again.

* Kickstarted! *

A decent two-player card game using superheroes as a theme. Each hero has different abilities and the combinations are fun, as are the limited power quantities. But be warned: some teams are imbalanced, and the booklet fails to mention that coloured sleeves are ESSENTIAL to the game because the hero cards are double-sided.

PLUS: variety of play, theme
BIG PLUS: play mat in the Kickstarter version lays out everything
BIG MINUS: imbalance, needs sleeves without telling you on the box

This game surprised me.  It's quite good for a 2 play only card battling game.   Well designed.  It's a shame there won't be anymore expansions or follow up sets.  

However, the set we are given feels like a game with expansions.  It comes with 8 sets of heroes for a total of 40, Most games like this would only come with 4 or 6 sets.  And it comes with optional, 1-time use weapons.  This set of cards is for variant play, and works just like a later add-on or expansion that I have seen in other games.

A semi-neat game by Phil-Walker Harding. It's a bit slow, would love to draw 2 power cards each round or something to speed it up.

Clever little card game. I like the idea of having heroes face off against each other from different factions, but each faction has its own leader, its own support characters, etc. The game does have its issues. The end game drags out a bit, certain factions rely more heavily on some colors of cards than others, and you can have turns where you can't really do a whole lot, though movement is still free, and very important to be mindful of. Some more differentiation between factions would go a long way towards making this game better as well, but overall, I find it very enjoyable for a filler game.

Fun tiny tactical combat game. I really like the back stories and strange combinations of the superheros. The fact that it comes in a small package with a very simple, yet effective rule set is awesome. There's also a lot of variability and options as you learn how the different factions work and how they play out against the other factions.  The board can sometimes stagnate towards the end of the game. It also feels like not all the factions are equally balanced against one another, but that might be my own inability to use certain abilities effectively.

I played this for the first time, in this case with my 9 year old son. We had a blast. It plays like Pokemon CCG but I think in a simpler, easier way. With the number of teams available plus the optional weapons, there is a lot of replay value. I am very pleased I backed this game on Kickstarter!

RATING: 5
The hereos are sort of balanced.  Gameplay is sort of interesting.  The theme is sort of humorous.  The game functions fine, but there's nothing fun about it.

For my taste, there are not enough synergies between heroes, so drafting and tactical maneuvers are usually pretty straight forward.  Take the best cards; play the best cards; hope you draw the right cards.

The real thing going for the game is the theme, which I found fell flat -- the heroes are neither serious enough to be emotionally engaging nor absurd enough to be truly hilarious.  They are mostly just obvious parodies or obvious puns.

RATING: 6
01-05-2014. Rated after first play. Quick, summoner wars-ish 2 player combat card game. The game is played on a 3x3 grid, which makes combat/interaction almost immediate to occur. The aim of the game is to either be the first to kill your opponents 5 heroes, or occupy the 3 locations closest to your opponent. 

You start the game with one hero in play and 4 in the reserve. Turns proceed back and forth. Turns are really quick and easy. You may move 1 of your heroes and take 1 action (play a hero from your reserve or use on of the special abilities listed on your in-play heroes) and draw a new energy card. Some heroes have continuous actions, which you may activate without counting towards your 1 action per turn limit.

The fun twist in this game -to me- is the use of the energy cards to pay for these actions. You have 3 energy-types (red, blue, green) and the printed actions on your heroes often require a specific energy card, while some heroes are more flexible. This mechanism adds some more depth to the game and limits your choices.

All in all, after playing my first game I was really impressed. I currently have rated the game a 7, but I wanted to play the game immediately again. Which I think might indicate that the game might go up in rating during subsequent plays.

--Oct2015-- It's quite cute.  A little tactical skirmish game, where each hero has a set of Special Powers.  Ordinarily, that might bog down: but any given game is only five heroes per player; so the total number of things that one wants to keep track of is quite tractable.  It's a fine example of something that's not quite my style.  But - fortunately for me - son #2 was amused by it.

An honest game, this is. Little in the eye but there is so much tactics in a small filler. Little luck involved, that rarely can decide the outcome.
Teams number is sufficient and provides much replayability. Using the draft option gives it even more lifetime, though it is recommended for experienced players. The art is a matter of taste, personally I think it was a good choise for the theme.
What seems to be a little wierd is that you suppose to have superheroes, but most of their attacks are not impressive. Having to spend 2 cards for your monster to deal 1 dmg, reduces the feeling of the game.

There's a chapter in [i]Soon I Will Be Invincible[/i] where the villain protagonist, Dr. Impossible, complains that no matter how clever you are, no matter how devious your schemes, clashing with superheroes always comes down to just punching each other in the face. That, in a nutshell, is Pack of Heroes.

Two opposing groups of five heroes, represented by cards, battle it out on a 3x3 grid. Each turn, a player can move one hero, then either use any hero's power or place a new one. It is essentially a lighter/simpler version of Summoner Wars or Pixel Tactics.

The presentation, at least, is brilliant. Each hero is an absurd, terrible character, worse than the worst of the silver age (Hypno Hustler, eat your heart out!) -- we're talking unicorn men, sentient chewing gum, men with ice-cream for hands and so on. The artwork and flavour text are both amusing. The game even comes with a mini comic.

Gameplay wise, I love micro-spatial games like RRR and Let's Catch the Lion! so this seemed right up my alley. It does work reasonably well; the trouble is that, unlike those games, or even like Summoner Wars, heroes generally do so little damage (usually 1-2) relative to their opponents' health (4-7), and take actions at such a glacial pace (one per turn), that the game works out to be a slow grind. While some do have interesting movement powers or other effects, with very few exceptions it is not a game of sweet combos or synergies; it is a game about repeatedly punching each other in the face and moving heroes around to most effectively punch / avoid being punched.

The idea, I suppose, is that it's a melee in slow motion. But the result is at best dry (maneouvre until eventual win by tedious attrition of damage cubes) and at worst dead boring. Additionally, while there is an element of hand-management in the use of power cards, luck of the draw can play a key role; compounding the problem is that power costs correlate poorly to effectiveness, so e.g. Liberty Steel's incredibly effective blast attack costs 1 red, while Hot Foot's is half as good for three times the price. In cases like this, some power cards really are better than others, and it makes a huge difference if you draw the right one immediately or if it takes you five turns.

Not bad, but a bit disappointing.

About [thing=128938][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=128938][/thing] is a two player card game in which players control a group of five heroes battling for control of the city.

It has pretty strightforward rules, and a play can be done in about 15 to 20 minutes - maybe 5 minutes more if using drafting to form the team of heroes. Of course this can't happen if the game is loaded with hard decisions, and [thing=128938][/thing] isn't: the options are very limited, which makes the pacing and resolution of actions quite fast.

Replay value is high: the game comes with 8 teams of 5 heroes, which can be played in this way (as a team), or mixed, in the draft format, increasing the possibilities; alongside with the option of using weapons (which can also be mixed in the draft, or drawn, randomly), and the very mechanic of the game, since the availability of power cards can have deep impact in the decisions made and in the overall play.

The graphic design and the art, both made to resemble the vintage look of comics, is great: it made me want to purchase the game right away, even when knowing little about it. From the look of the cards, the way the manual is made as a comic book, to the guide of heroes as a confidential document and with the addition of an actual (small) comic book, [thing=128938][/thing] is a complete winner in the art and graphic design.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
The first player is decided. To play, the simplest way is: each player draws a team of heroes and plays with it. It is possible to mix 3 teams of heroes and to draft your own unique team, following the guideline: one leader, two sidekicks and two fighters. Finally is possible to add weapons, which are normally one-time powers, and these can also be randomly drawn or added to the draft.

Once the teams are set, the first player draws 1 power card, and the other person, 2 cards. The battle starts. Both players, at the same time, pick of hero to add to the board (which is a 3x3 grid, formed by the draw pile of power cards, the discard pile of power cards and the player aid), revealing who was chosen simultaneously. Neither hero activates their arrival power (if any). 

The turn of a player is:
a) Move 1 hero. Heroes can either run or fly. Fly allows a hero to pass over other heroes; run, don't. The movement, regardless of type, must end in an empty space;
b) Action: Either use the power of a hero already in play, or put a hero in play. To use a power, the player must discard one or more power cards, of the kind demanded by the power being used. Power usually do damage, but some can heal, stun, defend and/or are constant. To add a hero, the player picks one and puts it in one the the three spaces closest to the base of its owner - at least one of these spaces must be open in order for the player to be able to add a hero to the board, otherwise she won't be able to use this option;
c) Unstun. Some powers can stun a hero. A stunned hero can't move or use power. In this phase, your stunned heroes recover;
d) Draw. The player may draw 1 power card. There is a limit of 3 power cards in hand. The player can, however, have 3 cards and decided to draw another - then she must choose one to discard.

When a hero receives damage, it is marked on the card with cubes, which remain there until the hero is defeated or healed. Every hero has an amount of health. Turns went by until all the heroes of one side are defeated. The battle can also end if one side doesn't have a hero on the board and isn't able to add a new hero because all three closest spaces to her are occupied by the other side heroes - it is considered that the base was captured and the other side wins.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
There are three main ones in the basic game:
- Where to move. Can be important, as some heroes need to move, pass by others or are simply slow, and might have a hard time reaching their opponents while being attacked. Yet, as the board is so small, most heroes can reach a place to attack in a single turn. Still, a good positioning can give a little edge when using some attacks or to be able to protect a hero;
- What power to use. This is the most common decision. But isn't a hard one, since this decision are often limited by the type of power cards you have - you might want to attack Lady Steele, but isn't able, so you must go with Dr. Feelgood instead;
- When to add a hero to the fight and which one. While this is a decision you won't do more than 5 times in the game, it is the most important one. Mainly because it allows you to use powers, and the considerations about movement, type of power, what power cards it needs to be used, health value, etc, are key in order to make the best use of your team, otherwise you might find yourself without options in several turns, and likely heading to a defeat.

If using drafting, you will have a new set of decisions, as assembling a team will have a major weight in your battle later on, due to the possibilities with combos and synergies around the heroes, as well as limitations. I definitely recommend using drafting instead of simply drawing teams.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Superb art and graphic design;
- Fast gameplay and resolution of powers;
- Offers some spatial possibilities in the 3x3 grid of battle;
- Easy to teach and to play - but it has a small learning curve inside the different teams of heroes;
- Portable - it comes in a tiny box;
- Good amount of decisions with the drafting variant;
- High replay value.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Many decisions are on the evident side, once the hero is in place;
- Gameplay can be bland, specially towards the end;
- Two players only;
- The box won't hold the cards once sleeved.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like being the Itchy and Scratchy Show, as [thing=128938][/thing] is to 2 players battling teams as Itchy and Scratchy is to the Simpsons: a very unique, small, self contained and quickly resolved universe inside a much bigger one - in this comparison, the Simpsons could be [thing=58281][/thing], or [thing=101721][/thing], or [thing=124742][/thing], and I can definitely imagine Pack of Heroes passing in a TV in New Angeles.

While I enjoyed [thing=128938][/thing], specially due to its small frame, it has issues: sinergies are hard to get, gameplay loses steam near the end, with most of the heroes already defeated, there isn't a true "superpower" feel to the actions being done, and more times than it is good for it, the decisons are too obvious, with little room for major twists and comebacks; and, near the end, it can already be decided way before the final blow - however, as a 2 player, one side can easily concede to the other.

Still, overall, [thing=128938][/thing] "packs" a lot of punch inside a tiny box: excellent and strongly thematic art, setting the whole mood of the game; high replay value; several options, while keeping itself light and easy to play and teach; with everything put in a playing time of 15-20 minutes. I bought it for the art and graphics, but stayed for the mechanics that don't try to overreach, keeping the game fast and neat.

I'm not fond of either comics nor two player only games, but I am super fond of Phil Walker-Harding, and the retro art style as well as the theme of 'too many heroes' and humour in the game all come together to form something great.

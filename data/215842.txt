You must solve a series of riddles and puzzles to escape from a room. Each correct solution brings you to another riddle. How fast can you escape the room? This game can be played only once, because you markup, fold, and tear the game materials.

Almost certain we mistakenly missed a card here, or something along those lines as we just had a dreaful time playing this one. I've rated the four other Exit games I've played up until now 8-9/10 and my friends and I have always managed to do well with solving the puzzles with limited/no clues. But this one, we just packed up unfinished. Had an awful time with a few puzzles - still didn't get it after checking the solutions and consulting BGG, so just gave up. Have rated this one a 4, rather than a 1, as I can only assume we did something to mess the experience up for ourselves - as the other games in this series have been very good indeed. By far the worst of the series I've played so far, though.

Also, since this game is a "one and done" game, this review is more subjective of the overall experience comparatively to other games in the series and in this genre.

Should have photocopied the booklet before playing. Definitely had to cut up and fold things. Took three of us almost 2 full hours to finish but held our attention for most of it. I like how the clues lead you to new clues. None of the puzzles were too hard except for the very last one. We needed all three hint cards to solve it.

This one came with hard puzzles and some of the cool twists that make the Exit series so innovative and fun. But also really crunchy stuff. My head hurts. We needed more hints than ever. Therefore, not my favorite of the series.

[url=http://fortressat.com/articles-analysis/2767-idiots]Cooperative games are not games, they are puzzles. And whether I win or lose against a random inanimate/unintelligent algorithm, I am left feeling unsatisfied. I'd rather play a One versus All or a Team versus Team game. [/url]

This one was great for us. We did it as a couple and worked without the clock over a couple of evenings and it was a blast. We didn't use a single clue and found the puzzles to be just the right difficulty. We much prefer this series to the Unlock one.

2 of the puzzles were so hard and unintuitive that we spend 50+ minutes trying to solve them before we used the solution cards. Then even after reading the solution found them unnecessarily complicated and thus frustrating. The rest of the puzzles was good.

Exit: The Game – The Polar Station is an escape room-style game that's only meant to be played once. The game comes with a booklet full of locations and other oddities, a bunch of object cards, some miscelleneous items that are punched out of a sheet, and an assortment of clue cards. Like the other Exit games, this one cannot be passed onto other players once complete, as the game asks you to fold or cut up some of the booklet pages and cards. That said, we actually did play this set twice with two different groups, but needed to photocopy the entire booklet to do so. The game presents a number of puzzles that need to be solved in a very particular order, as you get some but not all of the necessary clues for all but the next puzzle as the game proceeds. I found the puzzles in this game to be fairly straightforward, especially once you've understood how the Exit series works. The puzzles here are more diverse than in the Unlock series, but as a boardgamer I think I might enjoy the constraints of the Unlock rules set a little more. In any case, this one was quite enjoyable.

From 3 games I played from Exit series somehow this seemed most difficult. We took like 4 meetups, all about 2h long, to just sit and try crack quizzes. Few of codes we just somehow guessed.

We managed do by not damaging any game elements, it is possible using separate paper.

A fun puzzle cooperative activity, but I'm not sure I'd call it a game.  However, it was a fun way to spend a couple of hours.  Some of the puzzles were very frustrating and we did need to use the solutions, even though in one case we were doing all the right things, just not coming up with the right answer!  Others were more straightforward, just following the instructions.  Overall fun enough that I'd happily try another in the series.  And use of a photocopier means that we can even pass our copy on to someone else for them to play!

This was quite exhausting, taking us 4+ hours and even 2 hints. But it was just a 2 payer experience and the other player not yet used to the system. We needed a complete hour, after which we took the hint cards just for the second puzzle. First we did not get a rather obvious clue regarding which page of the journal to use for this puzzle. (It just occurred to me on the next day.) Second because we found something early, and assumed it has to be related to the puzzle, but it became important much later in the game. Two other puzzles we have sunken a lot of time into, but finally got them without using hints. All in all a satisfying experience, but I feel a bit bad for the in retrospective unnecessarily used hint cards.

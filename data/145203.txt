Nice engine-building game with some planning.  Pretty wooden, as you'd expect.  It requires a little memory to play, though, and it becomes a little uninteresting during the last several turns.  I'd rate it higher if it didn't play so long.

During these years in gaming I have been searching for a good city builing game for a long time... finally I found the right one for me! I really enjoy Prosperity and I really believe, that this game feels like managing a city (or country in this case) more than any other game I tried with this theme. You have to make long-term plans, be careful about your income, about your energy needs and the enviroment, but it's also important to cash in the right tile at the right time. The gameplay is simple and elegant, the arwork is really cool and works perfectly with the theme and the game provides a nice challenge!

YetI've heard some worries about the replayability. Actually for a long time those comments stopped me from buying the game. Now that I tried it though, I can say that, while it's true that the buildings will be exactly the same each game, that's actually not an issue at all. In fact this allows you to plan much better for the long term and expoit your strategy even more. On the other hand, it also means that Prosperity it's not the kind of game you want to bring to the table very often. After a bunch of plays in a row, I'm good for a while. Nonetheless this is a very good game, that can provide a challenge, some interesing choices and a lot of fun, when the time is right. I'll hang on to it for sure.

A very painful balancing act! Be prosperous, but avoid pollution. Rules-wise, it's not a complicated medium-weight game (although the rulebook is just awful), yet it does smoke one's brain. And the man who designed the scoring track should be dragged out into the streets and shot.....

RATING: 5
A game of development in which you try to keep various elements in balance - or maybe not since lots of cash can make the problems caused by imbalance less worrysome. The need to over-build earlier developments, with the loss of their positive and negative contributions, can easily trip up the unwary.

The only interaction in Prosperity is of the denying the other guy the tile they want variety.  Otherwise, we are all playing on our own little boards. No thinking required until it's your turn again and you see your choice of tiles.

Prosperity has that pared down feel typical of Knizia games; there is not a single non-essential mechanism, no merely decorative feature.  While he has worked magic with minimal materials before, in Prosperity the net result is a game that's as dry and lifeless as the Kalahari.

By Ystari standards the artwork is a little disappointing.  Production quality is good.

RATING: 8.1
I like the intricacies of the systems involved, and they seem very nicely balanced.  I.e., it's hard to excel at everything--there's always a cost-benefit associated with every decision, and gaining an advantage in one element means taking on a disadvantage in another.

However, AP is definitely an issue, as every tile available on a player's turn (of which there are many) affects multiple systems on a player's player board.  Add to that the need to assess how taking tiles will affect opponents and their systems, and you have a recipe for a real brain burner.  Unbelievable, I know, considering it's a Knizia game.

This truly is a game that's shockingly simple (turns are simple: draw a tile, everyone scores the feature indicated on the tile, and take two actions) but incredibly deep (given the underlying systems involved and their interactions).  Sans the AP issue, this is the mark of a great game.

This a light game which emulates the growth and changes of a country over time. The rules are really simple, 20 minutes of reading, 5 of explaining, then play. The graphics belong to a different decade. The game plays OK with two, though it's quite repetitive and you have limited choices. The buildings are more or less the same and by the third part of the game there's nothing new. I will probably play it one more time, but the initial impression is that is below the my expectations (Knizia games should be good, right?). Not much more to say, for beginners it can be fun even over several plays, especially with changing the number of player from turn to turn.

RATING: 6.5
Got a full game as a demo during Essen Spiele 2013 (it was a very good demo, the very first during Spiele, with an explanation from Cyril, the head of Ystari: a very fun guy to chat with).

In the game you manage the growth of one of the major european countries (France, Germany, Italy, Spain) and the goal is pursuing prosperity (victory points) trying to avoid pollution.

The game is quite straightforward: there are 7 decades (from 1970s to 2030s) and 36 tiles (5 per decades, 6 for the last one). On each turn a players draws a tile and adds it to a central board, and everybody gets (or pays) something based on the symbol on the tile drawn. Then the turn player performs two actions (buying a tile and placing on its board, getting money, removing pollution). So in a 4 player game each player only draws 9 tiles and performs 18 actions.

The game is polished, without any baroque sub-system and quite abstract (as you expect from a game made by Knizia!), but is less obvious to play than I was led to believe by perusing the rules. In a single sentence: a good old euro from Ystari.

I had fun with it and it's the kind of game my S.O. likes, so I bought it immediately.

Initial tentative rating is 6.5.

This is a Knizia game that actually has a good theme. The balance between your ecology and your energy has to be maintained if you want to succeed. Moving up on the tracks to get the 1st shot at the better tiles is also crucial. This flows very smoothly and I plan to keep this around for a long time.

I was pretty unimpressed with this title.  Originally, I'd heard rumors that Knizia had put together another "bigger" game.  This definitely is NOT it.  It isn't a bad game, but underwhelming.  There is a lot of min-maxing and inching here and there to get the edge.  I may or may not ever play this again.

This is a tough game to rate. It was fun, however the easy side seemed too easy.  Have not played the harder side, and am very interested to do so, as I do think it will make the game more interesting.  However, even on the hard side, I am very concerned about replay-ability, since all tiles are used in every game.  

The theme actually does come through, unlike most Knizia games, which was cool.  Game does offer up some cool choices in a short play time.  

Update:
Ended up getting rid of simply because the game has no legs.  A solid design, but there are many other games that are better that scratch the same itch.

Easy to learn but lots of fun, and tough, choices.  You know what is coming, potentially, so the trick, I think, is to plan for it and then figure out when to switch to gathering up prosperity.  Hard to come back if you fall behind.

For 2-3 players it's an okay set collection and economic game where you manage a city via tile placement, and each tile impacts your income, energy, VPs or pollution levels. The game really doesn't scale well for 4p. A new building tile becomes available each turn, and the tiles serve as a game timer and randomizer for when each city attribute is scored (e.g., income, energy, trees/environment, research, VPs).  The game consists of 36 turns (total) regardless of the number of players.  The tiles are divided into 7 decades (1970-2030) with 5 tiles per decade and attribute scoring once per decade (and an extra tile with 2nd VP scoring added to the final decade).  Your pollution level must be managed throughout the game, and if your city is overrun with pollution, you cannot score VPs.  The problem with the game (especially for 4p) is that the scoring rounds happen so quickly that you don't have enough time to prepare for them even though you have some idea what type of scoring is coming up.  The game is somewhat fiddly because you're constantly recalculating multiple attributes to evaluate the impact of each potential tile purchase on your city.

Comprado en pedido conjunto a Ludobay en Marzo de 2017 por 3€ (En realidad se pidió en Noviembre de 2016 y llegó a principios de Marzo).

Es un juego de 2 a 4 jugadores (a 2 se queda un poco corto) de ir comprando losetas para mejorar diversos parámetros de la ciudad de cada trabajador. El precio de las losetas depende del nivel de investigación de cada jugador.
En su turno un jugador roba una loseta y provoca la evaluación de uno de los parámetros de la ciudad (energía, ecología, enconomía, prosperidad e investigación) y todos los jugadores evaluan dicho parámetro y aplican beneficios o penalizaciones.
Luego el jugador puede hacer dos de cuatro acciones posibles (limpiar, cobrar, investigar o comprar).

Es muy sencillo de jugar y de explicar y es perfectamente válido para no jugones. La gracia está en hacer los compras adecuadas que te permitan prosperar más que los demás.

RATING: 7
Great game, with a cool, if lightly pasted-on theme. It has Knizia's signature "mathy" balance, in that you are always trying to progress without overextending yourself. What I really like is the era-by-era scoring of each icon, where a push-your-luck element is introduced. If you know ecology is about to score, you can buy up a nice ecology building, even if you know it will temporarily ruin your energy track (just hope you don't score energy right away in the next era!). 

My only complaint is that the end of the game gets a little tedious, as you acquire globes and are just trying to break even with everything else. This can mean basically "passing" for your last couple of turns if none of the new buildings are useful to you. The game also runs a little long for what it is. I wonder if taking out one building from each era might make the game slightly shorter and less predictable (though knowing Knizia, it might break the game).

I thought Prosperity was a decent little game of balancing a few resources, while trying to score points.  However, I just didn't find anything that seemed too exciting.

Basically, on your turn, you draw a tile, which will designate which of 5 resources will score for all players.  Once everyone scores, you put the tile in play to be purchased along with all the other available tiles.  Tiles show some mix of resources they will either produce or reduce for having them.  You then get a couple actions.

Overall, you're trying to produce money, energy, and tech levels (the higher your tech, the cheaper buying tiles will be), while keeping your pollution as low as possible.  Whoever does the best job of that wins.

Overall, a game that registers as good but not great for me.

This game seems to work better with more players.  I bought this game primarily to play it solo, which turns out to be a bit pointless.  I like what I do in the game, but there's too many almost identical buildings for a small number of players.

This could probably be corrected by removing some of the buildings from the game.

Strong contender for "worst score track ever" award.

Pretty simple game. Seems a bit like Suburbia lite. There are five different symbols on tiles you can add to your mini-empire, which you add up, and then determines what you get (or lose) when that symbol comes up (about once every five turns). Unlike Suburbia, there is no special element. Player boards have a fixed set of locations to build, which are color-coded such that certain tiles go in certain spots. And you can overbuild (upgrade) tiles with new tiles. Overall it feels a bit lighter to me than Suburbia. I would call it a decent super filler. Also way more luck than Suburbia. But not too bad. Nice thematics of balancing energy and ecology in your city, with polution being a constant problem that needs to be addressed.

If Reiner Knizia puts his name on a game, old grizzled gamer geeks like me—okay, mature grizzled gamer geek, then, I'm still a chick compared to that established in 1949-bloke—sit up and pay attention. So with that in mind, I wanted to play a sample game of Prosperity and find out if enthusiasm was warranted or not.

Prosperity is, when it comes right down to it, a very clean and lean and mean economic growth game with a rather subtly hidden brake: buildings which give you better properties also come with negative properties, and the building it overbuilds (which is bound to happen sometime, space is limited) loses [i]its[/i] positive and negative effects too. Although you can slowly work your way out of a debt spiral, you don't do it by actually growing all that much. Which is insidious, even though you won't actually feel it as such while playing the game. In any case, actions are kept to a bare minimum, and investments to improve your situation are very minimalistic too.

The result is a title which I'm not sure was something which needed to be published in this day and age. In fact, coupled with the less-than-stellar artwork, it all feels rather dated and worn. Apart from the smooth braking mechanism there isn't anything memorable tied to this game which makes it stand out immediately. Well, that's not entirely true: it's neither a deck builder nor a worker placement game, which in itself is special at the time of writing. But you know what I mean. I'm also not sure that the game's patterns aren't going to be very boring after a few hands have been played: the rules encourage you to memorise when what new buildings will make their appearance. That is truly something which immediately piques my interest... not. There is also very little in the way of interfering with the other players: the only time you see each other is when the knowledge development is scored, and that tiles you are interested in might get picked up by someone else, and you can do zilch about that. That's it. In a game of 20th Century, which ostensibly shares some characteristics of creating your own little world with environmental problems, there is at least a nasty auction mechanism active which demands that the players put a relative price on tiles they wish to add to their domain; in Prosperity, the price is set by a formula.

Nice to have played a game, also nice to see that you quickly pick it up and can start experimenting with various strategies, but in the end I think this is a button pusher made to be forgotten. I certainly do not intend to spend more table time with it.

This a very, very pleasent game.

Although plain easy and fast to play, it requires some management skills to keep your country/city within the right balance between the levels of energy production and environment pollution, while, at the same time, producing money and creating condittions to obtain prosperity points (victory points). 
There is a nice integration with the theme, as the available tiles become more efficient as the "game years" go by. One must also keep an eye on the developments tracks, altough these investments not always seem to pay off, a minor upset of the game.
The other minor upset is that very often the game is decided by just one or two points difference at the end (the scores are too much tight).

This was the game I wanted 20th Century to be.  Having said that, I still can't say I love Prosperity.  There's a high degree of luck in the timing of the payouts and penalties, and having the perfect tile come out on your turn is huge.  I'm quite happy to play again if someone wants to, but I'm unlikely to want this for my collection.

RATING: 7
Players represent a European country, and guide it through seven decades of growth and prosperity.  A very simple tile drafting game - players on their turn flip a tile (from a deck of 36 tiles).  Each tile triggers a scoring payout in one of five categories (money, energy, research, ecology, prosperity).  Then that player takes two actions from a choice of four - draw money, discard pollution, gain research or purchase a tile.  Tiles are purchased from a market and go onto their player board, which instantly adjusts the payouts awarded when the tiles are flipped.  Most prosperity points at the end of the 36 tile draws wins the game.  

This is a fun and thinky little game, as you try and juggle the five spheres of scoring to your advantage, and gradually get your prosperity (i.e. victory point) engine up and running.  Very good game.

The designers of this game certainly get me salivating.  Who can resist a mid/heavyweight Euro by Reina Knizia?  Not me.  He hasn't done one in so long that the occasion should be celebrated.  And then add half of the brains behind Keyflower, Sebastian Bleasdale, and surely you have a winner.  Well actually no.  Prosperity is a reasonably engaging game but at heart is a very very dry Euro that cannot fail to at least a little disappoint given the A-list design team.  There is some theme: energy, pollution, ecology, research and ultimately prosperity; but really you are trying to delicately balance 5 variables which happen to have a name.  And the game is very well-balanced so that pushing one of those areas of development will lead to compromising elsewhere.  

We definitely had an issue with a runaway leader in the one game we played: if one person gets ahead in Prosperity Points in an early round then they will score these points each and every round so that the differential will grow each round until the other players can find a way back in, by which time is could be too late.

A játék maga nem bonyolult, fix 36 körös, és tényleg érezni, ahogy most inkább energia, és szennyezek, vagy védem a környezetet és próbálok mindenből "tisztát" építeni. Jól kiegyensúlyozott, sok út lehetőség. Bár a tegnapi 3-ból ez tetszett a legkevésbé, de egyrészt a hátlapok topok, a játék menet nagyon jó, a folyamatos őrlődés jó, viszont szinte semmi konfrontativátás -na jó, elveszem a másik elöl az adott lapkát.
A szabályban minden benne, és alapvetően logikus is, csak egyrészt a jeleket praktikus lett volna kitenni menetközben is, hogy ne kelljen visszalapozni, másrészt meg fixa ideájuk, hogy az egyik fajta lap az kék hátterű Hát max acélkék, de én inkább szürkének nevezném. :-)

Easy to learn game with a few interesting strategy decisions.  Technology tiles successfully evoke different time periods.  Some technology seems inappropriately rated, such a fusion power plant that produces a quarter of the energy of an oil-fired power plant or a communications network that requires four times the power of a national bullet train system.  Theme integration suffers from the fact that the designers chose not to print the names of the tiles on them (presumably in an effort to make the game language-independent).  I'd rather have had a label saying "Space Elevator" in any language rather than no label at all.

Quite liked it. We mistook the effect of energy/eco bonuses and maluses, so didn't apply enough, which would have made the game more swingy.

Not sure I'd buy a copy, but enjoyed playing and would play again. Some inter-action in seeing what was available and what the others might choose. Some luck in the timing of the tiles. Horrible scoring track, and too small icons and numbers.

Prosperity is a run-of-the-mill min/max optimisation game. Two kinds of resources that you need to keep at least somewhat balanced, and one or two ways to score points that obviously conflict with that balancing act.

It's a very clean and simple design, but also feels much more like a maths assignment than playing a game. I had expected more from a new "big" Knizia.

The only real interaction in Prosperity is grabbing a tile before anyone else, players have their own little board and go about their business in blissful isolation. From the moment that you start playing the game feels just too overfamiliar. There is little variety in the gameplay, the same tiles are introduced at the same time game after game, players start every game with the same set up, and the same scoring tiles come up every decade.

A sort of resource engine, tile laying game that forces you to balance your economic and energy growth against the pollution damage to the environment. There's good competition for the tiles, and the iconography design makes it easy to pick up and follow.

I'm very eager to try it again, but I fear that it won't have much meat to it after a few plays. 

UPDATE: Played this one again, and liked it a little more. It's definitely on the light-medium side, but the balancing act between the resources is more nuanced than I gave it credit for. Plus, knowing which tiles are worth paying a lot of money for increases the competition.

I was a bit disappointed, but that's merely a function of my excessively high expectations. A very good Knizia design, but not much of a gamer's game. The tempo of the various scoring elements is interesting, but perhaps too chaotic with more players. Board optimization coupled with limited actions is a fun little juggling act.

Although you only have 2 actions per turn, they are not always obvious, as you need to compare the advantages and disadvantages as well as the risks.  Do you simply upgrade or go for more as that resource tile has not come up...

Prosperity is a mid-weight tile laying game from a couple of my favorite game designers, Reiner Knizia and Sebastian Bleasdale.

Basis of the game is a series of player rounds where they are rewarded/penalized for the income producing/technological/ecological balance of their society; all players get the +/-, but then only the active player takes 2 actions.

Each round starts with a new tile indicating scoring type, benefits and penalties to build and terrain type, which then joins the market. 

There are about 5 tiles per decade from the 1970s to the 2050s, and the tiles are shuffled inside each decade, but time tracks in order decade to decade.

Because of the limited tile set, it seems a little scripted, but basically it reminds me a little of Suburbia: players try to maximize expected gains and minimize potential penalties in their countries by placing terrain tiles which effect ecology, industrial potential, economy, research and scoring.

Being strong in one often means getting hurt in a different category, and in the end balance if often rewarded.

It doesn't have variable rewards like Suburbia, nor does it have map building or as interactive (or variable) a market, but it does speed the reward/penalty rounds, and the internal math is a bit similar in flavor.

If you're looking for a lighter Suburbia, and building Castles in the sky isn't your thing, Prosperity might be it.

I normally am a fan of city builders, but I didn't like this one so much.  It felt perhaps slightly too constrictive, and I prefer it when the game allows you to build what you like and face the consequences afterwards.

We played a 4 player game and none of us were able to score more then 1 or 2 points until pretty much the last round, this might be because we weren't good players but I'm not convinced.  I think games should reward the players throughout, not just as it's about to end.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (September 2014)

It is not a bad game, however I was expecting something heavier from Sebastian Bleasdale (co designer of Keyflower). From Knizia I don’t expect much these days. I love some of his games, but I dislike most of his newer deigns, still it is a name that attracts me so I bought the game.

I really like the theme, I hope it raises awareness of the need to improve our energy sources and stop burning fossils. But I found the game has a lot of uncontrollable luck as in each decade some aspect will be scored randomly, so you can get hurt or get ahead just by the order of the tiles. Some of the tiles are clearly better than others (there are some that don’t have any penalties) so again it is luck if you can research one of the powerful ones on your turn. I like the color coded boards and technologies. Low strategy, high tactics.

The game rules are very easy to teach, you only have two actions per turn, so this allows for some interesting decisions (should I clean pollution, upgrade my research, buy a tile or get money).

A minor quibble, the rulebook is kind of bad, but readable. The scoreboard is awful, you can make mistake there easily.

I’m not sure the game has staying power for me. I’m willing to play it again, perhaps with less players to see if the luck factor decreases. But I think it will continue to go down in my personal ratings. I was expecting more from the duo Knizia/ Bleasdale.

Current Rating: 5.0

After another play, I’m upgrading its rating. This time I had much more fun as we played with the hard boards AND we knew that in each decade only one aspect is scored. Played this way is much more interesting as you keep track of what has been scored, but it still has a high luck of the draw factor. Also in the last decade (2030) the prosperity aspect is scored twice. That is not a problem but it would have been good to know beforehand.

Still a regular game but for now I’m hanging on it, just barely. I want to play again soon but only with the hard boards.

This is a very early first impression; I've only played the game once. I enjoyed this game. It's an interesting tableau building/balancing exercise. It's open information with very little variability, so it's definitely a game where the more experienced player will win. There are a lot of balls to keep in the air, and you really can't focus on any one area and expect to win. That may hurt it in the long run, I'm not sure. The theme works quite well with the mechanics.

This is a fun city building tile laying game. On your turn a new tile is added to those already available. Also the tile drives one aspect of everyone's economies. On each of your turns you can do two actions from a handful of different ones. The most interesting action is buying a new tile at auction with the better tiles costing more. Tiles have combinations of icons which can help or hurt your economy. You have to weigh these combinations relative to the price of the tile. Generating victory points is one of the resources, but there are some end game bonuses which can affect the final results.

As can be expected from Knizia, Prosperity's framework is reduced to the essence. To build up a nation, energy demands have to be met while keeping pollution in check as otherwise prosperity is threatened. Additionally, money has to be earned while progress must be achieved in research.

The mechanisms are clean. Draw a tile for the display, execute its effects for all players, then do two actions. The essential action is buying a tile, then making the necessary adjustments. All other actions are auxiliary to this aim. The interaction solely comes from snatching away tiles others want as well. 

Sharp tongues call it a spreadsheet. I like that the decision points are obvious while not trivial. Many seemingly deep games don't offer more decisions, they just hide this with complex rulesets. Scores were close, further plays have to show if there's more potential to differentiate.

A perfectly cromulent game that fails to excite. Seeing Knizia's name on an Ystari box was a huge initial draw, but ultimately it fails to rise above the rest of the field. I also dislike the ecological theme of the game. I am not a global warming denier or in favor of destroying the environment, but I find these themes preachy and clunky. But the game works.

Initial rating based on 3-player game.  I like how the trade-offs on the various tiles really make you think about how to maximize your score.  We took two hours to play our first game, not because the rules are tough, but to think about how the effects of our actions would impact us in future turns.  It's a very thinky, mathematical type of game that appealed to all three of us.

Fun game.  It's not at all what I was expecting even though I had no idea what to expect - I guess I was expecting something heavier and longer.  This is a good quick game.

The scoring track is not the greatest and the paper money is, well, flimsy paper money.

Offers different kind of ways to play (safety or take some educated risks) and had to say that Prosperity is a game which I like it more after I've played it more. Still not even close to perfect game: it's kind of sad, that all the tiles comes in play in every game and more or less in a same order.

[b][thread=1151528][/thread][/b]

This is a game by Reiner Knizia and Sebastian Bleasdale (of Keyflower fame) who’s contributed a lot to other Knizias as a playtester in the past decade. This is obviously not a game for everyone, also it’s not very interactive – but it already makes me happy that it’s an Eurogame without worker placement in 2013. 
The keyword is sustainable development. The game consists of 36 turns (which means you can have 18/12/9 turns in a 4/3/2-player game: I’d guess this game is better with fewer players than with more. Each turn starts with an [geeklist=156883]event[/geeklist] that has an effect on everyone, then the active player takes [geeklist=149163]two actions[/geeklist] just as usual from Knizia. You try to find the balance between research, income, pollution, ecology and energy in your country (this is fiddlier than a Knizia - it's Bleasdale I'd guess). And while the game is pretty simple and abstract, this theme is strongly represented by these tiles – you do have to feel and see how hard it is to be juggling between these aims: almost all developments have their benefits and bad sides as well, also you don’t even have enough space on your board for everything, so you constantly have to destroy something to add something else instead. Luck does play a role but the fewer the players the more you can count on the events that are to come. In the end it’s rather balanced: our 3-player game ended with a 32:31:30 score.  
(footnote: the rulebook is rather bad – even though everything is written there, it’s hard to understand and sometimes you can get the meaning of some sentences only from the examples; also when it refers to blue tiles those are grey tiles etc. Luckily almost all the necessary info is shown on the boards.)

Dropped rating to 4.  Meh, Don't really need to play this again.  My second play was only an hour but it felt like 2-3 hours!  There's just not much dynamic game play available and with the focus on prosperity, the secondary options don't make the game exciting.  Bleh.

========================================

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Interesting but not a game I need to own.  I realize the game is called Prosperity, so I suppose when one sees prosperity tiles one should focus a bit more on building those...  I'm not convinced there are many divergent paths to victory without a solid focus on prosperity tiles.  The other tiles will help you build an engine of sorts, but the points come from prosperity tiles.  I would have preferred a game with multiple paths to victory.

Very slim rules but the game requires a lot of thinking. 

With 2 players you might develope a little too fast, so at the end of the game there are not many choices left, the buildings become less and less attractive.
Maybe some additional buildings will suit very well to Prosperity.
I worry a little about replayability. The player boards re double sided, one is for advanced gamers, but I'm not sure if the varity of building should be bigger. A nice idea might be player boards with different nations and their specific advantages and disadvantages. But to be honest, I need a few more plays to talk about replayability.

I want to play this again to see if I'm more motivated to put more time in. I just wasn't wowed, but I was surprised that for all of the comparisons drawn to other games, such as Suburbia, this is quite different. The eras give you the chance to make choices more predicatively, but in the end I do wonder if the overall system won't be a little shallow.

You can certainly feel Knizia's influence. It's a shame he doesn't invest himself into attempting more heavier fare these days.

First impression after one play.  It brings nothing new to the table, another Knizia game that does nothing to stand above a crowd of similar games.  Mostly MPS, with random luck that can determine the odds of you getting the tile you need at the right time, downtime, very little interaction other than seeing other players take the tile you wanted for yourself.  The game feels starved, with little room for movement, improvisation, very reactive and limiting.  The art is mediocre, the theme pasted on.  I would rather play something else

RATING: 6.9
Simple rules with some interesting game play.  It's the choices and the wondering what will come next that make it interesting.  In practice I found it frustrating that my opponent and I always wanted the same tile. (Yes, there were plenty of other reasonable choices, but it happened so often.)  A little too puzzle-y for me, though dh appreciates the relatively high level of interest generated by such a simple rule set.

You get an engine in motion. Then you have to tweak it here and there as it goes by adding and replacing elements. There are few things you can change: power production and usage, waste production and cleaning, economy, science and prosperity. Great idea and it plays really well. You really feel that you create country from very high perspective. 
Managing all of that is really great and satisfaing. I have to play it more to be sure it works after more plays.
It is as dry (or not at all) as most of other euros. For me parsonally theme is captured exceptionally well.

It seemed pleasant enough, but the game seemed to almost play itself.  The end was anticlimactic in that there were no more interesting tiles to buy and we ended up just taking money for the last few turns.  We played on the easy side, so maybe it's better on the hard side.  Also, we played with two -- maybe it's not good with that player count.

Overall, it seemed like a very light game masquerading as a Eurogame.  The rule book makes it look like there's more than there actually is -- it only takes about five minutes to explain the rules of the game.

There's just some disconnect with this game.  I'm thinking its the theme and scale.  Its a game of balancing resources in a developing city but it just felt too small or something.  You never seem to get more than what you started with.  Theres just a handful of resource scales.  I think this game just needed to be bigger in every way.  The theme didn't come through enough and it seemed like the game was based on it so it really mattered.

I'm initially liking this one.  I enjoy the overall play and weighing the cost/benefit of each action.  The modern theme makes it feel a bit weird alongside other Ystari classics like Yspahan, Ys, or Caylus, but the dry, thinky nature makes it fit right in, which I like.  I'm not sure how well this will hold up to numerous plays -- there's not much variability in the setup or tiles but there are certainly different strategies you could focus on from game to game.  The weight and play time feel very good -- thinky but not heavy, and plays in about 60 minutes.  It doesn't seem to have clicked too well with the others I've played with, but I'm looking forward to exploring it more.

Mezcla de autores, Knizia y uno de los autores del Keyflower.

Por duración es casi un filler. Seguramente no tenga 100 partidas, pero yo llevo 4 y me divierte. Hay que compensar el cobro de 7 recursos diferentes, y ver cuando descompensar la balanza es la clave del juego.

Develop your country over the decades from the polluting inefficient industry of the 1970s, to the more energy effivient and environmental options in the 2030s. The person who can make their country the most prosperous wins.

Every decade score energy, environment, research, income and globes once, so you try to balance and predict what condition comes up next to make your country come out favorably. Really fun, while also relatively simple.

This probably needs more than a single play, but quite a disappointment! I had high expectations because of the designers, especially Bleasdale, coming off of Keyflower (though I'm a fan of On the Underground as well). I approached the game with a see-saw attitude, swinging from one track to the other to make gains. What I found was a system that appeared perhaps *too* balanced. It's not until the fifth tier that I can actually make a net-profitable trade, rather than dooming one track to benefit another. Now, the score contrast at the end was huge, so clearly another player had a better idea of what he was doing than I (or was just lucky--he was 10 years old, after all), but I never felt in control of this game and never felt my moves were progressive. Just a shell game of neutrality. Dull.

Played 8 times for basic board so far.
(haven't tried the advanced board. So this comment is preliminary)

It is Knizia's first game with another designer, first game from Ystari, first game with player's boards (except Rio Grande's Medici :), and first game with phase dependent deck (except Palazzo). I had very mixed feeling about the game before I play as it is so not Knizia-like.

The game is not bad, or rather interesting for having such a few player interactions. I see that many factors are streamlined in Knizia's way. Also it has quite many ways for victory. So that keeps my attention to the game.

I will see how I feel about the game after I play the advanced board several times.

Micro-fine balancing act and one of those key 'evolution' games where learning the tech tree (one of my most hated activities) isn't the be-all and end-all. Despite being simply about controlling a few sliders, it's surprisingly immersive and engaging. I'm a bit disappointed that the starting boards aren't asymmetric (or even symmetric with different art?), but this looks to be good expansion and/or homebrew fodder.

Basically a tile drafting game, but where you'll often want to take actions other than taking tiles to accumulate money or research in order to get to the better tiles in the draft. The tiles are added to your tableau, and your energy and eco go up/down depending on the icons on the tiles you buy. Having everything up is good. Sadly the tiles don't make that easy, as there's lots of combinations where something goes up at the expense of the other going down. And anytime you want to buy a tile which awards bonus money, bonus research or bonus VPs, it's usually at a cost of your energy and eco going down as well. So the game is a balancing act. But it's a tactical balancing affair ... you're taking from the tiles that are left you and that's that. There's no sense of I'll leave that tile until next time because no one else will want it until then. With 20+ tiles to choose from, it's hard to get any sense of what other people might take or want, so just take what's best for you at a reasonable price for the moment. You can try different strategies like money rich or research rich, but other than that there's a sense of sandbox play, just doing the best you can as best you can. It's pretty light and ticks along nicely, being at the lighter end of the Euro spectrum. Not sure how much replay there is though given that the same tiles come out in much the same order each game. Pleasant game fodder.

"Clever game that is straightforward but is a fairly deep brain-burner. It plays a bit abstract for my tastes, but that is offset by my appreciation for the theme that is there."

What I like:
- Love the theme, balancing progress with pollution
- Straightforward but reasonably deep
- Multiple paths to victory (but not point salad)
- No pvp attacks or major screwage

What I don't like:
- Plays a bit abstract (names on the tiles would help)
- Cubes should be a bit smaller, to fit better
- Score tracks are a bit messy
- I would prefer a bit of variability in the setup

I basically agree with the BGG-voted 2.7 weight. I would put the complexity around 2.4, but there is quite a bit of depth. It seems like the 60 minute length should be accurate.

This is another one of my games that I really like that is under appreciated on BGG!  It's from the same guys who brought us Ra and Tigris & Euphrates (Knizia) and Keyflower and Black Fleet (Bleasdale).  That's quite a team!  It's city-building-tile-placement!  Yes!  This game has a great balance of strategy (do you pick an energy path, ecology path, some of both?) and tactics (you must always pay attention to the tile flip at the beginning of each turn, which determines which of the five 'areas' gets triggered that turn.  In each round the same five areas will always be triggered, so paying attention to that is key!  Then you must choose your two actions each turn (from 4 total options) after the tile flip.  The game moves fast at first, but then you have to start building tiles on top of others, and then you really start to think and plan even more.  Good tension and pacing!  Excellent game.  Lots of fun!

This is a great concept by a great designer, but unfortunately it fell flat for me. 

The game wasn't really thematic enough for me. The whole game just felt like a point optimization exercise, with no real immersion into the concept at all.

Prosperity is an easy-playing fast-flowing game where you're trying to acquire tiles that will help or hurt your economy, and also help or hurt your pollution level.  Most tiles are a mixed bag, especially given that you have to pay for them.  Later, you can replace tiles you've already bought, removing the old icons from your tableau, but adding new ones.  The game is definitely a balancing act between the various aspects of your board, but it seems like helping the environment is the key to victory points.  I thought this was a nice quick game.

This game is starting to lose some of its charm with me. It started off strong and knowing how and when the tiles score made a big difference. But after a little more than a dozen plays, I feel like I've seen almost all this game has to offer. It really needed a way to add a touch of variety in the game. Simply having 5 tiles come out each age in a random order isn't a significant enough change to keep the game fresh.

The biggest issue is the god damn score track. Blegh! Snaking track that is super easy to bump. And since points are incredibly tight in the game, it's just poorly done.

2014-01-25: I like this game. Just spent about 20 mins to learn it, taught by a friend. After knowing the rule, feel it is not a complicated game. But you need to care about a lot of things to win. Your money, energy, Ecology, research, pollution, etc. I have tried to get rich, ignored the pollution and tried to use money to solve the ecology problem but failed. It really can give me an understanding that we need to take care about our pollution problem at the very beginning before it is too late. An innovative game. I found it is under-rated in BGG.

Prosperity is a so called 'dry' game. This seems to be typical for Ystari-games and normally I don't have a problem with this. However this game (only 1 play so far) just felt dull. On others players turn you do a certain scoring (which ain't that exciting) and then you just wait. There's no point in planning ahead, because the tile you're aiming for probably will be gone when it's your turn. 
The tile distribution is an other problem I had with this game: some tiles just seem to be better then others. That means that you have to be lucky to draw a good one on your turn or have the luck that your opponent simply can't afford it.

All considered this felt like a multiplayer solitaire, but not an exciting one I'm afraid.

I loved this game after my first play of it, over a year ago. Returning to it, the shine is gone. The game has some things going for it. I like how you need to manage the two technology branches to get your board's resources to balance. I like how you want to manage your pollution levels.  Trying to time your build actions to catch the next semi-predictable event is also a lot of fun. The problem is the game has a little too much flip luck, not enough players can do to catch up when flipluck kicks them in the balls, long downtime between turns, and poor graphic design. This is solidly in the ok but not great camp.

Card drafting, tile placement.
A classic Euro style game where you increase your country's prosperity by managing and manipulating your balance of resources (energy, ecology, capital, and research) where keeping an optimum balance will gain you the most prosperity.  
Pros:  
Plays really great with 2 players.  I like that there's not much conflict back and forth between the opponents.  Each player has control over his own outcome and isn't affected much by what the other player does.
Cons:
It's a little hard to get thru the 1st game and understand the rules.  The paper money is poor quality. 
If one player starts getting a significant lead, it is very hard to catch up.

RATING: 7
As I expect from Knizia, the rules are simple and sound too simple but the game has emergent depth and the emotional feel of never liking your options.  Every tile-buy feels painful, but you never feel locked.

It may be too hard to catch up if you fall behind in the mid-game, but I'm not sure.

The game is certainly tilted (at least slightly) towards emphasizing ecology over economy.  You can't ignore either, but there are several rules that tilt the balance.  Having excess ecology is twice as good (in terms of action point efficiency) as having excess power, and having low ecology scores you points (which can be decisive over the course of the game).

The components and info representation are nice except that the cubes are too big for their tracks (and the scoring track winds around confusingly).  Replacing them with smaller cubes helps a lot!

I liked the game 3 player.  I worry that it would suffer with more -- more downtime and less ability to plan around upcoming events.

Update: Better with three players. Plays okay with two as well. Two or three players sees more tile selection choice and overbuilding in comparison to the four player game. Turns go by quicker and the game feels less scripted.
--------------------------
Not sure whether this one has any legs. The same tiles each game appear in only a slightly different order. Playing three or two players might be better because you'll have more turns and more tiles to place on your board, so you'll have a better selection and be building over buildings more often.

What it does it does fairly well though. Easy to digest rules. Quick turns. Plays in under an hour. Not too bad but feels like some sort of expansion might make it hit the table for repeated plays.

What the hell were they thinking when they designed that scoring track? You wind your way back and forth and more than once a player will bump their oversized cube off the correct tiny square, or move it in the wrong direction. It's just rubbish. Not since Capitol has a scoring track been this bad. Not that a scoring track that works is important or anything.

Another slight disappointment is that the names of the tiles are not printed on the tiles. I enjoy reading out what the tiles are from the cheat sheet, but sadly the multi language printing leaves this neat thematic enhancement off the tiles themselves.

It will reward good play but in a moderately subtle way.

Another build-your-economy-without-wrecking-your-ecology game. I liked the idea of constantly having scoring rounds of various kinds, so you have to optimize the entire time and not just the situation at the end.

However, the relatively strict ordering of the cards and their type system -- green cards can only be built on green spots, et cetera -- seemed to very much restrict the possibilities, and probably reduce replay value a fair bit.

It also is really hard to go for one specific strategy, because you might simply not be able to acquire the cards for it before someone else gets them.

Nor is it possible to play a strategy that focuses on one specific area. For example, you cannot go for building lots of power plants and using the generated electricity for powering lots of energy-intensive (but otherwise awesome) buildings, not so much because you would not be able to cope with all the waste from the power plants, but because there simply are only two spots for power plants available in your town. And if someone buys the strong ones before you, tough luck.

In short: Decent enough game, but I'll choose 20th Century over it any time.

This is a decent tile drafting game. The tech tree is interesting, as it changes the prices of the tiles and also is an area-control competition. There is a nice balance of trying to time when you get tiles so as to maximize the benefits and avoid penalties. Still, with each tile quite important, the game does move a bit slowly, and really only best with 2 or 3.

I like the theme of balancing development with environmental sustainability. The game's arc makes sense within that framework. But it's rather repetitive, a bit dry, and I don't expect there to be a ton of replay value. Still, it's a solid euro with an intuitive ruleset that plays quickly, and it's not a worker placement or resource conversion game.

1 play, 4er

Dry Dry DRY! I did NOT like it 4-player, at all: the game felt tedious, random, and overly mathy at the end (trying to optimize based on the last tile flips)! With each player getting basically just one turn per decade (1.25, actually), the outcome seemed overly weighted towards whoever happened to get lucky on the tile flips! It's a game about optimizing your chances to profit from whatever the tile flip might show, but that seemed way too difficult to accomplish in a 4-player game.

And why have that awful score track?!? It seems designed to have players make errors moving those little cubes! Also, it would've been nice to have little tracks for research, euros, and prosperity. And maybe a prettier board? Or not -- it felt like a pretty abstract game anyway, with players just trying to balance 5 different things at the right times.

However, it seems like it should be an interesting balancing act of a game so I'll have to try it with 2 and/or 3 players.

--------
Played it again, 2-player.

Confirmed: yup, I REALLY don't like this game! The whole time, I'm annoyed when I don't get a tile flip that I want at the right time! And I'm constantly thinking that I'd have more fun writing a program -- that would remember all the tiles, calculate the odds or what was going to come up next, and make the best (most optimal) play each turn -- than actually playing this game. And I'm not even really a programmer!

For fans of abstract games with some random elements, this is probably a solid game. But it is definitely not for me!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Setup is the same: a set of tiles are placed into 2 markets (ranks 1-6), with player's markers in rank 1. Each rank has increasing numbers of steps (= rank + 1). A stack of tiles (5/decade; 6 in last decade) is created by shuffling each decade's tiles, then stacking them. Players play either on the basic or advanced side of their player board; these show different starting buildings and Energy/Ecology levels. Start with 8 pollution discs (on a track, some of the spaces of which have a Prosperity icon). Also, 100 euro each.

On your turn, flip a tile; then, EVERYONE scores whichever of the 5 resources is indicated:
- Energy (bolt): earn money if you're in the good range, or, if in the bad, either pay money or take pollution discs
- Ecology (tree): either remove or place pollution discs
- Research: in turn order, move your marker(s) upwards in rank according to the number of Research icons in your display
- Income: earn 100 euro per euro symbol in your display
- Prosperity: earn 1 VP (on that horrid VP track) per Prosperity icon visible on your player board

Then, YOU take any 2 actions:
- take 100 euro
- advance 1 step in a market
- remove 2 pollution discs from your Prosperity track
- buy tile from market, cost based on position of your research cube on that market track: anything of lower rank costs 50, same rank = 100, higher rank = 100 + 100 per rank above you. Place tile on your board, possibly covering another tile (update your positions on Energy/Ecology tracks accordingly)

After the last tile is placed, final scoring:
- 2 Energy scorings
- 2 Ecology scorings
- Euro scoring, then buy VP for 300 euro each
- Research scoring, but advance up BOTH market tracks. Players in 1st/2nd place earn 3/1 VP
- Prosperity scoring
Most VP wins.

RATING: 7
In this game players each take on the role of a country and are trying to make it the most prosperous across several decades.  The way this is done is through building a tableau of sorts of different buildings.  At the start of each players turn a building tile is drawn from a stack and this stack goes through 5 tiles for each decade.  The tile not only becomes a new building available for purchase but also dictates which of the 5 statistics is activated for all players that round which is the neatest part of this game.

Each building tile in a player's tableau has different stats on it in 5 different categories; energy, ecology, research, economy, and prosperity.  Each gives you a different benefit and there are often trade-offs, the most common of which is usually the more ecological a building is the more it hurts your energy production and vice-versa.  This makes the decisions for what you build in your country very interesting as you often have to take some amount of bad with the good.

The game is reasonably accessible and also reasonably quick.  The artwork and components are fine and the points are very tight so this game can often end with scores very close.  I think the best feature of this game is the variability of strategies and the need to either balance statistics or sacrifice one for another.

Knizia is a co-designer of this game and it certainly has that puzzley feel that I equate to a lot of his games.  There's no wonky scoring mechanic but he is only co-designer after all.

Simple game with a difficult amount of decisions but mainly with a difficult pollution aspect to solve during play. Players seem to be too much penalized for taking the pollution to a higher scale and that sometimes can hurt a player's game because one may not find an opportunity to get the right building. Timing is everything in Prosperity because events happened randomly.

The structure is a bit written and we need new buildings and new stuff to give the game more replay ability or else is maybe a bit too static and closed.

Either way, very nice game!

Game play - min/max  is not disguised by the theme. Need to play again to see if there is much more to it. Quite simple mechanics.

2nd game and this, given the pedigree of the designers, is a woeful effort. Linear, repetitive and lacking in finesse or tension. On sale pile.

Damn ystari and the colour choices of their games - all of them terrible for colour blind gamers - Caylus, Assyria, Olympos and now this game all difficult bordering on impossible to play for the colour blind. It would be defensible if the games graphic design was actually interesting or attractive - but it is not ; the tiles are ugly.

However this could be the most beautiful and colour blind friendly game in the word - it would not disguise the fact its not very interesting to play

Knizia scores another (should be) hit with a tight engine builder where you have to balance all your attributes - Energy, Ecology, Prosperity, Income and Research - because they all contribute to your score, every decade and/or at the end. Very under-appreciated game that I hope rises in the rankings!

Enjoyed this. Simple rules, some engine-building & resource-balancing. From a single play, choices didn't seem obvious, and different approaches all had potential.

That said, it [i]is[/i] one of those heads-down zero-interaction optimisation games, so not for everyone. Reminds me of Industrial Waste, in a way.

Knizia's new output hasn't been on my radar for years. His more recent games always play well (they always have) but they all seem developed to the point where they feel lifeless. His last game I actually liked enough to add it to my collection was the (highly underrated) [thing=29410][/thing], but we must remember that that was designed years and years before it was actually published. So this game was mostly on my list because of Bleasdales involvement and the Ystari logo on the box.
I must first say that this game is ugly. There are some nice pieces of art in there, and I like the individual players boards, but for the most part the design of the whole thing is ugly.
Game play does feel very Knizia-y. Flip over a tile, score the indicated element and perform 2 of a set of very straight forward actions.  And it plays well. And it does again feel quite lifeless. And I don't expect there to be too many different strategies to explore. It's not a bad design, but it's not one that anyone will be requesting any time soon.

This looked pretty dire from the rules, but played much better than it read. Alas, it also felt a bit generic and I really don't see any variety in play from play since all the tiles always come out and they're always grouped by decade.

It's certainly at the lighter end of the spectrum and two of us considering buying it, but by day's end had decided against it.

I liked Prosperity ... it has an elegant simplicity that still allows for multiple strategies and styles of play. It's deadly for a player like me who likes to build infrastructure and then score late in the game ... I think players have to be scoring at least some points every round to stay competitive.

Ordinarily, tile-laying games do not present interesting enough decisions for my tastes, but Prosperity is the exception.  Each tile can affect the balance of any of 5 resource tracks, which generally must stay in harmony to win the game.  Prosperity combines the lightness of tile-laying with intellectually-challenging choices.

RATING: 6
Not too bad. The game has a nice, easy flow to it: flip a tile and then carry out a quick scoring of one of the key areas, take two actions, move on to the next person. Very simple, but there are quite a few decisions to make because you're constantly increasing in certain key areas while decreasing in others. It does seem like the luck of the scoring tiles can have an influence, but this creates kind of a push-your luck element.

A good little city builder. I think I actually might like it as much, possibly more with more plays, than Suburbia. They feel very similar.

Each turn is executed in two parts: 
(1) The active player draws a decade tile (there are five in every decade - this triggers the scoring/resource collecting of one of 5 different types of resources.
(2) The active player may perform two actions. Among the actions, the most common is to purchase a new tile and add it to your city. Each tile usually has a give-and-take feel to balancing out your economy.

The timing of the decade tiles heavily influence the prosperity of your city. I liked my two plays of the game and if I had the chance to pick it up, I might do it. Although I'm not sure there is space in my collection for this AND another city builder, like Suburbia.

This one is a winner for me because I like the constant checks for each resource.  It is a bunch of balancing acts.  Needs to deliberately be played at a nice clip, and a certain type of player will unnecessarily suffer AP.  Light-medium games which are far tactics based over strategy based at a are not my cup of tea, but I recognize they are easy games to get to the table.  So if we're going to play a game like this, this will be one of my first choices as I like the required flexibility based upon reacting to which tiles other players are going for, and the fact that while resources are introduced to everyone during the course of the game, its slightly different for everyone depending on the board.  

I strongly dislike the beginner board.  It shortens the beginning of the game and essentially you start in the middle game using it.  It is pretty remarkable how a two resource swing caused that to happen.

I'm pretty happy the extreme strategies are viable with a the right tiles being available. Most players will go down the middle trying to balance things, and rightfully so as it allows for mistakes and less reliance on the other players ignoring your strategy.  Nifty evolving resource values while looking for efficiencies against other players.

Coming off the success of Keyflower, Bleasdale teams up with the venerable Knizia to create an efficiency game. The result is an entertaining but rather bland game. The action selection is rather straight forward as players pick up tiles and score each round, followed by the usual "Knizia double-action" turn. The options are rather limited and late in game, the options can come down to which buildings are available for purchase to score additional victory points. The game scoring is relatively tight as player battles for points by purchasing building upgrades. The points do not appear in glut as there is only one scoring opportunity per decade and only so many buildings with the prosperity icon. So, deciding when to purchase these prosperity buildings at the expense of ecology or clean energy is key to victory. Overall, the game is good, not great as I noticed that sequence of tiles coming out can really determine what is available for purchase that round. If you continually get hosed with building selection, the game may become frustrating.

Mediocre.  The infrastructure build-up is actually rather satisfying at first, but there's a frustratingly high level of swingyness in the order tiles come out.  The endgame is also lackluster, as your purchases become tiny tweaks or upgrades that feel less worthwhile.

OK game but nothing really new or very exciting. more tactical than strategic, less enjoyable with more players because you can only act/adjust your tactics on "your" turns, but still score on each opponents turn...

[+] simple rules, not too many choices on your turn, good tactical options, easy to keep track of the different values (energy, environment...)
[-] very forgettable artwork & theme, terrible scoring track, too much number crunching (when replacing building), some doubts about replayability, with 4p you only have actions once per period, so you can not really adjust to what's already scored/ what's comming, so less interesting in my opinion.

would be interesting to try with 2p...

got in MathTrade jul16
gone in MathTrade Nov16

UP: played it more times with 4p and my initial impressions are confirmed. Also tried 2p, there's a bit more to do but it still just an OK game. the research bonus in 2p are a big deal.

(4/2016) - Interesting city building game - balance economic and environmental impacts, pollution, score VPs.    Do not play with 4 - only get 9 actions.   I prefer it with 3 players - tension and 12 rounds.   Very good at 2 as well when you have 18 turns.

Another "solid 7" Euro from Knizia, showing that though he hasn't scored any recent home runs, he can still hit a double that gets your attention.  Some tough choices on increasing your infrastructure versus taking on more pollution.  Maybe this was his obligatory "green theme" design.  The game moves pretty quick until the last few rounds when you could get AP trying to figure out what will get covered and replaced, changing your levels in scoring areas.

A very nice and simple eurogame with completely different but equivalent paths to victory, very tense and somehow exciting.
The most striking thing is exactly this: it is incredibly balanced and tight.
Only thing that prevents me to give an 8, so far, is that it doesnt seem splendidly original, there's nothing glaringly new. But some more plays could convince me to raise this a bit, i am sure.

Surely one of the best "late Knizia games"

This was on super sale as a daily deal at Miniature Market so I picked up a copy and I'm glad I did!  The turns are fairly simple as you only have two actions and usually are taking money or buying a tile with them... but the tiles seem well designed to make for tough choices with your limited space while trying to play the odds to be in the best position to take advantage of the different event scorings makes the game very interesting at times.  Maybe not something I'll get out and play a lot, but its a really nice, quick laid back Euro best with 2 or 3 when I need one!

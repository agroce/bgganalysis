GAME: The Eagle and The Star
RANK: 4105
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Love the concept and theme! One of the best games I've ever played. Has a few simple but at the same time fantastic and unique mechanics like placing and resolving orders, resolving battles (diceless).
Although the mechanics are simple, in order for the game to play smoothly it requires a bit more experienced wargamers (can't imagine you could play the campaign game in less than 8h - unless sudden death occurs) - there is quite a lot of decision making.
Ok. I think there are some components and rules issues, historical/geographical inaccuracies, the campaign game probably wasn't playtested long enough... All I had to do was to implement a few house rules (actually still working on them). If not for that my rating would be at least 9.

RATING: 8
A card driven game that offers four ways to use the card; for orders (think ops points), for an event, to gain replacements, or to add to your strength in combat.  What makes the Eagle and the Star really interesting is a system of programmed moves (the orders).  This combines with an initiative system that obliges the player without it to place their orders first - giving more than a hint of their intentions - and implement those orders second.  There's also diceless combat, which, like Combat Commander, adds a random element through card draws.  That randomness can be cancelled by playing a card from your hand, but my are those precious! 

Block density on the huge map is low.  Combat can be bloody, so gaps will quickly appear.  However, low movement allowances, severe penalties for going out of supply, and limited numbers of orders mean that this isn't quite the game of fluid manoeuvre that you imagine.  Nonetheless, the Eagle and the Star offers plenty to think about.

Production quality is mixed.  The map is printed on decent cardstock and the cards are good quality with nice artwork.  The counters were really poorly die cut and some of the labels are peeling from the blocks.  The rules were not as bad as I'd been led to expect, however the descriptions of events on the cards are frequently incomplete or ambiguous.  The confusion over place names between the rules and the map was just unnecessary.  Do download the FAQ and errata.

I've played only the first scenario, but it seems that this is a very solid game. 

Initially it looked like that the soviets wouldn't be any match for the Poles, but I was wrong. The game is balanced and with great events.

It might raise to a 9. I need to play it again to make my mind.

--------------

Played the II scenario. The game is excellent and well balanced.

The game could easily be a 9 if the production was better. Although I'm playing the initial version, not the commercial one, it seems that the final version has some of the "old" problems.

Even though... its on my top 10 ;)

Temporary rating

Big old map, some very interesting mechanisms.

The rules left me confused as to some of the main mechanisms, esp. as it seemed some different terms might refer to the same thing. I have temporarily packed it away for clearer fare.

excellent jeu aux méchanismes qui changent beaucoup de l'ordinaire mais qui sont bien prenants.
mais par contre le matériel à vraiment quelque problème (pas de noms de rivières, cartes parfois mal traduites, regles imprécises...) ce qui gache un peu. c'est pas grand chose mais c'est dommage.
ceci dit le jeu en vaut largement la chandelle

Very initial rating after a read of rules & 1/3 game played but don't expect much movement

Finally another GREAT wargame with no dice! (thank the lord, and Robert Zak :) ) Almost everything is here that I would want in a wargame and low rules overhead with logical and intuitive rules to boot, a very short rulebook for this kind of game (err maybe a little too short, apparently with more play some questions come about...).  A card-driven block game with Fog of War and Supply lines, no direct comparisons I can think of but it combines several things from good games like Hannibal and Rommel and/or NT. TONS of options in play which I REALLY love, cards used in 4 different ways (orders, combat modifier, events or reinforcements), lots of different orders to give, 2 options on how to modify combat, movement options like rail, defense and withdraw plus more.  The game definitely has some bluff and tension too as the orders given are done according to initiative and they are done FACE DOWN which makes it quite interesting and more realistic really. 

The only thing I would have liked to see would be tanks, planes and maybe ships (I know not part of this war, damn, I thought this game might be everything I wanted in a wargame and thus not have to design my own, its close) along with units having more differences than just cavalry and infantry, like leaders having an effect on surrounding units, things like that.  Low luck overall, some card draw of course, a little in the combat but overall one of the lowest I have seen for a wargame like this, can't comment on balance at this point of course.  That is a pretty small nitpick and the only one I can level here other than maybe components and jeepers that map is BIG. Gameplay is exactly what I hoped it would be and right now this has the potential to overtake Hannibal and become my favourite wargame.  

Sidenote - IIRC, this does not have the delicious tension in cardplay from TS where you get stuck with a hand of crap and try to wiggle your way out of it (few games do though), I don't believe you get forced to play an opponent event or two like TS but could be wrong. Note that I think what it lacks in that specific tension, it has in it in other ways (FOW, simultaneous face down orders) and much more too, its also more of a "Wargame proper" than TS is and fills in most of those areas where TS lacks.

That game contains a lot of innovations: fog of war, units are represented as blocks, battle modificator... It's infortunate that 'The Eagle and The Star' isn't popular wargame.

Rating after 3 plays of scenario 1 against different opponents. A perfect blend of block game, CDG and bluff generated through operational order counters.  Simply splendid!

Has special significance for me as my father was a Polish uhlan in the conflict.

Excellent rendering of the Polish-Bolshevik war of 1920: Very clever diceless design with the right touches of control, unpredictability, bluff and fog of war!

This game is better played with two Soviet players and it's good having a great three players game around.

The rules are not difficult to understand, but leave a lot of unanswered questions. Fortunately, the Designer is very responsive and helpful!

With a clear rulebook (and with another font - yuck!) this game deserves a 10!

UPDATE: Rating downgraded from 8.5 to 7

Even after having spent more than 50 hours trying to produce clear rules (see my file here on BGG) there are still rules disputes arising during play! The fact that "Strike of the Eagle" has been published with different interpretations of the rules (the way the orders are placed on the board or the fact that Recon Orders are resolved immediately after Quick Move Orders, for instance) does not help either! There are also disputes concerning cards interpretations... All that is becoming rather annoying!

For some reason, playing the disappointing attempt to deal with the blemishes (which I now realise are considerably worse than I first thought) in this game in Strike of the Eagle has really cooled me off to this game. I include my initial comment below as a reminder of the level of excitement it first generated.
____________________

This is a brilliant game; although it is very different, my first play gave me the feeling that I had when I played Angola and Twilight Struggle of a unique and exciting game. It takes the best things about block games (the fog of war) and CDGs (the difficult choices about whether to use a card for ops or as an event), but adds two highly innovative elements: a) when you take ops, you can choose a number of different orders tokens which you place face down on the units you wish to move or the space you want them to go to; during the turn, the orders are revealed with certain types of orders going before others: this creates great tension, as when your opponent gives an order to a unit you want to attack, you do not know, for example, if it has been told to force march away before you arrive, defend the space or conduct a tactical withdrawal; b) the combat system is diceless; battle cards can be played, the effects of orders and flanking attacks calculated and the size of the two forces added; in addition, a random element is introduced in that you turn over a card from the deck and add its battle rating, though if you dislike it, you can always substitute a card from your hand, possibly trading off future actions for current benefit; all of this is done in stages, so you are making decisions about what resources to commit without actually knowing the full strength of your opponent's forces, or whether he got lucky pulling a card from the deck. The result is a tense game of bluff and counter-bluff in which you have to try to outmanoeuvre your opponent (looking for the all-important flanking attacks, or even trying to surround him) on the vast, empty plains between Poland and Russia. The importance of manoeuvre reminds me a little of Napoleon's Triumph, but this is a far more accessible game. All in all, it is worth repeating that this is a quite unique gaming experience. I also particularly like the fact that most cards come with a short description of the event they portray.

One must mention that the game has a number of blemishes. Two of these are related to production quality: a) the counters have been poorly printed, meaning you will have to spend a lot of time cutting them out with a knife for pretty unsatisfactory results; it doesn't break the game, but it is a pain in the dupka; however, the designer says this was only a problem in the initial printings and he is willing to send replacement copies; b) more importantly, the proofreading of the cards and rules by a native speaker was unpardonably shoddy; some improvements have been made in comparison to the cards originally presented on BGG, but they are still far from perfect and sometimes you really have to guess what the intention of the card is; with regards to the rules, this is less of a problem as living rules can always fix the errors, but in the case of the cards we are stuck with what we have: frankly, I think the proofreader really had no idea of what was expected of him. Nevertheless, there are problems with the rules beyond the proofreading. A number of important pieces of information seem to be simply missing. For example, I don't think it says anywhere in the rules that you should set up the garrisons at the beginning of the game. None of this is catastrophic and I think once there is an errata or v.2 of the rules, these problems will be resolved. However, I am a little worried that some will try it, be frustrated at the gaps and oddities in the rules and simply give up on a game which really is very good.

Pretty complicated, but I am new to grand strategy games. I love the idea and the history of this campaign so I give it a solid 10. Unfortunately the rule booklet is not designed to explain everything step by step. Some things had to be deduced. Nevertheless good job!

Wow, first play was outstanding!  I could definitely see this in my top 5 after a few more plays.  Every decision was tense and meaningful.  Awesome game play experience with 3.

RATING: 7
Nice enough, but for me the emphasis on repeated speculative arithmetic (the different spends you need to calculate to cover what might happen this season) and having to subvert your engine-building plans in order to meet the winter liabilities ground much of the fun out of it.  Our first 3 player game took 5 hours and that's a long time to be doing mental maths.  Particularly as you spend your spare time squinting at the task cards trying to distinguish the brown softwood sticks from the black hardwood ones.

Lignum is a deep dive exercise in planning ahead over the course of its perhaps two hour playing time.  If you enjoy studying the total game state, then taking actions that fit into your short, medium and long terms plans, then you might very well like Lignum.   

I liked Lignum on first play.  It uses the snaking worker placement mechanic that I enjoyed in the game Francis Drake, but in its own quirky thematic way, Lignum complicates the picture with loose ends, particularly on first play.  Many of the mechanics (get a sled for the winter?) felt curiously opaque on first play, but presumably, come into greater focus on future plays.

On the downside for me, Lignum's theme, running a lumber mill, felt a bit "one note" at times.  How deep do I want to dive into running a lumber mill?  And for two hours?  Nevertheless, the euro mechanics and the quest to master the euro game state, felt interesting enough to me to compensate for the theme.  

How much planning do I enjoy?  Having now played Lignum (which I might refer to in the future as "LIgnum Planning") apparently, I enjoy planning A LOT.  Bottom line:  Lignum was a curious and quirky pleasure to play.

Excellent long term planning game.  At 4, there is also a mind game of trying to determine where your opponents are going to claim for their wood cutting.  Do you risk the best region and potentially competing with, and racing, other players?  Or will you go for a less ideal spot, hoping to avoid a logjam (pun intended)?  And, if you do, will you be successful or did everyone else think the same thing?

Between the mind games and the long term planning, this is a solid and thematic medium-heavy euro.  At 2-player, the mind games are not nearly as prominent but all of the long term planning and tight resources are.

I also recommend all of the expansion content which adds more options without adding overhead.

RATING: 6
Very provisional rating.
1 hour of rules for a 1.75 hour game is a low return on time investment.
A lot of rules...fiddly...brown guys to cut wood, then purple/green guys to transport wood, then grey guys to saw wood (and cutting and sawing are different things).
After getting through rules that are more complex than it needs to be, you find out the game play is like Francis Drake and Egizia), which are more elegant. 
Lignum itself is not a bad game, but doesn't enthrall either. In this troika, Lignum has the least drafting tension, while Egizia has the most. 
Verdict is out. Really not sure of this one.

RATING: 7
Neat Euro with a very unusual theme of running a sawmill by cutting down wood and having to bring it to you mill to transform or sell it. Each season players advance their token on a Tokaido-like track where you can select as many actions as you want or skip ahead and only get a few needed actions. Makes for some interesting choices and creates very different strategies to victory. The board is a bit busy for my taste and there is a lot of information thrown at you before the first game, but it is still a solid, heavy Euro that I would like to play again. Especially with the buildings and joiners added in the second edition.

I love this game and it only gets better with each play. Yes, the game has a bit of a fiddly set-up/maintenance throughout, but is so worth this little nuance. The rondel iteration plays so strong to the games theme it is really an incredible experience before it is a classical game. Couple this with a well thought out advanced planning phase and a requirement of paying close attention to what your opponent is trying to do makes for good tension and forward thinking. There is a push/pull that is beautiful in this game. Do I cut ? Do I sell? or do I dry? Should I use my huts or sell them for precious money? Where exactly will I be in spring of year two and did I leave myself enough  time to change plans should it become necessary? This game is poetry if such ever were true of a board game. Unfortunately, because of the setup it may be hard to get to the table for some. Do not be put off by the games 4.3 Weight. It is heavy but heavy because there is so much to consider and not 'Too' much to understand regarding the interconnectivity of stuff (hope this makes sense). The rules, even in the second edition, could be better in some areas. I strongly recommend getting some condiment cups to save on the set-up/break down issue.

Enjoyed how brutal the game is, as well as, how thematic a lot of the actions are. One of my mid-heavy games if I needed something heavier than say Viticulture, but not as heavy as Vinhos. Really love it

What a great game!!! So much to consider and the amount of forward-thinking/long-term strategic planning is amazing. Really looking forward to more plays.

A really excellent, brain burning design. Everything here is so well done. The theme is fantastic. There is nothing in my collection like Lignum. It’s by far the heaviest game I own and I find myself saying, “l hate this game”, when I really love it. This game has everything. Intense planning, high player interaction and tension. Just awesome. Might be too brain burning for some people with a theme that won’t attract everyone (but I dig it).

RATING: 8.5
Lignum is a very good planing game with a lot of depth.
I love how the supply path works and that its different each season.  It can be advantageous to skip some spaces to finish early and cut wood first but you also don't want to go too fast to let your opponents grab all the stuff easily.
I also love how you have to plan one to three season ahead for the planed work.  Most of those can be very powerful if planned at the right time.

I originally taught that accomplishing the most tasks was the only way to win this game but I manage to win by selling a lot of wood and completing only 2 low scoring tasks while my opponent had done 3 high scoring one.  This really surprised me and want me to play more to see how different each plays can be.
With the available wood, tasks, buildings and planned work being random each game, it will certainly play differently every time.
I've only played at 2 player so far and its pretty good.  There's less spot available with 2 player but with 3 or 4 player, the choices on the supply path will be even more agonizing.

RATING: 8
A brain burning excercise in forward planning and optimisation to see who can run their logging business most efficiently. Variability and player interaction is cleverly built into the supply path and wood cutting mechanisms. Overall, a thoroughly engaging experience which I can see myself playing when in the mood for some heavier, economic strategising.

Nice and heavy game.  Forces you to really think out your next turn or two.  I liken it to Viticulture in that you need to plan out what to do with your workers every year, with that added twist that you need to rehire workers every turn.

Great game. Played once so far and loved the strategy of the supply path and how to distribute the wood between cutting and sawing. 
Be careful, as the "feed your people" mechanic is in effect, as well as a "keep your people warm". Food and firewood are critical. 
Look forward to playing this one again.

Lignum is a board game about the lumber industry.  Players have to cut wood, transport the wood back to their sawmill, mill the wood, fulfill contracts, and sell the wood.  This game features a small amount of simultaneous action selection for claiming lots, but it's easily mitigated for those that find themselves in a bad position.  The game centers around a path that players move their pawn down to claim various items--players can't move backwards along the path, and finishing first is rewarded by going first for wood cutting.  There are a lot of planning elements in the game, from contracts that require wood be dried for a certain number of turns, to "planned work" bonuses that can be claimed, but only for a specific future turn.  I was intrigued by the planned work idea, but found the actual bonuses to be rather limited--players can do fine even if they ignore that part of the game.  The rest of the game seems to work together fine; I was happy with the game but it didn't blow me away.

The component quality in this edition is leaps and bounds better than the original printing. Unfortunately for me, this is basically a VERY expensive expansion as I already own the original printing from Mucke Spiel.

The game is a lot thinkier than it lets on and money is super tight. This edition has you playing with the "expert" game from the get go which might be a touch much the first play. I had a few moments where I didn't plan well and had to take back a few turns to fix my downward spiral. I'd like to play it again, especially at a higher player count, but it's a solid medium-heavy euro.

I have pretty mixed feelings on this game. I enjoy planning in my game and this is ALL planning. Perhaps too much and that is a weird feeling for me. I really do like planning, but maybe I was just uninterested in the theme? This hasn't been an issue in the past for me, so I really just don't know. I had an Okay time playing it. I would even try it again, but I think it just misses something that excites me. I see why people enjoy this game but it just felt long to me and a bit boring.

[u]The positive:[/u]
:) A game in which mid to long term planning and efficiency are key. I guess that if you are looking for a challenging planning puzzle which involves some risk assessment, Lignum should easily ranks among your top choices.

:) I like the mechanic in which players take turn selecting actions on a trail on which they can only move forward. This brings special tension in the game: when you set your eye on an especially nice action laying pretty far on the track, will you skip all the other possibilities laying in between in order to secure that spot for you by arriving first? This is where the risk assessment comes in.

:) Each round the board with the action trail gets reseeded, keeping things interesting througout the game.

:) Hate it or love it, lots of people will probably not be very excited about a game about something trite as woodcutting - but all in all there is some charm in playing a demanding game about planning extremely efficiently with such a simple theme. Moreover, all in all I feel the theme is integrated rather well with the mechanics, which I always appreciate. While playing the game, at least you feel like you are running a pre-industrial era woodcutting business.

[u]The negative:[/u]
:soblue: Downtime is an issue in Lignum. This game is all about careful planning: hiring a single workforce too few might screw your plans badly, hiring one too much might cost a precious coin (which are extremely tight, especially in the first half of the game!). Moreover, you're never exactly sure which actions further down the line you will be able to snatch away, and which opponents will take. This assessment can quickly lead to some analysis paralysis which effectively shuts down the game flow for quite a while.

:soblue: There is little 'growth' in the game. Most of the time you collect stuff in order to fulfill a certain mid or long term goal (surviving winter, fulfilling contracts, optimizing wood for sales, ...), but after you have done so, you have to hand in most of your 'engine' (carts, flodder, rafts, saws, ...) and start over.

:soblue: the game is conceived as an extremely tight planning puzzle in which every detail increasing efficiency generates a marginally better outcome. ([i]for example: a basic woodblock is worth 3 coins, but is you saw it up into 4 beams {which requires a sawer and a saw - potentially costing you 2 coins worst case} it is worth 4 coins. You likely won't earn many coins this way, unless circumstances are so that you are ably to let 2 separete beams dry for half of the game, in which case you earn yourself about 10 coins (minus potential costs for sawing) vs 5 coins[/i]). The issue with this is that simply put: the game gives you the feeling that you have to work and plan really hard in order to increase your normal income with a few coins. The woodcutters business clearly is not one to become wealthy if 'Lignum' holds any truth to it :) The problem with this is that the game doesn't offer a whole lot of satisfaction for a job well done: the increased coin income are key to victory, but the results of your carefull planning work remain somewhat 'invisible' as they only render tiny income differences.
 
:soblue: As much as I appreciate the mechanic of the action trail, that much I feel the mechanic of blind bidding for one of 6 cutting areas at the beginning of each round is pointless. Yes, this blind bid creates some tension between players, but I feel this is plain gambling. 90% of the time it is clear for everybody which are the best 2 spots to take and it is impossible to tell which will end up with more or fewer players bidding on them.

:soblue: A very minor issue, but it is a shame that the game ships with slightly few comonents. Near the end of the game it is likely that in a 4 player game you will need a few replacements (or use lousy multiplier tokens).

[u]Conclusion:[/u]
Lignum is a challenging and unforgiving game about planning efficiently in an environment in which players are staring at each other in order to see who will chicken out first by jumping ahead on the action trail in order to snatch away a valuable action token, but skipping many other opportunities doing so. The game derives its charm and character mainly from this mechanic and it is one of the most distinct planning puzzles in my known boardgame universe. It would be one of my go-to games when looking for this type of challenge, but serious downtime issues coupled with a lack of growth and overall gameplay satisfaction would keep me from getting this game out more frequently.

Long and intensely boring.  The kind of game that begins and ends with a whimper.   A slog of a game that forces you to plan out moves several rounds in advance which should be rewarding,  but feels like a huge letdown after investing the time and effort into getting the timing to work properly.  The art and graphic design harken back to a day when no one cared about art and graphic design, but not in a cool old school euro way.  It's maddeningly just...blech.  The blind bidding for which area you will get to send woodcutters to is compelling, but that's it.  A hard pass.

Own two Frank Chadwick games - this and "Citadel" and both are great. Only about 10 pages of rules but lots going on and some nice chrome. Counters a mix of outlines and NATO symbols. Plays the Russian effort to take the vital rail junction of Velikyi Luki from a hotch podge of German forces. Interesting movement rules and bloody combat. Very eenly balanced game. Like "Citadel" why no remake. Bought another game on this called "Veliyke Luki" but haven't even punched yet as the rules seemed all over the place.

Designed by the great Frank Chadwick and in my opinion one of the best games ever...an elegant system that forces players into absolutely nerve-wracking decision making...both sides have limited resources to achieve victory in an environment of East Front mayhem at it's icy worst...just the right amount of chrome with a touch of exotica in it's unit mix...a favourite with me for decades.

I've played this a few times, though I don't remember if I made it to the end.  IIRC, the tanks really evaporate fast once in combat.

This was Chadwick's greatest achievement.  We played this near constantly.  The game system made the players think through fire and movement because both were driven by logistics!  It is simply a joy to play and very well balanced for both sides!  It is a 10!

It'll be awhile before I get around to playing this.  Along with all the other wargamers I know, I'm the Cecil Rhodes of wargaming:  "So much to do, so little time in which to do it."  

I bought this because of claims that this is Frank Chadwick's greatest game.  Road to the Rhine and A House Divided are both fantastic, so if this approaches those, it will be a purchase well made.

Considered very innovative when it first came out due to a high level of player interactivity and treatment of time within a game turn.  Well simulates the encirclement, siege, and relief effort for Velikiye Luki in Russia.  It takes some practice to get one's head around the movement system/sequence of play.  Once that is mastered, the game is quite intricate yet tension-filled.  There are some gamey aspects that can occasionally occur with the system but the strengths of the situation overcome that.

Played the Japanese Command Magazine version. The rules are so-so. It is not very clearly written. The impulsive movement concept was good but I think it is not streamlined enough in practice. That makes it not fun to play.

Award winning classic. This is a gunners dream game. The combat systems are based on firepower delivery (through assault or barrage). It's a total massacre; I don't know who to feel worse for, the guys rolled over by the Soviet mech corp (like erasing the 8th Pz Reg. with a 160 T-34 blitz) or the buggers pounded flat by the 7 BATTALIONS of Nebelwerfers. (like when you drive em right up to a nice strait stretch of enemy & fire 7 max. table barrages to devastate a vast swath)

You have to play the game outside ,in winter. Just to feel the cold.
Cold is the only missing feature.
Although my first game was a German disaster,I can only say that it is a fantastic game,mechanic of play is clean and play is fun!
Highly recommended

Reasonably complex but outstanding wargame for grognards. The Russian's can spend all their impulse points on the first turn, (taking the rail line for major VP's), obligating the Germans to cover the board end to end. The German player really gets the feel of being bled white as grizzled veteran infantry must stand and absorb losses while Security forces desperately plug the line elsewhere. I have never been so happy to see Luftwaffe infantry reinforcements. Later, the armies trade heavy duty punches with roaming task forces as the Germans attempt to relieve the seige. A fantastic game.

The early GDW wargame on the WWII eastern front...the first truly operational eastern front battle game to me.  I still have the game in my warehouse.  Fare well even by today's standard. 

I have read the rulebook from head to toes, including the excellent designer notes, on 28 Jun 2014 after so many years of owning the game, as preparation of a game with the Japanese edition.  A very nice operational-tactical WWII system there. We are going to play the newer Japanese edition with the same old GDW rules (I can't read Japanese anyway except Kenji of course). Some very nice features like AFV units, morale check upon losses, artillery and line of sight, bunkers, special unit capabilities, weapons abandoning, etc. organically composed to emanate the historical flavor.

Battalion level simulation of a pretty well ignored subject.  The buzz about this game when it came out was incredible.  So I bought it in the early 80s.  Still haven't played it but I recently became more interested in battalion and lower level games so I have pulled it out and expect to take a look soon.

Along with Suez 73, this is Chadwick's finest effort (and he has quite a few.) A unique system (did he design a new system for every different battle?) coupled with a challenging situation. Simply the finest from a company that was renown for great games.

This will end as a love-hate game for most I think.

I like the situation and scale (mainly battalion and regt).  The Russians should be able to gleefully maul lots of German units if you are looking for a turn-the-tables East Front game that is not at the end of the war.

I kinda like the way the movement system works.  You start a turn with 10 movement points and select how many you want to use per impulse (the Soviets by rule will use their allocation faster).  Movement rates vary per movement type (units will have one of 5-6 movement types and movement costs vary by terrain) so there is a lot of looking at the movement chart then back to the map.

I kinda like the combat system which seems a mix of fire based and odds based with the attacker barraging, the defender firing, then the attacker assaulting.  Unit strength (tracked with pollards) is multiplied by the combat factor on the back of the counter (there are factors for support, barrage, AT value, morale, regualr combat and then unit type - personnel, heavy or light weapons)..  So again - lots of looking & factoring with the added joy of counter flipping.  But in terms of losses and the slow grinding down of units, it seems to work well.  Barrages and defensive fire can be vicious.

Supply is pretty abstract as there is a need to keep an open line, but beyond that the supply rules are largely for using in combat.  You are given a limited allocation of supply at the start of a turn and each impulse you have to spend to attack (1 SP lets you assault and support with arty all you want; 2 SPs lets you assault, support, and barrage; 3 SPs lets you do everything as with 2SPs, but lets the Germans use their abundant rocket artillery).

Throw in chrome like tank fright, ski troops, and a crappy German division that can only attack with one regt per impulse and there you are!

Pretty low to moderate counter density and lots of room to maneuver on this one too.

Rules are pretty simple, but you'll really need to make a reference card as there are lots of little details and rules hidden in the rules that are key to remember and play by, but are tough to find on the fly.

Gameplay for all the factor counting and chart checking is fairly quick, but I think the game will outlast me as I'm not sure I can stand 13+ turns of it.

I have only ever watched a game, but I was spellbound by the game play, watching two of my best friends (both excellent gamers) go at each other 'hammer and tongs' for most of three hours. When I finally found a copy of the game, I snapped it up and didn't quibble about the price. Detailed and innovative mechanics, like nothing I'd seen before, a real gamers game. Typical late '70s GDW components: serviceable and clear, not flashy. Deceptively short rules book conceals a complex but workable system. Definitely not for a novice gamer.

IMO one of the best Frank Chadwick games. The combat system is top-notch and the movement system actually feels 'realistic'. 

The game setting is spectacular, but the VC are weak. Too much emphasis on the RR towns to the rear of the Germans and not enough on rescuing/supplying the trapped troops in Velikye Luki. If a single RR town is captured, the Soviet player can play a 'passing' game for all of 1 turn and basically automatically win the CG. 

Fire & Movement magazine #21 has a great article on the game, including potential German garrisons of towns west of the Lowatj River. IMO, if the garrison rule is used, the Soviet play has almost nil chance of capturing the critical RR towns.

I have posted a long and extensive AAR over on ConSimWorld covering an entire CG played on a map I made myself with the original GDW counters.

I do not like cumbersome calculations on movement and combat.
Also, due to much amount of reinforcement, this game has always very high density of units on the map.
Because of unique slice of impulses, each turn is very long.
With these factors, this game is very far from being playable.

I need to try the alternate start scenario as the game takes a bit too long.  Otherwise, a good enough time that I made charts to make gameplay a bit easier (which are available in the file section).

Wow!  Give Ben Madison big ups on this one!  The design is not original: it is unashamedly built on the [thing=26306][/thing] engine, but he took that system to a whole new level!

This game is more detailed and more complex than Vietnam, but it is not a complicated game.  However, don't even think about playing the game without [url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/674db9_a36fc5af4f1b4994aea5cc52a258f924.pdf]printing off the 2nd edition rules[/url], unless of course, you have a 2nd edition of the game.

The game is just dripping with historical chrome.  I dare say this is the most historical game on the topic.  Game play is unique in that it is a solitaire game where you play the British trying to put down a rebellion.

The game has two drawbacks: it is a long (about 4 hours) and could probably use some scenarios.  Also, the designer commentary (marked in pink boxes) offers some commentary, and some of the commentary is just wrong: not an opinion, but factually wrong.  If you don't know your American Revolution history, don't let that stop you from playing this wonderful game, but at the same time, don't let this be the influencing factor on your knowledge of history.  I would recommend checking out some books by Joseph Ellis and Gordon Wood.  But by no means should that stop you from getting this wonderful game.  The designer really nailed it in a small package.

Update: Lowered a point.  I really want to get it to the table, but 4 hours is a bit too long for the payoff.

I like the game.   I learned a lot about the American Revolutionary War.  One has to get used to having the rulebook in your hands constantly, and the game takes quite a while to play through.   I was unable to complete the one game I attempted after several hours.

It succeeds at providing its intended perspective on the Revolutionary War. You play from the perspective of the British and a sense of frustration on behalf of the British commanders comes through strongly. This frustration is due to the delayed redeploy of rebels, the supplies provided by the French, the meddling of the British Crown, and any major campaign that comes when defenses are ill-prepared. The meddling of the Crown is quite an interesting wrinkle. For example, it's clear the South is where the Brits should be building their force in the early portion of the game, but no, the Crown says you must take New England. And you can't simply ignore New England, since a major campaign will end up with the rebels overrunning a British-controlled state. Further, much of the decisions you make will be centered around the tactics of the current round, trying to mitigate the damage a major campaign can do, and hoping that the punishing CRT table doesn't wipe out your seemingly overwhelming force.

Overall, it offers an interesting perspective and provides a satisfying narrative as you play the game. Another positive is that the game is very replayable and this bumps it over a number of other chit and dice solo games, which can somewhat feel like solvable puzzles (e.g., Agricola, Master of Britain). However, despite the narrative and replayability, I'm unsure if there's enough of a pay off for the amount of time this game takes to play. The game is on the long side (definite 3.5-4 hours once you're up and running with the procedures, but longer for the first play) with fairly long procedural rounds and the oppressive march of Liberty means the Brits are very likely to receive its historical loss.

Edit, Feb. 2018: "N: The Napoleonic Wars" does feel like an improvement over my issues with this title, which centered on the round length. Further, the game play of "N: The Napoleonic Wars" does highlight this titles issue of payoff versus play time.

Feb 2015 - just playing my first game. This looks like being a great solitaire game that could well be upgraded to a 10 - watch this space.
March 2015 - now into my third game and enjoying this immensely! This is one of the best solitaire games I've played, if not the best. The historical content and the way it is integrated into the design is fantastic. The attention to detail and subtlety in the game mechanics are a joy to discover. I'm going to have to upgrade this to a 10.
I'm also enjoying using my redesigned board :)

This is probably the least scripted solo game I've played. You have great historical flavor here. You also have just enough randomness that will keep this game coming back to the table. In most solo games, I feel that once you have the system down, your ability to win or lose comes down to your luck with dice. Here, you will never have the "system" figured out where you'll always make the right moves. Those darn rebels can pop up seemingly anywhere, and simply rolling your forces down the coast to the next target area can really backfire on you. Tremendous game.

Excellent game, ONE OF THE BEST SOLITAIRE GAMES I HAVE PLAYED and I played a substantial number of them. Uses the Vietnam war solitaire system but this one is very meaty, lots of detail but still very playable and fun. Will post a review of the game soon.

This game does a great job at telling the story of the American Revolution. You play the British trying to stamp out the Revolution. The game is very procedural and play length is a little long so if you are looking for a quick solitaire game this is not it. But if you want to take an afternoon to play a rich game about the American Revolution then this is a pretty good game. And the commentary in the rule book is a real hoot.

american revolution where the player gets to be the british and the loyalists? What's not to like?

PROS: well researched. presents a [b]wonderful[/b] narrative as the game progresses. intelligent AI. charming graphic design.

NEUTRAL: highly procedural; at once this is a fun aspect of gameplay as well as a detractor from said.

CONS: difficult to achieve replaybility without human opponents, multiple and diverse scenarios, or event/special power cards.

I just didn't like the map and holding boxes thing at the time.  I'm now thinking I'll revisit this game in light of the fact that I have recently purchased N: The Napoleonic Wars, which I have rated a preliminary "8" because it seems to be a great solo experience.

I also really appreciated the little historical contexts in the rules, explaining why certain design decisions were taken. There is also a good set of design notes at the end.

[b][COLOR=#009900]Positives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]+[/b]  Theme, theme, theme.  Wow, what a great representation of the American Revolution.  I'm honestly not that well versed in the time period and events involved (despite living amongst the history most of my life), but even for my tangential knowledge, I felt like I got a lot of history and narrative out of this game.  So probably the more knowledgeable you are about the Revolution, you'll get even more from it than I did.  But I'd still recommend it for those who are not familiar and want to learn more.
[b]+[/b]  Excellent intro to longer wargames.  I call this style of game a fringe wargame.  It's a wargame at heart but without the need for military knowledge (flanking maneuvers, divisions vs brigades vs battalions, and so on).  You can follow the step by step turn structure, making more "traditional game" decisions (resource management, area control, and whatnot).  It's a good way to determine your stamina for historic themed games and long term (literally...hours) planning and decision making.
[b]+[/b]  [b]Love[/b] the counters in DToM.  These are the (soon to be previous) VPG style thick, laser-cut counters.  They feel like solid wood and are easy to move about the game board.  The stats are easy to read, and the flags add to the flavor.  I'd take these over a GMT equivalent counter any day.

[b][COLOR=#CC0000]Negatives[/COLOR][/b]
[b]-[/b]  I struggled about whether to make this a negative or a neutral because I don't think it hurts the game, but the game is long.  Like 4 to 5 hours, solid.  And I don't know that I'd recommend playing all in one sitting.  That means you'll need a place to leave the game up and go to it here and there.  I found playing two turns at a time really create the level of engagement and enjoyment that I was looking for in this game.
[b]-[/b]  Again, not sure I'm one-hundred percent behind putting this in the negative category, but the rulebook isn't the best...[i]for a non-wargamer[/i].  I have the second version of the rules, which I'm told are a big improvement over the original.  Even so, it's wargame formatted, with rules referencing other rules in other sections which reference more rules in more sections.  For those unfamiliar or lacking the experience of these styles of rulebooks, I think it's definitely a hurdle to jump.  With that being said, I feel only the section on Rebel Campaigns caused an extensive issue of understanding.  Also, there are a few exceptions and small, rarely used rules that need to be remembered, but I would say [b]Dawn of the Zeds[/b] is a much bigger culprit in this regard.  So, DToM doesn't have a bad rulebook, but it could be a struggle depending on your experience level with wargames.

[b][COLOR=#0000FF]Neutrals[/COLOR][/b]
[b]~[/b]  The map that comes with the game is...functional.  It's not overly eye-catching or interesting, but it does the job.  It's a typical quality paper map that does what it needs to but not in stylistic way.  I definitely recommend the larger, more thematic, landscape version of the [b][filepage=114358]alternate map[/filepage][/b] from the files section of the game page.
[b]~[/b]  The gameplay is very procedural and may be a turnoff for some gamers.  There are a lot of things to do each turn.  And you do them again and again and again.  For four or five hours.  At first, it may seem like the game is playing itself.  But as you get into the game and continue on from turn to turn, you see where the decision points for the player come to light.  They do matter, and they are important.  And all of that procedure surrounding those decisions are where the history being played out on the map takes place, which in turn creates new opportunities for you to consider.  But that realization may not come quickly enough for some.

Recently purchased. I have high hopes for this solo game, especially since AirJudden recommends it (and I've enjoyed all the games he's suggested thus far)

Update: I really enjoyed this game! A tad long but every moment is tense and disturbing to the British. I haven't won a game yet, since the pesky Americans pop up in a county exactly where I don't want them. The game keeps calling me back, hoping for a win. Pick this one up from White Dog Games now!!!

RATING: 7.5
Fun game. After a few plays, the different mechanics and concepts come together together nicely, going from abstract to narrative and creating a satisfying level of immersion. 

Nuances like the Benedict Arnold chit and his "contribution" to the conflict add a touch of historical chrome. The naval phase, while fairly abstract, still has a significant impact on play because it determines reinforcements to a State. I also appreciated the historical notations found throughout the manual to provide context to some of the rules.

I have limited playing time with it so far, but early impressions are that it is challenging to win (I think I'm 0-5). I've found that the phases are set up in such an order that the Continentals can get what amounts to two opportunities to throw a wrench in your plans (Place rebels phase and Rebel campaigns), which both come after the British positioning of the ground phase. Depending on the roll of the die (place rebels) or if it was a minor campaign (only one battle), you may find a rebel unexpectedly sitting in an unoccupied county at the end of the turn without an opportunity to do anything more about it. I'm sure as I go I'll pick up strategies to counter some of that, but there lies the challenge and contributes to the replayablility.  

One last thing, I would highly recommend trying Chris Dorrell's revised game map with Barry Miller's enhancements. It's well worth the download. The added geographical flavor increases the game's strategic and historical feel. I had it mounted and found it well worth the added investment.

I wish it were less abstracted. Much drier and military focused than N which makes the narrative smaller. The game is random with lots of dice rolling which seems less satisfying for tactical battles than the larger strategic battles that you roll for in N.

RATING: 5
Interesting game.  I found the rules bouncing all around.  You are reading one part of the rules and then if refers you to another part of the rules.  Why they don't just put the rules in one place that relate to each other is confusing and frustrating.  I also found some of the rules to not be well explained even with the errata (2nd edition).  But most of the rules were understandable.  There are a lot of "if this happens, then do this" type of modifications.  It adds flavor but also adds confusion and spending a lot of time looking in the book or watching the excellent video tutorial.

Aside from the rules, I found the game to quite interesting.  It was fun playing the British and not the Americans.  Being American it took a little brain adjustment but that was cool.  

The game is quite simple despite the rules.  One thing I found I didn't like in the game play was I had a massive force against one continental army and got wiped out.  Play the game and you will know what I mean.  Not fun or accurate.  That was frustrating.

The map was of poor quality, no dice but you need 3, excellent quality on the counters, and the turn track looked like something I could print with a low resolution inkjet printer, in other words really bad.  

Overall, I was not that thrilled with the game, but can see how it would be fun after days figuring out the rules and slooshing through the rules lookups with all the modifications you have to be aware of.  

Oh yeah, who designed the box?  It is too small.  For the price of the game due to the quality of the components and box, I feel it was not worth it.

I haven't learned the game yet, but a couple of early, trivial observations:

1. the material doesn't fit the box well.   It is as though I'm trying to remove 8.5x11 paper from a box that is 8.5x11 or slightly smaller.   I'm tempted to trim the materials down to, say, 8.4x10.9" so that it will not be so awkward to remove from the box.

2. I find the instructions hard to read (look at).   My best guess is that I'm having a bit of difficulty with the font type (or size).   The instructions themselves seem well-written, as far as I can tell so far.

Well, onto actually learning (and rating) the game engine....

First impressions are mostly positive - medium complexity solitaire game that is dripping in theme and history. I really like that the player is coming from the British perspective.

Play length is more than one would expect (4+ hours), but that's OK because the game is full of twists and is engaging enough. Be aware of a lot of randomness, and play is very procedural.

Check out the errata and Rebel Campaigns rewrite (essential); there are several fiddly rules too, but this is a wargame after all. 

Definitely a much better game than its parent, Vietnam Solitaire, but still needed more development and playtesting I think. 

A bit too tactical for my favorite tastes, but a solid effort nonetheless

RATING: N/A
Got the PnP version, because it looks like it is simple enough to print it out on my own, not that many components in there. First playing around with it on Vassal makes it look interesting, but a bit on the fiddly side with combat calculations. And the play time is sadly a bit on the long side, too, so I don't really know if it will hit a physical table at all. Too much competition over physical space in my "long games" section of my collection.

This is a lesson to all gamers that not all excellent games come from larger publishing houses or famous designers.  I bought Don't Tread on Me from White Dog Games, a small game publisher, because I'm a history buff and one of my favorite time periods is the American Colonial/Revolutionary War era.

In my hopes for a decently simple war game I was surprised on numerous levels.  1) It's rare a war-game of the American Revolutionary War takes the point-of-view of the British.  2) The small footprint of this game belies it's depth.  3) As long as this game takes to finish (about 3 hours, give-or-take), I never, ever grow bored with it.  4) The history poured into it's gameplay is jaw-dropping.  5) So amazed at what this game accomplished, I have become a fan of it's designer--something I rarely do.

It's price-point is very reasonable and I urge anyone who is interested in war-games or in the American Revolutionary War period to buy this game.  :)

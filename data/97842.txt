Played it a while ago, don't remember everything. The theme very actively didn't sit well with me. The reasoning as to why we are spending our riches makes little sense, even though the idea is unique. I remember balance problems. I'll give it another shot.

Excelent game. I love the inverted thought process (got to spend money instead of accumulating it)! The one who wins is the one who gets bankrupt!!! Yeah, lets get in debt!...
Just one thing missing: can't destroy the bank account buying BOARDGAMES...

Based on first play - enjoyable worker placement, but I worry that being the last player in round 1 can lead to a serious disadvantage as by the time you become the first player to choose turn order, the game is likely nearly over. Seems like it can lead to a stunted engine. It's funny and charming  (even the next day, we're joking about one guy who made restaurant reservations and had chariots taking him from room to room in his mansion), so I would certainly play it again, but I do think it isn't quite as strong as the WP games coming out now.

What a cool idea!  A solid and very thematic economic game, but in reverse.  Good one to play with the ladies, it's basically about shopping.  :)

RATING: 6
Okay, so only played this once with 3 players - really liked the theme but was a bit underwhelmed with the game play. It felt a bit fiddly and too thinky for the theme - I'd have preferred faster play with more player interaction - go to the races and steal another player's horse to add to your farm; visit another player's mansion and really go to town doing it up to get it into tip top condition with an increased value; party hard in your own house and wreck it but find that next morning (turn) you can only use one errand boy because you're hungover... So perhaps having more as a card game with less planning would bring this up to a really good game for me. Still, will give it another go to see how it gets on.

There's enough interesting bits here to keep in lively. I do enjoy the 'backwards' theme of getting rid of all your money - even though it cramps my brain at times. The production values are marvelous. It feels pretty fresh, so I give it a solid endorsement.

Juego de cartas con mecánica añadida de colocación trabajadores para planificar y seleccionar nuevas cartas. Todos empiezan con el mismo dinero. Objetivo: el primero que se lo gaste todo, dinero y propiedades, el más vividor, ganará el juego al heredar todo el resto de la fortuna de tu tío, tal y como fue su última voluntad.
1 partida a 2, y otra a 4, mejora con más jugadores, está curioso, a falta de probarlo más para valorarlo mejor.

Quite a difficult game to get your head around on the first play.  By the end of that you've a fair idea what needs to be done to win, and by the second play it's really fine.  This is quite original compared to many Euros.  It's got a counter-intuitive feel to it at first which will apeal to most people here.  It's definitely on the heavy side of medium at the very least and I'd say that you won't get many non-gamers enjoying it - it's simply too involved and has a labyrinth of decision making.
I like the art and the theme.  And although most themes are pasted on to an extent, you do get a decent flavour of what your supposed to be doing here.

RATING: 7.5
Last Will has gone down very well so far, a lot of people I've played it with have got hooked on the theme, it makes a nice change to reverse making money with spending it and it works well with me because it usually solves the runaway leader issue, you may have a house costing you a lot of money to run but eventually you've got to sell it and find other ways to spend money; so there is a fine balance between spending money from your household and from spending money on events which is normally a large ball, that seems to work for me.

I am getting a little concerned that I've won every game I've played (except the first play where I came second by a $), a lot of the cards are hard to determine their value on their first game so I need to play this with the same group a few times to get to the next level, at which point I'll probably decry that it is a luck fest (so far there seem enough combinations of cards to prevent that being a big problem)

Brewster's Millions the board game.  I have figured out how to crush this game.  May have to start giving people a leg up on me to balance this game out.

It's a good game. The theme is amusing, although it tends not to get exposed too much as I find that you look at the symbols more than focus on the art (which is amusing, by the way). Another thing is that there are way too many symbols, even more than 7 Wonders, which is kind of distracting as we need to look at the reference in the rule book a lot the first game. Still, need more plays for a more accurate feel.

A good game but... not quite for me.  Why?  Hmmm...  Hard to peg, but the different paths are either entirely card-dependent (you can't pursue path A without at least 1 of cards A, B, C) and/or 1-2 of the paths are vastly superior given the setup.  (Don't bother with properties for short money games.)  Love the concept, love the artwork, the implementation, but kind of dislike the overall effect.

RATING: 3
You could put a really nifty game in this engine, I think.  Theme & art -- great, fun, unusual.  Alas, the actual cards are 1) quite boring, with none of the _interesting_ synergy of London or Jambo and 2) some are much, much better than others, and tend to dominate.  Even at 100 length, property is often a bad idea, the moment of dumping can lock you out of a spend, and you need to be able to exit without your engine.  A shame, the concept & art are great, the worker placement part is not bad as such things go, but the cards, which are the heart of any game like this -- they just don't give it substance that's fun.  As an instance, the white deck and blue deck mostly simply work as a symbol matching "draw more to have better chance" thing, with no method for manipulation, and too few errand boys to make wilds a good option.

RATING: 7.9
A standard worker placement/card array game? Yes, same old thing. BUT, there is enough luck-of-the-draw in Last Will to transform it from the same-old to a game of risk management. AND, the bizarre (and unique) theming just makes the tired old mechanics shine: the theme, for once, suits the mechanics! It'll probably take you at least a full game to catch on to how those mechanics actually work, however.

RATING: 6
I want to like Last Will more. Maybe with repeated plays it could get more interesting. But the thing that really holds it back for me is the way AP is almost baked right into the design. Picking your plan and assigning apprentices to draft bonuses is all well and good. The theme is fun and cards are interesting. But then every player takes their whole turn one at a time--spending / activating all cards and actions they wish for the round. The pacing is stilted and tedious. And I'm not sure why, but paying rather than gaining money for all the actions just feels counter-intuitive and more time consuming than other games.

Last Will has charm when you get to play it. But there seems to be a lot of inevitable waiting around designed into the gameplay. It's not quite deep enough to justify the dense / slow decision making. Who is playing can really make a difference, though.

An nice light worker placement/hand management game with reverse economic thinking. You have to lose your money even to go into depth in order to earn the inheritance of your uncle!

At it's heart it is not much different than any other economic game, it's just that the numbers are all negative.

The only kind of efficiency game that I like; short and sharp with a real need to pay attention to what other players are up to.  It also helps that Last Will has a quite original theme.  We are competing to squander an inheritance as quickly as possible.  The Victorian toff theming is delightfully done with humorous elements and gorgeous artwork.  For a light game it offers real strategic options too.  As ever, the card icons take some getting used to, but on a scale of one to Race for the Galaxy, they're not too inscrutable.

Good card management game, light euro-game. The theme (spent your money as quickly as possible) is cool and the cute artwork really helps. The rules are simple and all of the cards have icons instead of text. Plays in about 1 hour. There is some randomness in the game but it is kept in check.

RATING: 8.5
Great game that's just too heavy for a true "gateway"... because of the many interacting systems, and the cryptic runes on a few of the cards. 

Teeny bit of "worker placement", lots of "tableau building" and action point allowance... this game has small, sweet versions of lots of Euro mechanics, fused together into a pretty (and quite flavorful) game with some really neat ideas. Adding the turn order board seems like it'd be sort of helpful for more strategic gameplay... you can spend an Errand Boy so you don't get stomped into a bad "role?" selection on an important turn.

estupendo juego de cartas, mola mucho eso de dilapidar rápidamente tu fortuna. Escala perfectamente con cualquier número de jugadores.

I love the theme (it's unique and entertaining), and I'm a fan of Shipyard by the same designer.  This game is very similar to Shipyard in that there's A LOT of components and A LOT to consider when playing the game.  This yields a very strategic game...that is susceptible to AP.  Once you figure it out, everything synchs and works well together, but I just can't get over how much is involved.  This knocks the game down a tick for me.  Don't get me wrong, I still like it.  It's just one of those games that you'll have to review lots of rules for if you don't play it regularly enough--so be advised.

Some interest, but not that much fun. There seemed to be something particularly unrewarding in the strugle to make money trickle slowly away.

Game was a little confusing on our first play. Lacked some focus as you just try to blow your money on any cards that come out. Subsequent plays have been with the Getting Sacked expansion which really helped focus what you do as you try to align your choices with the things that will get you fired and makes for a more enjoyable experience overall. Prodigals Club has essentially replaced this game for us, however, so we ended up selling this one.

[ESP] wow, un muy entretenido juego en el cual hay que intentar deshacerse lo más rápido posible del dinero que se tiene para demostrar que somos los más aptos para disfrutar la herencia del difunto tío.
Cuesta un poco pensar en reversa (gasta dinero, no lo generes) pero una vez que se toma el hilo las decisiones son mejores. En la primera partida debíamos gastar 70mill y nos costó muchísimo. En la segunda debíamos gastar 120mill e increíblemente fuimos más capaces de hacerlo ya que conociendo el juego cada uno creó su propia "maquinita para gastar" con las cartas adquiridas.

A little worker placement, a little action selection, a little timing strategy at the end of the game. Like a lot of euros for me these days, mostly feels like a rehash of stuff I've seen before.

Not too bad, and certainly a possible choice for a fast play if nothing better is available, but otherwise entirely forgettable.

Nice design.  The concept of trying to lose money is fresh and to a point interesting.  But I found it counter intuitive and left an unsatisfactory feeling.  The player going second was also able to get two 'old friends' as two came out in first round, one in second.  This skewed the game and he won comfortably.  Either all cards in 'tableau' should be unique or the old friends should be limited to one per person.  Or alternatively, turn order could be determined by the position chosen for turn order adding a fourth criteria to the mix.  It was interesting enough to play again as one would expect from CGE.  But there are a lot of games I would chose in preference.

The lesser Vlada (and this is not a critic to Suchy... it's just that the other Vlaada is among the best!) is a designer to be watched carefully: I really liked Shipyard, and I heard (almost) only praises for 20th Century!
Last Will is lighter than his previous designs, but it's deceptfully simple: going broke to win is somewhat counterintuitive, and so is building an engine only to tear it down!
There's lots of choices for such a simple game, and I particularly like the interwoven turn order / number of actions / number of errands / number of card draws tough choice.
I only played with 2 players, so the tentative rating is a 7... but I suspect it plays much better with 3 or 4 (maybe with 5 there's too much downtime / analysis paralysis...), so the rating could go up after some more plays!

There are many different strategies you can try every time you play depending on what your starting hand is, how much the target amount is and what are available on the street.  I really enjoy creating the money-burning engine and nothing beats the feeling of going bankrupt in the quickest way.

Many people say it's basically just reversing the idea of gaining VP.  However, most of my friends love the game mainly because of the well-implemented theme. Who doesn't enjoy spending money like there's no tomorrow?

First Play: Seemed a bit fiddly at the start but as soon as you get your head around the flow, this is a very tidy and strategic little game. Some opportunities for screwage but mainly a head down get on with it flavour.

It will help to know what the cards are in the deck to pre-empt certain oportunities

Second Play: Yes this is a sound addition to my collection. Lots to think about, and a need to be flexible.

A game with a whacky theme and a few interesting mechanics (the choice of initiative, aps, cards all rolled into one) but lacking in many places. There is simply not much to do here. You do some engine building, some set collection and that is all there is to it. A somewhat lost potential.

I love Last Will! It is euro game goodness. Basically, you have to lose as much money as possible. You do this by playing cards, either as 1 time actions, or that stay in front of you giving you a bonus. You can get real estate, which you let depreciate and sell at a loss, you can take you dog to dinner or your horse to the theater or your chef on a boat trip! Super fun game and really is a must own if you like light to mid-weight Euros.

I was first lured in by the art and fun theme.  The game is for sure fun to play and easy to get into, but most importantly it is a solid game.  Plenty of different strategies to explore and tough decisions to make.  The style is spot on, a beautiful game to look at.

Pretty light game of Brewster's Millions where you are trying to spend all of your money the fastest.  As it was introduced to me, you want to buy high and sell low with buildings.  This game definitely encourages specialization.

I enjoyed my 2 plays of this game.  I expected it to be enjoyable as more of a light game, but I'm finding that the rules are not easy for players to pick up.  Gamers are probably fine, but not others.

After a third play, I realize that I don't really want to play it again.  Clever idea and interesting mechanics, but it just doesn't turn out to be that interesting in the end.

Pro's:

1) Great theme, Brewster's millions the board game is a damn good idea.
2) Programming your actions to determine first pick at cards vs more action points works really well.
3) Extending from that, the flow of the game is excellent. 
4) Getting that perfect card combo is really satisfying, closest I can compare it to is if you have ever played magic the gathering and particularly enjoyed combo decks, there is a certain point that you feel like you are going to win because you just drew the perfect cards, fantastic when you pull this off.

Con's:

1) I admit I found some of the iconography confusing, even more so than my beloved Troyes.
2) I feel like, they could have gone much more outrageous in terms of your actions. For a game with such an imaginative theme, the actions you actually take feel less so.
3) Game is deceptively difficult to learn and understanding the card combos is actually quite difficult. I have seen many a player completely fail to grasp the concepts.

I appreciate any boardgame that tries to incorporate humor into it's design.  This silly game takes the idea of building an economic engine and reverses it towards the poor house.  See you start the game with a big wad of cash.  Each player needs to blow through it as fast and lavishly as possible.  If you've seen Brewster's Millions you'll understand the concept/plot of the game.  A fairly standard Worker Placement game with action points that is elevated with it's humor.  Without the humor and dumb stories this game tells I doubt I'd enjoy it very much.

With one play I really like it.  It is a money management game with the the opposite goal of the rest.  But I liked the Mad magazine game for the same reason.
It works well because you need to build your engine to spend all your money efficiently & then you need to sell your properties & get rid of that money to win.
But it can be unbalanced by turn order in the in the end but most games share that problem.

I played it 2 times, first with 5 players and then with 3. It is way too long with 5 for what it is. Both times the same player who went for only white and blue cards, no buildings, won by a landslide. This is clearly imbalanced. All card games are to a certain extent, but this game pretends to be more and so this really pisses me off. The theme seems funny at first, but it is really just pasted-on and has absolutely no connection to the mechanics. You could as well just be earning money instead of spending it.

Although I don't like the theme, the gameplay is pretty good. Bad luck when drawing random people cards and pet cards can be annoying, but it's part of the game and encourages players to plan ahead and hedge their bets by saving certain cards (although the hand limit is pretty small). Aside from competition for turn order and cards in the common area, the game feels like multiplayer solitaire... but you need to keep an eye on other players (esp. newbies) to ensure they aren't making mistakes (such as math errors or missing pre-requisites/co-requisites.

UPDATE 2012: Fun, but too much luck of the draw.  I would rather play something with more control.

A solid Euro with lots of nice mechanisms that work smoothly together. The upside-down victory conditions - trying to lose all your money - works well, and there are plenty of combos to access. How best to manipulate the housing market will take a couple of plays to perfect, but it works well. Nothing revolutionary here, but good, solid fare.

Game is awesome. So much fun. It is way much easier than "The Prodigals Club". Mechanics are the same but in this game You have only one part which is spending money etc. In "The Prodigals Club" You will find fortune, society & polictics. But You can remove fortune part from "The Prodigals Club" and add whole "Last Will" in this place! That can be awesome - two games like one huge one and I personally think these two games together can be really difficult and brain burning.

Anyway if You have to choose between these two if You are looking for the easier one You should pick "Last Will". After playing in "The Prodigals Club", "Last Will" is just easy alone.

Overall the game is great, so much fun. Theme is very strong, components are very solid. Money in this game (cardboard tiles) should be used like inspiration for other board games creators! 

I love the quality that CGE provides to players. The best ratio between price and quality in the games. 

Set up is very fast and easy to do.

Imo this thing should go but my fiance loves it.

It sort of a worker placement, sort of card combo's. It's a mix between different board games. Which is good. It's a game that you have lose your money. Get negative think how your going to spend the money the quickest to win. It's more solitaire with the only decisions is what your going to do and how much money did you spend on that turn. I actually really like it. It was a lil fiddly at first. But I think most games are like that. I waited for this and it played to my expectations. I like it. However not everyone will.Lot's of ways to win. Good news it's short 45 min to an hour. Haven't played with more than 3 though.

Todos los jugadores son sobrinos de un tío rico que ha decidido dejar toda su fortuna a quien mejor sepa gastarse el dinero. Todas las acciones del juego están encaminadas por tanto a gastarse cuanto más dinero mejor. 

En las mecánicas se incluye colocación de trabajadores, un sistema de elección de turno que determina el número de trabajadores que puedes usar, las acciones disponibles y el numero de cartas que puedes robar.

Las acciones sirven para jugar cartas, que pueden ser propiedades (mejorables), personas, eventos, etc. 

Es un juego con una mecánica sencilla, pero que da para pensar. Hay muy buenos combos con las cartas. La suerte influye en el juego, pero no demasiado (las cartas que te toquen.. pero tienes que saber adaptarte a lo que te llega).

Es entretenido, fácil y divertido de jugar.

I wanted to love this game for its theme alone. The action selection mechanism reminds me of Through the Ages, a favorite of mine, and the artwork is simply astonishing. 

Unfortunately, it fell flat for me. One reason might be that, despite the theme, this is just another efficiency engine building game, and I have grown tired of that genre. Nice game, but not great (and thus not worthy of a place in my collection).

One of those rare titles that I just didn't enjoy very much, despite being seemingly solid.  I have no knocks on the game, it just was dry and fairly samey.  The cards look cool, but really they all depict fairly similar things, and if everyone is playing well, all players will be proceeding pretty much apace.  Like Shipyard (another Czech game), this one has all the right elements to satisfy, but for some reason it doesn't.  Shipyard had a limp market element that made all those rondels less enticing to manipulate, whereas Last Will feels like Power Grid in that post-game analysis will likely not yield insights into future good play.

RATING: 6.5
A good, lighter-weight Euro with a fun theme and a counterintuitive goal: lose points as fast as possible with an inefficiency engine! It took me a little while to adjust to the notion that I was trying to be as ineffective and wasteful as possible—not an easy task when you're used to playing other efficiency Euros!

I worry that good card draws at the beginning of the game can really imbalance things: I lucked out with some very powerful mansions in my opening hand, enabling me to lose up to $15 per turn after acquiring the required companions, which I then exploited through the whole game until I finally sold the properties off. Once I hit the second half of the game, however, things got kind of boring because I was just waiting around for my properties to devalue while picking up event cards for some quick expenditures. The end result was that I won easily but didn't feel like I deserved it, having made the bulk of my points from my lucky early draws. Maybe a drafting mechanic could fix this problem?

Very impressed on first play.  The difficult choices start with the choice of orders, then allocating your messenger boys and then dealing with you choice of - never enough - actions.  The trick, as ever, is synergy bwetween your cards and actions and it looks like there are plenty of options to explore for that - though I suspect that the point at which you dispose of your propeties (which brings an influx of cash which is not a goiod thing in this game) is a crucial factor.

I love engine building games, and this seems to be a pretty great one with a lot of options for strategic planning.  Basically, what you're doing is try to build a dollar spending engine out of various cards in order to more quickly run yourself out of money before the other players.

There are several ways to do this.  Perhaps you buy some expensive properties, allowing them to waste away until they're worth squat.  Maybe you actually decide to keep up your properties, which can also cost a good chunk of change!  Perhaps you focus on expensive outings, taking women out to the opera or going on a boating trip with your dog and personal chef.  There really are a lot of options in this game, and figuring out the optimal path to blowing your cash is a lot of fun!

If you like games with an engine building element to them and enjoy figuring out effective card combos, give this one a shot!  One of my favorite games of 2011.

Engine-building Euro with one of the best themes around. Players get a small amount of money that they must spend as quickly as possible on superfluous purchases in order to inherit money from a rich uncle. The game is a ton of fun to play just to see how players try to waste their money each turn. The game is also a very basic engine-building game at its core and represents a very good introduction to this mechanism for gamers used to lighter fare. Perfect for light-to-medium gamers looking for an usually fun Euro game.

Here's a strange one. A game that frustrated me as we struggled to figure out how to play it, but in the end I hadn't fully enjoyed the experience, but knew it was a game that I wanted to own and play again with a better understanding of the rules under my belt. This is a very good game. It gets a crappy scoring from me because it needs to prove it to me. BUT I am willing to put my money were my mouth is and buy it, because this will get played again and loved.  Sept 13 Rated an 8

Solid game, gets replayability from the differing starting amounts. Highly rewards replay, has several ways to do well. I can easily dial down my play when playing new players, which makes it seven better. Initial minor concerns on the strength of Old Friend has been eleviated by more plays. 
More plays and I've bumped this up, especially with the turn order expansion.

First: DAT THEME. AWWWW YIS. 

It's crazy how much the theme of this game (and the art) elevate the experience tenfold. It really helps that the different strategical routes you can take are all themeatically connected too (like the "I'm going to throw a party EVERY DAY" route vs. the "I'm going to flip houses... the opposite way" route.) It can really feel like you're telling a little story here.

While tearing your engine down vs. building an engine up feels mostly emotionally/narratively different rather than mechanically, it really ties the game's theme to the mechanics like almost nothing else. It does so much to make this game FEEL different - even with all of the garden variety Euro mechanics at play here, Last Will only feels like a "standard" Euro if you stand back and deliberately abstract it to the furthest possible point.

And yes, mechanically, this game's got legs. Each turn presents an array of nice options and building combos is maximally fun and satisfying (and the way cards work gives it excellent replay value). And the player order system is brilliant. It helps keep the resources feeling scarce because to get something you're always giving something up in exchange. Want a lot of cards? Okay, but you won't get a lot of actions!

My one complaint? The iconography in this game is ESPECIALLY bad, due to a general lack of consistency between cards/card types. If each card had a STANDARD place where it listed a cost for playing it, cost for activating it, and benefit it would be much more digestible. As it is since I don't play this very often I spend the first several turns every game just trying to wrap my head around everything. Ugh.

Update: Years after its release, this is still one of our group's favorites. We've tired of so many worker placement / combo building / tableau games but still keep coming back to Last Will. I think it's a combination of theme and the randomization factor the cards bring, which is just the right balance of adding variety without making luck a deciding factor.

RATING: 7.5
This game surprised me; I had heard about it but thought I wouldn’t care much for it. But after having played it twice I must say that it’s a quite clever game. The theme is funny, but it’s not like it hasn’t been done before (Go For Broke). The playing time is short, though you still feel you accomplish something when you’re building your tableau. I like how the game can end in two ways but most likely will end in round 5 or 6 if playing with the standard 70 gold.  It’s very cool that you can start with more or less money which will change the strategies about which buildings to buy and how many etc. as you might play all 7 rounds before determining a winner.

It’s a card game, and as such there are some killer combos. But even if you start with one and get a headstart, you can definitely still make a comeback and make a good combo yourself. And even without a good combo it is possible to win, which I actually did in my second game in which I instead focused on manipulating the market and get a ton of extra actions.
However, speaking of extra actions, this is probably where the game disappointed me a bit. The “extra action” cards which come out in round 1 or 2 are huge no-brainers to take almost no matter what other cards are available. An extra action in each round for the rest of the game is just too powerful I think. In both of my games the winner was indeed the person who took such an action card as his first action…

Still, the game was overall very enjoyable and I would gladly play it again. Hopefully I am going to try it with 5 players to see what impact it has on the game. The different combos and the animal cards you can use for extra money and how you can let your buildings become dilapidated were all nice touches to the game.

Cool game with a cool theme. I like spending as much as possible on a turn, it really is a change from the usual, and the game plays surprisingly quick. I would of liked a little more variety in spending money because there are a lot of similarities between cards and a lot of similar ways to spend. Overall, I like it and want to play again.

Fantastic worker placement/card collection game combinations out there.  Lots of planning required to play it properly, and everything seems nicely balanced and nuanced.

I lose every time I play, but that's okay - it's still incredibly fun.  I would consider this one of Suchy's best designs (although [gameid=55600] is a great design as well).

Not bad. I was intrigued by the theme of this game. Regarding the actual game play, I enjoyed it, but it didn't knock my socks off.

Surprisingly, the "spend your money as quickly as you can" didn't feel as unique as I expected. Really, you're simply tossing back VPs instead of collecting them, but you're still looking for cards and combos that have some synergy, similar to other card tableau games. I did like how buildings can be money pits, but this didn't wow me with anything unique.

I'd play it again, but I'm not in a rush to own it.

Tentative rating after 2 plays. A little mind bendy, which is a good thing. How is it possible that a game about winning by spending all your money can be balanced when players have random amounts of starting cash?!? Well, it somehow seems to work. There's a ton of luck in the card draw, so it needs to be played in a lighthearted way (which seems to match the theme) or it will probably fall flat.

RATING: 3
An annoying growth game whose claim to fame is to lose money instead of gaining it. Which in gaming terms, as already noticed by others, is exactly the same thing but then with opposite signs and different words to describe the associated actions. But hey, gaming is supposed to be about [i]fun[/i], not manipulating mechanisms, so the game is [i]majorly different[/i], right? I call BS on that one—obviously.

I found the game itself to be unfun, to be honest. First of all there is luck of the draw. A well-timed banquet costing a small fortune can make or break your chance at winning the game, for example. But there are also helpers, companions, etcetera, which [i]just happen[/i] to make things easier if you keep on getting them in the right combination. And unfortunately there is no way to control that apart from drawing cards... but you pay by not taking actions. Second is the rule that you cannot go into debt while still owning property. So here we have a mechanism which allows you to sink money into it at a predictable rate, but you have to sell the property at some point. Problem: once you sell the property, your money spending engine is [i]gone[/i], and you have to make do with the banquets and trips again, and thus compete with the players who were also using banquets and trips to get rid of their money, thus exacerbating the luck of the draw-effect. If only because they had more turns to get synergy between helpers and white cards going. Weeeee... Finally the game dictates what you do when by indicating which cards are turned up at every round. Deviate from this path at your own peril. Or, in different words, the game tells you how it wants to be played, which makes me wonder why [i]I[/i] need to play it in the first place.

For a game which is about spending money the most, there's a remarkable amount of friction in what you think you can do and what you actually can do. And the reason is game balance due to random inputs. This is a stupid design decision. Not again therefore, and fortunately the game's owner agrees.

This game has been great for expanding our gaming repertoire with other gateway'd gamers. We've played it with 3 friends and all have enjoyed it. I originally thought it would fade after 6-8 games, but this seems to have more staying power than initial play would indicate.

The theme of this game alone is hilarious.  You play as a nephew to a rich uncle.  The uncle wants to ensure that his money will not go to waste, so will write into the will the nephew who will blow the given amount of money first.  Most games teaches you to hold onto money.  In this game the objective is to be a frivolous as possible and spend, spend, spend!  There are some really neat combinations that you can create with the cards in this game.  I thoroughly enjoy it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Throwing the usual style of play on its head, in Last Will players are trying to spend all their money as quickly as possible.  The challenge is there are only so many hours in the day, represented by actions.  So you must acquire the right combination of actions and spending opportunities to go bankrupt first.

Rounds begin with players selecting a spot with a set number of cards to draw, actions to receive, and gopher boys to grab cards or other items to help you out.  Then it's up to you to use cards to buy things like a nice dinner or a night at the opera.  There is also a unique property system where you try to buy houses, let them depreciate, and then sell at a lower price.

There is a lot to think about in this game, and so it's not good for the AP-prone. But I really liked it and feel it's unique with mechanisms that feel fresh.  Family-friendly and looks to adapt easily for 2 - 5 players (but it feels tight with 5).  Definitely a winner from the latest crop of Essen games.

Components: Fun artwork; attractive boards. The iconography on the backs of the cards doesn't convey the purpose of each deck.

Experience: Great theme. I liked “Brewster's Millions” as a kid, and this is basically the board game version.

In practice, though, it's just a worker placement game + efficiency engine. It's not different enough (in terms of what part of my brain it scratches) from its peers to make me want to play it again.

Not a lot of new stuff here, but it works well and is nevertheless a fun game. Backwards from most Euros, as you are trying to spend your money wantonly and *not* make a profit in order to win. 

There is tension in shortage of actions as well as being blocked from some action spaces. You'll not be able to do everything you would like to do. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Pros:

- Great theme for a euro. Would be interesting to see it modernized. A race to lose money to win is a fun twist on the usual.

- Neat art, good quality components/cards.

- Doesn't take too long to play, mid-length game for a mid-weight game.

Cons:

- Interaction mainly revolves around choosing turn order and drafting cards from the board before others get a chance versus choosing a spot that allows for more actions or card draw. Normally this would be an interesting tough choice but to play and pay for cards, you basically need a balance of action count and cards to make the most of each round.

- Strategies and therefore replayability seem limited as some cards lose you a lot more money than others for the action cost.

Can't comment on how the expansion may improve this game, but the "sequel" of sorts Prodigal's Club amps this game's theme up in a new package. Unable to compare the two at the moment.

This game is a lot of fun. It has pretty solid mechanisms and a very fun theme. While losing money rather than gaining money is a simple inversion for scoring, it does make it fun to tell the story of your escapades each time you take a turn. We like it at two player and it is still good at 4. We tried it once at 5 players and it bogged down a little bit at that player count.

Last Will's mechanics are very good and the theme is great.

There's a lot more game packed into this one than I was expecting. Turns out it's a moderate Euro. You enlist the help of various assistants and purchase various buildings in order to try to become bankrupt faster than anyone else.

After just a couple games, I was concerned about whether or not there would be too much randomness due getting very good card draws (or very bad ones), but I've decide the randomness isn't really as significant as I first thought.

I've noticed some people saying that the theme could be replaced with "try to gain 70 victory points" rather than "try to spend $70"... however, it's a bit more complicated than that. On your final turn, you cannot declare bankruptcy if you still own property, and you cannot spend more money than your cash on hand. Poor planning can lead to a situation where you'd like to activate a property then sell it off, but because you don't have enough cash on hand to activate the property one last time, you're forced to just sell the property. Since some properties can be activated for a lot of money, not planning how and when you'll go bankrupt can decide the game. (It took me several games to realize the importance of this... and how this situation really wouldn't make sense with a different theme.)

1) gevraagde kaarten worden open op het aanbodbord gelegd


2) spelers plaatsen hun actiefiche op het spelersbord op één van de zandlopers. Deze plaats zal diverse zaken gaan bepalen; het aantal kaarten dat je mag trekken, het aantal boodschappers dat je mag inzetten, het aantal acties dat je hebt in de actiefase en de volgorde waarin je zal spelen.


3) om beurten zetten de spelers hun boodschappers één voor één in volgens speelvolgorde. Sommige spelers zullen één, anderen twee boodschappers mogen inzetten. Je kan ervoor opteren om een kaart aan te schaffen, een extra aanbodbord aan te kopen, de prijzen van het vastgoed aan te passen, een kaart te trekken en naar de opera gaan waar je 2 geld spendeert


4) je mag een aantal actiepunten gebruiken (naar gelang je planning in fase 2), hiermee activeer je kaarten. Sommige kaarten vragen één of meerdere actiepunten, anderen zelfs geen. Al deze kaarten zullen je geld doen spenderen. Het is natuurlijk aan jou om het meeste geld met zo weinig mogelijk actiepunten te spenderen.


5) je mag slechts 2 handkaarten houden, alles klaarzetten voor de volgende ronde.

De speler met het meeste schulden (of het minste geld) is de winnaar.

De kaarten : er zijn witte en zwarte kaarten. De witte kaarten worden uit de hand gespeeld, uitgevoerd (dwz geld spenderen) en nadien afgelegd. De zwarte kaarten daarentegen moeten op je eigen spelersbord worden gelegd en kunnen elke ronde opnieuw geactiveerd worden. Op de kaarten staat steeds afgebeeld hoeveel actiepunten je moet inleveren om ze te mogen spelen of activeren en hoeveel geld het je kost.

* Someone who has played it before has a huge advantage over someone who hasn't.
* The first player to get the right combination of cards will likely win the game.

I don't find this as startling a new idea as other people have said, but it's a good game. The initial order selection (with it's impacts on card draws, number of workers and action points) is nicely thought through and there is definitely depth in getting complementry card types together as well as how to drive the last few bits of wealth out. Players want to do everything at once but are very limited. Good stuff.

RATING: 7
It's all about the card synergies --- not my favorite style of eurogame --- and you won't know what roughly half the cards do until after you select them. I think of it as a lighter, funner version of pret-a-porter: lots of cards to examine, many of which you'll keep to re-activate from round to round. The theme is interesting, and adopting the mindset to squander money instead of acquiring it is not at all difficult; in fact, the game's structure pretty much compels that approach.

Nothing offensive about this game - I'd certainly play it if it was out and there weren't other games I liked better going on.  But nothing about it particularly grabs me, either.  I'm still at the mercy of card draws, as shown when I took a six card draw action twice in a game and did not get the companion I wanted.  That's unfun.  The ending is also a bit anti-climactic, as it's fairly clear who is in the running and who isn't for the last few turns.

Played this 2-player.  It was a learning experience, and it took time working things out.  The rulebook isn't very clear.  (Some better picture examples would work wonders.) By the end of the game, we sort of had it figured out.  This whole idea of trying to lose money is fun, but the confusing iconography and the poor explanations in the rule book drain the fun out of it. I'd really like to try this one again with more players, but I doubt that it's going to happen.

Players are racing to be the first to spend an allowance, proving they know best how to enjoy their rich relatives inheritance. Amusing card game set in Victorian England, where players acquire cards, then take actions using them to best spend their stipend as quickly as possible.  Cards are either instant events, or ongoing expenses which sit on the table.  Personality cards chain on, and other cards power up existing cards, allowing the cash to go faster.  Nice, simple game where you are trying to get a good synergy of cards going, and the spending rather than earning theming gives the game a comedic twist.  Four plays in, like it a lot.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I'm having a harder time that usual making up my mind about LAST WILL after 2 plays.  I do really like the theme, and I applaud the myriad of different paths available to lose money, such as buying, depreciating, and selling properties; keeping up with a bevy of expensive companions and clubs; running your farms; blowing large sums on one-shot events.  

To make these paths work optimally, you need to get the right helper cards.  Because the game is so tight, it can be very painful if you are unable to nab the cards you need, and maybe that's where my frustration comes with this game.

It is par for the course in worker placement games that someone else grabs the spot you need; that's the whole tension of the game.  However, when your spot is taken, there needs to be something else you can do instead.  While Last Will offers you other options, they likely will not be nearly as good.  The 2-card limit at the end of each turn exacerbates this quite a bit as you can't really make up for a missed beat this turn on the next turn.  

Overall, this is a nicely designed, easy to play Euro.  Usually, when I find myself ambivalent about a game, I'm thinking "I would rather be playing X".  But with Last Will, an X doesn't come to mind.  That's commendable, because I don't play a whole lot of new games anymore that don't feel like something I have already played.  But I don't love it.  More plays will help me make up my mind one way or the other.  I think the game will either open up for me as I gain a greater appreciation for its depths, or I'll become more convinced of its lack of replayability.  

Sept 2012:
Played again, this time starting with $120.  I now understand that you need to adjust your strategy to the amount of money in the game.  This adds some interesting game-to-game variation.  I would play this anytime, but I am still not convinced of its long term replayability.  And yet I keep wanting to play it....

December 2012
My tumultuous relationship with this game continues. I really want to like this game, and I am playing it quite a bit, and yet I still find it vaguely unsatisfying. I think I may just like my worker placement/engine games either heavier or lighter than this.  Regardless, I have ordered the expansion in the hope it will add that missing something.   I realize that this is akin to having a child to try to save your marriage, but I am going to give it a shot.

November 2014
The expansion adds some nice variety, options, and decisions, but does not fundamentally change the game.  I do like playing this, but my vague dissatisfaction at game end persists.  I think that I'm craving a little more depth and strategic variance than this game was designed to offer.  This game perfectly meets my personal definition of a "7": very good game, happy to play it, but don't need to own.  I will even break my "no fractions" policy and give this one a 7.5 :)

RATING: 8
The best thing about it is the theme.  Props for something different.  The mechanisms are all things that you have seen before:  card drafting via worker placement, turn order manipulation (sort of like Fresco - thanks, Bruce), and engine building.   Primarily engine building, actually.  You need to find the best way to get extra actions and more card combos in play than your opponents, so that you can lose money the fastest.  The concept is novel, even if the mechanisms aren't.   Fast play and excellent art are two bonuses as well.

I enjoy worker placement games, and this is one of my favorites in my collection.  The theme and artwork is really appealing to me, and I just like how the mechanics work.  I doubt I would ever get rid of this game. 11/1/16: Downgraded from 9.5 to 8.5. Not the hotness anymore, and trying to realign all my scores.  8.5 makes more sense to me.

RATING: 7
After 1 play: I was a little skeptical about the strategy and depth with this game due to the amount of card draws in the game. But because there are was to draw more, you end up drawing so many cards each turn I didn't feel locked out of options, or feel like someone just drew better. But probably the most redeeming quality of the game after 1 play, is that there does seem to be multiple strategies (houses, events, chaining expenses, etc) that can be explored in future plays. 

The iconography and mechanics of the game make it a bit tough for an game for new players, so I dont consider this a good game to bring to family events to teach family members, but a good choice for more experienced or interested players.

Interesting little game that proves to be somewhat counter-intuitive for long-time gamers in the fact that you are actively trying to spend money, not earn it. While some may struggle at this adjustment in thinking, it's not a great leap. There is a pretty decent element of luck to it in the card draws, this is somewhat exacerbated by the amount of cards you elect to draw when you're selecting turn order (general rule is more cards, fewer actions, but greater selection and vice versa).

One of the important things in this game is the narrative.  Trying to justify taking your horse to dinner, for example, lends a lot more flavor to the game than simply playing with the mechanics.  At our table, we insisted on telling stories for the cards we were playing which made the game a lot more interesting and entertaining than it is designed to be and in-line with the light humor of the game, we never played the cards straight.  That is to say, playing a horse with a dinner card obviously is meant to say you rode the horse to a dinner event, but in our little stories, we actually made it so that you're actually courting your horse.  It's the little things.

Mechanically, the game is a simple worker placement with action selection as the main piece of work.  In this way, you can consider this a euro, and like most euros, you need to come up with a plan and stick to it if you're going to make any headway in the scoring department (remember, you want to bankrupt yourself).  Such as it is, players need to be familiar with what they can expect from each deck as it will help formulate their long-term plan.  Do you grab all the farms you can and the related expenses that allow you to populate them with horses and dogs for low cost?  Or do you buy up all the mansions you can as early as possible and depreciate them with bonus abilities?  Or, like one player, do you build nothing but a fleet of carriages and spend your entire fortune simply clip-clopping around town?

Initial rating of 7 as I would definitely play it again, but more plays might lower the score as it seems there may be an element of old-hat that may become apparent over time.

The game fails to keep my attention...It's a light card/tableau building game with a bulky feeling setup.  It doesn't have the smooth back and forth play I enjoy in a good card game, nor does it seem to have the layers of depth I look for in a good board game. 

I really don't know how to explain my ambivalence towards Last Will in a helpful manner other than to say that once you get past the unique theme, the game doesn't feel very interactive, the actions aren't very interesting, the combos aren't that satisfying, the strategies don't feel particularly difficult to execute, and the game phases feel clunky. 

Also, the thing that makes spending money so fun and satisfying (in games and life) is that you have to work for it to reap the rewards, but in Last Will it's all just dumped on you at the very beginning.  The game is missing a key part of the equation, and the game just ends up feeling meaningless as you have no hand in amassing the fortune you end up wasting on real estate, services, and companions.

It's one of those games that feels like it should be easier to teach and play than it really is, which is interesting because that pretty much sums up my feelings about all the CGE games I've played.

confusing mess that better development would have made easier to play and teach... an iconography nightmare that makes RftG childs play... what ever happened to using words to describe what a card does.

and really, the setting of losing money is just the same old economic game, where the system is just reversed. it easily could be reversed into a game of earning money and it likely was developed this way.

Players race to lose their fortunes - basically a reverse tableau builder. Acquire cards that help you spend your money. Declare bankruptcy and win! There's a neat trick with ownership of property which can help you lose money but needs to be left alone to decrease in value for an eventual sale. The game feels really chaotic to me, with every player announcing some combination of buying and selling and abilities and ... I just get a bit lost. Generally good fun though, just need to play it more.

New and interesting theme. I like how the different mechanisms in the game (cards, action point allowance, worker placement) work together beautifully. I also like that you do not have control over everything that happens in the game and that you just have to make the best of what you have. But in the end it still comes down to  skill instead of luck and those games are always my favourite :-)

"Last Will, the latest game of Czech designer Vladimir Suchy, is card driven hand management game, where the players try to spend as much money as they can instead of gaining as much as possible. Your rich uncle is dead and you can only inherit if you prove that you can enjoy a decadent life."

Worker placement game where the aim is to SPEND as much money as possible.   Lighter style game, quite a strong game - the concept of the winner being the player who has spent the most is really a neat idea! (not sure on the hedonism in the game though). Very fun theme (strengthened by great artwork on cards) and fun to play!  Scales well from 2-4 players.  Can be played in an hour.  Probably one step above gate-way games.

RATING: 4
An amusing theme, but unfortunately the game does not live up to it; in fact, it runs counter. In a game about going wild spending sprees, it takes the fun away by only allowing very small steps while holding you back in just about every way. The problem stems from a) having too few actions and b) being allowed to retain too few cards. You get all these cards but you don't have the actions to use many at all, and you can only hold two at the end of the turn. [i]Look at all this stuff you won't be able to use! Isn't that fun? [/i] No, it’s not. 

And getting card combinations to match up with such a limited hand size is more rare than common. One turn my cards matched and I was able to take a horse to the theatre. That was fun. That’s exactly what this game should be about to let the theme shine through, and it should make it easier for me to do that as the game goes on, not once in a blue moon. The sparsity in what the game allows you to do contrasts with the "go on a crazy spending spree" theme. The final nail in the coffin was my poor draw of Companion cards which only once matched up with what I needed. The result is a lot of wasted card draws that end up being discarded and create a sense of frustration instead of accomplishment. In short: more wackiness (ie, powerful card combos), not less, is what this game needs.

As to the worker placement, the ideas sound fun but in practice we’d frequently look at the board and see no fun and interesting options, just crappy or mediocre ones. The result was a feeling of being generally frustrated and uninspired. I was bored mid-way through the game and have no interest in exploring the game any further. I realize that these games all have artificial constraints to some extent or another and that's the point here too; what can you do given these sets of constraints? My response: not enough to make the experience interesting.

Fun and light, with a nice amount of indirect screwage. Blowing cash as opposed to hording is a novel approach. I need to play it more because I made some bad investments that made money (ugh).

Buying property that devalues a lot seems ideal over property with spending actions.

Wonderfully silly take on a reverse engine builder.  Spend your way into debt, but watch out because as you settle up at the end you're also removing your costs.

I highly recommend you play the longer version of the game, with more money, rather than the short version.  With less money you never feel like your engine actually 'hits' before you start disassembling it.

Played at BayCon 2012.

Enjoyed this one and only lost due to tie-breakers. 

Buying property is a quick way to lose all your money but then you have to sell up which can give you quite a bit back. 

I refused to buy property (thus ignoring an aspects of the game) and instead focussed on using events and days out to drop my cash.

Old friends that give you an additional action are a little bit busted especially if you get them first turn as they effectively negate the penalty for going first.

Initial impressions after two plays are that I really like this game.  I do wonder how it would fare long term in terms of re-playability when the best card combinations have been worked out? 
Obviously the player can only choose the cards that are available but I can immediately see after only two plays that some combinations seem powerful such as farms/training grounds/steward.  Perhaps with a few more plays I'll see there are many more routes to victory...

What's the difference between spending money and earning money? Using Last Will as exhibit A, the correct answer can only be: There is no difference but the sign.

Once you've realized that Last Will is a very pedestrian combo-building game. There is a number of different cards you can use to build your engine but most of them are very similar to each other. The marginal differences might be put to good use when creating your engine except that there is little to no control over what cards you actually get. Card draws are largely random, and since there are tight limits on what you can play and how many cards you can keep in any given round you might luck into some nice synergy or you might not.

Spending a lot of money has never been so... ordinary.

After second play I'm impressed how many decisions are packed into a game that is so short!
I olike it. Not shure about it's longlivity but I'm shure I'll try several pathways to see if they work.

EDIT
Wow! The 3rd game REALLY clicked. We played to 100,000 pounds. The game was longer - we finished on 7th day and was extremely engaging and finish was nails-biting. My restaurant empire (every day I have spent >17,000 pounds on restaurants with only single action :))
Really like it. Rating increased to 8.5.

EDIT 2:
After few more plays the game seem to cover up all the things it could. It's not like I won't play it. But usually the game is set up for the end about Thursday, and there's almost no spins since the middle game.
Need to play it again with an expansion and see what do I think now.
Rating lowered to 7.

There are two minor wrinkles here: one, your victory points are negative instead of positive (and lowest score wins), and two, you're going to build an engine then dismantle it, as getting to bankruptcy effectively requires properties with expenses, and then sale of said properties.  The balance isn't particularly good, and having several decks of cards is somewhat bloated in terms of design.  The turn order mechanism was a missed opportunity in the opinion of the group I played it with, because it was almost a certainty that you would take the first position as start player --could have been much more interesting tension there, and there are games that use that mechanism much better.

That said, if I wanted a light Euro with a bit of chaos/imbalance to accommodate gateway players, this is a decent choice, and easily jumps a couple points in rating for that crowd.  If you like deeper games, this is pretty meh as there just isn't enough nuance or elegance to rise above average.

An okay game but It make itself a lot more complicated than it really is by having an icon for everything. This made it very hard for my so to grasp and I felt a little let down when the game was over because it didn't feel as clever as it tries to be.

Well constructed worker placement/hand management game, lifted above the pack with an interesting theme and lovely illustrations.  The choice between more actions vs turn order and getting a good choice of things to action is very well done.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A very clever worker placement game allowing you to build some nice combinations of related actions - players must first decide the number of actions they will have for the turn balancing actions, turn order (which gives first access to the best visible cards - cards give benefits to help you spend your loot faster) and number of cards to blind draw. The objective is to spend a starting balance of cash which fits into the theme (have you seen Brewster's Millions?). The mechanics are just like any other resource accummulation game - the most efficient engine wins - but they have nuild in the potential for some nice combinations. Player interaction is minimal with just some potential blocking. Components are very good. Good game.

RATING: 7
Themed a bit like the old "Go for Broke" game from the 1960s (70s?) or "brewster's millions."  It is a fun themed worker placement game that gets finished in around an hour so I didn't get tired of the game before it ended.

RATING: 8
Seven plays: once with three, four times with four, and twice with five. A good strategy-exploration-type game, by which I mean that it's a game for which part of the fun is learning the subtleties of the game and developing strategies over the course of several plays. Last Will usually manages to do this without bogging down or causing analysis-paralysis, which is a nice achievement. The theme is also novel and fairly well integrated.

Strategy-wise, getting to know the decks is important, as well as learning to think in terms of benefit per action point. It's a good idea to get some helpers out early and milk them for all they're worth, and don't underestimate the value of churning through the event and companion decks. 

The down side, and what keeps it from graduating from "really really good" to "great", is that it's complicated, or at least to my taste. It's a pain in the neck to teach, and newbies are going to spend their first game just trying to grasp the mechanisms and remember all the interactions between the cards. [b]If you're only going to play it once, don't bother.[/b] I'll also mention that the playing time printed on the box is very optimistic if you're playing with a larger group. 75 minutes for five players? Fat chance, unless everyone has ten games under their belt.

RATING: 7
Last Will is a card/worker placement game for 2 to 5 player in which you have to spend all or the most money.
I like the planning phase in which you select your turn order for the next phases, the number of cards you draw, the number of worker you'll place and the number of actions you'll have.
With more cards, you'll have more choices.
With your workers you can :
- access to more powerful cards
- rearrange the value of the properties
- take a board extension (to place more cards)
- spend money
With your actions you can play an event, place a card on your board or activate them to spend your money.
The winner of the game is the player who spend the most money (or got into debt) after having sold all his properties.

Provisional rating based on one two-player game.  The game is very thematic with lots of options to choose to spend your money.  The artwork on the cards is beautiful.  The player interactions and screw age factor aren't particularly high which isn't a bad thing for those whose gaming partners don't like direct confrontation much.  I can't wait to try this one out again.

Couldn't quite convince myself the 'money losing' mechanic was any different from normal money-gaining mechanics, except in thematic terms.

Or that it was okay even if it was intentional.

Just another thematically-quirky mechanically-bland euro to go alongside Drum Roll.

RATING: 7
Last Will is an wonderfully light and thematic economic game where every goal is the opposite of what is standard. The goal is to be the first to spend all your money, and the engines each player builds is a means to spend their money the fastest. More than its mechanics, adding to your engine tells a story. The fun is building a tableau that allows you to take a pet or date or chef or maybe a horse to the theater each week. Little stories evolve throughout the game. Mechanically, the most interesting decision revolves around properties. A property costs quite a bit of money to maintain, but you have to sell it before a player goes bankrupt. When to make the decision to sell is important and will likely determine victory. Last Will is relaxing, a great play, and unique.

„Gémakarat”
A játék témája azonnal magára vonta érdeklődésemet. Végre nem pénzt, győzelmi pontot kell gyűjteni, hanem költeni kell, de azt hatékonyan.
Gazdag nagybácsink ránk hagyná vagyonát, ha bebizonyítjuk, hogy egy kis részéből mi képesek vagyunk az életet habos tortaként behabzsolni. Bárcsak a való életben is ilyen történne velem.
Ennek megfelelően már nagy kedvvel tudtam ehhez a játékhoz leülni. A kártyák, játéktáblák, jelzők minősége jó; az előkészítés is egy ilyen nehézségű játékhoz mérten gyors.
Ami még tetszett, hogy a játékban alapvetően összesen 7 kör van, de ha valamelyik játékos sikeresen eléri célját, azaz elkölti a pénzét, akkor abban a körben már véget is ér a játék.
Minden körben felpakoljuk a játéktáblára az éppen aktuálisan elérhető kártyákat, majd a játékosok következik a tervezés fázisa, ami meghatározza a körsorrendet, a felhúzható kártyák számát (ezeket azonnal megkapod), a rendelkezésedre álló küldöncök és akciók számát (ez a már jól ismert melyik ujjamat harapjam rész: kellene ez is, az is, de mindent nem lehet).
Majd következik a küldöncök lehelyezése, amellyel a táblán található lehetőségeket tudsz igénybe venni. Mindezek után végrehajtod akcióidat.
A küldöncök biztosította lehetőségek és az akcióid kombinációjával tudsz pénzt költeni. Ingatlant veszel, segítőket alkalmazol, társakkal vagy nélkülük különböző eseményeken veszel részt, …
A játékban meglévő egyik kis csavar, hogy az ingatlanokkal hatékonyabban tudod vagyonkádat költeni, viszont, amíg van házad/farmod, nem tudsz csődbe menni, így azt majd el is kell adnod.
A játékban található speciális kártyák a meglévő alaplapok turbósított verziói, amelyek a körök előrehaladtával kerülnek játékba és értékességüknél fogva kiemelt célpontjai játékosainknak.
A játéktábla kialakításánál a szerző arra is figyelt, hogy játékosszámtól függően más-más táblák álljanak rendelkezésre, így 2-5 személlyel is jól játszható a társas.
Sok szöveggel nem találkozol, a játék szimbólumokat alkalmaz. Ennek nagy előnye, hogy jól átlátható a játék, bár a szimbólumok elsajátítása időbe telhet. A kártyákból sincs sok típus, így ez is kedvez a minél gyorsabb szabálymagyarázatnak és a játék elsajátításának.
Kis negatívumként jelent meg, hogy az előkészítés során (minden játékos 3 ingatlant és 3 kiadás/segítő lapot kap, amelyből 2-őt megtarthat) a jó lapjárás miatt megszerzett lapok (például 2 jó segítő, 1 jó segítő és 1 jó ingatlan) már a játék elején előnyt jelenthetnek. Nem vészes, később kompenzálható, de létezik. Illetve több játék után már sok újdonságot nem mutat. Ezen a kiegészítő biztosan segít.
Kellemes játékot ismertem meg, amellyel kezdőket is meg lehet indítani a „lejtőn” a komolyabb társasok felé. Ehhez az érdekes témához, történethez a szerző korrekt játékot tett le az asztalara, kipróbálása ajánlott.

In my two plays to date I like it a lot. We played to two different amounts in each game and the different amounts really messed with the end game, in a good way. You need to play differently in the shorter game than in the longer game.

Within my top 5 of all time. Truly a thematic Eurogame! It's comedy the way that you are actively seeking to lose money. So strategic yet wonderfully tactical within the card drawing and worker placement. I love how this game mixes many genres/mechanics yet does it with amazing elegance. Worker placement, tableau building, action point allowance, card drafting, turn order track, money management,and market management all in one package that feels complete. Plays best IMHO with 2 players and the expansion adds a ton of what we already love about it. This game belongs in everyone's collection! Get on it and take your dog to dinner, let your house run down, make a deal with a "dirty old friend", buy high and sell low. This game is a gem.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: cada jugador representa un nebot de una persona rica que acaba de morir i que deixarà la seva herencia al nebot que es quedi en bancarrota abans. El joc es tracta de ser el primer en quedarse sense diners. Cada ronda els jugadors escolleixen l'ordre de torn en un track, que a la vegada determinarà el nombre de cartes que agafen i les accions que tenen. Les cartes tenen un cost per jugarles i cada torn les pots fer servir gastant accions per gastar més diners.

És un joc de cartes en el fons, es tracta de buscar combos entre les cartes perque gastin la major quantitat de diners cada ronda. Molt poca interacció, segurament pecarà de jugar un sol sense mirar els taulells de la resta...

A solid but uninspiring worker placement / hand management game.  The "lose X points to win" mechanic is only innovative if you are too stupid to realize its the same thing as "gain X points to win."  People are commenting like this is an innovative mechanic...  it is not, its just a clever use of theme.  Using one worker placement track for number of cards drawn, turn order, actions given, and workers to place is sort of a neat idea, although the novelty wears off after a turn or two.  The depreciating properties that you sell back are another good idea, and the timing of returning them is probably one of the most interesting things in the game.  Its a well balanced game, several of us new players were within a few dollars of each other with two of us going bankrupt the same turn while another player had one dollar.  Someone who played before won, but only by six dollars.  The balance is pretty exceptional when you consider all the moving parts. Overall this is a solid, but not great, game.  There isn't really enough interaction other than "I took it first" type of stuff, despite there being ample opportunities to do so, like markets, or cards that give or take from others.  If it was longer than an hour or any more complicated than it is, I would not have liked it, but the time frame, simplicity, and good scalability probably make up for its flaws.  Solid game.

There used to be an old game at my great-grandma's house called Go For Broke. It was basically the opposite of Monopoly, trying to lose all your money. Others may recall the 80's movie Brewster's Millions when the hear the premise. Regardless, it's a fun concept and tends to immediately hook people in.

The way to go about losing your vast fortune is generally by investing in real estate and then devaluing the market (or not doing proper maintenance on your properties). You can also buy fancy dinners and other extravagant items, but these are usually less effective. This is a worker placement game with only a couple workers. You will often even sacrifice placing them to draw more cards or do other things. Ultimately, the first player to have no assets at all will be the winner (so all properties must be sold and the profits spent eventually). 

The board can look a bit daunting at first. In fact, the setup is at least slightly different with every number of players the game supports. The artwork is a nice mixture of snobbishness and humor that works well for the theme and the components are of good quality.

I enjoy this game, even though mechanically it doesn't really break new ground. The simple reversal of trying to spend money instead of getting rich just seems to change the mindset enough that the game just seems to work. Definitely worth a try.

Another forgettable worker placement thing. Even with only 2 workers to place, I felt like there weren't enough interesting choices. The main appeal here is in discovering the special combos that get lots of points, but there's a lot of chaff in the four or five card decks you can choose from. You will have no chance if you don't get those extra action cards early. The idea of winning by going bankrupt is kind of fun I guess. Overall, nothing here deserving of repeat play.

Last Will is a thinky engine building game, with some min-max flavour, some luck as to when cards come available, and a perverse funny theme.

Unfortunately, I find the min-max action analysis detracts from the thematic flavour- too much thinking for a light hearted frivolous money squandering game.

It's not bad at all, but a simpler mechanic that was a better fit with the theme would make a huge difference in the play experience.

After playing this once with 5 people I can say it takes about as long to explain as it does to play, but that's a good thing. It's not that long of a game, and it has some fun and interesting choices to be made each round. It plays at just the right length to not outstay its welcome, but long enough to develop a strategy. Also, 3 out of the 5 players satisfied the win condition, and the tie breaker rules had to come into effect. This was very satisfying because it meant the final rounds were tense in a good way.

Oddly, it reminded me of 7 Wonders.

RATING: 6.5
The mechanic for working out turn order is fantastic. The idea of getting rid of all your money is fantastic. The way how you need to buy/sell properties to achieve this is also great.

Unfortunately I dislike the fact that there are 5 different piles of where the cards come from yet with no discernible strategy to be gained by going for one over the other (it still comes mainly down to luck of the draw).

I also dislike that some of the cards which are lucky how they come out are almost auto wins!!

My final gripe is the balls. They aren't smoothly diminishing returns or increasing... it's just the first guest gets you 2, the next gets you 3, the next gets you 2, the next is 5, the next is 3 then 7. It's all over the place and that messes with my mathematical/economist brain in a way I don't like.

Overall it's good without being amazing.

RATING: 2
(03/2012) This game seems like a lot of work to keep mildly entertained for a hour, with all the bits and pieces. For a filler, it is 30 minutes past its welcome. At the end of the game, what have I accomplished? What have I gained? Oh yeah, "I lost all of my money." It's an interesting game where you're trying to be as inefficient as possible, which is in sharp contrast to most Eurogames emphasizing efficiency. There are tons of cards with varying effects and rates of inefficiency that need to be evaluated, but one has to go through a convoluted worker-placement, turn-order mechanic to get the cards and the associated actions to play those cards. Novel, yes, but in the end it feels very linear, with some player interaction, progressing top-down like a flow chart, much like Through the Ages and Dungeon Lords, two designs I intensely dislike. The motivation is briefly humorous, like the movie Brewster's Millions, but then later I have to ask myself: "Why do I care?"--I don't. Initial rating '5'.

Update (02/10/13): After contemplating about this for nearly a year, I have no desire to ever play this again. With so many better games out there now, Last Will was nothing more than a flash in the pan--no one talks about it anymore. Downrating to a '2'.

It is good game for two and we enjoy it, with fun theme and great artwork. There are some opportunities to laugh, and the artwork does a great job to draw up the theme and suggest humorous situations. That said, Last Will is, in my opinion, perhaps not at its best with 2 and benefits from increased interaction of 3 or 4.

UPDATE: The artwork and humour of this game are excellent, but the gameplay and mechanics are a bit dry. I sort of wish I would like this game more solely because of its art.

Interesting game where you need to spend and waste the largest amount of money in the shortest time. Nice idea, funny pictures but the feeling is better suited for a fast card game than for a 1 hour (or more) board game with cards...

RATING: 7
A pretty optimization game of using limited cards, turn order, messenger boys and actions to spend money as fast as you can.  There is some interaction.  You can speed the game up by doing all actions simultaneously, but that makes it feel more like solitaire.

One of the few games I played back to back. Really interesting theme. The mechanics work well to support the theme throughout the entire game.

RATING: 7
A fun little inverse engine game where the idea is to destroy your position as quickly as possible. As with other games of this type the luck of the draw can be massive. If a good card comes into the tableau when you're first to play, you're quids in (or out in this case) and with scoring likely to be tight it can be game deciding. There's also no catch up mechanism to rein in early leaders. The theme is fun, though. I love the idea of taking your horse to the theatre, I hope you're just riding there and back, not putting him in the seat next to yours and paying someone to sweep up the poop. Unfortunately the iconography on the cards is far from clear, you'll constantly be seeking clarification throughout the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is such a charming game. I mean, the goofy theme is a lot of fun and adds a lot to the game, but there's also a little bit of card drafting--which I love--and a little bit of engine building, but with flexibility. It's a card game in its heart, and I really like that about it.  I think this one will have some staying power.  

(Oddly, it seems that Suchy alternates between making games that leave me nonplussed--League of Six, 20th Century--and games of which I am very fond--Shipyard and Last Will.  Shipyard's still my favorite of his, but LW also makes me happy.)

Fun worker placement game with an entertaining theme.  Unfortunately, that theme gets lost a bit during the game as you min/max like any other worker placement game.  Icons take a bit of getting used to.  Plays pretty fast.

Simpatica l'idea che si vinca non arricchendosi, ma spendendo tutto ciò che si possiede all'inizio. Per il resto è un gioco abbastanza freddo, in cui l'obbiettivo è quello di combinare meccanicamente le azioni, in modo da ottenere le combo più potenti.

A very good euro game with an interesting twist, lose all your money. A lot of people think that will be very easy to do but, oh no it isn't. Part of the game is having to buy properties and when to let them go,because of course when you sell, you get money. This game plays quite well for two players and is definitely one that will stay in my collection.

The idea of game is very nice. The exhaustion of property is the goal of the game. Even though the idea is refreshing and creative so much, the game mechanic is nothing more than ordinary. The game is mainly influenced by luck. Last Will is good for someone who love theme so much, but is not suitable for someone who want to enjoy tactical choices. The time span of the game is quite long. The game takes about 2 to 3 hours with 4 players. It was not my cup of tea.

A game in which you're supposed to spend all the money you have right from the start. For a Eurogamer, I can't see something funnier than that. The CGE guys are really good at deconstructing our old and dusty habits of gathering the more money we can... and push us in the opposite direction.

If you have ever seen the move Brewster's Millions this is like that but on a board game. I love the theme and flow of the game. Its a nice change of pace that you are trying to get rid of money instead of obtain more. The game is actually very quick to play. I think the first time I played it was about an hour for 4 people. The second time was about 25-30 minutes with 3 people (2 of which had played before). The art work is also really well done. I have no complaints about this game and cannot wait to play it again.

Very climatic and nice.
Perfect ratio of decision-making/optimization (quite much) to playing time (~1h).

The theme is great too and playing the game is just fun.

--

Player Order Board ('expansion') looks harmful to the game - I'm definitely going to avoid it...

EDIT: After 15+ plays the game has completely worn out for me...  'Getting Sacked' expansion was not able to save it.  Here they go for sale.

EDIT2: 'Prodigals Club' didn't save it either.  'Last Will' as a module was the weakest mode of PC (too much fuss for too little return).

Sold.

RATING: 7
Extra points for the theme, trying to lose money and go bankrupt instead of always the opposite, but overall it felt like another fairly generic WP engine game otherwise, where I think luck was a just a touch high (note length is good and in check with it though, so almost forgivable). Note though another nice aspect was the fact that you needed to time the destruction of your "engine" (go broke engine) here, since they are worth money so you need to devalue or sell them and timing is everything. 

If I play again and luck bothers me I'll likely lower this to 6 or 6.5. Worst offender seemed like initial hand if someone got extra actions or placements, these should probably be taken out of the initial deal otherwise someone gains a fair size advantage especially if others don't come out that soon. Also turn order due to getting the same kinds of things before others. Note I played with the expansion which did add a couple nice things like needed to get fired from a job, so yet another thing to destruct but not sure it is worth the price.

RATING: 6.5
Other than the theme and one really interesting mechanism this is a pretty generic worker placement game. The one interesting thing is the way you determine the turn order each round. The earlier you want to go the fewer things you'll get, but beyond that the different spots actually have different pros and cons, where some might have more card draw before the round starts but fewer action points at the end of the round. Or sometimes you might end up with fewer workers for the round than everybody else. So it is really nice how you have to figure out what you need this round and also how important it is to go earlier. Other than this though it just comes down to a standard worker placement game where it's first to so many dollars (really first to spend so many dollars in a Brewster's Millions-esque scenario, but it's completely equivalent).

The worker placement spots mostly just have cards in them with various ways to spend money either in one time bursts or slowly every turn. And they need to be comboed together effectively, though it's pretty obvious what combos with what. Then the action points are spent playing and activating the cards that reduce your money. This aspect to the game is all very straightforward. If the theme appeals to you however this might be a bit higher as the cards are largely pretty charming.

Very impressed with this one, it's a very interesting theme with suprisingly deep strategy options.  There are several strategies to go for, each plays differently depending on which cards you draw.

Played a 2 player game once and didn't like the blocking that occurred at the beginning, so I left it on my shelf for a while. Then I played a 3 player game and had an awesome time. Not unlike Seasons, it keeps getting trumped by new games, but only in situations with more than 2 players.

Edit: After having played it again, I'm realizing that it's quite fiddly and difficult to explain to new players for this reason. The icons don't translate well and so we always have to have the rule book right beside us. The theme is great and I will continue to play it, but I'm not as impressed as I would like to be by it.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (October 2012)

I had huge hopes for this one, but it disappointed me a bit as I though the game was better :S.

I love the theme and the art and components are gorgeous. I also love the backstory (you need to enjoy your life). Last Will theme is different than anything I have played and spend money is so utterly backwards you need some time to adjust to the new mechanic, however I´m concerned about the luck factor of the game. It seemed the luck of the draw was pretty high (most of all in the companion deck). I feel that it was mostly luck what decided our game. 

I love worker placement games and I like that aspect of this one, but I dislike that you can draw so many cards from the common decks, I feel this somehow limit the importance of the errand boys as you can get almost anything in the planning phase.

About the errand boys, you have only 2 pawns AT MOST per turn and it seemed this would create a tense atmosphere but it doesn’t, in my game I found that you only need 1 errand boy, the other is nice to have but not critical to play as there are very few cards that complement your engine.

On the plus side, the game plays quickly and I like the Last Will cards that modifies how much money players start with. This can make the game feel different each play which is a HUGE plus.

It is an ok game but the luck factor bothers me, I would play again if requested but I won’t actively pursue more plays of Last Will.

A fun premise for a game.  Underneath is a tableau building game reminiscent of London, with a worker placement phase to gather resources for building and implementing the tableau.

I'd like to play a few more times with variable starting conditions to see what there is here.  In particular other gamers I've talked to have had concerns that properties were underpowered because of the difficulty involved in switching engines after the property is sold off.

What am i missing? "Winning by losing all your money is so different...". No: putting a negative in front of VPs  doesn't make this game any different in feel from the usual WP fare. Cheap gimmick. I hated all the icons, took away the fun.  I did laugh at some of the cards (eg. have a big party depreciates your mansion value), and jokes about "female companions, dogs, and chefs" of the companion deck. But in the end, too many rules, not enough game to make it a keeper. Everyone else seemed to love it, though. There's something missing compared to simlar games like Ra that are just tighter.

It is an original and enjoyable game of trying to get rid of your money. You try to build up the best spending economy. A good deal of money can be lost through properties.

Last Will is as processional and workman-like as all other Suchy titles so far. It's his take on worker placement and players have to go through the motions repeatedly (qed). Here, they build up their little engine to spend money the fastest but there's no reason that would hinder retheming the game exactly the opposite. There's also no single original feature that would at least partly redeem the repetitive and slightly boring gameplay.
20th Century remains the only Suchy game that works for me as I like auction and tile-laying games. Fans of worker placement seem to be more prevalent given the higher rating of Last Will here on BGG.

RATING: 4
After 1 play with 3 players, merely OK. It appears to me that the extra action cards are overpowered.  The game was over in 6 rounds and took about an hour (the other 2 players had played before).  There were never any extra action cards available to me the entire game.

Rating of 6 is tentative.  I could really see this rating going down to 5 or 4 if I had another play like the first.

Edit: Second play went just like the first, except I was the guy that managed to get the extra actions.  I won, beating 2 more experienced players.  Rating lowered to 4.

I really enjoy this game. 3 is probably the best number, but I'll need to see. With some people, it can drag a bit, but I'd love to play this game with people that are comfortable with the rules and can start taking actions simultaneously. That may make my score jump a lot higher.

I'm not fond of the theme, but it's somehow quite relaxing to build an engine with the goal of losing money in mind for once. The game also looks awesomely good and plays really quickly. A really strategic game where your choices are to big extent dictated by the cards in your opening hand. In the beginning it feels like you should have more hats and actions available, but the hats aren't that must in the end and there are quite a lot of free actions available which renders this problem meaningless.

Just when I was getting super sick of worker placement games, I watched a runthrough for this game and was instantly hooked. I aboslutely love it! Funny, quirky theme, challenging, but not too challenging.

The get-rid-of-all-your-money-theme is usually funny but mostly accompanied by a pretty bad game. Luckily, that is not the case here. The theme is funny and nicely implemented and the game is absolutely solid. Both things combined make for a very enjoyable gaming experience.

Purchased via Geeklist auction, February 2012. 

I saw this in prototype at the UK games Expo. It didn't grab me, in fact I was really put off by it. Fast forward a few months and I see a video of it on BGG and decide to give it a whirl. 


First play interesting, second play, just wasn't working for me. Once i took away the extra interest of discovering the game first play it was just not for me.

A bit lighter than I'd prefer in a worker placement game. The bulk of it is fairly simple card play. If you go in hoping for a mid-weight Euro, you'll probably find it too airy. Still, the mechanics are sound, the theme is charming, and the production value is decent.

Fantastic.  I love this theme, and the small twist it gives to Euro games.  Instead of agonizing over gaining more resources, you are dumping them as quickly as possible.  While fundamentally you are still just pushing cubes in the most efficient way possible, this still feels much different.

"The board game 'Life', but in reverse" was how it was explained to me. I think it plays good at 3, but find it lacking when it comes to two players. Part of the worker placement that I like about it is blocking other players, which doesn't do a whole lot since there are a few good spaces to go to.

2013-May-12: First game, took a bit to learn despite having read the rules a few times. The rules are excellent but I'm terrible at explaining a game I haven't played, so that slowed the first few rounds. Quite enjoyed it, very much liked the theme and reverse economic engine. Looking forward to the next play.

Fun theme and good looking, functional components. That isn't enough though, since Last Will is almost total solitaire game that differs surprisingly little from economic snowball games which are all the rage currently (amusingly enough it seems that gamewise it doesn't make much of a difference whether you are trying to gather or spend money).

RATING: 7
Very clever little game. I like the mid to early 19th century setting, but would've probably appealed to a wider audience if it had a more modern setting. Fun to try to spend money hand-over-fist instead of make it.

A little longer and more involved for the theme and perceived "lightness" of the game, but still fun.

Last Will is an absolutely amazing game with a unique theme tied to it. Trying to lose all your money instead of gaining more takes a bit of getting used to, but that's what makes this game so awesome. 
I've played this game over 6 times now, and I love it just as much now as when I first started played it.

My only complaint is that some of the symbols on the cards aren't totally self-explanatory and I have to keep the "symbol identification page" within reach at all times.

Played once, 3p.  Pretty good set collection/resource management game.  You have to collect sets to manage your resources, so they two main mechanics rely on each other.  The goal is to get rid of as much of your starting resource as possible.  There is also card drafting and hand management.  Nicely unique use of the theme and mechanics.

Fairly fast and relatively simple, with no randomness and support for 5 players.  There's a worker placement component in there, but the game is really about building and running a victory point engine more efficiently than other players.  Theme wise, it's Brewster's Millions made into a board game.  It's fun to be spending all that money and really mixes things up on the cognitive level.  (Downrated a little after a while: too pure, it's only about 1 thing: building and running an engine.)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's an engine construct game.  Basically build a combination of cards that allow you to lose your money (which is the theme and goal of the game).  I personally wanted more on this theme, which reminded me of the movie Brewster's Millions, but it's a typical Euro game.

Oddball game in which the goal is to lose all your money, so "buy high and sell low" becomes a strategy. And there are multiple strategies.

Ultimately it's not that different from a standard economic engine game, but it shakes things up enough to stand out.

Last Will is a tableau building game with the central action selection mechanism found in Pergammon, though a bit different in its implementation.

The stress of the simple turn order mechanism is amazing and is scaled incredibly well based on number of players. I also find it fascinating that a game with so much randomness doesn't feel random at all, and indeed you can mitigate most of the luck in such a way as to make your endgame feel well planned and structured. I think the timing decisions are the biggest challenge and will take the longest to learn. I also love that your tableau size is limited and that in just 8 rounds you have to sacrifice to expand it; and this is also a gamble.

In all I love it and finally have felt like my skill is "decent" after 4 plays.

I played this for the first time at a games day hosted by a vendor, and immediately bought a copy. Though it's not a particularly original theme (see "Brewster's Millions"), it's still unique among any games that I've played. The theme is also executed very will, with plenty of flavour text in the rulebook, and great artwork on the board and cards.

Of course, take away the theme, and this is really just a game about optimization. Losing money could just as easily be gaining money, and we've seen plenty of games which do that. Luckily, Last Will manages to do this kind of gameplay well. There's multiple paths to victory, and importantly, the variable starting amount forces players to re-think their strategy each game; strategies that work for a quick win with $70 starting money will just fizzle in a $130 game, and visa versa.

Originality of the theme gets a 10/10 from me. Once you have learned the meaning of al the icons that are used on the cards, this game plays really fast.

It is a bit of a solitary game though. You play cards for yourself. It's not much fun to follow the others doing that. So everybody is focussed on his own play. Interaction is limited to planning and card fetching. 

After 7 plays, it is still not clear to me what strategy to use when. It seems I always play pretty shallow and often that is enough to win. I wonder if there really is a strategy to this game.

Minus: 3 (rather solitaire game) - 10

"Last Will" is a very good example of how to blend a lot of mechanics and deliver a solid game. It is fairly easy to explain it, plays fast so no-one gets bored despite the little interaction, and it has great art and a very pleasant vintage style production.

Nevertheless has nothing new to offer - the whole concept is a reverse economic engine. Some cards are stronger than others, so some strategies are obvious, although I have to admit I did not explore everything.

Overall, a good game.

On the other hand, as a family game it certainly deserves an [b][size=11]"8"[/size][/b].

As an introductory economic game for kids (ages 7-11), "Last Will" undoubtedly deserves a [b][size=13]"10"[/size][/b]

(3/17) 4. I feel confident that this game is probably better than the rating I gave it and I really like the "reverse" win condition where you need to spend all your money instead of accumulate it.  That "buy high, sell low" mentality sure takes some getting used to!  That said, the iconography on this game is a killer and really, really slowed things down.  Also, I didn't find the worker placement options themselves too interesting.  I'd be willing to give it another shot, but there are so many other great worker placement games out there.

I wanted this to be a light, fun euro with a nice twist on the traditional gain/expansion goal, and it's exactly that. The theme is carried through brilliantly in the artwork, and the mechanics further reinforce it -- for example, in our first game one player bought a mansion and trashed it by throwing a wild party there in the same turn.

There's a LOT going on here, and while it took us a while to get up to speed on the rules (though they're not complex, there are a lot of little pieces) and into the swing of it, I can see game two being a lot quicker. Once you've seen the iconography in action once, it just clicks and makes sense from there on out.

The amount of options every turn is staggering, though not overwhelming because of the way phase order reduces your available options. For the number of options, AP was relatively low. I also really liked that all four of us finished reasonably close to winning, but that the winner was clearly the player who played the best.

Overall, this is a fantastic game.

Good game and fun to play. But it sits in a wierd place for me. The game actually feels really light when it comes to decision making but the rules are fairly complex. And it doesn't seem really intuitive. It is not a game you can quickly teach and then play. So you have to have a game group that really likes it and wants to play it.

As a spendthrift, this games makes a lot of sense to me! It's a lot of fun, surprisingly thematic and has quality production value. 

Update 12/14/14: 

Amazing! I didn't remember enjoying this game quite as much the first time, but that is most likely because I simply have not played it in almost a year. This game is fantastic. It's one of those medium weight games which prove that fun and thinky don't have to be mutually exclusive. I have not played it enough to know for sure, but based on my plays so far, it seems like there are SEVERAL paths to victory. I like how the money cards add variability, making each game a different length and feel depending on how much money you start with. I want to brag about the components again. They are simply cardboard and wood, but they are really nice and the art on the cards is excellent and thematic. I do wish the companion tokens were a little cooler, but that's a small gripe, and they can be upgraded easily. I LOVE how well this plays with 2. In fact, that's the only number I have played it with. The iconography in this game is the biggest hurdle. It's done well, but there's a lot of it. I don't think it's a good gateway game, but it's an excellent gamer's game, if you want something that can be played in 90 minutes or less and packs quite a punch.

Last will is one of my favorite themes out there, the theme is what drew me to the game. I really loved this game the first few plays and then the more i played it I started to see its flaws. There is a lot of fun decision and some strategic tactics. My main gripe is the luck of the card draw. There are a few cards that if you get them it will be hard for your opponents to win. Overall it's a great theme and has a lot of character. It's a fun game, some people will love it and some will hate it. If you can try before you buy you should

I love this game for its funny theme, however it is .... spoiled with clockwise movement of first player. I've lost the game because in the last round I happened to be the last and didn't have any impact on this. I needed 4 actions to complete last turn and win the game but predecessors have already taken all suitable opportunities. Thus instead of having -6 (first position) I finished with +9 (3rd).

I've ranked 9 in advance because I believe that mini-expansion "Player order board" will repair this defect. If not, the rank will be anyway 7. This is the kind of game where victory is less important than fun. My favourite event is mega party that ruins the house :-)

After 1 painful play:

This is a game best taught by others, and not self taught from the rule book.  The theme is reasonbly whimsical (reminds me of Brewster's Millions movie).  However, it belies the complexity of the choices invovled.  A steep learning curve, but could have some worthwhile long term play.

Unfortunately I expect I wont be willing to invest the time in the short term.  Could well up my rating with more plays, but not willing to spend the time to refamiliarise myself with it (and that is a bad sign).

I like this game despite some drawbacks. It feels like a light, quick game, but the iconography and synergy of the cards will take a few plays to master. The speed at which you can spend money really depends a bit on the luck of the draw. Also, it is more of a card game than a board game. Despite these things that usually drive me crazy in other games, it is a quite fun game. It take a bit to learn, but still fast paced, which is great. It has a fun theme and wonderful components and placement on the board is tight. The theme is really what makes this game better than average.

RATING: 3
10/16/12 Played a three-player game. I found Last Will hard to grasp due to the heavy use of unintuitive icons. It also has a *huge* luck of the draw factor. There are a few very good cards and a great many mediocre and poor ones. Most of the cards I saw were of no help at all. Several times I laid my entire hand down and had the owner look it over, and she'd have to admit many times, yes, there was nothing "good" I could do. That's quite galling when the first three turns I was drawing 2-3 times as many cards as the others. Even the seven or so face up cards on the board each turn almost never worked with the cards in my hand, so it made no difference if I got to them first or not. Hence I relegated myself to playing third on the first five (of six) turns. I felt virtually every turn I took was near useless. Especially when I saw others making hay by doing crazy things like taking their horse to the theater, or their dog to dinner. I gave up caring at that point. It was all too silly.  

There is virtually no player interaction; its multiplayer solitaire.  On the positive side the theme is rare (spending your money as inefficiently as possible) and the artwork is nice. But that's cold comfort. The mental gymnastics one has to go though to plan a turn is often ultimately tiring and frustrating unless one is lucky enough to draw the few good cards. I hope to never see Last Will again.

This is an interesting worker placement game with a unique and quirky theme. You have been given a lump sum of money from your late uncle, and whoever manages to spend the money the fastest, proving they can enjoy the wealth the most will be the one to inherit the rest.

Each round of the game, you work to try and spend as much money you can, be it buying up properties at a high price and then let its value degrade before selling it at a loss, spending the money on upkeep, on buying luxury items, doing lavish events, inviting old friends to help you spend your fortune.

It's definitely fun and definitely different, and I'm very interested to see how the expansion changes things up. Thumbs up.

This was a fun game.  I haven't played a game where one tries to lose all his money since [thing=1604][/thing]. Where Last Will really stands out is in the planning phase. It's here where you make the tough decision that will determine turn order, determine the number of cards and actions you'll have on the turn. The more you want the later you'll go in the round -- and this is a drafting / worker placement game! I also enjoyed how the purchasing works -- you buy cards that you hope will bankrupt you.  You also want to buy cards that work together in order to an even larger mess of your estate.

2016-08-13: Solid worker placement (WP) game with a Brewster's Millions theme (you've received an inheritance: the only catch, you must spend it all, within a month!)

Rather than getting the most money, the goal of Last Will is to finish with the least money. You'll spend money on parties, helpers (who help you spend more money), and property, in hopes of their value depreciating.

The usual WP elements are here -- getting extra workers, claiming player order (which also confers bonuses, depending on position chosen, similar to Viticulture). The single frustrating element is the random card draws. Some activities require paying of resources, but the resources are randomly drawn from the deck. This can make for very frustrating rounds where the necessary card/resource just refuses to appear.

I have no qualms with the variability of the game, based on available markets, but the amount of "luck" of matching your needs isn't suited for my taste in games.

The premise of this game is a bit misleading - you are trying to bankrupt yourself as quickly as possible.  However, you really don't get close to going bankrupt and it is more of a 'reverse point scoring system

That said, I really liked this as a worker placement game with an interesting, humorous theme (if you can imagine all the things actually occurring as you play your cards)

Not a whole lot of strategy to the game though, as it really boils down to getting the most actions as you can, and getting the right errands.  Luck of the draw and jostling for turn order position play a big part in how well you do, but preparing for combos seems to be where the strategy is at

All in all, a fun game and one that I hope to get some more plays out of (despite my group not really enjoying the first game)

I don't think I ever expected that this game would end up in the "Previously Owned" section of my profile.  From the moment I read about it, I coveted it and I thought the "Brewster's Millions" aspect of trying to LOSE money by the end of the game was unique.  Unfortunatly, the mask was pulled off when a gaming friend of mine argued that losing as much money/VPs as one could was simply the reverse of gaining as much money/VPs as one could and nothing more.  I suddenly realized that the game was just a typical economic engine-building game, only turned upside down and when that reality hit, so did the realization that there wasn't much special to the design after all.  And with that, a dearth of future plays and a one-way ticket to the sell pile.

Simply horrible. I somehow found it slightly clever or amusing for about twenty minutes, and then it completely wore off as the true nature of the game was revealed. This is YET ANOTHER game in which you place your workers here and there to get this and that symbol/card/action/resource/benefit that you can use later to convert some other [insert same list] into something else. The "twist" here is that you're trying to "get rid" of your wealth, but this is functionally the same as racing to a set number of Victory Points. There's very little arc to the game; I found myself doing pretty much the same thing over and over again, and it seemed the same with the other players. The only difference was that my repetitive "thing" was simply to activate a couple cards to burn some big chunks of cash, while others were fiddling with "Okay, first I'll use an action to get another action, then I'll use that second action to get three more actions, then I'll..." endless chain of actions to do pretty much the same thing as I did. Naturally, these more complicated engines built up more steam as the game wore on, only encouraging further downtime and fiddliness on future plays. This might be tolerable as a meaty filler, but the lengthy setup pretty much kills that possibility right off the bat. No need to ever play this one again.

RATING: 8.5
It's a great game, like it a lot... a great and original theme.

It's not the gateway game it could have been to attract non-gamers because of the iconography on the cards that causes the players to be constantly checking the last page of the manual to remember and understand the effects of cards...

For experienced players it's a light game, a fun game.

Highly recommended

This was the Gungahlin Library boardgame meet-up 'game of the month'. I played with one semi-expwrienced player and two other novices. Like Kingdom Builder we came away saying things like 'Not bad. Not great, but not bad either' or 'Yup, that was a boardgame. A few clever mechanics, winners and losers and a board. A boardgame for sure'.

I didn't much connect with the theme in my first play.  It felt one dimensional: like I was doing only 1 thing that one thing was math!

Instead, each turn limits you and leaves you with few choices.

RATING: 5
Neutral feeling about this one: it's a bit counter-intuitive to spend actions for WASTING money, but it's the entire point of this game (and its very clever twist).
Still I feel that the game is a bit random, with many decks with wild effect swings: you may be lucky to draw "spend 1 action to perform 3 actions" and do a winning combo...or not. I'd rather see specific decks with specific, controlled effects - maybe with less symbols (Race for the Galaxy kinda). 
Yet there are many ways to achieve victory and it's a good race in 3-4 players with an original theme; but it's not my kind of game.

While I admit the game description "be the first to spend all your money" sounds awesome and original, this particular execution of the idea soon gets into luck-driven tedium. The choice of actions is too limited, player interaction close to zero, your combos heavily dependent on lucky draws and the graphics is clunky and, to say the truth, pretty ugly.
If you want a good variable worker-placement euro with small interaction, but big effectiveness-competition, get Agricola.

A meaty and interesting game with a theme which is nicely brought to life by the cards.  The constantly changing choices and some counter-intuitive ideas make for an intriguing challenge.  Plenty of chances to plan ahead, but you will also need to be able to change tack on the fly.  This one is likely to rise in rating as we get more plays out of it.

I found this to be an 'iconography' game.  If you are playing with folks that cannot keep the meaning of a symbol in their heads for more than thirty seconds, you probably want something else.  I enjoyed it a lot, but I had read the rules, so maybe that makes a difference.

Light worker placement game. Theme: you receive an inheritance and must spend it the fastest. Although abstract, its fun and lets some unique innovative game aspects to be played. Not a very deep game and fairly light on strategy (medium level of decisions to make). This leaves the game in a filler category and its a bit long for that. Feels like it needs to be quicker or have more strategy.

Another dully monotonous game that proves the dead staleness of the euro genre nowadays. It's just another action selection multiplayer solitaire clone. There is nothing remotely new here, not to mention different. It claims the theme to be getting rid of your assets but it is, in fact, exactly like any other profit making game only with a negative sign. Takes absolute ages to play, downtime between turns is a killer.

Even if, in the entire world, this game is the LAST WILL I never play it again.

It works but there's something about it all that makes me think less of it while it's on the shelf.

I like Legacy: The Testament of Duke de Crecy more in the noble theme category, so maybe there's no room for this one anymore.

It didn't help that Last Will's expansion is thematically dissonant and costs a pretty penny for what it brings to the table. 

Not a bad game, but it just doesn't appeal to me anymore for some reason or the other.

Last Will is unique in being a Resource MIS-management game, where your goal is to go bankrupt as fast as possible. While this sounds like a humorous premise, the designer pissed away the opportunity by using nothing more than pedestrian, unimaginative expenditures. 

The main problem is the draw decks don't do enough to support the game's ridiculous theme. I'm sure anyone could easily think of a dozen hilarious ways to offload cash, none of which are in this game. Instead, events like having Dinner or a Soirée, or going on a Boat Trip are the showcased. Now that's thinking outside the box!

LW isn't a bad game, but its inversion of convention isn't anything that sets this game apart from its contemporaries. Its lack of laughs is a real letdown. If LW gets any future reprints, I hope some imaginative changes are made.

This is a great game where you are trying to spend all the money your grandfather gives you so that he knows that you can enjoy the rest of his money properly.

Yes, the theme is great, but a lot of people also have been saying that you take away the theme it really is a game about 'making money'.  While this is true, I really could care less because the many different ways that you can spend your money are fun and inventive.  The different kinds of cards and their interaction is where I really enjoyed this game.  To buy a house or not, which characters' long term ability do I play, how many cards do I need this turn.

I enjoyed this game very much, a fine addition to the 'monetary games' genre.

Brewster's Millions, The Boardgame.  For reals, all it's missing is John Candy.

It seems a little... tight.  Like, "the only thing that differentiates players is who gets the "extra action" guy FIRST" tight.  Its saving grace is that its intentions are crystal-clear: race to burn your cash.  Otherwise, it's another medium-weight Euro in a world filled with medium-weight Euros.

---Preliminary thoughts---

-> Great theme, really original, unique, and very, very funny.
-> Good art and components.
-> The game is very solid, with plenty of options and decisions.
-> Card drafting, worker placement game with some semi-original mechanics (nothing revolutionary, but it doens't feel like any other game)
-> Plays fast for a eurogame.

* Great impressions confirmed after first play: I increase rating to 8.5 (might decrease if the possible issues become real issues).

Possible issues?
-> The first players get a great advantage if they can get the cards that allow extra actions.
-> Balance issue: the events should be more powerful (maybe there are combos to make up for that?)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First impression (5 players): Must admit that there is extra point in rating just because of a refreshing theme. After playing gazillion of "build engine & gain most money" games it is fun for a while to aim for a fast bankruptcy. There is plenty of luck of draw with cards but for such a light game it doesn't matter that much. My only bigger complain would be player order/actions selection system. I really would like to know how they came up with the numbers there are.

RATING: 7.5
What a great concept! Playing to be the Upperclass Twit of the Year by losing all your money. Very creative in its mechanisms, which, many as they are, get spread out in a simple manner accross the various boards and on the cards themselves. This may well become the go-to gateway game, even though it does have enough meat on its bones to keep the serious gamer interested.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A quick and good-looking engine game. Quite a few different approaches available but those are pretty much dictated by starting hands and other early card draws.

If you are in a hurry and can trust the other players not making mistakes, the action phase can be played simultaneously.

Because of the useless cheap insert, the boards are warped by default.

Enjoyable money-sinking game which improves in feel if you can play along with the thematics - although jokes about taking your dog out for dinner get old quickly! Gaming-wise, a bit of a mish-mash, but there's less downtime than might be expected, and the turn order track is a part of the game which has been judged to agonising perfection.

RATING: 7
The theme: spoilt relatives compete for Rich Uncle™'s fortune by competing to spend money the fastest.

Players start off with a wad of cash, then spend it dissolutely over a series of rounds, visiting the track, partying with dodgy friends, buying houses and depreciating them... First to run out triggers endgame, but beware of Prodigal Sons that plunge deeper into debt than you do.

In the game all your opportunities to squander wealth are represented by cards, and these appear in random order. This seems to create a degree of chaos: further play will (I hope) mitigate this as we get to know the game. Otherwise Last Will is deep and requires careful planning. We found it played slow, but not unduly so for first play of a complex game.

Components are great (some of the card artwork is quite funny), and there are no colourblind problems at all.

Le tenía fe por la temática y el arte, pero tuvo otro mérito inesperado. La temática no atenta contra la mecánica. Muchas veces "rolear" un juego te empuja a ser menos eficiente, pero este no es el caso. Las anécdotas memorables vienen de la mano de una necesaria "engine de despilfarro". Así que reconcilia bien el desafío euro con la narrativa, y ambas se retroalimentan.

This is a blast to play! You start off with an amount of money and the goal is to spend it all before the last round of play. There are all sorts of things you can spend it on and invest in farms or mansions. There seem to be many strategies you could try. This is a medium weight game that plays well with 2-players and up. The components and artwork are top quality. Love it!

RATING: 8
The game is one of finding an early strategy (in the plan to spend all your money faster than everyone else) and then choosing the turn order set that's most appropriate each turn. The early turn order sets offer early choice of which cards to take from the draft but then don't offer many actions in which to execute them. The latter ones offer the dregs of what's left but offer more actions, so if you've saved cards from the previous round, here's how you get them out. That's the essence. After that it's hoping that the strategy you've chosen gets rid of your money faster than everyone else. There's a nice mix in strategies - invest in houses and watch them depreciate automatically (but then have to worry later about selling them and accidentally getting money back), going an event type strategy (gets lots of card draws for free and spend your actions playing them one by one), getting layabout helpers which auto-drain your money each turn, etc. So strategically there's enough to explore here for a while, and the choice of turn order and then how you go about tactically playing is a good one each turn. In essence it's worker placement (taking turns taking cards or manipulating the modifiers in the real estate market for buying or selling property cards) but there's enough extra here to keep it fresh-ish. And the theme is a beauty.

What a unique theme for a game.  The theme and mechanics are tied together really well.  Selecting your actions/turn order at the beginning of your turn is fun, and that sets you up for selecting your errands.  And then you execute your "action points" by laying down cards, building up your engine, and getting rid of that money!  And it has a funny sense of humor mixed in, for instance, you can take your dog out to dinner in order to spend money faster!  Not as heavy as I thought it was going to be, but certainly not a gateway game.

An original idea of having to spend all your money to prove yourself to your wealthy uncle. You buy houses, go on vacations all to be the first do dispose of all your money. The mechanics of the cards and what is considered an action take some time to understand, but the game is quite interesting. It have very little player involvement and some down time while people select their actions, but once you all know how to play, you can simply all perform your actions at the same time. One warning though, if you play with only $70 to start, a lot of the cards are useless since the longer term cards such as houses and farms do not have time to become of value. You should play with $100 or more to start, then the game is much better.

But winning is irrelevant to my enjoyment of a game and it is a game I shall look forward to playing again and again. A relative has left a small fortune to the player who can LOSE all of their money the quickest. Obviously the idea comes from the film Brewsters Millions. Lite fun, but requires a reasonable amount of strategy in this worker placement game. Reasonably convincing theme.

What a charming little game!  It's basically a drafting game, and once you get over the "spending money is good" thing, it's very intuitive.  The game really features building out card combos that let you get rid of a lot of money.  The variable actions per turn was a nice touch, as players can focus on action-intensive cards that get rid of money fast, or no-action cards that allow you to avoid constantly trying to get more actions.  Lots to explore here.  Just don't be fooled into thinking the game will go a full seven rounds; it may end well before that depending on the starting money.

Last Will has neat mechanics for determining turn order and how many cards, worker placements, and actions each player will receive on a given round. This adds a nice layer of interaction to what otherwise would be multi-player solitaire. Players are building their own tableau of card combination which reminded me of the game London. Our first game got off to a slow start since everyone was new to the game and needed to get up to speed on the iconography. All and all a very good game.  Last Will is probably best with 4.

What makes this game interesting is how players are trying to lose/spend money as fast as possible. While other games have you trying to build, here you're trying to do the opposite.

Sigo pensando que es un buen juego, se tienen que hacer combos con cartas.

RATING: 5
Cute, but rulesey game where the theme is to spend as much money as possible as fast as possible. In reality, this is an engine building game with a very minor worker placement element. Spaces to take actions are tight, but most of what happens is driven by your cards and the number of actions you get from your starting bid. The game attempts to tell a story with it's impressive card art, but it falls a little short in that sense because there are multiple copies of each card in the game, making it feel a little more about mechanics than theme. This would normally be great, except that the theme is the real selling point here.

We had quite a bit of fun with Last Will. The theme is fun and it doesn't suffer 2-player. I enjoy the timing aspect as well as manipulating the real estate market. Jason enjoyed this equally as much. Thematically, it feels like a bastard step-child to Monopoly, but with much more interesting decisions. So that's great because I never had an issue with Monopoly.

RATING: 4
Everyone goes on about how different it is to be getting rid of money rather than making it, but I disagree. It's just the same, but with a negative sign. Even the properties are only really like taking a loan in a profit-making game, but then having to pay it back before you can earn more than a certain amount of money. And it has the London syndrome of long turns where one player manages their tableau while everyone else just has to sit and watch.

Brewster's Millions the boardgame, kept expecting to see Richard Pyror turn up. 
The premise to to loose your initial stake as quickly as possible Combines worker placement with action point and card drafting. The cards are activities to burn money some are ongoing which may or may not require later actions to use and others are one time expenditures, properties to neglect, and people to help spend your money. Sounds like a lot going on but it blends farily well.

The initial placement determines a combination of turn order, card draws, draft actions, and card placement usage actions with a nice trade-off between the various levels. Once you have drafted your cards you decide which actions you will take the cards pretty much tell you what actions it costs to use them. Some cards go on your tableau so they can be reused in future turns.

Fresh touch on engine-building. First you build an engine, then need to tear the most efficient parts of it down before the end while still trying to spend money to really finish the game. As all this is done during just 5-7 turns with a few actions, so the game requires very careful timing.

RATING: 5.5
Another card-drafting/engine builder/solitaire game. The theme and artwork (especially the artwork) are very nice but the game does not do it for me at all. There is almost no interaction in this game and everyone is just trying to create an (negative) engine to loose all his money first. Take cards, create combos with your actions, don't mind what the others are doing and whoever gets there first is the winner. Not my cup of tea, but I don't like games without interaction in general and this is one of the best examples of a game that I would not consider a boardgame in the first place (no board, no game).

RATING: 6.5
Enjoyable theme. Excellent components. But I already have too many of this type of game. I get this feeling halfway into the game that no matter which strategy you pursue it will be close and it really comes down to optimizing all the time. At the end you can think of a few times that you might have done better (though, often, you can't pinpoint any particular moment), but you realize that it would have taken some AP to achieve that efficiency. Yes, some people are better at it than others and they will probably win this type of game more often, but I just find this kind of game play ultimately unsatisfying. Reminds me of Endeavor, another game that had nice components and theme but left me  wondering at the end of another close game why the winner--even if it was me-- won. (NOTE: It's not engine building or efficeincy per se that I don't like. I like Thurn and Taxis for example. Hmmmm. Will have to think on this.)

An interesting and different theme for a worker placement. Instead of accruing the most money or points, you want to be the first to lose it all. Game is medium weight with a medium pace. There are a lot of icons utilized which can make this a bit difficult to teach and your first couple plays will take longer due to needing references on many of the cards. Fun theme that is better with more players in my opinion. One of the more unique worker placement games I have played.

This game is an interesting mix of card management, tableau building and worker placement.  However, it is a really tough game with respect to game play but the mechanics are pretty straight forward.

This was a fairly heavy and lengthy game. It doesn't have to be but players will end up pondering their moves and holding things up a lot (which is silly given that you can plan your whole move out before it gets to you). 
Essentially everyone plays cards trying to find combinations that waste as much money as possible in the hope that they will go bankrupt first. However, leaving that aside it is still just a simple points accumulating game in which players trade off between actions and better choices of cards (which convert actions to points at various rates).
A little too heavy for the theme, a little too light for the length. Though I won fairly clearly I didn't find it a particularly satisfying experience.

Not a terribly bad game and there is some fun here, but it just wasn't all that exciting for us. There are so many different cards, none of which were all that exciting.

This game is by the same designer as Shipyard. This has a lot less to think about than Shipyard, but the theme is fun and it's a nice little game.
The idea is to go broke. You can buy properties and let them depreciate, then sell them at a loss
You can throw parties which waste money, hire servants etc. Pretty much all the things we can waste money on in real life, you can do here.
First guy to go bankrupt wins.

Rating is based on the game + getting sacked expansion, which I wouldn't play without.

While the game itself is really creative, the story and components hilarious, and the rulebook one of the funniest and most delightful I've read, the gameplay itself - even with the expansion - is not the most exciting. Sure the game is fun and we do like to return to it occasionally, but usually we just feel there is something better to play.

Play one game with the minimum (70 pound) amount of money to get a feel for the cards, tempo, and possibilities.  Then play with the random starting amounts.  I don't think farms pay out at the smaller starting amounts as we were ending the game in Turn 5 (of 7).  A bit more money is likely to let farms be a viable option.

The game is about setting a plan but one strongly driven by the cards available to you.  More importantly, how to get cards to work together for an increased effect.  Feels like things are tight every turn (wanting to do more but trying to squeeze the most out of what you do have).

Clearly well-designed, but I just can't stand this type of game:
- feels like a choose-your-own-adventure. Instead of a decision space to explore, you can just take several designed trails. There's a lot of trails, but they feel artificial.
- little player interaction. The interaction that's there is just annoyance.
- it's a card game, but getting cards is fiddly. So many steps! Place order markers. Then, in order, place errand boys. Then take cards. Then play them.
- You have to plan your entire turn up front - how many actions you'll need, how much money, how many spaces. Run through a few options to see which is best. It's a lot of work, and annoying if you mess it up.
- There are some decent decisions and the use-up-your-money mechanic is great, but just too much fiddly work to get there.

My first play was 5 player with all players new to the game, and the fact that no-one knew what they were doing, plus a couple of slower players in the mix, did mean that there were severe downtime issues.  The gameplay itself I found very enjoyable though, was much better with 4 the next time!  Enough strategy to give you real decisions, and enough theme that it isn't just calculating actions.

Teljesen hagyományos worker placement azzal megborítva, hogy itt nem gyűjtenünk kell, hanem éppen ellenkezőleg, minél gyorsabban kiköltekezni. Ezen kívül semmi extra csavar nincs a játékban, de valahogy mégis jól működik az egész.
Talán abban jobb kissé, mint a nagy átlag, hogy igen eltalált a hangulata. Humorosak a képek, a kártyák, jók a rajzok, segítik mindazt, hogy megfelelően átéljük a storyt.
Eléggé anyagerősnek is mondható a játék a mai felhozatalt ismerve. Akinek még nem folyik ki a fülén a munkáslehelyezős mechanizmus annak mindenképpen érdemes kipróbálnia, talán olyat ad a téma, amit az átlag játékától nem.
Nehéznek nem mondanám, de azért talán egy játékokkal most ismerkedő személyt nem ehhez ültetnék le először, mert van pár apró részlet, amire figyelni kell, illetve elsőre elijesztő lehet az ikonrendszer is (de valójában logikus, jól felépített).

Your uncle is dead, Horaay!!!! He's a very rich man without any friend or heir. He decided to pass the wealth to the nephew that knows best to spend money. So your task is to spend as much money as possible! This trick is very special. It reverses every game idea of gaining resources or cracking your opponents. Instead, you got to waste more money! And the mechanics are also awesome. There are many different ways to achieve your goal based on different cards your draft. But some of the cards are overpowered I believe, and the real estate strategy is comparatively weak. Maybe I need more sessions to prove it.

This game is refreshingly different from most other games I've played.

A fun theme nicely integrated into the cards and gameplay. I like particularly how you manage property so you sell at the right time to not waste the opportunity of getting rid of cash by having cash in hand. Picking the right cards for your strategy is satisfying. There's a good selection of cards to choose from so you'll have the chance to try different approaches from game to game. Not much player interaction - sure, turn selection and choosing cards or the all important property modifier space, but it's more a case of a good option or a better option to choose from rather than anything worthless.

There's some interesting paths as you're looking for a suitable engine to get rid of money, but I'm not sure how much the game is determined by the draw of the cards and the turn order. It's all so marginal that going first on the right round will make the different between a win or loss. It plays well with up to five players, but because of the turn order I'd rather play it with three or four. There's a variant where the player taking the opera space becomes start player and that might be worth trying out.

Another mix of known mechanics, this time mainly worker placement and card management, in order to build a scoring machine.

If the Richard Pryor film "Brewster's Millions" were turned into a board game, and Pryor was replaced with a English dandy, Last Will would be close to the result. Spend as much money as you can, faster than everyone else. First person to go zero (or in debt) triggers the end of the game, and the one whose poorest wins. I like the theme.

It does have worker placement which can upset players plans but in general there are alternative placements that make this interaction rarely pivotal to the game's outcome. I like this game, and will happily play it again but I imagine the gaming group would prefer worker placement games that provide more conflict.

This is on ok game that feels a bit different due to the concept of spending all your money.  The +1 action cards are grossly unbalanced compared to anything else, at minimum they should cost 2 actions to play.  Card strength in general varies a great deal, so the winner is usually determined by the +1 action cards or some of the few other cards which allow free bonus actions (like the stewards which allow you to use a mansion or farm for free each turn).

So this is an ok filler game but I don't see this one having any long term staying power.

RATING: 1
2 solo plays.

Well as far as resource management optimisation worker placement go this one at least has a theme that makes sense plus some light hearted illustrations and it all makes you ignore how fiddly the game actually is (like in AT). 

The Bad: All the theme aside, the game is fiddly and demands quite some thinking to figure out the best option, I'd say it can induce AP. The worse thing about it is how uninspiring it is as a design - it's just throw together actions and a resource engine and add many many many cards. Wheeee. I like it better than Manhattan Project, but it's the same type of dreck. 

The Ugly: Well, it's an amusing insight into the culture of consumerism. I mean, not intentionally, but why do we find spending money more attractive then getting it? Is a simulation of work more tedious than simulation of "leisure time"? And the game also reminds us that spending money is work, something every consumer should be more aware of. 
Another ugly thing: boards, what's with the brown? This could be even more charming game if the who graphic design and illustration weren't trying so hard to be cute.

The Good: Well it's amusing, the theme works, you work to bring it together (as in all worker placements). I suspect I'll like it better as a solo game, then actually playing with people. 

EDIT: reason this has fallen to 1.0 - it's just another soulless workerplacement, derivative of many other worker placements. but it's made ENTIRELY IN BROWN!!! Argh, it's a crime against my soul!

RATING: 7
Played once with 5P and once with 3P, with a 2 year gap between games. The best thing going for Last Will is its clever and humorous theme, which truly exemplifies the embarrassment of riches. Once past the fact that the game really is about VP accumulation in reverse, this is a mishmash of worker placement, hand management and engine-building.

Last Will treads each of its gameplay elements lightly and never overwhelms players with decisions. Even the variety of cards in the game are surprisingly simplistic once players grasp the iconography. The exception here is property, which offers a bit more decisions in whether to allow it to depreciate in value. (As a side note, the simplicity is likely the result of the design having to rely on the limited actions and cards as resources to pay for the parts of the engine.) 

Overall, Last Will is a step up from gateway games. There is a bit of luck involved, especially since the first player may have a distinct advantage when there is a good selection of cards available. The game may not have a lot of replay value though.

Minél gyorsabban kell elverni a nagypapától szerzett örökséget. Jól kitalált téma, nagyon szép játékelemek, fix körös játék kártyákkal. Nagyon jól hangzik. Jó is, nyelvfüggetlen, cserébe sokfajta ikont kell megtanulni, de második játékra szerintem sima ügy. Többfajta kártyát lehet különböző módon szerezni a játékban és ezekkel kell minél több pénzt elköltenünk a körünkben. Jól eltalált a sorrendet, laphúzást, lapszerzést és akciószámot eldöntő választómechanizmus, de más újdonságot nem találtam a játékban. Valószínűleg ez sem az, de tetszett mindenesetre. Egyértelműen London hatás érződik a játékon. Nekem az jobban tetszett, de jól működik ez a játék is. Nem rossz, de semmi kiemelkedő.

Quite good, actually. You're really working with a bunch of different things in this one - the number of cards in your hands, the properties you manage, along with the number of errand boys (actions) and turn order. This makes for some interesting decisions for what to do and when to do it. Even better, certain properties and actions lead you to a sequence of events, allowing you to generate the synergy that makes playing fun. The theme is fun, too.

Another Euro engine building game, this time with the aim of going bankrupt. Initially, the quirky theme and intricacies of making an engine set to lose money kept me interested but the theme eventually disappeared altogether and now I see it as just another dry Euro.

Not yet played with the expansion, but I really like the way this game plays out. My biggest disappointment is that it doesn't feel like you can really get an engine going before you have to rip it all down, but I think the expansion will help with that, thanks to the ongoing gain of money and minimum round length as you try to get fired. We'll see!

Good theme in a bad game. Equal parts hand management and worker placement, Last Will plays like multiplayer solitaire, despite some semblance of interaction. What little interaction there is, annoys. Most cards you receive aren't useful, so you're left with a bunch of mostly mediocre cards that don't combo well; there's little sense of excitement. Worst of all, the game is full of tedious bookkeeping. With its fiddly ruleset, Last Will is like estate law itself, but less interesting. It's a VP race where the VPs count down rather than up. As go the VPs, so goes the fun.

So yes, not for me but others obviously like it.

RATING: 6.5
1 play, 3er.

Interesting game of action selection and hand management. Thematically, it's Brewster's Millions: start with a bunch of money, spend it as quickly as possible (max 7 rounds). 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
There are several types of cards: black (properties, people), white (single-use actions), special (mix of black and white), and gray (dog, horse, woman, or chef). At the start of the game, players get 4 cards from which to choose 2 to keep, and $70-100 (depending on desired game length?).

Start each round by placing a different mix of cards in designated face up spaces on the board. In player order, first choose a position on the action selection board; each has you draw a different number of cards (0-7) and actions (1-4). Also, the chosen spaces determine player order (left to right). Then, in the new turn, go around twice selecting one of the action locations (take the designated card, adjust building price modifier, take an extra board space, draw a card off the top of a deck).

In turn order, players use their 0-7 actions. Actions include:
- playing white (single-use) cards for their benefit -- often just a way to spend money
- play black cards into one of your board spaces (start with 5; may acquire more during game). Some cost extra actions to play, buildings cost money (printed cost modified by modifiers on board and/or your other black cards).
- improve a black card: some can be improved by spending an action and placing an animal (a colored disc, acquired with a gray card or some white cards)

Play continues for 7 rounds, or until someone manages to spend all their money AND has no black property cards on their board. The player with the least money (may be negative on that final round) wins!

This is essentially Brewster's Millions, the board game.  It's also similar to the Mad Magazine board game.

It is a worker placement affair where each player starts with a certain amount of money and is trying to lose as much of it as possible before game end.  The actions you take are mostly acquiring cards that come in a few different flavors.  There are one time activities that cost you a certain amount of money, ongoing effect cards like standing reservations at a restaurant that cost you money each turn, and the most in depth, there are properties that you can buy for large amounts of money but you then have to turn around and sell them before you can really go broke.  But these properties also have upkeep that can regularly drain your bank account and there are ways to lower the value of the property before you need to sell.

It is a fun and interesting theme but all-in-all it is still pretty by-the-numbers.  It's done well though and has a lot of charm.

Occasionally a game or two appear with a nice new idea. Last Will is one of those cases because players have to destroy all their assets and money and that tilts players's brains. Mine for sure! The secret of the game seems to lay on the perfect timing of selling stuff. Players need to sell everything in order to win but when doing this players lose the ability to spend their money. There's a lot to decide here because everything has to be very well balanced in order to succeed!
On the downside we have the lack of interaction and the downtime which, I can imagine with 5 players, may be unbearable!

My wife and I really like this game--it's about the only CGE game we don't own simply because it came out right when we had stopped buying more games.  We have a copy in our game group, but I certainly wouldn't mind trading for a copy.  There are a lot of interesting decisions and yet it doesn't suffer from long downtime as those decisions are nicely broken into bite-sized chunks.  The art work is lovely, and the theme and setting are unique and different.

This game shocked me.  I had actively avoided playing it on multiple previous occasions since I assumed it was another boring, Euro-style game with a theme as thin as Kate Moss on coke.  Also, I had heard from a couple of people that Last Will would be a fairly average, nondescript game if the goal of the game had been to accumulate money or VPs (as with many other games) rather than trying to get rid of cash.  None of this ended up being accurate.  By the end of my first play I still didn't understand all the elements of the game (I'm not the sharpest spoon in the drawer), but I was severely impressed with how they all came together to make a truly interesting game.  By the end of the second game, by which time I could spend less time trying to wrap my head around the rules and more time enjoying the atmosphere created by the theme and components, I was really quite blown away.  If I was playing with a group of friends who weren't in a hurry, I would love to incorporate a rule where each player had to tell a mini story as they played their cards on their turn, since there's something quite funny about going on a theatre date with your horse.  And that's the real beauty of Last Will: it exercises your brain with a lot of difficult decisions (even the turn order element is so well balance that it leads to an agonizing choice each turn), while telling quite a humorous story with a theme that is not only incredibly well incorporated for a Euro game, but is truly unique and fun amongst even thematic games (with very cute artwork to boot).  Despite the fact that it's a medium-weight game with a bit of a learning curve (while I'm at a stage in life where mainly short, light games get played,), I'm going to have to add this one to my WishList.  Game design: 4.5/5  Personal enjoyment: 4/5  Total: 8.5/10

Solid engine-building race game that gets quite far on novelty alone -- you're trying to spend money rather than make it. Mechanically, the only reason this makes any difference is because of the rule that you cannot go into debt as long as you own real estate (you have to sell it first).

I don't like the basic game much because 70M offers the least scope for engine-building; it's about efficiency of time as well as effort, so it's tediously incremental.

Luck of the card draw is significant enough to put the game in the category of light time-waster. It's not bad but it's not great.

Better than Race for the Galaxy or 7 Wonders, due to the board that was not just a playing area but an important and cleverly balanced element of game play and a fun theme.

More to it than just the lightweight game that it appears to be on the surface. Enough variation for replayability, and enough fun to want to play again.
Has similarities to London, and I'd have liked cards that give money to other players rather than just spend to the bank. The wooden pieces are tiny, and badly designed because of that, but small grumbles for an otherwise really good game.

Update - slightly put off this game after a dominant strategy seemed to emerge in our group. I'd like it more if each route to victory had as much chance as the next, but now we all just play the same way, and the player that gets the right cards at the right time wins.

I still really want to like the game though, so will most likely just play 2P or solo.

An interest engine building game where you're spending your money as opposed to trying to earn more.  I like how the property works, especially the depreciation.  This game is simple on the whole, but some of the inconography is a bit screwy.  It's too complex for a gateway game, but it's also a bit light for a gamer's game.  This one sits in a weird place.

A medium-light Euro optimisation game. It's decent, but nothing that sets the world on fire.

It's semi-lightness is what separates this from all the other Euro optimisation games for me. But not by that much.

The 'Brewsters Millions' game.  It is fun, and neat that it makes you think in exactly the opposite ways of the typical game, however, once you boil it back down, it's still same tired mechanics which make an alright game, but nothing special.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In the end I tend to enjoy mid to heavy weight euros the best.  This one fits there but also turns you head around trying to think opposite to what you normally would (Lose your money instead of try to gain it) and that makes it a keeper

Fun little game, where the goal is exactly like Brewster's Millions - spend all your money and be broke at the end of the game. I'm not sure that the combination of cards is so vast that there aren't a couple of strategies that dominate. An expansion set could give this a lot of legs.

Last Will has separated itself from the huge pack of Eurogames out there, and worker placement games specifically, by having a hilarious theme.  Players are trying to blow through money as fast as they can, which is really just a slight twist on earning as much money as possible.  The difference is that it feels lighthearted and fun, even as you try to be as efficent as possible at losing money (inefficient as possible?).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Fun twist in theme, but the mechanics feel tired, and the game doesn't really offer anything innovative. It's like having fun (in theme) is a chore itself.

I really need to play this again to see where my rating shakes out, but my initial impression is "good but not great." Of course, we played a five-player game with one of the boards flipped to the wrong side, so there were fewer card choices than there should have been, which may change my take on the game a bit. Still ... the game felt a lot like many others; I'm not part of the crowd that thinks just because your engine is spending money rather than earning it that there's something radically inventive here ... Update: I continue to play this when asked (now about 5-6 plays), but find this a solid rather than exceptional design.

Not bad, but it's not as good as other light euros to which it might be compared (Stone Age, Waterdeep, etc.). It also seems like taking a heavy card strategy is not as good as other strategies because of the extra randomness involved.

RATING: 5
For the most part it plays like a stealth deckbuilder with the emphasis on gaining actions and taking free actions as part of your turn but the card tableaux rather than cycling hands makes it quite overwhelming in the final turns as you have to do a lot of calculation to figure out what to do.  Too much fiddling around, not enough reward.

I'm on the fence on this one. I really wanted to play after watching a couple of games because I love the theme (rich person has to spend all their money first - like Brewster's Millions). Unfortunately, I think I may have had different expectations from what the game actually is. This game has a traditional victorian feel to it, so there are no fun/amusing elements like hiring Bon Jovi to play your kid's birthday party (which, unfortunately, is what I was hoping for in this game). 

That said, the game does play well. The mechanics are sound. There appear to be multiple paths to victory (I need at least one more replay to feel better on this). The artwork is ok and if you're in to victorian themes you'll probably enjoy it (along with a bazillion other Euro games, which is why I find this one so tired).

I will likely adjust my rating after further plays.

Another gem in the CGE library. 'Brewster's Millions' the Boardgame has you racing to squander an inheritance before your spoiled friends. The theme and art are funny and engaging but the gameplay itself is in itself a lot of fun.

A single bid each round determines your turn order, the number of cards you get to draw, the number of face-up cards you get to claim, and the number of actions you get to take.

There's also a sine balancing point between investing in doomed real estate (remember - buy high, sell low!), using it to lead you to financial ruin, but selling at the right moment and having the engine in place to squander the proceeds from the sale before your opponents go bankrupt.

I love the theme of this game. It always creates funny comments between the players. The game also has depth, many thoughtfull choices, and varying strategies to achieve your ultimate goal: spending all your money!

The mechanics are not as connected to theme as I'd like, the game is too mathematical for little reason, and the many different phases slow it down considerably.

Overall, I like it, although I think that the theme deserves an even better game.

It's like the movie [i]Brewster's Millions[/i]: the heirs are on the verge to receive a hue amount of money, but only one of them will get it: the one that spend more in less time, enjoying life to the fullest, even if fullest means to take your horse and dog to a boat trip. Is this kind of spending I'm talking about.

Well, the game is a straight foward work placement and hand management. You use errand boys to get cards, change the price of houses and farms, to add a space in the player board, and other things.

With the cards and actions the player can buy things to sell cheap later, spend on carriage rides, dinner reservations and so on.

The game lasts about 90 minutes and I believe there is many ways to achieve the objective of run out of money, so there is a good room for replayability.

The art in the cards is very well made, and the components are good and sturdy, and the humor is there (it might get old, but I don't think so).

My one play of this was a very tight affair, all of us going a vaguely similar but divergent enough path - get some real estate, sink lots of actions in upkeep, and then flounder for a bit as we realize we'll have to get rid of that real estate. The game had enough texture to keep it interesting, for instance in the initial planning phase where you choose your card/hat/action "bucket" and in the differences between the types of property. Seems like there should be enough room to play to try some different techniques out.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Just too stale in it's lack of tension for such a pretty thing. While the turnorder and drafting mechanic are great ideas, the card powers are too narrow to either differentiate the players, or even your own choices and hand management, to be anything but disultory. One or two interesting decisions in the whole, overlong game.

In his last will, your rich uncle stated that all of his millions will go to the nephew who can enjoy money the most. How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance – oh, and win the game.

I often don't enjoy engine-building games as they're usually pretty dry and lose interest once you've built your engine, but this game light and quick enough, with a fun theme to make it all palatable.

The art work and components are all charming.  There is a bit too much of a luck factor in starting hands.  You might end up with a perfect engine off the bat, or a bunch of trash you can't really use.  The game overall feels a bit quick, as soon as you do get an engine you're usually bankrupt and selling property after just a few turns.

Pretty good game, feels a bit lacking, think I'd really like to try it with he expansion to see if that fills it out a bit.  Otherwise the gameplay feels a bit one-dimensional, almost too quick and pretty much on auto-pilot after the initial few turns once you setup your engine.

RATING: 6
This is a multi-layered worker placement game, where first you place your piece to determine the number of workers you can place in the second round, as well as determining how many cards you can draw, how many actions you can take, etc.  From there, the game is a fairly standard optimization game where you want to put together a good engine to allow you to "get points" through spending your money.  In fact, the game could easily have run the engine in the other direction to allow you to start at zero and gain points through your optimization efforts, but it's novel in that it's driving you to spend your money instead.  It's only an issue when you get to the end of the game and have to determine who's most in debt (there aren't any physical reminders to note when you go negative), but it's a minor quibble.  I liked it more than I was expecting to.

Last Will is hard game to wrap your head around the first few times that you play it. Strictly speaking, it is just another tableau building card game, although in this case it revolves around a unique theme that challenges players to create a money consuming engine. The hard to grasp part is in trying to do things as inefficiently as possible. Things like manipulating the real estate market so that you can buy high and sell low. Looking for ways to spend extra money goes against everything you know about economic Euros, but here it is the path to victory. It shouldn't be that difficult, but I sometimes have a hard time seeing the best way to make my cards act as inefficient as possible. It's just not instinctual to try and do things the long way, so I occasionally overlook the best move.

There's no doubt that the theme sort of carries the game. The language neutral iconography is kind of a mess (think Race for the Galaxy's little brother) and there is a fair amount of luck due to the random nature of the cards. Face-up card drafting is fairly limited, forcing you to base your strategy on a lot of blind draws. This would be a crippling criticism for most games, but again, the theme is so original and so well realized that most gamers will give it a free pass for those inadequacies.

one of those games that, for me, is just devoided of any possible fun. playing this is just no fun at all, and i am sorry i can't even tell exactly what it is that makes it so boring.
it has some original aspects, like "you must lose money to win and you can't lose money until it is invested in property". nice idea, really.
but beside that, it is just an accountant game

[EDIT]
three years later i completely removed from my mind the first experience and i asked eagerly to play it again. Only after a long while i realized this wasnt the first time i had this bad experience. Once again i really didnt like this: too complicated, too many details, no fun... just a little bit of tensione toward the end of the game to make it not desperately horrible, just not a good game for me (but those who played with me liked it somehow)

Decent card game with a bit of worker placement. Trying to get rid of a fortune of money by taking trips, hiring help and committing to buildings. Selling off your engine near the end is a bit unique.

Spending money instead of building it up -- who would have thought that such a simple switch would make for a good game? Of course, a solid design outside of that "gimmick" helps things a lot. This one's a keeper.

Only played once so far, and it seemed a little fiddly.  Will need to give this another chance and see if my opinion of it goes up or not.

Eén van de leukste anti-thema's die er is.

Je bent een erfgenaam die zo snel mogelijk al zijn/haar geld er doorheen moet jagen om een grote erfenis te mogen ontvangen. Dit doe je door huizen te laten verwaarlozen en vooral erg veel onnodig geld uit te geven.

Dit spel is in essentie wel weer één van die worker-placements. Daarnaast is er ook nog een gedeelte waarin je het persoonlijk bezigbent het geld uit te geven.

I love all the decisions you have to make. The objective of the game is a little counter-intuitive and requires a slight paradigm shift and there's lots of moving parts, but I always enjoy myself with Last Will.

4/3/14 Managed to get Damien to teach it. Not as fun as I expected, the actions phase is a bit tricky but quite fun nonetheless. 

4/7/14 Not as hard to teach as I'd imagined, but still moving so many small bits around its fiddly. The concept is good, but execution is highly mechanical although everything fits. Will try with the Getting Sacked XP next. Provisional 7.

Be the first to lose your money!

[i]Living Will[/i] is the worker placement and tableau-building equivalent of the [i]Mad Magazine Game[/i], except that it doesn't make you roll dice left handed, isn't graced with Sergio Aragones and Al Jaffee art, and isn't remotely fun.

Not one smile crack'd. Not one.

Turn order is decided by placing a pawn. If you go early you do not get as much stuff but you get to choose first. If you go later you get more stuff but your options are limited. That works great. The idea that you spend money instead of gaining money is fun and cute but it really is the same thing. Good solid game.

Gets a few points for the unusual and humorous theme alone. After players gets familiar with the mechanics of the game they can even start to role play a bit and add to the fun. Properties at first seemed like a flaw in the game, but after real play it looked more balanced. Need to play more to see if it is a viable strategy indeed. Chaining actions reminds Dominion a bit.

Pretty tight game, randomness of cards can be addressed by increasing the amount you draw. Some rules complexity or maybe the rules are just attempting to be very precise.

[microbadge=31774] Gifted to Corbin as part of his Christmas gift (2016). A very fun worker placement game that I'm happy to play anytime. There's just something so amusing about needing to get RID OF money instead of accruing it to win! :D

Quirky Euro with an offbeat theme that has some cool mechanics underneath. I like the variety in cards and how the different rows work, and the tableau/engine-building that goes on for each person. There are two clear strategies and possibly several blends you can pursue. We played our second 2-player game in about 40-45 minutes which I think is the perfect amount of time for this game. I'm really eager to see how it plays with more players since competition for cards/spaces will be very much present.

7 after 1 play.

Theme is unique and humourous, but replayability may be low. Action taking portion seems a little solitaire, and player interaction is therefore on the low side.

The theme is great. I never knew it was so hard to spend money. And I like that aspect about the game: it isn't about who got the most money in the end, but about who spends all his/her money first. I also like how the player order is determined and the incentives you get for being later in player order. And seriously who doesn't want to go to the opera with his dog and horse, enjoying a nice evening and having a personal butler? 

I really would love to try out the expansion: Getting sacked.

I'd been ignoring this one as "another worker placement with a funny theme," but a chance to play it at Con of the North changed my mind in a hurry! Overall its is "just another Euro"... but the elements come together in a nice tight fun fast game. A bit of the build and run of London, but with more engine building and interesting worker placement choices instead of a nearly pointless map in the middle.  The theme doesn't really hold up as all that funny with repeated plays 9though the occasional "and I'll take my dog out to dinner" comment still gets a chuckle) and people should definitely be warned about a bit more learning curve than you might expect... but it only takes 2-3 games for a new player to catch up with the pros.

Love the theme, love the reverse mechanism of trying to spend as much money as possible, and it plays quickly and efficiently. It became my (and my wife's) second favourite game after only 2 plays.

EDIT: Rating reduced to a 7. Still a fun game with a unique theme but the desire to play it has definitely waned. Other games with similar mechanics are more interesting to me and I had little interest in acquiring The Prodigals Club which confirmed the rating had to be reduced.

I like that it requires different strategies depending on how much money you start with. The theme is great.

The game feels like it's on rails to some extent, especially in the end game, where you just need to get some good event cards with the corresponding guest.

Best thing here is the variable "starting cash."  Starting with lower totals changes the game completely when comparing it to high totals.  

Thematically, this fairly light game could be taught to non-gamers even though it isn't quite light enough to be called a true gateway game.  Perhaps "almost a gateway?"  It's like a board game of the movie Brewster's Millions, and I think almost everyone would find taking their dog and their horse to dinner with their personally hired chef at least mildly amusing.

Players are Victorian dandies trying to blow all their money as fast as possible, the player most in debt is the winner. A lot of symbols and different card types can make this a difficult game to learn, but there is a good variety of ways to spend your money and it's fun to see and share in what other people do.

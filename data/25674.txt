RATING: 7
Rating after 1 play.
When the rules were being explained to me they seemed incomprehensible and complicated, however once into play the game rules were actually quite intuitive.  There were just a lot of them to remember.
2nd however, the strategy of the game is complicated!  There is a lot going on and I usually had a feeling that there was a brilliant move or moves there, if only I could see it.  This could lead to brainburn/downtime/analysis paralysis with the wrong player(s).

Overall though I enjoyed it.

An interesting game, but the mechanics of moving through time appear somewhat arbitrary. I personally had a very difficult time getting the rules down (to the best of my knowledge, I think I finally have them right). This will simply need more time on the table in order to more fully "get it".

03/09/2007: Rated after a single play.  The game intrigues me.  I want to play it again.  Possibilities for both offensive and defensive play.  Wise forecasting can help you gain tempo, or so it seems.  I think of the Age of Reason as a consolation prize for people who got the short end of the stick in the Age of Might or Faith.  At least it's a place you can go where you might be able to "do better" than you've done below.  The game is overproduced, and the price reflects it ($32 @B&B).

A very tricky game.  Fun, but tricky.

Age of Faith is underpowered compared to Age of Might.  Age of Reason isn't bad, but it's also below AoM.  A few strategies and some depth, but the total package feels lacking.  Will definitely play again, and will recommend playing, but it's not one of my favorites and likely won't ever be.

Really fast and interesting: you have several possibilities in your turn but well constrained by the building cards. You have to make your best of only four cards in a turn, traveling in time, destroying small buildings, causing conflicts of domains,...
When we played, we didn't make a lot of use of the Age of Reason.

Game is smart, original but complex. It takes a fair bit of time to understand how it works. Then it's still complex to play.

If it was all automated with computer assistance that would be great though.

I so wanted to play this... Time travel! What's not to like? But as it turns out, I couldn't even sit through the rule-teaching. This terrible sense of dread and doom and "This seems just like Elasund" kept creeping up on me; and I finally decided I'd rather have bamboo slivers shoved under my fingernails than find out whether, indeed, it was. So I took my leave. 

The players I quit on all liked/loved the game, so perhaps I missed out on something fantastic, but it just didn't feel like potential fun to me. Who knows, perhaps I'd need to be drunk to enjoy this game. But then, I don't play games while drunk, so I suppose I'll never know.

RATING: 3
There are too many rules and not nearly enough game to support them.  The box art suggests a wild and wacky time traveling adventure, but there's nothing wild, wacky, or adventurous about it.  By the end, I understood kind of what was going on, but only having four random cards in my hand severely limited me in being able to do anything to better my situation.  There was too much downtime, and not enough to do when it was my turn.  I had no fun whatsoever during this game.

This just fails to hit its theme squarely on the head, but it's a good try and a beautifully presented game. Mechanics are not quite there for me, but the premise of time travel being able to influence and change events and time lines is just a great hook for any game/tv show/film/book whatever!

A game I've expected a lot more. When I heard about theplaying system and saw the game, It sounded very good, but after playing I'm really disapointed. We got a lot of discussion and the cards are too decising. It's very expensive to replace them, and even that gives no security. This is the main reason why the game isn't good. And why not hold your cards you haven't played or more cards to choose from. Although the system of rippling is very inventive and new, I will not recommend this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Reminds me of Tigris & Euphrates, with three interrelated boards.  The temporal aspect is interesting, but not really well fleshed out.  It really just feels like three interrelated boards.  The rules are full of details/exceptions, which bogs down introduction of the game but are generally well understood after one playthrough.  The way domains (groups of buildings) combine reduces attacks through combining domains, but increases the seeming randomness (especially when combined with the temporal ripple).

It will take you some time to wrap your head around the rules, specially how events in one era ripple into other eras and have real impacts on the board. But if you like aggression in your euros this one is good.

First Play: Aware that there was alot to consider but not able to strategise my moves I got stuck into a battle with one player that left a fourth to take his pick over the other two boards. Very impressed with the idea and the mechanic.

The cards seem to be the only lottery aspect of the game and one player sufered as a result. However the varient and the open cards to choose from go some way to mitigate this problem.

I believe that this game has legs and I look forward to my second game.

Second Play 5 years later!!! Predictably had forgotten the rules and was reminded of what a brain burner this one is. The flow of the game is slow and very prone to AP but everyone agreed how clever it is. Play with 4 dragged a bit, perhaps the sweet spot is 3? Regardless I really enjoyed it and rating up'd to 8.

RATING: 7.5
You'd think that in a time-travel game you would have all the time in the world, but the main surprise was that game is only 7 (long) turns short to get all your points on the table. It takes a bit to get your head round, even more so if you're reading the rules and have to explain it to others without having played it at least once.

When you only have a handful of placements to make, it is no wonder that people think hard before committing. If they didn't, this would be a very fast game indeed. The need to consider placement carefully isn't helped by getting a completely new building hand at the end of each turn, so you can't really plan ahead. I have been wondering if drawing 6 cards at the start and being able to keep 2 in hand between turns would make it a bit more satisfying. Getting the wrong cards in any turn really hurts your chances, getting the right cards at the start will set you off cruising (4 orange cards - whoopie - control on board one and some serious rippling right away). Maybe its a personal preference, but I kinda like being able to plan at least [i]a bit[/i] ahead.

Having a 6 card hand will make it less likely to get stuck with a nigh unusable hand, and at the same time increase forward planning so you can make meaningful alternative plans when you do. Saying that, you can do quite a bit with tricky hands if you kick your brains in gear. But not enough to counter strong hands, and in a 7 round game, that can be a frustrating spoiler.

I had hoped to see the builders travel a bit more between boards, but since you aren't able to split your 2 cards between eras, there often isn't much sense in using the option, unless a scoring round follows or has just taken place. The main reason to quickly leave the board(s) you are concentrating on seems only to make real sense if you wanted to erect a defensive building that would stop a potential ripple onto your board. But to do so you would have to play both cards in another era, and that often is just too unattractive. The game does become more interesting when buildings get erected across eras so they block certain upgrades, maybe frequent play will throw the light on strategies that do make frequent hopping between boards an inviting strategy.

There are some seriously good ideas in this, especially the way the controlling building for scoring differs in each era, and the inability to build directly in the last era makes earlier choices very important. The one problem I had was that these choices are as likely to benefit other players if you cannot guarantee a decent follow-up, and they are lucky to draw it. Especially if you ripple some juicy scores onto the last board. The larger 6 card hand, or a Web of Power style 2-exposed-cards-next-to-the-blind-redraw-pile, seems an attractive way to address a point I do feel needs fixing, or at least tweaking: getting a way to manage your hand, rather than suffer through a bad draw.

The other great trick they pulled off is finding a great mechanism to concentrate players onto a smaller playing area when there are less participants, but still giving players the option to build on the more expensive terrains if they pay the price. Using terrain cost is so much neater than simply drawing a 3, 4, and 5 player border on the board.

If this game had been larger and longer than 7 turns, or if getting the right cards wasn't as important and luck-dependent as it is now, I think I would like this game an awful lot more. Right now the high hopes I had are far from shattered, but it isn't the "chaotic zipping back and forwards, rippling like mad" game I hoped for either.

Maybe the designers could go back to their drawing board and ripple out the perfect hand-management fix?

This game has an interesting premise but I don't really know whether I like it or not.

The rule book is AWFUL.
For people that are unaware of how the game plays, there are 9 buildings: 3 magenta, 3 orange, 3 blue. For each color there's a small, medium and big tile.
There are also three time periods.

In the rule book they had the awesome idea to force the theme down your throat by calling each kind of building with a different name (e.g. "big blue tile" = castle). This makes the rules VERY difficult to understand.
Also, they thought it was a good idea to give odd names to the time periods instead of calling them 1-2-3 (ok, that would have been un-thematic and dumb...).

Giving names to things in order to match the theme is okay, but when you have to come back to the beginning of the rule book to know what they're referring to... you've got a problem.

Very original time traveling game where things you build in the past get transferref into the future. This can create some very nice cascading effects. You play on three boards which all have a different goal and in the end you can only score on two. There is some concern about downtime as there is not much to do when others are playing.

I was introduced to this game as a "mindbender" and yes, it really is - certainly to the uninitiated. I've had a read through the rules a few times now and really want to have another pop at it!

I've now played this a second time (albeit over a year later) and it's definitely enjoyable. New palyers need help, but a second game would certainly help deal with the learning curve!

Still no clue about how to best approach this game.  The fact that my playgroup is quite divided about it doesn't help, either.  Some find it an intriguing, if perplexing exercise.  While others want to run it over with a truck.  Someone actually quit halfway through last time I played.

I'd like to try it more, but I have no idea if it's actually good or not.

After one play, which admittedly was a learning experience, I'm concerned that turn order or player position might be a significant factor in this game. The first player to go scored 30% of what everyone else did due to having one of his major buildings destroyed by a time shadow in turn 3.

I like the theme (time travel) but believe I need a few more playings to determine if it's flawed.

Shades of Tigris & Euphrates but played on 3 boards. The time rippling effect is neat. Surprising game with some depth considering there are only 7 turns per player.

Didn't like the fixed turn order. Game can be influenced by the randomness of cards. 

Update: rating dropped from 8 to 7. On replay, found it to be finicky and consequently to be inelegant. Confirmed that turn order and randomness of card draw can be frustrating. Will need further replay to reconsider.

Really liked the idea. Traded for it. Got it. Opened it. Read the rules. Closed it. Traded it away. The game described sounded clever enough, something like running three parallel games of Tigris and Euphrates where moves in one game echoed in the others. I'm sure this would reward those players who really like to immerse themselves in a complex system but to me it felt like hard work for not a lot of fun.

Some interesting ideas, but it doesn't excite me.  Building in the Age of Religion seems too risky for a meager 1 ecu bonus, so most people build in the Age of Might.

Hmm. My most recent play of this game was far from satisfactory. 3 players, basically everything was locked up by the middle game, with the final three turns making little or no difference. The tight terrain, the restrictive upgrade rules, and the fact that there isn't a lot of churn - once a power base gets established, it's hard to even chip away at it - made the game feel stagnant and uninteresting. Not sure whether my initial few impressions or my last impression is correct, or if number if it's a better game with more players, or if the game is really just too opaque for its own good, but I'm leaning towards the game just not being as solid as it should be. Which is a shame; this is a fundamentally clever game. But I think despite its cleverness, it falls a bit short.
---
I still really like Khronos, but am willing to admit it's probably another of those games that I am doomed to like a lot more than anyone else (like El Capitan). Khronos is clever, unique, nicely thematic, and with a great early/middle/late game flow. The way the three ages are distinct yet interleaved is very clever and nicely-done.

As mentioned below, though, it can be a bit of a brain-burner and it's tough to intuit play. Some will be frustrated by the restrictions the 4-card hand puts on you when there is tons of stuff to be done. The variant which introduces drafting is scary - the game has a large enough potential for AP as it is - playing with a 5- or even 6-card hand, but eliminating the free discards, might be a better way to go.
---
I rather liked this one after one play. It's a brain-bender, though; beware of analysis paralysis. There are some gamers who will turn a round of this into a living nightmare. But I found the rippling tile-play, and the different dynamics of the different boards, quite clever and fun. With the strict turn limit, the length of the game felt right ... as long as people don't get too bogged down.

At the risk of harping on the analysis paralysis possibilities excessively, the game is unique enough that the first couple of rounds of grappling with what the heck is actually going on here is normal, and I'd expect to see discussion of the game rules and implications as players get a feel for the unusual mechanics. The game does have a learning curve. But at some point you have to say "OK, I basically get it,  now let's play", and not get too bogged down.

A solid game, but the cool time travel theme isn't as neat as I'd hoped.  It kind of seemed like a sort of T&E variant played on three separate boards, which works just fine, but wasn't all that exciting.  The game took nearly two hours, of which I only played about 15 minutes, so I'll warn NOT to play this with AP prone players (no offense to the guys I was playing with; you guys were a lot of fun!)!  My rating may go up if I ever play with a faster group who flies by the seat of their pants a little more, but I can't see myself wanting to play again.

Probably best played with 4 players, so that there are not enough time zones for all players.

Time travelling is inevitably complex - as it should be. Despite being a very complex game, it still plays fast and can be explained rather quickly. 

BIGGEST DRAWBACK: First, the box is HUGE and very difficult to store or transport. The game contains the rules in French, English and German, but the German translation is full of semantic errors. Obviously the translator knew well about languages, but has never played the game. Luckily, I understood enough French to make sense of it.

Khronos is an innovative tile-laying game, and it introduces a fairly novel idea through the use of the time theme in that if players place medium or large pieces on either of the early boards, then those buildings will "ripple" into the future.

The game basically works like this: each player starts the turn by drawing 4 cards. There are 3 different types of cards, and each card type corresponds to one of the three different building types. Buildings have different values in different eras (military ones important on board 1, civic on board 3, &c.) and they cost between 1 and 5 cards to erect (players can put down a size 1 building on one turn, and then, for instance, pay 2 more cards on a subsequent round to upgrade that to a level 3, &c.). As players start doing this Euphrat & Tigris style kingdoms start appearing. Unlike Euphrat, the conflicts in this game are fairly clean and straight forward, but the game still has some unique intrigue in the way the tiles ripple, and how that can cause conflicts, can break up areas, or otherwise influence the value of player's holdings.

Without going into the extremely long of it, I rate this good but not great because while the actual board play is very well-done the game is not as satisfying as it should be due to the way the designers chose to handle the cards. Essentially, the cards drive almost everything you want to do (there is also a money economy, but that is more controllable). The problem is that you have no way to hold cards over to a future round, and that makes planning ahead, or setting up a crafty powerplay almost impossible. One round, for instance, I was basically hamstrung into making a very powerful play 1 round BEFORE the scoring round occurred just because the cards to pull it off showed up in my hand. It was stupid in that my opponent then had a chance to counter it because she had the right cards, but it was intelligent given my lack of ability to control the cards that I was going to be seeing. I think by adding some sort of variant to fix this problem, the game has real potential though, because the game play beyond the cards is nice and fits together well.

One other thing: people who are complaining about the quality of the components on this game are really picking at nits. A couple of the cubes might have needed a light shave with a sander, but the overall quality of the components for a first time effort was phenomenal. I imagine that if this were picked up by a bigger publisher then the cost would be much lower because there really aren't that many bits in the box, but I don't think the publishers were trying to rip people off with the price of this by any means, because I'm sure that the price for the small run they made must have been quite high per piece.

Anyway, interesting new game, and good in spite of the problem highlighted above with the cards. With a fix to that this could move up in rating for me.

One of the very few games to bore me to tears. Unintuitive play, a theme that does not even make sense mechanically (why do I get more money for building in the Renaissance age? Why can't I even build in the modern age?), and various arbitrary rules made this a pain to sit through. To add insult to injury, the downtime is just ludicrous. When a game with seven turns takes two hours, there's a fifteen minute wait between turns, and that's a sign you're doing something wrong. A shame, because I adore all things time travel and really wanted to like this.

RATING: 5
So, after a disastrous first game with 2 players where I ignored the cards for the most part, I was able to sit down with 3 players and try again. I must say that things improved considerably if you're not jumping around like a flea, and instead try and make do with your cards. [i]Then[/i] the game shows what it's capable of, and that is indeed quite a lot. Khronos is gruesome to teach because it requires you to memorise all the rules in advance, but once you play a few turns, most rules fall into place, and you can begin hunting around for agressive combos to knock your opponents down. The flash tutorial does a good job of presenting a few of the tactics you can employ—in fact, more than I expected because of the way it demonstrates the use of the demolishment of smaller buildings. This is a fun part of the game: setting up a domino scheme, topple the first one, and watch the rules take care of the rest.

That attempt with 3 players was relatively quick and painless; the fact that your hand limits your actions sees to this. Unfortunately, it can also limit you too much: the examples of the demo also illustrate this implicitly, for if you didn't have the right cards, then the beautiful tactics are simply not possible. I consider the rules variant in the 2nd edition rules with an open card draw set a must if you want to have some competitive play. It doesn't stop there, though. The game is also highly tactical in nature. You cannot plan your move for the next turn as the board will have changed too much, let alone that you have your cards already. I expect this game will not be much fun when played with 5: too much downtime, too much salvaging what you can, too much opportunism. Why on Earth it was marketed as such is beyond me.

If you can live with these disadvantages, then a fun game remains, if only because of the original 'time rippling' mechanic. I hope it will see more play in the future.

[b]Update[/b] The random card draw always turns out to be next to crippling from some point onward. Since you don't don't draw cards often (as opposed to other tile laying games with a random draw like T&E or Reef Encounter), the variance in what you draw is unacceptably high. Regrettably there is no easy way (read, implementable without altering the rest of the game) to houserule this problem out of existence, with the consequence that this game has been gathering dust since. Too bad, this is an elementary design error which could have been avoided.

[b]Update 2[/b] Bitten the bullet and let this game go. I think I gave the game sufficient opportunity (about a dozen games in total) to show what it was capable of, and it was always lackluster. Really, really too bad.

Once you read through the rules a few times and go through the online tutorial you'll be rewarded with a masterful game that will have you thinking. The intricate rules are confusing at first, but soon become clear. It reminds me of learning Tigris and Euphrates for the first time. 

The components are great - the board is easy to follow, the cards are big and the tiles are thick. Overall it's a nice looking game. The rules are detailed and clear and provide helpful examples. Once you "get it" the strategy is fun.

A very clever positional abstract with effects that ripple across time (different boards). I suspect it needs a compliment of 3 or 4 players who have all played the game several times before it really starts to shine. The concern would be whether you can get the game to the table often enough to achieve that given how difficult it is to teach and get your head round at first.

The changes associated with the 2nd edition all seem sensible/necessary.

One play.  We abandoned our effort after 2 hours in.  We were only on turn 4.  Do not play this game with anyone AP prone.  If you must, definitely institute a sand-timer.  There are many options for tile placement.  You could spend 15 minutes/turn trying to max/min your actions (and this did happen).  Because the game length says 90 minutes, this is obviously not how the game should be played.  And at 2 hours (half-way through), the game wore out its welcome.  It's a shame, because the game has potential.  The rating is symbolic of my willingness to play again.  I could only be convinced to play either with a fast group or with a sandtimer.

RATING: 6
Players are time travelers, trying to construct and control buildings that will generate income.  Players take turns moving their two time travelers to an epoch of time - the Age of Might, Faith or Reason.  Once their, they can play cards to construct, upgrade or destroy buildings.  What they do has the potential to "ripple" forwards in time.  What this means in terms of game play is there are actually three game boards, each representing the same area but at a different point in time.  Control of a particular type of building at a certain point in time (i.e. on a particular game board) can generate you income at the end of turns 4 or 7.  Income can be spent on game actions, or saved as victory points.  Confusing game, almost impossible to teach, that requires a quality play aid to lay it out all for the players.  Once you crack it, it's not a difficult game to play, but strategy is dictated a lot on your mini-hand of 4 cards.

Forget about Time Travel theme - what this is is "Euphrates and Tigris" in 3 dimensions. Even though the rules are ambiguous in places this is an enjoyable game, even though you basically only have 7 chances to do something. The game board constantly changes and other players mess up with your plans. The beauty is though that you can always score points in many different way, so even as your plans are smashed something new might open up in the future for example that will reap even more points. An interesting game.

I have not played another game where building in earlier times is mirrored in later times, and where building in earlier times can rewrite history, and destroy what is built in later times.  A very complex game that smacks of Tigris & Euphrates but with more depth. Also very clever that castles become ruins in later times and must be reconstructed for scoring.  Attacking can be done on any of the 3 time levels, and of course the earlier in time it is done, the farther the ripple of events occurs.  I think the BGG rating for this game is extremely low at the present 6.8.  It is original, pretty, and complex with numerous ways to mess with others.  With 5 players it takes longer than an hour.

RATING: 7
I will review my rating after I've played this a few more times.  The reason is I'm not too sure I grasp the different subtleties in this game.  I made some rather idiotic moves at first: enlarging cities in the civic era without populating the cities with my own cubes which gave other players the chance of taking advantage of the extra space; and building in the religious era a building which, of course, immediately got obliterated by a ripple of a large building from the military era.  I won't make those mistakes again and I'ld like to see how that affects my appreciation of the game once I don't play like a dweeb.

I'm finding there's not much you can do that is controlled, and that the game suffers from being too clever and convoluted for its own good.

It had been years since I played.  It was better than I remembered and exactly the game I wanted it to be!  The rules are a bit tricky but I did decently teaching it and it worked great.  The "Hold 'Em" optional rule is a MUST; the game is far too driven by chance without it.  A bit of city building, a bit of area control, and plenty of weirdness of how things ripple through time: that sums to a mighty good game!  It's VERY thinky, though, so 3P is likely the sweet spot to keep downtime tolerable, minimize the chaos between turns, and allow for some planning.  So good!

Very good gamer's game and a true brain burner! A bit reminiscent of "Tigris & Euphrates", but a lot easier for the players to adapt to luck of the draw, since it does not suffer from certain types of buildings being clearly more or less powerful than others. Sure, luck is still present, and there is no incentive to frequent time traveling, but I haven't found any major flaws. The time rippling effect and time paradoxes are very nice and highly thematic mechanics.

I bought the game ages ago, but finally played it a couple of times.

This is (one of) the most misunderstood game on the geek. You just need to read the comments and look at the ratings they gave to see that most ppl were too dumb for it.

Some ppl say they didn't understand it, but give a bad rating nonetheless. Another guy wrote that there's no interaction in this game (just wow!). Actually this is all about interaction! I'm really wondering if any of them ever played the game...

Lets leave the dumb behind.

This game isn't the best game in the world, but it has a extremely cool and unique idea that has been implemented very well. Given, the rulebook may not be the best, but we have the geek and the publisher got a video that explains most of the stuff and to be honest, it's not that hard anyway. I have no clue why most ppl didn't understand the game, while there are many more complicated games with more rules out there.

It reminds me of "Tigris & Euphrates" (great game) with even more options. There's so much going on and you will probably never grasp all the options you have unless you spend 10 minutes a turn. That said, I guess this could be frustrating with AP prone players, but if you take your turns in a normal manner, it's actually a pretty short game (just 7 rounds!). The box says 90 minutes and that's pretty accurate, even with 4 ppl and will be even less with fewer.

Great and completely misunderstood game!

Marries together one gaming concept I really enjoy - time travel - with one I can barely stand - building. In theory, the mechanisms are fascinating and quite cool (and maybe even "logical," in as much as anything about time travel can be), but learning and then playing the game is incredibly cumbersome. The board and tiles are quite nice; it's a shame the "pawns" are typical Euro cylanders.

Khronos is a game I want to love dearly as it has all of the elements of a great game. However, my first play left me wondering if the game is an excellent idea in theory or if it is one that stands in practice. As this is clearly a game that requires multiple plays to be familiarize oneself with the structure, I'll have to play more to find out. 

Nonetheless, here are my initial thoughts:
[b]First[/b], Khronos is a clever mix that is one part Tigris and Euphrates and one part Reef Encounter (and one part time travel which I get to in the next point). By this, I mean that it shares the common DNA that is Acquire in the tile-laying stock-game with volatile economy through spatial placement, mergers, and shifting valuations of the two games -- and manages to fall somewhere in between T&E's suddenness (and making the most of your hand) and RE's high strategy with little space to bluff. 

[b]Second[/b], the time travel mechanic is absolutely brilliant. For every major building to have ripples into the future which comes to effect future times is brilliant (and potentially destructive). This, in short, entails the possibility of producing temporal paradoxes through which buildings never come to have been amongst other scenarios.

[b]Third[/b], if the online tutorial is anything to show for the game, it is a space of creative dickery in terms of applying the two simple constraints (somewhat equivalent to the conditions for internal and external conflicts) to good use. What's more is that the hand you get is productively limiting in terms of what you can do -- 4 cards, 4 actions (and you work with what you've got, or spend 2 coins to change your hand).

However, I haven't seen a lot of this yet -- and I blame my inexperience at this point in time (i.e., my own play so far saw the board lock up in ways in which I could not tactically address). I foresee that this game will either rise to an 8 or 9, or sink further.

RATING: 6
A very clever idea that turned out to be an extremely frustrating game. This gets a 6 because I like the concept so much that I want to give it another try at some point. I have to admit I don't hold out much hope of it improving though.

Played at Gen Con.  Perhaps the definitive example of good design, bad development.  The concept of the board changing for subsequent eras was really cool.  But the game play was too tug-of-war and just not anywhere as interesting as at first blush.  Simply no replay value either.  Disappointing.

RATING: 6
I thought the time travel theme would be neat, but I find myself hesitant to bring this to the table.  I find it very frustrating to explain the rules, because this game is not intuitive to me.  All this temporal mechanics makes my head spin. There is a profound game in here somewhere, if I can only get past the "I think we're playing this wrong" feeling, despite the relatively simple game mechanics.

Update (01/20/12): Enough time has passed that I think I'm ready to try this again (coming up on 3.5 years). It's not that hard compared to other heavier games that I've been playing. I think I was initially disappointed because I was expecting some cool time travel game with time machines and stuff like that. Buildings that you build in the first age can grow in the second and third age. However, if a building is destroyed in the first or second age, it disappears in the subsequent ages. That all makes sense, but the play of the cards was very simplistic.

I only got to play this with 5, and I thought it was too long for a fairly light and random game.  It felt like playing an odd version of T&E on 3 boards where there was muted link between one board and another.

RATING: 5
An attempt to create a three-dimensional version of Tigris and Euphrates that simply serves to illustrate what a specialised skill game design is. Some good ideas are in evidence, but the card mechanism is too restrictive, it has analysis paralysis by the bucketload and the results of your move are about as easy to predict as those of real time travel. I won my first game, but felt I'd contributed nothing to my victory as I'd dominated the third age and waited for others to build to my benefit. Oh, and those wooden pieces are crude enough to have been sawn from broom handles.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This can get very confusing very quickly; it's important to check the entire board for results of moves that players can make and if you mess up a rule, it can be difficult to fix.  I love the idea of a time travel game and I like some of the things the designers are working with here, but I'd highly recommend having an experienced player with you when you play it.  (1 play)

Based on one play, this game is very hard to rate.

I'd like to try it again . . . now that I've seen the game play out.  The theme and mechanics are unique (which I always like); however, some of the rules (e.g., propagating building forward in time) take a play (or more) to really see how they affect the game.

A solid bit of entertainment.  Some folks in our group had difficulty getting their head around the rules.

I would call it the best implementation of time effects yet seen, but that is a pool of not very distinguished games.

It's like cross between Salmanca and Tigris & Euphrat with added one dimension - time.  This is definitely very tactical (probably too much for my taste), but I see it interesting (at least for now).

Chaotic and frustrating. The time-travel ripple mechanic and the different ways of scoring are great. Too bad they're used in a game where (with five, at least) the board situation is so incredibly fluid that advance planning seems pointless. I'd try again with three players, I guess.

Initial Rating: 7.5 (June 2011)

I was a little wary of the game. I´ve heard it was very very hard to play it. Althought it has a somewhat complex strategy, I found it wasn´t as hard as I previously thought It would be. I liked the game a lot. Maybe if we played with the variant of keeping cards on hand I would like it better. I can´t help but compare it to Tigris and Eufrates, as both games have and resolve conflicts in a similar fashion.  

As of right now (2011-06-18) I feel that MAYBE the player order gives an unfair advantage to the first player (in the score rounds) so the last player gets screwed. I have to play again to review this point.

It’s been years since I last played Khronos. I’m sad that I don’t remember much about it, so for now I’m downgrading its rating so my desire to play the game matches the BGG recommended rating system. I’m pretty sure I will play it again soon because I recently bought a new copy of the game.

Mind blower.  This game has a lot of things going on that you have to keep track of, this is why I like it.  At first the concept of the game seems easy but as the game progresses it becomes harder to determine what would be a good play to generate the most points for you in the 4 and 7 rounds.

Need to play again to really get a grasp of what is going on, rules are pretty well written in my perspective just a lot of information to wrap you head around which can easily get you confused and make the assumption that the rules were written terribly.  Try the Optional rules, this will make your decision of purchasing cards at the begining of your turn less frustrating, because throwing away some cards and spending 2 Eucs to buy those cards from the draw pile just to get more cards you don't need is hard to swallow.

The rules are too complex, and counter-intuitive.
Despite that it could be a very nice game,
But it just didn't flow (that might go away with more plays).

RATING: 8
I'm a bit of a sucker for a game with fresh mechanics that uses them effectively with the theme and Khronos is a fine example of this. The game is hard to grasp on a first play. There is certainly a curve. BUT, despite what some reviewers have said, the building rules and rippling effects all make perfect sense - once you have grasped the complete picture. What you are left with is a game where you directly build on one board to indirectly build on other boards that [i]score differently[/i]. So you need to figure out how to maximize scoring in three locations with a single tile placement. Not all buildings ripple forward and the rippling effect can potentially be blocked, creating a unique arrangement and dymanic on every board. 

This a brain burner in the very best sense in that it rewards creative placements and planning ahead. It is as much about limiting the other players' options as expanding your own. The Rio Grande production is spectacular. If you like challenging games and don't mind the tactical aspect of card play (which does limit your options), then you owe it to yourself to check this one out.

UPDATE: Played again after a few years. I still really love the key mechanics of this game. There is nothing like it. The card draw, with the optional rule in effect, does not bother me. However, you cannot - CANNOT - play this game without a table full of strong, spacially-oriented game players who really grok the mechanics at play. I suspect a game of 4 with everyone having a fine understanding and appreciation for how this works, would be amazing. I don't have that. And if someone does not grok the game or is not spacially-oriented, then this game quickly becomes anti-fun. I don't think I have the full table of players to appreciate this, so I will reluctantly let it go...  Keeping the score what it is though. VERY creative title.

A TIME TRAVEL GAME!  How cool is that!  It's sure to be a winner--right!?  Wrong!  I wanted this game to be awesome!  I usually find games that others hate to be cool in one way or another but this wasn't one of them.  To be fair, there are cool concepts to the game (like the "ripple effect" into the other epoch boards) but not enough to make my gaming group want to play it again.  The winner of the game won by a very wide margine in coins compared to the rest of us & should have been a very proud "TimeLord", but the look of diappointment on his face said it all--finding the win to be very unsatisfying.  I believe the game could be better with only two-players & excluding the 2-3 player rule restrictions.  Will I play it again?  I don't know.  & that's not a good sign.

An interesting idea for a game that I think would improve with further play.  Unfortunately I don't know how often I'd be able to get this one to the table.  At least initially, you need to be very careful that none of the rules are broken during building, which is harder than it sounds.  In our game, one player built a huge kingdom that was impossible to break up and he dominated the game.  Something about it didn't seem right.

Somewhat Tigris-like tile-laying game where some actions propagate through "time" on the three board segments. Similarities extend to initial nebulosity, kingmaking potential, and luck of the draw - critically so in the scoring rounds when you want [i]just[/i] the right cards on hand, with redrawing being another complete gamble. Since players are encouraged to lock in their spheres of interest, some areas can become undercontested, so the game may be best with the full five. The deck should have been bigger and the box should have been smaller.

The basic concept of time travel and propagating the effects from one of the three boards to the others is simply brilliant and very intriguing.

Needs more play to get a more firm grip and appreciation.

First of all, my rating isn't fair enough: I've played Khronos only once and with wrong rules - so the experience will be different next time. For what I've seen so far, is that this game has some unique elements, but some of them are a little bit complicated (three boards and you need to fix them all if you make any changes for one of them). And I found, that it's hard to realize, what you need to do on your turn...

I don't like the fact tha you have to play on 3 board at the same time. The game is also short in amount of turns giving you little amount of time to play fully on all boards.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Interesting game where tiles play forward in time (but not backward).  Some stirrings of Tigris and Euphrates in tile play and conflict.  On the first two boards (might and faith) one can only cause conflict on their initial placement via placing blue civil buildings which no one owns but provides points in the first two boards.  I found the gameplay pretty straightforward although it proved difficult to wrap one's mind around with the little niggly details that come into play for placement and rippling forward rules.  This game is generally very tactical due to the nature of dependence on the random card draw.  While you can pay 2 ecru to discard and draw new cards, I'm not sure that improves the issues much when your long range goals don't mesh with your draw of cards.  A second play made me more frustrated with this game...I'm about done with this game although I want to give it one more shot since I love the concept of the game if not the functionality.  Its generally not a good thing when you enjoyed your wrong way of playing better than the correct way of playing!  As well, I'm not sure I want to play this game with anyone who is AP prone since there is often quite a bit to work through on a potential turn seeing how different plays will ripple through time and effect potential scoring.

RATING: 8
The game mechanics transport the theme of time traveling elegantly, propagating the effects from one epoch to future epochs (3 epochs all together on the game board, each of which is represented by a map of the same region). Considering all effects of ones move and deciding on which is the optimum move can get quite complex and is sometimes a bit of a brain burner. 
Only downsides: luck in card draw can be decisive for winning the game and makes long term planning difficult.

This is a fantastic game. It is the only time-travel game that I felt like I was time-travelling. The things you build early on show up as ruined versions in the later time periods, so it feels like the same place, but more crumbly and sparse as "time" has worn it out. Things built early in the time stream usually trump things built later on, but you can end up with paradoxes where people try to build things in the same places, but different eras. As the game plays out, you can build forward and backward and your buildings cause things to change, shifting other time periods in subtle and differing ways due to the rules of time propagation.

The rules are amazingly simple and I had no difficulty playing through each turn. The rules for propagation and splitting/joining areas are slightly complex but fairly intuitive. Every once in a while, there is an edge case that needs to be referenced from the rules. Ultimately, you need to play it once through to understand the ramifications of your actions and how to get points from scoring, but it is a blast discovering it!

Warning: I can see this game being one that can be AP'ed to death, so don't let those kinds of people play this with you!

This is a tremendous game. As a work of visual art it's absolutely stunning; the board, cards, illustrated tiles, and worker pieces exhibit an attention to detail and a unity of vision that one hardly ever sees in even the fanciest FF games. It's a tactical brain-burner, and at first feels far too abstract for the theme - the rather muddled and structureless rulebook admittedly doesn't help in this regard. But this appearance of themelessness is actually an illusion; the ways that the game gets scored and the peculiar rules for building construction and alteration through time in truth represent a rather profound meditation on the nature of historical change, and the differences between ages of Might, Religion, and Reason.

I would love to rate this a ten, but the rules make it so difficult to figure out what is essentially a fairly easy game, and that holds me back. I had to read them through several times before I began to grasp it, and then could only "see" how things worked during an actual game. Even then we missed a lot. By the third game we had it down, and the fluidity of the board is amazing. The 'ripple' effect of the different boards is the most unique mechanic I've ever seen. The only real drawbacks to the game are the confusing rules and the inevitable analysis paralysis.  We play with a timer to keep game time down.  This scores high with just about everyone I've played it with. Its length will probably keep it out of regular rotation, but I can't see this one ever getting ignored entirely.

Gave my copy away before ever playing the game - then I was asked to proof-read the German rules for the second edition (the German first edition rules were a total mess) and decided to build my own copy from scratch to check how everything worked - and I must say: a really challenging and fine game (at least for two or three players - downtime and tactical options will become seriously problematic for more, I might think, but I have to verify that) - definitely not a game to play with Analysis Paralysis types.

Update: Own a 2nd edition copy now - and, wow, are the components good!

Like it. It's a pretty fast and not so easy game. Plays well with 2 and 3, I like it best with 4. Probably too chaotic with 5.

I have the 2nd edition, so I really don't understand what all the fuzz about unclear rules is about. I find the rules pretty easy and straightforward.

I bought this game on a whim, it seemed promising but failed to deliver. The winner seemed a bit random, with the effects rippling through the time zones it was too hard to make any plans or long term aims.

Intriguing idea that has players placing tiles and then try to score them on 3 different time plains.  Buildings expand or are destroyed during the ripples.  You can conquer other tiles using T&E mechanics.  One big issue, for me, was the small hand of cards that determined your fate.  It seemed too tactical for what seems should be a more strategic game.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Many appealing aspects like the setting/mood, the three time planes, the components, and the basic interaction of this done in different planes.

What breaks it for me are the convoluted rules that regulate largest buildings per color in each component and the annoying ways that they intersect with rippling stuff through time. I cannot imagine that there is much strategy or tactics to be applied, seems more like greedy what is best right now. (Assuming you even understand the effect of your move, or what the currently best move would be.)

Good time "travel" game, but feels like something is missing that would make it a great game.  This is a beautiful game with great bits and colorful board. It also succeeds at introducing a novel way to simulate time travel effects. As a time travel game it is one of the best; however, overall, it is just a good game.

RATING: 4
My rating isn't a serious one--I've "played" this game twice in the sense of beginning and ending it and moving stuff about the board, but never felt that I had much grasp on the (confusing) rules, let alone strategy. Given the obvious problems with the game (notably, the high luck factor in card draws), there basically there seems to be no pressing reason to put the considerable time/effort to learn and get good at it, especially as you're not likely to encounter many other players of the game. Also, why not just play Tigris & Euphrates?

It's online at Boardgame Arena, if you feel like giving it a shot before tracking down an O/P copy.

After one play, this is not as "brain buring" as I had expected. Admittedly the rules were consulted regularly during the game, but the basicv premise of using only 4 cards per turn is straight-forward.With only 2 scoring rounds and only 7 rounds to a game, this should complete quickly and as the buidlings are constructed keeep players interested throughout the game.
One for the hardened gamer though!

It's rare that I rate a game so highly after just a single play, but this is a great concept, challenging play, has hidden depth and re-play value and it left me wanting to play more.  I expect the rating may rise after more plays.  Great game.

File under "one trick pony".  The cool idea here -- events in the past rippling into the future -- loses a whole lot of coolness when you have to wait 20 minutes for your next turn, with little ability to plan ahead and even less to react while your opponents lay waste to your work and each other's.  The headache factor is increased by the rules of dominion and hierarchy (they're easy to forget), and you can barely do anything worthwhile if you get dealt all three colors, which can happen A LOT.  Khronos has a neat gimmick that was thrust into a lousy game structure, and I will not subject myself to it again.

RATING: 7
(First impression: 4 players)
We played with a variant that you can swap cards between hand and 3 cards showing. You can only take one colored cards but can put anything back. I really would recommend this. It feels to dramatically reduce amount of luck with cards.

Because of 3 boards that have interaction between them it can be confusing in the first game. All of the rules about buildings moving "through time" (to other boards) are logical but it took me the first game to really get how they should be used. I definitely want to try again as I think the second game easily could give a better impression about the game.

I think biggest issue in the game is that with 4 players it's already quite chaotic but with 3 there might be too few buildings even if it might be better control-wise. 5 players is too much for it for sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A very good building game. The time rippling mechanism is very nice. The rules look much more complex than what the game actually is [edit: especially since the second edition rules are a lot clearer], meaning there's surprisingly little analysis paralysis. At least until the endgame.

The card management (of which there isn't any) sucks. Let's hope they'll fix that in the second edition [edit: ok, there is an optional rule now, but even that does not completely fix the issue]. Also, the deck is too small, so you have to reshuffle it all the time. The second edition fixes this problem, though.

Exceptional artwork, especially since the game comes from a new, tiny publisher. The box is ridiculously oversized. Also, the original 50 EUR price was outrageous. A must buy if it ever comes in a smaller box, and with a more reasonable price tag.

A more complex and convultuted Tigris and Euphraties but without the ebb and flow, designed around a theme which might as well not be there - which is a shame as the theme has potential. I do like the idea of the ripple effect, but in the end it all seems too much hard work for too little reward.

Weird game with a neat idea that suffers from a terrible rule book. Also, AP can be a problem, because actions depend on what your neighbour to the right does, and thus can hardly be planned ahead, while optimal moves need careful consideration. Anyway, it presents a good mixture of bashing and tactical thinking. It feels like Tigrius and Euphrates, but in 3d, while the luck factor is larger.

A fantastic game with incredibly deep and complex strategy. The learning curve is extremely high, so a big no no for occasional gamers and newcomers. This is a very high standard gamers game! The time travel idea is fantastic and extremely well implemented, also makes for very hard nail-bighting decisions.

In my collections, this is by far the most difficult game to learn, play, master and teach, but it's worth the effort.

- A negative remark though goes for the rulebook, which is somewhat confusing and would have been great if a player aid would have been included, summarising all the rules.

RATING: 7
This game feels somewhat like Tigris & Euphrates in that you're placing tiles on a grid, to form groups of tiles owned by a particular player for a number of colors.  However, it is significantly more trippy: there are actually three grids, representing different points in time, and actions taken in previous time periods "ripple forward" into boards representing future time periods.  Additionally, placement of tiles in the past can create temporal paradoxes in the future, meaning that tiles on those boards can cease to exist.  It's quite difficult to wrap your head around the intricacies of the rules (let alone teaching), but once you do, it's fun, in a brain-burner-y way.

1 play, 5 player, 15 minutes/playerThe game plays fairly quickly. The ripple effect, time travelor pieces, and scoring mechanisms are very well done. The rule book is a bit obtuse but once digested, the game progresses well. Good balance of choices and actions with plenty to think about between turns. The cards are too few causing a very frequent reshuffle (twice a round in five player). Given the cards have just 3 values (might, religeon, and reason) and must be replaced each turn, perhaps four dice would suffice for the entire card set (each color twice per die). Will definately play again.

RATING: 7.5
UPDATE: After playing this game again with finally (I hope) the right rule interpretation, here are some updated observations:

1. This game is a bit too light for how heavy the ruleset is. The number of construction cards you get per turn, only four, really limits what you can do. What also limits you is the Rule of Hierarchy, in which you can't simply build a large building and try to fight for control over a domain. Simply put, there are some domains that you cannot win ever. But because the game is quite short: only seven turns, this *should* be expected.

2. The luck factor is quite significant. Compare this to Tigris and Euphrates. In E&T, you have a lot of turns, and a lot of tile drawing. Because you have so many turns, the luck of the draw eventually balances out. In Khronos, there are only seven turns per player, So getting burnt with one or two hands of cards will really screw you over.

3. The rules are badly organized. A game with very original mechanisms requires well presented rules.

4. I think the Age of Reason board is for the desperate player who gets shut out of the other boards. If you have to put cubes there, then you probably do not have a good chance of winning. However, I haven't played this game enough; I've never seen a player try to focus on this board instead.

In summary, this is a weird monster of a game: it has very unusual and complex mechanisms, but the game itself is very, very light in relation because of (a) limited choices of what to do because of the construction cards and (b) the board fills up fast with tiles since the tiles themselves take up so much space on the board and have a lot of rules that limit their placement -- meaning that there's really not that much choice to where to place tiles.

====

In response to some of the negative comments: I have the Rio Grande edition, and I think the negative comments are from an older edition with a worse set of rules.

1. I don't see why people are experiencing a lot of downtime in this game. Your turns are limited to playing four cards, and there are only three kind of cards in the deck.

2. The luck factor is not as significant as many claim. You can always exchange your cards, and the cost in points isn't that significant. I think you have to follow a flexible strategy that can accommodate any mix of cards. And if the luck factor still irritates you, the Rio Grande version comes with a card drafting variant.

3. The rules are quite straightforward and intuitive; I managed to teach this to a 10-year-old. BTW, I think Tigris and Euphrates far less intuitive than this one. As a matter of fact, I think this game feels like 3D T&E, light.

4. Some complained that you don't get to move adventurers back and forth in time enough. The game itself is only seven rounds -- you only have seven turns and so you shouldn't be moving them much. 

I do have some issues though that I hope will be resolved with further play (which I'm wary of because my gaming group gave this game a lukewarm reception):

1. Is the Age of Reason board worth investing in? There seems less points up for grabs there compared to the other boards, but it requires less resources to gain the points there.

2. I like the fixed hand size and the fixed number of rounds since it keeps the game moving at a good pace. However, I think this might limit the strategic depth of the game. You only have four turns to create a good scoring position for yourself. 

I don't mind this -- lack of strategic depth -- since Khronos offers tactical richness -- the dimensions of the playing grid are huge. What I do mind is that this game is too fiddly considering how [i]light[/i] it is.

Summary: I think this is a try-before-you-buy purchase. I think it's too light for T&E fans, but a bit too fiddly for those who adore Ticket to Ride. However, your TtR fans should be able to easily understand the rules for this one.

A fascinating game.  Flavors of Tigris & Euphrates (mostly in the city building limitations and combinations), but a fairly unique game with intriguing possibilities.  However, it's also fairly quick, turn limited, and true strategy is constricted by the luck of the card draw.  Turn order also seems to have awkward and limiting implications on the game.  However, it's fun and has quite a bit of potential (future plays could easily raise or sink my view of this game.).

An extremely balanced and intelligent game. Love the way buildings ripple through time and affect scoring. The very definition of a brain burner game, as there is SO much to keep track of.Knowing when to abandon an age in favor of one less fought over seems to be the key. Could be one of my top 10 games after another play or two.

This is also a great example of how a euro game can have a heavy theme.

Khronos has very unintuitive mechanics which means that you will forget most of the tricky situations after some time and struggle with rules mistakes during the game. With four or more players there is a big possibility for chaos and lack of control. The game has a huge AP-potential and with more than three players and situations can change quite dramatically. The game is relatively short to amount of things happening in the game. Only two scorings is far too punishing system and it's quite hard to recover after a bad start. The effort vs. playing time is highly questionable, especially if you consider the amount of randomness and lack of control in the card draw. Use some variant rule to have available face up cards. The game is all about getting lucky with your draws. Discarding hand with 2 money is also far too luck driven and often useless action. With 2-3 players it's a fairly nice game since it's quite short (45-60 min) and there is more control in the game. Yet, after each game there is stronger and stronger feeling that this game doesn't have very much to offer in the long run.

Although not a terribly difficult, this game has a steep learning curve. It is best taught in two parts: first how domains battle on a single board, then how the time travel element works. The way that the game's two core rules (the rule of dominion and the rule of hierarchy) applies to the three time locations, and to temporal paradoxes and other situations created by time travel, seem complex and fiddly at first, but makes perfect sense in actual play. Once you have the rules down (really only takes a few turns), what's revealed is a novel, somewhat abstract area control game fought in three linked locations. Turns are optimization puzzles. Recommended.

OMSCHRIJVING: Strategisch area-control spel met fantasy-thema.
Het spel speelt zich gelijktijdig in 3 tijdsperken af: De Middeleeuwen, de Renaissance en de Moderne tijd. De spelers zijn machtige heersers die door de tijd kunnen reizen en in de verschillende tijdperken gebouwen oprichten en deze trachten te controleren. Maar opgelet: Wat je in het verleden verandert, heeft belangrijke gevolgen in de toekomst! Daarenboven hecht elk tijdperk niet evenveel waarde aan de diverse gebouwtypes: militaire gebouwen zijn belangrijker in de Middeleeuwen, in de Renaissance worden religieuze gebouwen meer naar waarde geschat, terwijl civiele gebouwen in de Moderne tijd de voorkeur genieten.

rating after 2plays (both 2pl) - 7/8

i really like this so far - sure the rules are a bit tricky but i can't see why the rating is low yet and i think it would be very good with 3/4 players

it did seem to end way too quick with 2 players and felt like there should be another 3/4 rounds maybe

rating after 3rd play (3pl) - 6 and falling

ok now i see y this game is low rated - bad cards do u in, also sometime just too restrictive on what u can actually do (esp if u dont get blue cards) also it seems to heavily favour the last player come scoring. also just not much fun - i had hoped the complexity would lead to unfathomable depths but instead i think it just masks a poor game besides Tigris is similar and SOOOOO much better

Very interesting area control game in that points are scored in 3 areas by different means, but buildings in one area can cascade an impact into another.

The entire Age of Faith seems too risky to do more than dabble in (perhaps one should get three or four coins for building/upgrading there?).  It simply seems too easy for someone to come along, build/upgrade in the Age of Might, and mess with your plans.  Thus, it's no big deal to gain one fewer coin for building in the Age of Might, since you'll more than make up for it during the paydays.  The extra coin gained by building/upgrading in the Age of Faith is little consolation if you earn 5-10 coins less on payday.  

Furthermore, there's serious concern about how bad it is to go last.  Since each player scores after their own turn, the last player's position can be savaged by the time their turn comes around, leaving their planned scoring positions in tatters.  I'm not sure what good solution there is to this.

Bit of a struggle to get my head around how the game mechanics can be used to steer towards victory. I think it would come easier with more plays, but it's difficult to persuade my regular opponents to give a game another try when they spend a couple of hours without knowing what they are doing.

Here's where I have to give a game a slightly higher score than a strict reading of the guidelines allows. I think it's a very good game, but I doubt I would never turn down a game. You have to be in the mood for a slight brain burner to play this. Plus I imagine that downtime could get grim if you play with one of those groups that zips out a four hour game of Settlers.

The mechanics are clever and engaging. It's fun to strive toward the end-game board. And it's an overall nice looking game.

This game is not as difficult as the rules make it seem.

For 4 years I gotten stuck in them rules and got so confused I kept giving up on it.
Than finally I decided I really should make an effort and got dug in.

It's actually a fairly easy game and not bad, the unuall game mechanics make it interesting.

It's a shame they couldn't figure out how to explain this an easier way, or maybe it's just my way of thinking that made it seem one bungled web of confusion to me.

An interesting game that still feels not quite right, although that may change with more playings.  With the small hand limit there doesn't seem to be enough ability to effectively plan ahead and the fact that you have to pay 2 Ecus (which are VPs at the end of the game) make discarding at the beginning of your turn particularly painful.  Lots of good idea just needs something extra.

Slightly confusing, but once you get your head around what's going on you might find yourself enjoying it. I'd prefer to play with three for a quicker gaming experience. The open three card option might help with your options a bit, but it might also make the game drag a bit with more options available in your turn. Non confrontational hanging around in the corners and multiple areas of the board might be the best strategy here. Willing to explore further.

RATING: 7
Probably the best time travel game in existance, way ahead than [i]Railways Through Time[/i], the other contendant in the category that I've tried. It feels like [i]Tigris & Euphrates[/i] in 4D in terms of gameplay, appearance, mechanics and even scoring. The original part is that the board is divided in three maps that belongs to different time periods, so whatever you do in the the past will have effects in the future, time paradoxes included. The bad things: Everything is so tight that kingmaker situations may appear, the game has "analysis paralysis" written all over it,  the rules could be clearer about limit situations like ties in dominions and probably there is not enough motivation to move your time travellers frequently. Nevertheless, still a great game, one that claims a regular space in the table.

[Essen 2006]
Played a 4 player game where all of us were playing for the first time. This one is something of a brainburner. Took 40 minutes to read through and understand the rules. Game played in just under two hours on top of that. We missed the 'Rule of Hierarchy' once or twice - having several '1' buildings in the same domain with nothing bigger. Would definitely like to play this one again. Initial rating: 7.5

Update: Second game was 3-player. Played in 1 hour 10 minutes. Rating increased to 8.5. Really like this game. Yes, it is tough when you don't get the Construction Cards you want, but the challenge is to make the most of what you've been given. The other players are doing the same.

I figured that I'd have a hard time wrapping my head around this, I was right, but not for the reasons that I thought.  I was guessing that the ripple effect of the game would make it tough for me to figure out what was going on, but that was handled with such precision in the design that it was entirely clear of what would happen.  Bravo.

What was tough for me was scoring, turn after turn I just couldn't wrap my head around how to actually score.  Perhaps my crazy nights in my early 20's suddenly caught up with me, but I couldn't for the life of me figure out how to properly take my turn to do anything worthwhile.  First you get this wack card draw.  To use your draw efficiently you will have to split the cards between your two time travelers, but the value of the tiles encourages you to have your two time travelers together for more efficient play.  There is already a huge amount of luck of the draw to determine what your actions are, if you are split then you are absolutely depending on a worthwhile hand.  It cost two VPs for a redraw (which is ungodly expensive) so the person that gets the cards they need will be able to defend their cities and build what they like, and those that don't will sacrifice a worthwhile turn or pay valuable VPs hoping to get something to keep up with the joneses.  You should be able to draw again for 1 VP and 2 VP to draw any card you want.

Second, there I find it very difficult to unseat the large buildings, once someone has their foot in, it costs too much energy and risk in order to bump them.  The risk is really an issue as you can spend turns building up your buildings just to completely have them wiped out by the caprice of a player with an extra blue card that they don't know what else to do with.

Overall, I find that the game is a lot of work, for little reward with a somewhat intense E&T positioning that absolutely relies on good card draws.

Nice game but incredibly difficult to teach. The randomness of the cards can be a negative factor, as well, though I have a feeling that can be mitigated a little with more experience. The time travel feel is there, which is great, but if it weren't for that I'd probably find this game pretty boring.

The box for this game states: "2006 Les Editions du Matagot" and "2. Edition", and "Made in France" it also has the Rio Grande Games name and URL on the box.  The picture on the front looks like the 2006 version (with no frame).  My best guess is that it is 2006, 1st edition by Matagot despite the "2 Edition" and Rio Grande information.  

This is a pretty heavy game to ship in comparison to other games, so I'm more interested in local trades, unless the trader is willing to offset some of the shipping costs.

May have to move this one up to an 8.  The rules have a couple of nuances that it took some time for us to pick up on.  The theme is thin, but the three-dimensional conflict mechanic is very novel and makes for interesting decision-making.

UPDATE: Can't quite move this up to an 8, since I don't think it has tremendous depth, but once you've navigated the slightly complex rules, this plays in a decent length with some interesting decisions.

November 3, Lobster Trap '06. 1 PARTIAL game.

Another one getting a lot of Essen buzz. It's a really interesting idea: there are 3 boards representing 3 time periods (Age of Might, Age of Faith, Age of Reason). It's a Tigris and Euphrates sort of game, with the added effects of time - past events affect future ones. Players have 2 time-traveling workers who can move from age to age (costs VP). Each turn, they draw 4 cards randomly (orange, blue, or purple) (and can spend 2VP to discard/redraw). Each worker may use up to 2 cards.

This is a really cool idea that went over like a lead balloon! 5 of us (me, Mary, RichG, DavidA, KevinG) played this for just over an hour before calling it quits. We did play at least 1 rule incorrectly - we weren't discarding our hand at the end of each round - but no one seemed to be enjoying it. Like T&E, it seems like a pretty strategic game, but strategies are severely hampered by the luck of the card draw. It would likely be even worse if you couldn't even hold onto any cards at all between turns! Still, I'd like to give this one more try before a final verdict. For now, though, a 6/10.

RATING: 3
There are two main things I don't like about Khronos.  First, it reminds me too much of E&T, one of my least favorite games.  That's not a fault in design.  Rather, it's just a personal quirk.  Second, there is far too much downtime waiting for your turn.  I think this game lends itself to that even if the players are relatively fast.  Interesting concept though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
This game is an abstract game with a time travel gimmick.  I will give it credit for clever mechanics, the friend who owned this copy said he got it looking for a game with a real time travel feel and despite the very abstract nature of the gameplay I definitely think it delivered on that theme (as did he).

Each turn a player has a hand of four cards that each represent one of the three ages in time.  On your turn you can spend money to exchange some or all of these cards, travel (with one of your two pieces) to a different age, or discard cards to build, upgrade, demolish, or take control of different buildings.

When you take an action with a building it will "ripple" through time and this can have a lot of different effects and this part of the game can be quite fiddly and a little convoluted.  I had a hard time throughout almost the entire game really understanding the scoring rules or what exactly I should be doing and when and why I could and couldn't do some things over others.  It's not the most complicated or fiddly game I've played but the way it was presented made it harder for me than usual to grasp.

Like I said, despite being abstract the game delivers pretty well on theme.  It is also quite clever and mechanically sound (even if I didn't quite grasp it).  But in the end I think because it is a very abstract experience it just didn't do anything for me.  Also, the bits and board are very dull and sleepy looking with muted/faded colors and no real life or charm to them.

This game can have a serious problem with down time too.  Our game only took 90 minutes but it felt like 3 times as long because with 5 players I had nothing to do after my turn but just wait for it to come back around to me and other players turns can drag since it is very abstract, especially by the end of the game when the board is littered with different colored and sized tiles and you try to wrap your minds around how to get the most points to finish the game.  With so much changing it was rarely worth it to pay attention to any turn except the one right before mine since I had no control and things were just going to keep changing anyway.

Well designed game but with very little life that just doesn't appeal to my tastes anyway.

I also have the strange feeling that I've done something wrong. This feeling often happens because games are obtuse and that's what I'm "afraid" of.

A fine game, that is well designed,  the rules seem to be clear to me.  (second edition)  I enjoyed playing the game, it moved pretty fast, and plenty of decisions needed to made.  HOWEVER,  the time travel element isn't as cool as you might think,  Basically big buildings last a while, and go wild in modern times. I wish it were more clever,  but given the rules ambiguity the way it stands, I'm guessing this is about as complex as it can be done in a euro.

I really liked this one.  The rules are a little bit fiddly but after a short while they all make sense.  In other words, while they may be a little complex and seem arbitrary at first there are good reasons for all of them and after a play or two they become second nature.  There's a lot of room to try different strategies and although this kind of game could have a bit of a runaway leader problem, Khronos ends before it ever comes to that.

Two plays. Limiting the available actions by cardplay seems to polarise people. I find it an interesting challenge in it's own right, while others hate the way it seems to force tactical decisions every turn.

Seemed interesting, novel theme.

Unfortunately, it takes at LEAST 3 plays (if not more) to have everyone be fully aware of the different scoring rules. So in my opinion the rules get in the way of the game with their clunkyness. Completely impossible to play with non-gamers or even casual gamers.

The idea was nice but could have been executed better.

RATING: 6
Cravat: Single play. Very tactical.  I really like how the rippling affects the three boards.  An effect of the rippling is that it is difficult to benefit from one play on multiple boards.  If you can master that I think you will do well.  The reason it's tactical is because you get four new cards at the end of your turn and can't save any from the previous turn.  Also because you score with orange on one board, purple on the next and blue on the third, but can only score on two of the boards, you can definitely get cards that are not useful on the boards in which you are invested.  Paying 2 vp to draw again for another random crap shoot seems expensive in a 30-40 point game won by one point.  I think I would enjoy the game a lot more with a bit more choice in your card draw.  Draw 5 and play 4 or a Web of power/TtR hand refill or something.  Drawing blue early seemed weak and you need blue late for combat.  I was frustrated with my card draws in the first three turns of a 7 turn game.  Not a good start.  Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the experience and will play again, but I probably won't buy it. 2006/10/20

I had played this game when it first came out. I had only been playing games for a year then, so my view on board games was still very different. I rated it quite highly back then. Now, 8 years later, I decided to play it again so I could update my rating... and because I wanted to play it again :)
This game has an awesome concept with 3 time periods where actions in the past have effects in the future. Not many games do this for an obvious reason: it's quite complex and not easy to implement. This game does quite a good job of solving this problem. But it introduces other problems with the 3 building rules. Not that they are hard to understand, but it is just so damn easy to make mistakes that are almost impossible to undo when you find them out. With every building action, you should always have all players paying attention to make sure no rules where broken. We only had one mistake pop up in this last game and it ended up not impacting the final scoring, but still, it's an annoying element of this game.
This is not a bad game though, and it has a great concept behind it. Unfortunately the game does not live up to it's potential, it is merely OK.

One of the few games involving time traveling. Excellent game mechanisms, fast play although a lot of thinking can go into this game. The rules is a blessing and a curse. The rules need to be understood fully to play the game (there are some excellent player's aid in the file section). The rules are well written but you need to read them (this is not your average game rules that you will read casually). If you don;t understand the rules , you will make many mistakes and this mistakes will break the game and create a lot of paradoxes and unresolved situations. If you play by the rules , you will not get any inconsistent situations that are not covered by the rules. This is great game with very clever and well balanced mechanisms. Be prepared to understand the rules and you will be rewarded.

This is so much better than the BGG ratings suggest. This is probably because many people only play it once and therefore never get to grips with what is a very good game. My first play was slightly disappointing for both me and my opponent. But, having learnt from the first occasion what the game was about, we thoroughly enjoyed our second and subsequent games. I've now played it several times with 2, 3 and 5 players and it really is an excellent game, probably in my top five.

And don't be put off by those who say it's like T&E. It isn't - it's far better.

I really like the core mechanics of the buildings and how they are represented across time. However, the cardplay is poor and damages the game a great deal (even in the second edition, which is what I played). This could be ameliorated somewhat by giving players larger hands, but it would still be too random, and there are other issues - I don't think the scoring works too well.

Wonderful concept, mediocre game.  Take T&E and take away your ability to hold a hand of tiles.  You have to draw 4 any play them all.  Now add a bunch of building types where you have to have two identical cards to do anything and add a penalty for having to refresh your "hand".  The cool part where building in the past affects future boards does not make up for the frustration.

Definitely not to my taste.  The rest of the players I played with also seemed to find it pretty forgettable.  The time traveling is basically a thin theme to cover an abstract game that has three different boards that respond to each other in very specific ways.  The time travel theme makes you think it will be light, but the game is actually quite stodgy, and the abstruse scoring and building rules make it very tempting to overthink turns, which really bogs the game down.  It's one of those games that makes you feel like you need to keep looking for that perfect play, because although you've got a good play, there's probably an even better one.  Meanwhile, the other players at the table are thinking about what's for dinner, or their unaddressed paperwork at home, because their moves depend heavily on what you do, and planning ahead is quite difficult.

Very good, advanced, brain-burning, tile-laying game. A sort of three/four-dimensional Tigris & Euphrates across three different time epochs where major building construction and destruction ripples through time causing temporal paradoxes. A bit complex with lots of small rules and very AP-prone. I hate slow play but embarrassingly ground to a halt on my penultimate turn of my first play struggling even to find a meaningful, allowed action let alone a good one; resulting in a for me pointless, king-making, shit-stirring punt to make others fight and maybe leave scraps for me (which turned out fairly well, just stealing second place).

RATING: 5
Difficult game to rate after my first play. The thing is I really really like the concept AND to be fair I really enjoyed myself while playing too: the game is short enough to not outstay it's welcome but long enough to feel like something of substance happened. The issue I have with it is that the luck of the card draw seems to be more influential than your clever play. In fact, once your strategic position is established your allocation of resources is mostly obvious- at that point it just seems that you are hoping to draw the colors you need. The optional rule of having an exchange pile (which we used) doesn't seem to help enough. In fairness there are only three different colors in the deck so you'd think that the odds would be in your favor of drawing a color you need. Somehow however I managed to only draw a handful of blue cards the whole game- maybe this was a statistical anomaly but I can sure see that situation leaving a bitter taste in your mouth. In the end I actually won but I felt that it was largely from carelessness of my opponents who were engaged in a cold war against each other.

In this game, you play a powerful lord and his faithful companion engaged in a fight for influence throughout time. The game proceeds simultaneously over three different periods. You start the game in the Middle Ages, on the first of the three game boards (that of the commanderies). With 4 action cards in hand per turn, you have seven turns in which to develop your domains by building various types of military, civil and religious buildings. Depending on their size, certain buildings are moved in time, which means that they are transferred to the same place on the priories board (Renaissance period) and on the brotherhoods board (modern period), in ruins for military and religious buildings (castles, abbeys…)Thanks to the watch makers' invention and with enough money, you can make your two adventurer pawns travel in time… Because if the construction of certain buildings can be profitable, taking over domains on the various boards is essential since it will allow you to earn bonuses on the 4th and 7th turns and to move ahead of your opponents.Playing with time is not without consequences and can produce surprising results! To give just one example, an abbey created on the priories board could be destroyed by a castle built later in the game in the same place, but on the commanderies board, and then moved to the other board… The abbey finally never existed!On the 4th and 7th turns, each controlled domain generates profits for the players depending on the board. On the the commanderies board, a player who controls a domain militarily, i.e. the one with the biggest military building, will receive the value of the civil buildings in this domain in profits. On the priories board, it is the religious control which will be taken into account. On the brotherhoods board, the players who have best populated the civil buildings and restored the ruins will secure the best profits.The possibility of destroying and regrouping buildings to unite or divide domains provides a strong and permanent level of interaction between the players.

This is an area control game.  This game spans three boards and control is gained by spending cards and money.  Money is gained by building and at two scoring rounds.  Building in earlier boards affect later boards.  The game is that simple, but the eight-page rule-book makes it seem more convoluted.  I suggest downloading a player aid to help summarize the rules, and to keep handy when questions come up.  After one play of a three-player game, a simple strategy becomes apparent: dominate the first board and score a combination of the third board and either the first or second board.

This is a weird game.
I played the first few times, enjoyed it and thought "hey, interesting". Then it sat there for a while and I forgot the rules, so to speak.

When I explained the game to a new group of people a couple months later, it was like playing for the first time again. And I saw the game in a completely different light: it is awesome. This is THE love ir or leave it game, not even close to being enjoyable by most people, but I do like it.

I think its all about the competition. Depending on who you´re playing with, this can be a hell of a nice game.

RATING: 7
Somewhat interesting game. It's kind of a brain burner in a bad way, because the game state changes so much between turns that it's difficult to plan ahead. I also didn't like that you (essentially) can't save cards from one hand to the next; the rules say you can, but the only way to do that is by not playing cards, and in a game with only 7 turns, I can't fathom that being a winning strategy. We played with the official variant allowing a face-up card pool, and I still felt very limited by my hand in terms of what I could do. It's a very tactical game that feels like a strategic one. It's possible my rating could rise with more plays if there's more ability to plan ahead than I'm giving it credit for at the moment, but I'm also not in a hurry to seek it out.

The rules take a good deal of parsing, since they read a bit like a tutorial on writing an algorithm. The game is really much simpler than it seems on first glance.

Building cities in different eras of time is interesting, though the time travel mechanic doesn't seem to have a whole lot of relevance.

Once you get thro the rules you will see it is not so difficult after all. Love the art work, the theme is unusual and works well. Don't think I'd like to play with 5 as there would be too much downtime. Not all elements are used when only playing with 2 players. Thought it would be a brain burner but it is not - although there are lots of things to keep an eye on when it comes to decision making you only have 4 cards to use.

RATING: 6
We just didn't see the interest in this one.  The game creates more headaches than the fun it provides.  It isn't "hard" per se, it is just a pain to follow all of the building rules across all of the ages.  Then, to make matters worse, I just don't think that the strategy is very deep.  As is mentioned elsewhere, building on the Religion board is pointless.  There appear to be two strategies - build up big on the might board, or build up on the reason board and hope no one destroys your hard earned points.  Nice concept, but mediocre execution.

Strong game with some juicy meat around the bone, and which forces me to use different mental gears - and I always like that.
The English rulebook is confusing as hell, though. It would benefit from a re-write (and not just a straight translation of the French rules, which is what it reads like).

Nice idea (Euphrat and Tigris on multiple board which influence another). Bad result. Far too prone to analysis paralysis. New age looks quite useless; even a building that seems to be uncontested can be ruined by 2-3 (sub-optimal) plays of other players.

Dit spel heeft in mijn ogen één van de meest originele mechanismen in een spel.

Spelers zijn tijdreizigers die in drie tijdperken in hetzelfde gebied gaan bouwen. Ze reizen heen en weer in de tijd, met als gevolg dat gebouwen die in een eerder tijdperk worden gebouwd er voor zorgen dat gebouwen in een later tijdperk verdwijnen.

Moet ik vaker spelen om echt de strategie er voor te ontdekken.

Much interaction. One of the games where you play not just to win but mostly to make your opponents' lives harder.

Kudos for the unique theme on time traveling and the innovative rippling effect between the three boards.  Khronos is definitely a game that sounds absolutely fascinating to play on paper, but the execution of the mechanics is another story.

Besides the fact that your actions each round are severely restricted by what you manage to draw, I have two major concerns with the gameplay itself to consider Khronos as more than just mediocre.  First of all, I've found the Age of Reason to be fairly underpowered.  Mainly because this section is "reactive".  Nothing you do on this part of the board can affect the other two.  Conversely almost everything that happens in the Age of Might and Faith will impact it.  As a result, the scoring potential of this age is dramatically handicapped.  This is further exacerbated in the fact that civil buildings are not limited by the rule of hierarchy (only one of the largest religious or military building may exist per domain), therefore, it is more likely that for a given domain, it will worth much more in the first two ages than in the last one.

Secondly, there is little to no incentive in constructing buildings in the Age of Faith.  In terms of military building, it does not help you to increase your control of a domain since the change does not ripple backward into the Age of Might.  It is also very susceptible to being destroyed if erected at a location that is currently unoccupied in the first age, this is applicable to the other two types as well.  Even though you are awarded one extra coin, that alone is not enough to offset the risk taken.

All in all a good effort on translating a difficult concept into a boardgame, but ultimately not very balanced to make it a worthwhile experience to repeat, especially after the novelty wears off.

Clever game, only drawback is the long downtime with a lot of players and not enough cut-throat actions with 2 players. I hope the AP problem gets less and less important once you are comfortable with the games (maybe have to rerate it).
The german rules are horrible but I'm sure they get corrected in the 2nd edition. The contact with the designers about rules questions was very positive, therefore I don't substract a rating point for the bad rules :)

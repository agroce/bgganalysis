Some good stuff in this Wizards of the Coast CCG, and some unique-looking cards (and a mechanic that took advantage of these plastic, partially-transparent, pentagonal cards).  Unfortunately, as in many of WotC's CCG offerings, there is a lot of material that will be a bit too familiar for fans of WotC's flagship card game.

Loved buying the 'hexes', didn't find the game so fun.  Took FOREVER to play, and could never get a grasp of the strategy.  Fairly innovative concept though!

RATING: 8.4
A nice, natural followup to the mechanics first presented in Magic the Gathering. The stacking 'abominations' and clear card edges are a really nifty idea, and I like how the cards can also be assigned as mana, rather than needing to cross your fingers for the draw. Otherwise, the different card abilities are intuitive, and a lot of the play (attacking, blocking) is similar to MtG. Use d20s in place of the soul counters to speed things up, and you've got a great dueling game. I think the theme must have failed it, because otherwise this is beyond solid.

1x Starter
1x Core booster box
1x Blanket of Lies booster box
1x Last Hallows Eve booster box

My initial response after a few 2-player games was so-so, but playing with 3 players (and more) makes the game really shine. THere's a lot of back and forth and coll interplay with all the cards on the table. I like it.

When Magic The Gathering meets Lovecraft. The game itself is nice, but apart from the theme it is almost a MTG ripoff. The idea of creating abominations is nice, but a little too tricky. There are far better CCGs out there, even if you stick to the dead ones.

Unplayed. 

My boyfriend played this before I met him. The cards are awesome and I want to give it a try... just seems everytime we sit down to make a few simple decks we get distracted by something.

Whilst I would have liked to give this CCG's a try as the concept is really quite interesting. The b/f put his foot down on CCG's as we simply do not have the time to construct decks and learn to play. There are other card games out there, in particular [thing=156776][/thing], which we devote our time to and enjoy

can get a ton of boosters for this discontinued CCG very cheaply now, so I picked some up on a lark off EBay. Plays alot like Magic in many ways, but felt very defensive and plodding in 2 player games. Pros: the art and theme is dark and gruesome and the card design totally weird, making it interesting, and has no mana screw. And I got a Cthulu and Loki card.  Cons: impossible to store due to size, no rules support and some odd questions, too slow and defensive at first glance.

Hecatomb was a Hecka Bomb!  I just wanted to say that.  So, the game is a little daunting with the card interactions and the fact that the starters are really so random that the game requires deck building right out of the gate.  This kinda kills it for me, as I am not into deck tuning that much.  It's an okay game with excellent artwork and theme.  I am happy to play it again, but it didn't excite me like I had hoped.  Hopefully some familiarity with the system will help me out more.  For now though, it was pretty limiting in what I could do, so there wasn't much in the way of tactics.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Intriguing little game, with many possibilities and innovative components. The mechanism for stacking minions into abominations and activating conditional abilities when the right colours connect is clever - although it does make deck-building rather more complicated than in most CCGs. The game is hampered by the small starting hands - coupled with each player starting out with five souls (of the twenty needed to win) and getting one at the beginning of each turn, it means you can lose the game before you've ever drawn the right cards to be competetive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

This is a great take on the CCG games with a very interresting stacking mechanic. Wizard would do well to consider releasing this game in a boxed set like Blue Moon with predefined decks and release 2 expansions covering the other sets.

2013 January - Jackie and I have a long history of trying to play this game.  We took the day off from the french market and went to Ihop and finally succeeded in having a two rounds.  We played the first one wrong the second one went smoother and intrigued me.  It occured to me that I really love everything that came from WOTC during this time period.  Dreamblade and the minis games are still favorites.  -H7
2013 January update - Jackie and I have been playing non-stop doing our traditional 'open a booster every play and have been having a great time.  Honestly it's the triggers that keep me coming back.  At this point the only thing keeping me from giving this game a 10 is that 95% of the time game end involves you 'giving up' the game (by not being able to hit)rather than through a true act of aggression.  -H7

Hecatomb is a pretty strong game, but one that I'm not particularly interested in.  I found there to be too many powers, game terms, overrides, exceptions, what-ifs, and so on.  The game also started sluggishly and ended rapidly without much of a feeling of control.  I don't pretend to be the target audience for this sort of game and I'm sure that earlier in my gaming life I would have been all over it.  I love the artwork though and the nifty cards (what a brilliant idea), but I am disappointed in the unimaginative, lackluster, and overly complicated gameplay.  I'll stick to my simple but deep MtG clones like Blue Moon.

RATING: 7
The flow of gameplay seems decent and the stacking mechanic for abominations is interesting.  The theme here is something of a turn off for me as I'm not really a horror fan, but the clearance prices have tempted me to explore the deckbuilding aspects of this game further.  This is really my first experience with deckbuilding on a large scale and am finding that I enjoy tinkering with different combinations.  I would really need to play more often to get more out of this one though.

I really wanted to like this game.  After reading the rules, it seemed like Magic: The Gathering in a simplified form.  But it was boring drudgery to me.  The transparency of the cards is pointless, it could have been accomplished without it, but more annoying than that is the pentagonal shape... there is no reason for it really, and it makes the cards hard to handle.  Boo.

RATING: 3
EVOLUTION. This is fairly dull.  The mechanic was innovative, but unimpressive to me and my group.  We would have preferred cards with text and more actual work being thought of in the game as a whole.  This was fairly dull, especially since you have to build up your creatures (mutating them) before you can launch your first attack.

RATING: 7
Fun when you're in an "I want to destroy the world" mood. Really cool concept (rotating/stacking transparetish cards), but the grim theme and some af the artwork excludes my younger kids from play. Multiplayer suffers a little from 'blood in the water' syndrome, but still playable when the stars are properly alligned... ^_^

A tcg that has really innovative semi transparant plastic cards that you stack to create mutants with which you can attack. It has interesting gameplay, but the horror theme is way over the top and everything looks/feels the same after a while.

RATING: 6
The theme is a bit to dark for me, which is saying a lot. I picked the game up because I'm making a game with a dark theme and wanted to see how far such things can be pushed. I feel this game went too far. It's really not offensive it's just depressing.

Leaving the theme aside the game mechanics are great! If you candied someone to play this with you are very lucky.its basically MTG but with simpler rules and a elegant and original system for tracking modifiers. The transparent cards work like gloom but the game does a great job of creating an epic struggle. In the end I prefer gloom because of the lighter theme.

Bought several boxes for dirt cheap and have had alot of fun with this one. Unfortunately certain strategies were left hanging by the lack of planned sets. The clear plastic cards are just cool. I'm not sure the mechanics are as elegant as MTG but I do like this one quite abit.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Decent for a card game.  The interest lies in the way the cards stack up to create new monsters.  Still not a fan of life point versus card games.  Like usual for these types of games, one player usually dominates the game early on and the other player rarely is able to put up a decent defense after that.  No coming back from the edge and that is why my interest quickly dies in these games.  That and the lack of decent, more then two player, variants.

A very cool and dark twist on the Magic formula. I honestly think this game came out too early.  I think the excessivly mature content is more welcomed in games now than it was when this came out.  The only complaint I have is that the games run too short.

The unique transparent cards and hexagonal design mask what's essentially another "player sending monsters to hit the other player" variation of Magic, but there are some interesting design elements that are worth noting such as the best card-overlaying mechanism ever and the super-tight control of the resource and progression curve.

Theme could have been explored better than the simple monster dueling format, but whatever. Worth it just for the experience of gawking a the incredible cards alone.

Pros:
ANY card may be played as a power source. (This eliminates the "mana screw/flood" problem inherent in Wizards' other, better-known CCG, Magic.)
Amazing artwork!
Short games.
Very simple rules.
CHEAP as DIRT (booster boxes go for $15-$20 right now).
Cards are made from plastic, so they're more durable. You can spill drinks on this game, and it won't ruin it!

Cons:
Pentagonal plastic cards are hard to shuffle, and difficult to store.

After one play with two slapped together decks: The game definitely has something. The Abonimation stacking mechanic and the combat tactics it makes possible makes for a refreshing change of pace from Magic.  

Own a lot of cards

This game was canceled by WOTC(hmmm wonder why, cause its f'n collectible!  see my initial comments below) which is somewhat sad since the game is pretty interesting with an endgame switch so games don't take forever.  

If you can pick it up cheap (and you can in some places since its canceled!) do it. :D

Original details:

Though does the world need yet another CCG?  Why not just market this game as a base set of 60 cards and make the rest a "set expansion" then just keep releasing expansion, kind of like heroscape.  Collectible sucks ass.  Reason for low rating is because it's Collectible. :P

unique and interesting mechanics, dull theme. Horror's overdone, and this one plain boring and pasted on.
Rather simple, few rules and complexity both during deck building and game play.
Very short, 2p games last about 10 minutes since "souls" auto-increase and the game's over after the first good (3-minion reaper,evader) combo.

Defunct CCG designed by the esteemed (at least to me!) Mike Elliott. The cards are bizarre plastic pentagons but the game's ideas for handling resource generation and stacking creatures into multi-tiered 'abominations' are interesting and enjoyable. It's sad that this one was so overlooked; it's actually very well done, and the cards are pretty nice once you get over the weirdness!

This game never got a fair shake. It's pretty well designed and works equally as well with 2 players and 3+ players.

Hmm, the mechanics are a 'rip-off' of the Gloom cardgame. Transparent acetate cards that stack on top of each other to change stats...expensive for what you get.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR]  Interesting, well-implemented use of transparency in the pentagonal "cards" here. The way creatures attack and deal damage is different and opens up some deck-building and tactical choices. I'd like to play more to firm up my rating.

RATING: 5.5
Rating after two games, probably play it a few more times. Once a few cards have been stacked (to make an abomination) it becomes a little tricky to turn. Also near impossible to shuffle hexagons. Nothing really grabbed me, so really unlikely that I will buy some cards. If I play with any regularity, it will be only with my brother's collection.

This is one of the best CCGs that I have ever played! 

While the basic rules are similar to MtG, it has several huge advantages: The minion stacking is fun and innovative. Less complicated card interactions due to timing. Games will end after a certain number of turns, so they won't drag on forever. Most importantly however is that you can play any card as a ressource which makes Hecatomb much less luck dependant!

It also works quite well in multiplayer (3 to 5 people), which is rare for a CCG since they are normally more "duel" oriented.

As perhaps the only man in the state of Delaware who plays this game (based on sales figures at my FLGS) I actually really, really like this game.  The artwork is fantastic, and there's just as much strategy as one would expect from a halfway decent CCG.  I really like the theme, too.

I got a deck at Gen Con. Unfortunately you need two decks to play. It would've been too difficult to track down a deck for this dead CCG and find players.

RATING: 7
Interesting refinement of the Magic system with Lovecraftian theme. First game took too long, but then we were getting used to the rules. Played with two starters, no boosters. Can be slow to start (as you effectively can't attack until the third turn unless you tune a deck to do otherwise) and keeping track of the interactions between the various cards can be difficult, but I'm still tempted to pick up a few cheap booster boxes and create enough decks for four players. I like the theme, but I can imagine it would put off some players. And what's with gothy themes and see-through cards (cf. Gloom)?

Jogo de 'cartas' colecionáveis com temática de terror. É muito interessante tanto pelo tema, quanto pelo visual. As cartas são pentágonos. Eu não sei como são as mecânicas, mas espero que sejam boas também.

Comprei alguns decks, o jogo foi descontinuado faz um tempo.

RATING: 5
I had played it only several times and it didn't feel quite right. I will give it another chance when I get some more cards and rearange my deck.
edit: New rating dropped to 6 because I'm really not eager to play the game even after getting new starters and boosters and building new decks. There is just too many wasted turns and moves in this game. It takes too long to develop. I have better CCGs to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Interesting twists from Magic: the Gathering, in that any card can be played for mana, and the transparency of cards is used to layer them to create powerful abominations with abilities.  The starter decks seem fairly balanced against each other, so just get a starter for each player and you may not need to ever spend more unless the collectable bug bites you.

Theme and graphics really neat, but game play is a bit lackluster.  Since you need 3 rounds before you can attack with a 2 minion abomination and you are getting one soul every round, there seems to only be a few combats before the game is over.

A magic tcg clone, but has very good horror artwork on it. The cards are hexagones and different cards can become one monster. I liked it more than magic, but there were almost no other players. And production of it was halted.

RATING: 6
Containing less of a theme and more of a tone/mood, the flavor of the game and therefore the artwork is fantastic. Timing issues are few and the stacking mechanics are pretty well done. This is good stuff. One thing I'm not thrilled about is how swingy the game is. It seems as though the scores swing back and forth with much too ease.

RATING: 6
Neat game design, but it's broken in half by the aggro deck and the cards didn't really inspire interesting deck design for me.

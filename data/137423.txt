Probably my favorite tactical card combat game.  Love the art style, the myriad of 'leader' choices, and being able to use a card for multiple things is one of my favorite game mechanisms.  Smashing PT 1&2 together just amps up the whole experience.  PT3 will be an instabuy.  (Notes are the same for both Pixel Tactics 1 and 2)

I enjoy Pixel Tactics as an occasional thing. I don't know the cards good enough to be competitive at all against someone who plays a lot. The second PT set is basically just more of the same thing. They did add Ongoing effects Order cards, which give you a special ability for a certain amount of time. We played the base set against the 2nd set with the base set destroying PT 2 in 2 games. As I learn these cards more, that should change. So, I will hold onto this for a while.

Favorite Cards:

1. Werewolf
2. Divinity
3. Warmage

Pixel Tactics is a wonderful game. However, if you are buying one version, buy PT1 over PT2. PT2 is much more defensive than PT1, which prolongs games, and this is a game which is better when it is quick and exciting. Add in the introduction of many defensive ongoing orders, and this game has the potential to overstay its welcome.

With that said, this game is still great fun, especially when combined with PT1.

The most brain-burning card game that I've had the pleasure of playing.

Nice addition to the base game, and also a standalone set.

PT2 in a weird way reminds me of Puzzle Strike Shadows; It's a self contained game, but represents a lot of eccentric characters and slightly-off/hybrid strategies. So when I'm playing it by itself, I'm often left wishing I had a more straight forward fighter/healer/mage, for the situation at hand.

This has been combined with the base game, so hopefully I won't be running into the issue I outlined above much longer. Looking forward to more releases (PT3, seven sisters, etc), so that I can turn my focus toward "constructed" decks and cube.

Highly recommended!

i took my time and checked out the Pixel Tactics series online before i decided to purchase this, discovering that it was perfect for my needs. once i got it out of the box and on to the table, it took quite a long time to suss out the rules with my partner for the first play but with every new game it gets quicker and quicker and with more familiarity with the cards easier and easier. im really looking forward to having memorized all these cards when we get PT3 or 4 or 5 and eventually i want the Deluxe. very nice game with a strong metagame

EDIT: (Deluxe is coming in the mail as a trade)Since my decks are constructed from mixed together sets, when i mark a play for any of my Pixel Tactics games i will be marking a play for all of them.

I champion this as the worst game ever. I have never met a person who has been willing to play it with me after looking at the rules (or even just at one of the cards), you have so many options that you are constantly paralyzed with indecision, whenever I try to replay it with the only other person I've been able to play with we bail almost immediately, the pixel art is the bare minimum of effort (compare with Boss Monster or Pixel Glory) to the point of sometimes being unrecognizable, and the fact that it suggests playing best 2 out of 3 or 3 out of 5 is the biggest waste of time I can think of.

While this game is more of the same when compared to its predecessor Pixel Tactics, you can see some of the refinements coming through. Most notably is that there are more strategies that seem to be viable. In PT1, there were sufficient enough cards that literally burned down entire rows, columns, or clusters of heroes that putting out multiple heroes or even individual fragile heroes was actively discouraged by the system (the flipside of this is that the game privileges leaders who can take advantage of additional actions that come with playing cards as orders such as the gunner or the summoner). However, this version doesn't seem to have any cards that provide that kind of firepower. This does not mean that cards are nerfed, but rather that what the cards offer this time around is more distributed (e.g., instead of dealing huge damage, you might be dealing less damage but then gaining an additional action). I also appreciate the fact that this set provides new means to deal with dominant strategies in PT1 should you mix the two sets together (e.g., the ability to cancel orders). While it is more of the same, you can tell that there is growth in design experience in this iteration.

----------------------------------------------------------
Update September 2015
I changed my rating of this game from 8->7: I played my first game in months, and this game certainly doesn't hold up well to large breaks in between plays. This is largely because the game has so much textual content that it requires a lot of work getting back into the game (especially at 25 cards per deck). Compare this to say Blue Moon in which only some cards have text (~half?) or BattleCON in which you only need to process a character's unique ability and styles (~7-8 cards)-- both of which generally have roughly a fourth of the text. 

Don't get me wrong -- PT is still a pretty solid Ogre Battle'esque card game with a lot of interesting synergies -- that requires semi-regular play to continue shining.

Initial Rating: 5.0 (June 2015)

I wanted to play Pixel Tactics first, but the opportunity arose so we played this one instead. I was certainly expecting a better game, I already bought all the Pixel Tactics sets and promos and now I’m thinking that perhaps that was a mistake.

The game has very simple rules and I felt the gameplay was also very simple. You need to choose a leader and protect him. I found many decisions to be, somewhat, obvious so I feel it is luck who decides if a players wins or not. I need to play more times to verify. Pixel Tactics 2 was very repetitive. 

I love the idea of mixing sets to change the game, many of my favorite games have this characteristic. Also love that each card can be the leader, adds a lot of replayability to the game but, after reading some of them, it seems they are unbalanced (more luck).

I’m worried about the playtime, it seems excessive for such a simple game.

I don’t know if there are differences between this one and the first game, but I will find out.

Bottom line, Pixel Tactics 2 is a regular/mediocre game for me right now, however, there is a caveat. I was awfully tired when I played it so I need to try it again to really see if I can like it. The premise of the game sounds awesome, but it was boring and repetitive. I will give it ample opportunities to woe me but its future looks grim.

I finally played Pixel Tactics 2 again and I had a blast. I’m not sure why my first game was so bad, perhaps it had to do with 1. I was very tired and 2. My opponent healed his leader a lot, so the game dragged. I’m still worried about the length of the game. It seems it is very high, but the game offers some interesting decisions. Each of the Pixel Tactics games need to be explored further because each card can be used in 5 different ways, so it is a lot meatier than I initially expected.

I want to play it again soon.

After reading the rules of Pixel Tactics Deluxe, I realized some of the rules changed. I hate when publishers do this and Level99 do this often (besides Pixel Tactics, they changed BattleCON: War of Indines and NOIR: Deductive Mystery Game) so buying their games when they just come to the market seems like a bad idea. They will change it within the year and your game will become obsolete. I’m talking about core rules changes, if they just reworded the cards so they would be clearer I wouldn’t have an issue, but they changed the core rules and that’s very disrespectful with the original backers, supporters and customers who bought the game in the first place (as I did). The deluxe edition, changes the amount of cards you can have in your hand, attack powers no longer exist so they don’t trigger “attack effects” and I’m sure there are other changes I haven’t seen yet. The changes seem small and they are, but they have a huge impact in play and having two sets of rules is difficult when playing with other players who doesn’t know the updated rules. If you are going to change something, you can do it as an official variant when you release an expansion, but that’s not the case here. If I want to have all my Pixel Tactics sets updated, I would have to buy again the number 1 2, and 3 sets and that make me angry and sad. Why should I have to pay twice for the same game?

Bottom line, I’m disenchanted with any publisher who changes the core rules of its games. So far I have encountered this behavior with Level 99 Games and with Stonemaier Games (Viticulture has changed 3 times in 3 years and they also change Euphoria :/), both of them are Kickstarter publishers so perhaps they don’t test their games as much as they should. Still I love Pixel Tactics 2, an amazing game.

Pixel Tactics 2 is a head-to-head game of tactical combat for two players. Each player has an identical deck of 25 cards, from which they draft a leader. The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.

I really really wanted to like Pixel Tactics. I had watched reviews, read reviews, poured over the artwork (I love 8-Bit artwork), and I was convinced this would be an easy slam dunk to pick up at GenCon. Sadly the gameplay is okay, but it feels like so many other 2 player fighting card games. Honestly there isn't very much that is original, or inspiring, about the game design. Place cards to do some things, attack your opponent, and then do more things. Rinse, lather, repeat. This same style of game was done much better when Plaid Hat Games released Summoner Wars.

Best of the original 3 by a narrow margin, to me. Great balance of units and unit abilities. Only slightly more complicated than PT1, but with depth and complexity to compensate. Equally competent opponents produce close games a lot in PT2, moreso than in the others or in games where expansions and such are mixed in. So, this is my favorite "pure stand-alone game" as far as PT goes - but they're all great.

So far it seems to have a much slower pace than Pixel Tactics 1, but it's still a fantastic game. The orders are less flashy, and it's harder to setup big attack options. Overall, I would say that the abilities tend to be a little bit more complicated, and less immediately devastating.

See Pixel Tactics. Cards in the sequel are a bit more complicated, but equally good. Combining the two allows for more interesting variants where players construct their own decks or draw from a shared deck, my preferred ways to play. Typos on the cards are mildly irritating, and only confirm my criticism of the first game. I wish Level 99's games weren't so unpolished. Plays logged as Pixel Tactics.

This is just Pixel Tactics with new decks of cards.  The only difference is some of the order effects are ongoing so they last for a whole wave, round, or even game after being played.

The wall of text on every card seems to turn people away. Its a good game and not overly complicated, but that aspect just seems to keep it from ever hitting the table.

I want to like Pixel Tactics, but it's so fiddly with so much tiny text that I really just don't enjoy playing it that much. And what's worse is you can't even ignore the tiny text, even when it's not active. It might be a skill curve thing, but every win thus far has been less about strategy and more about someone accidentally overlooking some words somewhere.

I have no idea how deck construction would work among the five (?) full sets and eight mini-packs in this game family. In general the presentation feels like this really ought to have been a computer game, rather than something produced on cards.

*2014  Second version of Pixel Tactics with new characters and powers.  This game certainly competes well in the portable games section of the collection, although gameplay can be a bit fiddly.  Connor and I enjoy it.

Pleasant enough...but I think I'd prefer the spatial element of something like Summoner Wars better. I only have room for 1 maybe 2 two player games in my life. This won't crack the rotation.

Doesn't bother messing with the Pixel Tactics formula, and that's exactly the right thing to (not) do. Fantastic game.

Put a guy in front of your leader to keep him from being attacked, then try to kill the opponent's guy in front of the leader, then repeat until you can get through to hit the leader. It comes down to pure luck as to who gets the right combination of cards at the right time to be able to damage the leader. Very tedious and very boring.

I like the idea of having a deck of 25 unique cards that all do different things based on where they're deployed, but this game just doesn't deliver.

Sold.

Have not yet had a game run less than 1:45 (h:mm). Working on figuring out how to speed this up. Apart from that, love it!

Meh. It's alright. Once again, there are other 1v1 games I'd prefer.

Got this at the Blue Highway Games 2014 used game auction. I was the only bidder at $5 and used my in-store credit to get it for free! For $5, it will be worth checking this out to see how it plays.

Cute card battling game. Simple to pick up and quick to play but there's a good amount of strategy. Similar in gameplay to Vanguard

Quite fun! Games go on longer than it seems like the rulebook wants them to when I play, though. My opponents and I seem to usually forget to actually attack the leader quite often and just fight each other's armies...

This is the card game version of my favorite video game (final fantasy tactics).

Solid game but too much reading for my taste and I can't get my wife or non-gamer friends into it. Everything is in great condition as it has only been played once.

There are definitely Leaders that draw this game out needlessly. Our play of this 30-minute game took 2 hours because one Leader prevented Orders from being played.

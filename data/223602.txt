Only just getting a handle on the strategies of manipulating the stock values.  A few more plays, a deeper dive and I may up the score a point.  Fantastic art style.

Not much of a Laukat fan, but I'm interesting in playing this. It has a hint of Winsome games (auctions, routes, stock holding). The map may be too static for repeated plays. I'm keeping an eye on this one.

I can see this game as definitely being a little divisive....the group you play with has to enjoy auction games.  What we found in our demo was that carefully judging the value of the card was the biggest determinate as to how close the players stayed until the end.  Go too big too quick, or play too conservative, and you'll be left behind by game end.  Not for everyone, but my group and I enjoyed it!

The game comes awfully close to being good, but just misses the mark. It's just rather dry, and far too long for what you get.

The auction mechanic is the worst I've ever seen: you bid, then the other players bid...and you can only up your bid once per game! A much better mechanic would have been a simultaneous bid, and still keep the "once per game" feature.

Then there's the mining stock mechanisms: it almost always ends with all the stocks at the same value! And the board says they can reach $10.00 per share...which they can't actually do! Apparently, the game was designed with an expansion in mind, and hence these seemingly broken features. But that's like saying, "Buy this game NOW! But WAIT! There's LESS! Yes, if you buy now, we will guarantee, in writing, that you won't get your full enjoyment out of this game until you also buy our yet-to-be-released expansion!"

Graphically, Klondike Rush is beautiful, with a gorgeous theme lovingly pasted on. It could easily have had any other theme at all....including grocery shopping.

Unique concept. The interesting idea is that the mining companies should have different stock values. But, no mechanics support you ever making that choice. You will always build a mine. So, end game is arbitrary.

Hunt for fortune and a mysterious snow beast in the frozen north. Bid on stocks in four different mining companies. Build mines and gather resources. Hunt for the snow beast and claim the reward! 2-5 Players. 60 Minutes. Explorers have discovered gold on Mount Titan! Four mining companies rush to grab the fortune, even as reports emerge of an abominable snow beast capturing miners and destroying camps. Will you strike it rich as you invest in and guide the endeavors of each company? Will you hunt down the snow beast and claim the cash reward for its capture?

Maybe there is an audience for this one, but I didn't feel any vibe with this one. Boring, repetitive, mines who always end on the same value. Basically, the one who plays his 'i want my money' card last, wins the game. The auction part is not fair, if you are the first to bid, you never win the mine card. They asked me if I want to play it and someday. My answer is simple: never again!

I like bidding games normally, and Ryan Laukat does something straightforward that at its core is actually tense and a lot of fun.  Beyond the usual "once around" bid for camps, contracts, and crates, the network building and set collection is all stuff we've seen before too, but it integrates all very nicely here.  On these points alone I would have rated the game an '8' because it takes some well-trodden and favourite mechanics and puts them together in a way that takes me back to some of the better designs of two decades ago.  Unfortunately the game takes a couple steps back because of two important issues.  First: the game is simply too long for what it is.  This should not be a 60 minute game.  If 15-20 minutes could be shaved off, it would have felt fine.  Maybe some tweaks and a 30 minute game and it would have been excellent. But Klondike Rush simply outstays its welcome as its quite repetitive.  My last concern is that there are things which could have been ironed out, but weren't.  The rulebook has some ridiculously glaring errors (which were addressed by an included errata sheet; but still...)  The number of turns for 3- and 5-player games is wonky when compared to 2 and 4 players (even number of turns vs not).  The fact that players can become dead broke and out of the game is, yes, something each player is forced to avoid; but the fact it can happen and there is no way to take a loan for a penalty or discard contracts for money in order to stay in the game sticks out like a sore thumb and doesn't belong in a game like this from a quality designer.  Also, some simple rules could have been put in to not have all the companies equally represented in the deck as it is possible that all companies will be worth the exact same amount by the end of the game, which really feels weird in this type of game and makes the "profit" card and the timing of its play way more of a factor in being the winner than it should be.  Though my negative points equal my pros, I think the pros are a lot more significant, which is why I'm giving a '7' to Klondike Rush.  I'd be interested in a 2nd edition that makes for a more thought-out game though.

After my second play, I am forced to drop the rating. I still really enjoy this game and with experienced players, I think this game could shine. But if you play this game poorly, it leaves you in a position where you basically can do nothing for a long stretch of the game. That is going to frustrate players. That leads to a runaway leader problem, which isn't really the fault of the game, it's more due to poor play, but that also frustrates players. As a result, this game just hasn't gone over well with my game group and I doubt it hits the table ever again. Nobody wants to play it again. Unfortunately, I'll probably have to sell/trade this away.

The game is really fun, fast and a great design. Except the very anticlimactic endning, where all the shares will be worth excactly the same amount every game, due to no cards being taken out. It was really missing some way to manipulate the values.

My first Laukat disappointment, solid yet unremarkable game. Monotonous gameplay with a market that doesn't matter as all the stocks end up the same price; takes an hour longer than it should.

So Ryan Laukat can never do wrong...okay, but maybe with this game. We enjoy it. We really do, but there is something about the final scoring that just doesn't sit right with everyone I have played with. The game feels very swing-y while you play, which is fun, but ultimately ends up with just about everyone being close in score at the end of the game.

Really liked it at two. Super-tense bidding, walking the tight-rope between fortune and bankruptcy. "When do I cash in my profit card?" seems to be the key decision. Will it hold up at higher player counts? Not sure.

Played it again. Too long with 3, and a lot more random in terms of what orders you get and whether you can complete them. Still really like the theme and it's pretty, but didn't really enjoy it the second time through.

Red Raven Games is my current favorite publisher, so call it halo affect, but I ALWAYS give their games benefit of the doubt before I crack the box first time. Had been tracking this game for awhile and was stoked for it to arrive last week. Have played it twice - once with 2 players and once with 3 players. The 2-player variant worked fine, but we all had a better experience playing with 3 players. Super simple mechanic. If you aren't playing with people who are good at these kinds of games, they'll get frustrated. I saw that happen in the second play-through. Enjoyable game. Just enough activities to keep people engaged. Both games ran long. I might pull a random # of mining cards out of the deck to shorter gameplay. Artwork is beautiful, of course. Looking forward to another game hopefully today!

Why play this when one can play a good auction game like Ra or Modern Art? The performance of the companies on the board is lame as all companies end up maxed out if people know what they are doing. Needs more play testing...

Sort of feels like Ryan Laukat putting on his Knizia cap. This is a game of auctions and set collection, and it feels very Knizian in its design. It also has a feel similar to the old game, Mogul, but unfortunately well outstays its welcome. If this game was 30 minutes or less, I could see it being a pretty solid game. Unfortunately it can feel very repetitive, very restrictive on funds, and last much longer than it should. I don't mind the game, but this is definitely one of Laukat's more phoned-in designs.

This is an auction game. If you successfully bid, you get more opportunity to get money, if you get more money you can successfully bid.

Misstep once and you end up with nothing you can do. Get orders you can't fulfill (because you don't have money to bid or build) and you drop behind.

Nope, not my type of game.

I simply don't understand this game. If I played correctly, all the mines will have the same value of 9 at the end. So it's probably the player who can stall the use of his profit-card the longest who will win, as in the end it doens't matter anymore. 
It also doens't help that the main mechanism is a one-time-auction, as I'm totally not found of that mechanic, but I understand that they chose it to keep playing time less then 1 hour.

Haven't yet played the full game, but only a demo. I would like to play the full game so the demo did a good job of making me want more. Not sure it stands out among other auction games I love, so I have decided not to get it at this time. I do like the added pressure of a once around auction, but I love Medici, shouldn't I just play that? A question to explore further.

Really enjoyed my first play. I ran out of money and spent the last half dozen turns sitting on my hands. Actually, 3 of the 4 people playing had this happen to them. Can't wait to try again.

P.S. I think this game would thrive with some rule tweaks to allow promote trading & income generation. Can't wait to get a copy and try it again.

solid auction & set collection game with great components, but it can be super punishing if you make any mistakes at all. would have been improved with some sort of 'intro/beginner rule' like "if you pass on bidding, make $1" or similar to prevent effective mid game elimination

I liked this way better than I anticipated from the comments on here.  Played 2 player twice so far.  The first game my opponent ran out of money about half way through the game and had to cash in.  The second game, neither one of us ran out of money.  The games isn't as hard as the comments on here portray.  The mining companies were not all up on the 10 slot at the end of the game like many others have complained about.  Maybe that happens with more players?  

The game is quite good, I like it.  Plus I love the plastic mines and the monster.  The artwork and everything is very nice looking.  Excellent presentation.

Klondike Rush is the newest Ryan Laukat game and I couldn't be happier for it to be a part of my collection. Laukat's games are always beautiful and elegant. His mechanics flow so well into his themes.  He's a true jack of all trades being Designer/Artist/Publisher on all of his games. This game is no exception! It's a fun auction game, which I know isn't for everyone, but if you enjoy them even a bit this game is worth a play! Don't play too conservatively or else you'll be left with nothing and no money!

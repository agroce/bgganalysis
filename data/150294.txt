Fairly basic abstract with a 'lowest score is your score' mechanism. Found the ugly graphic design to be colour-blind unfriendly and generally off-putting. Can't see myself playing it again.

I played this back when it was called Gaeon. A surprisingly deep, clever, quick abstract game. I kept thinking I had it solved, only to discover new depths. I suspect this one will keep abstract fans entertained for quite a while.

Kickstarted. Pretty lite pattern creation game. Sets up and plays quickly, has lots of variants provided - great value.

A reasonable filler, but as the number of legal moves remaining decreases, the length of a turn increases and the enjoyment of that turn decreases.

[b]First play with prototype:[/b] I enjoyed my single play of this.  Thoughtful abstract that plays in less than 30 minutes.  I especially liked the aspect of replenishing your hand with a tile from the board, forcing players to think beyond the points gained by tile placement, and to consider what tile they want in their hand for future play.  Hope this gets published!

[b]Impressions of published components:[/b] OUTSTANDING PRODUCTION!  Amazing!  See: [thread=1465272][/thread]

[b]First plays with published version:[/b] Really impressed.  Very clever abstract game, easy to learn, quick to play, yet very thoughtful.  And super components!

Best with 2 or 3, with 4 or more players down-time can become an issue.

Richly themed abstract with a couple of nods (or should that be nodz) to Reiner.  

The play is colourful and supports different player counts well.

My biggest gripe is that the rulebook is overly themed :-)

At first glance this could easily be ignored as not worth thinking about. its actually got more to it than you might imagine and whilst filler length can be quite cagey. Working out what to take while not allowing your opponents easy points is quite a task.

If price wasn't an issue, it would be nice to get it into the school and played by my students.

Prefer Ingenious to this. It can be a little repetitive towards the end of the game when a lot of the board is locked and players keep replacing the same tile/tiles.

Our local library games group was lent a very well-produced pre-production trial copy of this to game with the hope that we’d provide comments prior to any kickstarter bid.  The game itself is a clever little abstract where players attempt to score points by replacing a tile on the board with tiles in their hand to make long stretches of the same colour. Bonuses are awards if a closed loop is created and the loop itself is also locked. Each player’s end score is their lowest scoring colour 

The game itself plays well and is reasonably straightforward.  The calculator tool/ game gadget thingo is somewhat overproduced and perhaps unnecessary but might make a good ‘stretch goal’. Abstract fans can do a lot worse than this game, but for mine I would probably play this again but don’t think I’d purchase it (or back it) unless it was an exceptionally good deal.

Put the Tantrix ribbon system onto square tiles, mix in Knizia's "highest lowest-score wins" scoring system, and presto, a new game. You're trying to overlay a tile to increase the size of the ribbon in two different colours, scoring the size of each ribbon you extended. The neat twist is that you pick up the tile that you're overlaying, and you want to pick up a tile in the your lowest scoring colours, adding another dimension to the analysis. Which can quickly lead to paralysis with the wrong players. The positive side is that there are only 7 turns if the game goes downtown. To help overcome that, there's a clever piece of design in how ribbons get locked in, so the game board effectively decreases in size, and it's interesting to see how the chaos at the start gradually changes to order (ribbons tend to get longer). It's neat, it works, but it's work.

(Comments after more than a dozen plays)

Pros:
* Plays perfectly with 2
* Quick setup and cleanup
* Portable
* Bright and colorful
* Great attention to detail and a few clever "in" jokes (look closely at the numbers on the player boards).

Cons:
* There isn't really anything I dislike about the game, but it's expensive and harder to acquire than it should be.

Neutral:
* It's surprisingly easy to forget to decrement the round tracker.

Fantastic game. If you like Ingenious, you might like COGZ even more.

Our first play - very quick to pick up, and a lot of complexity evolves from the simple rules. I look forward to playing it a lot more!

It's a fun little abstract with mechanics that are not particularly ground-breaking, but are well-implemented. However, the components are an eyesore. The graphic design is really bad - that sort of design is not good for print. The colours are garish and the game is not colourblind-friendly. The little turn-tracking gizmo is over-produced, and could have been replaced by a simple flat track and moving token.  It would be good to see a compact re-print with nicer graphics - this could be a really nice throw-in-the-bag filler game if it were cheaper and not so over-produced.

This game is reasonable. Heavily inspired by Ingeneous. Based on first play I think I prefer Ingeneous. It's a little simpler yet still provides as much satisfaction. An advantage of this game is that it goes to 5/6 players, although I think with more than 3 it would slow down alot - it tends to produce a bit of AP.

It's called COGZ but they look like pipez to me: players take turns replacing square tiles showing two curved pipes in four colours. Extending a coloured section scores points, scored separately per colour, equal to its length; completing one into a circuit with itself or the sides of the board locks it in place (and scores bonus points). The winner is determined by comparing each player's lowest-scoring colours.

It's a reasonably pleasant abstract, likely best with 2, with control decreasing as that number rises. As an abstract I want to count the inelegant bonus points and extra turns against it, but as a pasted-on-theme filler that stuff is fine.

Apparently I can rate my own game. So therefore:
This is the best game in the known universe and only the second best in the unknown universe (multi dimensional COGZ wins that title). This game is a clear 123572/10 and.... Argh my Biasometer just exploded again!
That being said it is a very well polished Strategy, Pattern Matching game suitable for kids up to advanced strategists.

Clever resource management game. Bland theme, but the mechanics play well solo -- feels odd competing against an AI named AARON. Appreciate the small box... but not exactly thrilled by how much table space all these tiny cards take up (how?!). Never played the original CoB. May adjust my original 8 rating with further gameplay.

Great great game, although it cuts some of the elements from the board game (spacial element ), it still manage to get that CoB feel that I love... if you like the board game you should get this,  I've  read many comments saying "why should I play this over the board game if it's basically the same game" well it's easier to set up, play time is shorter  (streamlined )and it really feels like a euro game that can fit in a small deck box and you can take with you every where . Only bad thing I have to say is that it takes a big chunk of table space.  Recommended

Um jogo realmente divertido, mas que não é tão bom quanto o original. As únicas diferenças que fazem com que ele possa valer a pena são o tempo de jogo e o modo solo.

RATING: 5
As much as I love the board game I cannot see me as a fan of this card game version of Burgundy. I think this primarily due to less powerful effects on the cards. Thus the game does not offer as interesting decisions because there are no big trade-offs to mull over. Moreover, you do not get to choose from various board layouts that allow for different strategies or any indication what you should be first aiming at. Now it feels like you are only doing whatever the cards tell you without giving it any deeper thought. Another thing that might have an impact on this is that instead of rolling and finding a use for two dice every round, you now play only one while the other remains unused and unchanged. Hence, it is very likely that at some point of the game you end up having one useless card in your hand for a long time. In practice this means that you are at the mercy of luck of draw. 

Card game versions of board games usually aim at playing faster and being easier to approach than their board game counterparts. However, The Castles of Burgundy Card Game manages to be more confusing without any substantial reduction in playing time, except for the setup and upkeep because primates are nimbler at dealing cards than at plucking cardboard chits.

I could play but do not fancy it.

Decent facsimile for the big box version, but way too fiddly and space-consuming for the reduced play time (which isn't even that long anyway). Can't see a reason to play this over Castles of Burgundy other than the tiny box for portability, if that's a concern.

A thoroughly enjoyable card version of the original.  It seems to miss some of the nuances and brain-tickling you get from spatial strategies, but it still is a very enjoyable design.  Pretty small package, but the game requires a LOT of table space.  My only gripe is that the size of the illustrations in the rulebook render the iconography unplayable to older eyes.  I'm sure a player aid will come together soon to help!

here we have a great little game in a small boxes. All time im feeling playing the original COB, but with tiny cards. The game area is huge, but the gameplay works very well. The manual have some mistakes, but nothing too serious.

Nothing like the board game.  Some things are actually opposite how they happen in the board game, so quite confusing in that regard.

I haven't played the board game, but rahdo's runthrough enticed me into getting this. I knew from having played Apocalypse Chaos that figuring out dice allocation/mitigation is fun, and combo chaining is always fun as well. This has both of those mechanics and that was certainly intriguing.

And it turned out good! I really quite enjoy playing it. Despite the variety of options available, it still hums along quite fast. That's one reason that I chose this over the board game because it is playable with 4, where the board game is probably slow with more than 3.

Though, it seems a bit of a question whether you're actually playing with others when you play the game. I do enjoy playing the game, but it is definitely multiplayer solitaire. And I say that from having played both multiplayer and solitaire mode. I'd be hard pressed to provide any differences between the two!

So in that sense, it's not really a very good board game. Fundamentally, the reason you play a board game instead of a video game, is because you want to interact with others. And here, you're really not. At least, not if you're introducing this to a bunch of people for the first time.

I could see, if you play this two-player, and both of you know how one another thinks and what the other person is liable to do, then the game could become a multiplayer experience, as you race to get to the good thing in the marketplace, or you block the other person from what they need. But, like I said, you would both have to have a pretty deep knowledge of the game and each other. And I actually think that this would be a great couples game, on that basis.

So, overall, I'd say that it's a great solitaire game and probably also a great couples game. But on game night, it's sort of a waste to play this instead of something else that really benefits from having more players.

Η γνωστή μας Βουργουνδία τώρα και σε card game έκδοση. Αρχικά να πω πως το μικρό κουτί περιέχει πάρα πολλές κάρτες μικρού μεγέθους και χρησιμοποιεί τα ίδια ακριβώς γραφικά με την κανονική έκδοση. Κάθε κάρτα έχει ένα κτίριο ή ζώο ή εμπόρευμα και ένα ζάρι. Φυσικά κάθε κτίριο έχει το δικό του κλασικό ability.

Ουσιαστικά στην σειρά μας έχουμε 2 κάρτες διαθέσιμες στο χέρι μας και τις χρησιμοποιούμε σαν ζάρια και μόνο. Μπορούμε να κάνουμε ακριβώς τις ίδιες κινήσεις με το κανονικό παιχνίδι. Παίζοντας λοιπόν μια κάρτα/ζάρι μπορούμε να πάρουμε ένα από τα κτιρια που είναι τυχαία τοποθετημένα στο κεντρικό market. Παίζοντας πχ ένα 2αρι μπορούμε να πάρουμε μια κάρτα από το market 2 και πάει λέγοντας. Μπορούμε να έχουμε μέχρι 3 κτίρια στην ‘αποθήκη’ μας. Μετά μπορούμε να κατασκευάσουμε το κτίριο παίζοντας μια κάρτα/ζάρι που να ταιριάζει με το ζάρι που δείχνει το κτίριο. Άλλη επιλογή είναι να κάνουμε discard το ζάρι μας για να πάρουμε 2 εργάτες που μας επιτρέπουν να κάνουμε +/- 1 σε κάποιο ζάρι. 

Οπότε ποιές είναι οι διαφορές;; Πρώτον δεν υπάρχει χάρτης και απλά χτίζεις ξοδεύοντας το σωστό ζάρι. Δεύτερον δεν υπάρχει black market και πλέον με τα χρήματα τραβάς 3 τυχαίες κάρτες από την τράπουλα και κρατάς όποια θες. Τρίτον τα ζώα λειτουργούν λίγο διαφορετικά αφού προσπαθείς να κάνεις σετάκια από διαφορετικά ζώα.    

Υπάρχουν βραβεία για όποιον χτίσει πρώτος 3 κτίρια ίδιου χρώματος αλλά και γενικά παίρνεις δωράκια όποτε κάνεις τριάδα. Όσο νωρίτερα το καταφέρεις τόσο μεγαλύτερο και το δωράκι. Φαντάζομαι είναι η ίδια λογική με τα μπόνους ολοκλήρωσης περιοχής στο χάρτη στην μεγάλη Βουργουνδία.  

Έχει όντως την αίσθηση και το gameplay του μεγάλου του αδελφού. Γιατί όμως να συμβιβαστώ με το Βουργουνδάκι όταν μπορώ να παίξω το real thing; άλλωστε προτιμώ να ρίχνω ζάρια από το να τραβάω κάρτες με νούμερα. :p

This game has some of the fun of the original board game, the Castles of Burgundy, but not enough as I experienced it.  The original managed to use dice in a fun and innovative way, and this game essentially incorporates "the ghost" of rolling dice by using cards to stand in for rolls.  

The effect is blah for me.  Why not just roll some dice!?  I almost feel like the game should ship with dice just to give you the option of rolling rather than being stuck with cards, cards and more cards.  

Then again, undoubtedly, the game design goal was to design a card game, and only card game, with nothing else in the box, thus necessitating this design.  The net result is a respectable and clever game, in parts, but not particularly compelling enough to make me want to play it again.  I have no desire to play it again, so I should give it a 5, but I will go with a 6 for now.

Nice card game version of the original. The best thing about it is how small and compact the box is. It makes it easy to bring the game with you. The original board game is still a lot better if you have the space and room for it - bring/buy that instead.

Removes the most interesting aspects of the board game to leave something that feels dull and uninspired in comparison. Worse, it almost rivals the original in rules complexity and space on the table. I would never choose to play this over the original.

Eh it's okay.

If you've played the board game version I think you'll be let down.

This game has considerable setup and takes up a lot of space on the table.

Overall it's not terrible; but I feel as if I'm going to spend 45 min I'd rather spend a little more and play the main game.

Biggest let down: The yellow cards lose all of their cool and dynamic power from the main game.

Things I like: Puts a good twist on the main game. Silver is neat as is the purple wild cards.

I think this is a faithful convertion of the boardgame. The goals are basically the same, score points closing areas, this time represented by triples - sets of 3 cards of the same type/color. A new type of building/tile, the purple 'cloister' buildings that work as wilds, but if played by itself has a higher score than other colors.
After you know the game well it plays faster than the boardgame.

Nagyon hasonlít a tábláshoz!!! Grafikailag is, működésében is próbáltak minél többet megőrizni a Burgundból, így aki ismeri az eredetit, annak ezt nagyon könnyű lesz megtanulnia. Előnye a táblással szemben, hogy kb. 10-ed akkora a doboza, és sokkal rövidebb a játékideje is. Cserébe talán egy kicsit kevésbé változatos. A kockadobás is jól van imitálva a kártyákkal, és összességében is rendben van, ha valakinek nincs ideje a nagyra, nyugodtan helyettesítheti ezzel:)) 4 főnél viszont nem sokkal kisebb a helyigénye, mint a táblásnak:)

Does exactly what I wanted it to be: A fast playing card game with the feel of CoB and lots of decisions left. The sacrifice of the spatial aspect is ok with me as it made the game drag out/feel too repetetive for my tastes. - It's not meant to replace CoB for anyone, but it provides a challenging 2 player game in 30 minutes which is a pure winner for me.

like the board game but much quicker.  Takes up a decent amount of table space although some comments about this overstate this and there is a lot of game in a small amount of cards.  Different enough for it to be worth owning both but similar enough that if you dont like one you probably wont like the other.  I like that its pretty clear from the icons what the cards do, my one complaint with the board game was you needed to be always looking at the guide on the player board and on the rules sheet for the knowledge tiles to know what did what.

I prefer this to its big brother! (which I like very much). For me this is because it is so much quicker and gives frankly a good kicking to some of my other set collection card games that just seem that little bit on the light side for my taste. For the play time, I find this a phenomenal set collection game. A really nice balance of depth to play time and quick, slick turns. Boom, boom, boom. And I find it fun to play.

The main downside to the game is, that it is a heck of a table hog considering it has mini Euro cards! However, it does pack small, so even though you need a bit of table space to play it on, it is otherwise very portable.

I am really surprised by how much I like this, I went in thinking, I hope it can approach how good the board game is. I didn't expect to love it even more. One of my surprises of the year.

Initial Impressions:
----------------------------
Not has good as it's big brother, but it works well and does give you enough to think about.  The original game looked terrible, so its funny that they brought over the awful graphics into this game.  Another odd fact is that the rulebook on this one isn't very good, which is surprising since the game isn't that complicated.  Also with this new sized box, the rules are too small for the picture size they used.  Looking forward to more plays for sure.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Herr Feld and Alea have never played Euphrates & Tigris: Contest of Kings. If they had, they would know what to not to do when making a card game version of a popular complex board game.

This game, like E&T: CoK, is actually a phenomenal design achievement. To install almost the complete experience of the original complex board game, into a tiny package, using only cards, is very impressive and I tip my hat at Feld's (and Knizia's) design skills.

HOWEVER. This is not what a lot of people want from Complex Game: The Card Game. What they want is a game that has a lot of the same feel as the original, but in a streamlined and more family-friendly game, one that takes takes up less table space and finishes in half the time. San Juan is the perfect example, and an example that Alea should be familiar with!

To play either this or E&T: CoK is to play a game that is very close to the original experience. The cards are small but there are so many that it takes up just as much space as the original. Any streamlining is slight if present at all, and if it's lighter at all, by an infinitesimal amount. The game is slightly shorter, but nowhere near as short as the box for either game says it is. And cards are used non-intuitively to represent things that are more intuitive in dice or cardboard form anyway.

Playing this game, one is left with the overwhelming feeling of: It's just like the original, but a bit more obscure because you don't have the board to help you visualise. Hurm. ...Why don't we just play the original? Only fans of the original would like this, but they already like the original, and it literally offers [i]no advantage[/i] over the original, except in price. "Hey, you already have the board game? Would you be interested in buying the same game again? Only ten bucks!" Great deal, but I already have it — give me a different game instead please.

A good card game version would have at least some fans who would [i]prefer[/i] to play this over the original, because for example they like the original but prefer a lighter experience. I'm like this; I'd play San Juan over Puerto Rico any day. There is no reason to play this over the original, except for price it offers no advantage at all over the original. It's not really lighter, it's not much shorter, but hey, cards.

If you don't like Castles of Burgundy, pass. It's the same game.
If you like Castles of Burgundy just the way it is, pass. You already have this game, and the better version.
If you like Castles of Burgundy, but wish it was a little bit lighter, pass. It's not, really.

For whom is this game intended?

I like CoB and I like this, which surprised me.  I was going into this not liking it.  It has some of the same feels as it's parent game but I personally felt that it was different enough.  Now that I set it up once, it would be a breeze to whip out quickly.  

Call me pleasantly surprised.

An interesting adaptation of the larger board game.  While I didn't like how it was all mini cards instead of something more normal sized, I can understand why because this can be a table hog.

While I think I prefer the board game more due to the tile laying aspects, I still like the simplified approach this game takes. My only concern is for being such small cards, it still takes up a ton of table space. I also generally avoid buying mini-sleeves for cards like this, but considering the amount of shuffling/wear and tear I believe they'll receive, it feels like a must.

Love this one. Captures some of the same feeling as the board game, but really has different game play, where hand management plays an important role. The "dice on cards" mechanic is very well-implemented, and you have lots of interesting decisions to make on your turn. Quite a lot of game in this tiny box, which has quickly made it one of our go-to "travel games."

RATING: 5
Just like most "Popular Board Game: The Card Game" games, this manages to be a decent, light, card game that mimics the board game in some ways.

You'll be playing a hand of cards in order to claim other cards to add to your tableau, and then activating them in your tableau, with each card granting you a simple one-shot ability for activating it. Activated cards also score you points at the end of the game for collecting sets of 3 in a card type.

Overall, it's fine, but it would never have any popularity without the Castles of Burgundy namesake, which is usually the case with these generally pedestrian dice or card game implementations.

Heard about this on /r/boardgames.

Thought it might be a perfect fit - Patricia doesn't like the dice in the original game.

Still, it might be too point-salady.

After buying this game, she said, "So if I don't like dice in a game, you buy a game where there are dice printed on the cards?!?!?!" Fail. :(

Update after 5 plays:
The game is collecting dust and we are actively avoiding to play the game. No matter how well you play, final scores are super close (1-3 points). 3 of the five recorded plays were won by owning the first player marker at the end of the game... [b]Stick to the original if you value your time![/b]

Original review:
Interestig spin on the boardgame, but much less enticing. I only bought it due to the "travel" size, and that is exactly the niche it fills for us. If you are looking for a "simple card game" go for this one! If you want some actual "thinking" and sense of accomplishment, go for the original boardgame!

After the first few games, I feel that the game is very limited in what players can actually do per turn. This is emphasized by the "luck of the draw" of the buildings each round (which can - sort of - be mitigated by a good player, but the game just feels random). Our games (only 2-players) either end with scores VERY close to each other (1-3 points difference) or one of us gets hosed by the cards and looses by a landslide. Both outcomes do not feel rewarding... At all!

Not sure this game will stay at 5... Might even drop to 4!

If I had never played Burgundy before, I would probably rate this card game higher. But it's inevitable that this one is compared to its bigger brother, CoB the board game, and in that comparison there is only one (clear) winner!

To me, the card game is quite good, and it does incorporate a lot of the mechanisms from the board game, but it also removes some of my favorite parts, which makes the card game less enjoyable to me. First of all, the spatial element is totally removed, which was an awesome part of CoB as sometimes you couldn't/wouldn't take projects as you couldn't place them soon, but in this game you can just grab whatever you like, which makes it much less interesting.

Also, the way scoring works is quite different than in CoB, and I like it less. The same goes with animals and goods; just not remotely as interesting. There are other differences as well (the way the cards determine your actions (instead of rolls) is cool), and to be sure, CoB the card game is a decent game, but I would just not play this one over the full board game, especially when the board game only takes me and my wife 15 minutes longer to play!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
*7* (Initial plays)
Definitely something I would like to play more. It's like CoB... and it isn't, a little shorter and uses a ton of cards. I like the collection aspect and the use of cards to obtain other cards. I really, really do not like the small cards. I would still choose playing the original game over the card game because it's more satisfying and only slightly longer in game length.

I was surprised how much I enjoy this game. It has that "I've got a ton of options, but which one is the best" thing going for it that I enjoy from just about any game. And the solo rules that are included seem to produce enough of a challenge for now. 
If this is Feld, I want more. But I feel like I haven't seen many of his games that can be played solo. Must investigate further...
...The Aaron solo opponent seems a little too hard to beat without some luck. Lowering my rating until I find a BGG solo variant that makes this a little more balanced.

After reading mixed reviews on this COB The Card Game I had the feeling i might be disappointed.  Nope, i really enjoy this little game.  It's not COB but has very similar mechanics.  It's portable, it's cheap and it plays in about a half hour.

The only issue i had with it is the table space it takes.  Otherwise, solid game.

RATING: 7
This is a very straightforward port of the board game and if you are a fan of the original I'd venture to say that you will enjoy this. I felt it was missing the tension of the constraint of the board itself and the knowledge tiles are converted into something a bit too generic, but aside from those minor nits, I enjoy the game. Its easier to take along when traveling, but takes up almost as much table space.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Inoffensive, capable conversion of the original. It captures many aspects, including the crucial 'making the most with what you've got', although to be honest in the card game this aspect is more pronounced. You really have little idea of how your estate is going to develop due to how the cards make their appearence, which is different from the parent game. But don't despair: there are, as indicated, many ways of properly mitigating the randomness in everything.

Apart from an absent scope for specialisation through the original's action tiles (the card game doesn't know about these) I'm actually hard pressed to come up with reasons why one would pull out the original given access to this small box. That's quite the complement actually. I should add that I'm not much of a fan of the original because it seems impossible to do bad at it, just as it seems impossible to ever create large point deltas. To have those same 'issues' captured in a smaller and shorter package is then a Good Thing, if a perverse one.

I've found Burgundy to be a consistently excellent game, and in my opinion it's Feld's best. So a compact version that plays in less time sounded very appealing. I first learned this on Yucata, and liked it well enough that I went out to grab my own little copy.

Most of the spirit of the original game is still here with numbers dictating both acquiring and placing cards, as well as offering you other options. What's nice in this version is that the cards are dual purpose and cover both the "die roll" as well as the tiles from the original game. The play is definitely a bit faster (60-90 min in my experience), and the set-up between rounds is much quicker.

The only downsides for me are first that it takes up a LOT of room on the table. What you gain in playtime you lose in space, so don't be fooled that the small box means this is a "portable, take it anywhere" game. Secondly, I do miss the various bonuses from knowledge tiles in the original game, which is completely absent here. Instead you get bonuses for completing sets, which is more generic and not as interesting.

All that being said, a solid reimplementation and I'm happy to have both games on my shelf.

The boardgame version is better game. So i can´t understand the reason to play this game.

Great game! Pros: Captures the overall feel of COB in a slightly shorter amount of time and comes in a small  box. I like the idea of getting a set of 3 cards of the same color. Cons: It takes up more table space than a standard game of COB. By the end of the game, there are piles of cards ALL over the table. I got this game so that my wife and I could play COB on the go, and while the game itself is excellent, this definitely won't be one of our "travel" or "restaurant" games. And if I'm at home and want to play COB, I'll just go for the standard version. At 2 players, it's not THAT much longer. Set up time for the original is about the same, if not a little faster if you have everything organized in a good insert/plano box. However, I might opt for a game of the card game over the original in the case that I was in the mood for something slightly on the lighter side or teaching non-gamers. It's a great game, but just be aware that it is no way a "travel sized" version of COB.

Does a fine job of preserving the feel of the board game. I prefer the original because solving the tile placement puzzle is more interesting than collecting sets of three cards, and because the benefits from placing tiles (particularly the building and knowledge tiles) are more varied than those from placing cards; however, the card game is much quicker, and I'll eagerly play it when time is short.

Definitely not as good as the partent game....  however, it is small, fast (for 2), very inexpensive (which is rare these days), and very much feels the same.   The artwork (and bad colors) are directly ported over, which is lazy, but again, it isn't hard to see why (price).   There are a number of tokens (workers, silver) that are converted over to cards....  just because it is a card game, when really they still want to be tokens.   The cards are super tiny, and the ability strips even smaller, but if you know the parent game, you basically know how these already work anyhow.

Very excited to get to play this, and it was decent. It takes up a surprisingly large amount of table space, actually. My first impression (and I'd like further plays before I draw any firm conclusions) was that it suffers from the comparison to the original. The game itself is good, but slight differences in how things work kept throwing me off. I found myself missing the positional aspect of the original, but it is a different game and I need to get over that. So, onto the next play with a fresh perspective.

RATING: 6.5
Flawed but serviceable. It simplifies the right things from the board game version- gone is the huge collection of iconography that requires consulting the rulebook.

Makes a great travel game since the miniature cards will fit flat into a standard deckbox, but will take up a lot of room on a table. Its probably best with 2 players.

2017-08-08 : First play. The game succeeds in keeping the feel of its parent, but after playing it I wonder why one would bother as you could just as easily play the boardgame, which is less finicky and simply better. One of those games you're glad you played - once. On the trade pile it goes.

RATING: 10
A very quick but subtle game. Every turn is a dilemma between two cards, which simplify and intensify the game at the same time. A 2 player game lasts less than half an hour but offers very good tactical opportunities. The two card choice reduces thinking time and possibly analysis paralysis while offering hard choices to the player.
Very transportable, a must have for travelling hardcore player.

In French : 
Un jeu rapide mais subtil. Chaque tour est un dilemme entre deux cartes seulement, ce qui simplifie et intensifie le jeu en même temps. Une partie à 2 joueurs dure moins d'une demie heure mais offre de très bonnes opportunités tactiques. le choix entre deux cartes réduit les choix et la possible analysis paralysis tout en imposant des choix cruels aux joueurs.
Très pratique à transporter, un indispensable pour tout gros joueur voyageur !

It was surprising how much of Castles of Burgundy has been condensed into such a small box card game. Despite the small box, this game takes up as much or possible even more table space than the original game. For the cost and depth of this game, it's a great value. That said, I think people familiar with Castles of Burgundy will ultimately prefer the original game due to it's spatial element, unless someone is looking for something that plays quicker but has a similar feel. It's definitely worth trying, but is still probably a try-before-you-buy if you've played the original game.

A real surprise. I find this far better than its big brother. Gives the same feel and enjoyment in a quarter of time (actually even less). Sure it´s not quite as deep, but the saved time compensates that easily.

This is also super compact, although takes about the same table-space as the board game. Enjoy it a lot (with all player counts) and replaces the board game for me.

Big letdown. Maybe I need to play it some more, but the gameplay feels very constraint and uninspired. All you try to do is get sets of three. The biggest drawback in my opinion is that there are no yellow tiles that give you special powers. So you never feel like you can build up some kind of combo.

So much worse than [thing=84876][/thing].

An okay game and acceptable offshoot of Castles of Burgundy, but I can't see why anyone would prefer it to the original.

The only clear positives are the smaller box size, the smaller price-tag, and the solo mode.

i played both board version and this one, surprisingly i love this better.
it's super fast-paced and yet keeping all the beautiful essenses of the board version. It's much faster than the board version, especially the set-up time and the time between two rounds. and players play one action each time, so it's much faster than the original one, too. The tense in this game trying to get the bonus faster than other players are really fun. 
i think, like its original version, 2-player game feels the best.

2. I understand there's a huge error in translation to English. The rules state: "Each player receives one of the current round bonuses when completing a triple. Each player may choose which bonus to take." This is incorrect. Only the player completing a triple gets the bonus.

What I like: 
1. The box is nice and small and I can easily take it with me on the road.

Coverts every aspect of CoB to card version. While not all the card types use the same mechanism, I found the overall scoring to be a bit bland.

Artwork is the same so that part is still bland. The game is about 1/3 to 1/2 quicker though so you can actually play with 4p faster.

Overall the mechanisms in the game didn't grab me and the game wasn't short enough or had good art/other feature that would keep me immersed in the game. It tried to keep all the different aspects from the base game but in doing so, made all of them not that interesting versions of the previous iteration. I would have preferred if they removed certain things and just focused on a few key mechanics/types and make those excellect.

Nice streamlined representation of the original.  No spatial element so I would still want the original as much.  This requires a lot of table space but not a lot to carry.  A little quicker to play.  Differs in strategy slightly. Small cards are surprisingly adequate.

Very good game for only little money. It perfectly matches the mechanics and feed of the boardgame to just a bunch of cards. It feels very similar to the boardgame and neverthelss there are enough differences in both games to exist in parallel. For players of complex games this is the game to take with you on holidays.

RATING: 6.5
Quick and more streamlined than its big brother, offering some of the same comboing fun, but lacks its strategic depth and satisfying spatial puzzle. Mostly quicker because you take almost half as many actions per round and, while fewer cards are available, there's no guarantee of their distribution, reducing opportunities for long term strategizing. Just about as fiddly as its big brother too. I would always prefer to play the board gave given the opportunity, and prefer other games of this length over the card game. Solo mode is pretty good and has less overhead than any of the solo variants for CoB, though I still prefer those when I'm willing to make the effort. Keeping it for the solo mode, travel, and to play with my 7y.o. who isnt up to playing real CoB yet. Rating 6 for multiplayer; solo adds .5.

Like a more involved version of The Builders. More engaging however set up and break down takes longer, its a real table hog, and you might forget that you can buy another action card for three silver.

Im glad it has a solo variant but its really just you playing against yourself. No biggies. Still a very good 2+ player game.

RATING: 7.5
I thought it was impressive how different this feels than CoB. My favorite change is the use of cards for random "die" rolls instead of using dice. The mechanism in this game has two effects.

1) "Die" rolls are hidden. Since you hold your two cards in your hand, your opponent doesn't know which numbers you have available.

2) Using a deck of 6 cards to represent your 6 actions each turn allows players to take actions one at a time, drawing a new card each time. This means you can hold onto that number that isn't useful now but might be 2-3 actions down the line. I really liked this and might consider a variant for CoB that implements something similar.

At the end of the day, though, the spatial element that is lost from CoB is missed. I'd rather be playing CoB any day. But this will stay in my collection for a little while because I can easily travel with it.

There is no reason to play this instead of the original. Without knowledge tiles and adjacency there's not nearly enough gameplay to support the baroque and painful process of getting a card into play. (I like baroque and painful, but the game needs to earn it.)

Every turn left me thinking, "This would be great with dice." Collecting items is enjoyable, and matching actions to corresponding numbers is always fun. Drawing the "dice" from the deck, however, takes away the engagement. The game would be better with a less literal analog to dice.

Kastélylapka vagy kastélykártya?
A társasjáték kiadás egyik állomása a már megjelent játékok kockásított/kártyásított/kétszemélyes változatának kiadása, egyben lehetőség is egyfajta „áramvonalasításra” is. Alapvetően kedvelem ezeket a kiadásokat, akkor is ha „újabb bőr”. Az így megjelent játékok többsége egész jól sikerül (van, ami jobban és van, ami rosszabbul). Talán egyes esetekben ki nem mondott cél a vásárlók „csalizása”, hátha megtetszik neki ez a változat és szeretnék birtokolni a „szülőt” is.
A „donorként” szolgáló társas igen előkelő helyezéssel rendelkezik a rajongói listákon, illetve rengeteg jó kritikát is kapott. Ez ideális alap egy jó kártyás verzió létrehozására, de egyben „ingoványos talaj” is, mert az eredeti játék rajongói elég kritikusak tudnak lenni egy-egy ilyen változattal.
Maga a kártyásítás jól sikerült, áttették az elődben található funkciókat, helyettesítették a kockadobást is a lapokon található dobókocka szimbólumokkal. Kettő-négy játékos itt is minden körödben valami hasznosat tud végrehajtani: kártyákat megszerezni, építeni, munkásokat felbérelni, győzelmi pontokat nyerni.
Minden egyes azonos színű megépített 3 épületed után tudsz az épülettípus után járó győzelmi pontot számolni. A különleges lila épületeket vagy az elég magas 6 győzelmi pontért (ami kb. a megszerzett pontok 20-25%-át is jelentheti a végelszámolásban) versenyezhetsz, vagy felhasználhatod azt dzsókerként más triók kialakítására. Nagyon fontos, hogy 3 ezüstért minden fordulóban egyszer kapsz egy „ingyen” akciót, valamint, hogy egy-egy 3-as épületcsoport kialakítása után az 5 fordulónként (mert összesen 5 forduló van egy játékban) csökkenő értékben, de mindig jutalmat kapsz.
Aki először megépíti az adott szín hármas épületcsoportját, bónuszpontot kap, valamint azok is, akiknél minden színből megtalálható egy-egy épület.
Az adott kör elején érdemes beszerezni a számodra fontos épületeket, hogy meg tudd őket építeni. Itt jelentkezik némi interakció a játékosok között, de ez mellett itt is mindenki pasziánsz-szerűen építgeti birodalmát. Sokszor az az érzésem volt, hogy csak a szerencsés laphúzás/lapmegjelenés döntötte el a játékosok közti helyezést, nem az előre tervezés, taktika. Ezt el tudom nézni a játéknak, de érdemes róla tudni, amikor annak megvásárlása szóba kerül.
Mindenképpen előny kedvező árképzése, gyors előkészítése, aránylag gyors tanulhatósága. Egyelőre csak a német kiadás vásárolható meg kis hazánkban, így hozzá az angol szabály vagy magyar rajongói szabályfordítás letöltése javasolt. Sőt elérhető egy egész korrekt szabályösszefoglaló is a játék BGG oldalán a fájlok között. :)
Ajánlom kipróbálásra.

With 2 players it only takes about 20' and for me it is a really good thing :D

This had the same feel as the original Castles of Burgundy. Game even tries to emulate dice rolling with random dice values printed on the cards. The amount of space needed to play this game is mind boggling. Being a card game you would've thought that it would take up less space, but it seems like this game actually takes up more space than the board game. Also our gaming group has played CoB so much that we could get it done in under an hour usually, roughly about the same time needed for this card game. So I don't see the need to own both. Rather keep the original CoB

Even though the only components are cards... there are lots of them to sort and setup the game.  Will probably go faster now that we got the learning game in.  Cards are small but worse is the icons are even smaller for those of us whose eyes aren't what they used to be.

That all said, the essence of the board game is definitely there but obviously simplified... the equiv of knowledge tiles there is only one (which gets you more workers), etc.  With learning game out of the way should be able to crank through a play of the card game in at least 1/2 the time of the board game.

Initial Rating: 7.0 (July 2016)

I love The Castles of Burgundy, it is my favorite Feld of all time, so naturally, I was very keen on trying The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game. I was expecting a good game, but a lesser game than its parent game and that’s exactly what happened.

The rules are very easy to teach if players are familiar with The Castles of Burgundy, in this case you can teach the game under 8 minutes. To players unfamiliar with the previous game, you can explain it under 17 minutes. In general they are easy to grasp.

The art is ok, nothing great but very functional AND most important, it uses the same art of the parent game, so there is a continuity that helps a lot in the game explanation. The game components are ok as well. 

The decisions offered by the game are very interesting, you have too few actions to accomplish too much and I love this. There is luck with the cards, but (most of the time) you can control it via workers and smart planning. It has a light-medium weight. 

The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game plays considerable faster than the boardgame and that’s a HUGE advantage (perhaps the only one that matters to me). Here, I’m willing to play a four player game (a no-no with the boardgame), but I feel it is best with 3 players though. I haven’t played it with 2, I guess it would be a solid experience but in that case I would go for the boardgame instead.

The main difference between both games is that the card game removed the spatial element of the boardgame, and replaced it with a set collection mechanism, I kind of like it.

Both games maintain a similar feel, in the boardgame you roll two dice each turn, here the cards serve the same purpose (each card works twofold, as its regular function and as a random die) and, most of the time, you keep two of them in your hand at all times (allowing you to ALWAYS plan ahead, unlike the boardgame in which players all roll at the same time, so if you already played you cannot plan ahead as you won’t know what will you roll). The cards, somewhat, maintain their function but there is new kind of building, the monasteries. They act as jokers that help you complete the needed sets to score but they don’t have a function by themselves.

The box of the game is very small so it is very portable, however, The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game takes a lot of table space, perhaps even more than its parent game.

Bottom line, I’m not sure why someone normal would keep both games in his game collection (I’m an addict so I don’t count, besides, I need to have all things The Castles of Burgundy :D). The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game is a good game and a good port of the boardgame and both games have a similar feel. There is a lot of game in a very small box and it is cheap as well. I prefer to play the boardgame (which I love, I rate it an 8.0) because I prefer to roll the dice and the spatial element is great (and completely absent in this version) but I will keep The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game, if only, because I love the boardgame, I’m a boardgame junkie and it is a good game on its own. The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game doesn’t replace the boardgame for me in any way.

I don't get those who think this plays "just like" the boardgame. The design is a seriously uncreative attempt to re-create the board game without the spacial element of the player boards and variable area sizes. Without that, what is left besides pretending cards are dice and shuffling cards from one area to another and then another with no real thought or challenge? Even if I wasn't familiar with the boardgame, I would look at this and say "Why are they using cards as dice? Why is building a set of three supposed to be significant or interesting? Why do they make fixing my problems so easy with all these workers and silver? How am I supposed to find this in any way interesting?"

But wait, I guess I stil have those questions anyway.

Fun and interesting adaptation of some of the ideas in CoB to a card game. I think it is largely successful. Building the dice into the cards is smart and creates more of an air of control since you play one of two die results each turn. 

If you're a CoB veteran I'm not sure you'll find much of value in this game. It is simplified significantly leaving much less in the way of strategy and decision making. It's not much faster to play and takes at least as much table space. The one thing it has going for it is the size of the box. If you like games that fit in your purse then this may get some play for that reason.

RATING: 6
Recognizably the card game version of Castles of Burgundy. This is a boon and a bane at the same time. While it has the same tension of being able to use your action dice (cards here) productively and winning the race for bonuses, it fails short in any direct comparison except for portability and to a minor degree playing time. The deficits:

- Increased randomness due to card draws and less selection. 
- Category bonuses are far more luck-based due to the easier achievability.
- Less strategic depth by replacing the knowledge tiles with a single simplified effect of knowledge cards.
- Purchases can be a crapshoot as instead of the central tiles a random selection of three cards is drawn which might or might not fit.
- Scores will be so close at game end that getting lucky one or two times can make the difference.

I'm willing to play the card game again but can't imagine any instance where I wouldn't choose to play the boardgame instead when available. Would deserve a '7' if the boardgame didn't exist.

I will readily admit that this does a good job of porting the board game to a card game format. But the big question is why would you want to do this?

The ridiculous nature of the game is most apparent when teaching it to someone that hasn't played the board game version. Nothing makes any sense! Why are you doing anything that you're doing? "Well, you want to get three cards. If you have a card with this number, you can move it here, then you can move it again with another card..." Those that have played the board game can nod their heads when they make the connection.

But the real question with games like this (I'm thinking of Caylus Magna Carta as well), is why would you choose to play this over the board game? I suppose it is a little bit shorter, but not by much.

They implemented this on yucata so played it a bit. Solo gaming with no set up? Yes, please.

Tht being said, I very much prefer the board version. Having cards also function as dice works pretty well though, really dig that aspect. It means both high and low rolls are fairly distributed, keeps everything compact without needing extra components and just makes great use of space that would otherwise be wasted.

This version does not quite scratch the same itch, and definitely does not offer the satisfaction of seeing your own region develop.

Fun and fast game. It has some connections to it's brother but this game is more about making yourself a little engine by comboing different building rather than finding the optimal tiles to expand your city in the base game. I see playing this game occasionally but it does not replace CoB for us.

Okay game but nothing special.  It's not very inspiring on it's own.  It's makes a difference in the enjoyment of this game to have played the parent game beforehand as the tie in gives the game an extra bit of interest.  I know this because I played the card game prior to playing it's parent, believe or not.  But other than the fact of it's parentage, this is just an okay game that's burdened by it's fiddliness.  This game just makes we want to play CoB.  And I have to add that I'm a big fan of the original game.

In fact each of the things removed are what I loved about the original.  What's left, even by most other's comments, is a game that plays faster and simpler but isn't as fun, exciting, or as satisfying as the original. So I ask:  Why?  If you want to play Castles of Burgundy, play that.  If you don't have time play some other faster and better game and play the full CoB game when you do have time.  If you don't have the space, well this card game takes up even more than the original anyway.

RECOMMENDED INSTEAD:  The Castles of Burgundy.

Not as much depth as the Castles board game. Compared with some card game implementations of board games, the Castles card game tries to incorporate most of the elements of the board game rather than simplifying. The downside is that there are many different card types, but the upside is you get the feel of Castles in half the time.

Very nice take on the boardgame. it feels kind of the same although it is fairly different. I love the boardgame, but really like this one too. depending on the time I have at hand... this one can play really fast. but you still need a big table (maybee even bigger than for the boardgame...), although it is super porable.... scratches a good itch! well done!

It is a table-gobbler. I can fit a 4 player game of its parent game in a table in which I can barely fit a 2 player game of this. While it is fast, and definitely portable (and more enjoyable in parts), this table greediness makes me rate it less than the original.

RATING: N/A
After a video review: The game is small and the mechanics looks interesting. But I was a bit deceived by the game's objective, but more importantly by the cards play.

Because the design of the card would allow in theory the acquired cards to be played as actions like a deck building game. But the action cards are entirely separated from the bought cards that you only collect to simply make set.

I think I would have prefered a deck building game.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

This card game largely maintains the feel of its older sibling although it plays in 1/3 of the time if not faster! Cards are multi-use in that they serve as dice rolls or as what is shown on the card. One is collecting sets of three for the different types of regions to score points and when a card is built - a special action is usually granted unless it is a purple card which can also serve as a wild card. I wonder if purple cards are generally more valuable as a wild card, particularly later in the game. Just like the boardgame, one will be frustrated with the limitations of the "dice roll" and workers are available to help alleviate the problem. Cards are small but the box is also small - smaller than any box I've ever seen Alea produce. This must be the start of the new small small box line. :-) 

Plays well with 2-4 I expect - definitely was solid with 2.

I have to bash this game for having a horrendous rulebook. There are no pictures to tell you which card is which, the setup diagram only shows the cards no one owns and not an individual players' setup the wording in a few cases can make you confuse one term with another, and the rules are sometimes redundant which could lead to accidentally trying to perform something twice.

I hope you really, really like set collection, even if the set collection is inelegant. While you'll see a lot of familiar rules if you've played the board game, if you haven't there's quite a bit for how light the game actually is. It doesn't help that 3 of your possible actions are really situational ,  and that the scoring set collection methods, of the crates, the farm animals, and needing 3 of a color to score isn't thematically tied at all, and so isn't intuitive. The game does require some careful planning of your actions to take the cards you want and the bonuses for being first to complete certain sets add some indirect interaction, so the game is mechanically sound if really point salady. I just think it is even more abstracted than the board game, and I miss the added tile placement aspect. At least the tactical nature of having to make do with what you're dealt with each round makes the puzzle of the solo mode not feel too repetitive.

Un jeu de Feld que j'apprécie assez pour bien le noter, ça faisait longtemps !
Le principal reproche serait des explications un peu trop longues pour un système finalement assez simple, mais c'est principalement dû aux multiples façons d'utiliser les cartes et aux nombreuses actions qu'on peut faire à son tour (même si elles sont toutes simples, rien n'est jamais réellement intuitif - cet empilement de mécanismes est typique de l'auteur).
C'est pas mal, mais un peu compliqué à jouer en dehors du public geek.

RATING: 6
This game is as advertised.  It is the card game version of Castles of Burgundy.  You setup a group of cards that function just like the tiles of different colors in the game.  There are some simplifications, the yellow cards are not end game scoring or special abilities, but provides additional workers to manipulate "dice".  You shuffle cards that have a buildings and dice on them and create a group of 6 cards and flip 2 to choose.  Each turn you flip another and have two to choose except for the 6th round of the turn.  You have to pull down buildings and push them up to your domain.  

The game is much quicker than the boardgames, but the table footprint is very large-larger than the boardgame. However, I like the game a lot and am keen to play again.  It may not have the depth that the boardgames version has but for a quick, light version of a very good game, I think it first the bill.

Although it packs most of the gameplay of Castles of Burgundy into "a small card game", this version adds a lot of fiddliness and is not as elegant as its big brother.

If you're looking for a travel version, this is not exactly it. The game box and the cards are extremely small, but playing the game will bury your game table under an avalanche of cards. A bigger table is almost required to play this small card game than to play the big board version.

its more of a point salad too, which is a negative thing in this instant as you just cant tell why any choice is better than any other
I kinda consider this a filler

This has been tossed to the way side because the classic CoB is just better in every way.

The card game does a surprisingly good job of creating an overall feeling similar to that of standard Castles of Burgundy, minus the spacial aspect, with slightly less forward planning, and with a bit more luck.

The original Castles is certainly a better game, but it takes twice as long, is less portable, and requires much more upkeep with placing and removing tiles. The card game plays smoothly and in about 45 minutes with 3 experienced players. Also, the amount of space the card game takes up has been overstated. It's not that bad, really.

An enjoyable, slightly simpler game than the board game. Instead of dice, you are playing multi-use cards for their dice value, and instead of building up a region you are collecting sets of cards.

I play this with the [filepage=145360]Aaron 2.0 Variant[/filepage] found in the files section.

[u]29-Oct-2017[/u]:  This is the card game version of its older brother.  It does a nice job of distilling the original mechanisms of CoB into card form.  In this game, though, the focus is more on set collection.  You want to acquire triples of a color to score VPs.  Many of the same actions are found here as in CoB, but the spacial aspect has been removed.  It's lighter and quicker than the original game, but it probably takes up just as much table space, if not more, despite using the mini-Euro sized cards.

It's a fun game that comes in a small box with a reasonably small price tag.  The solo game in the box are fine, but it felt like it was missing something.  That's where the Aaron 2.0 variant comes in.  Using those rules, which are very similar to the official solo rules, the player now has some influence over what cards the AI gains each turn.  This provides a small additional layer of player decisions, increasing the replayability of the game for soloists.

Finally played this game and really do enjoy it. Took 2 play-through vids to understand it (thank you, Rahdo and Slickerdrips!) but all is good now. Not that the instruction booklet was bad; I'm just rubbish at written directions. Playing Aaron was tight - he won the first game by one and I won the second game by one - and it is a bit more thinky than I'd like. I always felt like I was making optimal moves then realize I need two "rolls" to complete a move, so next time, I need to be more aware. I do think I was in the mood for a less swingy game than Eight Epics gave me this weekend, though, which may explain my current rating.

Very good implementation of the original board game: plays very fast, same mechanics but more oriented towards the set collection and it doesn't have the spatial element. Does take a lot of table space though, maybe even more than the original. Very enjoyable game though and it plays much faster for the same feeling, though if I would have the time, I'd still prefer the original as it provides more diversity and also adds the spatial element. This is one of the only card game implementations of a board game that are worth to own and play

RATING: 8.15
I have to say I really liked it.

First because it's an easier game to grasp, not that CoB is hard but this one has less things going around so it makes it easier to comprehend and assimilate.
I consider this one a great gateway to the full game of CoB, it's a fantastic way to introduce new players to the game, explains the basics of CoB and then they will be ready to take CoB by the horns when it's presented to them 

I also liked some of the changes to the gameplay:

- You always have 2 "dice" (cards with the dice) in hand to choose what action to do, so you aren't stuck with only one die and that number won't help you to do anything interesting... it can still happen if you have 2 cards with the same dice number but hey at least you had the chance that it would be 2 different ones.

- You take alternate turns, meaning I play one Die to make an action, then you play one, then I play, etc... I don't play all my dice in one turn

The game will be faster than the regular one, specially when playing with more players.

Probably best with 2 players because it plays so quickly and smoothly at that player count.

This was the first time I actually had that feeling, too. Neat card combos, multiple things  to consider, luck screwage and luck mitigation, fulfillment from building up your little empire... it's all in a pocket-sized box. Well done.

Got this in a trade at InvictaCon'17.
Neat little game, with simple rules and apparent card(dice) randomness, but you have many ways to go around it, like buying silver or workers to bolster your buying/building power.
The difference in player skill is apparent from the start though, as I feel it is a tempo and analytical game, where you'll have to think what it's best for you, what you can do to stall your opponents and find ways to go around your assign card/dice/numbers. 
The only downside to it is the fiddlyness with the "so-called" board. In fact, I think this game suffers from the lack one. Instead, we have this god awful display cards, that will inevitably move around and irritate you (++ if you're the "neat freak" type). This game needs some kind of playmats/board, one for the center and one for each player.

RATING: 6.5
Eh. I much prefer the boardgame, even though the cardgame solves one key problem of the boardgame: the wild differences between boards in terms of winnability. (Notoriously, board #8 in C.o.B. is so good that on average it will win in 60% of 4-player games.)

The cardgame has a very weird mechanic, because the cards have dice printed on them... so the game constantly reminds you of its origins. Another problem is that it takes up a LOT of space, so don't think this is going to be any less of a table-hog than the original just because there are no boards.

Still--it's distinctly less satisfying sorting cards into piles than plunking tiles down on hexes to construct your own demesne. Artwork is marginally better in the cardgame but still boring.

Pretty much what I expected. A very competent and enjoyable card game that fails to step outside the shadow of its parent game. The lack of special powers from yellow cards is bothersome, but this game plays in a fraction of the time that the board game does. This is a fine game, but I'm not sure why this needed to exist.

Really good implementation. Certainly feels like the main game, but  its weird how much room it takes up for such little cards! And the animal set collection is counterintuitive to the other Burgundy. Overall, it's a fantastic travel replacement!

Very fun game. I have never played the board version and found the instructions to be a little complicated at first as I had to figure out what the name of all the cards were by just the picture. I've played 4 times, so far three times as a two player game and once as a three player game. I prefer this for two players but it was a great time with three as well. I would highly recommend it as a game. The packaging is cheap and the cards are a little small to handle. Takes up lots of space, it was $14 for me brand new at my local board game shop though. Well worth it.

Fun, quick card game that keeps the spirit of the regular game.  The solo player variant is challenging and is a nice to have when players aren't readily available.  After about 10 plays, I felt I had seen everything I wanted to see in this game.  Sold at DTC 2017.

RATING: 9
I prefer the card game to the board game, I'll state that right up front for all to see. The reasons are simple - it's easier to set up, it's easier to change rounds, and thus it plays faster. Way faster. All that means it's less fiddly. I'll say this here, but I've been saying for awhile and I'll continue to say it for years to come - tokens are not fun. Cards are nicer.

The only thing this game doesn't have from it's excellent big brother is the player boards and their tactile element. While I do miss playing with that portion a little, the speed and ease of play of the card game far outweighs their omission. Despite that, the games are very close to the same, or at least you will get the same feelings as when playing the board game.

As a plus, since I'll keep both anyway, the card game fits inside the big version's box which is nice for shelf space.

RATING: 7
In this card game version, one uses the number on cards (ranging from 1-6) to pick buildings from a supply. You put a maximum of three of these cards under your project. Later you can use cards to put them into your estate. Same types of cards are grouped into threes, so when you complete a triplet, you score points and get a bonus. You can also gain workers, gain gold, sell goods or gain animals with your cards.

It's very similar in feel to the board game.  I think the board game is more strategic as the card game you are limited by what cards are available and face up.  It moves briskly. There are many things to think about, so it has a fresh feel to it. There seems to be a bit more luck than the original game as your rewards are limited to what is face up for animals and goods. Especially for animal scoring you need diversity, but if the face up animals aren't different than your seeded one, it will lead to a lower score.

Overcomplicated set collection game that yanks much of the complexity out of the board game version, but does little to reduce the game's tabletop footprint or setup time. Luck becomes more of a  factor, as you can't guarantee that a card of a color will emerge (unlike in the board game), but the scoring rules all but require that you collect full sets. Play time is moderately shorter, but the game is a shell of its (great) predecessor.

It really succeeds at creating a card replica of Castles of Burgundy. It's very similar, but the game is so much lighter and luck dependent. It only improves it in duration, but not enough to justify the loss in all other regards.

Maybe it was a mistake to make it so similar to the non card version, because now it's very easy to compare them... and choose.

I sold it because I'm always going to be willing to invest those extra minutes to play the non.card version.

[b]The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game[/b] was sold via auction 2/19/17. 

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8 -> 6)[/COLOR]

[i]And after four more plays I soured on COB: TCG and ended up trading it away. After a few more plays I realized that I would much rather be playing CoB and if time didn't allow I owned much better card games. There isn't anything inherently wrong with the card game version, but I couldn't help feeling that it offered a watered down play experience and didn't bring enough new to the table to warrant playing it. If someone requested I would play, but CoB:TCG is not a game I've thought about once since trading it.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]I really need to play this more before coming to a consensus, but for now I'm coming down on the side of really enjoying this for what it offers. Yes I prefer CoB (which I rate a 10), but I am a sucker for set collection games and I enjoy being constrained in the actions I can choose based on the numbers on the cards. What I like about the card game is how quick it plays and the ease of set up comparative to it's big brother, also being able to spend silver to take extra actions offers opportunities to extend your turn since the combos in the card game don't seem as prevalent to me as they are in the dice game. After one play I think there is enough difference in how the game plays out to warrant having both in my collection. 

As a quick aside I've heard plenty of people complain about the amount of table space CoB TCG takes up, but I own plenty of card games that take up a decent amount of table space so that isn't a concern for me.[/i]

Castle burgundy is one of my favorite games. This is a good card-game implementation of the same game. 

I know some people have a problem with the fact that you really only compete about a few points, If you play well you get a few points more than 30, but it's difficult to excel and do better. I usually don't like where most points are yours any way you play and the difference between winner and loser is small. But I don't really agree this is such a game. Yes, you cannot get much more than 30+ points, but if you play poorly you get 20. 

This is one of the games used in EuropeMasters 2016. Usually I don't play those games anymore after EurepeMasters, you get fed up with them, but this I'd like to play more if there were others that agree with me that this is a good game :-)

Interesting for a play or two, but then it reveals itself as a totally unnecessary and far too stripped down version of the original game. Losing the uniqueness of the yellow tiles and the spatial considerations of tile placement rip the teeth out of the game. I found the scoring system, which is based mostly on making sets, to be rather bland. The game is also a mess and a total table hog. Some comments I have read along the lines of "it might even take up more space than the board game" are quite funny as it definitely takes considerably more space. Take a look at some pics of 4 player games near the end; it looks like a disaster. If you have the board game already, I would suggest passing on this one.

I like Castles of Burgundy okay and I'm unsure if I like this version better or not. It's quick playing, plays all player counts well (much much better than CoB) and was $13. What's not to like about it? It still retains a lot of the feeling of CoB without the spatial aspect.

My only complaint was the final scoring rules was not very clear. It took a few read throughs to understand that only 3's of each type score points. I figured it was too little of a payout to trade 3 workers/silver to get 1 point, but the rules did not do a good job of clarifying it.

A fantastic small version of Castles of Burgundy. It replaces the spatial puzzle of the original game with a set-collection mechanic. 3 of any type of card scores one of the 7 types (buildings, caravans, mines, boats, castles, buildings, animals & cloisters)

Acquire and then build each card as in the original game, but each card provides a benefit immediately upon building and then the set provides a bonus when completed. The silver, the card-dice, and the bonuses are handled in such a way that resources are more consistently distributed than in the main game, which is wonderful, because the only downside of the original Castles of Burgundy is that bad dice rolls can lead to a situation where strategy takes a back seat to flexibility because two or three unlucky dice rolls can stall a strategy. If this happens when you've populated your acquisition inventory, you're S.O.L till you roll good dice. So, the original Castles of Burgundy is less strategic than it could be. The card game gives up the fun and complexity of the spatial puzzle, but more than makes up for this by improving the way resources are won, which in some ways allows a broader (if not deeper) strategy in the card game than in the original! 

In fact, I'm now figuring out how to put some house rules in place to alter the original Castles of Burgundy so that it plays more like the card game...

RATING: 8
I like that it plays pretty quickly and the mechanic is very solid. It does have a bit of chance where you might not be able to get the cards you're looking for, but as there's really no big scoring items, it's pretty easy to recover.
As typical of Feld and Euros in general, the theme is both pretty weak and flat. Players who crave for theme probably won't like. Basically, The Castles of Burgundy: The Card Game is an excellent game for that particular niche of players who really crave the heavy Euros and mechanics. I happen to be one such person so for me it's great. That said, I'm only rating it a 7 because in its category of game, there are many others I'd probably prefer to play, but this one would fix into the mix.
One last point, which I've heard mentioned before and is very true, is the game does take a lot of table space. Even playing with just 2 players it's going to consume quite a bit of table area. Crazy for such a compact game package.

If you like the board game it will be hard for you not to enjoy the card game. I still rate it lower since I love the board game and I found this one very good. 7.5/10 vs board game @ 8/10. Very close in rating for sure. There are some nice things about the card game- It plays fast and well with 2p. What I don't like is all of the shuffling. There is a lot of wear and tear on the cards for how much use they get. Might be a problem down the way but for now I am very much enjoying this title.

This is an ok set collection card game, where players sort of draft cards, then convert the cards to sets and try to grab up bonuses for being the first to get those sets.

Pros:
1. Same Feel - The card game feels exactly the same as the big box game. I'm not saying they're similar, I'm saying they're exactly the same.

Summary: Honestly, you can just look at the reviews for the full size game review because these games are exactly the same. If you haven't bought the regular board game, then I'd recommend the card game. It's smaller and easier to carry around. If you already own the regular board game, then there's no reason to buy the card game.

I really enjoy this game. It plays in about 25-30 minutes and offers some great back and forth with some solid combos. You feel really smart when you get all the different bonuses and are able to take a couple of actions in one turn. Most of the points come from set collection, but there are several other ways to score supplemental victory points that can really make a difference in the final score. The solo game is really good as well. I really have no complaints with this game, but I have not played the original board game so I may not know what I am missing. For $10 bucks and a small box this is a very solid game. **Wife:8.5

It doesn't fire the board game, but it plays so much faster and supports higher player counts better, so I can see this getting played more often. My one complaint is how much space it takes up on the table and how hard it is to see what is going on at a glance. SO MANY piles of cards shuffling around the table. I would only look at my opponent's tableau if I was racing for a goal card. I don't mind a little multiplayer solitaire though, and this feels like a solid full game in a wonderfully compact package. Recommended.

This is a very interesting puzzle card game that i enjoy better than original board game version.  Works great as a solo game although the Aaron opponent isn't too hard to out score as long as you don't loose in the early rounds.  The theme is somewhat abstract but I felt it was more present than the predecessor.  This truly is a dice allocation with cards which is interesting in itself.

I had a fun time with this game. It has a definite feel on the regular Castles of Burgundy game. It took me a couple rounds to really get my head around the strategy I should be going for. Unfortunately, it seems to be one of those games with a lot to explain. However, it is a complicated one to play. You should never be truly stuck with nothing to do on your turn. The helpers are easy enough to get to mitigate the luck of the draw. This game gets a little bit of a bad rap with the table space it requires, but I didn't find it that much of a table hog. I'd love to play this again, but the long explanation to teach it might make it a hard sell to my wife and family that I play with the most.

A decent enough game. It certainly feels quite similar to its big brother, but not quite as engaging nor elegant (it's quite a 'messy' game with stuff everywhere). For that reason I don't see many circumstances where I'm likely to play this in a group setting over the original COB. 

Where this game shines is in its solo play. It's a good dose of euro in a small package and a nice timeframe.

I'm not really sure why this game exists, but it is really cool. It really has that CoB feel, and I guess it's faster in both setup and play, but I don't know if it really warrants owning both. On its own, it's a very nice game worthy of a place in anyone's collection who doesn't already have CoB.

RATING: 7.5
I admire the effort to make a card game that actually feels like playing CoB. Unfortunately it requires the same amount of table space (or even more!) and lacks the satisfaction of building your own little kingdom - instead you're just collecting sets. On the bright side, the solo mode is really well done and playtime and setup are significantly quicker than CoB's.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
[1 play] Realistically rating this a 4, despite the "1" that many would be tempted to give  to a game they believe is vastly overrated.

CoB Card Game does not need to exist! A card game version of a great game should either make the game a) less complicated, b) shorter, c) needing less table space, d) some twist to the rules that is innovative, or e) some combination of the above. CoB:tCG does NONE of THAT! Messy. Unnecessary. Ugh.

Despite its small box, this game takes up quite a bit of table space; possibly more than the board game ha!

Does what every card game version of a board game should do... Simplifies it and makes it appealing to less serious gamers.

Does a great job of using the cards to replace the dice rolling to select a card from the display to your project area, or from your project area to your estate. Plus other known actions from it's big brother... take workers (which allow some manipulation of the dice numbers), gain silver, sell goods or covert workers/silver in multiples of 3 into VP.

The main idea is basically to collect sets of 3 cards of each colour. When a triple is achieved, you take a bonus dependant on which round you are on. As per the main game, you still get bonuses for laying a card into your estate. Bonuses are also awarded when you gain a card of each of the 7 colours as well as end game bonus for sets of animals you collect.

This really turns CoB into a more wifey friendly affair, plus taking a big slice off the gametime of the original as well... BONUS.

And a great solo option as well

WAY BETTER than the board game for me... Gives me far less of a headache playing it :)

I think I may like this better than the board game? It basically replicates the experience but gives you a little more control: each turn through the round, you almost always have a choice of 2 numbers to use, and you can hold one back a while to try to do a bit of planning for this round. Areas are also essentially capped at size 3 for everyone (and every color) which makes it easier to finish a variety of colors.

Fun!

I'm pretty firmly on record as saying that I don't usually have very much optimism for card and dice versions of full board games.  I appreciate the need for shorter and smaller form factor games but trying to squeeze an existing game into that form factor rarely has positive results in my eyes.  With some exceptions, I like Roll for the Galaxy more than Race.

Castles of Burgundy is a game I like very much and I have to admit this card game version of it does a great job of dilluting the game down to a 45 minute card game that still feels like Castles of Burgundy.

I would play it if I only had 45 minutes, otherwise I would prefer Castles of Burgundy.

This is a big game in a small box!  First, it is astonishing how much of the board game is packed into tiny cards for a small price point, and this is one instance where the card game version meets, and in some ways, exceeds it's big brother. The game plays fast and delivers fun and satisfaction to all players. There are only two hiccups which need mentioning. First, the rules book leaves a lot of questions (which can often be resolved by reading the rules for the board game version or on the BGG forum). Second, this game takes a lot of table space to play. Having said that, I don't hesitate to recommend this game. It's fantastic.

I'll start by saying it's not a bad game; I had mildly fun playing it.

It feels like Feld added mechanics and overhead every time his design had a weakness. Randomness is limiting; let's add workers. Actions are not interesting; let's add random animals, ore and resources. And all this for a simple set collecting game!
It's all pretty bland like the graphic design. I mean how many shade of brown/grey can we get. Cram it on the smallest card you can with the worst iconography possible. There's even 2 types of green, isn't that the colour that most colour blind player can't distinguish.

Anyway, it plays fast, but I can't see myself playing that ever again.

Hard to rate in isolation. Destined to always be compared to the original. The removal of positioning tiles & unique knowledge tiles is a downside. Demands [b]more[/b] table space, or at least a less predictable amount of space.

I think I'd always rather play (& teach) the original. There's no denying that this is much more compact to transport, which is good compared to the original, but not so good compared to the 4 regular card games you could carry instead.

We play this in a confrontational manner and find it to be a lot of fun.  It seems a touch more Euro than most of our other games, but that hasn't held us back.

The board game this is based on is one of my all time favorite games. And it does a good of turning that game into a card game without changing it too much yet still giving it a slightly different feel.
It didn't feel as deep or replayable as the board version, but it certainly is a solid adaptation.

I can imagine that Alea had in mind for CoB what Andreas Seyfarth did with Puerto Rico/San Juan. Instead, Stefan Feld has managed to take his best game and turn it into a very bizarre card game. 

It's not easier to set up. It's not particularly streamlined in terms of game play. It removes some of the core elements of the original that make it such a delightful, brain-twisting little puzzle (most notably the spatial element). And most bizarre of all: even though the game uses mini Euro-sized cards, the game takes up TWICE THE TABLE SPACE of the board game!

Game play isn't particularly bad. I'd play it under minor peer pressure, but the UX is atrocious. I would never prefer this to the board game version.

I'm really not sure why this game exists.

Game-play, however, is fun. Plenty of choices for two players without too much indirect conflict (I can take those cards you need, but I need them too, so there's interaction but not direct screwage).

Has the same amazing gameplay and feel of the original, but ultimately not as good (but far, far from terrible). 

The silverlings system works better in the original, the knowledge tiles are more complex, placement is more strategic and complex and yet I think it's just as APless as the card game. Also, in the original, the animals are way more interesting as is the interaction.

Some interesting additions in this variation? The dice system (saving a dice for next turn, knowing that you could play it or save and play a different dice), the bonuses are different but interesting in their own way, and the ability to cash in workers or silverlings for points, which makes for interesting decisions whether to save up or use them.

Interesting euro card game with the usual action selection and estate building with set collection thrown in. Quite an impressive solo variant, too. But the rules are a bit on the bad side - card explanations are hard to associate with the correct card, because pictures are so small you can't really recognize them (the buildings at least). And mini cards - I understand why they went for those, but the big stack of action cards is hard to shuffle. Oh, and the rules don't really give clear notions what card is what - you need quite some detective work to get that sorted on your first play. But the effort is worth it, the game itself is solid.

Castles of Burgundy is one of my all-time favorite games. So when I had first heard about this I was cautiously optimistic. But then I started hearing mixed things about it. So I didn't know what to expect going in.

Each round you have a hand of cards which simulate your dice rolls. You will only look at two cards at a time and choose the one you want to use, keeping the other for the next turn (when you draw another second card). Card-Dice are used to take project cards from the central display into your personal depot, used to build a card in your depot, used to sell goods or simply given away for workers or coins.(The Card-dice and project cards are actually the same deck, they simply are used in different ways).

The goal of the game is to build sets of three cards of a type. That gives you some points (depending on type), a bonus if you're the first person to build that color set and a bonus depending on the round they're built in. Bonuses can be workers, coins, animals or goods. Goods can be sold for a point each (but you can sell as many of a type as you have with a single die-card if they are all the same number). There's set collection thing with animals where you want a set of different types of animals. If you ever collect 3 coins you can exchange them for another turn (you draw three cards, discard two and use the die from the third or take it into your depot as a card you can build). Workers just adjust die values like in CoB.

And that's pretty much it. The game has some stuff going on, and it's not bad by any means... but it pales in comparison to the original. I wouldn't mind playing this occasionally, but I'd usually rather play the original.

Each round you have a hand of cards which simulate your dice rolls. You will only look at two cards at a time and choose the one you want to use, keeping the other for the next turn (when you draw another second card). Card-Dice are used to take project cards from the central display into your personal depot, used to build a card in your depot, used to sell goods or simply given away for workers or coins.(The Card-dice and project cards are actually the same deck, they simply are used in different ways). 

The goal of the game is to build sets of three cards of a type. That gives you some points (depending on type), a bonus if you're the first person to build that color set and a bonus depending on the round they're built in. Bonuses can be workers, coins, animals or goods. Goods can be sold for a point each (but you can sell as many of a type as you have with a single die-card if they are all the same number). There's set collection thing with animals where you want a set of different types of animals. If you ever collect 3 coins you can exchange them for another turn (you draw three cards, discard two and use the die from the third or take it into your depot as a card you can build). Workers just adjust die values like in CoB.

And that's pretty much it. The game has some stuff going on, and it's not bad by any means... but it pales in comparison to the original. I wouldn't mind playing this occasionally, but I'd usually rather play the original.

About [thing=191977][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=191977][/thing] (just CoBCG, from now on) is a game about set collection, the little brother of Castles of Burgundy (CoB, from now on). It uses cards as dice and buildings, and emulates a good deal of what CoB is: take buildings, build, ship goods, gather resources, workers, silverlings, etc - all using dice

[thing=191977]CoBCG[/thing] has basically the same feel as that of CoB - the same hardships of dealing with the randomness and options involving the buildings (farms give animals, brown buildings with similar effects of those in CoB, ships giving goods, castles allowing for a one time use of any number, etc), but put in a somewhat different package: it is simpler, lasting for around 1/3 of the time of CoB, now with a focus in doing sets and going more for tatical opportunities than around a bigger and deeper strategy alongside the worries of the spatial positioning.

The replay value is high, due to the random order of the cards, both to the queue of buildings and for the use of the players as numbers.

The production value is Ok for a card game - most of the art is taken from the original game - and the grapich design can be opaque, sometime, but does the job most of the time and with experience, it will be an afterthought.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
Each player receives 6 cards and don't look at them, drawing just two - these are used for the number in the upper part of the card, serving basically as the number rolled in a die. In the player's turn, she uses one card to:
- Take a building. These are placed bellow numbered cards from 1 to 6, with one or more extra. Therefore, if a player discard a card with the number 3, she can take the building bellow the #3 card. There is a limit of 3 cards in the building queue;
- Construct a building. Each card has a number in the upper part of it. To build, the player discard a card that matches the number on the building;
- Take a silverling - any card will do;
- Take workers - any card will do;
- Ship goods. Each good have two numbers on them - the card used must match one of them in order to ship the good. If the player has two or more of the same good, all are shipped together.

The main goal is to make sets of 3 of the same color of building, which will give the player points at the end of the game. Each building has an one time effect when built - the purple buildings can be used as one of the type of buildings to make a set, or be put on other sets, as jokers - but then won't count as purple, for the purpose of taking the bonus points for having build all 7 colors of buildings.

The first person that makes a set of a given color gains 1 bonus point. The first that build all seven colors, gains 3 points, and the second, 1 point. Accordingly to the round a player completes a set, she gains a immediated bonus: gain workers, silverlings, animals, etc.

Animals, unlike in the base game, are worth more the more different types you have - one is worth nothing, two are wort 1, three give 2 points and four give 4 points.

Three silverlings can be used to gain 1 point, or to draw 3 cards from the draw deck and either take one to put in the building queue or used one as a number to take a card from those open.

After everyone uses all their six cards, the round is over. New cards are revealed and a new hand of 6 cards is given to each player. This goes for a number of rounds, and at the end, the person with the most points will be the winner.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
The main one, that will cover 90% of the decisions is: what to do with the numbers in hand. This is akin to the decision of how to use the dice rolled in CoB, and even one must consider the same limit: three cards at the most in the queue. This also branches to what to build, thinking about the one time use of the building, the possible bonuses and the number they require - though this part is easier than CoB since it doesn't add the spatial limitations the board has. And, finally, it also serves to decide when to take workers, silverlings, ship goods, etc;

The other decisions are done less often, but still matter: what bonus for completing a set to take; what kind of animal; what good; and several buildings also offer a decision of what to do with the one time use of their ability. Most of these are given, and easy to make, yet some can offer a little more of a thought.

Overall, the decisions are on the easy side: limited by the dice and what you are already doing, players usually have clear choices (even if not great) and though there is room for some pondering, AP is low, both in occurrency and severity.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Easy enough to teach (though the special uses of buildings can require some questions in the first games);
- Highly portable;
- Good replay value;
- Has a lively pacing, as players do only one action each turn (can be more with the ability of a few buildings), the downtime isn't a big issue, at least with 2 and 3 - with 4 it can bother a little, as there is nothing to do on the other players turn;
- Offers a nice set of (light) decisions in a small frame of time;
- Language independent and colorblind friendly.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- There are several random factors in the game, and luck can help or hinder a lot;
- Little interaction, and all indirect;
- Though the box is pretty small, the game can take a fine chunk of table space - it doesn't work well in small places.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Like seeing a mini-me version of CoB plotting against you - it isn't as evil, worrysome or difficult than its boss, but it sure have more charm. 

In the end, [thing=191977]CoBCG[/thing] is a good game, efficiently doing what it proposes: be a more accessible and agile version, still providing decisions and options to players. It isn't as good as the original, but fills a different niche and is able to stand on its own merits. Recommended.

I enjoyed this one. In the past I haven't been a fan of card-based adaptations of eurogames, trading away both Caylus Magna Carta and San Juan, but this one captured the essence of Castles of Burgundy really well in 1/3 the time.

With limited time at home, I'm also more open to card-based versions of games. Reflecting back on Caylus Magna Carta and San Juan, they also did a good job at packaging their parent games in a smaller and shorter package while maintaining the feel of the game. So I'm opening up more to card versions of larger games.

I'm solidly in the camp of "I like this better than the base game." Of this and Broom Service: The Card Game, this one does the distilling down into a 20-30 minute mini-version of the original miles better.

Choices are quick and meaningful, and what the game loses in complexity it gains in lightning-fast play. I'm not sure there was any way that a card-game reduction of DBvB *wasn't* going to be a huge table-hog, but it's still a great design for all that.

A great, quicker, version of the original.  Just different enough that it doesn't make itself a replacement though, making both games still playable.  
An easy pickup if you are familiar with the original, but I could see some possible confusion for anyone unfamiliar with Feld's die usage (this is a no-dice dice game)

Very disappointed by this game, was hopping for a portable game but it takes up too much space on table, and with 4p the deck empties fast

[+]  
[-] feels like a bunch of disjointed mechanisms, the racing factor is hindered by the randomness of the draw, if everyone manages to "buy" an extra action every turn, the deck empties very fast; the main mechanism of using value of card to see what/where you can do something feels very under-developped since only 2 out of the 6 "actions" are really dependant on the value of the card

Like this more than COB. Does away with the spatial element of the board. Maybe a bit long for what it is. Takes up a good amount of table space. 

Edit: the game goes very quickly on second play, which makes me like it even more. A streamlined COB.

I played a second time live, after having played many times online. I was quite good in explaining the game to the rest of the players, I set it up quite quickly and we enjoyed it. The space taken remains an issue but we had a large table so we had no problems. Vote raised by 1, to 7.5

------------------
an almost faithful rendition of the original but it takes a lot of space, a lot of time for set up and tear down... without adding much. it's not worth, just stick to the original and play it on Yucata.de for a wonderful experience

I like this game quite a bit. It captures a lot of the flavor of the original but plays out in far less time. I wish the box were bigger, though; after sleeving the cards, they barely fit back inside, and I have to use a rubber band to keep the box shut.

A reimplementation of the classic as a card game. Multi use cards drawn for dice rolls used to acquire plans and then to build the familiar types of structures. It is a race to collect sets of three's for points and a special benefit. Each completed set earns a bonus option card that decline in value from best to worst. Strategy in timing the structures with the dice cards while keeping your opponent from completing their sets. Workers used to modify dice. Livestock are a unique set collection for additional points.  Some familiar elements to the original but plays like its own game. I prefer the original.

CoB the Card Game is a little bit lighter and the playtime is a little quicker than the original tabletop game. But as Rahdo notes in his run-through, it takes up a lot of table space. 

It's a good game, and will probably be an excellent Saturday morning or Sunday evening game to play with the wife over coffee. But it's definitely not a replacement for the original. 

Notes of interest: CoB the Card Game includes a solo-variant right out of the box, which is great. Also of note, there is a rule translation error in the English Rules. When completing a set of three cards, the player that completes the set gets the bonus, not ALL players. The translation team really botched that one up!

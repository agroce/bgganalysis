Building game : I found the idea quite good, but now that I've played it, I thought it would have been better. You never get high because there can only be build one bridge on a stick. Maybe I will try to play it false and compare with the exact rules.

Staafjes leggen op een ronde schijf.  Ze mogen niet raken.
Als je een brug kan bouwen over 2 staafjes waar nog niks op ligt, dan mag je nog een staafje leggen.  Zo kan je verschillende niveaus klimmen.
Geen enkel gelukselement.
Mooi, snel, speelbaar met 2 tot 4.  We want!

Built a rough copy of Tasso using leftover 1/2" pine molding and Masonite I had laying around.

It's a very easy game to build, and it is an extremely fun game to play.  Well worth the effort.

The game feels bizarre as at the beginning nothing happens, due to all the space, and then later on you feel stuck setting up your opponent, which isn't that great a feeling.

The original Tasso board is a beautiful decoration, although, too busy if all the pieces are placed on the board.

RATING: 3
A light game of a little bit of dexterity and lots of tactical stick placement and measuring distances. Try to get rid of your sticks first by building bridges across other sticks.

The game is very sensitive to seating order and differing skill levels because it is easy to provide assists to the next player if one isn't careful, so by default whoever sits behind the weakest player wins. With equally skilled players the winner will be determined entirely by seating order, too, since at some point there is simply no longer any space left where to place sticks without providing a bridging opportunity to the next player. Constructive play is not possible, and as that's the primary appeal of a building game that is pretty bad.

Lakota is an abstract strategy game with a dexterity element. Players will stack small sticks, one at a time, trying to be the first to get rid of all of the sticks. When a player is able to stack a stick on top of other sticks, he/she gets to take another turn. Thus, the strategy involves trying to place sticks in a way that will not allow the player after you to get extra turns. In that sense, it almost reminds me of dot boxing. As in dot boxing, you will eventually have to make a play that allows another player to go again, but in this case you play to make sure they get only ONE extra turn instead of many. 

The game scales very nicely from 2-6, but 2 player is probably the most strategic. There is definitely a seating order advantage here and a weak player to your right can give you the victory. Even so, it's such a quick and light game that it's not a huge problem. As players continue to stack their pieces, the wooden circle gets more and more crowded and it becomes tougher to place. Yet the mangled bird's nest of sticks that develops has quite a bit of table appeal. It's good for all ages, and very simple to make your own copy, but it's unlikely to become anyone's favorite game, or even favorite filler.

Whenever two wooden pieces lie close enough to each other to be bridged by a third piece, the player bridging the pieces can lay another tile. What looks like Jenga first doesn't have to do as much with dexterity as I expected. It's more a game of visual judgement regarding distances between pieces. With attentive players the possibilities to lay a tile without leaving opportunities to bridge for the next player will be used completely and at least in larger rounds without a fault on his own one player has to lay a tile in a way that the next player can build a bridge. Who that will be, seems mostly at random. Worse, with non-attentive players the player to the left of the non-attentive player will win.

(Comments based on the Tasso edition - Delighted it has now got the Kosmos distribution and marketing behind it)

An ignored classic of its genre which deserves greater attention.  Elegant, from the packaging which makes it sit comfortably on any shelf to the game design and gameplay.

Restrained simplicity which produces a tense but engaging game which so-far has proved a hit with 2, 3, 4 & 5 players.

Recommended for fans of dexterity games and for those who admire simple elegance.

[b]I have to try this out as a two-player game. With more players, it heavily depends on who you're sitting next to. If the person before you plays badly, you might get to place a couple of extra bridges. On the whole, I didn't enjoy it much.[/b]

Based on one play: There is some fun to be had here and once you realize where blocks should be placed in order to prevent the next guy from be able to place them on top of yours, it gets better. Timing has an effect, as sometimes you don't really have a safe place, but you can always try to minimize the damage. Quick, fun from time to time.

Lakota é simples, mas dá que pensar. É um jogo daqueles em que por vezes é precisa uma fita métrica para verificar se é ou não é possível a colocação de um tronco em determinada posição; mete destreza, capacidade de observação e discernimento suficiente para perceber como se pode dar pouco e garantir o usufruto de muito!

Excellent abstract / dex game, where the rules of piece placement produce a three dimensional shape like a fractal or spiky woven basket. This is spectacularly great and you should buy it -- but bear in mind it's an abstract first and a dex game second.

Un juego elegante y que sorprende por su concepción y su sencillez.

Quizá se queda algo corto en la mecánica de juego y, con únicamente dos partidas, creo que la rejugabilidad no debe ser excesivamente alta.

Great little abstract dexterity game (more strategy than dexterity) -- either place a stick, or place a stick on top of two free sticks and play again. First to place all sticks wins. The goal, therefore, is to place your sticks in such a way as to not create an opportunity for your opponent to get ahead. It plays a little like Dots and Boxes, but with a more satisfying endgame.

There is strategy to it but the dexterity element is more than some comments here would have you believe: there are often opportunities for precarious, sketchy placements, and much of the fun is in trying to spy them in the developing birds-nest and gauge the risk.

The Ludarden edition (Tasso) is beautiful.

A very nice abstract with rules as easy as Jenga.
Probably best as a two-player game since it suffers from "Kingmaking", if someone sits behind a much weaker player.

A family friendly multilayer abstract strategy game. Ever since [thing=9674][/thing] that is something I do enjoy occasionally. So why not try this one?
I certainly like the idea of placing blocks in such a way that spacial insight is rewarded. Unfortunately it doesn't work. At least not with three. After the first few blocks, you come to a situation in which there are no good spots left, so all you can do is place a block that allows the next player to play extra turns. What happens is that one player places 1 block, the next player places 1 or 2 blocks, and then the third player gets to play maybe 8 blocks. This happened a number of times and it feels wrong. I guess that in family environments it does work fine, but with people who are careful and think strategically it doesn't work.

Initial score: 5.5

A game of laying sticks on other sticks, or more correctly, laying sticks on other sticks so the other guy can't lay sticks on those sticks, or any other sticks, or something.

Place a stick either on the board, or between two sticks on the board that aren't already supporting another stick. If you placed a bridging stick, have another go. PLace all your sticks first. It seems simple, but it's all about giving the other player not a single scrap of opportunity.

There's no grand strategy or deep game development here, but there's a really entertaining light game as everyone tries to push the limit in not giving the other guy(s) any advantage (or safe place to play)

(Bought in Madrid, Sept 20, 2010!)

Half topology, half dexterity, this is a really quirky, fun, and interesting little game.  At first we interpreted the rules wrong and allowed "leaners".  Both ways are fun, but I think no-leaners is a bit more strategic.  Leaners really emphasize dexterity and minimize the topological aspects of the game, I think.  They do make for some exciting turns, though!

a nice abstract mixed with some dexterity and some pattern-recognition. simple and interesting, maybe not so fast if u want to spend 10 minutes looking for a little space for ur wooden pieces.
[EDIT]: play it in 2 , if you dare, play it in 3, avoid 4 or more: it becomes boring to wait for other ppl looking for their little space and you only play a handful of times

One mistake by the player player to your right (leading to a structural collapse) gives you the game, and the other players can't do anything to prevent it. Might be ok as a 2 player game; with 3-6 players, seating order wil decide the game.

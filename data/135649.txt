Since Isaac took to King of Tokyo so quickly, I guessed that he would like and be good at this one, too. It's the same basic concept, mechanics-wise, but actually is a tiny bit more complicated than KoT.

This game has wonderful components: a beautiful book-shaped box with a great insert; funny clunky dice and nicely illustrated house tiles.

The gameplay is fast and funny, with a little bit of mean actions when the wolf arrives and tries to blow away an opponent's house.

The basic game is quite simple, and my 4-and-a-half grasps it enough to play without too much aid.

Probably one of the better kids game on the market!

This game is fun.  It's nothing special and you can really slaughter the competition just by getting lucky rolls.  But it's over quickly and has a cute theme for my kids.  I recommend it easily to parents with children between 7 and 12.  My 13 year old liked it, but I think the cute theme component will wear off with a hand full more plays.

Thematically appropriate, Three Little Pigs turns the notorious fairytale into a light filler that abides by the basic rules of fillers (playing in a short time and allowing heavy interaction among players) but sadly plays like it’s missing something: when played, it’s not as enjoyable as I expected it to be.

Purchased on impulse and wish I hadn't. I was excited to bring my daughter a game that says 7+, since she's 7 and sometimes tires of playing games for older children (which she can handle, but doesn't always want to!). Unfortunately, there's not enough going on here to keep my interest, and she's never asked for it independently.

Update: I suggested it recently and we really enjoyed it. Raising score to 6. Update: same as initial comment.

RATING: 7
I just introduced this to my 6 year old who immediately picked it up.  He instantly grasped the meaning behind rolling the Big Bad wolf and foregoing his turn or making decisions to press his luck to avoid it or trying to reroll to get the exact house component he was looking for.  He also made fairly good decisions on getting the best value out of his roll based on if it would give him potted plant bonus points or completing his house for that bonus.  He was also able to teach mommy the rules after playing it a couple times.

For those reasons I bumped my rating up by two.  There is some interest there purely for adults as a quick filler.  But it is meant as a family game and it excels at that.  After several plays we read the story as well to wrap it all up.  I look forward to introducing him to more gaming concepts through this series of games.

In this game we are trying to build certain types of buildings (straw, wood, brick).  We roll dice Yahtzee style to determine what we'll build (doors, windows, or roofs -- two for straw, three for wood, and four for brick).  Once a roof is placed on your building it is considered complete.  There are bonus points rewarded for the most completed buildings, highest building, first to complete a door-window-roof building of each type (straw, wood, brick), and most flowerpots (which are also an extra point each).

If, when rolling the dice, a wolf symbol shows up, that die is locked.  If two or more appear, your turn is over and you spin (or blow) the wheel.  You first indicate which opponent's building you're attempting to blow down, then spine (or blow) the wheel.  The resource the spinner lands on gets "blown" off that building (or removed).

Once a certain amount of piles are depleted (changes per player) the game is over, bonus points are rewarded and final scores are calculated.

This game has been a lot of fun to play with my daughter, and start teaching her about strategy. Between this and Seven Dragons, she's really starting to think about what move she SHOULD make, instead of just the move she WANTS to make. We recently just moved to the more advanced scoring system for this game, and I'll rate this after a few more plays.

RATING: N/A
zelfde principe als yahtzee. dankzij je worp bouw je huizen (deur, raam en dak). als je echter twee of meer wolf symbolen gooit mag je blazen aan het rad en dan vernietig je het overeenkomende materiaal, bijvoorbeeld hout of steen, van het huis van een andere speler.

Het Franse Iello is verdeler van héél wat kleinere uitgeverijen, zo ook van Purple Brain Creations. Deze relatief nieuwe speler op de markt brengt éénvoudige familiespellen op de markt die volledig draaien rond bekende (en minder bekende sprookjes). Ze brengen hun spel in een doosje in boekvorm, zodat je de verschillende spellen uiteraard netjes naast elkaar kan gaan verzamelen. De eerste twee titels waren al in Essen te bewonderen. Baba Yaga is een Russisch sprookje dat ze vertaalden naar een soort memory, maar wij bespreken hier vandaag graag nummer 1 uit de reeks : de 3 kleine biggetjes.

Indien u bekend bent met het verhaal weet u dat de 3 kleine biggetjes een huisje aan het bouwen zijn om zich te beschermen tegen de grote, boze wolf. Twee varkentjes waren lui en maakten snel een huisje uit stro en hout, dat natuurlijk werd weggeblazen door de wolf. Het derde biggetje zou uiteindelijk de dag redden door een stevig stenen huis neer te poten.

In dit spel mag u voor één keer een echt zwijn spelen en probeert u ook de beste en stevigste huizen te bouwen. De speler die op het einde van het spel het meeste punten verzamelt in de vorm van afgewerkte huizen (ééntje met een dak) en enkele opdrachten omtrent het meeste huizen, het hoogste huis, de meeste bloempotjes op de tegels en huizen volledig opgetrokken uit één grondstof, wint dit éénvoudige tussendoortje.

In een beurt krijgt een speler drie dobbelbeurten waarin hij mag kiezen welke dobbelstenen hij eventueel opnieuw gooit. Enkel wolven moeten opzij worden gelegd. Indien er twee wolven verschijnen, moet de speler een wolvenronde spelen, zo niet dan kan de speler aan z'n huisje bouwen en een deel uit de voorraad nemen. Afhankelijk of hij ramen, deuren of daken gooide, neemt hij het overeenkomstige stuk:
- 2 dezelfde dobbelstenen geven recht op een strooien onderdeel
- 3 dezelfde dobbelstenen geven recht op een houten onderdeel 
- 4 dezelfde dobbelstenen geven recht op een stenen onderdeel
(je mag eventueel ook twee delen bouwen indien je rol dit toelaat, bv. 2 ramen en 3 deuren = 1 strooien raam en 1 houten deur)

De bouwregels zijn op zich relatief simpel, een huis begint met een raam of een deur. Je mag zoveel ramen in een huis hebben als je wil en mag steeds een deur onder de reeds geplaatste ramen stoppen. Eens je echter een dak op je huis zet, is het huis afgewerkt en mag je geen onderdelen meer toevoegen. Het maakt niet uit dat je huis uit verschillende grondstofsoorten bestaat, maar er zijn bonuspunten voor huisjes in één soort natuurlijk. Je mag zo veel huizen naast elkaar bouwen als je wil, maar enkel de afgewerkte (dus met dak) zullen punten opleveren op het einde van het spel. Dat einde komt er overigens zeer vlug, want eens een aantal stapels van huisonderdelen zijn opgebruikt (afh. aantal spelers) eindigt het spel na die ronde.

Indien een speler twee (of meer) wolven gooit, volgt er een wolvenronde. De speler duidt een huisje van een tegenspeler aan, blaast tegen een rad en verwijdert alle huisonderdelen van het aangewezen huis van de tegenstander die overeenkomen met de grondstofsoort (stro, hout of steen) waarop de pijl stopt. Indien er enkel een dak overblijft, stort ook dit in.

De spelers krijgen punten voor hun afgewerkte huizen, zijnde 2 punten voor een strooien onderdeel, 3 voor een houten en 4 voor een stenen. Daarnaast worden er extra punten uitgedeeld voor de opdrachtkaarten (zoals hierboven reeds beschreven). Dit is onmiddellijk het volledige spel, er is ook een eenvoudigere versie mogelijk waarbij je de opdrachtkaarten weglaat en enkel nog punten extra krijgt voor verzamelde bloempotjes. The three little pigs is niet meer, maar ook zeker niet minder dan deze beschrijving. Een imprESSEN volgt ongetwijfeld snel.

The blowing spinners are fantastic!  So much for the good.  I hate everything else about this game, from the random luck of the dice all the way to the targetted attacking of opponents.  Actually, that's pretty much everything right there.  If I see this game again I will know to hide away from its suckiness in some sturdily built bomb shelter.

For kids this is just excellent. When I started playing with my five year old, she only wanted to build brick houses to keep the wolf out. Now she is making fairly complex strategic positions based on the goals and what other players are doing. She's learning the basics of probability as well. Excellent game all around. Only the included storybook is lacking as it's not written particularly well and there are a number of typos.

Although this game is aimed squarely at kids, it's actually more complex than a game like King of Tokyo, with more meaningful decisions to be made during play. Highly recommended.

Great child's game based on Yahtzee.  You build houses of brick, straw, wood and roll two wolves and you get to try to blow your neighbor's house down (using a spinner).  Lots of decisions, different paths to victory. The game runs out just in time, so it's one of those race-to-get-things done situations.  Very carefully designed, and very analytical for a game easily learned by kids.  Comes in a cute book-box, with cute spinner, so works at all levels.  I was surprised how this managed to keep most of the elements of adult games with full child theme and fun.

This is the #2 game in the Tales and Games series for me.  It has custom dice and a cool set of hay/wood/brick tiles that you can strategically build to withstand assaults from the wolf.  There's a classic "yahtzee" style of dice rolling here that almost makes this "King of Tokyo" for kids.  Be forewarned that there's definitely a "take that" element in this game that could upset younger players if they don't like being targeted to have their house blown down.

Great game for the whole family. My grandmother (over 70) plays it with my 9-year old sister. They both have fun. And that says a lot about the game. Have played it with 2 to 5 players. Easy to get into, it's a great introductory game for kids if they have never played a board game before. Plays in 15 minutes and it's a lot of fun. Cool book-like box.

This game is quite the surprise.  I haven't played it with kids, but it is a wonderful, incredibly fast, light game for adults.  At first, the decisions seem pretty basic, but after a couple of plays, you begin to realize that there is much more depth than it first appears.  Playing with the "advanced" scoring cards is a must.  The game is also incredibly short and works surprisingly well with 2 players.

I'd give The Three Little Pigs a 2 on the BGG scale (wouldn't play again). I didn't think this game was fun or great, but I don't like luck-based games and I am also definitely not in the target demographic (kids and families).

For the target demographic, I'm guessing this game will be more of a 6, 7, or 8 (like it, love it), depending on the ages of the players. The Three Little Pigs is a light family game and people looking for this kind of game will probably get a lot of enjoyment from it.

Fun dice-roller that the kids (3 and 5) really enjoy.  End game conditions are a bit weak - sneak up on you - so we play that you keep going until you get a dice result that you can't get anything with.  Extends it a bit and you can better see it coming.

Better than Baba Yaga.

Stavo per comprarlo ma per fortuna prima ho deciso di provarlo. E' vero che è un gioco per bambini, ma devo dire che comunque è proprio bruttino e banale (gioco con la meccanica dello yahtzee). Simpaticissima l'idea del soffio in tema con la famosa storiella dei tre piccoli portcellini, ma meccanicamente la rondella del soffio non è pratica e funzionale, specie per un bambino. Bellissima invece la confezione con l'idea del libro che devo dire è la principale attrazione che mi ha fatto pensare a lungo di prenderlo.

This is a faster, lighter version of King of Tokyo which relies less on targeting other players and so hopefully causes fewer actual fights when played by kids. The theme and absence of any special ability cards make this a bit more accessible to non-gamers too.

Solid kids game that can be taught to as young as six years olds. Traditional Yahtzee style rolling, trying to collect the three different parts of a house to finish as many houses as you can while trying to avoid rolling two wolves, which cause you to lose your turn but also allow you to potentially blow down another players' house. The difference in the hay vs stick vs brick is the rarity or odds of the wolf blowing down that building type. End game is won by points depending on building type, completed buildings and the number of flower pots. Pretty easy but a very nice afternoon distraction.

RATING: 5
I'm not really a huge fan of the Yahtzee mechanic, and this is one of the worst games I've played in the genre.  Basically, you were trying to build towers Palazzo-style, but the tiles were limited, so eventually getting certain die faces meant nothing happened.  If you rolled wolves on your dice, then you got to destroy other people's stuff.  If you finished your towers then they scored points, but if you didn't they scored nothing, and the game ends very suddenly, making it very swingy at the end (especially as people are blowing up your stuff).

(2 plays)

Great production quality, fun game for up to 5 players. Gets a bit tight with that many, but it's not really meant to be very thought provoking either. I'd definitely play this game again, but I don't think I have a desire to buy it now that I've actually played it. Silly fun for all ages.

RATING: 7.1
A simple Yahtzee clone with a twist. Roll dice and "spend" them on house pieces. I bought this game for my 5 year old daughter, but my 8 year old daughter ended up being the one that wants to play often. 

The dice are broken up into two colors (white and black) only the black dice have a wolf icon. We found we rarely roll two wolves, triggering the "blow down the house" phase. This is disappointing that it doesn't happen more often.

A solid kids game, and one that causes them to think a bit about dice allocation and pushing their luck.

Great game to play with the kids.  First game went a little long because I kept returning the "blown down" tiles back to the pile, but once I corrected that, the game moves pretty fast.  My 6 year old slapped us silly last game, so it's easy enough for young kids to play against adults fairly.  Only issue that comes up is when you roll wolves and the wolf shows up, the player chooses which house gets attacked, so it can get a little "gang up on the leader" at times.

Cute game of building houses of straw, wood and brick as per the old fable.

Roll 5 dice, set aside parts of the house you want, re roll other dice up to 3 times. If you roll a wolf, you can't re roll that die. Roll 2 wolves, then you have the opportunity to blow one of you opponents houses by blowing on the spinner of luck...

1 play, 2er

A very cute press-your-luck dice game in a terrific book-shaped box. I had thought I'd be annoyed by the Wolf destroying houses semi-randomly, but in practice it didn't come up very much at all!

Fun filler.

--- Summary ---
There are 3 sets of door, window, and roof tiles: straw, wood, and brick. Each type has 4 tiles.

On your turn, roll the 5d6 up to 3 times. These have 2 door, 2 window, and 2 roofs pictured; except 3 dice have a wolf instead of a roof. Wolves may not be rerolled. If you roll 2 wolves, you try to blow someone's house down: point to a house, spin the spinner (which has 3 straw, 2 wood, and 1 brick wedge): all parts of the house matching the type you spin are returned to stock! If you didn't roll Wolves, may use your dice to collect the matching type of house piece: 2-of-a-kind for straw, trip = wood, quad = brick. A house may start with a door piece or window, and may have multiple window levels, but once a roof is added the house is done.

The game ends after 2 stacks of tiles are empty. Players get points for their complete houses only:
1. pictured flowers (1 VP each)
2. 1 VP per complete house
3. 2, 3, or 4 VP for each tile (for straw, wood, or brick)
In the variant rules, instead of (1) and (2), score bonuses for tallest house, most houses, and most flowers; and the first player to complete a house of 3+ floors and only one material type gets additional bonus (for each of the 3 types).
Most VP wins!

Had heard that this is a kid's game that is also fun for adults, but that is not the case at all. I don't even see how a child would enjoy this. The spinner barely works and the game would be much better if the spinner was replaced with a die. Between the dice rolls and the spinner, most of this game comes down to pure random luck with no way to negate bad dice rolls. 

Sold.

Could maybe reach a 6 but the fact that it is also so contary to the theme makes me take away some 0.5 points of rating: you can build a brick roof over a straw foundation... come on!! you can build a foundation after you built the windows....fuuuu!!

Simple enough, great for teaching children the "yatzee" mechanism in a theme they love

Another push-your-luck dice variant. Just enough decisions to be interesting.

Probably a great kids game. Unfortunately, my kids are now old enough that this style of game will never hit the table again - so my theory isn't testable.

Cute art and cute concept, but this game has a rich-get-richer problem: if you get lucky and grab the lead, you can then try to roll wolves and blow other players' house down. The players trying to catch up with you don't have that luxury however.

This is a very cute, family-style, press your luck dice game. I would recommend this to just about any family that want something fun and simple to play. The game also makes a great gift for kids. Personally, I already own a handful of Zoch's many great dice games, and King of Tokyo and will pass on the game, but would gladly play someone else's copy.

Simple, super-fast, and enough fun that an immediate replay may be in order when you finish the game.

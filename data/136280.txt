I'm not a fan of speed building games, but this one wasn't too bad.  Stressful, yes, but it was kinda innovative as well.  Excellent box insert!

RATING: 7
A nice dexterity game that matches the unique factor of a semi co-op that works. It looks nice and the puzzle is made so much more fun with the factor of trying to convey what is going right or wrong with your partner.

Also all players will play with each other twice thus a balance is achieved on skill level. Downside is the puzzles do get easier as you learn the game and then it just becomes a time issue but that is still fun. 

Overall recommended especially for schools, kids and couples.

Great party game, requires fast thinking and causes lots of laughs.

Almost everyone I teach it to, thinks  oh come on that's an easy game... aaaand then comes the dreaded red block! :P

Fun thing is that most players try to solve the puzzle even after the time is up.

Really nice game and a great idea of the 3d logic aspect. Must have in a party collection!!

An interesting fresh idea and "puzzle challenge" for sure, for two players to place the blocks in the correct orientation, using opposite sides of a card which illustrate how the puzzle should look from one side, or the other, in as little time as possible.  Yet, I don't have much of an interest in playing La Boca much beyond say the first 20 minutes, and as such, it is a 6 at best.

La Boca is quite unique in my experience: no other game that needs a combination of quickness and spatial intelligence was ever capable to engage me so much (not that I tried many, anyway...).

Probably the reason lies in the fact that you play cooperatively in pairs, and even if one freezes and can't find a way to solve the puzzle, the partner can help.

For this reason, final victory goes to the player that can solve the puzzles more quickly AND communicate better!

The rules are so simple to be quasi non existent, so La Boca can be thaught to virtually anybody in less than a minute.

Another great, clever design by the Brands: a design duo that will surely produce other interesting games in the future.

A semi-coop puzzle exercise with friends, testing your spatial element. Got it second hand at a very good deal, I probably will not pay full price for this. However, I love to pull this out from time to time when I'm in the mood for puzzles. High replayability, you will not remember those puzzles you solved before definitely. Sometimes, it's fun just to play this to see how many puzzles you can solve with your friends in a set amount of time instead of worrying about victory points.

A cute speed puzzle game, perhaps best described as multi-player Ubongo/Blokus 3D.  It's just too simplistic, and I'd almost always rather play strategy games.  The partnership aspect (only 2 people play at a time) adds a bit of unwelcome downtime (~3 min/round) but longer if your color doesn't come up.

RATING: 7
Unless you don't like spatial games or the pressure of racing against a clock, I'm not sure what there is not to like about La Boca.

Players work in partnerships, sitting across from each other, to build a structure that looks a certain way from their side of the structure.  The problem is, that while players can communicate all they want about what their side needs to look like, they can't actually look at their partner's diagram.  The faster they solve the puzzle, the more points they get.

With the exception of some very minor building rules, that's really all there is to it: quickly building a structure that appears to be correct from both partners' vantage points.  Super simple and super fun!

The game is, on the best cards, all about trying to visualize what your partner is trying to do, so that you can help them achieve it without messing up what you are trying to do.

The advanced game is where it's at. Good idea to start with the basic to figure out how to play, but trying to hide that red block can be hilariously stumping.

Haha! I just saw at the game’s page here on BGG that there is actually a *theme* in this game… Wow, I’m baffled by this! Somehow, it’s about building aesthetic new apartments/houses in Argentina?! Compared to this, Stefan Feld’s game ooze theme… Really, chess or checkers has more theme than this game. 

Having said that, it’s actually not a bad game. It’s an abstract in which you team up with one of the other players and try to place the buildings blocks in a way that they resemble the picture you’re looking at, but at the same time your opponent needs to do the same from his side of the board, and you only have 1 of each piece, so you need to place them correctly while communicating about what to do! The game actually reminds me about one of the tasks from Enigma, but in La Boca this is the entire game. As a real game I don’t think it has legs, especially not since you get points depending on how fast you finish it, but of course, if this time element wasn’t a part of the game, it wasn’t really a board game but more like a normal boring puzzle.

One of the worst things about La Boca is that it says it can be played with 3-6 players… We played La Boca with 4 players, and the downtime is pretty bad – you have absolutely nothing to do when it’s not your turn. I guess I would play it with 4 players max, and I think 3 is the best number. Or, actually I think it would make for a good 2p game with my wife, who seems to enjoy these kinds of games.

RATING: 7
Pleasingly tactile game in which you and another player work together to construct a building.  Because every player is paired off twice with every other player, and because you can easily swap back and forth between the difficulty levels, it balances out groups of differing skill levels very well.

Great components, including a bunch of bright wooden blocks and a box insert that becomes the playing surface.  

After half a dozen plays, it's starting to feel samey to me, but I suspect it'd have a longer life with families.

RATING: 4
This is a 3D game of constructing a pattern using a set of blocks of various shapes, sizes and colors. Each player conducts this with a random partner, and they score points upon completion of the given "puzzle" based on how quickly they completed it. The trick is partners have a separate "view" of the puzzle from their position, and cannot look at their partner's view in order to complete it. It takes good communication and fast thinking. 

It's a good enough game for a lighter one, and doesn't last terribly long.

Love this game. Lots of people compare it to 3-D ubongo. Since I don't know what that is.. I will say that it depends on who you are playing with in this game. People who are visual style learners, or can easily take 2D objects and translate them to 3D do well. Remember to communicate with your partner at all times. Make sure the time keeper doesn't get distracted easily.

Whooo-hoo!  Once in a while there comes a game which feels all fresh, new & exciting.  Despite the stupid title, "La Boca" is a really fine, innovative, fast cooperative game.  Two players sitting opposite to each other, place colored building blocks in order to arrange them accoriding to a certain pattern depicted on a card,  The twist is, of course, that the pattern is different on each side so that players must communicate about which blocks they need to see where.  Highly recommended!

RATING: 7
This is a really fun and innovative party game which combines speed and spatial skills with your ability to work in a partnership with another player. Fear not though, this game works just as well with odd numbers of players. In fact, each player will be partnered twice with each other player in a random rotation. Partners score the same amount, so kingmaking is not really an issue. As you can tell, a lot of thought was put into the actual scoring structure of the game, which is a contributing factor to this being the quality of game that it is. But the true innovation comes with the race against time to play "3D Tetris" with the assistance of your partner. Each of you has only one side of a 2D view of the structure and must work together to complete it in 3D. It's very intuitive when you see it in practice. I've had great success in introducing this game to gamers and non-gamers alike.

We haven't played strictly according to the rules yet, but it has been a lot of fun just building the various constructions. While you could solo this, communicating with your partner is part of the fun.
We've enjoyed competing as teams with the timer. Some non-gamer friends tried it with their family and had a blast. I think Eric Martin is right. This game has Spiel des Jahres written all over it. (SdJ recommended List in the end)
I'm only worried about replay-ability after we get through the pack of cards. However, each card has four patterns.
Fun game for the right people. Not a gamer's game of course, but more of a 30 minute distraction. Perfect for families.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (August 2016)

Reading La Boca´s rulebook, I thought the game was going to be very bad, however, I was pleasantly surprised by it. We had lots of fun playing it.

The rules are very simple, you can explain them under 2 minutes. Gameplay is also short, around 30 minutes with 4 players. The game´s components are nice and they look great on the table.

The theme is nowhere to be seen, it is pasted on. 

La Boca is an abstract game in the vein of Ubongo 3D, but superior IMO. Love the team (temporary partnerships) aspect of the game, this is by far its best feature. At first the spatial puzzles were hard and finishing them on time was a real challenge, but after some practice you get better rather quickly. Now even with the hard difficulty, the game isn’t very hard (I’m very bad at spatial games, but here you can rely on your friends to help!), however, I like the speed factor and how you win more VPs if you finish the puzzle quickly. Due to this, victory will probably go to the most proficient player and I approve!

Best with 4 players. I don’t think I would like to play it again with 6 players. Downtime is too much for such a simple game.

Bottom line, I appreciate the novelty of the game. Inka and Markus Brand always design fresh games and I respect them a lot for that. At first I thought I was going to keep the game in my game collection, but after 3 plays my desire to play La Boca took a plunge. It is way too light for me and I felt the plays were very similar (low replay value). I already sold my copy of the game although I’m open to play it again in the future. La Boca is an excellent family game.

This is a fun, light game.  One in the group was a bit confused but, finally came to terms with depth perception issues.  I like how everyone gets to partner up with everyone.  I'd like to see that in other partnership games.  Good times!

Two players see different sides of a 3D pattern of blocks. Race to fill them in. It seemed fairly easy to me with the occassional more challenging pattern. We didn't use the red block which would make it harder. This seems like a fun game for the family or as a filler.

Very enjoyable game, great material and fun idea. It is easy to understand and can be learned quickly, also by non-gamers. 
However, I have two points of criticism: first of all, if one of the two players is much weaker than the other, the cooperative element really suffers, as the stronger player can completely take over the building process or has to "restrain" himself (severely). Additionally, after a few games now, I feel like the level of difficulty can differ a little too much between cards that are supposed to be equally hard.

It's fine, it was fine for the team-building day we played it on (playing twice with everyone else in couples, communicating a lot) and maybe my kids are going to enjoy it later as well, but I'm not sure I would have bought it, had I played before.

This is a nice game for young kids to learn spacial recognition in a way that is similar to 3D version of Tetris.  [It's also a nice adults game of having a few beers/drinks and see who is still capable of making the correct pattern in an efficient amount of time.]

RATING: 7
Highly recommend this one as I found it a hoot to play.  Temporary partnerships with everyone around the table exist as you build skyscapes that are different from both perspectives but work out using all the pieces.  This game is both a challenging puzzle and challenging in the teamwork aspect.  Some puzzles are definitely simpler than others.  Married couples may not want to play this one as you may end up "yelling" at each other when you play as a team and fare poorly...;-)

Very interesting semi-cooperative realtime puzzle game.  You team with each of your opponents where each can see a view of blocks from their perspective.  You must work together to organize the blocks so that it works for both sides of the board.  You are timed and the faster you finish the more points you get.  I have always had fun with this game.  

Great for families.

I liked it, but wasn't as blown away as everyone else. The way the partners can each only see part of the puzzle is the best part. The rest of it (blocks, speed) is more conventional and less compelling.

Look up photos of the La Boca neighborhood. It really looks like what you build in this game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Best couple vs. couple game I know of (ok, along with Tichu).
La Boca is great game, especially if you want a couple vs. couple game. It's all about teamwork! Basically it's like a lot easier Ubongo 3D, except you're building the pattern together and only see one side, which has its own challenges. In the end I still prefer Ubongo 3D puzzles as they're way harder so the replayability is better. Puzzles aren't everything that matters though, as La Boca beats Ubongo in terms of sheer fun. La Boca is way more interactive and involving. Ubongo is pretty solitaire experience where you just compare scores in the end. Basically - with strangers, for pure gameplay, I'd play Ubongo, and with friends this one.

2-Player Comment:
*Not at its best, but works. You play as co-op trying to beat your own scores.

Excellent "party" game with a group of 4-6 players.  Very friendly to both casual and more serious gamers, easy to teach, excellent components, and plays in about 5 minutes per player.  This game has gone over very well with everyone we've played with, even folks like myself who typically aren't overly fond of time-based games.  Fantastic interaction among all players.  This has quickly become a favorite go-to opener for a game night, or as a quick filler.

Update: After many plays with various group, still really loving this one although I've decided, if possible, to avoid playing with 6 players simply due to length.  Going from 5 to 6 players adds 12 more overall turns and always feels like it's dragging at the end.  At 4-5 players it's excellent and I wish it was back in print so I could recommend it to friends.

Needs a proper play at 4p before I can rate it. Noel and I just went through a couple of cards as an exercise and it was actually kind of fun.

Played several times more with a variety of player counts. In all of these, we ignored the proper player selection and score-keeping, electing to play it more as a round-robin activity. Thus played, it's very entertaining. The lower setup time in such a procedure makes it ideal as a filler.

A genius of an idea for a game.  Think of a cityscape.  One view you may see a certain building, another view that building might not be seen anymore.  

Two people partner up with a bunch of wooden blocks.  Each block is shaped a bit different (some are the same shapes as well), and each block is a different color.  Each partner sits across the table from eachother and a card is drawn that depicts two different images, one is the cityscape partner A is creating, the other side is depicting the cityscape partner B is creating...WITH THE SAME BLOCKS ON THE SAME SURFACE.  You are screaming what you can see, and where to put blocks.  Everyone partners up with everyone else and depending on the time it took you to solve your puzzle you score points, most points wins.

The game is super non gamer friendly is a real hoot.  Excellent.

***** Preliminary Thoughts *****

It's really a 2 player game. Adding more players adds wating time (they just comapre their results and see who did better).

I'm not sure wether I would like it or not, but it seems to be one of those games whose appeal is reduced dramatically after the first couple of plays.

Still, it's an original game and it deserves a try!

Less game than I was hoping for (and the theme exists in name only), but this is still a nice, light cooperative/competitive game for all ages. It's basically just Make & Break made cooperative - which actually adds a lot to the game. A surprising amount of complexity can be hidden in the simple puzzles presented on the cards - especially in the more advanced ones, and pairs of players are tested on how well they can communicate quickly. The mechanic for making sure all permutations of player pairs get a chance (and making it possible to compete for total scores) is simple and effective. There is some downtime as only 2 players are playing the game at a time, but the rounds are so short that this isn't an issue (and most people are cheering the players on anyway, so it's still fun watching).

This is a cool changing-partnership 3-d puzzle game. There are a bunch of colored wooden blocks in varying sizes and shapes. Also, 2 decks of cards -- easy or hard -- showing different configurations on either side of the card. On your turn, you'll partner with someone else (during the game, every pair plays together twice). On your turn, a random card is revealed such that each partner sees only one side. Sitting across from each other and working together, you lay the blocks such that the view from your side shows only the blocks pictured on your side of the card (and nothing else). Each partner scores VP based on the time required (shorter time = more VP). At the end of the game, the player with the most VP wins!

This was a pretty enjoyable filler, although it's tough when you're seated next to your partner (on the same side of the table): hard having the card and all the blocks in a convenient location. Still, surprisingly fun game!

A fun little semi-co-operative brick building game. It falls in to the same game space as something like Uggtect and both games have some replayability issues. I think my main issue with La Boca is that one side of the puzzle often seems to be much easier than the other so with varied abilities in the team, you can get massively swingy results. There also doesn't seem to be much in the way of balance between how easy the 'easy puzzles' are. Some are clearly easier to construct than others.

All of that rather spoils the game as a competitive beast, but played for laughs (as it probably should be) it's pretty fun.

This game is light, and fast, and fun.  It's very Musical Chairs though in that it sometimes takes a minute to get everyone in the right spots to play each round.  The iPhone app makes this one much easier and faster to play, especially if you pay the $1 to have it do the match-ups for you.  Which is worth it.

I'm definitely not a fan of [thing=46396][/thing] simply because I'm spatially impaired, and [thing=46396][/thing] requires it a lot.

[thing=136280][/thing] is different for one reason: you play in teams of two. So, even if someone "freezes" and don't know what to do, and what goes where, someone can actually help, and in two, maybe the composition can be made still fast; and even if both fail, at the very least you will be able to share the deception.

The idea of the game is this: each player will be paired with everyone else two times in the whole game (so, for instance, in a four players game, everyone will have 6 turns of play). After the duo is drafted, a card is taken from the stack and this card has a image on both sides - one player will have to put the blocks in a way to make their side be the same as the one depicted - the other player will do the same, but, of course, trying to make his side meet what is asked for. Since the blocks are shared, is important that they are placed in a way that works for both sides - sometimes this means showing part of itself on both sides, other times will be hiding it from one or both sides (since all the blocks must be used in all the compositions, so, eventually the team will have to hide completely a block whose color isn't showing in any of the sides). Also, the blocks can be put in a way that one or more of them are in the front, others in the back - they don't have all to be in a perfect square/cube/rectangle - this makes the composition more of a challenge.

Anyway, after the card is taken and put in its place, the timer is activated. The faster the team makes the composition of both sides, the most points they will get - both players always get the same amount of points. If the construction isn't complete in 2 minutes or if the the team stop the clock but there is something wrong, the players get zero points. 

At the end, the player with the most points will be the winner!

[thing=136280][/thing] proved itself as a interactive, fun and tense (but still light) game. It ins't a game for everyone (if you mind playing against the clock, with other players cheering against and teasing), and its greatest flaw is the downtime: playing in 6, it is possible to have many teams play while you watch - and this can go for 10, 15 minutes (considering table talk, preparation and actual play). But since I have fun seeing others and bantering, this is a non-issue for me.

Awesome game. If I were to make a list of top 5 puzzle/speed games, this certainly is one of the best along with any Ubongo (3-D version especially) and Just in Time to name just a couple.

This is a fun spatial/building puzzle on a timer. Players are paired up with revolving partners. Points are awards for time remaining when the puzzle is completed. For the "easy" puzzles we put the longest puzzle piece in the open hole on the side to prevent smaller pieces from getting knocked in it.

the basic idea is quite nice. However, with many players there is some down time as only 2 players can solve the puzzles at the same time. Also, it is a bit painful to move the box between the active players every time. Finally, I'm not sure how many plays the game holds, before starting to be repetitive.

This is basically two player Make 'n' Break.  I rated MnB just a 6.5.  It's a nice family game, but it's not much fun watching one person go against the clock.  La Boca changes all that.  Two people play at the same time, working together.  You play everyone at the table twice.  Person with the highest score, based on how fast they were each time, wins.  

Eric Martin was right - this one could easily win the SDJ.  No, it is not deep at all.  This is a family game.  It's not something you're going to want to play for hours or over and over.  It's a good 30 minute or so game that you'll enjoy bringing out from time to time.  A social game.  I give it a 10 for what it is - a great family game that's fun to watch and play.

This is a unique spacial board game, and a co-opetition game, as each round you are cooperating with a partner to recreate the design of blocks on a card, but each partner is only allowed to see a separate perspective, thought they can talk and discuss with each other. Great game to develop cooperation skills in kids, as well as a challenging game for adults. Also great for young kids, if you eliminate the time-pressure element.

Was surprised how fun this game was for a group activity.  Works well as a fun activity that you can socialize around as only 2 people are playing at once.  Still moves quickly despite that fact.

incredibily original, wild, fun, simple entertaing game.
I adore the "collaboration by couples" mechanic, a truly genial creation. The length of the game grows quadratically with the number of players but who cares? you will have plenty of time to try yuourself and while the other are playing you can still enjoy the show.
I'll play it often if given the chance. truly amazing!

Really fun team based co-op Tetris meets Tangrams(the puzzle game with weird shapes).
You are time with a team mate to build a multi colored wall out of wooden blocks. Your side looks different than theirs and you can't see what they are supposed to be building. Every round you switch team mates until you have played with everyone twice. Great components!

This is actually an okay game. I thought it wouldn't be much, but there are some fun brain-burning puzzles as you work with different partners to solve the Tetris-style puzzle in the middle. The communication picks up on the harder cards, and there are some tricky combinations to navigate.

The game, by its nature, is a bit fiddly, and there is a difficulty swing on some cards. Also a bit of downtime for non-active players.

Still, this is one that's likely fun to bring out the odd time.

A double-sided [url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/16986/ubongo]Ubongo[/url] where your temporary partner hopes that you'll die so that they can get a competent replacement. I like it, except when I'm on the less competent side of the table.

The partner-rotation system is cleverly arranged so that every player eventually partners up with every other player.  A gamer's equivalent of a key party, in other words.

A fun social activity, but it is a game... The playing is far more important than the scoring though... It's quick and cerebral, but has little in the way of tactics or strategy... You just need to play it and have fun...

This is exactly what I expected:  The spatial relations gameshow!  In this game for 3–6 players, pair off with your opponents to collaborate in building a structure from your different perspectives, as fast as you can.  The simple, but clever scoring mechanism rewards the fastest player who can also communicate well.

Oh yeah, because I can't seem to get it through my thick skull: [size=10][b]This is not a 2-player game[/b][/size]; players pair up during the game, but it is 3–6. I don't know why this is so hard to remember. :shake:

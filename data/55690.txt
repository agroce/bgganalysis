Production values are through the roof. Every single piece of art is gorgeous (albiet sometimes also grotesque, which is not a bad thing).
The game itself is no slouch either. Incredibly detailed, with deep strategy in all phases. Can feel a bit too random, and thus punishing at times though, but will likely mitigate over the entire campaign. A one-of-a-kind game.

There are quite a few cool systems in place in this game but I have two major issues with it.

First, spending multiple hours developing a character feels great! Climbing out of the dirt, dusting yourself off, and putting in the effort so that you finally begin to feel effective and cool in combat is awesome. Overcome the odds, become a hero, and feel badass, right!? It would be if it wasn't based on blind luck in the form of dice rolls. Then, once you manage to get lucky and start feeling that sense of accomplishment and satisfaction the game rips it away from you. Building up a character only to have him instantly killed by a settlement event against which I had no recourse is one of the most frustrating and unfun things to ever happen to me in a board game. I choose the phrasing "happen to me" in my previous sentence very deliberately. The player doesn't make things happen in KD:M, things happen TO the player.

I understand that the characters are not the central focus of the game, the settlement and the narrative is. If my character had died in combat after bad rolls or poor decision making then I could shrug and move on, try and do better next time. Feeling as though I didn't even participate in my character's death is difficult to overlook, especially when 75% of the game is spent micromanaging your character in combat. You even get a bonus at the start of the game for naming them! They should matter more than they do. Maybe this part of my response to the game can be boiled down to "the game is not for me" or "I, personally, don't have fun with this game" but that's the point of a review.

Second, the whole experience feels more like I'm reading a disjointed novel in the form of cards and narrative blocks from the rule book than I am playing a game. There isn't any player agency outside occasionally choosing one of two options in a narrative which is, ultimately, decided by the group. As an individual, there are no meaningful, tactical choices. I feel like a kid reading Goosebumps again. In fact, that's the best way I can think of to describe this game. You are presented with limited options and told to read what happens. Then, occasionally, you die without any opportunity to respond. Who am I kidding? You have more agency with Goosebumps. At least you choose the path that kills you.

It's a game that asks the player to hop in a cable car and enjoy some gorgeous scenery. Except the entire ride an angry drug addict is repeatedly punching you in the kidneys. Playing through the first time I felt like I'd enjoy it more once I knew what I was doing. Playing it again I felt like I should have enjoyed it more the first time, when it wasn't repetitive. Ultimately, while KD:M has clever moments, I find it to be an overengineered exercise in excess and hedonism that, problematically, relies on arbitrary randomness to create drama rather than offering the player interesting decisions.

RATING: 8
I have to say KD: Monster absolutely ridiculous when you consider its size, and the experience as a whole. It is a mixed bag of things from both ends of the spectrum, though. 

First off, the manual labour required in assembling the minis before you can even play the game is really taxing and it can take several days. You also need to get creative how to keep the components organised in order to achieve tolerable setup times. Moreover, there is no way around the fact that the core mechanics are built on random events and dice rolls with constant threat of sudden death. All these are things that have traditionally been associated with bad game design. To add to the mix, the game is a bit heavy on the bookkeeping side. The amount of information on the board quickly explodes and it is very probable that you will forget to add a modifier to a die roll or you will forget to deduct your armour value at some point. After a while it actually becomes quite possible that you accidentally miss a turn completely after forgetting whose turn it was because you just spent several minutes reading the story book.

But do the bads break the game? Assembling the minis means that KD: Monster becomes more of a hobby itself than just a game among others. It is great if you just have the time but it certainly raises the threshold of owning the game. After having successfully assembled the minis you are facing the problem of heavy setup which means that the game certainly is not for casual gaming but is better played for several hours in succession. When it comes to the old dated mechanics, I have to admit that not all mechanics of the game are archaic because the monster AI is actually ingenious. Moreover, random events and sudden deaths are ok if you can prepare yourself somehow or their impact can be mitigated. In KD you cannot always fully prepare yourself and your chances of manipulating the results of dice rolls are limited, but since all heroes inevitably either perish or retire and new heroes must rise from the settlement, you must mentally accept that death is an integral part of the game. And although your heroes gain xp and become more skilled, you cannot allow yourself to become too attached to them. Their true legacy is the equipment, culture and structures they helped to build for the other survivors coming after them. In other words, it is the settlement you are playing, not the heroes. The settlement is also the link between you and the story which, I must say, is captivating. 

Oh, and the art. I love it. It helps to bring the story to life. Many claim the that KD is filled with soft porn, and I can accept their viewpoint. However, personally I find the images mostly nightmarish and it is hard for me to be offended by the visuals. It is also has a lot to do with the cultural background you are coming from. There is no right or wrong here, but you have to accept that some people might get upset.

The bottom line is that KD: Monster is not a mechanical masterpiece or cannot be praised for its playability. But the narrative and the legacy part is the one of the best if not the best I’ve seen this far. I am also ready to let go of rules lawyering here because it just does not matter. I am playing this for the story, not for the excitement of summing up modifiers.

Probably the best board-game version of Monster Hunter, Civ, and a Rogue like I have ever played.

It is a wonderful example of "Hard but Fair" in games.  It's plenty difficult, and the philosophical statement of universal disregard for humanity is uniquely refreshing in a world where "Everyone is special."

Thank you Adam Poots for a glorious game.

Great theme, original setting, ridiculous amount of time adding and subtracting 10% bonuses/penalties on the dozen different skills/factors  characters have, most of which are triggered by random card oulls and dice rolls. You could use half as many stats and have a much more streamlined game without losing meaningful decisions.

I was planning to play solo only, but the game is so good that i force myself to organize a group...to share those epics moment

Pros:
What - A - Game... this is amazing. With only 5 years passed i'm already happy with my expensive purchase of the core box.
The atmosphere, the background, the tension, the epic story you get out of it.

Cons:
A lot of of tracking to be done, which means that you can forget things easily (this is especially true for solo play, ... still manageable so far, but just expect to forget things)

The miniatures are very impressive. I've never had so much fun in my life. My husband does all the assembling (because it is WAY too many little pieces for me) and I do all the painting. The game is very tense and keeps you on your toes. I would use the word disheartening at times... Sometimes when you're several years into the game and attached to your characters because they've lasted so long, and then the Kings Man rolls into your town and you're like... Fuck this guy... Yeah, don't do that. You lose everything. And don't get attached to your characters. Cuz it sucks when they inevitably die. 

BUT, this is still an awesome game and deserves no less than a 9 in my book :)

Very immersive and uniquely styled board game. 5 players is less enjoyable than 4, particularly with player death taking place.  It takes a bit of getting used to knowing your character is very likely to die and you'll have to start over again. Otherwise, a very fun game.  This game needs at least one person to be familiar with it or players need to be patient and become familair with it to experience it to the fullest.

RATING: 10
One of the most exciting and challenging games I've ever played.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great things about the game: beautiful components, clear Berserk manga inspiration art style and dynamic enemies that feel like they are "thinking", which adds tons of replay value. The gear grid system and synergy squares really work well for the game. The feeling of helplessness like you're trapped in a bizarre post-Eclipse world of Berserk, building a settlement out of the weird alien landscape and monsters. Essentially, Monster Hunter meets Berserk.

The bad: This game either wasn't playtested enough or the designers just don't give a shit about math. I can tell when someone tried to make the math of their game work despite not being very good at it and when they just slapped whatever together and hoped it would work as long as things had numbers relative to each other. KD:M is a clear example of the latter as none of the probabilities seem to have been worked out ahead of time to ensure the difficulty was as-intended. Most things in this game have you rolling on a table (a bit outdated but okay, I can work with this). However, several tables are simply broken, skipping numbers like this:
1-3
4-6
8-9
10
Where is 7? This happens repeatedly since the designers want to have no more than 4 table rows on most of them and shoe-horn 10 by itself most of the time. The dice you roll are inconsistent. Sometimes it's 1d10, sometimes 2d10 additive, sometimes d%(aka d100) and sometimes d5?? Not only is this jarring but rarely do they have you "check" any of your skills. These rolls are just totally out-of-your-control randomness. I get that maybe they were going for a "the universe is uncaring" feel but the rest of the game brings that oppressively, so I'm not sure why you'd have players rolling on broken inconsistent tables which are independent of player stats. On top of this, half the time you roll on a table just to roll on another table, which usually means the only "good" outcome is roll a 10 to roll a 10 on another table, which is a 1/100 chance. Same for the worst outcomes. Meaning most of the time you end up "taking 1 damage" or "getting a -1 token" to some stat or whatever the generics are. Essentially the events in the book all feel like they're trying to grief players rather than challenge them. There are way too many random event rolls in this game. Just as an example, coming back to town where you are usually safe, there's a random event deck you draw from and then on one card you can draw there's a random table you must roll. Within that table there is ANOTHER random table you roll. You can also spend precious endeavor points (1 per player) to roll on tables, which usually have a 30% chance to screw you, 30% chance to do nothing, 30% chance to do nothing of note, and a 10% chance to do something insanely good for no reason.

Most of the moral choices in the game come down to literally "save baby or eat baby" style that modern video games bring. I could go on and on about how bad the math is and how "sacky" the game feels with the monster traps and imperviousness. It seems the designers thought the only way monsters could live after a single upgrade session from players is to make them nullify half the players' attacks that actually hit; the other half always missing due to having a to-hit system followed by ANOTHER to-hit system a la Warhammer 40k. But this isn't a wargame and we aren't rolling buckets of dice. You're lucky to roll 3 attack dice early game for instance. Do the math:
At +1 accuracy and a target 7 weapon, you roll at a target 6. Of 2 dice, 1 will make it (50% chance each die). Of that 1 die, you now roll your +1 strength against a monster's 9 toughness, with a weapon strength of 2. Adding Str + weapon = 3, so you get +3 to your roll which averages at 6, so 9. Just barely a hit. So in other words, you have to do exactly the average on two different rolls which are subsets of each other. That means you need 4 dice to hit once. If one of those hit locations is First Strike, Impervious or a Trap, you're likely screwed. Don't get me wrong. I love the difficulty in the game as it provides a tactical challenge. But it relies way too much on griefing players who actually succeeded against all odds to make any difference.

On top of this, rolling a natural 10 and critting some areas requires then rolling another nat 10 to make the monster instantly die? So that's the probability that:
-The player hit with at least one die
-Then drew that hit location card out of 30 others
-Then rolled a nat 10
-Then rolled another nat 10
Why even have this effect when this is the least likely thing to happen ever? You're talking about 1/2 * 1/30 * 1/10 * 1/10 = 1/6000! You'd have to fight that thing 6000 times for it to happen, give or take since Hit Location decks increase the chances of seeing it as you go through but traps decrease the chances.

Overall, FIX YOUR FUCKING MATH and you'll become an easy 10/10 game. Oh and fix the slew of ugly typos in the rulebook. What the hell? That rant having been said, it's an intriguing game and while not really worth my money, you should at least play with a friend if they offer.

RATING: 6
It's a beautifully (over)produced game with a weird, dark fantasy aesthetic with anime influences. The miniatures are gorgeous and the components are awesome. That said, for all that expensive bling, you are basically getting a set of scripted dice-chucking adventures that simulate an RPG campaign without a DM. This game does better than many similar games do at achieving this end, but only by virtue of producing such a massive amount of material. In the end, you're still just rolling dice randomly to see what happens next.

While I am enjoying the core campaign, it's anything but elegant. There are so many things to keep track of that it gets dull with constant interruptions and forgetting about that one exception because of a fighting art you picked up but never use. The difficulty curve is infuriating. All that being said, it's got the depth and narrative style I look for in role playing games and that's commendable.

EDIT: Nevermind, with 13 more plays, I've changed my mind. Game is brilliant in most times. Nemesis are still frustrating, especially the ones that are a gear/innovation check.

Somewhere between D&D, Dark Souls, and Super Dungeon Explore, there is a coffin of a game box full of nightmarish creatures, a world of desolate mystery, and the humans(?) at the bottom of the food chain desperately fighting their way up.

For a game that prides itself on revealing as little as possible, the lore behind this world runs deep, and it is a testament to the creativity of the developer that so many people backed the project and now clamor not only for the core game and its expansions, but for player-created content as well. Expect this one to grow exponentially in the next few years.

This is the only kickstarter boardgame that I pledged to date. At the time of campaign I was hesitant, had many doubts, but still I backed it. The concept of the game convinced me. 

Game in dark fantasy setting inspired by Kentaro Miura Berserk with elements of Monster Hunter video game series ? It was like somebody created game just for me.

After the end of campaign the long wait come... Game release was pushed back again and again. I was really worried if my expectations and creators promises will be achieved, still after 3 years of waiting the base game arrived... 

I've opened it played it and I'm speechless. Adam the creator delivered all what he promised and much more. The game is huge, the quality of components is amazing and the gameplay ?... It's just fun, "brutally fun". Limbs are flying, characters are dying, but everybody is having great time. The game is difficult, but not in frustrating way. It encourage quick learning on previous mistakes. 

I could write more and more, about different monsters and unique AI system, about great story that unfolds while you play, but this is something that people should experience by themselves...

For me ? I found my grail game.

The models and background fluff are completely bonkers and brilliant, but the game is overcomplicated nonsense. I want to love it but the mechanics make that difficult. Many better games to buy with this crazy amount of money. If you wants a tactical RPG board game experience, Descent / Imperial Assault is mechanically loads more satisfyingly. 

Edit: to be clear, the bizarre, profane monster models are tremendous and unique, but the callipygian "pinup" models with their ludicrously pendulous breasts are just embarrassing. Let's not perpetuate the stereotype that board gamers are all teenage virgins...

Simply one of, if not the most, fun games I've played. No game is perfect, but this game DOES give me and my group a perfect playing experience. Its the most RPG I'd enjoy, and although the battle system isn't deep, the enemy AI deck is unique and awesome, and the STORY this game tells is perfect. Add in some group imagination and for the right people its a perfect experience..which in our case it is...so I give this game a 10. Quality is great, as well. 

My friend owns it, so I won't be buying it, however if they ever released a $60 dollar version with all the content, except with standees instead of miniatrues, I would buy it to introduce to others.

RATING: 6
Kingdom Death: Monster is extremely random and the game play could be tightened up. Hits during combat a determined through the rolling of d10s. As characters improves, the lower values are need for successful a hit. Monsters use a similar system of dice for combat, but, unlike the player characters employs a combat deck from which its actions are drawn. Certain character abilities allow the player characters to manipulate this action deck.

The intro and our first hunt took about four hours, while our second and third hunt took three hours. Half of our characters died during our first hunt, and the rest died of the plague. None of our characters died on the second hunt, but one died from the plague. This was frustrating because, aside from the randomness, the character who died had both randomly earned bonuses and been specifically assigned bonuses, then she randomly died. The entropy of the game decreases over time, but, nonetheless, the consequences of a bad roll are devastating--e.g., I had a critical hit on the lionesses gonads (that is not a typo) and, as a result, "she" concentrated her attacks on my character until he died.

I will continue you to play the game despite my misgivings because it is interesting.

I've been playing this game for months on end. While it's not for everyone, serious board game/miniature hobbyist combo people will love it. Be prepared for Dark Souls brutality mixed with Lovecraftian horror, all with the highest quality miniatures and accessories. The game is eminently replayable and the expansions are so... expansive (pun intended) as to offer hundreds of hours of game-time. If I could rate this an 11 our of 10 I would.

Early review: This is peak Ameritrash. The bits are fantastic. The flavour is deep and tasty. The dice chucking is abundant and randomness is everywhere. Playing it is a bit of a physical ordeal due to the sheer amount of stuff, but it well and truly creates an experience. Can't give it 10, just because it is so very inelegant.

It's dark, it's tough, it's fiddly, it's deep, it's depressing and it's amazing. It puts you under pressure right from the beginning and doesn't let go. I love Darkest Dungeon on PC and this is basically it in a board game form. Bad stuff just keeps happening to you and you have to struggle against the odds. Just don't get too attached to your people. The feeling when you accomplish something is worth it. Settlement phase is a bit fiddly, with lots of bookkeeping but it gets the job done. Definitely not a game for everyone. Also, ridiculously expensive.

Yes… and no. As a miniature player myself, (40k, Warmachine) the price is ok. KDM has some of the best miniature in the market. Exquisite detail. Beautiful characters. This is top notch stuff right there. The quality of this game, from the big box to the minis, the book and cards, worth every penny that you’ll spent on it. And getting this game at half price thanks to the kickstarter is even sweeter.

As for the general gameplay, I have to say no. In all honesty, the game is fun. Very fun. You will have some good time with your friends, or solo, trying to survive in the world of KDM. The thing is, unless you are a fan of randomness, the game might turn you off. Especially for the price the game (between 300$ to 2000$ with expansion). You see, the game system of KDM is secondary compare to the content. For me, the random aspect of this game is what I find a bit frustrating. Every decision that you make is met with a dice rolling or a card drawing with very little way to mitigate the luck aspect. The game system is all about luck and nothing else. You can lose your best survivor with one single bad roll. In or out of combat. Some will love it. Some will not.  I don’t mind dice rolling system. I mean I’ve play RPG and 40k for many years now. But I rather lose my survivor because I made a bad decision than losing it because the card I draw randomly tell me to do so. The rules were clearly made for the content and not the other way around. It’s not a bad thing. But If you buy this game at full price and expect the best gaming experience ever with the best rules system, I don’t think you will find it here. Not for 400$! Even 250$ Especially when you can get a game like Gloomhaven for 99$. But as I said before, if you are a fan try your luck game, this game is for you.

The settlement part of the game is awesome. Yes, the randomness is still there but with less impact than the hunting part and the showdown part. This part is where the game shine for me. As the game advance, you can gain innovations, create weapons and armor, have babies and choose principles for your settlement. The replay value of KDM is insane. So much stuff to do. This game is…EPIC!

Uptated: This game is too good. Addictive AF!!! 9.5 out of ten

Does this count towards 1.5?

My 1.5 arrived, I enjoy putting together the minis, like when I was 12 and would put together model aeroplanes, same feel. plus its got some great components for an interesting game. Sure its not for everyone and I'll likely make up a homebrew for my kids (cavemen & mammoths) but the survival theme seems to be a new one for board games (minecraft was the one for PC)

Score may adjust as the newness wears off and I get more into the nitty gritty of a multi-year campaign, but for now HOLY CRAP!  I had high expectations for this game out the gate, and while waiting almost 3 years for it to arrive may have been almost as brutal as the showdown phase, it has met all of them.  Poots and his team have put out a fantastically refined boutique game and while I wish it was a bit more accessible to all gamers (mainly due to price but also limited run from a small production house) I don't think the game would be as good as it is had Adam cut any corners.  It is tight and polished and packs 18lbs of ultra high quality minis, cards, boards, dice, etc into a massive black box of death.  If this game is within your budget, I HIGHLY recommend grabbing a copy if and when it goes back on sale in the Kingdom Death webstore.

Only player the white lion 6 times so far (spend some 20+ hours playing & assemling), but I have had such a blast with this game that it skyrockeded past mage knight and became my all time favourite board game! 

I always want to play more and time is never enough. This is a must buy for everyone who think they would like this type of game! I bought it on a chance and I have never regretted my decision :D

This game is epic is scope and box size.  It is literally the reason so many of my other games are collecting dust.  Never have I enjoyed a board game so much that I would set it up for an entire weekend and play every chance that I got.  I quit logging plays for this because there were simply too many.  

Update Oct 1,2016
This game continues to be in regular rotation and has not lost it's allure.  I've purchased a number of the expansions which have certainly added some interesting elements, but the base set alone remains intriguing.  The challenge has not been lost. Was it expensive, yes, was it worth it most certainly, would I ever sell my copy?  You must be out of your mind :)

Was feeling a bit of buyer’s remorse (Satan’s pledge+) but now that I have the game and am playing it I am confident I made a good decision going all-in. I was worried the handling time would have me prefer the Tabletop Simulator version and though the game is a bit slower, it feels so much more grand and exciting and impressive in person. Best game I own and that is just playing it solo thus far (and I am hardly a solo fan).

This game almost replaces the need for a game group at all :)

RATING: 7
This game is work to play, but fun. I did enjoy the time playing the game but in the end it was not for me. I rate a 7 because there is a huge random element to the game, on par with Talisman or Relic. I am okay with randomness in games that last only a hour or two. This game has a cool campaign system that last for weeks, and with he randomness it can start to drain your enthusiasm. The background of the game is also great and there is a deep story to be told to the game and characters, but again not for me. I enjoy stories that are made up in games but I feel a normal RPG would serve me the same purpose. There is more depth that can be created in a RPG then this game. I rarely play RPGs anymore hence why this aspect of KDM falls flat for me. I also am typing a big-ish review like this because I had some PM me asking why I gave the game a 7, and was not happy with my answer. In the end I doubt I would play it enough to warrant keeping and sold it away. Again fun but work...

One of my favorite games, for various reasons.  All 20 lbs. of it.

Is it the "best" game?  Tightest game?  Most balanced game? 

No to all.

But it is still one of my favorites.  Like playing Demon Souls with cardboard.  

Doesn't hurt that my wife bought me this for Valentine's Day 2016, as a surprise.

Played it, sold it.  Was just holding onto it for sentimental reasons.  Got enough for it to take my wife and me on a 4-day cruise.  I'll take it.

Kingdom Death: Monster has arrived and we're really enjoying it. My girlfriend and I have been playing it off and on for about 10 "lantern years" so far. The gameplay is as brutal as promised, but perseverance has kept us going. The game is still new and shiny, but we're enjoying all of the phases. The Showdown is the bulk of the fighting and encounter with the monsters that you're hunting (or that might be hunting you). The Hunt adds some unpredictability before most showdowns (potentially devastating, potentially rewarding). The Settlement phase adds building and crafting and keeps you coming back for more.

We'll come back to this when we've got a few campaigns under our belt, but so far this has been very enjoyable and well worth the investment. Can't wait to see some of the expansions.

Ok I'm back with updates after having completed 3-5 campaigns and started a total of at least 10 individual campaigns with different groups and friends. With the release of the expansions we're taking our time introducing new parts of the game so as not to burn through content too quickly, so we've only actually played with Gorm and the People of the Stars campaign (Dragon King Expansion).

This game is still probably our favorite and it has been in the dining room and on the dining room table since last Fall. After 8-9 core campaigns we did start to run into some fatigue due to the repetitive hunting nature of the White Lion (your starting quarry). Granted we're in the multiple hundreds of lantern years now, though, and we have fun either optimizing our gear and attacks for maximum profit in some settlements or risking it all and hunting challenging and dangerous quarries in others.

When we think back on this investment, we consider the amount of time we get out of a typical game. With hundreds of games in our collection, we have some games that get multiple replays (classics like Puerto Rico and Catan; current favorites like Thurn & Taxis and Seven Wonders, etc). Those games get about 20-30 hours a year each with my family at a minimum. Kingdom Death has given us hundreds of hours of enjoyable play time. And when we eventually get bored I know that this will be a fun game to come back to a few years later to re-experience.

I had bought three previous kickstarter games. Two were good and one was awful. I like hard games that are different that require thinking and strategy. 

This game has met my expectations. I have spent ~30 hours playing so far. I have spent 15 hours building and painting (and I'm am amateur at both). 

To me it's well worth the money. A Switch or this? I well spend many more hours on Kingdom death. I look forward to those hours,

RATING: 10
There are countless reviews expressing how amazing this game is so I'll just touch on the things I personally like. It gives you endless choices. The story is deep, dark, and compelling. Every monster showdown (and there are a TON of them) feels completely different. The White Lion fight feels nothing like the Screaming Antelope fight, which feels totally different from the Butcher's fight, and so forth. There is a lot of randomness, yes, but the intention is to improve your characters, gear, and settlement as a whole to mitigate the randomness. The potential to die suddenly and instantly makes you consider your actions early on.

Component-wise, there is no peer. Kingdom Death is a class of its own. The miniature quality and detail is astounding. The card quality is top notch. The insert is fantastic. The tokens are great. The dice are great. The settlement cards are great. The gear cards are an amazing and interesting way to equip your survivors and... yep, the quality is great.

Even the box is great. The black print looks like suede. The cardboard is super thick and resilient.

This game cannot be compared.

Game does not reflect price, but because the price it askew the way to you look at the game.

Has some great ideas, great game, great figures (more for hobbyist perspective, quite challenging for board gamers with no experience in this area).
Rules are not too clear on things. Done in a way to hide much from player for spoilers purposes but all it does is hide much from player to limit understanding of rules. We spend an hour trying to figure out why Berserker made you suffer Bash (in effect you use Berserk and fall over,???)  Only to find Bash, and Knock Down, is the same only different is wording because something else protects verse bash but not KD so they have different terms for same thing... it is just not needed. Still no real understanding why you fall down using the skill. OR Insane... do not ask how you become sane/insane it is like you have a switch that flicks back and forth... really no clear understanding lies in the system just rules to what you do... There will be many clashes which you will thumb book trying to work out.

Expensive... not just the core game, but ALL of it. There is no expansions in shops anymore, so you have to get via Ebay. You never know the quality of mini, if put together correctly, or damamged, but you will know you're paying way more then they did. Even if it was not Ebay and you picked it up during one the "sales" on KS then you're still ooking at thousands for the complete game. WAY overpriced.

Awesome game, but not for the asking price, "amazing" game, the depth and level of commitment feels a lot like it is because of the cost makes the game feel better then it is.

When evaluated purely for mechanics 6/10. The "game" is a randomly generated obstacle course. With meta-knowledge winning is a trivial task.
I rate a 9.5 as a puzzle or toy. Playing with it and running through campaigns is amazingly fun. Fights are cut throat and the aesthetics are hauntingly beautiful. A must buy if you're into miniature hobby. All components are top notch. It would not be on my shelf if it weren't for the miniatures, art and story telling.

One play so far so I have a lot to go- likely this rating will fluctuate as well.
Yep, it has dice. I normally would hate the swinginess, but what KDM does so awesomely is because you expect to die and expect to suck, you're not disappointed when you get hammered and die. It's really only lucky rolls that feel unwarranted- everything unlucky you don't feel too disappointed. Granted this is only after 1.5 plays, but so far, so great.

1/25/2018: 3 plays in. Bumping to 8.5. Somehow the dice don't bother me as much as I thought they would- maybe because I haven't been ridiculously burned by them yet. Very fun game.

2/11: Bumping to a 9

Campaign and settlement development live up to hype. Rulbook is one of the best. Table of contents, index, referenced sections. Brutal. Sexual. Unforgiving. The designer is unapologetic in his world and vision and I appreciate that.  By now most of the community knows this is fully an adult game.

Gameplay is heavily ruled by dice luck and dice mitigation. Not your thing? Move along. Survivors will die gruesomely. Not your thing? Move along. grotesque horror not your thing? Move along. Definition of niche game, but it lives up to the hype.

This really is something unique. I think I did a pretty good job at not letting all of the hype put me in a state of seeing Kingdom Death through an overly optimistic eye during the wait before receiving my copy of the core game -although, I probably never would have gone for it in the first place due to it's price point if it weren't for all of the buzz and the overall features being promised in the game. During that period, I even purposefully avoided looking into the rules very much so that it would be a fresh experience, and something that I'd get to discover in person and with my own reason. And I've got to say, WOW, this really is something unique!

The Models:
 +Made of excellent material and with an excellent process, as far as I can tell.
 +The fixed pose figures (the monsters, starting survivors, intimacy survivors, and young and old survivors) have excellent sculpts.
 -The remaining parts for making custom survivors are not as impressive. Due to their customizable nature, the poses and glue seams won't look as nice - like their shoulders and necks  kind of remind me of GI Joes or Barbies. Unless...
 -Paint. They will look better if you spend the time to fill seams and paint them. As somebody who is presently unwilling to attempt the daunting task, I see this as a negative - the customizable figures don't look as good if you don't paint them...
 +Assembling the models wasn't something I was looking forward to, honestly, but after I got into it, I just kept going! For like two days!
 -Are what make Kingdom Death so expensive. Like I said, I've enjoyed putting them together, to my surprise, but I personally would like the gameplay and experience just as much even if the figures were replaced with nicely illustrated tokens. Assembling (and painting, if you like) the figures kind of seems like it's own thing in itself - like a second hobby project that happens to come in the same box as a board game. If you've already tried it and know you don't enjoy assembling models, then sadly, I would have a hard time recommending this package to you. About 70% of what you are paying for is the plastic... Unless you know somebody that does enjoy putting together miniatures, whose skills you trust, and is willing to do it, then I'd say go for it! If you've never tried it for yourself before, and you have some spare time, then I'd also recommend giving it a shot. All you need is super glue, sprue cutters, an X-acto knife, and tweezers occasionally. Other things that will really help are patience, good closeup eyesight (or a magnifying glass), and dexterous fingers.

(I've got a lot more to say about Kingdom Death, but not the time to do it at the present. I will continue later. =])

I purchased 5 extra Kingsmen and glued them to bases in groups of two and three to match the Level 2 and 3 encounter.

"Dungeons and Dragons with Porn and Paper"

Kingdom Death: Monster the rumor in the interwebz. I heard about it late 2014 and found it pretty intruiging. But the game was nowhere available to late-back or pre-order. So I forgot about it...
...until the KS was delivered.
Then I started to deal with it. Luckily right before I was willing to trade a kidney for a used copy on eBay the second Kickstarter launched. And off we go.

I love the universe Adam Poots has designed.
It's like American Mc Gee's Alice on steriods combined with some hallucinations of some mentally ill fever patients. The kind of body horror in these minis as well as this whole darkness filled world is pretty intruiging to me.

I'm no painter or mini-display-er but I even enjoy the hobby aspect of building the minis. They are so incredibly well sculpted, there is nothing to compare them to.
The fact that you had to assemble the miniatures didn't scare me at all, I was looking forward to doing that actually. Thanks to vibrantlantern.com I did that in no time.

The cards could have used a better card stock but are still to be considered as good. I've seen way worse but for the amount of money it could have been better.

More will come when I played the game.

The first two games were pretty impressive. The showdown with the AI cards is such an incredible smart and authentic design.

The only negative I have so far is the rulebook.
Yes I like the entry where you are thrown into the action and learn everything when you need it. BUT after the Prologue is over you get several pages of rules. Not a problem as long as you read that before you play.
I relied on the "learn-as-you-go" nature of the book everybody was talking about...and then I was sitting there reading the rules out loud to the other player. Bad. This doesn't change my opinion of the game but it would have been better to know this before.

These two plays already showed the amount of bookkeeping that you have to do which can definitely mitigated by organising your play area well.

Of to the next sessions...

This is what a "survival" game should be... all about SURVIVAL.  Survival is not balanced; survival is brutal, unrelenting, savage.

Those that want a "balanced" game should look elsewhere.  This game definitely favors the monsters and rightly so.  Humans in this game's universe are at the bottom of the food chain.  The unbalanced feeling makes it all that more rewarding when your group does beat a monster.

Having owned this game for the last few weeks and getting several plays in, I can honestly say that this is my favorite game in my collection of games.  I like that this game has both a board game feel as well as a modeling aspect (like that of the Games Workshop line of games).  The great thing about this game is it's all in one self-contained package.  Unlike other table-top games, each player doesn't have to bring their own survivors.

Everyone that I have played this with (even non-gamers) loves it.  Especially the fact that the survivors have it so hard.

Probably the best (and most expensive) board game I've ever played. The options are limitless and each run through the game is fresh and changing all the time. Just beating the game with cheating at all is difficult! Top tier game guaranteed unless you do not like a challenge because this game is not forgiving.

Morbid, unforgiving, and wildly diverse.

Once things start going wrong, it's a downhill spiral from there.

After about our 6th play-though we finally beat the Butcher encounter, but lost our 4 best in the next showdown. It's a blast.

Kingdom Death: Monster...只是玩了White Lion 的一幕不敢妄下定論，在此嘗試摘錄一位一起玩的資深 RPG 大師的意見供大家參考。
1. 模型精美, 但要花很多時間砌, 完成後不易收藏又容易弄壞。·
2. 機制跟本是 RPG ,把書上的資料放於卡上。
3. 怪獸 AI 了得, 以Al卡為血。有創意和怪獸技能隻隻不同,實是有其可取之處。
4. 故事新穎, 但有點以色情成份取悦玩家, 意識不敢恭維。
5. 最後漫畫部份太粗糙，感覺大打折扣。
6. 最後價錢平真的會買。????

Society building in a nightmare world. I was surprised in many ways of how deep this game goes. The fight mechanics are fast and hard and the Settlement management really gives a feeling of stoneage in a world of horrors.
Get ready for many deaths among the Characters. This game can be depressing but it shows how fragile life can be so that the beautiful moments really shine.
This game gives the troupe lots of harsh outcomes to stomach so dont play if you can't handle pain!
High praise to the awsome miniature design! I love the hobby aspect of it.

A hardcore, roguelike survival settlement simulator with tactical combat. Extremely flavorful, and always produces a great narrative. It's about the journey with this game, not the end. Similar to roguelike PC games your enjoyment mileage will vary depending on how much you like random events and rng. Tons of expandability as well. Little overpriced IMO even though the miniatures are very nice, but I'm certainly going to get my money's worth.

tl;dr While this game is easily not for most people, it is most assuredly for me.

Kickstarter Impressions: 

Back at the end of 2012 I was completely in love with the look and idea of this game. Probably too much so. I was on the page every day refreshing and re-reading updates. I was hooked. After the close-out, it became a running joke in the household that this was the "greatest game never made". It was punishable to even mention the name and friends would often poke fun at me by doing so. It was a long three years and my hope was often tested.

Initial Impressions: 

After I healed from my snapped back carrying it inside, I carefully opened Kingdom Death: Monster for the first time. I delicately removed and prepared all components, marveling at the beautiful state of the thick and colorful tokens. I stroked the lovingly textured cards for seemingly hours. I rose an eyebrow and held in a sigh of disdain at the paltry hunt/settlement board. Then I poured over the gorgeous sprues, absolutely overwhelmed at the beauty, amount and complexity.

Components:

Models - Wow. Those sprues were complex. I will add that the Base Set Sprue (White Lion, 4 survivors) was super simple to put together and I would venture to guess it would be manageable for everyone. Everything else though was an adventure. While the models were gorgeous once complete, the sprues were often unintuitive and gaps were common place, especially with the monsters. I was surprised at the amount of mold lines (they are a model company first, after all), but I've seen worse. Painting them has been a dream and I love glancing over to my shelf when I'm not playing.

Tokens and Boards - The game board is big and beautiful. The tokens are simple enough to recognize at a glance but are still very artistic. The settlement/hunt board and the player boards are a disgrace and being the only poorly done component, is an odd eye-sore. While, functional, I'm looking for gorgeous in my high-end games, even if that means a higher price.

Cards - Beautiful! Perfect! I've never felt better cards. I was very impressed. Every impulse is to sleeve them to protect them, but I can't bring myself to not have my hands on them during play. The art is astounding.

Odds and ends - The box is nice and robust, and the insert is very useful (even to the point I haven't fully utilized it yet). The dice are good and the rulebook is a large paper book that works, but I feel with the size would have been perfect with a hardcover release. Maybe in the future.

Da rulez:

Really well done, especially with the amount of variability. I feel that, while the introductory hunt rules are done very well and was useful to learn the game, they made it difficult for more advance players to look up rules. Some rules were not placed again in the more conclusive portions later in the book, so you have to remember which of the two areas talks about specific rules, instead of just referring to the Showdown sections for all things pertaining to Showdown. The game can be easily learned, played and taught with only the rulebook.

Gameplay:

This game almost feels like three games that blur together at the lines that separate them. To properly review Kingdom Death: Monster, I'm going to review each of its three phases separately and finally how they work together.

Showdown Phase - Interesting. Initially, the choices and tactical capabilities appear very limited. However, after a few hunts and some work in the other phases, option open up and boy, do they open up. This game ends up having huge depth in choice and customization. Between gear and various abilities, it is rare to have survivors play the same as one another after a few "Lantern Years". 

In the beginning, the Showdown phase appears very dependent on luck. Between almost everything requiring two, consecutive successful die rolls to get anything accomplished and the potential for random cards to disrupt even really lucky rolls, you feel very much at the mercy of the monster. This helps with the feeling of hopelessness, but if players can't get passed the face value of this, it can be very frustrating. With equipment, abilities and smart plays, this is heavily mitigated, while never disappearing completely.

The monsters feel intelligent and deadly. Especially in the beginning, you have the constant sense that you're at the bottom of the food chain and you'll do anything to eek out your miserable existence. That feeling continues throughout the many sessions, but you begin to learn the monster's habits and how to exploit their weaknesses. You rarely feel more powerful than them, but with practice and a little luck, will feel more intelligent.

Settlement Phase - Arguably the most interesting of the three phases, this is where the game truly shines. This is where you gain the understanding that its not the survivors individually that matter, but the survivors as a group, embodied by the Settlement. Survivors will die. The only constant, is your Settlement. Innovations are engaging and really effect future choices every time. Creating gear almost feels like a treasure hunt every time, every piece opening new tactical options. 

This phase also turns out to be the most dangerous. Nearly every encounter or action has the chance (sometimes high chance) of killing one or more survivors. Every choice made in this phase makes or breaks your settlement more so than any other phase.

Hunt Phase - While, the least impactful of the phases, it is important to the synergy of the overall game and helps the theme shine through. The Hunt sometimes presents difficult and dangerous decisions and puts the skills of the survivors to the test. The monster can and will outsmart you from time to time and other times, you'll out maneuver it. The hunt phase gives life to the world of Kingdom Death outside of the settlement and beyond the monsters themselves.

All together now - Each phase is interesting on it own merits, but the way the work together is nearly seamless. The theme bleeds from this game. Every phase works together to deliver you a customized experience. While I have my favorites, I can't imagine this game being as fun as it is without all three.

Bottom Line:

If you do not buy into the theme, this game is not for you. Kingdom Death: Monster creates a tactical and strategically satisfying, long-term session-based game all wrapped up in a dark, vicious theme. This is your personal story of the weakness of man and the strength of will. Please, experience this unique adventure yourself.

This is my first 10 rating on BGG for a game. It is a solo experience at this point 5 lantern years in. It is very challenging with lots to keep track of, especially solo. But it has an amazing atmosphere and the game has such depth. It is possible I may tire of it someday and downgrade my rating, but I absolutely love the emergent storytelling that happens and the variety of combat from wonderfully designed AI. It can be very random, but coming from RPGs I think that is fine and adds suspense to the game. It's great if you don't mind dice rolling.

I am still in my 3rd or 4th campaign, and have not yet managed to complete one, so this is a tentative rating. 

KDM is a tremendous game, and a feat of artistic vision. It has the best emerging narrative arc I have witnessed in any game, which is surprisingly not due to written word, but to its mechanisms, aesthetics and general atmosphere. At its core, it is a light RPG (but with the great innovation that you control a settlement, not one hero!), paired with a tech-up grind fest and a skirmish subgame. As pedestrian and old-fashioned these ingredients might seem, the end result is however phenomenal. 

KDM is one of this rare breed of games where after onboarding the rules and intricacies, the mechanisms disappear and take second row to the overall experience. There are one-roll perma-deaths, unmitigated disasters of all sorts, and the odd bit of unbelievable luck, as well as a weak "hunt phase" subsystem (which I view as random input variability), but none of these bother me. The key is that the KDM world is an inexplicable alternate reality of a nightmare, and anything can (and perhaps should) happen. The skirmish subgame is, however, excellent. Intricate, super tactical and very exciting. I also enjoy the gear exploration and combo making, and this will likely last very long given the large gear selection and rarity. And to this point, KDM has another great feature I enjoy: Rarity. Like Magic Realm or Mage Knight, seeing all special cards, artifacts, assets etc will take you a very long time. Rarity breeds quality.

I was never a miniature collector or painter, but I have been happily assembling all my minis as needed, and have even started painting them. It is a relaxing side dish of the hobby, and one that emotionally binds. So it's true, the little figures after a while gain a bit of life of their own. And guess what, mine are painted unlike any other KDM minis in the world, take that "legacy" games!

I cannot find any big flaw in KDM, except perhaps to suggest that an app settlement management system, instead of the paper and pencil one, is sorely needed, to streamline the uninteresting part of constantly updating the survivors sheets.

This ought to be in the top 10 boardgames of all time. Experience it, if you can.

What can I say...  One of the first things I backed on KS and as the years of waiting rolled by and more and more games flooded the market, many of which came from KS and were bad, I began to lose hope that this expensive, overly ambitious project would bear fruit.  Boy was I wrong.  After 3 years of waiting, it sure was worth it.  The epic scope of this game, the art, the story, the theme and flavor, and best of all, the GAMEPLAY is all fantastic.  The production was immense and the quality is fantastic.  This is not just a game but a work of pure art and a MAGNUM OPUS of a game from visionary designer Adam Poots and team.

More random then snakes and ladders. Theme and story is 11/10 , the rest is rolling dice.

If you like...

-Roguelike video games (Darkest Dungeon, FTL, Dungeon of the Endless, etc.)
-D&D style RPG CO-UP adventure (Decent, Mice & Mystic, etc.)
-Challenging Boss fights (kinda like Eldritch Horror Mythos deck; you will never have the exact same fight)
-Character building and gear collecting (MMORPG, Monster Hunter, etc.)
-Solo story telling games (Mage Knight the board game)
-Dark, mystical, grim, despair stories with strange monsters (ex: Shin Megami Tensei)
-Miniature building background (Warhammer, Warmachine, etc.)
-Heavy games which will last at least 1~2 hours per section and requires 20+ sections to complete
-One base game (you ONLY need the black box) you can own and play many many hours

You will love KD:M.


However, if you prefer ...
-Pure dice rolling combat games (in KD:M, bad positioning can wipe the party)
-Easy going games (you can't play KD with booze ... you won't survive)
-Heavy mechanic games (this is no Euro game where everything can be planned/predicted)
-Balancing games (please tell From Software to balance Dark Soul)
-Continues games without interrupting (need to refer to rulebook all the time for events/tables)
-fast or one-off games (but after you finish the prologue, you will want more ... you will)
-pre-made Miniatures (you need to build at least 4 little minis + monsters or use proxy models from other games)
-Light weight games (you need pencils and eraser and A LOT of bookkeeping)
-Affordable games (ya ... biggest drawback. The game can be a bit cheaper if you can find ways to sell your minis)

KD:M might not be for you.

I once saw this game described as the closest thing to a video game you'll get on a table, and it's 100% true--in the best way. A game like no other, D&D meets Above and Below, and all grotesque nightmare horror. The monster AI system is elegant and brilliant, and each decision feels impactful and rooted in theme. Although it has some murky rules and frustrating rulebook layout, the experience of the game is like none other I've ever played.

RATING: 10
Kingdom Death: Monster isn't a game for everyone. The game is extremely expensive, requires a large amount of time to assemble, and the book keeping seem overwhelming even in the budding stages of the campaign. Stack that on top of a game that is designed to be unfair towards the player and it rules out a large part of the gaming community. 

That being said, for those who it is catering to, it does an amazing job. The price point of the game is appropriate when you consider the care that has gone in to providing the player with extremely high quality miniatures, beautifully illustrated full-color game cards and book, and a box that is so big and dark that it will be ominous regardless of where you choose to hide it.

Assembly of the miniatures is a hassle, but they are some of the nicest miniatures this reviewer has seen in any tabletop environment. Period. They are slightly behind Games Workshop in their plastic quality, but every new plastic release closes the game a little more. The variation allowed by the different sprues allows players to build a custom hero to fit their tastes and play style. 

Like any tabletop RPG, the game has a steep learning curve and a huge amount of book keeping. In my first few game sessions, it all seemed overwhelming. There's a lot to take in to account! However, the game smooths out and becomes much more fluid as you continue to play. Every group develops different ways to manage the books, keep track of survivors, and record the happenings in their little settlement. The community also offers many alternatives to the traditional pen and paper style.

Kingdom Death is a game that won't appeal to all, but should definitely be appreciated for the game mechanics and themes that it utilizes all too effectively. If you can't find a good reason to purchase it, I'd recommend finding a local player and giving it a try. Cheers!

Very cool and very, very random as well. I knew it would be random, but wasn't really prepared for the level of it. I hope there are ways to mitigate this somewhat further into the game. Anf this from someone who normally loves a bit of randomness.

The models are nice but a pain to assemble for an amateur like me. I'm getting better, but could probably have lived with somewhat less advanced models that were easier to assemble.

After the first settlement phase and having read some guides on-line I'm more comfortable with the game. Very disturbing world, but I like it so far.

Great solo game and well worth the purchase price. I can't wait to grab those expansions. With those, this will be my go-to solo game for YEARS. I've even enjoyed putting together the minis so far and making custom survivors is a whole new world of addiction. Just a great experience overall.

So much better than even I was expecting.  The combat rules are deep and so fun, but yet easy to pick up and play.   So much variety and so many different dynamics going on in every fight.   Stunning.

The miniatures are the industries finest.   The quality control and the artistry are simply hard to believe.  This game costs alot of money.........  Please please, someone continue to make games that leave me begging to give you more money.   

Long Live the King

focusing too much on useless miniature that have juvenile design. no information on gameplay beyond the 2 simplistic videos. had to think this might be a bust in preorder because of the designer zero experience of gamplay. if this thing failed, the best thing would be selling the useless miniatures on eBay for any price to recoup the preorder. and the fanbois in the forum is juvenile and fanatical.

I'm of two minds of this game. On the one hand, the settlement phase of the game is nearly perfect. Exactly the type of trapping I like to see for a grind style game. Building up your town, people, and technology is incredibly satisfying and compelling. 

On the other hand. I hate the combat, it feels very style over substance. There's a lot of really fun event styled things happening, but it always feels too punishingly random for such a large part of the game.

There may be ways to mitigate it and come out ahead, but the combat and hunt phases of the game bored me to tears. I've heard that Gloomhaven has elements of the settlement phase in it, and the combat in that looks far superior, so hopefully that'll give me the experience I was looking for here (when I can finally get ahold of a copy)

The rules are easy, the combat system is great, and the single player mode is fantastic for us antisocial folks.

RATING: 9
I payed so much money this has to be a 10.


On a serious note: after five plays I am starting to get the hang of it. Though I can relate to people calling the game fiddly. You will have to look up rules and keywords quite often. If the dice and cards don't like you the game can quickly shift into a downward spiral.

What KD:M reminds me most of is the original UFO Enemy Unknown of 1994. From the structure of the game to the attachment that you can develop for certain survivors. The game also has a resource management aspect when you are trying to hunt for the resources you need to craft the items you want.

Overall, be prepared to take loads of punishment from the game. But when things go your way it feels all the more rewarding. Even if it was just the roll of the dice.

Who am I kidding? It's downright perfect. Anything less than a ten is just dishonest. The components are out of this world. The minis are probably the best plastics in the business. The complete gameplay package is so engrossing, and so much fun for either a solo run or a group of four. Obviously you have to enjoy minis in order to justify the purchase, but make no mistake, this is one of the greatest games ever produced. Ever.

The game is not for everyone, but for me it scratches all the itches of resource management, storytelling, hobby and wargames.  People call it the "holy grail" game for a reason.  Even better that it has artwork and graphic design to die for.  If you like brutally difficult games that are rewarding in not just in game "buffs" but with stories you get to tell about your strife you will not be disappointed.

Kickstarter 1.5 - Black Friday Gambler's Lantern 2nd Face
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
There is a phrase in role playing gaming that sums up this game perfectly: "rocks fall, everyone dies". This refers to situations where there is no choice or action, merely everyone being killed off due to either luck or an angry DM. Most games try to limit this, but this game makes it the main element. Roll a dice, and there is a 75% chance one or more characters will die. 

The components, text, and setting of this game are extremely high quality. The creators did a tremendous job polishing the game, and the depth of the setting shines through. 

What they did not do was provide any kind of balance, any meaningful choices, or any way to mitigate bad luck. Crafting and experience both require your characters surviving. They won't. 

I played a game of this, and our group did four hunts. In three of those, all party members died. In the only hunt we won, only one party member survived. All hunts were against the easiest monster. Even with observing its tactics, our group still was unable to beat it more than once out of four hunts. 

The encounters are randomly chosen, and have beautiful flavor text that really draws out the setting, but the result of the vast majority of these encounters is one or more characters is killed, with no chance to change the outcome and zero player input. For example: one event happened where a roll of the dice decided that one of my characters and one of another player's characters killed each other. No choices, no input, no meaningful interaction, it was simply: someone rolled a 63, two characters died. 

Most of the combats work the same way: the monster attacks, and most likely kills a character. Then characters attack, and either miss and get killed by a counter-attack, or hit, fail to wound, and get killed, or hit, wound, and then get killed. Roll poorly once? That character is dead. This game offers all the excitement of playing a group of unarmed peasants being killed by a dragon. 

The odds are always stacked against anyone in the party surviving, and there is very little that anyone can do to change those odds. Your characters and your party will only last as long as everyone rolls improbably well. The only way to survive is to roll well, every time, because this game, beneath all its complex flavor, boils down to "don't roll poorly". 

While I respect the amount of effort and creativity that went into this game, I would never voluntarily play it again. I enjoy games where strategy and meaningful choices exist-this game has neither. I enjoy games where what a player decides has a meaningful effect-that is totally absent in this game. 

What this game does provide is endless variety in ways to die. For players that enjoy a good story, but don't like to take part, and for players who like to see their characters die over and over, this is the perfect game. For my part, I'll pass.

I died horribly in the fourth year. The game runs on (un)lucky dice and (un)lucky cards with minor ways of manipulation of said lucky events.

What? Yes, I do grade this a 9, because I only think about starting again to try and live longer this time around!
and probably this mark will get higher the further in this experience I'll get!
It's a ruthless game and death is around every corner... beautiful violent death, with beautiful miniatures, loads of very thematic cards and painfully detailed/illustrated descriptions of bodyparts that are ripped apart.
This feels like a piece of gruesome gory art... delicious.

I was really excited about this game with the beautiful artwork and the amazing concept that it appeared to be... until I saw the cost. I missed the Black Friday sale, and even at $200, that is a steep entry level. This is like a GamesWorkshop-esque investment (Warhammer and 40k). There are a LOT of great games out there that don't cost $1,000 to get into. It is too bad, because I really would have enjoyed giving the game a try. If the new trend in game design is income level elitism, I'm out. I'll wait and see if it ever goes broader than the few that can afford it. If not, plenty of other games to play.

This thing is crazy and wonderful. Each "play" recorded will be one full Lantern Year.  The world is brutal, the fights are epic, and the stories write themselves.  I've already had some awesome Survivor deaths, the Settlement is taking shape, and there is SO MUCH I haven't even seen yet!

I'm doing 1 campaign with my gf and one solo campaign.  They are playing out very different, even though I stuck with the same Principles. Hunt Events, different results on Story Events, and different gear priorities really change how things shake up.

[u]Thoughts[/u]: It commands a hefty price tag, but feels at every turn that the game is worth it -- the cards are velvety to the touch, the miniatures are gorgeous. The box is enormous, and when you put everything back in its place -- it will be packed to the brim with cards and tokens and unsavory monsters to hunt. Not to mention the 200 page rulebook is some sort of fantastic hybrid comic book, and holds surprising, magnificent [i]depth[/I].

And that's really where the game came through for me. It has the depth and replayability I want from such a major purchase. I can see I'll be intermittently playing campaigns of this for a long time to come.

One of the Best Boardgames I've played. As much as I like games like Gloomhaven, Cthulhu Wars, Zombiecide, 7th Continent and Folklore, none of them really  compare. Even 7th Continent isn't as much of a hook or rush; although all the games previously mentioned really are different animals. Perhaps Dark Souls would be the closest comparison, except that the Dark Souls AI is not nearly as deep and dynamic and Dark Souls also lacks the continuance, profoundness and extended theme of a settlement of survivors or larger pool of characters and culture to access for play.

 There's a Depth to Kingdom Death that the others don't have. The AI decks for the Monsters are much more organic or alive, not so mechanical or bland as most I've experienced. And the theme suites me personally, as it it a darker and more mature game in many ways. Whereas a lot of other games really are set more for children and young adults than actual adults. Not saying adults shouldn't play them, just KD:M is for a mature audience and some other games mentioned are probably more suitable for younger players, if you don't concentrate upon the violence of the adventure.

 Beyond that, the artwork is a combination of morbid beauty and grotesqueness as well as intriguing. The miniatures are top quality and highly detailed. The variations on crafting and crafting materials for gear are quite interesting and inspiring. The game draws one in immediately and keeps feeding the innate desire to survive as a settlement, even if your favorite character dies.

I had high hopes for this game and it actually delivered and surpassed my hopes. The rules are simple and intuitive, the rulebook is very clear and well constructed.

I love that the dungeon crawl part focuses on the tactics and abilities. Movement is important in the battles, your not just walking up to the enemy and pounding them, there is a lot more to it.

The miniatures are fantastic and I love the artwork and stark look of the whole package. The whole thing is very well produced.

And the best part of all is how the characters and the settlement develops. I've never seen a game that even comes close to the scope and depth of this game.

WARNING! ADULT CONTENT: First play with one other player each playing two survivors against the White Lion. We named our survivors of course to get survival - he used the names of his two children. We started off against the Lion tooth and nail, neither knowing what we would encounter.

We were landing blows and taking blows. His son landed a wound against the White Lion's gonads, but that just pissed him off. The Lion retaliated by tearing off his genitals but rest of us landed more wounds against the Lion, weakening him. Just when we thought we'd save our soprano friend, the White Lion disemboweled him and then stood over him. That allowed the rest of us to finish the Lion off, and we survivors trudged off to Settlement saddened by the loss of the brave boy but heartened by his sacrifice to save the rest of us...

The best game I've ever played.  Like everyone else, I was puzzled how such an expensive game could be "worth it".  I considered buying it for months and months and finally gave it a try with the back up plan of selling it and recouping costs if it wasn't worth the $$$ to me.  I will never sell this game :)  It has literally not left my game table since I first got it six weeks ago.  Every night I either play this game or work on painting and assembling (something else I never enjoyed before). 60+ hours of game play so far and no end in sight.

I realize this might not be the game for you but boy is it the game for me.  Since I got heavily into board gaming 6 years ago, I have literally been looking for this game.  Amazing solo experience.  

No, it isn't perfect.  But the overall experience is just so strong to me, I rated it very close to perfect.

I have now played the prologue solo and with one other person to familiarise with the rules.
The rule book is very well written and makes that first encounter flow quite easily. Saying that, I wouldn't recommend jumping into the game with your group without getting familiar with the rules and components and sorting out the cards first, even though it is what the game recommends. There would be way too many long pauses waiting while you are reading / flicking through / looking for cards which would hinder the immersion.
The first combat felt quite epic, the game mechanics were quite pleasant and straight forward, the White Lion was intimidating and it was definitely rewarding to win that first encounter. Death and injuries of characters are also quite graphic, which makes it very immersive. 
I didn't play with the miniatures as I wanted to see if we'd like the game before cutting them off their sprue. I played with meeples instead (and a bigger one for the Lion) which worked just fine. I was expecting very high quality components (cards and boards) and I have to say they delivered above my (already high) expectations. 
Saying that, there are tones of cards and their back looks subtly different from one another, the cards have a slight tendency to stick to each other and some decks are hidden in other decks, making it quite onerous when you have to look for one card in particular (it took me ages to find the first 2 principle cards for example..)
The first settlement choices felt great from a morality and thematic point of view, but I am not sure yet how they are going to translate into game mechanics as the game develops.
Crafting was maybe not as exciting as I thought it would be, mainly because we did not have a good strategic picture at this stage - do we need to save on some items, what item should we craft in priority,..
All in all, definitely a game that has the potential to be up there in my Top 10 and I am looking forward to my first group play / campaign !

40 ratings of 10, of which about 30 say "to balance the 1-ratings out"

You're all a bunch of idiots.  Except for the guy that rates this a 1 and writes "balance".  That is funny, and he's right, you know.  Balancing ratings are as dumb as the ratings that you're trying to balance.

And besides.  People who shelled out $500 to buy this, won't rate this game objectively.  You're emotionally attached to this game 'cause you're spending half a month's wage on it.

Someone make a price-ratings correlation graph of the top 1000 already.

The average rating of this game is probably 2 points more then it should be because of it being expensive, and the so called balance ratings.

I've heard great things about this new hamburger restaurant in town. Not a lot of people have gone to it yet, since it's very expensive and hard to get a seat, but everyone who has gone says it's unusually good.

The big day arrives and I finally get a place in line to order. When I place my order for a hamburger and fries, the employee informs me I can't technically order a hamburger and fries, however, if the person next in line is willing to order a double order, I could have half of his order and I would just pay him part of the money. Seems a bit odd to me, but whatever, I'm willing to experience it the way it was intended. However, at this point, another employee emerges and starts arguing with the first one, explaining that yes, since this is a Friday, I am allowed to order a hamburger and fries but only if I use the special Deluxe menu that was located in a different room. I ask the staff why they didn't just put the two menus in the same room and I'm met with quizzical looks and insistence that it's much better this way because it appears more "grand".  I also ask why they don't just have a menu on their website - like every other restaurant in existence - and they tell me there would be too many "spoilers."

Eventually, my order is placed. The staff appears to be taking a very long time to get everything ready, but the food does arrive. And indeed, everything looks stunning. I dive in and start eating. For the most part it seems to be a typical hamburger and fries, but the fries are much too big to fit in their container and tend to spill out all over the table. The hamburger also comes with five parts to its bun, instead of the usual two. There's some meat in there that's actually very tasty, but it's hard to get to because of the massive (albeit, impressive) bun. In particular, there's one bite of the hamburger that tastes remarkably, impressively good. I believe it's that part of the burger where the special sauce and pickle intersected in just the right way. Unfortunately, that moment passes quickly, and I continue on with the rest of the meal. I'm eating and eating, but the fries are just so huge I finally get tired of eating them and give up. Curiously, even though I've apparently eaten a lot, it doesn't feel like I'm getting very full and start to wonder if I missed some of the food inside the elaborate containers.   But before I can resolve this latest mystery, a large, bizarrely-dressed man rushes out of the back of the restaurant and storms over to my table.  Without saying a word, he grabs the table, violently upending it and scattering food and packaging everywhere.  I conclude that the meal is now over. 

Finally I'm ready to go and need to clear my tray and garbage. I head over to the garbage can, which is absolutely overflowing with trash. I ask the staff why they don't empty their garbage. They tell me they can't empty it today because it is indeed a Friday and the garbage is emptied twice on a Monday, but not at all on any other day of the week. However, they helpfully suggest I cram all the garbage into my pockets and carry it home with me, because that's what most of their customers do.

I leave the restaurant, intrigued, but confused. I take one final look back over my shoulder, admiring the glistening facade and gorgeous signage suggesting wonders within. I head back to my car, but remember I had to park it two lots over because the lot at the restaurant only had enough space for 3.5 cars. I often think about returning in the future, but decide I'd probably be better off just going somewhere that feels less like work.

And that's what playing Kingdom Death:  Monster feels like to me.

Shadows of Brimstone has a better character narrative than KDM.

KDM has a better settlement management system, crafting system, hunting, and AI deck.

But SoB has a more accessible world, thus is easier to world build. Characters aren't discardable like in KDM, and the idea that they're  like resources is off-putting. Not what I'm looking for.

I finally tried this bloated thing of a game, and I have to say it had some fun creating the village and deciding the course of the survivors will take. 

I was slightly bored by the combat system. One must be patient, I guess. I hope that with new weapons things will be a little bit smoother. Also the rules could be laid out better. If the monster "grabs" some figures, does it do so when they are on the ground? Questions not easily replied in the heat of battle... which slowed to a grind. 

Nonetheless I'm excited about this overproduced monstrosity, so I give it a temporary "8".

KDM is a monumental event in the history of board games. It is the first game i haver ever played which once finished caused me to take a long break from the board gaming scene as each board game i attempted to play after simply couldn't live up to the experience i just had. Eventually however after a month or two i did come back to board gaming and KDM is an experience i will never forget.

Even though the game seems to be an arena-like one, it is still interesting and worth trying... although, the price it will be at will be ridiculously high due to the great amount of miniatures unfortunately. :(
Gave it an 8.5 due to its replayability (especially if you add many different monsters in the main box) but less than a 10 due to the fact that it's an arena-like game.

Also, I removed a 0.5 because there are a few features that can be replaced with cards like the tables mentioned in the videos.

Reduced it to 7 because it it costs wayyy too much for the fun it gives.

A PC version (30$-40$) with miniature packs / extension that can be bought (5$-10$) on steam would be nice. It would eliminate a lot of dice rolls and table consultation.

Here we go--at long last, Warhammer Quest has a modern incarnation. The strange thing is that the battle phase is definitely second fiddle to expanding your settlement, which I actually like. The game is heavy on fun paperwork, so if you like that sort of thing this game is for you.
There is an intimidating amount of stuff on sprues, even before Kickstarter bonuses and expansions; but it's great fun as a (mediocre at best) mini builder to build your new custom survivors, and you only ever need one monster at a time so keeping things mostly WYSIWYG is not as daunting as one might initially think.
This is a real winner, capturing narrative, theme, and interesting tradeoffs for an excellent campaign experience. The cost and minis construction can and should keep some people away, but if you can deal with those things, this is an experience worth trying.
[EDIT] The Achilles heel of this as a game is the frequency with which you roll on tables whereby a 1 or a 2 results in instant death. It's not fun to have your settlement go from 12 population to 4 in one year due to event deaths (not combat deaths) that you did not seek. Judicious cheating, I think, is the only real recourse.

KD:M came out of no where for me. A friend suggested the group give it a go so we tried it, 8 hours later (and a sleepless night) the reveal of knowing nothing of KD:M to going 100mph was immense.

This is more than a game. It combines a really challenging and evolving boardgame and miniature hobby

The goods:
- Sense of progression 
- Inmersion
- Interesting and "intelligent" enemies 
- Can start playing in a few minutes because of a very good prologue
- Hobby aspect 
- Quality of components
- The art (this is subjective of course)

The not so good:
- Randomness (it can be minimized with strategy but it is there)
- Some rules are a bit complex to understand (survival points or collisions for example)


I rated a 10 because it absorbs me when I play and I am thinking about the game when I am not playing. I like to paint miniatures so that adds a lot as well. :). The game looks expensive but if you value like I do, it is a bargain!.

We played this game over a weekend with my friend. We counted approx. 26 HOURS(!) of gameplay just in three days! And we haven't even met the second Nemesis yet!

I don't know any other boardgame that works in so many levels as this one. Time literally flies when you carefully plan and optimize your moves and prepare your survivors — for their very brutal, nasty and quick DEATH.

This game is not for everyone, though. No. It's not. The Kingdom Death is hard, complicated, occasionally unfair game where you must make hard decisions all the time. And you need to be a good loser. Because you're gonna fail a lot. This is the game where you really, really appreciate those little, faint glimmers of light when the game gives them to you!

Just give me another turn and then I'll go to bed. I LOVE THIS GAME.

I rated it higher (an 8) when we first started our campaign. But I realized more and more that a) I don't like overly long campaigns and b) I am first and foremost a mechanical player. Almost everything in KD is a D10. Yes, I understand that with knowledge about the behavior pattern of the various monsters and the campaign events, you can plan what to hunt and how to equip your survivors much more effectively, thus increasing your chances. Of course, it is not all luck. And don't get me wrong, I have no problem with luck in games. 

Ultimately, KD is long, repetitive and random. Points (1 - long) and (2 - repetitive) I despise, especially when they occur together. The high amount of randomness might be fitting for the world of KD and at first even lead to silly/amusing results, but at least for me, it soon breaks down into frustration.

Oh hey lets fight the Kingsman for an hour and half, do the exact same thing over and over, get crushed and wait for the next lantern year to try again! No thank you. I love the idea of the story, the theme and the art direction. Otherwise the game is for masochists or accountants.

Interesting campaign-based settlement building game, mixed in with a some monster combat. There's a lot about this game that could be improved in terms of mechanics and interface, but it never quite gets bad enough to bog things down too badly.

Setting things up involves a lot of book-keeping (slightly less than a D&D campaign, but still substantial for a board game).

The actual combat is streamlined, interesting, but still frustrating (because the monsters are so much more powerful than the team that goes up against them).

The hunt is probably the clunkiest phase of the game, but still manages to create a nice amount of suspense.

The settlement phase is the fantastic part. I'm not sure how replayable it'll be, but it's a way to build a persistent little village for your survivors to inhabit and use as a home base. It's quite unique, and I'd honestly be interested in a game that's nothing but this, but there's currently no analogue.

That's basically the reason I like it. There is nothing else anything like this game out there.

I just can't get over the fiddly nature of this game, totally wrecks any sort of flow this game might have.  Checking the rule book every few minutes, changing boards, writing down info, erasing info, just too much "work".  When I play a game I like to have fun, make fun decisions and get immersed in the gameplay.  This game almost does that but ultimately falls short.  If there weren't so many ambiguities with the rules I might have been able to get past this.  What a bummer, $680 Canadian and now I have the most massive box on my shelf that I will likely never play again.  I would stay away from this game and play the 100's of other games out there that are much much better!

Yes, a thousand blood curling yes'es. This is an amazing creation, and a tribute to board games in general. I have never played something so engrossing, over the top and beautiful. Albeit, its not for everyone. I suggest you take an hour, or two, to read about everything you can. If you're still interested in the end, do yourself the favor and sell that liver.

Edit - 2nd video shows more of the 'game', it reminds me very much of WHQ one of the main inspirations, and owning that I'm not sure if I need this one yet. (You also see heavy Monster Hunter influence) Actually read the 22 page fan-made designer note document too and did some other poking around. My concerns are lack of outside play-testing, and will the decisions be interesting enough, as I don't need just another hack and slash then upgrade game. Lots of potential for sure, could be one of the best D&D type boardgames to hit the market, but it's hard to say how much of the potential will be harnessed with the current info available and no rules

Coming from a Pen & Paper RPG background, I used to think boardgames were the simple cousin to 'proper' Role-Playing Games. This game has blown my mind! From the unique art style, quality miniatures and dark, harrowing theme. This is a survival horror like no other.

Heavy pencil and rubber action, its worth while downloading some fan made tracking sheets for camp storage and alike. other than that this game is by far my favorite I've ever played. The game mechanics are genius and in-depth. the monsters have an artificial intelligence system that makes them behave differently on every encounter. you become attached to survivors only to have them die in a horrific manor... like in any good TV series, you care about the characters.

for an example of play please see my blog here

This is my brother-in-law's game and he is willing to do all the heavy-lifting almost like a DM who's also playing, otherwise I would not go near this monster. Otherwise, I've enjoyed the first couple plays with him running it.

I typically write extremely detailed reviews, but this one will be an exception as it can be simply rated a perfect 10.  From a world-building, thematic, quality, gameplay, and "returnability" standpoint, this is the best game out there.  Whoever purchases and plays it will not be sorry and will have hundreds upon hundreds of hours of fun.

The only downside is the very large price tag associated with the game which will put it out of the financial range (or logical/rational sense) of many people.  That said, as crazy as it sounds, this game is so good that it'd be hard to downrate it on that alone.  If you have the financial flexibility to get it, you won't ever regret the purchase.  Well probably won't so long as an unapproving significant other doesn't see the credit card bill...

RATING: 9.5
I have been playing the game on TTS ahead of its arrival. 

It is a frustrating, rewarding experience with extreme highs and lows. It is complex in a way that is entirely manageable, and varied in a way that feels organic. 

The quality of the game design is apparent, but can feel too random if you focus on the short term. 

My rating is high because I genuinely believe that KDM pushes board gaming forward. By creating a game that is intended for adults and doesn't shy away from mature themes and allows for assembly and customization, Poots has broadened the appeal of the hobby and bridged a gap between wargamers and boardgamers. 

There are those who don't want a game with mature themes who will subsequently pan this game, but if you feel that way, I have a suspicion this game wasn't made for you anyway.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (November 2017)

I finally played the fabled Kingdom Death monster. I initially pledged for it on KS, but later, I retired my pledge as I learned a little about the game and I´m very glad I didn’t support it. KDM is not a game I want to own or play.

The rules of the game are less complex that I was expecting, however, there are many rules so teaching the game takes at least 30 minutes. Playtime is very variable and it depends on the scenario. 

Love the theme.

The game´s components are AMAZINGLY good. The miniatures are incredible detailed, I love the art and in general, it has great production values. The game box is very big and heavy and the game is very expensive, but also overproduced and ambitious. It is gorgeous.

To me, KDM has a medium weight, I was expecting something much more difficult to play. The decisions needed to play the game aren’t very complex. I concede I have only played the prologue and it was hard to beat, but we didn’t have any issues with the decision making process, it is hard to pass due to luck considerations (you roll for everything). After you pass the scenario, there is another phase (I don’t know its name) but that phase is much more interesting to me. In that new phase new people are born, you distribute your loot, build equipment and buildings and you choose philosophies. In our game we became cannibals and we ate a fallen comrade, he was genuinely distressed about this, it was fun :D.

Another good thing about KDM is that you don’t own your character (besides killing you character seems pretty easy in the game). You can begin another scenario with a new character or you can use one created by a friend. This makes much more easy to play the game often. On the other hand, many players (scudding me) create a bond with their characters, and in KDM characters can and will die easily.
 
KDM is an Ameritrasher dream game, but I have been drifting away from this kind of game. My tastes have become much more Euro these past couple of years. Still, I could have bought the game if it wasn’t for the unassembled miniatures. This is THE deal breaker for me. I never buy games in which I have to assemble the miniatures and when I do (by mistake) I have sold them unplayed. I hate this activity and I won’t ever do it. 

When we were playing the game, a friend said he really enjoyed the game, but he said that if he is going to play a game like this, RPGs do a much better job. I can understand his point of view but I don’t share it completely.

The luck factor seems very high, which isn’t bad in this kind of game (Cooperative Ameritrash).

I have an inkling of desire to play the camping but I won’t do it. I think the game is very repetitive so I’m not sure how much game is really here, my gut says the game hasn’t the legs for me so I think it would bore me fairly quickly. I think the big appeal comes from the miniatures but they don’t work for me.

Best with 4 players.

Bottom line, I recognize that Kingdom Death: Monster can be a great game for many players, but it isn’t for me. I have a low desire to play the campaign so I don’t think I ever will. There are many other games that really excite me and KDM doesn’t. I would have enjoyed a game like this when I was a teenager, or maybe when I first began playing boardgames (2010), but now I have moved far away from this genre, I feel the game is very repetitive and what I enjoy the most is the phase after the fight, not the fight itself. KDM comes with unassembled miniatures which is a no go for me, there is no way I’m going to glue them together. KDM isn’t as complex as I was expecting. There is also the consideration of the price, I feel there is a bias here toward liking the game just to justify the high price, this behavior isn’t that uncommon with KS games. I prefer Myth over KDM, but I already sold Myth. KDM has a very high luck factor.

Unbelievable game. Absolutely fantastic. Some issues that make me not vote 10/10

* the rulebook, while gorgeous, is not functional. 
The sections
 are not clearly identifiable and the references within the book don’t have page numbers as the reference. The material is cogent, it’s a travesty that it isn’t easily accessible. 
* I cannot rate it a 10 due to how intense the miniatures hobby aspect is.  While I enjoy this aspect of the game, I don’t think that the vast majority of game purchasers do. I would hate to see someone purchase based on consistent 10 Ratings and be unaware of this aspect. 

All in all, cheers to Poots for creating this immersive and addictive game!

Kingdom Death Monster plays like a Dark Fantasy version of UFO: Enemy Unknown.  

You start with 4 survivors with very rudimentary equipment and abilities and are thrown into a fight against a White Lion monster, where the monsters actions and attacks are determined by a decision tree on A.I. cards you have to draw. 
After defeating it, you loot its body for resources and return to your homebase, were you decide how to use the resources and battle experience to upgrade your settlements facilities, population and technologies development. You alos built new equipment and manage your survivors progress, all the while a background event is happening that can support or hamper your base camp operations. 

After that, you send out a team of 4-6 hunters on a hunt, which plays a bit like those "Choose your own Adventure" books from Steve Jackson, where random events happen to your suvivors, again buffing, damaging or killing them on the way to their hunts prey. 

Once you reach your target, it's a battle again. 

This circle repeats itself, until you have defeated the final boss monster - the Gold Smoke Knight - or your settlement has died out. In the former event you'll have spend about 50+ hrs playing that one single campaign. And contrary to Legacy games, you can actually play it again. 

Kingdom Death: Monster might feel a bit cumbersome and uneven sometimes (there are some forced in roleplaying parts in there now and then, which might irritate pure boardgamers), but overall as sum of its elements it is a very entertaining and immersive experience. While you can play it in Solo-mode, it is much better enjoyed (or endured) with friends accompanying you during the campaign, sharing all the ups and downs of it. 

The miniatures of the Core Set are beautifully sculpted, once assembled. Yet, assembly demands some experience in the use of hobby knife, files (sanding), model building plastic glue and Green Stuff/Liquid Green stuff usage. 
Hobbyists coming from the Tabletop Wargaming angle will tackle the hurdle no problem, amateurs might feel it to be an overwhelming or sobering challenge to assemble the models, especially since some of them have a mulitude of parts, which (depending on the model built) sometimes don't fit properly into each other or leave quite annoying gaps. 
Here you should take your time slowly, because once assembled and treated well, they are awe-inspiring sculpts to behold, well worth the price. True pieces of art, well like the rest of the core boxes content. 

You can see, and feel all the creative love and energy that has been put into it in every corner of its design. 

The game goes heavy on the time it demands of you. Be it assembling the models, painting them, or playing the game, it will ask for your full devotion, care and karma to maintain it right. 

But if you are willing to give in to its demands, you will most definitely get back the money and time you have spent into it.

There is not much more to ask for.

KD:M is a weird game. It's only appeal is as a campaign, there is nothing interesting about doing one-shot fights. A lot of the fun is in leveling up between fights and managing the settlement. 

Pros:
+ Monsters each have their own deck making them feel unique. Similar to boss battles in a lot of video games. You may need to learn what they can do.

+ Players are managing a settlement, not individual characters. This means character death is much more acceptable and thus the game can be more brutal without causing the players to lose the entire campaign.

+ The decisions in the settlement phase can be interesting, and watching the settlement grow is a lot of fun. Also individual survivors get stronger which is also cool. The fun of leveling things up abounds.

Cons:
- You need to grind combat encounters to get the stuff you need to make better gear, to grind the next hardest combat to get the stuff you need to make better gear to... This cycle is fun in it's own way, but also kind of hollow and has you wondering why you're even bothering.

- There are not enough monsters to keep things interesting. You have to fight the same ones many many times and this can feel a lot like playing an MMORPG and farming for XP and loot drops.

- There are a lot of poor choices in how information is presented in the game. Things are not consistent and some things become hard to track because of the way they decided to present the information. E.g. survival bonuses when departing are not recorded in a central location.

- The art in the game objectifies women. I'm not going to investigate if horror blood porn is a thing, but if it is this must be some form of that thing.

- The level of randomness is high which diminishes player agency.

My go to game for campaign-based fantasy game. Best RPG experience to be had without DM.

I usually hate randomness to this extent. But it works for kdm, as it brings emergent storytelling and there are ways to mitigate risk with extended plays.

Vulgar misogynist miniatures with an interesting, but overly rated card based miniature combat system.  The female sculptures showing gratuitous amounts of skin for someone to be in combat with an other worldly horror are sure to be the delight of many individuals with a distorted image of femininity.  Not gonna lie, the monster sculpts are pretty cool, but this game certainly isn't worth to the vast majority of gamers what some people with a lot of disposable income are willing to pay for it.

Backed the 1.5 Kickstarter. Played 120+ hours on Tabletop Simulator. Still haven't made it past Lantern Year 12. 

I love roguelikes and feel like KDM fits into the category. Permadeath, starting over from the beginning, learning from your deaths, and getting better with every playthrough.

The game also has some cool emergent story aspects that create pretty vivid memories and experiences. Here's my all-time favorite:

4 survivors ventured out into the darkness to hunt the Phoenix. They were all fairly young -  a few fights under their belts but still pretty green in a lot of ways. A sudden blast of winter cold hit them while out on the hunt, and two of them froze to death (4 damage to each unarmored location - I realized later that you can't actually die from event damage on the hunt).

Not knowing anything but fear, darkness, and death, the remaining two survivors pressed on to fight the Phoenix. (The settlement didn't have the Innovation that allows them to run away or abandon the hunt.)

During the showdown, one of them was killed, and the other went mad, developing the Last Man Standing disorder, which meant he could only be killed with a severe injury, not by bleeding tokens. He kept taking severe injuries, losing limbs, getting blinded, deafened, and having his guts ripped out and trailing behind him - but kept dodging the severe injury rolls that would have instantly killed him.

Throughout the battle, the Phoenix also does something called Spiral Age, which literally makes a character get older. So my guy went from a young man, to a middle aged man, to an old man, to older than dirt, until finally he winked out of existence - living beyond his years.

In the Aftermath, I consulted the chart to see what happens, and rolled miraculously well. And what do you know? The guy mysteriously reappeared back at the settlement.

He left a young man then magically reappeared a few days later, a grizzled ancient old veteran with horrible injuries, all of his friends dead, and more than a few harrowing tales to tell.

RATING: 10
This game is a truly spectacular achievement in board gaming, and was somehow created by a first time designer.

It simultaneously creates:
A completely original world, that is rich and interesting and sometimes terrifying.  
Totally innovative game play, from the moment you start the introductory scenario you realize that this is a lot more than just a hack and slash and it only gets deeper from there.  
A unique system where the players create not one hero but an entire village, all of whom have their own history, lineage, experiences, scars and triumphs all of which impacts their own abilities.

Throw in some of the lowest lows and highest highs I have ever had playing a board game, the finest models I've ever seen in any game, an artbook with incredible full color original artwork on page after page after page.  And above all... it tells a story, a really great story from beginning to end that is different each and every week, month after month and hopefully year after year.


This game and Gloomhaven have redefined what a 10 is for me.

Its narrative atmosphere makes it a great game for me and my wife to play together. The rules are actually fairly simple even if there are a lot of moving parts. The game oozes with theme and the stories that come out of it will almost ease the eye twitch you pick up when a bad couple dice rolls renders your village MVP dead or impotent. Even with the random events, I still feel that player action goes a long way to preventing tragedy, so smart play is rewarded while mistakes are severally punished. The price of entry is certainly a barrier, but I would say it is well worth the investment if you have a few people willing to walk along the cold stone faces with you.

This is something out of the space. First of all, there is huge value in miniatures hobby, the minis are better quality than GW and are a pleasure to assemble and paint. Second the game successfully merges two things - skirmish miniature game and RPG settlement / character development. Both supported by awesome lore and artwork. I highly appreciate the AI/HL deck concept for managing monsters during skirmish. Items remind me hard grinding from Diablo PC game series. Really great game based on mitigating rolls, learning meta about the dangers and original piece of lore.

Now that I've played the game I must admit that it was a blast. I'm normally not a huge fan of the hivemind co-op games, but the setting and the history that unfolds along with a pretty solid combat system does deliver what Adam promised.
After playing this alot more, I've upped the rating there much more depth in the mechanics than it first appeared. Also fact that the rolls on the tables are a wildly random factor is part of the fun/hard obstacle this game proves to be.

Old note from before release, I still cannot get why there are still votes from people who haven't played the game and don't intent to, but shame on them for ruining the rating system. 

Balance and since no one have played the finished version yet I'll look at the basic mechanics og components.
Components seen so far is of the highest qualite on the marked, better than the tabletop models out there.
Mechanics looks interesting, while I do like the competetive elements of a game, this contains some of the best ideas I've seen for a co-op game, but we just have to wait and see when the game gets out.
Please note that I do hate voting on a game I haven't played but I also hate seeing people downvoting something becourse they don't think they would like it.

RATING: 6
Arcane, Baroque, Freudian, Horrorific, Opulent.

Judging purely based off the mechanics, and the production. The game is exquisite however, I cannot recommend it as it is probably one of the most difficult games to procure, and the theme will turn off anyone with a tinge of traditional values.

Finding concrete information on the game is a quest of obverse investigation of outdated information as well as sparse videos. The creator will not release a copy of the rules in pdf format, grating against the conventions of the industry. The game capitalizes on the unconscious of the internet: anti-social, voyeuristic, 

The mechanically from what I can tell the game is composed of layers of puzzles on top of puzzles. Risk-taking is built into every crevice of the game.

There are two main portions of the game, the settlement phase where the players develop their settlement, craft items, have relationships, learn technologies. The second portion is the hunt where players stalk prey and eventually will lead to a showdown where they fight for survival and loot.

The settlement phase provides an element of respite from the stress of combat. The combat is interlinked with the relationships and civilization developed from the settlement phase.

I really like the game and I want to play more. See how things develop and the story unravels in tiny bits.
For me the best phase is the settlement one. Choosing what to craft or build, in which things spend endeavours are really thrilling and have a huge impact in the future.
The combat in the showdown is pretty awesome too. At first it seems very simple but when you start gaining new survivals actions, fighting arts and gears and you learn how to combine them  it changes everything. The combat have more tactic than - get next to the monster / hit / repeat -
 
The hunt phase is the least phase I like. It's just ok. It shows you some lore from the world and things that happen in it. But there is little decisions to make. This keep the game from a 10.

Who should play Kingdom Death? Lets give an example.

Let's say you've built a nice community with Lincoln Logs, and along comes some little prick who kicks your buildings over.  What kind of person are you?

If you are the type to get upset, pout, and leave swearing never to build again with that twerp around... then Kingdom Death is not for you.

If however, your natural reaction is to immediately start rebuilding while thinking of ways to sneak large cans of spaghetti sauce, or even better, bricks inside your buildings so the next time the little prick kicks your buildings down he'll break his frickin' toes... then Kingdom Death is probably the best game you will ever play.

[b]3: Poor game. Will strongly resist playing.[/b]
A friend of mine went all in on this. It just didn't click with me. I have no attachment to the theme, and the game itself is just the same thing over and over again. Hunt, gather resources, spend those resources, again, and again ad nauseam. No real variation except deciding what to hunt. By the 3rd play, it felt more tedious than anything. I cannot imagine trying to play this solo with all there is to keep track of.

The mini's themselves are great works of art, but great minis does not make a great game. I also cannot imagine having to assemble everything for this game. So glad Mythic Battles: Pantheon doesn't require assembly. :P
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.9
This game is on a completely different level from the rest of the board games I own.  It's almost unfair to compare it to them because it is on such a grander/deeper scale.

They call this a "boutique" board game because it was designed from the ground up to cater to a small, unique audience and favors quality design over mass production.  This wasn't really meant to even sit on a hobby shop shelf.

Every piece of the game was designed with care.  Components are spectacular, several notches above most other games.  The "manual" resembles an art book from a collector's edition video game rather than an instruction source.  But it does wonderfully to teach you to play the game.  The markers, tokens, dice, and even the box itself are all wonderfully designed and have a rich artistic flair.

The game is as deep as it is amazing to look at.  The core game alone could take you years to fully explore, with dozens of highly detailed minis to build and paint.  It's essentially a survival role-playing game where you control a team of vulnerable people who have to make do with very little to survive in a very deadly environment.  Each of your colonists will make life-changing choices for better or worse, develop skills in weapons, abilities, and temperament.  They will be born, go on adventures, age, and eventually die if not when they are old, then by some other catastrophe.

Each of your colonies can last for real life months, while you play from session to session.  You will create stories and memories of certain members of your survivors and what they went through, their victories, and failures.  If all of your survivors die, it's game over and you start from scratch.  It will take many colonies and probably many years to fully explore the game's lore and environments.  That doesn't even factor in the many expansions for the game.

There's really no other comparison to any other game I own, this is hands down the best board game I've ever played and probably will be for a while.  I only keep this from being a 10 because the game is so hard to find, the price is so steep, and the customer service is not so good (which are all separate from the game itself, but whatever).

While I understand that this game won't appeal to everyone, for me, it falls into a wonderful place that I absolutely love!  The campaign nature of play, resource acquisition, gear crafting, and settlement "tech tree" aspects are all mechanics that I absolutely love, along with an interesting miniature-based combat engine.  I don't really enjoy the miniature assembly / painting aspects at all, but the dark theming and actual game play are incredible from my perspective.  I've been playing a friend's copy whenever possible, and my wife and I got in on the latest kickstarter this time around, excited to run our own games in the near future!

RATING: 8
that's a great great game only if:
you want to play a long campaign with 3 more friends.
you want to play solo.
you love horror games were you lose a looot of characters (called here survivors) to brutal monsters or lack of luck.
you love building set of armor, weapons, to power up characthers.

Basically it's a game of survival of a few survivors against monsters. well the monsters are at the same time antagonists and resources, cause you farm monster to build up your settlement and make better weapons and armos.

the game go in turns: 
1 develop settlement (survivors are born, make weapons and armos from dead monsters, build settlement locations, play random events).
2 hunt a monster. there is some casual card and dice rolling see what happen when you hunt. 
3 fight the monster. the fight can be pretty brutal.

and it mix flavor from RPG, a strong background, and a story to follow.

last thing every campaign is always different, cause the monster beaviour is generated from specific deck. every monster have a deck of action, and is somewhat different every time you play.

I wanted to give it a "9". But give "8" only because it need a looooot of space. the board is huge, and there is a lot of cards, and the sheets of survivors. so if you don't have much space is hard to play.

Kingdom Death: Monster is more of an RPG game than a board game, it tells you a story as you play it and the lore and text tells that story in a very detailed, dark and gory way which I love.

Make no mistake, this game is very hard. You'll die with many of your favorite characters in the simplest of ways. Even walking in a field of grass might end up killing you. However that makes the wins and progression so much more enjoying. There's a great level curve here, monsters you thought were incredibly hard the first time becomes rather easy as you figure out how to/not to attack them and get better gear.

Very fiddly, there's ALOT of content and playing it solo you will have to keep track of 4 survivors and all their stats for every move. 

100+ hours of fun, amazing component quality, great gameplay and replayability.

The reasons this isn't a 10 is the cost, it's not flowing as smoothly as I'd like because it's so fiddly and I hate it when a really good character dies just because of a very bad roll of the die.

No secret is made about how down right brutal and hardcore this game is; characters can die permanently on the roll of a single dice, the artwork is grotesque and the theme is positively disturbing... however it's also strangely addictive. Learning how to hunt the monsters and watching you settlement develop is very satisfying, even if the settlement phase seems to take more time than the actual game itself. My only fault with it is that EVERYTHING is utterly random, to the point that the lack of control can get annoying.

Breathtaking game. Completely engages players in a First Story narrative that is nearly impossible to put down. I've brought this game to friend's houses during board game nights, and it's capitalized on them, changing them into Kingdom Death nights. All players easily get sucked into the puzzles that are doable but difficult. Would easily recommend to anyone over 18.

First of all,I'm a big fan and collector of KD minis.
The concept and theme of the game is simply.... original and I just love the dark,cruel and sick atmosphere the world of KD has.
I'm astonished by the artwork as well.
The two videos shed quite some light about how it plays in general.
When the game arrives I will rate accordingly.
Till that moment,for what I've seen and know this far, it gets a 7.  

Edit.
The game arrived the 10 remains

This is an actual rating based on actually playing the game. Not based on speculation or hate.

...

I've played a few showdowns now and I really like it. It is hard and brutal and mean... But there is a great sense of discovery and wonder as well. I would give the game a 10 (it's exactly what I was looking for) but I need to play more to see if the difficulty ends up eventually killing the fun.

I may need to find ways to slightly adjust the difficulty... if it's too brutal my gaming group will not want to keep playing it. 

I love the combat AI systems... each time you face the same enemy type they have a different personality and attack style but by the end of the showdown you have learned what to expect from them (and hopefully developed a tactic to overcome them)- this is super unique and exciting!

For the right people, this game is the Holy Grail of Board Games. Seriously, there might be people that only need KD:M on their shelf and nothing else.

Myself and two others have dumped a pretty serious amount of time into this game already, and are nearing the end of our first play all the way through.

I've started three different games with three different groups, it is always enjoyable. 

This game is expensive and will continue to be expensive, as I feel like expansion content is probably necessary for continued play.

Oh boy- this one could be a problem. The mechanics are fairly simple and there's a HUGE helping of luck, but the connection I feel to my survivors and their settlement is compelling. I've spent 12 hours in the last three days exploring this odd, dark world and I can't stop thinking about it. Even the luck-factor feels right in a game where life is tragic and violent and short. So far this is well worth early-bird pledge and the lengthy wait.

As far as a monster hunter/ civ building game this takes the cake. The AI deck changes even the same monsters to make every battle feel different, from getting lucky and rolling 3 10's in a row and crushing a monster's windpipe, in the second round of combat, to destroying the monster's "Manhood" and enraging the monster to TPK us. This game creates lots of stories that you'll remember after the game. Only complaint is that the kits go a little too far into customizing your characters.

I think the buying-in price of this game is absurd however you look at it! I spent months studying the ins and outs of this game online, umming and ahhing constantly with the should I/shouldn't I argument for investing in this dark board game behemoth. After missing two kickstarter opportunities I smashed my credit card in on the KDM website's Black Friday Sale, afraid that if I missed the game again there might never be another opportunity. I now own the 1.5 edition only, and with the aim to help others make their yes/no decision I will try to share as much experience as I can about the game as I get into it.

As of 25/1/18 I have yet to play it. The game's extensive modelling requirements will keep the game off the tabletop for a long while yet. I have years of experience with modelling from Games Workshop games, but KDM is still a daunting task to assemble and paint- you don't want to mess up any part of your Platinum priced investment so extreme care is required! I currently sate my thirst to play by regularly following play through series on Youtube, which in turn fuels my will to continue the modelling as well.

Some notes on the component quality. The miniatures are indeed beautifully crafted and made of an exceptionally decent quality of plastic. It cuts clean, and is both flexible and strong enough to avoid the nasty 'snip brakes' I sometimes get from cutting Warhammer minis from their frames. The assembly level required is expert though, and although superglue gel bonds the pieces well these miniatures seem to come in many more tiny pieces then I feel is necessary. Some models have every limb segmented into several pieces each, making a 3D nightmare jigsaw puzzle which involves having to match up, position and bond load bearing parts such as legs that will then have to be perfectly posed when everything is dry to both stand flat on a base and support the rest of the model! 'Dry fixing' to double check all segments are in the correct place and are going to fit as intended is essential. There's no assembly instructions in the box either, although website support is available. I recommend www.vibrantlantern.com over the official assembly instructions, as the official website is not only less detailed but is shamefully missing a couple of model guides altogether!

The non-miniature components are a little less polished, at times showing a peculiar disparity in quality. The rulebook is amazing- huge, beautiful and bound in hardback with two bookmarks. The cards are also suitably sturdy feeling, although I intend to sleeve the heck out of the more commonly handled decks (gotta look after that investment). The box is also a beast- it dwarfs most other board games, and its nearly a centimetre thick! Then comes the most disappointing part- the cardboard components. The chit tokens, game board and scenery are ugly as hell. I feel the board would have been fine with just a solid and minimalist 'plain of faces' design across the whole thing, but it has a strange symmetrical feature with a giant ball of light bang it the middle of it. This looks terrible! The scenery is also god awful looking with a flat, concept-art level of detail on solid black backgrounds. These cardboard components are just such a sharp contrast to the quality of the minis its a bit of a shock, and I don't feel they reflect the value of this game at all. I am pulling on my modelling experience to buy and build 3D pieces of scenery to replace the card pieces. Doing so will really bring the battles to life whilst drawing the eye from that ugly board!

Its very obvious that the models are the original focus of KDM, and this makes sense considering that the KD crew has been around putting out its more 'risque' brand of fantasy miniatures for a while before this games creation. Outside of the basic starter survivors and handful of monsters and bosses there's several sprues of armour sets in the box, allowing you to make several custom survivors armed and armoured with all the varied gear in the game. This is a cool idea at a glance, but on further inspection its actually kind of dumb. Survivors die all the time, so you don't want to make any custom models to represent your favourite dudes- they'll most likely be dead within a few sessions! Outside the 5 bosses there are also just 3 monsters in the box you can hunt. This means in an average campaign you will fight each basic quarry monster over and over and over and over again. Perhaps having just the 4 starter survivors and then giving us 3 extra monsters to hunt rather then a bunch of armour sets in the box would have been a major boon for the game? Nope, release all the extra monsters as equally exclusive expansions that each cost about 1/6th the the game itself! This is a major misdirection to me- I want more monsters with the option for armour sets, not armour sets with the option for more monsters! I suspect I'm not the only one that feels this way..

Coincidentally I aren't bothered by any part of the art direction. I am of course referring to KDM's adult themes, which have made the game notorious on here for some reason. Its bleak, disturbing, obtusely perverse and darkly beautiful throughout. You don't have to like the adult themes, but don't bother flaming about it to those that do. Artistic freedom was a big selling point to this game, and it shows. Art is whatever it wants to be, and shouldn't be restricted or repressed. I get what they were going for, I accept it.

Got to sneak out of my booth long enough to play the full Phoenix demo at GenCon. I'll admit i was a little skeptical about the game play as the minis were almost to good to be true, but there was only one way I could describe the experience...

Epic. 

While the difficulty was ramped up to give an impression of the mid game, what started as ogling at the beautiful components soon turned into a brutal struggle of survival for life and death.  What we fought was not a monster, ney, it was a dark god who's own bowels rained divine annihilation and who's own sphincter could suck a man whole into a void so dark his grip on reality would be torn asunder becoming a stranger unto himself.  

This was no "hunt". 

Limbs torn from bodies, spleens crushed, skulls exploded, reproductive organs castrated by multiple beaks. Hopes dashed as a dieing man's final desperate attack was thwarted by stopping time it's self and impaling the doomed through a tree of corpses. 

did i mention it poops death? it poops death. 

This game is the shit and I want to thank Adam and the KD team for their tireless pursuit of perfection. I promise those of you who waited, it was worth it.  Fan or not, KD is wholly new league of game, "boutique" and unique, that at best will define it's genre and worst provide a trophy worthy conversation piece to your collection.

When I first saw KD:M on Kickstarter, I thought the minis looked cool but I took a pass and forgot about the game. Too much money and too little understanding what the game was about or if it would be any good.

Fortunately, I have a friend who owns a copy.  I must say that I'm impressed with the depth, thematic elements, and unique mechanics.  Our campaign is brutal but so much fun.  It can be a "lifestyle game" due to the time commitment, expansions,  and hobby (modeling & painting) aspects of the game.  

My main quible is that every thing is jammed into the landscape format rulebook - rules, charts, story events, etc.  These need to be in seperate books or put in a tabbed, spiral bound book.  The glossary in the back is a lifesaver.

Almost impossible to find fault with this game that isn't price-related: utterly gorgeous miniatures (albeit tricky assembly required) for heroes and monsters, totally compelling and uniquely themed world, fantastic and often horrific art, gripping and addictive campaign play, brilliant solo or in a group, amazing narratives emerge from each session.  Yep, this is pretty much as good as board gaming gets. 

In our last session our survivors were being slowly mulched by a screaming antelope until it swallowed one of us whole, who was then able to fight his way out of its insides and burst out of its body in a red shower of gore, killing the beast as he did so.  In what other game can you do that??

An amazingly thematic and dynamic co-operative miniatures skirmish / resource management game. Very akin to the video game franchise Demon/Dark Souls and the manga Berserk in theme, it is a harsh and unforgiving game but immensely satisfying when you see your settlement grow and the survivors develop character entirely through the emergent storytelling inherent in the rules and 'story events' the game hangs bases itself around.

Quite complex and featuring lots of randomness (there are rolls and results tables for almost everything), but plenty of flavour to go with each one of them, and both the rulebook and pacing of the early campaign does a great job of teaching it.

This game really hits the sweet spot for me.  I find the difficulty to be quite rewarding.  This is a game that has a long campaign but the expectation is that you won't make it through the first time.

You play as a group of people who wake up in Hell and start trying to build up a colony.  It has elements of a Civilization Builder with combat that mirrors a series of Dungeon Crawler boss fights.

The game feels deceptively random and arbitrary (which fits the game's theme well) but almost all of the more deadly situations can be planned around and avoided by savvy players.

You need to choose what to build from the monsters you hunt, which will be the gear for your adventurers on the next hunt..  Every few years there is a "Nemesis Monster" that comes to hunt you- it is important to plan for the next nemesis with the things you build (just hunting the easiest monsters will catch up to you when the nemesis arrives).

There number of things that you can do in the campaign dwarfs the things you have time for.  And the resources you have to work with (some of the gear and character abilities) are random to an extent- meaning that no two campaigns can be played exactly the same.

The campaign's learning curve is pretty smooth- the first few fights will just be getting used to the system, and as you go on, you'll need to start incorporating more complex strategies involving your positioning and planning (also, the expansions get quite complex, and generally increase the difficulty).


Most of the expansions replace monsters from the core box.  This game definitely encourages players to start new campaigns right at the finish of the first ones.

So, I don’t mind tits and ass. Not at all. But it’s kinda sad that this game will mostly be remembered as The Tits & Ass Game…

‘Cause it’s a really fun game…

One session will typically consist a hunt sequence, a fight against a monster, and then you upgrade your village.
The hunt is a bunch of rolls on a random table. Some of the results are a bit… unfair… Then again, some are really beneficial. Those are just hard to remember when your experienced character got removed due to a random event with no choices involved…

The monsters you fight are controlled by a deck of AI-cards. Deadlier monsters have more cards with nastier effects. Whenever you hurt a monster, it loses cards, making it more predictable. Once the AI-deck is empty, the monster is defeated.
This is a lot deeper than I first thought, especially once your characters start getting better and acquires more equipment.
Also, the various monsters behave differently, requiring vastly different tactics.

Also, some of the hunts are replaced by Nemesis fights. 

Once this is over, things happen in your settlement. Children are born, old people retire, characters might get exiled or die. Culture is developed, new buildings and technologies are innovated.
I did not expect this part about the game, and I got to say it’s the best part. Seeing you tiny village of survivors slowly grow into a somewhat respectable settlement is really engaging.
Again, the game can be very unfair. Don’t expect female characters to survive giving birth to the next generation…

From what I understand, the idea is that your first (few) villages will eventually die because you run out of survivors. Then you start over with a new village and (hopefully) learn from your mistakes. Eventually you make it all the way through the story and face The Watcher...

So I’m rating this as a 9. The above mentioned unfairness has not struck me yet, and we are on the verge of encountering The Watcher. Not a single character has died for me. The one that was rendered unplayable was miraculously healed.
Had I suffered the dangers of childbirth a few times I guess I might’ve reduced the rating to an 8 :P

Unlike anything else I own. Well worth the premium price tag.  My only gripe is that some of the art is a bit nasty. I know it's a horror game, but if I never have to see the image on the brain trauma roll table again I'll be happy. I printed out the tables from bgg so I don't have to use the rule book all the time.

The game tells a story like no other and is incredibly engrossing. Building a settlement is fun, and it is heartbreaking when one of your survivors dies because of an event, especially if they have rare irreplaceable gear.

Gave it a 10 early on, knocked down because of some unfinished randomness that is sometime unfair (sudden deaths etc). Still love it.

After hearing tons of (controversial) stuff about the game, I surprisingly had the chance to play the copy of a friend of a friend for a few "years".

So to get the theme/artwork part put of the way: I'm in general not huge on the horror theme, but afterall the general idea of fighting through and building somewhat of a society in this really horrific world actually isn't too bad and somewhat interesting and initially I even didn't mind some of the (let's call it) more "mature" parts, but after a while I personally found a lot of things to be on the "teenagers faking their IDs to pretend they are of full age" matureness level, which is unfortunate, because it pushed it over to the silly side for me. 

Despite hearing a lot about theme/artwork, I didn't actually know much about the gameplay and when tought the general idea and structure of the game I was REALLY intrigued. Slowly building up a civilization with resources you get from hunts and the RPGness of the whole thing just is a great concept. 
Unfortunatly in the end the gameplay had a similar impression on me as the theme: I started to be convinced by it as there are a lot of individual interesting things in there (the general idea to first hunt and then fight the monster and eventually use the resources to build up your settlement and gear, the AI cards of the monsters in the fight, the characters gaining abilities but also injuries and other flaws and probably lots of other small things i might be forgetting now) BUT eventually the game didn't really work for me when all of it came together. There was too much fiddlyness, randomness, repetition, grinding and "rock falls, you die" annoyance and too little actual choices. I actually kept thinking that the more interesting abilities and variation is on the part of the monster, so I almost got annoyed by the fact that it somewhat feels like "the game" itself is actually having more fun playing than me (which would be fine if the game would pay tons of for me to play, but if I do by a game, I kind of expect to have more fun than the cardboard).

I've noticed that since I'm playing DnD on a more regular basis, games that try to emulate an RPG without a DM in boardgame-form fall flat for me maybe more now than they did before, because it just doesn't compare to the experience and in many cases it just makes me want to play either a "pure" boardgame or a "pure" RPG but not a weird mix of both. 

So maybe the best way to express my thoughts on the game are speaking of it in terms of an actual RPG. Because it feels like my problem with KD:M is that you actually get two things in that box: An RPG system and a DM running that system. And while I think that I might actually enjoy the system itself quiet a bit, the DM that comes with it is just really horrible (focusing on the wrong parts of it, dragging out the least interesting parts and having a rock randomly fall on you whenever he needs to go and get a drink - and you better drink or the "mature jokes" get old very quickly).

I am not %100 sure how to rate this game. The components and story telling are wonderful. The game play is pretty decent. Having to switch some of the boards around between events is a little clunky. Combat was fun but we fought the lion 3 or 4 times so it felt a little grindy. Maybe a few more play through would improve my score. Once again the components and story telling are great. I just felt like we repeated the same fight over and over again to get resources to make gear. The combat AI is clever and the story telling choices are great.

I love cooperative miniatures games like Mice and Mystics, Imperial Assault, and Descent, but can't always find people to play them with and sometimes replaying the same campaign gets boring.

Words fail to describe even the awesomeness of looking the mate box towering over your game table.

Components are super high degree.

This is the first game i have actually fully sleeve to maintain as pristine as possible.

I would grade this game box as a collectors edition already, and puts to shame most(if not all) of other collectors editions i have played in the past.

This KS was a running joke in game group, as I joined the kickstarted when my game group just started. 
For the last year, several jokes where made about this been "vaporware" game, a illusion, and some investment on amazing minis , and (maybe) a ok-ish game.

NOT so, The game rules are solid. Gameplay is fun, intuitive, and engaging. This game is a masterpiece, punishing and rewarding when beating against a unrelentless environment versus the weak humanity and its tenacity to fight on, regardless the odds.

I would grade 11/10 if i could, this has rised the bar to measure my other games. My previous 10s and 9 games, would rather be 9 and 8s now, measuring with this as the top a boardgame can aspire to reach.

The more I play Kingdom Death the less I like it.

First couple of games were great.  The Monster AI is a brilliant design and well worked out.  I like the fact that the fights are hard and death is a constant threat for your characters.  Growing your settlement, getting gear and looking after your little civilization is cool.

After a few more games the repetitive nature of the game became apparent to me.  There's not that many creatures and to get the right sort of resources to build sets of gear you have to fight the same monster again and again.  The fights take place in a barren, pretty much featureless arena.  The Monster AI itself almost takes the role of terrain in these fights, which is great the first couple of times you fight a creature and you're learning how it works.  Once you've fought the same monster many times fights become tedious.  There's an awful lot of grinding for resources in this and it's not particularly fun.

I like the fact that the fights are dangerous and your characters very much could die in each fight.  I hate the random hokey deaths that often befall your character due to random dice roll encounters or card draws outside of the fights.  Losing a character through an epic fight = fine.  Losing a character because I rolled a 2 instead of an 8 on a random card that you cannot plan for = well, funny the first couple of times actually but quickly becomes rage inducing when you realise you've got to start the bloody awful grind of building your a new character up again from scratch.

The setting is very dark, humourless and frankly a bit distasteful.  I didn't mind this for a while but after grinding our way through several months of doom, despair and monsters with genitals for faces I don't care if I never set foot in Kingdom Death again.

In summary - bold design choice with some great new mechanics.  Campaign becomes a boring slog though.

After multiple plays, this game is equal parts civ-builder, lite-RPG, horror-themed dungeon crawl and work of art.  The theme and components are perhaps the best I've ever seen!  The RPG aspects are simple for anyone who has played a pen/paper RPG but have been confusing for those in our group who don't have that experience.  I see lots of potential in civ-building... I don't know how deep it gets but I've really enjoyed the ability to shape a unique society based on our choices.  The combat has little strategy initially but really expands once your characters, equipment and quarry improves.  The AI deck is really just a random effects table in deck form.

***NOTE: I'm starting to think that KDM is not so much a game but a random horror-story generator.  Life or death can ride on a d10 roll that comes with some cool flavor text.

Extremely impressed with the artwork and design. It's a lot of fun to build up the base and take down a new boss. Some questionable balance but I guess dying is part of the fun. It's basically the board game version of Darkest Dungeon. It's a game that would take many weeks to really finish, so finding a group for that is going to be tough, but the fact that there can be up to 20+ different characters at any time makes it easy to drop in and out on a week to week basis.

This may change later, but I am honestly in love with this game. I can't stop thinking about it. The fights are strategic and tactical, with wildly varying approaches to different enemies (and even the same enemies, based on their AI deck and setup). The Settlement phase is rife with decision-making and choices that will affect you years and years down the line. The Innovation deck is an amazing feat; basically a tech tree, but the innovations you have have vast known and unknown consequences, and all are exciting. Your society principles are based on philosophical approaches to society and life, and have far-reaching consequences. The resource gathering and equipment crafting is deep and rewarding. The narrative...

By God, the narrative. I am in awe of the narrative in this game. This game is honestly a design wonder in the way that it accomplishes such vast and interesting storytelling through GAME RULES ALONE. The flavor text in this game is relatively minimal for the amount of actions, consequences, and events that occur. The story is told through effects carried out in the relatively straightforward game rules. Consider the following:

A principle of life you can pick is called Survival of the Fittest, as opposed to Protect the Young. The card text is "when you roll for Intimacy, roll twice and use the lower result. Children born get +1 strength". Protect the Young is "when you roll for Intimacy, roll twice and choose your result". There is no flavor description, no florid text, yet the game rules alone tell a huge story. For the first one your child mortality rate will be fairly large (lower rolls on the Intimacy table cause fetal death, and possibly the death of the mother as well), but children that do survive will be strong. The second one you will have many more successful births, but the children will be average, completely encapsulating both principles into a short game text yet weaving a narrative of societal impetus. Everything in the game is like this. While there may be small snippets of description as to what is going on the end result it stories told from effects, not from florid prose. Even if you lose this game after many hours of playing (a successful campaign probably takes about 60 hours, failed campaigns less) your society has had a rich history that, due to the myriad events that can happen, only yours has experienced. Additionally, the setting is fascinating.

Oh yeah, and the minis are fucking dope.

The game is extremely beautiful and atmospheric, in a haunting sort of way.  Gameplay is interesting and largely innovative with unexpected choices presenting themselves frequently.  Combat is good, although somewhat basic in terms of dice rolling mechanics.  The ai decks are where the innovation lies, with no two encounters playing out the same.  Strategic positioning matters greatly as well as player cooperation since death is a very real danger in combat (also out of combat).  

The best part of the game is the settlement and hunting phases.  Both manipulate your choices and make you really think about what should be done.  Although the limited number of events may make the game predictable on future playthroughs, settlement events don't repeat themselves within the same 20-25hr campaign and all events feature numerous outcomes. 

Some dislike the use of dice rolling for the outcomes of events, but the rolling does not detract from the game but rather enhances it.  The story that forms from the successful and failed rolls is usually compelling.  Even a a failure is thematic and interesting, occasionally even benefiting you more than a success would.  These events reflect the nature of the game world itself: the survivors have no real control over their world, just the ability to endure what comes their way through planning and exploration.  

Customization is key throughout the design of the game. Needless to say, you get what you pay for just in terms of miniatures but the game is fantastic on its own.  A hobbyist's dream, although I can understand how the game can be intimidating to those people who do not like to (or simply lack the skills to) assemble miniatures.  

Note to the developer: the game is good enough that it could be featured as a standalone release without miniatures but rather with cardboard standees.  It would remove a bit of visual flair but likely reduce the costs enough to get more players in and counter some of the critics who decry the cost of the game.

*Edit* Was a 9.5 now a 10.  Only board game I've cut class for in order to play more.  Never played anything like it before but it always leaves you wanting more.

This is my first major foray into tabletop gaming (Although I've been an avid gamer for quite some time). I'm a 1.5 backer so I haven't played through a full campaign as of yet, but I am incredibly impressed with KD:M in almost every possible way. The amount of depth that this game has, along with the exciting (albeit random) gameplay, results in a masterpiece of a board game. For people who are looking for a "fast and fun" style game, this is not for you. KD:M is definitely a game that requires patience, understanding, and a hand full of luck. Also, someone recommended this in another review, and I definitely want to reiterate it: Look at your survivors in KD:M as chess pieces - not as your personal "avatar". Don't get attached to them, rather get attached to your settlement as you pick and choose which pawns should go out on the next hunt. The rulebook is INCREDIBLY detailed from what I've read so far, and the glossary in the back definitely helps out with trying to figure out what each keyword on the cards means. Once I finish a full campaign, I'll update my review, but I'm sure I'll still have the same outlook on KD:M as I do now.

its good, but I like gloomhaven better.  the boss fights are great and the settlement part is fine, but the hunt part is a bit unrealized.  it is certainly dark, but maybe too much so.  the randomness for having characters die is ok, but just not my preference.

RATING: 9
The game mechanics of Kingdom Death: Monster are unique, allowing for a creative approach to cooperative board gaming.  A dark approach to the unknown, where hardships are looming over party with every step you take.  It is the mounting difficulty of King Death: Monster that adds to the fun, and makes every near death experience a small victory. 

The miniatures included with the game are outstanding, filled with character and details that will keep painters coming back for more.  I enjoy playing this game and recommend it to anyone willing to pay the high price tag, which I believe is absolutely worth the investment.

Great fun so far! Narrative produced by the sheer amount of rabdom, flavourful stuff is exactly what I'm looking for in board games.

Might jump up to ten for me. But stay away if you value balance and fairness higher than emergent storytelling!

RATING: N/A
Not for everyone. SU&SD: "[KD:M] is the period in time where board gaming entered the Prog Rock, or psychedelic rock era... and like so much music from that period of time, it is excessive, it is extraordinary, it is embellished for the sake of embellishment."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I'm glad I had the opportunity to play it before I bought it, because I can sum it up very basically with one sentence:

KD:M is not what it is pretending to be.  

To expound, the miniatures are complex, beautiful, and very evocative of the theme.  The rule book is practically an artbook with rules scattered between full-page illustrations. There are cards....hundreds and hundreds of cards.  These all sound like positives, and they are...BUT...

...this isn't really a particularly innovative board game.  It is a miniatures game.  Yes, there is a campaign.  Yes, there is a narrative of sorts.  But at the end of the day, the biggest parts of the "game" are desperate, odds-against-winning dicefests with minimal tactical decisions besides attacking with your best weapon and hoping for 9's and 10's on a d10.  

So, for a miniatures game, it is probably a great hobby-type activity, but really isn't any more developed (probably less so) than a tactics-level skirmish game like Warhammer.  As a roleplaying game, there isn't much of a story to follow besides "hunt, kill, survive?, tables/cards for events."  And as a board game, it is basically an unnecessarily fiddly and difficult variant of Descent with a lower variety of miniatures. 

That said, I don't hate it.  I understand what they were going for.  It just isn't for me.  Just know what you're getting into before you buy it.  You might save yourself a whole lot of time and money.

My Husband introduced me to this game. There simply isn't another board game like this that I've seen. I can't help but think any low ratings are from trolls or idiots. Sure, there's a lot going on in Kingdom Death. Sure, its expensive. Sure, its adult themed. None of those thing warrant a negatively critical and ludicrously low evaluation of the game play or dynamic. I would never rate a game I don't understand or know anything about, but there are certainly some Gamers without scruples

 Regardless, Kingdom Death: Monster  is currently the King in my board game collection. It has great art, excellent models and an engaging and layers dynamic. The only 10 I'm comfortable giving at this time..

KS. I've been looking for tabletop X-COM for years. A game that blends tactical combat with strategic resource management, with both aspects being equally important (as opposed to the common setup of campaign systems that are only there to support the tactical focus). Ironically, XCOM wasn't my X-COM. What it does it seems to do pretty well, but it's not what I'm after.

Kingdom Death is it, or at least as close to it as I've ever seen.

I only gave the first Kickstarter a brief look and dismissed it as just more oversexualised T&A minis. No actual chainmail bikinis, but the same sensibility. Needless to say I now regret that.

Once the game escaped into the wild I picked up on it by word of mouth. Read and watched every review I could find. Watched early lantern year sessions on youtube and twitch (mostly avoiding mid to late game for fear of spoilers). And started saving for KS2.

This game is a work of mad genius art.

I love minis. I've been collecting and playing with them in one form or another since Heroquest. These are some of the best minis I've ever handled, and only getting better with the newer narrative sculpts. But that's just a bonus. It's the game that I love. I'd happily play it with lego figures, meeples or even standees.

My feelings about this game are complex. On one level, I find the entire package - the theme, the art, the phases of play, the graphic design, entirely refreshing and unique. On the other hand, it's grotesque, gratuitous, and dark. Yet, I still give this an 8. As a package, it's damn impressive. I'm just not sure it's a world I care to revisit. I'd give this game about equal chances for never playing it again and buying it for a full run through. Only time will tell.

I'll summarize the experience for you:
Work hard to gain survival: cannot spend survival due to random disorder.
Work hard to gain resources: lose all stored resources due to random settlement event.
Work hard to build survivors: lose survivors due to random dice roll.
Work hard to build equipement: lose equipement due to random disorder or hit location card draw.

The only word that can summarize this thing is: bullshit.

Update 4: Downgraded to 3. After 21 sessions, everything about the game screams unfinished and lack of professionalism. From the horrendous bottom of the insert that makes cards jump off from it, to the way there's gaps everywhere on the assembled minis.
You basically cannot play the game if you are unlucky: you'll lose survival all the time (therefore not being able to do much in the showdown), draw disorders that prevent you from using weapons or fighting art (making survivors useless), draw the same settlement event over and over, killing off all your survivors without any mitigation. Plus the hunts serve only to weaken survivors before the showdown, further enforcing the frustration.
TPKs are extremely punishing in that you lose a LY, have no possibility of innovating or crafting, depending on your Death principle, therefore making it more likely that you'll suffer a TPK in the future, further enforcing the death spiral.
Once again, great idea, terrible execution.

Update 3: Great system but terrible implementation due to the settlement and survivor sheets, the fiddlyness of gear, disorder, and fighting art cards, and the randomness of just about everything, that leads to spending a lot of time annotating stuff that will be irrelevant 1 minute later, leading to a pure waste of time.
Set up and tear down time are too long to justify sessions that end up in TPK or straight gear/resource loss with no gain at all.
I just skip nemesis encounters and substract 4 population from my settlement. The end result is the same and the time it takes is saved.
Desperately needs an app.
And that's from someone who hates apps.

Update 2: Tracking stuff is overwhelming solo. Repeating hunts of the same game is getting stale somehow.
Also I have a knack for rolling terrible results it seems. Especially when rolling a lantern 10 has negative consequences.
Dropping the rating slightly.

Updated after 1 rebooted campaign: this thing is just insane. I need more lion testes!
I'm extremely impressed with the overall quality of the product. And it's fun to play. Constant referring to the severe injury table is a little annoying and i'm surprised by the lack of companion app, but, just, like... Wow.

Yet to play, but impressed by the quality of the cards. I love the card backs, the overall design of the cards and the artwork from the tiles and rulebook. The tiles are impressively thick and big. I had never seen so big a punchboard either.
The rulebook's pages are a bit too thin though but otherwise, very nice attention to detail.
I intend to play this without the minis at first and to proxy them using either standees or Dark Souls' minis (this thing has to be used for something hasn't it?) and if I enjoy the game I'll try and magnetize and paint the minis if I ever find the courage to do so (so probably never.)

Lots of dice rolling and very little player agency.   "Playing" KDM means being the game's book-keeper as it plays itself.   Roll a die, get told what happens and cross index the result against the results of previous die rolls.
   
Let's make something absolutely clear: when the game tells me to draw a random card, which tells me to roll a die, which then points at a reference table that claims I have achieved/failed something, then *I* have not actually achieved/failed anything.   I haven't even participated.

Very pretty though.

Update: The combat focus seems to be based around monster deck manipulation if you want to be successful.  I feel this slows the game down, takes away from the excitement of combat and isn't thematic...  The game is still great but I wish this was modified from "look at next 3 cards and rearrange" to "have the option of discarding the next 1 card drawn" or something similar.

KDM leaves a lasting impression and even though I wish the settlement and hunt phases had more control based on choices and acquired skills, it is a masterpiece.  Don't own it but probably will at some point.

Watched the prologue on Yuotube a few times but didn't think too much of it.  Finally played it and a few lantern years and this game is quite immersive and so well done.

Just played once, but very much looking forward to daily sessions. May modify my score up or down as I learn more about the game. But so far---a glorious bloodbath! I haven't played enough to know how much I like the combat system, but so far it is very visceral. And the miniatures are beautiful. A friend reported some annoyance with the way the plastic fits (or doesn't) together. Perhaps we should have gone full resin . . .
**
Ok, we've played about 6 sessions of this game, totaling approximately 30 hours of gameplay.  I'm fully engaged. Every session is full of tension, despair, and cheers of triumph. Every phase of the game is fun. This machine is hitting on all cylinders. In the last session, our settlement was WIPED OUT and we had to start all over from the beginning---and we did, happily. The ONLY reason you might avoid this game is if you hate putting miniatures together. Even in that case, I'd say find a friend who will do it for you.

1. Do the bases that come loose in the bag. No assembly required and easy to paint.

2. The Gold Smoke Knight's base is also easy to assemble -- just cut it from the sprue. Go paint that.

3. The King's Man has only one sprue, and its sprue only has the King's Man miniature. So it's pretty easy to keep track of which bit on the sprue belongs to which miniature. It also doesn't have a bazillion different teeny-tiny customizable bits to confuse you.

I'm messing around with plain old white glue to assemble other plastic miniatures and so far, it's been working. Haven't used it on KDM, but if it doesn't work, I can always try another glue.

KDM has some cool features: the models, the artwork, the snippets of story and flavour you get. During the first few sessions, the flavour is great, and you get excited making characters, founding your town and seeing what happens. After a while, however, this starts to fade, leaving the core mechanics to hold the game together.

These core mechanics consist of about a half-hour of arranging equipment (this becomes more of a problem with a variable group, or with lots of character death), about a half-hour of rolling dice during the hunt (hoping you reach the fight without dying or being seriously disabled), about an hour of fighting (which is pretty good as a strategy exercise, but again random wounds can be instantly lethal), and then about an hour of figuring out what to do with your resources (after seeing who randomly dies when you get home).

KDM is often praised for its brutality, but this is where the game falls apart for me. While I really appreciate the value of risk and major consequences, it needs to be meaningful to work. Unfortunately, KDM substitutes out meaningful player decisions for random, flavourful outcomes. Too many random events are simply "roll or die", instead of "take no risk and a penalty, or a great (potentially lethal) risk for a reward. Too many times does half the party die arbitrarily during the hunt before the showdown, and have to sit out for the next hour.

My main problem with the game is that it lacks agency. When my characters die, I want to know that I could have made a choice to avoid it. Instead, the game makes most of the significant decisions for you. It's satisfying when a character struggles through a difficult fight, battered, broken and bleeding, defeating the foe that slew all of their allies to protect the village. It's less satisfying when they finally reach home, victorious, and the random settlement event is "roll or die" (or even "straight-up kill your longest-surviving character, then roll or die for another").

The game does play differently solo; nobody has to sit out, and the party benefits through being able to make optimal gear decisions, rather than trying to give everyone bits and pieces fairly. The solo game is primarly one of optimising combat tactics and optimising resource usage; a bit more of a puzzle to solve. It still suffers from lack of agency, but you can handwave it more easily and ignore events.

Overall, KDM is okay, and enjoyable for a few sessions. I would enjoy it more if it was designed to threaten and pose risks, rather than kill arbitrarily. As it stands, there's a small degree of "you could have avoided this" and a huge degree of "lol you're dead".

I love the theme and no other game has given me such an RPG feel in a board game box (I wanted dungeon crawlers like Descent to do so, but they didn't).

You certainly feel at the mercy of the dice early on and some random events seem overly harsh, but I chalk that up to the theme.  Like an RPG you start weak and really feel yourself start to grow over time. 

*After failing 1 campaign and being halfway through another I'm bumping this up to a 9.  It gets pretty damn good.
*3 campaigns done...still excited to try some of the variants out.

Sometimes I get this idea in my head that I'm an ameritrasher--have to be, right? I mean, I find euros ok but often soulless, and the players not intense or trash-talky enough, I like dice and love drama, & eat up multiplayer politics and manipulation...

but then a godawful game like this comes along and I realize that I find much of the core ameritrash truly, deeply, tedious--few meaningful decisions, extreme over-reliance on dice instead of innovative mechanics for drama, force-fed 'narrative' read off random cards/charts instead of allowed to naturally develop through play, a fetishistic relationship to minis and other game components...

Where does that leave me? Maybe I'm a wargamer...

great game, if you like dice crapshoots, 'drama' that comes in the form of random number charts, little ability to affect the game strategically, disgusting stories, way too much time spent activities that are not gaming, and forming unnatural relationships with bits of plastic shaped like boobies. Happily did not finish my 1 play of this foolishness. Even more happily, do not own.

My least favorite part of playing tabletop RPGs is getting into combat and this game is pretty much everything I dislike about common RPG combat systems. The whole settlement building thing is cool, and the theme is great, but I just find the combat way too boring and dragged out for my tastes.

This game lived up to the hype Ive had for it for the past year! Im very much into story based games, I also enjoy the Monster Hunter video games, and this is like those games but with a better, more intriguing setting and story and a Settlement Building mechanic. The second the White Lion grabbed one of our team mates and pulled him away from the group (after wrecking me of course lol) I was like "this game is awesome", the AI deck for the monsters was basically everything I wanted from the Dark Souls board game without the boring hours long grind beforehand. I cant wait to play more and dive deeper into this story and build more of my settlement up!

It is the only game that my group has played since I received it except for short filler games at the end of the night.  The miniature quality is incredible.  The component quality is very good.  The game is incredibly easy to learn but brutally difficult and unforgiving.  All my group wants to do is play more.  We can't wait for the expansions to arrive in 2018.

This game makes one hell of a good first impression, and things only get better with each passing hour you play.  Yeah, this isn't going to be a perfect game for everyone, but for me this is an Ameritrash work of art.  Set aside the mostly deluxe components and you are left with a wonderfully entertaining tactical RPG game system.  This is my solo lifestyle game.

I had previously given this game (on it's own) a 6/10. I now can gladly give it an 8/10. The game plays much better with new more balanced choices, more interesting events, and less reliance on single superpowerful characters who you make immortal (no matter what the cost.)

Instead everyone is replaceable and death seems like and inevitablilty. The final boss doesn't look like a he will job out as hard as the Watcher did. The game just feels better than KDM 1.4, and I am really looking forwards to playing it more.

People Claim it is the best game ever made, and it is easy to see why they would say so.  This is a fantastic game.  I myself would be tempted to call it such, but I would classify it as ONE of the best games created.  If you are looking for a lighthearted adventure, this is not the game to fill that space.  This is why it is great that other games exist, we can have more than one.

If you have the money and the time to play this game several times, it is worth every penny.

Found randomly after seeing its artwork. Fell in love with the artwork and started scouring for information about the game. Literally every type of game i have wanted. Asked Poots directly when i could order it since i missed KS by 2 years. Waited patiently and ordered it instantly before GenCon.

GenCon only made my decision more solid. Gameplay looks fun, characters interesting, items rediculous, and not to mention the shear amount of content.

Will re-evaluate when i get my hands on it this October.

I'd actually rate KD:M a 9.5, but that extra 1/2 point is to somehow compensate the usual absurd hater ratings which plague the bgg. Having said that, KD:M is not perfect (thus the 9.5/10), but it has provided the best boardgaming experience I have ever had. It blends an impressive number of mechanisms and theme so seamlessly that the game's in-depth is amazing, yet not too complicated to learn. Mix a Hardcore unforgiving nightmarish survival theme + Great tactical combat (layers of mechanisms make it as good a it gets) + settlement development / resource management (best part of the game for many people) + the more abstracted hunt phase (probably the weakest in the game, and it could be improved significantly) + A great theme with branching (or should I say net-shaped?) stories which provide immersion and most of the times have an actual effect on the gameplay (not being just an overlying story just for flavour) + some of the best minis out there (assembly is actually fun and I wish I knew how to paint) + tons of variables which provide great replayability + a huge amount of extra content via expansions + plays great solo and in a group of up to 4 (5-6 variant doesn't work well though)= best. game. ever. hands down.  If you think you will like the above, don't miss the reprint KS campaign starting November 25th 2016.

Now my #1 board game of all time. It's a thoroughly addicting mix of board, roleplaying, and miniatures game. What pushes it to #1 for me is the strong narrative that emerges from both the moment-to-moment gameplay and the strategic choices that have dramatic consequences. The dramatic failures can be as fun as the successes.

This game has really replaced all of my others.  I'm always excited to play it, and have driven to the other end of the state to meet up with people who were interested in seeing it!

I was hooked by this game from the moment I saw it trending on Kickstarter four years ago - the minis were gorgeous and horrifying, and although I had never really been a big board game fan before, I knew I had to check it out.  I was on a big Dark Souls kick at the time, and the bleak, hopeless setting spoke to the same parts of me that DS did.  I backed it for the core game and a good number of expansions, and I'm glad I did!  When it came (several years and apartments later), the work that had gone into every inch of it was incredible.  It is palpably Adam Poots' dream project through and through.  If there was an inch of it that wasn't going to be top-quality, it didn't end up in the box. (I am lamenting the Lantern festival expansion cancellation, but he wasn't happy with it, so that is what it is).
The minis were all beautiful and, as someone who had zero experience building them, pretty easy to assemble!  With a few exceptions (Looking at you Phoenix and Lonely Tree), it was easy to figure out what went where, and all you needed were some clippers, plastic cement and a hobby knife.  I'm a little too intimidated to paint them.
I made a few new aquaintences on various social media websites who were local and wanted to check the game out -  I've made a bunch of new friends, and let me tell you, getting eaten by lions together is a great way to start a friendship.  The game is by no means easy to transport, with minis that don't fit back into the container once assembled and a box the size and weight of a child's coffin, but I have been carting it around to boardgame cafes and friends houses regardless.   
I love that in the game, you're playing as a society and the individual survivors are as much a resource as the bones and hide you gather from slain monsters.  It gets easier if you don't get too attached.  All of the monsters are extremely challenging to conquer, and the game is as much in mitigating risks as it is swinging axes.  The randomness of dice rolling seems cruel at first, until I realized that.  
I remember feeling that same rush and feeling of accomplishment I got killing The Butcher Nemesis as I did from beating Orenstein and smaugh, and wearing Screaming Antelope pelts into battle has thay same primal vibe I loved from Monster Hunter!   

I also enjoy the dark humor the game is rich in - My favorite random hunt event (spoiler) has the party wander into a plane of stone feet instead of stone faces - insane survivors surmise that they must have reached the underside of the worls and hold on for dear life while sane ones can wander onwards - if the whole party is insane, though, they of course fall off the bottom of the world.

I've logged hundreds of hours across various campaigns since the 1st kickstarter released.  I went back into the 2nd kickstarter for the upgrade pack plus everything new.  This will be one of my "own it all" collectables for the foreseeable future.

It's the best civilization building game I've ever played.  The story is immersive and it captures dread in a way no other board game does.  It's also the only game I've ever played solo across multiple sessions.  I much prefer solo play to playing with a group.

This is my perfect game. Some people don't like the civ building and micromanagement that comes with playing this, but it's what makes this game exceptional to me. As an avid RPG player the customization this game offers is also supremely important in my enjoyment of this game, and what makes it completely stand-a-lone in the realm of RPG-lite games. 

In terms of difficulty and randomness in the game, the better you are at the game the better you do, which is how you can tell the difference between a brutally unfair game where the challenge exists in the randomness, v. a brutally difficult game where the challenge exists in the elements of design. There are times where you get shit on out of sheer randomness, but you can prepare for and still do well a lot despite these happenstances. 

Anytime anyone even suggests this game I'm down to play it with them, even after dozens of hours of game play behind me. There are, so far, no other games in my collection that fit that definition.

This game isn't going to appeal to everyone but for some it's going to almost become a lifestyle game in the way that Warhammer 40k does for others. You have some modeling, some of the best quality minis in board games and a great game. The game itself will appeal to those of us that enjoy seeing a story unfold in campaign style. Important decisions and choices need to be made throughout and you will have many characters die if you play honestly. Accepting that your heroes will die is a important part of the game so don't get too attached and maybe name them after people that you don't like :)

This is truly an experience, and a grand one it is.  Immersing yourself into the world is a treat and experiencing it from the eyes of the survivors is amazing.  The showdown mechanics are very well done and I love the fantastic moments that can come out of each fight.  Building up a settlement can be a little challenging logically with all the cards and options but in the end, a satisfying experience.  I can highly recommend KDM.

RATING: 7
A surprisingly very solid and complete game that is worth the heavy time investment required to progress and develop the settlement. The theme is a little (actually, very) dark and dismal, and I often feel a severe sense of hopelessness when playing, but hey, it's called Kingdom Death for a reason! My group really enjoy the RPG elements of player and settlement progression, and the story arcs keep the players invested. This game is not a walk in the park, and I sense that there is no happy ending, but something about human nature keeps us wanting to try and try again in the vain hope that our downtrodden little survivors might actually survive. 

The game system is quite clever. No DM is needed due to the specialised AI and hit location decks. Combat is intuitive and interesting. 

I think, if your group enjoys RPGs, then they may very well enjoy Kingdom Death. It's a long term investment kind of a game and you'll really feel a sense of achievement as your settlement gradually upgrades and develops new weaponry, buildings and bonuses.

I won a copy of this game through one of the BGG quiz contests.  The game was on my radar already because I frequent Kickstarter and it got a lot of buzz for the amount of money this project raised.  If not for winning the contest though I may have never played this game, it is not something I would even call a board game.  It isn't marketed or geared towards boardgamers, which is what I am, and in that vein it is a big miss for me.

The game is prohibitively expensive for a board game.  For miniature gamers perhaps this is not the case but this game tries to merge those two worlds and at least from a boardgamers perspective I have very little interest in  the building and painting of admittedly EXTREMELY high quality miniatures, I'm interested in the game I get to play with them and there are very few games I want to spend that exorbitant an amount of money on.

But I won the game so the amount of money I spent for it is 0 so why the complaint...For me it is lack of content.  The gameplay isn't bad,  it is almost RPG combat where you roll dice to overcome defensive values and the AI deck that controls the enemies is nice.  The settlement phase is a neat addition and I like the idea of harvesting enemies for the materials to make new equipment.  But you don't get many scenarios to play or enemies to fight in this basic game box.  For the price most people have to pay you have to really REALLY be in love with the miniatures for that.  And I'm not going to pay the cost of the expansion content when I'm not that interested in the miniatures to play more.  This reminds me so much of Myth, another Kickstarter juggernaut, that seemed to be selling their miniatures with a poorly planned game behind it.

As for the game component quality.  While the art and the miniature are very high quality they are very off-putting.  I don't mind the nudity and sexual content, I like being titillated, I bought a terrible game called Lap Dance after all.  It's the more gruesome elements that have me not wanting to look at it...which is the antithesis of your goal when your artwork or miniature quality is this beautiful.  I'm baffled that they included such high quality miniatures and then such poor quality cardboard tokens in the box.  If you are going to have this kind of quality and price tag for a game those tokens should be made of a material besides cardboard.

I just think this game misses the mark among a board game crowd.  I wouldn't buy this game most of the time or have a reason to write these comments.  But I did have a copy and  tried it and those are my opinions based on my perspective as a gamer.  You need to keep me interested in a game in ways besides gluing and painting plastic.

My group and I have put in over 50+ hours over the course of a few weeks. It is unlike any other board game we've played. 

The game requires a lot of space and optimally you will want to just leave it sitting on your table if possible. Set up and putting it away is a lot to handle.

BUT HOLY CRAP it is a perfect story driven cooperative monster hunting settlement building masterpiece that is sure to influence the board gaming culture. If you're looking for a massive in-depth rpg experience to bond with friends over or even play solo, then this is the game for you.

I love this game. It is completely and unapologetically brutal and unfair,  but it is supposed to be. Life in Kingdom Death is obviously not going to be easy... or long, most likely. It's right there in the title. But the feelings of hope, helplessness, anger, loss, surprise, joy, and relief this game evokes is amazing. Discovering the next huge innovation that will do wonders for your settlement, or the next horrible event to befall your survivors is an amazing thing and you can't help but be invested in their tiny, doomed, little lives. It's a wholly unique board game experience. The closest you can get is in videogames.  Just amazing, but certainly not for everyone.

This must be the first board game that sucked me into a "just one more turn" loop. That is especially astounding considering that one full turn (hunt, showdown & settlement phase) takes almost two hours. 

It seems that I am addicted to this monster of a game. This (mostly) masterfully crafted game. This wonderful, immense, astonishing and overwhelming game.

This game is definitely not flawless (therefore no 10 rank), but it is such an experience to play. It is hard to describe this, because all this wonder and excitement doesn't come from one or two easily indentifiable elements of the game, but rather its (mostly) coherent whole and the sublte combination of its individual parts. And the few parts that are actually bothersome can be patched with a few well placed house rules (if you are willing to do so).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Dark and brutal game, but very intricately done, almost too much so. It's true when people say that the learning curve is steep, that you shouldn't get attached to your characters, and that you are bound to forget rules while playing. After about 15 hours of this, I needed to pack it away for a bit and play something lighter. It's psychologically challenging.

RATING: 5
I'm sure this game is better than a 5, but considering the way the mini's come cut into tiny pieces that need to be assembled, I may never actually play this game.  For $250 I'd expect for more modern methods of mini delivery.  I'm very disappointed in my purchase at this point.  I'll revisit in a few weeks to see if I feel it's worth the time I don't have to even get ready to play this game.

I really wish this game was available without having to buy the miniatures. The battle mechanics are very enjoyable, the world is weird and sometimes irreverently hilarious, and the level-up aspect keeps you driven. I'm not into miniatures, so that side of it just drives the price up. I would have been happy with cardboard stand-ups. But I guess I can't complain if my cousin is buying it.

1.5 KICKSTARTER along with multiple expansions. Will be receiving content until at least 2019. Great KS experience. Excited to finally get my copy of the game.

Update: I have my core game, have played through my first campaign to total settlement death. Made it 6 Lantern years in before losing. Here are my thoughts.

Kingdom Death is the most complete gaming experience I've ever had. Being a fan of horror and fantasy themed games plays only a small portion of justifying my high rating, it's how the theme and game play are executed that propels this game to the status of "Best Game" in my collection. 

The experience is story driven, where the story goes and how it all plays out is totally random and changes constantly. The fighting of monsters is a large part of the game, but only covers a third of what is really happening in a single gaming session. You hunt and become hunted as you try and build your own civilization and settlement. Disease, child birth, new survivors, death, language development and a plethora of other events all can be experienced during a campaign. How you adapt and create and survive is all a part of how you approach how you will win the game. 

Kingdom Death is brilliance in a massive and initially overwhelming collection of materials inside the game box. It takes time to organize and sort it all out, and of course there is the building of the minis needed for the game. This is a turn off for some, but for those who don't mind or take pride in building their game pieces, it simply adds to the experience. 

Justifying giving this game a 10 comes in the fact that when I am not playing it, I want to be. When I am playing it I'm not only having a blast playing solo (have yet to play with anyone else) but I am also thinking about what I could do differently the next time I play when I start running into trouble vs the game. I've never had a game like this before. I've owned well over 250 games and expansions and this is my only 10 I've ever given out. 

To me it's perfect.

Kickstarter. Cooperative horror game for 1-4 players. Complex rules and a steep learning curve. I suspect I will only play this solo. If I ever find someone willing to play with me, I will almost certainly become the "Alpha Player" and dictate all actions in the game. That's frustrating both for me and the others. The game is hard. Really hard. Lots of random cards drawn and lots of dice rolled. Too much is random. And the outcome is quite often instant death for a character, without anything you can do about it. Extremely frustrating. It seems almost impossible to complete the game. And even if some extreme luck should bring victory in the final showdown it's gonna take hundreds of hours to get there. It'll never happen. It has nice miniatures but why must I glue them together myself? I'm not very skilled as a miniature builder and the results are "acceptable" at best. And why the juvenile sexist design? So I don't like this game at all. Normally I don't consider price a factor when I rate my games. But when a game costs this much it has to be considered. It's the most expensive game I've ever bought. I'm so sorry, but put it all together and it's the worst thing I have in my collection. Rating it as 1.

Edit: I've added a few house rules to remove some of the worst frustrations with this game. It's playable now. But it still happens that you send four characters on a hunt. After several hours of fighting two of them return carrying some "Love Juice" they've recovered - only to roll a "1" on the intimacy table, instantly killing them both. Where's the strategy in this? Is it fun with a game that works this way? Way too random for me! Rating stays at 2, and will probably never rise any higher.

I'm still not 100% sure. I did enjoy building the mini's a lot. The game itself seems like it might be too hard and too brutal though. Settlement events are terrible for you, hunt events are terrible for you, showdown with first nemesis is very hard (that's as far as we've played so far) and your characters can die at the drop of a hat at any given moment. Example, hunt event, if any survivor has 'noisy' on an item card, they die... I'll continue the review once I've played more. 

I do like it, but it's maybe too hard.

Having played to lantern year 11-12 now, the game has gotten a bit easier for us now that our gear is starting to come together and learning how to play more strategically, it is still however a very unforgiving game. You really need to understand that your survivors are just rescuers, the same as any weapon or armour you build. Once you get around that fact, them dying doesn't hurt you as much.  

Bumped up my rating from 8 to 9. All I want to do right now is play this game for days. Unfortunately I only get to once every 2 weeks at the moment. Really enjoying myself.

If I was a professional reviewer, I would be sitting in stunned silence, desperately scrambling my brain to think of something more profound than "Believe the Hype."

As it stands, I'm too busy playing this game to possibly find time for something like that.

I joined BGG because of this game, and found dozens and dozens of games to play, and when it all came back to it, it was better than any of them.

I originally kickstartered this but backed-out before it completed.  The main reason I backed out was both because the community was being quite hostile "your with us or against us" and the grotesqueness of the miniatures.  The theme I was ok with at first, despite not being a huge horror fan, because it has strong fantasy elements.  

I have seen more and more grotesque miniatures, and it is hilarious to me that it is a horror game despite scantily clad female figures that are pristine of body as if they were sculpted/photoshopped.  The "horror" I guess comes in because there are tongues licking their bodies and one wearing a genital dress?  Like look, I understand games push female armor, form, etc to appeal to a male audience, but even as a male this is pushing it too far for a board game.

I played this game some on tabletop simulator, and our battle with the Lion drug on and on with poor dice rolls, it got extremely old, and after 2 nights of playing we still hadn't defeated the thing.  I also got a vibe of extreme randomness where success could easily result in failure, it reminded me a lot of Dungeon Quest, except that game is 30 minutes with a tasteful theme.  you don't need a game this elaborate and expensive for fun fantasy randomness.

I understand we will go on the hunt for other creatures and have a chance to trigger events/go into town but seriously, since combat is at least 50% of this game I would think it should be enjoyable, and it really isn't in my opinion.  The shuffling of cards for AI and wound seems very unnecessary. There are almost too many modifiers and stats to keep track of, this isn't a full fledged RPG here.

Overall there is good miniature art here, despite the theme/content.  Some of the most unique miniatures like the flower knight have come from these guys, and no one can deny the artwork in the game is impressive.  I also will give them credit for some of the ideas and the immense amount of work they went into here, it is seriously impressive.  I just can't help feel like they squandered it all with a subpar combat system and a disturbed 15 year old boy take on the design of the art/miniatures.  Overall, very disappointed for such an elaborate game, but I can't rate it horribly because of the work they put in so I am compromising with a meh rating.

If the game was a short and simple 30 minute game I might be willing to play it, but given it is Mage Knight complex and multiple games long, I am not interested, so glad I didn't drop 250 on this.

The Good: Interesting AI, campaign ideas.

The Bad: Too expensive!!!  Over-produced, overly complex, tedious, dragging gameplay, too many mechanics and details  Ambiguous rules without enough examples of play.

The game does not flow because it bogs down into excessive detail.  This is overly brutal, punishing game where hours of play can be extinguished with a few bad die rolls/card draws.  It seems like there are good ideas with Kingdom Death, but was not really playtested and tightened.  It's kinda like a kitchen sink approach to a dungeon crawler.  If some generous soul gave this game to me for free, I would still not play it again.

We played a campaing for a whole weekend and it was awesome. The world is bizzare to say at least but it's dark, nihilistic and (let's be hones) overly sexualized themes are creating a disturbing adult horror mix that somehow works. Both boss fights, hunting and village upgrading are done great. The only downside for me are miniatures. Don't get me wrong, they're awesome but I'm not a guy who could put them together. Overall it's a great game for people who like the vibe of a dark fantasy. Definitely not for children!

Everything about this game is beautiful:
 - the material components are mind-blowing. Best minis I've ever seen, bar none, but many of the game components are just flawless.
 - There is surprisingly subtle and elegant tension in many different areas of the game. Your first couple lantern years especially see you exult over each new piece of gear and innovation, while still hungering for getting more done before the darkness starts closing in.
 - The setting and theme just ooze out of every part of gameplay, from the physical components, the play itself, and the hunt, story, and settlement events. The strength of emergent narrative is a fantastic capstone to the game mechanics.

This game has problems - it's got a nasty learning curve, with lots of bity rules that can slow you down and leave you flicking through the rulebook, So I had to dock it a half star for that. 
That said, it's damn amazing. Beautiful, dripping with theme and narrative, and the combat system is genuinely brilliant. The way the AI and Hit Location decks work makes every showdown very different and really conveys a sense of personality that makes fights incredibly varied, keeping the game fresh, but also thematic. Enemies also have different levels that make them not only more dangerous but a little different - you have to relearn how to fight them.
The campaign system and variety within the box give it incredible longevity, which helps to justify a massive price tag. Expansions add even more variety (for when those seven different enemies aren't enough) and some even offer entire variant campaigns. 
A fantastic game.

Kickstartered the 1.5 Version and was not disapointed. It is a very good game with a lot of good mechanics and a realy nice artwork. The price is a little pain in the ass but i couldn´t resist. Every round is a big luck driven nightmare, and is a lot of fun until the dice are beginning to play against you. 
For myself it is a good game, i will play it alot with my wife, but everything depends to much on luck and so only 8 Points, and the decision that gloomhaven is a lot more interessting and strategic as KDM.

Absolutely loving playing this game in our group. Currently meeting twice a month to play through it. It will need several playthroughs for us to starting playing better, but the journey is as important as the end game.

Great narrative, where winning or losing isn't as important as creating your settlement's story. Incredible that the narrative emerges through the mechanics and doesn't feel forced.

Not a perfect game, but very close.

Pros: The roller coaster of a narrative this game produces is interesting and tense. The survival of your settlement feels grim. There's danger lurking around every corner. The settlement development is interesting and the gear crafting system is solid.
Cons: This game is very random (lots of unmodified dice rolling) and has some rules issues when trying to figure out how some uncommon situations or effects should be resolved. People live and die by the die and some battles can be lost just on poor luck alone.

Kingdom Death: Monster was so close to being the perfect game I was looking for. The hunt is absolutely brilliant, and I don't think any game comes close to how well it is handled. I love the unique AI decks, making each encounter fresh and terrifying as we best try to defend ourselves while gathering information on how to handle our new opponent. The would deck is also a genius concept and brings the theme of fighting a monster to life. Although I enjoy the concept of the city life, especially the event cards, many events had consequences that felt completely out of place, instakilling villagers due to poor dice rolls. Although a few had perks, they were far too little, and I wish there were some way to make them easier to achieve through anything other than a dice roll. This is also where the Hunt completely falls flat, especially after fighting stronger enemies beyond the darkness. Having a chance to instantly lose a villager before the fight is an absolutely ridiculous concept and it really took away from my enjoyment of the game. It's quite unfortunate really. I love the combat and certain aspects of the town management, but too many luck-reliant factors and the frequency of instant-kill events will always serve as a barrier preventing me from buying the game.

Yes, it's brutal and a large part of the game is mitigating disaster, but it's a game where decisions made in one year will have ramifications far down the road, so will keep you constantly trying to make the best decision and second guessing it no matter what you choose.

I rally don´t know why everybody here is so overwhelming excited about this game and everyone shows only the first tutorial fight? 
I waited years to get my copy and i was so curious about our first game!

You will understand my deep disappointment after a few explanations:

1. Ok, the artwork and miniatures are great... Thats why i didn´t only gave it 1 point of raiting!
2. Why make a dungeon crawler / horror / surrvival game and only put heroes in the core box? There are only 5 different monsters in the box and over 20 survivors... after fighting the lion the third time it´s just annoying!
3. Balancing - There is just no balancing... You can die in the tutorial and it says: "Just start again and agin"
4. Settlement - Nice idea and good made, but absolut useless to define 30 - 45 Min. to craft your charakters when there are action cards in the game that say: "Roll a d10 on a 1 your charakter is just dead!"
5. The monter fights are epic, genius...? I can´t understand this comments??? You allways place monster in the middle and survivors arround and roll dice until one fraction dies. The first 10 times it´s cool, but nothing on it is new or tactial.
6. Why make 1.000 gear cards??? You have to write down what all of your charaktes have, if you end a session and on the next you have to recreate the charakter sheets. Why not just make a list of gear, without cards, and just write the items / skills direct on the charakter sheet? - We did after third session... don´t the the cards!?
7. Like the campaign on kickstarter the only goal of the core game is for you to buy more expansions to make it better. That´s not what you have promissed us Adam!
8. Really 400 dollar??? You can buy descent second edition für 60 dollar. There are more monsters, more scenarios and better gameplay in it!

I could go on like that, but i hope you understand my frustration after playing the first sessions.

But for alle those, who don´t give anything about balancing, tactics, RPG-Elements and stuff that makes most survival games great is Kingdom Death Monster the best choice! Just let all of them die, ever and ever again.

Combat and AI were well done and interesting, but nothing amazing.

Mini's are well done, though if I was the one putting them together and painting...I would be super daunted.

What I enjoy most was the Settlement aspect.  Building a tribe, with innovation "tech tree's" and the moral aspect that will define an ongoing aspect of all new comers.  Shared information for the betterment of the groups survival.  The ability to take various settlement survivors out for hunts, enabling you to progress a little slower, in favor of not getting too attached to a single character.

Very well done, with enough unique going for it to justify the hype.  The "toys" associated with it are just pretty frosting, not necessary, but so glad they are.

Wow. I mean... WOW. This game is so brutal. Rulebook is beautiful, arts are awesome, nearly everything is high quality. Board game experience like no other. Lots of lore, and that theme - you'll love it if you like dark places.

Few con is that it can take some time to setup between phases, lots of downtime between them (setting decks, boards with cards, and other). Also some rules are broken (looping monster actions and therefore getting inifinite skills / party getting wipe out which u cant respond to in any way - those loops should get errata).

Except that its perfect game with gameplay and feeling like no other game. 

I give it "WOW, I F*CKING LOVE IT Badge!"

This is it. My Holy Grail! Much like War of the Ring Collector's Edition this is a beast in terms of content quality and quantity. The gameplay is solid and so far seems really well balanced but skewed towards difficulty. In terms of the game's spirit it seems heavily inspired by the Demon Souls / Dark Souls video games. Both in terms of harsh gameplay outlook as well as the mysterious and gruesomeness of the setting. In essence this is a boss monster rush game with some light RPG elements. Progression is mostly through equipment as you can never count on your stat levelled survivors to well, survive. The element this game really shines is the emergent narrative built into the randomness of the events. This adds massive amounts of immersion and replayability to the title.

So far we have the Kickstarter core game, as well as some (non-essential) miniature expansions. I simply can't wait what the actual expansions coming in 2016 will bring to the game. I am really looking forward to all the crazy ideas in Poots' head being realized as this franchise matures. I sure hope that this Kingdom will have a bright and content rich future.

Even though KD:M is definitely a niche title with a for some prohibitively hefty price tag both in cash and time investment to assemble and paint the miniatures, I think this game brings so much wonder and innovation to our tables that its a real travesty that it has been all but ignored by the established game review community. KD:M is fresh, richly thematic and even though it is pricey is nowhere as soul-suckingly cash draining as the recent FFG releases. This is Kickstarter at its finest. I don't expect an established game company producing anything like this. It is unique, ridiculously grande in vision and you can feel just how much this has been a labor of love for its creator.

Game is hard to label. Its divided in 3 parts:

1) the hunt: a sequence of events you have to deal with to reach your enemy
2) The showdown: the actual fight
3) The settlement phase: the longest one where you manage and develop your village.

All of that in about 90 minutes :)

Basically you have this huge event book that makes your game always different and you are in constant fear of what's about to happen.

Its a story that builds itself each time in wich you have to make harsh choices and deal with fate.
---------------------
Back to what people wants to know.
Games is extremely dice/card centered in the tutorial but as you develop your village you get the tools to manipulate dices.

Still the game is extremely difficult and you are expected to fail more than once before managing to even reach endgame.

Pro: 
-Awesome mini
-Awesome art
-Awesome story
-Extreme replayability
-deeply strategic fight (once your village grows)
-civilization part is another game on its own
-everything is TOP quality even the book
-showdown and hunt setups are extrenely fast
-BEST solo game i ever tried
-best hybrid between a boardgame and a paper RPG (without the "acting" part :) ).

Con:
-400$ (content might justify it but almost 40 of the minis are survivors/kits and survivors themselves are basically tokens... in theory 6 would be enough)
-Box has cards inserts but they didn t think to leave space for separators for cards included -.- (can be fixed)
-you are supposed to lose most nemesis first time you encounter them..to win you have to carefully plan each year settlement phase until you meet them. (aka trial and error...some people dislikes it)
-tutorial showdown is tactically and strategically lacking (if you show it to eurogamers all they will see is a dicefest and thus hate the game).
-lot of bookkeeping

Still one of the best games i own.

This game is not something for everybody. It is sometimes unfair, its only for adult players. Out of the blue your people will die. But remember you dont play a person you play the settlement. You will say "unless you roll a 1 your fine" and then the 1 gets rolled. Those things will happen. I am not that big of a fan of random punishment. But I really love this game.
How can this be? Well it makes a good story. small spoilers ahead
I had a survivor that fought a nemesis. This Boss ate her face, blinding her crushing her jaw she turned into a frenzy and delivered the killing blow. She survived. Only to die the next year of the plague. I laughed and got a bit sad, but was also glad to start a new survivor.
You just never know. You have everything under control, the quarry is almost dead and lying on the ground. You stab it, its a trap... it strikes at you, your head gets hit, and explodes in a shower of bone fragments and gore.

After 12 plays I think I have had enough of this game. The theme definitely got to me, and I don't enjoy it. I mostly enjoyed the showdown and always have fun fighting something as a party. I'm not one for such a theme anyway, and eventually I just had enough. Thankfully I played with few friends and used a friend's copy, otherwise I would be bummed at having spent hundreds of dollars on it.

I disagree with the designer on what's 'fun' a lot. I like attachment to individual characters, I don't like the inability to mitigate bad rolls, I don't think the players should have as many mandatory deaths, I think happy endings after a massive investment are a good thing.

But there's so much to love in the game, and so much room to house rule it to fit your ideal gaming experience. Loving playing through it with friends.

this game is so fun I can't wait to play it any chance I get. I think about it in the morning when I wake and wish I could stay up longer to play it at night all of my other games are looking dusty these days.

Mega coop fantasy miniature scenario grid movement featuring heavy dark, grotesque, horror with graphic and mature theme and artwork. Huge rule book unveils the rich story in teasing installments. Some story telling,  Massive amount of special rules. Very difficult challenges will create a Groundhog Day of repeated scenarios as if trapped on a level of Dante's Inferno.  I love how the AI driven encounters slowly reveal the creature's nature and and lethal characteristics. Legacy aspect as you buff your twisted, barely surviving heroes and expand their disturbing and twisted settlements.  Lots of assembly and painting required with a hefty price tag place this out of my collection.

The big, bad, audacious grand campaign game. Many hate its very existence, others love it, as do I. I love the dark art style (and fortunately, my girlfriend does too). The difficulty and harshness of the game are entirely on-theme. But for me, the real heroes of this game are the monsters. Individual AI decks for the different monsters make them all behave very, very differently. No 'this monster does the same as the other one but stronger' here, each monster kills you in an entirely different way. 25 plays in the first month, hoping to get many many more in!

Had a strong urge to find a new co-op game to play that would not need a dedicated DM/GM to coordinate. Took the dive into the 1.5 Kickstarter after reading about it on this site and I am so happy that I made that decision. 

The overall theme, game play, and difficulty made me think about Monster Hunter and Dark Souls. This is one of the major reasons I wanted this game. I just started with my group and we had deaths in the first real fight. With all the events and (horrible) outcomes that occurred, we still had a great time. 

While there is a huge challenge in completing the campaign, I am finding it extremely enjoyable seeing the various (and at times random) events unfold and creating this story and experience (so far).

RATING: 10
I wouldn't give a 10 to a game with inconsistent writing,  unbalanced systems and RNG that can kill your game in the middle of a 20 hours campaign.
Except for this game right here. This game manages to simply crystalize so much good stuff in one spot that the few defaults it sports are simply part of the charm

This game is expensive but it's worth every penny, there's so much content, so much joy in Kingdom Death that I simply cannot lie to myself. This is my favourite game. Ever.

A ton of content, a ton of fun. Fun game and a lot of "miniature hobby" provided in one massive box.

RATING: 8
While there are many excellent and exciting parts to this game, such as the Monster AI and Hit Location decks, overall it suffers from a lack of coherence. In addition, the luck factor often makes it feel like you're less playing and more watching things unfold. So while there is room for improvement, nothing else quite like this exists, and I very much enjoy the crazy ride.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I have a few play sessions under my belt, all solo play, and from this I can say that this is one of my new favorite games. Right away you can feel the weight of your decisions, and how you cope with the horrible things that happens to your settlement and survivors is a major part of crafting a VERY personal experience. My only gripe is one of setup, it takes a large table and it's difficult to play right out of the box, you need to organize the materials. These are obviously minor gripes unrelated to the gameplay.

KD:M is one of the most complete boardgames ever. 99% perfect, but no game for the weak. Be tough and roll high or die. Germany loves Kingdom Death : Monster!

At this moment l have: KD:M 1.5 Base Game, Expansion Dragon King, Sunstalker, Spidicules, Lonely Tree, Slenderman, Lion God and Gorm.

Pre-ordered: all other (All-In-Pledge) Thank you, Adam! Great game!

Purchased Core Game Oct 2015. Own all promos, pinups and expansions with everything sleeved with custom insert so that all game play cards/tokens fit in the original core box.

Magnetized all of the armor sets from the core also. Not sure I will continue magnetizing my current expansion armor kits with 1.5 moving to narrative miniatures.

Closest thing to RPG in a box; thematic, challenging, and entertaining.

All in on Kickstarter 1.5 - Black Friday Gamblers Lantern.

RATING: 8.5
Extremely immersive, but also a bit clunky, a lot of stuff to check in the rulebook, changing between hunt and settlement is a bother, and the build options are not easily grasped. Have played one settlement until the Butcher (and ended up with three surviors left after his mangling of the survivors).

 About three dozen play throughs of the first act -- trying to master the game mechanics. Have not gone through the entire campaign yet.
Rated a '10' because I am a K/S backer and have two full sets of all the goodies (worked an ass-load of overtime).
Worth every cent.
Best production quality in a game by far. Sets the standard.
This is a mature, dark, desolate, themed and very immersive game.
Huge Developer and player community support.
Can't ask for much more.

If you enjoy the classical Lovecraftian Horror of lingering darkness and the powerless struggle against overwhelming adversaries, KDM might be for you. Great game for any sized group up to four players and even solo. Good replayability but very expensive purchase. The base game as well as the expansions are way beyond reasonable pricing.

Owned this since the Kickstarters were first shipped. Still a game I am pretty much always up to play solo. It's solid for group play, too, but I rarely get the opportunity to bring something this heavy to the table in that context.

RATING: 10
Top notch models, excellent and diverse gameplay, flavorful events at both the hunt and settlement level.

Excellent generational campaign gameplay with gear being passed from survivor to survivor as they die or become to old to hunt. 

The cost is a barrier to entry, but well worth it.

Comment after 1st day - 8 hours, 4 game rounds (settlement, hunt, showdown phases).
Excellent experience.
Fantastic theme, fun battles, great coop play.
Can be difficult, funny, traumatic and rewarding.
Best in class presentation, best miniature quality (although finicky to build).
Lots of luck involved, but also a lot of coop strategy. Well balanced on this front, to keep player feeling engaged and taking actions to sway the odds in their favour, while still feeling like there's an element of unexpectedness.
Expensive, but a worthwhile investment for those that are looking for a miniature heavy dungeon crawl.

Biggest con right now is that the rules can be a little unclear to begin with - the rulebook doesn't necessarily send you to the reference you need when you need it, and the glossary doesn't have all the keywords in it either.

RATING: 4
Demo playthrough. AI combat rules are clever, but campaign rules seems like a random table fest. Also, combat is very deadly and it seems likely that a character will make it through unscathed. I'm sure that will be a plus for some, but it doesn't really work for me.

RATING: 10
A very thematic civilization campaign and narrative driven game about a helpless and insignificant group of fickle beings striving to thrive in an impossibly sunless nightmarish landscape fraught with Monsters.

RATING: 9
Is it perfect? No. It is however unlike anything else. The shear overblown proportions of it, both literally and figuratively, are magnificent. The emerging narrative is both challenging and exciting.

The AI/health card system was a new idea as far as I am aware when it originally released and is an excellent addition to boardgaming in general. It gives each monster a distinctive 'personality'.

It will work best if you are a miniutures hobbiest already though. It could also be argued that the game is too big and complicated for it's own good. I embrace that though and so for me it's one of my favourite games (video or board) of all time.

Small annoying nuances aside this game is hands down a 10 for me due to it's replay-ability, quality and complexity. It also gets all my respect for being completely corporately 'hands off'. It is the game the creator(s) wanted to make, the creator(s) do not care about market studies, inclusiveness, racy art or what anyone thinks, it is the game they wanted to make, blemishes and all. That fact almost alone elevates this game above all others and demands my respect.

My buddy bought this and we played about 10 lantern years between 2 campaigns.  This game is simply amazing.  We didn't even have any of the miniatures!  We used Descent figures.

The mechanics, theme, rule book, cards, art, etc. are really, really interesting and innovative (at least to me).  The first few rounds seem a little dry and fiddly, but as you gain experience and begin to develop your settlement and survivors, the game really shines and you see how great it is.

There is simply nothing like it and in this case, that is a very good thing.

I played this on TTS and MY GOD the randomness. The game is fine until you get to the first hunt and have to roll a d% to figure out what horrible bull crap that happens to you. Almost all of which could end up being Nothing. 
Any fight that we ended up in after about the second was a cake walk. it was just the Random FUs that the game threw at you over a die roll. 
This game cost to much to have the same basic game play as a random loot table from the much better RPG it could have been, but wasn't.

RATING: 10
D&D like game with models with the atmosphere and storytelling, and very high entry level.

Exceptionally made game that not everyone will appreciate, as it:
- is very expensive,
- requires models assembly,
- optional painting,
- has complex and conflicting rules,
so mostly for D&D and profound gamers alike. 
Oh, and it's best for 1-3 players or even solo, as you are playing for the settlement, not characters.

If your choice is Sythe, Game of Thrones 2ed (not the card one), Twilight Imperium, then go for it if you can find any. 

Definitely a cult now.

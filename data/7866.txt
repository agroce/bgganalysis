I like this game. Sure, it's simple - but that's the joy of it. It plays extremely fast, and doesn't require loads of brain power - that's both good and bad. Truly fits a niche - and so will always be in my collection. But I'm not anxious to play.

RATING: 6
A fun pseudo-strategy game.  I like it, but towards the end it seemed to be the case of "I need this one piece" coupled with "if I can't find this one piece then what will I do."  I'd play it again, but it's not a must-play or must-own for me.

2-4. This is a game where you take turns switching out tiles from your row of 10 to make a sequential "vacation" on the USA map. Compared often to Rack-O, if you've played that. Rules: http://www.otb-games.com/pdf/10days_USA_rules.pdf

Fun little hand management game of sorts that's easy to learn and plays quickly. Falls in the light to medium range. Easy for kids to pick up quickly although they sometimes might have trouble organizing their 10 cards into a series so it's not really a kids game especially if played with adults. Nice family game.

I think I might have liked this game more as a kid - when added to my collection of monopoly, payday, pente and boggle.  But spoiled as I am with my game collection - the game flies below my radar.  I do admit to playing it with kids once in a while - and that's decent fun.

RATING: 6
This is a simple game that is surprisingly fun and quick.  Initial draw can be a big factor in how much work you need to do to win.  The initial placement of the cards as they are drawn is far more important than one may realize on the first play.  The components are not much to look at visually, but they are clear and functional.  The cards appear to be made of a type of foam board, so durability may be an issue.

Too random for my taste. You can't see what the other player is doing or planning, so there is not much you can do to interfere. Plus its a bit hard to visualize strategy connecting the various states, at least for me.

Gameplay is like Racko, but this one is much more difficult to manage the luck element in the game - and that is a challenge I enjoy.  The theme is very good and is definitely great at learning geography.

Great family game.  It takes a few game to wrap your brain around the card placemnt and setting yourself up for future turns.  It becomes a "playing the odds game" when only 2 or 3 cards can be used to complete your ten day trip.  I think it will be great to play when my kids are older, very informative with the US geography aspect.  I can already picture this game loosing it's appeal quickly though.

See '10 Days in Europe' comments.

I think I like this less than Europe.  It seems a little bit pedestrian to have cars though probably accurate.  (haha, bad pun.)

2015 Update: 

I fell out of love with the 10 Days in... series after I discovered that TransAmerica and TransEuropa using the SoloPlay rules are more fun and geared for solo play. 

I still think 10 Days... is a decent little educational game.

Simple, elegant, overall a fun game.

12-26-10:  I have some beefs with this game.

1.) If you get a setup that you need to change midgame, it can be almost impossible to do so.  Like, for instance, say you try to move a state that you have but need it somewhere else.  ...and it's the only state you need.  You discard that in the wrong discard pile, and you'll never see that card ever again. 

You always work from the inside out.  Though, say you have one on the front that would be the PERFECT card on the end.  In fact, it might be the only end card.  You discard it hoping to pick it back up.  Person 2 goes, puts a card ontop of it.  Person 3 goes, and puts another card ontop of it.  Basically, at this point, kiss finishing a whole set goodbye.  That one state you needed is GONE.  

While it's a good idea not to put yourself in this position by, say, always putting Kentucky or another massive connection state on the end...I still hate spending 90% of a game getting it done, and the last 10% hoping someone would put me out of my misery.  I like to always have options, and in these cases, it doesn't.

2.) The card discard meta-game.  If you know where someone is going to discard, you can bury your discards 2 down.  It seems trivial, but it's huge.  It's hard not to get up and scream when you have a situation laid-out like #1 happening, where you can get shut-down for good...  and it physically hurts to see a state you need, buried.  Because you know that state isn't coming back, ever.

A form of Rack-O, but with some interesting educational additions.  This can really help you learn where the states are, and the multiple discard piles makes the game faster and more enjoyable.  I still don't see a tremendous amount of strategy, though.  A really good initial tile placement can almost guarantee a victory.

Harder to play than the other games in the "10-days series" because each state appears only once in the deck (whereas, 10d-Asia, 10d-Europe & 10d-Africa have duplications of country tiles).  Kids & adults can enjoy this one together.

This is a thouroughly enjoyable game.  An excellent learning tool for the younger set, as they can learn both the US states as well as some good geography and map reading.  Having to plan a few hands out, as well as finding ways to shift the cards between the days, can get challenging.  Plays best with all four players, as you really start to fight for cards.  Overall, as well done game with good appeal to many different types of players.

I bought this game to be used in my US History classes to help my students learn geography. When I tried it out with my family, they actually loved it, which surprised me. This is a great way to learn geography. While the board (map of the USA is not necessary to play (if you know the states), you will notice everyone studying the map and looking at their cards and figuring out the best moves. End up really learning the states.

Similar description to 10 Days in Europe.  This iteration has cars and planes.  Alaska and Hawaii are purple - a wild color to show that any plane can serve either state.  It's the easiest for us since we're familiar with the geography.  Unfortunately, that also makes it a little less interesting than some of the other 10 Days versions.

Great game to teach kids some geography - we all have fun with this one.  Looking forward to trying the other 3 titles in this series and the 40 days around the world idea sounds like a blast!

We like this game.  It is above average.  The tiles are interesting because they have the outline of the States on them, with the names of the State capitols, the State populations, and the land areas.  More info would be even better.  Good game for learning US geography.  Might be improved by a point system instead of just the first person to finish wins.

I like this game. Played it at the WBC in 2015 a couple times with Wyatt and it's really simple to learn but was still entertaining, and it seems like a great game to get for younger kids to help them learn geography. Each player gets 10 tiles to start and lines them up. You do this one tile at a time, so you can't just put them in the best order at the start by looking at them all at once, but sometimes you get lucky. On your turn you can exchange tiles from your board with ones on the face up pile. The idea is to travel from one place to another (left to right) by taking different modes of transportation depending on the color of the state. Overall a very nice game - too bad it appears to currently be out of print.

The least of the 10 Days in...series is still a pretty good gateway game.  But I question the decision to make up additional states to make the map more interesting.  Wyoming?  North Dakota?  You were already stretching the bounds of credulity with one Dakota.  So you double down with two of the suckers?  Just slap Mordor and Elysium on there and call it a day.

The biggest problem is that, even with these questionable additions, the US geography is just boring and over familiar.  I mean, maybe if you're from Burkina Faso or something it would be novel, but I'm from 'Murica.  I demand exoticness in my travel games.

RATING: 7
The new version has god awful components.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Components: Wooden racks, cardboard tiles, and a thick board make this a positive departure from the Out of the Box production quality I associate with Apples to Apples. I'd like to see some cartoonish terrain on the states to make them less plain-looking, but otherwise it's a functional game. The theme works very well for me.

Experience: Far more methodical than its ancestor, Racko. I enjoy slowly piecing together my trip, and having to adapt my route based on availability of tiles. Throughout the course of a game I slowly begin to see that some areas of the map are in great demand, and thus will be difficult to navigate.

More enjoyable with two players, where I have greater flexibility and less luck.

A pleasant "gateway" game that can be enjoyed by nearly any age.  Like it's forebearer "Rack-o," there is some nice tension wondering whether your critical card is in the deck or somebody's rack.  Great graphics and production value typical of Out of the Box.  The whole series is geographically educational without pretense and badly needs reprinting.

1/10: right in the Princess' (7yo) wheelhouse. Just learning geography and 'gets it' with respect to route building. Yes, the route is linear, but like Rubik's cube, you need to know when to 'take it apart' to advance/complete faster.  I tend to favor states w/ lots of neighbors to give me more options. Princess LOVES to pull of the Hawaii and Alaska connections.

Gin rummy with states. An impressive blend of entertainment and education potentials. That being said, it didn't interest me, but I respect it for what it is.

RATING: 5.5
With my husband & friends, I have recorded over 1,000 games of 10 Day in Asia & 10 Days in Africa, and have given them high ratings.  I do not like 10 Days in the USA nearly as much (perhaps if I had played it first I would have liked it better).  It is excellent for those who want to learn the states, but the board is not attractive and the play for me is boring even though almost identical to the other two games. The only significant difference in this game is Alaska & Hawaii wild cards.  

However, If I still had elementary children I would buy this in a heart beat.

While the game easily compares to gin rummy or other set collection games, I suspect that replays will yield new impressions as experience sinks in.  A careful monitoring of the discards can reveal the hidden tactics of your opponents; when you realize that the discard piles are sort of a staging areas for cards you'ld like to switch on your rack, you have to be careful of not revealing too much and be wary of those cards being buried.  Fun game.

I am not a fan of puzzles, and this game feels too much like one to me.  The only player interaction is through the discard piles. Otherwise, building your sequence is done completely independently.

Some people have called the games in the "10 Days" series "glorified Racko". Now, I will definitely agree that there are some striking similarities with Racko. However, that's where the comparison ends for me.

10 Days in Africa gets more play but it's still a decent game.

This is a set collection game where you are trying to build a 10 day trip in the U.S.  Fairly fast & simple, and easy to teach.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The 1st installment in the "10 Days" series of games is an entry-level adventure that has gotten tighter as it was developed in successive games. Consequently, I think it favors luck more than the others and is less interesting to play on the whole.

The colour layout doesn't appear any more difficult than the other versions, but because of the 1-state/1-tile mix getting the tiles you want can take a bit of luck.

The only transportation choices are Cars (non-colr specific) and Planes (color-specific).  This doesn't allow a lot of leeway for strategy changes if you get stuck somewhere, and the state(s) you want are buried in a discard pile.

I'm rating this a 6 based on one play (a solo, 3-player "40 days Around the World" variant), but while I suspect that Asia and Africa might climb a little with more plays; I'm uncertain about Europe and the USA.

It is a fun diversion, but it is not a huge challenge, and the other games in the series really do it better.

An interesting way to end the evening. Very much like Rummy in that there's a lot of hidden information, you can't tell which tiles your opponents drew at the start so you can't know what they're looking for.

Basically the same as the other 10 Days games.  Rummy-esque with countries.  The people I played with didn't think it really would be useful for teaching geography, since you don't play on the board itself.  

Also, why does the USA get an entire map to itself when the other maps are whole continents, including very large ones like Asia and Africa?? (1 play)

RATING: 7
First played December 30th, 2009. It's taught in 5min and played in 30min with 4 players. There is a bit of strategy to this, however it's mostly luck. Since it's a great filler game, it gets a slight bump in my rankings. Each player takes 10 cards and places them one at a time into their slots without re-arranging them. After all have placed, then three cards are turned over and play begins. On your turn you may take one of the three face up tiles and must play it or take the top card from the deck. You swap out one of your 10 existing tiles without re-arranging any other tiles. The object of the game is to start in one city to the left and go to the last city on the right. To do this, the cards must be adjacent to each other, or you have a car tile in between two states, or you have a plane of the same color in between two same color states. The Car and plane tiles can not be used on the beginning or end of the 10 tiles. Hawaii and Alaska are wild flight cards and match any color.

Aug09:

Does exactly what it should do.  It teaches geography and does a little gaming too.

I was really surprised by how much of the game was in the setup.  I think much of the game can really be won or lost in your initial draw and placement.  That's fine with me, especially since you get to do that all at the same time.

The actual game play isn't *hugely* engaging, but there are some tough choices to make.  Interaction is limited to the discard pile, but with 3 piles you can definitely make sneaky moves.

I also have the other versions, but I'm just leaving them under this entry.  They are valuable for teaching other geographies and tossing in some fun trains and boats.

Rating may improve, but after the first 2 games this version seemed much too luck-driven.  The U.S. map is so dispersed that it is hard to create an initial plan and you end up either constantly shifting plans or waiting for the right state to appear.

10 Days in the USA is really just themed Rack-O.  The theme suits the game well though.  I like how large jumps between states can be made with the airplanes, but how cars are able to cut off one state.  It's a neat concept and plays pretty well and racks your brain without being overly complicated.

RATING: 5
[>5 plays for the series] This is a very light game that is easy to teach and learn. A good choice for quick filler (<15 minutes in most cases) or for non-gamers. High educational value for young ones. See also: 10 Days in Africa, Europe, and Asia.

Spiffy,quiet concentration; good for multitasking

I have only played this once.

I bought it because I am looking for games which I can play with my brother as we listen to talk radio show archives.

He does not want a game that requires too much concentration, because then he cannot follow the radio as he plays. I will see if this fits the bill.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The only real point I see to playing this is to teach children (or adults!) geography. There's a lot of luck in terms of drawing that last state or two for which you are looking. Players with good spatial abilities can set up situations with more options, and hence can "improve" their luck, but strategy alone will not win this game. I prefer the Africa version just because I am less familiar with the geography.

I love the idea of this game, but it just didn't do it for me.  The route planning is an appeal for me, but the initial placement phase drags a bit and the draw/discard loses it for me.  Vlaada Chvátil's excellent Travel Blog worked better for my tastes.

Bought to play with my wife. Should be interesting to compare with 10 days in Asia.

Upon play it did not match up with 10 days in Asia. The nature of the US map makes it a less interesting game and the travel mechanics where not as interesting. Won't hit the table unless we do a 40days setup. That being said, it's still a good game, especially if you're trying to teach geography to youth. I should note that in our eyes it only fails as a game in comparison to 10 days in Asia, and not on its own merits.

Almost an average game. There is very little real choice offered to the player in this one. Basically all you do is wait for the right tiles to show up or take your chances on the draw. I don't personally mind games with a high luck factor as long as there's still plenty of other options. However it's a grand teaching tool for U.S. Geography for your kids.

More or less the same as Europa Tour, but with a different geography. I know Europe better than the USA, so that game is a better fit for me.
Also I'm not sure what to think of the option to swap two tiles on your board. It gives room for some clever moves, but what use is a clever move if nobody effectively sees it? But it reduces the tension in the game, so I think I don't like this rule change.

I love the idea of the 10 Days games (especially their stealth education features for kids!) more than I actually love the games themselves. Nothing horribly wrong with them, they just don't wow me.

Plays 2-4. Part of the 10 days series. This is a super game. The gameplay is of course, very similar to 10 days in Africa. There are some notable difference that make the game worth getting if you already have 10diA (Which we do) There are no duplicate state tiles (unlike Africa) Alaska and Hawaii are purple and can only be reached by plane matching the color of the destination/target state (oddly you can't travel from Alaska to Hawaii...) States in the Four Corners aren't adjacent (you can't walk from Colorado to New Mexico...)

Fun little game for young families.  The geography part is great if you're looking for some extra bonus "edutainment."  Rules are easy for older kids to grasp.  Play can be a tad slow while you're waiting for your turn to come around.  Player interaction only occurs when you take a card someone is waiting for, or cover up a needed card with your discard.  Not a bad diversion for 30 minutes.

RATING: 4
It's a low-interaction puzzle game with a fair amount of skill in the playing and a fair amount of luck in the tile draw. The theme is thin, of course--it's a Euro, not a real game--but I think in this case it actually does help grasp the rules a little bit. Then again, the rules are quite simple to grasp, so that's kind of like making it easier to take candy from a baby. It sucks to be one tile away from winning when someone else completes his route. It's kind of interesting trying to set up your initial tiles in a sort of sensible matter, and if I were a total honk for the Euro experience, I bet I would love, love, love that aspect.

But I like things to explode and for zombies to swarm my machine gun nest. I've played twice, and neither of these things has happened.

Yes, it is basically a re-theming of Racko.  I would recommend this for your young kids in order to learn the states or perhaps as a filler.  There are some decisions with the card drafting and some luck when that connecting country you need comes up.  The game awards flexibility in your planning.

I really like this game system, and USA is my favorite I've played. This works as a similar yet different enough alternative to the Ticket to Ride series, and plays in as little as 10 minutes. It is both educational and fun. It can also be very tense not knowing what your opponents have, and the risk of putting a tile out to try and get it back on your next turn is an interesting gambit. Very fun!

Feels like Ticket to Ride, but faster.

Although this game is quite frustrating at times due to luck (or lack thereof) of the draw it is overall a pleasant play experience that can be mildly educational. It is a fairly fast game and that is good because with 4 players there is virtually no planning ahead for your turn and downtime would be a factor, but generally turns are fast. A family friendly game, just a bit dull.

This was my first game from 10-days series. It may be not much of a game but it is quite fun! I like geography and this may be one of the best use of geography into games.

I play this one with "No-Map" variant. We just have a sheet of paper that lists the color of states.

RATING: 9
A great educational game to play with the family.  But it's not just learning the states, it can also be a little brain bending trying to plan out your route.  Not too much, but enough to help develop those problem solving skills.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another in the 10 Days series of games, the game is basically what I remember Racko being, but with countries instead of numbers.  It's satisfying to get your route together, but it very much depends on luck of the draw, and it seems impossible to determine what your opponents are after, making the discard a crap shoot.  I think I like it better with 2 than with more, but it's altogether forgettable.

While 10 Days in Africa is superior for geographic education, this one is far more challenging due to the one-tile-per-state setup and the 5 colors instead of 4. I definitely prefer this one as it's fun for the wife and offers more strategy for me. She still kicks my butt at it though.

Changing tiles you already have across to different day positions feels clumsy and frustrating, but if it wasn't I guess the game would be too easy!

[b]10 Days in the USA[/b] was acquired in a math trade (1/21/18).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]The more I've played the 10 Day's games the more I realize that they are pretty fun fillers and definitely would be fun for kids. My older daughter, she's 12, played with me and really had fun too. So far I've played 3 of the 10 Days games and Europe is still my favorite map, but the USA map is quite good as well, just not as difficult to navigate which would make it better for younger kids. I don't own any of these yet, but I'm thinking of getting a copy of this one because it would help my 7yo learn our country's geography.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6):[/COLOR]

[i]I believe this is the fourth game in this series I've played. The USA map is similar to the rest I've played although the map doesn't offer any especially difficult sections to navigate (except possibly New England). I find this series of games to be okay fillers, but definitely not something I'd seek out to play.[/i]

RATING: 7
Fun family game: easy to learn and to entice others into trying. Clever design. First game might be a little slow while new players catch on the rules about traveling from one state to another, but after one game everybody should have it down and the game should play closer to the estimated 20-30 minutes--although having 3-4 players will definitely take longer than with 2. If introducing Americans to the game, this is the easiest to teach (except for the particular rule about moving to or from Alaska or Hawaii, which can be confusing for some). Played this with my sister, a total gamer, in July 2013 and she rated it an "8".

The 10 Days series is a little gem hidden out in plain site.  Some awesome strategy balanced with luck and decision making.  Do I keep going for what I planned out, or do I sweep that plan under the rug?  What cards have I already seen?  What is my opponent collecting?  Good little game.

Race against players to form the first successful coherent connection of all ten steps/days of their travel plan across the USA. Light-medium weight. Easy and quick to learn and teach. 30 minute game time. Quality production.

Not the best of the 10 Days series. However, it's still challenging due to only 1 tile per state. Alaska and Hawaii as wilds are a nice treat. For many players, the final portion of the game can turn into just waiting and waiting for that last tile.

Family Game! Gateway Game-ish! Casual Game! Church Game! Beer-N-Pretzels Game!

It gives me a distinct feeling of playing the old game Rack-O with geography.  I've enjoyed the games I've played, but it hasn't knocked my socks off.  To me it feels a bit like a "game on rails":  the game is going to progress, like it or not, and all the players are doing is drawing cards to make it happen.  However, on the other hand, my wife and kids love it, so that's where the "7" rating comes from.

The frustration of the drafting and racking mechanics is increased in this version as there are no centrally duplicated states as in 10D in Africa. There is more of a waiting game as it is more than likely that your opponent(s) will have the required state, so there is more of a sense the winner is the luckiest player.

I'm not sure there's that much of a game here, but it's essentially Rack-O that also teaches a little geography and allows for some light sequencing. It's not awful. It's intended for kids, after all, and let's please not pretend that they want the same brain burn that you want. It's far more likely that you'll see more cognitive dividends working on one developmentally-appropriate thing at a time rather than cramming as many choices and decisions into a game.

Another great game in the 10 Days Series.  It's nice being on a map that is really familiar to me (as opposed to Africa).  Since there is only one card of each state, it can bog down a touch with four players, but never feels like it is overstaying its welcome.  Neat game.

This game is basically a restricted form of rummy, where you cannot rearrange cards and the theme is a bit different. I suppose it can be fun, but it's hard to be objective given that I played this game with someone who took like 5 minutes to make a decision about what to do every turn.

RATING: 6
A fun little game - works well as a light filler.  A bit more thought required on this one as there are more options to consider when creating your route.  The most difficult (if you could call it that) part of the game is getting people to understand "no, you can't move the tiles around.  The first time out, it might take a few minutes to find where all the countries are located.  My son observed "it's a geography lesson disguised as a game", but that does not 'lessen' the enjoyment.  Even with a rules explanation to new players, it plays in about 20 minutes.

I think the 10 Days games are decent introductory games.  They are light and fun and the mechanics (get things in order) are pretty easy to understand while offering enough variety to keep your interest even if you've played before.

This was an interesting little gin-like game in that you are trying to put together one long run of cards that represent a 10 day trip in the USA.  That in itself predisposes me to like this game, though I will have to play a couple of more times before I bump the rating to the 7 I want to give it.  While I am confident this game could be made with a deck of cards without the US travel theme, I hope to get it in order to help my kids (3 and 5) get a leg up on their geography.

A rummy-like variant. Players are drafting cards to form a string of cards that connect across different states of the USA.

Not as good as the Africa edition. Sure, it gets a prop because North American gamers are 'familiar' with the map. However, there are just too many states. It makes the board look messy and making connections is a little harder than the Africa edition.

Of the 10 Days games, this one feels actually a little broken. The few times I have played it, the game really dragged on.

A role reversal has occurred at my house:  my wife is asking me to play a game no matter how late it is.  I actually bought it for my daughter, but it turns out he's a bit too young.  Then I taught my wife in about two minutes and it has passed Lost Cities as her favorite game.  I would prefer to play without the cars, but it's still a fun, light game reminiscent of Rack-O.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I got rid of Rack-O because it is not a good game.  If ever a game played itself that is one.  This game was touted to me as Rack-O for gamers...if you say so, I'll at least give it a try.

To be fair it is a little bit better than Rack-O for a couple reasons.  First of all instead of a string of numbers where each card connects to only 2 other cards this has you build a route across the US, so each state can connect to several other states giving you more options.  There are plane and car cards that can have you jump in your route either to another state of the same color or skipping a state in between two.  And finally, there are 3 discard piles so you have more than 1 revealed option.

In the end though this only makes the game slightly better than Rack-O.  You are still at the mercy of what is discarded and how your opponents decide to build their routes so getting what you can use is kind of random and the lucky player wins.  Plus, just the same as Rack-O, at a certain point in the game you are only looking for a couple of tiles so it plays itself.

I will say I think this is an excellent game for kids of the right age.  It is entertaining enough to get kids interested in Geography in a fun way and the series has games not just for the US but all different parts of the world.

10 Days builds on Rack-o in much the same way as LotR the Confrontation builds on Stratego: it adds a few bells and whistles to the basic engine in a way that adds a bit of light strategic interest and suits the theme. Not that this is as good a game as LotR:tC (it isn't), but it is a solid choice for introduction to people who only know the Sears, Roebuck game pantheon (Monopoly, Clue, Rack-o, etc.).

I was really looking forward to playing this game based on other's comments.  Unfortunately the game was a letdown for me.  It's not a terrible game, just not very interesting.  I don't mind games that have a fairly high luck component to them as long as there is some good strategy elements to balance things out.  This game, however, seems to be a lot of luck with very little strategy and there really isn't any player interaction going on to make things more interesting.  Overall a rather boring game in my opinion.

Fun game.  Good tool for teaching geography.  Of the games in this series that I've played, this is probably my least favorite, mainly because the territory is so familiar.  It's still a good game, but I prefer less familiar (to me) maps to play on.

This was an ok game for 2 people.  I wouldn't play it with four as it makes it very difficult for people to obtain the tiles they need.

We have a lot of 2 player games that we like better so it ended up being traded.

[one play] Too quiet and uninteractive; I prefer fillers that promote more enthusiastic play.  A bit too much time waiting for the right tiles to come up.

RATING: 5
10 Days in the USA is an okay quick filler, but I think it has some issues especially when playing with four.  Your own trip is too easily disrupted, usually by accident, by the other players.  Since everyone has ten tiles hidden, and a lot of discarded tiles are gone for good, whole blocks of tiles are unattainable.  If you should need some of those, you will never complete your trip.

This game fell flat. Maybe there is some educational goals to achieve, but the actual game play did not have a story or other interesting game play. But it took a little too much concentration to be social, such as rummy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Very simple game that entails some tricky hand-management decisions. 4-player games can bog down a little bit since there are a lot of tiles that people will just not see, leaving limited options. 2-player games end a lot quicker since there are more good tiles per player available. I have not played 3-player, but that is probably the sweet spot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
10 Days in the USA was a perfectly fine game until the designer created 10 Days in Asia, which added a fourth transportation type (rail) to juice things up for gamers.  At that point, the others were sort of rendered obsolete unless you're firmly attached to the locale.  This is Rack-O with geography and good for family time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A quick and easy collection game that can be explained in under a minute. Bad draws can irritate the heck out of you and leave you stranded somewhere near Wyoming, but the frustration only sets in a little bid before someone wins. A solid game for kids, families, and casual get-togethers.

Meh.  Interesting concept, but much of the game is just spent drawing cards and saying "Nope, didn't need that.  Nope, didn't need that."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The comparisons to a chromed out Rack-O are largely legitimate and may speak volumes about why theme matters,  but theme is not the only thing that differentiates 10 Days from the aforementioned. 

For one, there is a game board,  however that's a bit deceiving as it is only used for reference.  Largely,  there's much more to think about here.  as all tiles are not created equal.  Also, there is color consideration, travel tiles and a discard mechanic that involves more than simply tossing the unwanted onto a single established pile.

It all works out charmingly and offers a fun challenge in a light weight package.  I have not tried the other 10 Days titles and have little desire to do so.  The familiarity with the position of states is an important part of the game for me - leaving less time spent searching for where something actually is,  thus not distracting from the relaxing experience this game has become.

I find this one not as fun as 10 Days in Africa.  Each state gets one card, where Africa has some key countries with two.  

USA has some nice features.  The handling of Alaska and Hawaii is done well, and I like the information (states, capitals) presented.

I had seen the "10 days in..." series before, but never really noticed them or knew what they were. And that turns to be a geography game about taking a trip.

There's a big mess of tiles, most of which are states but there's also some planes and cars. You start the game by picking 10 tiles to put into your 10 slots, one at a time. Once you place a tile, it can't be moved. After everyone is set up, you take turns drawing a tile, either from one of three discard piles or from the pile of tiles. You either put that tile in one of your 10 slots, discarding the one it replaces, or just discard the tile.

You want to build a path from your start tile to your finish tile, where every tile shows a state that borders the state on the tile next to it... with some exceptions where you're using transportation. The person to finish a valid trip first, wins.

It's a fairly simple game with a fair bit of luck. But it's quick and fun.

What an amazing gift from Megan and Mia: they MADE me this game using old cereal boxes and a U.S. map. They like the 10 Days series and just went with the same rules, and it was such a touching gift. it took them nearly 2 days to make it. I'm so proud of my little boardgamegeeks.

It was pretty good.  Fast play, good mechanics, and interesting.  I have no problem with the high luck factor, but the luck here never seems to lead to any nice surprises.  I think I like it better as a 2-3 player game where the luck is more controllable.

First play - 3 players. I had a good time with this. The components are nice. Heavy tiles and wooden racks. The board is colorful and clear. The game moves very quickly. This is a great game for kids as well. It's fun so its a great teaching tool to get kids to learn where all the states are. You just have to mention that Hawaii and Alaska aren't actually next to each other. =)

RATING: 5
Suffers a bit from the card draw, especially the more players you have, but otherwise an OK game.  Really, the winner is decided by who draws the right tiles first, and it's possible (though unlikely) for a player to win with his initial draw.

1 play: 4 players

I was going to rate this a 6 based on my own feeling of where the game fit in the hierarchy of games, but based on the Geek's definitions, it's definitely a 7.

[b][i]10 Days in the USA[/i][/b] is a game system that's easy for newbies to learn due to its similarity to Racko. With repeated play, you come to realize which states need to be anchors and which can serve as stepping stones in the middle of your journey. Play can be frustrating with four players since discards are buried more frequently, leaving you and others in a position where you're simply trying to draw the win.

Dozens of playings of [i]10 Days in Asia[/i] have dropped my rating of [i]USA[/i] as the game play is simpler and less interesting. For the young, the geographically averse or those being introduced to the series, [i]USA[/i] is still a fine option.

Very nice, approachable game. Toughest of all the 10 Days series, because there's only one of each state. So it tends toward lockups, where no one can win and no one has an incentive to defect (as their LHOs will then win).

An excellent game for all ages. Can be used as an excellent basic geography game for kids.., and possibly a refresher course for some of us adults. Simple premise with adequate amounts of sequencing, planning and evaluation of choices, with a sprinkling of geography, color matching, boundary awareness. A good starter game for those who are not into gaming a whole lot.

A different experience that 10 days in Africa because there are so many more areas here, and there are many states that don't have many adjacent areas. The first time I played this it took about 30 minutes. 10 days in Africa has never taken me longer than maybe 15 minutes at the most, so this was a bit of a surprise!

I like this so much I'll be targeting some of the other versions in trades for sure!

Most of the strategy lies in placing your tiles well at the start.  From there, it's either hope you draw the right tile(s), or hope that your opponents discard what you need and then don't cover it up.  A nice pasttime.

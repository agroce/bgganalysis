A very good 'upgrade' to the original GWAS: North & Baltic Seas. The revised scenarios are very welcome, as is the revised OOB / counterset.

Good war game with a lot of pieces. Somewhat similar to old Avalon Hill game but with scenarios and ship counters again in a miniatures setting.

4/15/2010 - just bought this one. Looks like Avalanche got it right this time - everything you need is in the box, and it's an overstuffed box at that! I can't wait to get into this one!

I've only played it a bit.  Lot's of ships and scenarios but to play you need to do some paperwork.  I'm looking forward to trying an operational scenario.  My rating here is in part due to my so-so interest in naval wargaming.  I think it will go up with more plays.

Haven't played this one as yet. Rules are set out well and it's pretty easy to understand. The only reason it doesn't score higher is the "simplified" combat. Not enough meat for my taste but I understand why it was done.

WW1 battleships fighting on the high sea....Very cool box cover art. The entire War in the North Sea and Baltic, 1914-1918. Fifty scenarios, 490 double-sized ship pieces, and 420 standard-sized pieces. Released in mid-Dec 06.  Arrived in Jun 07.

The Operational part of the game is truely splendid, the tactical part though, i'm still in doubt off, planning to pick up the Dreadnoughts expansion to see if it fixes this.

RATING: 7
I prefer the more detailed maneuver and damage rules in Battleship Captain to the tactical game in the Great War at Sea.  The strategic aspects of GW@S look interesting though.  One could easily mix and match the two using tactical combat from Battleship Captain (or one of the other, even higher complexity, games) with the strategic aspects of Great War at Sea.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
My overall impressions of the game are very favorable. The operational game feels a lot like what I've read of the history of the period. The tactical combat, while being a little too abstract, is still tense and a lot of fun.

Le falta un juego de campaña en condiciones para dar sentido al horrible sistema de las trazas pre-escritas en tablas.

Good fun way to get a double blind style game without an umpire. 

My illogical mind is incapable of properly co-ordinating a proper sweep for hidden unit raiders...

If you are looking to get into this series this is the first game you should get. It has everything you will need with tons of ships and scenarios. 

The game extremely comprehensive. Besides scenarios for the big battleships and Jutland itself it has ships and scenarios for the Norwegian and Swedish navies as well as WW I aircraft carriers and zeppelins.

Have only played the tactical battles so far.   They are fast and fun.  The strategic part of the game looks very interesting.  Time restrictions limit my opportunities to try it but I believe it will enhance the tactical side of the game.

RATING: 8
The flagship issue for the GWAS series. I play these games compulsively, my mind out there somewhere in the salt spray and the ocean roar. I use mine and fired counters from a TCS game (GD'40 if you must know) and like to try out the various variant rules published by Avalanche or by other players. I read somewhere that Avalanche will be publishing a game or supplement entitled Red Oceans which will, I hope, develop on the WW2 situation in the Black Sea, and the Baltic. (A year later...) Of course, that last comment wasn't strictly relevent to the topic, but, just so you know, APL have since released Black Sea Fleets, which covers the fighting in the 'friendly sea' 1939-45.

Great game, but the rule book is a bit contradictory at times.  Highly recommend getting the High Seas Fleet supplement, which balances out the fleets and opens up the entire map.

I wanted to like this game, and do appreciate the dual-scale (operational and tactical), but some design choices simply don't make sense -- no facing rules at the tactical scale?!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Operational game is very interesting. Beautiful counters. Tactical battles too long and dicey. Annoying quality problems like map missing country borders even though some rules refer to friendly/enemy coastal zones, and there is only one weather marker for the two weather zones.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is an excellent game with many scenarios and quality components. If you like the age of big battleships this is a great intro to the system. I highly recommend the use of the tactical combat rules from the Dreadnoughts expansion.

RATING: 9
A rating of 9 (using Dreadnought rules). (Optional smoke may be excessive in the first, small ship scenario.) As written the Tactical rules produced boring movement and predictable damage results based on the probabilities of 2d6. Except in cases of overwhelming firepower asymmetry (boring) the winner is pretty much random (Rating = 4). It's much more exciting (if no less random in outcome) to roll for initiative at EVERY movement step (Rating = 5). These tactical-based ratings would be even lower if not for the beautiful counters and essentially historic outcomes. The Operational game appears to have enough merit to made this game, as written, rate a 6 or 7 (ie  2 over the tactical).

Note: Have played many GWAS Operational scenarios. A lot of good thought/gaming can be had. Balance is better but many of the Victory Conditions are weak. Rules gaps are pervasive and house rules abound. Overall, a lot of fun in this 'kit'.

Note: Switching to simultaneous combat with Initiative used only for (smoothed) movement. Combat is so 'fickle' that good tactics can be overtaken by 'extreme' dice so just enjoy the experience.

Note: Later GWAS/SWWAS games have increased the fuel points/fuel box to a historically more accurate 24.

I really like the GWAS period and rules although hate the 'battle map' (with stacking? - stacking at sea? No, no, just no!). So I sort of converted the rules for use with minis. Then wrote my own WW1 naval rules. Beautiful counter artwork though - you can actually just use the counters on a big, blue felt hex mat if you like - instead of minis. Surprised GWAS haven't suggested this themselves.

RATING: 8
Naval combat in the Dreadnought Era; from WWI to the 1930s. This game covers the Jutland action, and most WWI operations in the North Sea and the Channel areas. Combines a strategic game where players move their fleets around a theater, with a tactical game when vessels make contact. Easy to learn rules and fun to play: similar to naval miniatures but with much simplified combat and maneuvering systems. Great looking, plan view graphics of the ships, on double size counters for most vessels. If you're into Harpoon or COA's Admiralty series, these games may not give you the detail you desire.

RATING: 9
I ought to give it a 10 for having the Danish navy ! - and intriguing scenarios for its use...

No, really, for me, this is the point of departure in the GWAS series. I played the Battle Scenario for Jutland a couple of times, and each time the results were very close to historical, both with the advanced rules as well as the Dreadnought supplement rules. Roll-for-sixs is deceptively simple, but the chrome in the rules (spotting, facing, manageable system of penetration) gives just the sort of "involved realistic variety" I expect from a naval wargame.

The operational level is where the game shines, and all the scenarios are very well balanced, as well as historically lausible - even the ones where the Germans can actually "outsink" the British navy. I have played about half the scenarios, only the Jutland battle scenario more than once, but so far, I have not been let down. 

The lack of a campaign game keeps me from giving a 10. I want a campaign game. Guess I have to do it myself.

Jutland entry for the GWAS series, replaces/updates Northern Waters.  7 battle and 44 operational scenarios covering the years 1905 (Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Germany) and 1914-1919.  I recommend using the GWAS: Zeppelins supplement with enhanced airship rules, along with the GWAS: Dreadnoughts supplement tactical rules, when playing this game.

I started out looking at the GWAS series to create scenarios or campaigns for minis games.  I'm still planning on doing that, but have also fallen for this game just to play and enjoy.  Hoping to scrounge up a few players in the Dayton area.

RATING: 5
Two battle games behind. Regardless of the dice rolling on the event of close quarters fleet action, game flow is fluent and battle results are closely in line with historical results - in my opinion, it is better to have smooth rolling battle sequence provided it is historically accurate even though it does not show every single casualty etc. The cream of the game is hide and seek and luring opponent to battle with unfavorable odds.Yes, ships on the both sides take significant damage - sometimes enough to put them out of action but it is up to player to pull the ship out from the line before damage is excessive - there is no game mechanic that forces you as the commander of the fleet to pull out due morale failure of ship/fleet crew. After reading accounts of WW I battles, I am quite convinced that battles between dreadnoughts were quite like described in the game.

The counters are glorious.

The map is solid.

The operational rules are usable, if clunky. (I'm sure a superior referee-free system could be cooked up, but I freely admit I'm not sure how).

The tactical rules are worse than useless. Tactics are basically nonexistent, where they do exist they are unhistorical, victory is generally determined by the initiative die roll, and the loser usually takes absurdly high casualties.

Lots of chrome and lots of ships in this one.  The perfect game to round out the GWAS series with planes, carriers, and zepplins.  The usual excellent map and counters but I wish they had updated the tactical map to something better looking.  A must for any afficionado of the GWAS series.

Big game with a ton of ships I never heard of... I know little about WWI naval combat, but I like this game seroies as games. Relatively simple rules, once you get your head around some strangeness. The tactical rules seem overly simple, but GWAS Dreadnoughts solves that.

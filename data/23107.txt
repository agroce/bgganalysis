RATING: 7.5
This is a great 2 player game to play with my 6 y.o son.  His ability to plan several moves ahead is improving.

It took about 5 plays before we were comfortable enough with the tiles to play the game well.  Now the game is very enjoyable.  I just bumped up the rating, and may rate it more highly in the near future.

RATING: 7
Not as well produced or as satisfying as I'd hoped, and my father was completely confused by it (not that that tells you anything). Strangely plodding and not quite the slick, sword-and-sorcery adventure that we were hoping for. Perhaps needs more table-time to flourish!

I finally got this out on the table over a lunch time.  It was pretty enjoyable, but needs more than 2 players, I think so that there's less chance someone can get a gold collecting loop going (gold room leading to a teleport room, teleport back to the gold room.  A very cool game for the price, definitely one to take away on weekends at the beach.

RATING: 7
This game delivers exactly what it sets out to do: a fast, dungeon race that's approachable. You play tiles to build up the map, zoom around from room to room and gather up coins to win. Quite a bit of conflict happens in stealing coins and tiles and using the dragon. I like what it does and this latest edition has great components. A winner.

I want to like this but in the few times we've played there just hasn't been all that much fun;  it seems like the "Drakon" has been a very minor character in our games.  I still have hopes for this, but they're fading....The game just seems to be broken....

RATING: 6
An okay filler game that is a little bit deeper than my initial impression.  I don't like that players can be locked down and unable to take action unless freed by a sympathetic opponent.

Good quality tiles.  Like most tile laying games, it looks cool when it's being played.

Decent tile placing game, some tiles are way more powerful than others so it's mainly luck that let you win, but the game is short enough to not care too much

RATING: 6
The components are nice.  This game feels too chaotic with a lot of players and there doesn't feel like there is enough depth to the game for a small number of players to get much enjoyment out of it.  I haven't tried the game with teams and it may be quite fun with 6P in three teams.  My rating doesn't reflect the game played in teams.

RATING: 4
Not a fan.  The components are nice, I suppose, but the gameplay is just not that interesting:  Play a tile or move your piece.  The randomness of what tiles I'll have available in my hand and on the board doesn't bother me so much, but it just seem that much fun.  

Pretty quick though, so it's not like I'm wasting time by playing =).  Just could spend it on better things.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Like Carcassonne, but with more conflict and planning. I like the higher player interaction, though the fantasy theme can turn off some players.  the components are nice, but my tiles have bits along the edges that are difficult to clean up.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
2 plays with 2 players, using the heroes variant and standard scoring.  first game blew by instantly, the second seemed at a point like it was going to lock up forever but a victor quickly emerged.  i still think that the gold stealing tiles should be changed for 2p games, perhaps removing one set or treating them as blanks.  repeat plays could reveal how much or how little control there is in the game, but i think it will be fun to explore either way.  it seems like 5 or 6 players would be too much.  good box, rules, production in general outside of the slightly funny tile smell.  i ended up playing the 4p team game, and it went on a bit too long.  we didn't have any gold spaces on the board for a while though, and a harp was dominating the start space.  a testament to the game's variability, but it showcases how it can sometimes drag.  i think i prefer 2p just because there's less that can happen in-between turns, so i focus more on specific combos.

Great game! Nice figures, bits and tiles! I didn't play the game before this new edition so I'm new to the game and find this one very interesting. My first play was in a 2 player game. It was fun and fast. We played in about 30 minutes including setting up the game and unpunched all counters and tiles! 
Some tiles effect are very cool and interesting. I think playing this one with more players (or in teams) will add some chaos into the game. I'll try it as soon as I get a chance.

I'm terribly disappointed in the quality of this supposed upgraded reprint.  First, the upgraded figures-- They're miniatures now instead of cutouts, but they're all a dull grey.  I'm not sure it's acually an improvement.  The tiles are bigger, but they have a pretty poor punch job.  EVERY one of mine came out with THREE large nubs on EACH side of the tile.  They don't even butt up against each other as you lay them out. And, they have this odd linin finish that is so textured that they almost look semi-glossy or satin finished.  And the icons are very hard to read.

Should the quality affect my rating this much?  Well, if I don't want to play it because of the quality, I think it should.

Was left scratching my head at this senseless, ugly mess of a game.  Takes a common enough concept and abstracts it to the point of completely detaching myself from immersing myself...wait, why am I in this dungeon?  Run by what?  Random--huh?The rules, at least as explained to/read by me, were full of holes, and multiple inconsistencies or ambiguities came up in the two sessions I played.  Was shocked to see the rating this game has achieved here.Never again.

Chaos factor is evident, with the several tile abilities changing the best path to gathering victory points. Loops are popular in order to get back to the coin tiles quickly, and players need to cooperate to disrupt these placements or players can quickly gather points.

Recently played this again for the first time in years, and don't see any reason to change my ranking. It's just not that good of a game.  Very little tension, anticlimactic ending, and repetetive turns.

Great game, tons of fun!  Only problem is the possibilitiy of one player laying out endless loops, but even that can be overcome by saavy players.

Mixed on this one as it's fun and the way you can build combos of effects in rooms is pretty enjoyable, but it's also the type of game that I'd rather avoid and just play other more recent titles instead. If I want to close out the night with some beer and pretzels fare, I'm going to Skull or Cockroach Poker. If I have a bit more time I'm going Wiz-War which is far better than Drakon.

Primarily why this doesn't achieve that extra step is that it feels dated, and it lacks any sense of real excitement or drama. It's very abstract and fails to get the emotions going.

RATING: 5
This is like a hand-management tile-laying efficiency-engine with a gallon of bile poured all over it. In a good way. It takes bash the leader to its logical conclusion. But in a timeframe that keeps things light and (un)friendly. Lay a tile or move your guy. In laying your tile, you make your part of the dungeon better, someone else's worse. Moving your guy pretty much does the same: improve your position or screw someone else. Hopefully the leader. Points are partially hidden through a hidden token mechanism, so you never know who's really leading. Try and put together a nice little loop to harvest VPs. But pretty much any tile and any move by any player can wreck your engine. So play, have fun, and don't freak out on the person who uses the harp to send you off to a dead end that will take four moves to get out of. Y'all know what I'm talking about.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Players: 2 − 6 

A tile laying/area control game with a few special powers thrown in for variety. Simple, fun and usually fast.

You score based on building a favorable path through the dungeon for your character to travel on, sometimes multiple times, netting you points (gold) each time you land on a “gold” tile.

You all start on the central tile and grow the dungeon from there. It’s like laying out a program on the table. Setting up the right tiles beside each other to create some nice little loops to rack up gold for yourself, while setting up traps for your opponents. Of course your opponents are doing the same, so your loop might get interrupted. By a dragon.

Many of the tiles themselves have “powers” other than just creating a path. Most are still geared towards motion and movement of the players. Portals, rotating the tiles, the harp (draws a player to it), wind, (blows a player away), etc. The mind control tile makes for some fun times. These types of tiles are what really makes the game good and keeps people from exploiting a path for too long. There’s no real combat or confrontation in the game. Just manipulating the path.

The characters each have a special power you can use once per game in the "advanced" rules. Helps to add a little more variety and control over your fate.

The dragon doesn't actually come into play that often and the result of running into her isn't much of a setback. While I like that there is no player elimination, encountering the dragon would be a bit more thrilling if you lost more than a single gold coin. How about ALL your gold coins?

FF has done a nice job on the 3rd edition.  High quality (and lots of) tiles, nice plastic miniatures.  This is a fun, quick filler game with a good amount of strategy.

RATING: 10
27+ plays (5x3p, 15x4p, [1x TeamVariant2x2], 6x5p, 1x6p--from 3&1/2 different groups of friends). Excellent fun played in high spirits and sassy bad behavior. However, unlike some games, might not be fun to play with people who don't find laughter in the experience. Great with beer and obnoxious good friends who help bring the nasty magic. Seems like it would be logic puzzle but turns out human players aren't robots here. Still, tricky moves are waiting for you. P. Invented the expression, "Harp you!" which is perfect-o. I like the character powers, like playing multiple times in a row, the artwork, and playing drunk. I also like using the barbarian power to push the wizard into the tile with the dragon that he put there for me, clearing the path for me. Yes, this is one of those games where a friend gives me the finger (laughing). Possibly could use more Dragon tiles, but not sure. Easy rules, nice player aid for the tile icons, play can be ingenius, plodding, annoying, vindictive, or bludgeony. By "plodding" I mean placing barren tiles in your fellow player's path. Maybe gamers need to bring laughter to the game for its best performance. Amazon.com says it's worth 200 bucks now (Feb2011) thanks D for spilling beer into the box! Another time, I asked a friend, "Do you mind if I remove the game component that you are using as a plate for your pizza?" -- "No, I don't mind." (Not realizing...) Hazards of the grape... Seems to becoming one of my favorite pub games. I rate this a 10 to play with people who will laugh with me, but something less otherwise. Does work for 6 players. Must be reprinted soon. .... June 2015, new addition arrived!

This is about building a dungeon with special rooms, essentially trying to organize them into money making machines, whilst also trying to screw everyone else running around the dungeon. Excellent design, plays up to six players, easy to teach, quick.

RATING: 6
This game worked poorly as a 6p game....but I'd like to try again with a team game. Its not bad if you know you're going to be playing a light, chaotic dungeon crawl. If people continue to bash the leader (like they should) the game could potentially drag on for a long time. I'd be willing to play this one if someone else requested it, but I doubt I'd ever ask for it.

I wish this game were better than it ultimately turns out, but that being said it's pretty good for what it is.  Drakon is a great concept- a 20-40 minute dungeon crawl with palpable theme, some great interaction in terms of theft and the potential for some really nasty plays, and excellent production values (3rd edition).  The problem is that unlike Dungeonquest (which Drakon is sometimes compared to) there is practically no drama and the stakes just seem way to low- even the dragon just eats your money and puts you back at the entrance.  It all seems very unengaging and unimmersive despite the graphics and theme (probably because it's really a programming game at heart), but as a counter that statement it's also extremely easy to play and is short enough to avoid irritation.  It's a "one action" game, which I'm not terribly fond of, but it's one of the few dungeon crawls you can probably get the Euro folks to play.  There are several variants included such as special player powers but they seem negligible at best and somewhat tacked-on.  In sum- it's OK and I wish it were more.  If you own Dungeonquest and love it as much as I do, you'll likely find Drakon to be harmless fun but definitely not a surrogate.

RATING: 6
I was surpised how much I like this. We strongly prefer the variant where you have to get out of the dungeon with the 10 gold. Furthermore, we require that you walk on to the tile, so while you can play an Escape tile and immediately teleport onto it, that doesn't count as exiting the dungeon. That is, there must be a full turn for everyone else to try to stop you. Otherwise it felt like just a game to see who could draw the Escape tile. We played this 5 or 6 times the week I got it.

Played a six player game first game, had a blast. The turns play very quickly, and it is very cutthroat with players stealing gold from each other. There's a great sense of control with the hand of tiles.  This is going to be a great large group game for future times to come :D.  One thing it suffers from is that there can be a runaway victory, but usually the players doing nasty things to each other keeps it balanced.

Update: Gave this away, there's just something else I would rather play than this.

Great game, I love the elegant design and the unique tile abilities.  I like the way you can set up combos or break your opponents' combos.  It seems to scale well regardless of the number of players, but the more players there are, the more chaotic it is.  There is definitely a luck factor involved in winning, but for me the fun of this game is finding clever plays, regardless of who wins. The theme is also very fun, new players get a kick out it when I explain the human eating dragon.  This is one of my partner Kelsey's favourite games.

Kipróbáltuk a 4 fős játékot, s nagyon bejött nekünk. Így elsőre az jutott eszembe (és a feleségemnek is), hogy a Munchkin-hez hasonlítható legjobban, ha a játék egymással kiszúrós aspektusát tekintjük. Csak a Munchkin kártya vezérelt, ez pedig lapka vezérelt. Hogy a játékról is ejtsek pár szót, alapvetően ez egy lapkalerakós, fantasy témájú, kevés és jól értelmezhető szabállyal és jól használható segédlettel rendelkező, egyszerű, egy bizonyos társasággal (nem sértődős) nagyon mókás és hangulatos játék, ahol a fő hangsúly azon van, ki hogyan tud legötletesebben borsot törni a másik orra alá. A játék arról szól, hogy egy csapat kalandozó próbál meg kimenekülni (vagy 10 értéknyi aranyat összegyűjteni, játék változattól függően) egy sárkány kincses barlangjából, melyet a terem lapkák lerakásával minden játékban másképp építünk fel. A legtöbb terem valamilyen speciális képességgel bír, ami biztosítja a taktikázási lehetőséget. Ezen kívül a hősök is rendelkeznek egy bizonyos képességgel, melyet a játék során egyszer használhatnak. A játék maga nem túl hosszú, amit azért el lehet nyújtani társaságtól függően. A sógorom a tegnapi játék során azzal volt főleg elfoglalva, hogy a barátjának hogyan tud legjobban keresztbe tenni és vica versa. Ezen persze folyamatosan jól mulattak, biztosítva a játék remek hangulatát. Visszatérve az első gondolathoz, akinek a Munchkin tetszett, annak ez is fog. (2014.09.18.)

This is one of those games that I want to like more than I actually do like. Despite the production and artwork it just feels gamy. I don't feel a dungeon.

RATING: 7
Never has a game made me want to screw with my opponent more than this game.  Winning in Drakon is actually one of the most trivial points to the game when you can have fun alternating the board to affect other players.  The wonderful thing about this game is that people don't take being screwed over in this game as badly as being back stabbed in A Game Of Thrones, Diplomacy or something similar.  This game is wonderfully devious.  Unfortunately, a problem exists with the game that can completely render sometimes multiple people unable to do anything for multiple rounds & possibly until the end of the game: Harp Room next to the Starting tile and placing Drakon in the Harp Room while one or more players are on the Starting Tile.  I'd advise some house rules to fix this issue.

RATING: 5
The components are well-made and good-looking. This is about the only good thing I can say about this game. I couldn't enjoy it, mainly because of the excessive amount of randomness (you need 10 gold to win. Any coin you pick can be worth from 1 to 3, so you may win with 4 picks or you may need up to 10). Hero abilities are one-use only, and not nearly as relevant as I feel they should be; sadly, some of them even cancel each other out, leaving two useless heroes on the table who may as well have never had a special ability. 

Overall, Drakkon feels more like a joke than an actual game.

This game...  is garbage.  No balance between hero powers. Slow moving game play with nearly meaningless decision making.  Molds of miniatures taken directly from Descent?  No cards to give to each of the players to represent their hero and inform them of their hero power. 2 games of this down and I keep re-reading the rules thinking I am missing something because with how we are playing it...  it sucks.  If someday I find that we were misplaying the game in some way I will retract my rating, but for now I can legitimately say that this is the worst "gamer game" I've ever played

A fun game that doesn't contain any cards (which is strange for me since I love card games). The randomness of the tiles leads to the stratagy of where to place them and how to play your chosen character around the board. Fun game, especially with more then two people. With two, the games last too short, so the more you can get, the better.

RATING: 6.75
This is one of the simplest games to pick and play I've ever seen. Yet the gameplay is quite fun. It's a tile-laying game in which you attempt to be the first amass 10 gold to avoid being eaten by Drakon, whose home you have invaded in search of treasure. One hero gets to leave with some pocket change; the rest are lunch. You use the tiles in your hand to either help yourself or stick it to your opponents. It's the "gotcha" factor and the many twists the chamber tile actions bring into play that make this a fun game. It's easy for kids to pick up and enjoy, and adults get a kick out of frustrating their opponents. As it says on the box, it's not whether you can outrun the dragon that matters; its whether you can trip your friends on the way out the exit.

After having played a number of times, it's starting to get a little dull. A good drinking game, though.

The first edition of this was one of my favorite Fantasy Flight small box games. For some reason I didn't like the game as much when the expansion was added. 

This 3rd edition is much nicer with larger tiles and so forth, but they have included some of the expansion tiles into the main game with this version. I still enjoy it, but i'm not convinced that the initial version didn't flow better somehow.

That being said, this is a tile laying game where you can do nasty things to the other adventures. Lots of fun screwage. If you can build yourself into a loop where you go through 4 tiles and run over one or more gold every time, you can win this one pretty quickly. It is up to the other players to prevent you from doing that.

Not much in terms of strategy, but it's a very nice filler. This edition has more colorful artwork and beautiful plastic miniatures - although I can't understand why they have to be all gray. One production issue: The tiles are thick and sturdy, but the terrible die cut makes it almost impossible to punch them out without tearing a few.

While it may technically accommodate 6 players, with even 4 it is a bit too chaotic for my taste. There is nothing to plan while you wait for your turn because the board will have changed so much. For how little control you have, there are way too many different powers to keep in mind, though the playmats do help with this. I'll play, but I'd rather play something else, and I don't really want to buy this. 
UPDATE: Upon further reflection, it seems like this could be a good step up from Labyrinth. I would like to play again to confirm, but with some reservation, I am adding this to my wishlist.

Surprisingly good. It tempted me from the shelves of my FLGS for too long, I finally gave in - there's a lot of tactics in the tile laying business really, and the short rules make it very suiting as a quick filler.

Also, my copy has painted minis. Somebody must have painted them :whistle:

Edit: I played with six players now, and I must say that this game is actually a lot better than I thought, less a filler and more a proper game, at least given enough players. And it's still newbie friendly. Amazing :)

Raised again from an 8 to a 9 (was at first a 6).  The only additional comments to be made are that this game is fun with just about anybody.  It's a fun tile placement game that Carcassone wishes it could be.  After playing this, I don't know if I'd ever want to play Carcassone as it has a fiddly scoring system and is far too random.  This game is terrific with just about anyone and is a fun game to play - not a brain burner, just straight out fun.

The amount of screwage in this game can be hilarious.  There are plenty of different tiles and setups so you can try to make all kinds of different loops and patterns to maximize your efficiency and screwage of others.

However, king making is a serious problem.  If you're in the lead, two people near some dragon spaces can easily clobber you down to nothing.  This can cause the game to drag a little if there's more screwage than efficiency going on.  The random draw of the tiles can be a pain too - some people are getting exactly what fits for them and you're getting crappy blank tiles that are of no use.  It's good to have some luck, but that can be a little irritating at times.

Overall I have a lot of fun playing this game.  I'd like to try this with more people to see the kinds of crazy things that might happen!

I liked the premis behind this game, but in play it seemed like it was simply trying to lose the other players.  Odd number of players has an advantage.  Also, the hero abilities seemed a little unbalanced.

RATING: 7
Very simple, and supposedly a quick game to play, but personal experience has indicated that this game is prone to analysis paralysis. It's meant to not be taken seriously, making the play quick and fun. However, it can become a tactical game of screw-your-neighbor, where careful play is necessary to extract that precious extra 'tempo' needed to win the game--then it becomes like chess. That means the game can get bogged down, as players analyze and predict and anticipate, to optimize their play. Great plastic miniatures and handy player aids. After the basic game is mastered, the optional rules incorporating one-time-use of special powers can be fun.

Update (12/18/09) 5 plays: A quick, gateway filler, when you have several newbies and are still waiting for others to arrive. The mechanics are simple: move or play a tile. Victory conditions: get 10 gold. Constraints: make sure the tiles direction arrows don't point at each other. Other than that, all the rules are contained on the players' cheat-sheet. That's it--you can start playing in like two minutes; no need to go over each tile, as that would take too much time. Let the newbies figure it out as they play. The game will be over so quickly that they will insist on playing it again. Several games can be played, until other players start showing up.

I was hesitant to pick this one up, but ended up trading an unwanted game for it, and am VERY glad I did! Drakon is much more than the simple "wander-through-the-dungeon" game I was expecting. Our first play was not promising - my opponent almost lost interest right then and there. We gave it another try though, and started seeing the cool possibilities the tiles provided. A few more plays and we were hooked! The various effects of the tiles make for a game with many different, dynamic and creative strategies. A particular tile may seem useless when you draw it, but proper play can make it a game-winner. And I've never had so much fun seeing MY OWN plans ruined by the smart tile play of my opponent!

This is a neat little take-that dungeon crawl/ dungeon creator (?) that plays quickly and unpredictably.  It's pretty volatile and probably very different every time. Don't look for control or planning here.. but try to take advantage of whatever comes up. Light, fun, engaging.  (3 plays)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
In need of a desperate overhaul. Their is a mechanic that breaks the game, and once you figure it out...there's no escaping from trying to do that every time.
The goal in this game is to be the first person to acquire 10 gold. When you select the gold you don't know how much it could be worth; either 1, 2, or 3. So this does make for a potentially shorter game (though I don't think this effects the fun). You start out with a small dungeon and as the game progresses, you keep lying out more tiles.
The tiles are the heart of the game (and also part of the games brokenness). Each tile has a different function that helps you get to the, oh so coveted, gold tiles. Different tiles can change the layout of the dungeon, release the dragon (aka Drakon), teleport characters, and so on. One tile in particular lets you travel in a loop and gain very quickly. If you're not on it...there's really nothing you can do to stop it.
Each person selects a different fantasy character (Dwarf, Wizard, Barbarian, ect.) each of which has a different power that can be used only once per game.
All-in-all, still a very enjoyable experience.

First played this on Feb 9th, 2007.  This tile based game is very simple to learn and play.  The luck (drawing tiles) is fair enough.  The strategy seems to be more of how to avoid being the recipient of someone's attack rather than trying to out gain your opponents in gold. Each player is given a character with special abilities and 4 starting tiles. On your turn you either play a tile or move. Tiles include empty, gold, mind control (moving someone), dragon (move dragon 3 spaces), take a coin from left or right of you, teleport (move to anywhere next turn),  steal a tile, destroy a tile, escape (move yourself to this tile once placed), replace an existing tile, etc. Tiles must be placed such that the arrows don't point to each other. Winner is the first to 10 gold.

Drakon is really just an excercise in route planning.  Of course, I love programming games, so this is right up my alley (don't be fooled by the pasted on theme).  I think a few more coins need to be collected before the end of the game is triggered though since it seems to end way too fast.  The dragon doesn't seem to do much either, unless someone is really convinced being vendictive is the way to go.  A few more tweaks to the gameplay and this could be a definite hit.

First play with 5. Drakon is a reasonable take on the dungeon-crawling genre. With a little thought the tiles can be used in very devious ways to hinder other players. However, the variable value of the gold pieces introduces too strong an element of luck in determining the winner.

An awesome dungeon "crawler" that doesn't try to ape the mechanics of its RPG big brother.  Drakon plays like a puzzle game where each action must be carefully calculated.  Having a hand of tiles reduces the randomness of other similar tile-laying games.  I would recommend Drakon to everyone who wants a light crawler with great rules.

RATING: 5
This is a cute little nicely themed game that accomplishes what it sets out to do, produce a little fun in a short time frame and scale well although I think it is really meant to play 4 - 6. 

It is mostly luck so it shouldn't be taken too seriuosly and makes a good filler game that should come in around 30 minutes, it is meant to be fast paced as well (game time is easily adjustable by how much gold it will take to win). A little screwage possible and nice that you are building the map by placing tiles. Might be worth picking up as I can't think of too many good filler games for 6.

Drakon is in my humble opinion a game of pure genius, it plays fast but still there is allot of decision making to be done.
On the other hand if you don't like "stick it to your neighbor kind of games you might want to steer clear of this one.
If on the other hand you are looking for a fun and fast game with some luck an lots of laughs this one might hit the spot for you.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (December 2012)

I like the game, however I prefer to play with the second edition rules, that is, I dislike that the coins have random values in them, I prefer to play that each coin is worth 1. 

The miniatures are very cool for now they are the only advantage (I can see) to own this over the 2nd edition , however the game smells very bad. I have played with two different copies and both smelled awful. I´m not sure what variant or rules changed from the 2nd edition to the 3rd edition (other than the random coins). I think now you can move the dragon.

Drakon is a fun light game to play from time to time, I was thinking of buying it, but that smells prevents me from getting it. Besides I already own the 2nd edition.

The 3rd edition ups the production quality of the game and keeps what I believe to be the best tiles of the 2nd edition expansion and gets rid of all the redundant and marginal ones.  I have played the teams variant and I like it quite a bit.  Right now, it is my preferred way to play Drakon.

Another Tom Jolly classic. I feel the second edition is slightly better but I sold it for this version. The minis, as always, are a welcome addition but the tiles are a little too big and cumbersome unlike the earlier edition.

This is a fun game and with more players this becomes a bit chaotic and even more fun. There's luck, chaos and tactics included and the combination seems to work well. You get a good dungeony feel and if all players are willing to choose their own paths this could even get quite hard. The team playing option lessens the amount of luck and makes planning more important. As a team I think it's really hard to get those 20 gold and therefore the team with more tiles in the end may be in a too strong position.

This game takes your favorite dungeoncrawl and boils it down to a logic exercise. Mind you, that's not such a bad thing - it's an almost abstract, Knizia-like design, and still very much worth playing. An enjoyable game that's just a tad longer than it should be.

One of the special powers punishes you for winning by winnowing your hand of tiles down by one, and in a game where you already have only nine possible decisions to make per round, it's maybe not the ideal design choice.

Wonderfully simple once you get the chambers down.  Every game presents a new challenge and requires a different strategy.

It seems as if the Drakon itself is prone to breaking the game, blocking everyone into a dead-end hoping for a tile to escape with as they watch another player wander unmolested through the rest of the dungeon.  Odd that I'm considering the best house rule would be to play with out the namesake.

Lot's of different tile types to learn.  Seemed hard or frustrating to move around much as the tiles seemed kind of limiting.  And the dragon really didn't do anything.

Can be a fun dungeon crawl, but it can be frustrating when you are nowhere near the edge of the map, and still have to play a tile somewhere. Towards the end of the game, we find that we are wasting time deciding where to put tiles that are never going to be used, and it kind of slows things down.

Drakon 3rd Edition is a dungeon tile-laying game of cause and effect in perpetuity.  In my opinion, Drakon 3rd edition should be BEST played with teams/partnerships.  Two versus two or three vs three with no table communications between teams.

Fairly unexciting but quick playing dungeon crawl of sorts.  Quite a bit of take that element in the game between drakon and tiles that let you destroy other tiles or switch them out.

This is an AWESOME game. I have only played with two people so far, and if the game is as good as I think it will be with the max number of players, the rating for this will definitely be going up. Carcassone for the Ameritrash crowd. Just keeps getting better with each play.

I have never regretted trading away game as much as I did after I traded away Drakon. It is a ridiculously fun tile laying, engine building game. You can't get more simple with mechanics, and because this is a tile laying game no two games will ever be the same. I find myself always trying to build the greatest engine I have ever made each game, and the game is never dull. Lots of opportunity for meta gaming, as well as trash talking. Even though I traded for an expensive copy a week before the 4th edition was announced I didn't regret my trade one bit. Drakon is one of those gems that belongs in just about every game collection.

Great "filler", I'm guessing this should (please, please do) replace Carcassonne as the official filler of my group. The obvious confrontation makes this a great "race game", and a perfect addition to my collection :)

There's little to none decisions in the game, you just have to work with the luck. But it can get nasty if the players work together against the first place. I guess this could be fixed with a higher treshold of the coins. Still the game is fun enough to keep playing it for at least a few months/years. You see.. when my friends like a game, they stick to it... I expect to play this a LOT, and I expect it to stand the test...

"Carcassonne: The Dungeon"

I like the game though have two gripes. First, the icons are not very self-explanatory. As such, you have to reference the player aids often to see what tiles do. Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning. Second, and more importantly, the endgame seems flawed. Money is hidden and the first player to 10 gold wins. As such, you don't see the end coming.

Untested fix: put 5 gold coins per player in the dragon's horde. End the game when the horde runs out. Most money wins. This way you will be able to see the end coming.

Traded.

3rd edition

This is a screw-you game all the way. Not obviously viscious, but it comes out at times. But it is light enough not to cause too much hurt feelings. The theme works well for the mechanisms. The 3rd edition is worth keeping.

Played this again 10 years later with gamers...Very tactical game, not quite as light as it appears. Holds up despite its age. Still very much worth keeping.

RATING: N/A
The old dragon Drakon has captured a brave band of adventurers who have sneaked into her lair to steal her gold. But rather than eat them immediately, Drakon has decided to make it a game: Greed shall set one of the adventurers free. She sends the frightened adventurers into her magical, mad vaulted chambers, and the first one to collect ten gold from Drakon’s maze gets to go free. The rest get to be lunch.
Each turn, players must choose one of two options: (1) place a tile from their hand onto the board, expanding the dungeon; or (2) move their Hero to an adjacent tile. Many of the dungeon tiles have an icon that allows players entering that space to take a special action (for example, taking a piece of gold from the dragon's hoard, stealing gold from another player, or destroying a tile that is already in play).

A fun tile laying "gotcha!" game with a fantasy theme. Not the deepest part of the pool, but as games of this type go, you'll need to dog paddle.

I used to own the second edition but didn't like the pieces or the game after a couple of plays.  Now, having played the latest release I'm much more enamored of the game.  The tiles are thicker and better quality, I love the figures (even if they are rooked from another game, or so I hear), and the tweak to acquiring gold definitely improves play.  A really great game.

A simple lightweight game that does feel different every time.  Extremely easy to teach and doesn’t overstay it’s welcome.

I just feel that they are better games out there as fillers.  However, if you see this game on the cheap (e.g $10 or $15), I would grab it.  It’s still a fun game.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Chaotic, backstabbing fun. The randomness of the tile draws, and the sheer number of ways they can interact depending on where they wind up, makes this a very different game every time you play. It's pretty easy to turn the screwage dial to maximum, and equally easy to wind up hosed before your next turn.

Like most games of this type, the biggest downside is that it's not hard for one player to wind up completely sidelined for a large portion of the game; that's not much fun. For its weight, it's also a bit too fussy; it's not long enough to warrant fussiness, and not short enough to make that fussiness tolerable.

I hemmed and hawed about selling this one off, but years with no plays eventually made it clear that I should. Sold.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Very good game. It's a strategy boardgame where two other more players (until six player) can challenge.
If you want to win the game, you must take ten money by dragon's treasure.

SS-06 present. Huzzah!

23 December 2007 
I owned, enjoyed and traded 2nd edition away. With the then imminent release of 3rd edition why not trade away second. 

Comparisons to 2nd edition:
3rd edition tiles are larger
Cardboard standups are replaced by plastic figures
Drakon  is introduced as an active antigonist
'Lock breakers' are introduced - in 2nd edition it was possible, not always easy, but certainly possible, to lock an opponent into a loop that they could not escape. (Gust of wind, Mind Control, Tile Destroyer,Map Stealer all contribute to this. These tiles still exist in 3rd, however Gust has been streamlined and is less ubiquitous.) "Escape" tile fixes this by breaking the move or play tile rule. It also creates interesting strategies allowing one to build a tunnel with treasure at the end and then "escape" past the tunnel near the treasure. "Floating room" ...

Excellent game to warm people up to the deeper stuff. Easy to teach, and the cheatsheets for each player is useful, and crucial to maintaining quick gameplay. Very little analysis paralysis making for a steady game. While you can effectively lay a path for yourself and run across it, it is infinitely more fun to set traps to screw over your friends. Being mean is definitely where this game shines.

Dungeon-building themed tile laying game; lay tiles to form ever-increasing dungeon, and move player piece into different 'room' to enact effect.  Played as okay filler game for two people.  Not buy-material, but would bust it out to kill some time.

RATING: 5
The premise behind Drakon is that you have all been captured by a dragon and you are trying to escape.  There is a starting tile, and then everybody starts with 4 tiles in their hand.  On your turn you may add a tile to the existing tiles, with the arrows pointing the right ways (the arrows tell which way you can move around the tiles), or move your figure one tile.  If you move to a tile with something special on it, there is a summary sheet explaining all of these, then you get to take that action.  Some of these gain you coins and the winner is the first person to get a value of 10 from all their coins.  Another thing the tile can do is let you move Drakon, there are lots of things and I won't cover them here.

This game has a lot of theme to it.  And you might feel like you are moving through this cave, but it wasn't all that fun.  If you aren't anywhere close to the leader, and if drakon isn't close either, there is not much you can do to stop them.

I gave this a 5 because it is a nice fast filler game.  It isn't something I'd want to play all the time, and I'll never buy it, but when waiting at the game store for people to finish up games it is better than a lot of the other games people suggest.

A fast, simple and easy to play dungeon crawler that has players racing around a dungeon trying to amass coins. I enjoy this game for not having a lot of RPG-ish elements that most (if not all) dungeon crawler games have which lead to 4-6 hours of gameplay. There are many strategies to employ with the various tiles and since the map is constantly shifting and other players are also trying to hinder your progress, no game is ever the same.

RATING: 6
An interesting game with some flaws.  Not really dungeon delving (no combat) and not really economic engine creating (too much screwing with people) places this tile placement/meandering around the board game in a unique position.  The game plays fairly quickly and can lead to moments of hilarity when you are able to make horrible, horrible things happen to your friends.  However, with some of the basic rules the game can run away with a player quickly and end suddenly, without much you can do to stop it.  Variations (some of which are included in the manual) are require to slow such things down a bit.

I can see this game being fun. Unfortunately, my gaming group has a couple of players who will play games and not try to actually win. Yes, winning isn't the point of gaming. However, if you have players that don't try to win and instead just mess with the other players it tends to break some games. When you have a player who is only laying tiles and stealing them from other players the game generally takes too long.

Drakon 3rd is a great little game that is dead easy to teach and play, difficult to master, reasonably quick and different every time.

It's also the long standing "newbie favorite" of my collection. High screw factor but no reliance on dicey luck.

Its worth noting though that as I play more games and absorb more into my collection it sees less and less play. The game is still a gateway beauty, but its playability is watered by expanding knowledge of better, more satisfying games.

Progressive Rating: 9-10-9-8-7.

RATING: 7.5
Drakon is a mean and nasty game of pseudo-collusive computer programming. Requires 5 or 6 to play well, and requires players to overtly assist each other in stopping the winner. Also all but requires the variant that the winner must reach a teleport or escape. This is one of the most misunderstood games on BGG, chiefly on account of its theme.

I played with 3 people.  Kind of boring.  I can definately see how it would start to shine with a full compliment.  In light of this I will refrain from rating this yet.

Finally  played with a full compliment and it was great!  Tons of interaction and really makes you think about how you're going to "program" your character's path.  Fantastic screwage moments abound in this game so if you play with someone sensitive you might want to warn them about that before hand.

Could almost use a retheme in the way of TRON.

Okay game that's vaguely reminiscent of Betrayal at House on the Hill, for me, minus the traitor. You run through a dungeon collecting gold, trying to mess others over, and be the first to reach a certain amount of gold. The game is fine, and I did enjoy it well enough, but there's almost no strategy whatsoever. You just lay down a tile, and hope no one messes with you while you try and go for a room with gold.

Good time length on this one; more tactics than strategy, and you have to hope for good tiles. With the luck factor and the screwage of opponents, it oddly has the feel of a card game like Uno. But it's more complex -- it's also a puzzle game, and a fun one at that.
-----
Knocking off a point for being a bit boring and repetitive on subsequent plays.
-----
Downgrading from 5.5 -- the more I play it, the less I care for it. It's interminable, as everyone has a last-minute screwage move that puts the kibosh on someone's plan to win just as they are about to... just a never-ending chain of this. so much so that I've just said fuck it and kingmade out of sheer not caring.

Our first game was with 4 players, and boy was it fun! In the middle of the game, it suddenly turned into a bit of a team game as temporary alliances formed between nearby players using the same "loops". Quick, lots of player interaction and interesting decisions, and above all FUN!
UPDATE: Played with 6 recently, and it seemed a bit too chaotic. I think I prefer 4, or at the most 5.

This is a fun little dungeon-crawlish game where you're trying to build a dungeon, using the various types of rooms to gain gold and prevent your opponents from doing so.  All in all, this was very simple and a lot of fun.  The only thing I didn't like was the hidden money values--I didn't think this was necessary.

Fun light screwage game. Not much of a dungeon crawler but rather a race to be the first to acquire 10 gold or just to screw anyone else in the dungeon, whichever seems more fun at the moment. The gameflow can vary a lot on the tiles drawn and played, which means sometimes it might just not be that fun.

A great light dungeon romp!  A perfect little game for fantasy lovers.  Light enough for casual gamers, but also a great thematic filler after some day-long Descent marathon.  Nice player-conflict aspects as you try to create traps for your opponents or send the dragon to chew on them, and yet the penalties aren't ruinous.  It's got a great tile-laying map-building aspect, but it can sometimes be exploited if someone makes a loop (which makes for a very short game indeed).  Never feels too long.  The "special abilities" seem a little tacked on and unnecessary.

So far so good. Although there seems to be a bit of randomness involved (any game where you draw "cards" will be so), it is quite enjoyable.  A bonus is that it is very easy to teach...there are only 2 things you can ever do on your turn, move or play a tile.  You can't get much more simple than that. This means it should be accessible to your non-gamer friends (always a plus). I have yet to have Drakon (the dragon figure) come much into play, though. While the game plays OK with 2 players, 3 or more is ideal. With only 2 players, the "gold stealing" chambers are a bit too powerful.

This is a good game for when you are in the mood for a "everyone pick on whoeven may win at this point" type of game. It was a hit with my seconday game group, but I don't think many from my primary group will get into it. However, that won't stop me from bring it out.

I take it back. Played with a key memeber in my primary group and he actually enjoyed it. However, we both agree that there needs to be more than just two players. Four is probably the best minimum to play with, I would guess.

The grizzled old man sat in the inn as he told the adventurers about the hidden dungeon rumoured to lie just outside the village. "There's no control once you get inside, you can't hold on to the treasure for more than a minute and some of you will take for ever to decide where to move to your next abstracted chamber - but you'll be in and out in 30 minutes". The brave adventurers sat and thought for a minute, before the barbarian groaned, stretched and headed for the bar. "Sod that, I'm grabbing a couple of pints instead," he said.

Doesn't pretend to be more than it is, and does a good job of it.  It is a simple, get-the-leader style of game set in a dungeon with the possibility for some clever plays.  Not as good as WizWar, but can handle more players without bogging down. 8 year old kids can play proficiently and have fun. I like it quite a bit - not as brain-burny as Dungeon Twister which is definitely in the same ball park.  I must admit I kinda want more: more special powers, secret alliances and vendettas etc etc but as a half-hour game it is good fun.

Like Cave Troll... easy (actually "ier") to get on the table w/my 10 year old and 11 year old. Not a whole lot of theme (it has one but it ends up being more about laying down tiles).

RATING: 4
I enjoyed this much more than I expected, but still not a whole lot.  The evolving dungeon and chaos of the room effects is interesting, but the core game has some issues.  Since you either play a tile or move + activate, any tile you play is available for every other player before it is available to you.  So, if players are clumped, nobody plays any good tiles, and the game stalls.  If players separate, it is mostly luck of the draw.  But what you draw and who follows you around are completely out of your control, leaving the game feeling rote and arbitrary.  But still, there is something charming about trying to find efficient cycles inside a shifting maze.

All in all, the key strategy to winning seems to be "draw valuable gold chits" more than anything else.

Initial impressions: Simple rules and a low game end score threshold. Sounds great, and the tile powers are sufficiently nasty. I've only played another Tom Jolly design, Wiz-War, and that one is similarly simple and both have quite a bit of variety in tiles/cards, so there's an initial steep learning curve what with having to read lots.

Light and fun tile laying dungeon crawler with easy mechanics and convincing theme.  The well known Terrinoth's adventurers, also seen in [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=117&Itemid=1]Descent: Journeys in the Dark[/url][/i] and [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=148&Itemid=1]Runebound 2nd Edition[/url][/i], get into Drakon's lair in order to steal this dragon's treasures without being noticed. To do so, players can move their characters or lay a tile in their turn.  Most of the tiles trigger effects when someone moves in, moves out or when they are put in the table.  The first one to get a value of 10 gold wins, nevertheless there is an official variant with different ending conditions.

5/12/10 Really liked this game. Looking forward to playing it again soon. We played with 6 players. I need to throw some paint on these minis. I'm going to give it a tentative 8 until I get some more plays in.

6/23/10 Second round of games wasn't as exciting as the first. Like the game, but I think it's closer to a 7. 

7/15/10 Not sure if I'll keep it or not. I think I'll look for another 6 player game to replace this one with.

9/8/10 Took a break from this one for a few weeks, came back and had a good time playing it. I was done with it and now I'm not so adverse to playing it more. Might even think about re-acquiring it.

I played this for the first time tonight (11/21/06), and it was pretty cool. RacklessJester and I played 2p, and in one game I was able to empty his hand, stranding him with nowhere to go and no tiles to play. I guess he almost won before I pulled that off, but he didn't so it was an auto-win for me. In the next game we played without the Map tiles (I actually don't think any came up anyway), and it was more interesting.

RATING: 7
Interesting little dungeon crawl. Lay tiles or move - satisfy the conditions of the tile when you land on it or the next time you move. First one to 10 coins wins. Pretty simple and forgiving, yet tactical at the same time.

I've only played with three players so it did seem to have a kingmaker problem. However, the short play time more than makes up for it. While one player can snatch victory from you leaving the other player to make their move unmolested, this isn't too big of a deal as you can just start another game and try again. Comparably, losing a 3 player game of Attika (which is a completely different game, but another 3 player kingmaker type game that I own) is much more frustrating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun tile-laying dungeon crawl. Players either place a tile or move their hero 1 space. The goal being to get 10 gold. Most tiles have an ability that's triggered and many involve 'take that' elements. It makes a decent filler and players shouldn't take it too seriously.

The components are much nicer that the last edition.

Mindig jelzem, ha egy játékról a véleményen eltér a BGG-s összértékeléstől. A Drakon is ilyen, de ebben az esetben úgy érzem alul van pontozva a játék. A játék inkább erős 7-es, mint erős 6-os. A játéktér különböző tulajdonságú szobákból épül fel. A játékosok a kincsekért járják a sárkányvár szobáit, amelyek különböző érdekes dolgokat tudnak, ha a játékosok belépnek rajtuk. A játék szobái véletlenszerűen épülnek a játékosok kezéből lévő szobalapokból így nincs két egyforma játék. A sárkány bejövetelével a kincsgyűjtés még izgalmasabbá válik. Érdekes játék gémereknek és nem gémereknek egyaránt.

What a fun game! You can either build your own "highway of gold" or you can try to screw the other player out of his hard earned gold. Games can either be sweet and quick or become epic "cat and mouse" sort of affairs. Easy to teach and I haven't found a single player who didn't like it.

RATING: 5
Well, they fixed some of the problems with the first two editions by adding variable numbers on the money so that you don't know for sure who is winning.  The tiles are nicer and so are the figs, but really the game still drags interminably. This should be a filler, but it just takes forever as people constantly screw each other and add to the friction that one must surpass to end the damn thing.  Better with team play as it means you have another player helping you to end it rather than to slow the game down.

Interesting idea, and normally I'm all over a tile-laying mechanic, but the execution isn't great.  Restrictive character movement, combined with large imbalance between the useful tiles and the crappy tiles, means this game comes down to good tile draws: get 'em and it's strategic and interesting and fun; don't get 'em and it's dreary and hopeless.  Usually you don't get 'em.

RATING: 6
Decent dungeon crawl and fun for something different.  I would think that it would play best with lots of players, as with only a couple of players, it would be too easy to wronk each other and never reach the goal.

UPDATE:  This game is really best with 4 or so, I would think, since with 6, it's hard for someone to hang on to enough money to end this game in a decent amount of time.

Variant Marc von Canal (Swampfox01):
* When placing a coin tile, place a random coin on it.
* The first player to reach the tile may pick up the coin. The tile does not provide any more coins.
* When a coin tile is picked up and later placed again, another coin is put on it.
* If a player loses a coin, due to Drakon or the Lose a Coin tile, the coin is placed face down on the player's tile. Any tile that contains a coin is considered a Coin tile. A player who enters any such tile with a coin gets the coin instead of encountering the tile. The tile reverts to its original type at the beginning of the next player's turn.
* To win a player must escape (Teleport or Escape) with coins valued at 10.

This game is popular with my daughter and has gone over well with many types of people.
Cut throat and Thinky. There is no player elimination but you can get stuck with no way to win or do anything. This is rare however. The biggest issue I have with the game is the playtime can vary from real short to way too long at times.
This game is currently Out of Print.
My game has self painted minis.

With the wrong person in a group it can be slowed down by analysis paralysis but that's usually the exception not the rule.  Why do the tiles stink?  Other than that it's a great game with some strategy and good/bad luck mixed in.

RATING: 4.5
[6 plays?]  I am not sure how many times I have played this, about half a dozen.  It started out as a decent light, luck filled filler.  However, it is clear this game just does not work with my regular gaming group.  It it just not meant for analyzing to this degree.  People play just to make the game drag on forever, it ceased to become any fun.  I still can enjoy it as a light filler with some people, but really this games has some flaws.

RATING: 7
This game feels like it should be Ameritrash because there's some nice screwage going on, but it feels very optimizational in gameplay because you're really trying to set yourself up for a chain of gold coins.  It's fun and simple and a game that I'll definitely play if asked.  Very different from pretty much everything I've ever played.  

This deserves a reprint.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This game is definitely not for me.  Run around in a dungeon trying to collect coins with a random value from 1 to 3 and the first one to 10 gold wins.  The tiles that you place form a dungeon and when you enter a room you get to activate the special power.  The special powers are neat but in the end you are just trying to bash on the leader and collect a bunch of coins before the other people.  You have a hand of tiles which mitigates some of the luck, but I dislike the random vp draw on top of everything else.
Good points.  It's pretty thematic and you do get to explore a dungeon with a dragon in it.  
I'd rather play something else. 2009/12/15

Interesting odd game where you build and move upon a dungeon.  Play a tile or move your character; watch out for the awakening Drakon.  A bit of a take-that game, a bit of a collect-the-gold-coins game, but not as cut-throat as some of Tom Jolly's other games.  Fun and light.

A szabályokat olvasva tetszett a játék. Aztán a játék végülis az elvárásaimnak megfelelően teljesített, és még mindig jó játéknak tartom.

Az első játék alapján az az érzésem, hogy elég nehéz egy bábúval megoldani, hogy eljuss oda, ahova szerenél, pláne, hogy a különleges cselekedetek végrehajtásához a megfelelő lapra kell lépni. Ha valaki beszorul valamelyik zsákutcába, akkor nem igazán tud mit csinálni. Vaktába épít és reménykedik, hogy menekülő lapot húz.

Igaza lesz Lalának, hogy nagyon oda kell figyelni, hogyan építjük a pályát, mert sok múlhat rajta. Következő partinál erre fogok koncentrálni.

RATING: 7
Fantasy theme is great, game play is simple, but somehow, I always seem to find it hard to stop my opponent when I have a lousy hand of 'coin' rooms. Very luck-based. Perhaps need to play with more players to be truly fun.

18-04-08 - Played this with 6 players for the first time last night and although it started out slow, the rest of the time was filled with major screwage as players stabbed each other over and over. I actually ran out of tile cards and got stuck in a dead-end room, which meant that I was out of the game. Still, this is fun with the right crowd.

Played this over at a buddies the other night, I really enjoyed it.  Theres a heavy "you bastard" gameplay element as well as some neat little ever changing strategy and tactics in play.  It follows simple dungeon crawl/tile laying game mechanics with some good old-fashioned betrayal.  I rather enjoyed it, seemed like an easy one to teach people as well.  The Dragon never really came into play unfortunately.

Really fun filler that puts you into the role of a greedy cave robber.  You hang out with everyone else to be able to jump in on the big score.  Unless of course, you think you can "find" the big score on your own.  Then you wander off from the group and "get lost".  Greedy greedy greedy.  A good bit of fun, jam packed.  Our game didn't grind to a halt.... but it sure seems like its possible.

A good fun "mess with the other guys" game that can lead to some great moments. As long as you're not concerned about optimal moves, efficiency, and all that, you'll have a blast. It's simple enough, but depending on the players it can drag on (get it???).

When I was first introduced to this game (right when I joined my first game group) I thought it was one of the best games I'd ever seen and went out and bought it soon after. I still enjoy it, but I've cooled down since then.

The old dragon Drakon has captured a brave band of adventurers who have sneaked into her lair to steal her gold. But rather than eat them immediately, Drakon has decided to make it a game: Greed shall set one of the adventurers free. She sends the frightened adventurers into her magical, mad vaulted chambers, and the first one to collect ten gold from Drakon’s maze gets to go free. The rest get to be lunch.

RATING: 7
An amusing family game with very little rules but quite a large reference sheet for all the different tiles. After one play, however, players will be familiar with most of its instructions. Because of the random tile draws, some games will be a lot longer and/or a lot more fun than other games, but given the short playing time you can always have another go. In my book, Drakon belongs to the "good kind" of beer & pretzel games - games that can be played quickly and casually, but still require some thought. And which have a potentially high screwage factor. Good with two (both my girlfriend and my 9-year old son like it), possibly best with three or four players.

I've only played this once and it was a six player mess.  We played three teams of two with the goal of earning 20 gold for a team win.  This 30-minute game dragged on for about an hour and a half.  For the length of the entire game, I felt like I was on the receiving end of all of the "take that" that was being meted out (and I was never even in the lead to be eligible to be a target. I was just there with gold in my lap, sitting to the right or left of other players).  After the 10th or so coin is stolen from you, things become even less fun than the minimal fun you were already barely pretending to have.  I agree with some of the other low raters that the theme never grabs you by the throat and immerses you in itself.  I never once felt like I cared about this game except possibly the first one or two turns.  I know a game sucks when the idea of spice trading with fellow medieval merchants sounds more fun than stealing treasure and running from a dragon.

RATING: 6.5
A fun tile laying/screwage game. The room abilities make quite a fun little choice selection while the latest edition gives it the 'chrome' to make you want to play it. It's better with 3 to 4 players as that increases the choices and expands the dungeon's layout. I want to paint these miniatures!

Ewww.  This take-that game is too slow-moving and too fraught with randomness to make it any fun.  You have remarkably few viable choices every turn.  Everybody hoards their coin tiles until the group splits up and then lays down all their good cards in a frenzy and hopes that the other people don't mess with them before they can create their looping path and get to the goal of 10 gold pieces.  There's random screwage, but no way to directly take down a leader unless you hurt yourself to do so.  Very, very boring and stupidly simple.

RATING: 8
Much improved over the 1st edition and expansion.  Bigger tiles are easier to see.  The differing value of the gold coins allows the leader to perhaps be unknown and not having to return to the middle help send game sooner.  **Would be interested in playing the team variant - I think it would work really well. **

The old dragon Drakon has captured you and sends you into her magical maze gets to collect gold. The first to find 10 go free, the rest get to be lunch.

Each turn, players must choose one of two options: (1) place a tile from their hand onto the board, expanding the dungeon; or (2) move their Hero to an adjacent tile. Many of the the dungeon tiles have an icon that allows players entering that space to take a special action.

Having played this at least 10-15 times, I've soured on it completely.  It's barely a step up from Munchkin, and not a very interesting step at that.

If the Red Dragon were replaced with a Bronze Tedium or an Electric Boredom, the game design would make a lot more sense.

I really like the oriduction quality of Fantasy Flight Games and this is no exception!

The inclusion of miniature pawns was a nice touch even though they are replicas of those found in other FFG games.  

The artwork on the dungeon tiles is very detailed and adds to the theme greatly.  Looking at the game, it is pretty impressive.

The game play, however, isn't as exciting as I hoped it would be.  I played a total of 4 games and each one played out about the same, which made the replayability factor relatively low.  To say the least, I am disappointed.

Maybe a few house rules could really spice this game up, but on its own, Drakon is lacking.

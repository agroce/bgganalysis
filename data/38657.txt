Quick multi player solitaire game - take it easy plus meeples. A good filler.

RATING: 9
There is a great deal to like about this title. First, it's inexpensive and has a lot of replay value. It CAN get the feeling of being the same thing after a while, however it is not a show-stopper, as trying to optimize your city in each play always forces you to make a variety of interesting choices.

Second, it is a game that can be played solo or with many others, depending on the number of copies you have -- without losing anything. In fact, with more players, there is more of a challenge in my view.

This is a brilliant gem from Martyn F.

Excellent, quick abstract.  Ignore the "levels" in the rules - just use all of the scoring parts (level 3), it's really not complicated.  Reminds me of Take It To The Limit but shorter, sweeter, and more flexible due to meeple placement/movement (which, in turn, determines what scores for you).  Strongly recommended, very accessible.

Great introductory game! I love the scoring variants. Level 1 could be for those "Yeah. I play board games. I have Monopoly AND Yahtzee!" friends that we all have. Could also be good for kids. I know my 7 year-old could grasp this game. In the event that more advanced gamers are playing, you could advance the difficulty by using a higher scoring level. Has a Carcassonne meets Sunrise City feel. Played great in a 3 & 4 player setting, did not try a 2 player game.

"Level 1" certainly feels a little too simple, but I look forward to seeing what kind of depth the second and third levels can provide.  I like the short play time and the infinite scalability (with multiple copies of the game), given that everyone takes their turn at the same time.  This is definitely multi-player solitaire, though.  That's a big difference between it and Carcassonne, another classic tile-laying game.

RATING: 7
Nice, pretty much solitaire optimization puzzle game. Similar to Take it to the Limit and such. Quite intuitive rules, third level being "only for die hard puzzlers" seems rather strong exaggeration.

RATING: 6
I never would have guessed I would like a Bingo-like game. But I do, up to some point...

The game forces you to use all the spatial abilities you need in something like Carcassonne, but without the additional element of having your plans turned upside down by other players clever (or sometimes, accidental) gameplay.

The random element here comes, not from the chaos of other players, but from the order in which the tiles show up. Thus, it adds an element of push-your-luck that is rarely present in a tile-laying game.

The result? It's quite enjoyable. Not a game I feel I must play at all times, by far... But I wouldn't mind playing if someone asks. Now, depending on it's longevity, the rating may change in the future.

RATING: 7.2
Really nice tile-laying game where every player is trying to build the most attractive city for tourists. There are three levels of scoring you can use where the first would allow children to play, the second is a bit more complex and the third level makes it a game for real gamers. Still these different scoring systems do not seem far fetched or unnatural. Game has functional components but is not really nice to look at. Gameplay however is really good because all the people are using the same pieces to build rather different cities. If you're looking for player interaction, move on. It's not here.

It's Carcassonne Bingo!  Actually that's kind of an apt description.  One player randomly draws a tile, then the rest of the players play an identical tile to build their own city.  It's an interesting puzzle that I kind of like.  I despise the art, though.  I appreciate that they have tried to put unique buildings on each set so that it looks like you're building a specific city, but the art is so bad it actually detracts from the game.  The other positive thing is that you can scale the complexity based on the experience of the players.  It's a nice way to slowly walk into the full game.  The only other flaw I see with this game is that it is too easy to just look at another player's city and match their choices.  This detracts from the game, and hopefully no one would do this, but it is possible.

Level 1 scoring is OK for people new to German-style board games.  If you're the type reading BGG, though, skip it.  It's simpler than Carcassonne.

Level 2 scoring is good as an introduction for people who have been exposed to other hobby/German games.  Really simple rules, but still some meat on these bones.  It wouldn't have much longevity, though, if not for...

Level 3 scoring.  Here's where it's at, and anyone who has experience with games should move to this after the first learning game.  Wow, what a brain teaser, really gets those synapses firing.  I love it.

You'll probably want to play two or three rounds as in High Score.

RATING: 3.5
Multiple-player solitaire (or true solo) game of tile placement, set collection and puzzle/pattern-building.  Essentially, it's a game like Take It Easy where everyone has the same tile set and places the same tile at the same time, hoping to end with the highest score (thus the best use of those same tiles).  Just a quick filler game of min-maxing that can almost be played in auto-pilot.  Meh!

Have only played the basic version so far, but this is a game of tile laying bingo that only takes a few minutes to play. 

Each player puts own a tile which is split in to quarters and each quarter is one of 4 colours. 

Simple mechanism to score points for contiguous areas of yellow or parks, with terraces scoring for how many areas of water they overlook.

THis may be the best "quick game" out there and one of the most versatile.  It's multi-player solitaire so it scales perfectly from 1 to 4 and with different levels of scoring difficulty will plays well for hard core gamers, casual gamers, and kids.  In addition, the game is compact and very transportable.  I haven't tried it on a plane yet, but i think it would do fine.  Lastly, since it's over in 20 minutes, it's the perfect filler.  The only issue is explaining game takes a little long (5 - 10 minutes) for a game that plays this quickly.  

Keeping for travel compactness and the kids

An ok tile laying game with no player interaction. One of the upsides is you can play solitaire and it is exactly like playing with your friends! The third level of scoring is a bit fiddly and I'm pretty sure I messed it up. Level 2 is most likely the way I will continue to play.

Games play really quickly and components are good. For the money, it was worth the purchase, but I think I'd rather play Carcassonne instead (they fill the same niche).

Actually a very good game. Although there is a strong element of chance in the tile that you get every turn, it is mitigated by the fact that your opponents also get the same tile. Deciding what to score can be very difficult. Unlike in Carcassonne, you can move your meeples to a new tile, but you can also never move them back. This means you need to weigh how many points your tourists will score in their current position against what they may be able to score if you move them somewhere else. I also love that the art for each city is different, not only the monuments but even the terraces and parks. Great game, and a steal for $6 on Tanga!

I brought this game with me on a holiday trip after purchasing it at Spellenspektakel 2008, and found out, to my surprise, that the game is beginning to grow on me in quite a good way. Normally I'm not one for solitary puzzles, but Cities is aparently an exception to the rule. At its heart it is of course a barren min-maxing engine which is quite easily solved, but still it is striking to see that some actually do better at it than others. There is of course no interaction or blocking, but despite that it still seems to work pretty well. This is not a game I would like to play all the time, but as a closing title, or as something to entice newcomers to the world of boardgames...? Bring it on!

[b]Update[/b] After having played with the intermediate and the complete rules, I'm thinking that the intermediate ones are a tad too simple while the complete ones are noticably too complex. This is beginning to affect my playing pleasure because there isn't much of a challenge in the former anymore. Perhaps some of the variants listed [url=http://martynf.com/?Cities:Variants]here[/url] will give me the edge I'm looking for.

[b]Update 2[/b] The author managed to land a contract with a Big Hairy Capitalist Publisher Monster, and was able to sneak in quite a few rules updates too. Perhaps there is now a good intermediate level between the medium and hardest levels of play... Unfortunately the new rules also require new material, so backporting the ideas of the new edition is not likely to happen.

Takes the "multiplayer-solitaire tile selection" mechanism from games like "Take it easy" or "Karuba" and uses it as the centerpiece for a rather complex optimization-puzzle.

SOLO PLAY:

I bought this because you can solo play it. As a solo game it is more of a brainteaser and all you do is strive to get a better score. Many other games better suited for solo play. It plays real fast. I'll have to play with others to see if it gets better. 

Much better with other players but still more of a brainteaser instead of a game.

This was a sleeper hit for me. I did not think much of it at first. Now I really enjoy it. It is a great puzzle game.

Components: Attractive tiles and meeples. Tiles could be improved with iconography that suggests their scoring.

Experience: The theme is fun here; my meeples are sitting about in various plazas, gazing out over the water, taking in the parks. Some tough choices, but mostly just a game of Tetris, trying to find the best place for the drawn tile, without knowing what's coming next. Very light; pleasing.

Cities is a strangely addictive multiplayer solitaire puzzle type game in the spirit of [thing=128]Take It Easy[/thing] or [thing=65990]Don Quixote[/thing]. While I wouldn't break this one out on a game night, it's a great game to play with my girlfriend (who likes this game) or if I have 15 minutes to kill. It's fun and it keeps you thinking. Note to myself: I still have to try the level 3 scoring.

Players are each constructing a city, using an identical tile set, but trying to outscore each other at the end of the game.  Fun, fascinating little filler.  One player mixes their 24 tiles and sets 8 of them aside unseen.  The rest are drawn and announced, one at a time, and each player fishes out that tile from their own set and fits it to their city.  City tiles feature parks, terraces, attractions and water, and scoring pawns are placed on these features to trigger points at the end of the game.  Optionally, pawns can teleport to the new tile, or move one hex across the tiles.  After the 4 x 4 city is finished, points are totaled.   Fun game, over in 15 minutes, and the rules include 3 levels of scoring that increase the decisions and placement options.  Perfect blend of Carcassonne and Take It Easy, but a lot faster than both of those two games.  Excellent.

There is fundamentally nothing wrong with the game.  And it seems quite sound, and it's very balanced with more than 1 player,(does play Solo), cause you use the exact same tiles for every player each turn. (though you could make a house rule for it.)

You can easily make some house rules to expand your city, or use all the title, or play 2 player and use 2 sets of tiles, but after about 3 plays, we were kind of bored with it.  House Rules might add a bit to this game, but it just didn't for us.

Multiplayer solitaire, but it's kinda fun for a quick match. Throw out the 'basic game', as it's not much of a game at all. After a few games, it just feels like I'm better off playing a real two player game, as there is zero interaction.

[1 play]  Nice quick light game, but has enough to it to give you something to think about. I like the tile art and could have endless diversion trying to identify the real monuments.  Definitely gives you that Carcassonnesque feeling of delusional optimism--those moments of "hey, this will be GREAT if we just draw exactly this one perfect tile next.  Oh no, some other tile!  The horror!!!!"

I bought this untried in Essen. My trust in Martyn was fully vindicated, this game is EXACTLY my kind of game. Totally visual, very fast but open and flexible play, some brain burning, but I come out the winner. I totally enjoy the multi-solitaire play in this game, exactly the same as in Take It Easy.

This is a pretty interesting tile laying game, very puzzle like. It plays nicely with any allowed number of players, or solo. It offers lots of re-playability, and a real "obsession factor."

[size=7][i][This is a multiplayer solitaire, I'm considering it just as a solo puzzle game.][/i][/size]

Interesting tile-placing solitaire of optimization based on incomplete information.
Playing with a random subset of tiles helps longevity, as you're never guaranteed to get the tiles you need.

The three levels of play only affect scoring (and strategy, of course), which is good as it helps to introduce new players to the game. You start off with Level 1, where you score only connected areas of the same colour (yellow attractions or green parks); it's easy to teach and it allows you to start optimizing a bit. Level 2 introduces adjacency scoring with terraces (orange), which score for water (blue) areas orthogonally connected from there. Level 3 is all about orthogonally adjacent tiles: attractions score also adjacent terraces, parks score also adjacent waters, terraces score any adjacent parks or waters.

But it's not just that, the multi-level structure also allows players to choose the level they prefer.

The game also [url=http://martynf.com/?Cities:Variants]comes with a few variants[/url], which you can find on [url=http://martynf.com]the author's website[/url].

I have found Level 2 plus the [i]no jumping[/i] variant to be the most enjoyable for me, as it is the right mix of speedy and challenging fun.

Take It Easy meets Carcassonne. Everybody tries to puzzle out the best city for herself with a randomly determined set of tiles and places meeples on certain structures to score points according to how well things fit together.

I suspect the scoring is a little too involved for those who enjoy Take It Easy (especially with the complete rules), and it's still little more than occupational therapy for everyone else.

Only solo, but essentially its a puzzle race game (no player interation).  I think Karuba probably trumps it in this genre, but kept as it does have a zen like solo feel, and a much better option than say Dungeon Roll (Rating 6.543, Dec 16).  UPDATE: To be honest, I no longer solo cardboard game, and this sits poorly between the puzzle race and simplicity of Turbo Taxi, and the more interestingly themed Karuba.  I think I held on to this longer as I got it quite cheap and from an unusual source (back shelves of Games Paradise warehouse sale) and the designer had such a catchy name!  So, expect to be soon gone (Rating, 4.751, April 17).

The tiles have so much irritating junk on them it's hard to make much sense of the city. Nothing ever seems to match up! I feel like I'm just building something broken.

RATING: 7
A great little tile laying game, with quaint and attractive folk art of famous city landmarks.  Cities is ultimately  a multi-player solitaire puzzle, yet the fact that everyone has the same pieces and plays them in the same order creates an interesting experience. Situating tiles in order to outscore your opponents becomes a worthy challenge.  The random element is eliminated as far as how it effects each player differently, but the random tile draw does allow Cities to have longevity in terms of replay.  The fast playing time makes this a winner.

A nice Carcassone-ish tile laying game with a solitaire variant and so many scoring variants that it seems the designer couldn't make up his mind. There is some originality in the design and there is some fun.

This game is not bad.  It's truly multi-player solitaire and more of a puzzle game, IMO.  If we are in the mood for a quick puzzler, we'll pick it up.  It also is a great way to get a whole mess of tiles for prototyping as the game can be had very cheaply on Tanga and Ebay.

This is a Carcassonne-like game where you are laying tiles to build your City and then placing meeples to gain points for various attributes of your city. My first thought on hearing that it could be played in 15-30 minutes was that there couldn't be much to it. But much like another favorite of mine, Genesis, there is more to it than the simples rules imply.  That said, this really is 2/3/4 player solitaire.  But I actually like solitaire type games where you are trying to have the better score than the other players at the table. I've only played on level 3.  I doubt I would ever play on level 1 or 2 unless I was playing with children which doesn't happen too often. This is a great filler for the end of a night of gaming where you just don't have time for something longer.

A multi-player soliatire game like Take It Easy. It has arguably more complex choices since you have to place meeples in different ways to score. However, because you can move those meeples, I would say it is more forgiving than Take It Easy.

Had hoped this would be similar to Take It Easy. A quick playing, puzzle game where everyone gets the same tiles in the same order. Suitable for large groups. I bought 4 copies to use in my classroom, but it fell flat. Scores were lower. There wasn't as much tension as you waited for particular numbers. The decisions didn't seem as interesting. Too many tiles were unhelpful and the choice of where to put useless tiles was not as interesting.

I'll stick to Take it Easy.

Exactly what it sounds like.  Take it Easy + Carcassonne.  If you think you'll like that, then you'll like this.

I thought it was a superb game.  Tons of interesting decisions to be made in a very short time period.

And the idea of around 4 levels of scoring is just silly. We played the "expert" and it was still easy to understand. I could see having another style just for kids maybe, but ~4 is ridiculus.

The actual game play was a blast. All the little optimizations and trade-offs were well highlighted. Every decision was quite interesting.

Just as in Limes. One player draws a tile randomly and all other players find the same tile and everyone adds it to their 4x4 tableau. Each tile has 4 areas that are a combo of park, attractions, terraces or water. You can also place a meeple on an area of the tile you just placed, jump a meeple from another tile to the one you just placed, or move a meeple from any area to an adjacent area (you will be placing about half as many meeples as tiles). At games' end you score for each area where you have at least one meeple. The game is about optimizing your tile lays and meeple placements for points.

There are differences in meeple moving and scoring between the two games. In Cities, meeples can never be placed on water. Also, you can never have two meeples on the same tile. These movement limitations made the meeple management more restrictive and slightly less interesting. Also, without scoring water directly, you only have 3 area-types that you score instead of 4. Cities has a "simple" way of scoring (which is frankly too simple) and a scoring method that relies more on adjacency that is closer to the scoring in Limes. The two advantages Cities has over Limes are strictly physical - it has the components to play 4 and it uses cardboard tiles instead of cards. Other than that, I think Limes is a more nuanced game in both scoring and meeple management. If I want to play 4, I guess I'll keep on the lookout for a 2nd copy of Limes...

Cities could be called "Take it Easy - The Carcassone edition". While both inspirations are games I like very much, Cities is just ok. While a simple game, the rules make it sound more complex and it could need a bit more polish. It looks very amateurish which nowadays even small publishers can avoid. It's short so I'm willing to give this more tries to convince myself if there's skill involved. Our game was so close that I'm not sure about this.

The theme is ridiculous, but the idea is cool - it's quick and provides a bit of challenge.  A nice filler.  I just wonder why the game can't accommodate more than 4 players, it would be nice to have 2 extra sets of pieces.

Tile placement game that feels like a cross between micropul and Silk Road Maker. Don't bother with any scoring but the most advanced one, because there's really nothing advanced about it.

The solo game suffers somewhat from the same phenomenon as for instance micropul and Town Center where you eventually learn just what you want to build (in this case, one huge red-bordered yellow area on one side, one huge blue-bordered green area on the other, and scattered red areas in the green 'n' blue), and gameplay consists of seeing how accommodating the tile selection and draw sequence will be. With more players you get to compare scores at the end, but since the significance of individual moves diverges rapidly from the beginning, there is no meaningful correlation at all left at the end; you might as well [i]not[/i] have been using the same tiles.

The Javascript implementation at the designer's site leaves out the possibility of moving tourists, adding a not insignificant push-your-luck element and an inability to score using terraces on the starting tiles. I'm not sure this is much for the worse.

Think a combination of Take It Easy and Carcasonne scoring with meeple placement.  Meeples on terraces (red tiles) will score for each lake and park that is orthogonally in a line with it until another red or yellow tile stops it.  Meeples on parks (green) will score for each green tile in the field and each adjacent lake.  Meeples on attractions (yellow) will score for each yellow tile in the field and each red tile adjacent.  All tiles must be built in a 4x4 grid in the order called out by the master builder a la Take It Easy.  Personally, the game was fine but I'm content to just play Take It Easy or its bigger sister Take It to the Limit!

Simplicity is nice in a tile laying game. I like this better than Karuba, as far as the same bingo-style manner of everyone using the same called tile number on their personal tableau.

The very definition of multi-player solitaire. Each player builds their own city using tiles; each player uses the exact same set of tiles to build said city. Designed for those who are terrified by the prospect of someone drawing better tiles than them in Carcassonne. Dull.

Great little hybrid of Take It Easy and Carcassonne.  Even though this game doesn't pretend to be anything else, it is still very very satisfying.  A little more than a filler, but not meaty enough to get lost in.  Definitely worth picking up if you are a fan of Take It Easy or Wuerfel Bingo.  I moved my rating up a full point after additional plays.  Excellent game.

This can go from VERY light to a solid medium.  It can be a real brain burner at "Level-3".  With that said, level 3 could be played casually.  I rate it Light-Medium weight because it has that potential, as you try to squeak out every possible point.

A multi-player solitaire game in the vein of Carcassone that plays quickly and has some good decision making.  Everybody will be playing with the same set of tiles so the trick to the puzzle is how to place your personal set of tiles and scoring markers in order to outscore your opponents.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Fun filler. Plays very quickly from 2-4. Libertalia-style tile picking ensures each player has the same hand to work with, yet tableaus diverge quickly, partially because play is not based on what the highest scoring move is right now but guessing what will bring the most bang later, giving it a push-your-luck/risk-management flavor. Enjoyable and cheap to attain. Ordered.

Re-implemented as Limes but not impressed. Limes uses cards instead of tiles, only has components for 2p in the box, costs twice as much. Meh.

I picked this up for $5 at Cancon and have played it a few times already.

I can't say I was blown away by it, but it's okay. In a way it's more like a puzzle solving exercise than a game, but there are some clever design elements to it. It didn’t really grab me (I’m a ‘theme guy’ according to a regular opponent), but I can see what the designer is getting at.

I can see me playing it a few more times to see if it generates more enthusiasm but then maybe trading it away of putting it onto a second hand table at the next Cancon.

Still not sure if this is a'puzzle' or a 'game'...

A perfect 10 minute multiplayer solitaire filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Plays more like a puzzle than a game.  Enforcing that each player plays the same number tile at the same tiem could result in some very similar parks.  We gave up on that and played random draws for each player.  It may be against the spirit of the game, but it played quicker and was more enjoyable for us.  Still, not the most engaging game, but with a play time of about 10-15 minutes and minimal set up, it may find table space as a filler to change the pace occasionally.  It has a solo option, but I don't think I'll ever try it.

[b]Cities[/b] was sold via auction 4/28/17.

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (6 - because the artwork is so horrendous):[/COLOR]

[i]Cities is a pretty good game, but man is it ugly. Gameplay reminds me of Kingdomino without the drafting of tiles, instead one person draws each tile bingo style and then everyone places that number. Scoring is pretty straightforward, but I enjoy visual puzzles so I'm happy to play although I wish there was a bit more variety to scoring [i](out of four landscape types one doesn't score, two score the same way and the other scores a different way).[/i] 

Thankfully both of my critiques of the game are resolved in Limes, which is a re-implementation of Cities in which each of the four landscape types score differently. Also the horrible artwork of Cities has been replaced with better artwork. I am currently trying to find a copy of Limes so I can trade my copy of Cities.[/i] 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A simple game that feels like Carcassonne but it's not. Each player has the exact same tiles and 7 meeples. One player shuffles his tiles and draws one randomly. This is the tile everyone will place. There are 3 types of areas you can score points with. All you have to do is create the largest colored areas that you can. To score for these areas you need to place a meeple on them. As soon as a 4X4 grid of tiles is created the game ends and you score your points. A quick relaxing filler that's enjoyable to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
An interesting mix of mechanisms. The games that I played all ended up with very close scores, and I wonder if this is a weakness and points to a lack of replayability because of a relatively small number of optimal moves.

Very interesting game for 15 minutes of play. A solo puzzle that you play for points. With one box, 4 players can play at the same time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A pleasant opener/closer type game. Each player has an identical set of 24 tiles, each split into quadrants, made up variously of park, water, attractions and terraces. One person randomly chooses 16 of them and randomly flips them one by one, whereupon each player will choose the same tile from their set and add it to their 4x4 grid, trying to best place like-coloured tiles together. Very much like Take It Easy. Areas only score if you put meeples on them as you place, but you can later move meeples to better scoring tiles if desired. There's 3 ways of scoring, but you definitely want to go with the convoluted gamer version where you not only score contiguous areas (with meeples!), but for having the right areas next to each other. A turn is to simply reveal and then go through the options and place, playing the odds on whether the tiles to be later revealed will have the continuation tiles you need to maximise your scoring (again, just like Take It Easy). It's just a little puzzle type game, but it's easy to teach, and to pick up and play, making it a great niche filler.

RATING: 7
"Simple, quick, no-conflict tile-placement filler. Literally Multi-Player Solitaire (which is not necessarily a bad thing). Level 3 turns it into a nice little placement puzzle."

What I like:
- No conflict--TRUE multi-player solitaire
- Simple, somewhat thematic scoring rules
- I prefer the online rules, where meeples can't move
- Seems like a good length-to-randomness ratio

What I don't like:
- The box is needlessly large, and an awkward shape

This is a clever little game, and quite enjoyable solo/online. I haven't played against others, so I'm not sure if that's better or worse. Depending on how I thought they were doing, I might take a gamble or play conservatively. 

I keep forgetting that (unlike Carc, where meeple placements are permanent), you can walk or jump tourists. The official "no jumping" variant sounds cool. 

I would put the weight of the starter game down around 1.2, while the Level 3 rules are probably up to about a 2 weight (due to depth). Solo takes about 5-10 minutes, and it should still go fast with more players, since all thinking is simultaneous.

Cities takes the tile-calling mechanic from Take It Easy and combines it with a tile-laying mechanic that's more familiar to Eurogamers--think Carcassonne.  It takes a little bit to get used to all the different scoring options (the game would really benefit from a good player aid), but once you get used to it, it's surprisingly strategic.  Despite the fact that everyone has the exact same options, you'll never see people with identical boards.  It's a quick game that makes you think.

this is a good fast puzzle game that really can be a brain burner at level 3.  Level 1 is really an intro and level 2 would work well with kids and it a good if you were looking for a more casual solo game like a solitaire.  Kind of a carcassonne spin off with tile placement then meeple placement.  Really good for solo play if your looking for something that sets up very fast and plays quick but has a nice puzzle feel.

Ugly art, strangely obtuse rules for such a simple game, and a feeling like I would never play this voluntarily if I had any other tile-laying game available. (update 8/25/17) Kingdomino proves that this game can be done well and actually be fun.

Dull Carcassonne like waiting and hoping for the right tile type of game. There's movement in the meeples for the word has got around that that there space over there will get you a couple more points - which does improve the game somewhat. I'd play it again, if I had to. That's just me though. If you don't mind abstract games without even a semblance of theme, with an uninspiring seen it before mechanic, then this might be the game for you. For me there was no excitement, no intriguing challenge and no fun - things I prefer in my gaming. On a positive note - it's quick.

Carcassonne meets Take It Easy. Not bad, but not great either. Of course, I'm not a huge fan of Take It Easy.

--- Summary ---
Each player has an identical set of 24 numbered tiles. All but 1, who I'll call "the Caller", organize them in order. The Caller draws 3 randomly. Everyone places those 3 into an imaginary 4x4 grid, touching each other by corners only. Then the Caller draws and plays a tile one-by-one, with other players using their matching-numbered tile, until the 4x4 grid is completely filled in. On each play, you can place a meeple onto part of the tile (they may show some combination of city, cafe, park, and water). After all meeples have been placed, you may move a previously placed one by either picking it up and moving it to the just-played tile, or walking it to an adjacent area of the tiles.

At the end, score VP for meeples (only 1/region scores) in yellow attractions (= # of quarter-tiles + #adjacent terraces), brown terraces (= # visible blue water spaces, with LOS extending in 4 directions until blocked by non-water space), and green parks (= # quarter-tiles in region). Most VP wins; tiebreaker = most valuable single tourist.

Jonathan was right-a cross between a game I love (Take It Easy) and a game I dislike (Carcassone) nets a five rating.  Since both of those games are well-liked, I think most will like it more than me.  Rating could go up a little actually, but that geometric element gets me every time!

Reminds me of Take it Easy, but Cities is much more fun; more choices to make, but less frustrating.

I'd really like to try this game but its just too expensive.

**********EDIT**********

I was gifted this game by my friend Steve K during our visit to England.  My wife loved this game in about 5 minutes and instantly said I could buy it.  Just a few minutes later, my good friend gave us his copy.

This is a great puzzle game which is best at the more advanced levels.  Incredibly difficult to play well because you have to plan for the unplannable and try to remain flexible.


Sold in my Christmas auction 2012.

Unassuming tile-laying game. Players have to create a 4x4 grid of tiles which depict four different types of city attractions. Within these 'tourist' meeples are placed and points are scored depending on the accumulative size of areas and in some cases adjoining attractions. It's a very simple game and to be fair to it there is some depth to the gameplay in regards to the placement of tiles, but overall it doesn't aim very high in what it hopes to achieve and ultimately is quite forgettable.

Alright, this game has quickly shot up my list of top gateway games, or filler games. 

This game packs a whole heckava lot of fun into 15 minutes.  And I'm not joking about the 15 minutes.  With teaching it might bump it up to about 22 minutes.

Because this one plays so fast, you'll have a lot of; 'let's try that again' etc. 

Obligatory statement: This game is a combination of Carcassonne and Take it Easy.  And a very good one.

One of my favorite Tanga purchases. A tile game, sort of a blend of Carcassonne and Take It Easy. Portable, quick, and lots of replay value. Great for any number of players.

Works well with all numbers, but there can be a little more down time between rounds as it is more likely for at least one person to have a difficult decision. The parts are very good quality and very functional, but not appealing. The game is absolutely a meld of Carcassonne and Take it Easy. This one has a little more depth than Take it Easy, but like that game, this is basically a solitaire game. Fun, fast playing filler with a little depth.

Carcassone: Bingo.  I like this game.  It is a true multiplayer solitaire so it has a limiting appeal, but it has a lot going for it.  Multiple paths to victory, dealing with uncertainty, and a good ole fashion euro feel to it.  Its easy as cake to execute a turn, but the tricky part is in the scoring.

Cities is the cross between Carcassonne and Take It Easy that everyone says it is. It’s a 20-minute tile-laying game where everyone places tiles in their own area to build their own little city (a la Alhambra and the separate building of palaces). The hook though is that everyone uses an identical set of tiles, which eliminates much of the luck from the game. You place meeples throughout the restaurants, parks, and other attractions of your city in order to score points at the end of the game, which comes quickly enough since it only lasts until everyone has placed 16 tiles in their city (forming a 4 by 4 grid of tiles). The scoring is the only obtuse part of the game because meeples score differently depending on which feature of your city they are standing in (i.e., which color, whether it’s a red restaurant, a green park, or a yellow attraction). The scoring is actually somewhat thematic once you wrap your head around it, but it’s the one part of the game that players are likely to mix up during the game, resulting in potentially misplaced tiles or meeples. It’s a fairly engaging and quick game that serves its purpose beautifully. Cities does a good job accomplishing its goal and filling the niche it aims to fill, but I’m not convinced that I need another 20-minute tile-laying game in my collection. I must say that it is tempting as the gameplay of Cities feels surprisingly innovative despite borrowing so heavily from prior games, but it’s not a game that I feel a need to add to my collection.

Solitaire puzzle. Interesting, but TOO solitaire - each one builds your own puzzle, the one who did better score more points, and that's it. Played once or twice and sent it away.

This is an incredibly fun game for such a small set of tiles per player. If you like puzzles and carcassonne, this will be your game. It manages to merge both themes together in a small and compact game with minimal down time. The length of each game is just about right. I would recommended starting the first game at level two but then immediately move on to the brain burner. It is truly not as bad as it sounds. This game has its roots in take it easy and also connections by Knizia where everyone is building their own set of constructs to maximize point scoring. The theme is somewhat abstract and though I can buy designing the city to attract tourists, London or new York wasn't built in a single day. On a side note, the four cities in play are New York, London, Paris and.........Seattle. Spot the odd one out??  Love the game and more importantly, the wife enjoys it too.

I like the puzzly nature of this game.  It's truly multi-player solitaire, and I appreciate that it doesn't try to be any more than that.  Nice, relaxing family-weight game.  Easy to see why it was SdJ recommended.

My old wishlist comment:"The game does not look good, but it should be good. At least that's what I have read from several sources. It should be fitting for my quite regular two-player game-evenings with my girlfriend."

Yes, after three plays, it doesn't look good, but it is good. I was surprised to learn, that this is a 1-4 player game and not just a duel. Looking forward to play this more in the future.

Keeping the 7 after the first three player play. It ended in a three way draw, which was quite a disappointment. Still, short and simple. looking forward to play more.

Second three player play, I won by one point (2nd and 3rd tied). I like the puzzle thing, but this lacks all the social aspects, I usually wish from the games. Quite mixed feelings, I might be selling this one...

A nice little tile placement game.  It plays quickly.  One might immediately draw comparisons to Carcassonne but the scoring is different enough that it stands on its own.  A fine quick, light tile placement game.

Cities is a short solitaire spatial puzzler. I like it, but am a bit disconcerted at how close scores have been in all my games (in two of my three games there was a tie for the win)

I won't speak on this being a cross between Take It Easy! and Carcassonne, because eleventy-billion people have already made that comparison.  What I will say is that this game is addictive and challenging, plays in a short amount of time, and has a high, high "One more time!" factor.  Of course, I'll bet that the same eleventy-billion people who made the TIE + Carc comparison said the same things, so I suppose I'm being redundant, regardless.  Just play the dang game.  It's a lot of fun.

Accurately described as Carcassone meets Take it Easy.

A pretty interesting design that could get some play because it is short and kind of different.  But, it is not really that engaging or exciting, and therefore will get lost in the big morass of pretty good games out there.

Too bad it didn't get released in the US.  Given that it is hard to get, this one probably doesn't have a prayer of making it.  It's not worth the $39 that Funagain is charging for the import.  If it had a $18 price point, it might find its way into the collection.

The game is a pretty easy game, but it is suprising how every player makes a different landscape with the same tiles. There are many ways to place them next to eachother. Played this one a couple of times, and to me it seems a strategy to try to create one big landscape and place your tourist on that. For example, if you manage a 10 square park and you can place 5 tourists in the park, you will score 50 points. Nice game to play if you don’t have much time, but you want to play a game.

From playing solitaire at http://www.martynf.com/website/javaenzo/CitiesOnline/cities.htm - rating of actual game would differ, due to some rules differences.  From the description of the rules differences, I'm guessing I'd like the real game a little more.  Also, having opponents against which to play "chicken" would help.  :^)

Abstract puzzle tile laying game. multiple solitaire game. Slightly ugly but functional. Play solo as a puzzle game or versus multiple players. Zero interaction or screwage, Players are assigned the same tiles and each makes the most of it on their own city layout.

Can be played over the phone versus people in other areas and it still works.

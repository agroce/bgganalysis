RATING: 9
Certainly worth buying. 15-minute Waterloo can't really have any problems save lack of desire to play, and everyone will be playing this in June 2015. It needs to be played with foresight, bearing in mind the potential significance of modifiers and abilities.

Pretty random in my one game, but also quick. I could see this being enjoyable with multiple plays.

RATING: 9
The most original wargame design I have played in a long, long time.  There are familiar wooden bits on a map, but they don't move; indeed the map is merely thematic chrome.  Cards for each corps are at the heart of the game, giving each unit distinctive characteristics, including its own combat results table.  W1815 really does play in 15-20 minutes and yet it offers plenty of significant decisions, particularly for Napoleon, who must attack Wellington's forces while keeping a watchful eye on the Prussians.  The amount of narrative flavour that is packed into the short playing time is extraordinary.

Production quality is reasonable.  The cards are handsome, but I'm not fond of the map with its blotchy olde paper look.

Comment after two plays. Not sure about this. On the plus side, the map and counters look lovely, and the idea that each corps has its own combat chart to represent its specific situation is very neat. Re-fighting Waterloo in 15 minutes is also highly tempting.
But I'm not sure there are enough possibilities to keep this interesting. On each turn you may activate one corp. If I remember rightly, the Allies have four (five counting the Prussians) and the French six. That's not many options to choose from.

RATING: 7.75
This is a really innovative game which simulates Waterloo in 15 minutes and you  can explain the rules (but not the complexish interdependencies of the cards) in less than 5 minutes.  There are a lot of potentially interesting decisions considering you only have the same 6-8 cards to choose from at most.  Lots of theme.  At the moment playing games without worrying too much about the strategies to explore the cards.  Really get a theme across.  With short playing games I think we sometimes put too much pressure on replayability- but I can easily see this getting dozens and dozens of solo and then competative plays.    If you want to focus on strategic play the amount of rolling dice and having to work out how all the cards interact with each other might detract from the game.  This is a system that could be used to simulate lots of battles and is great for history and those interested in innovative design as well as those who want a quick playing thematic 2 player game.

RATING: 8
The more I play this, the more impressed I am.  After one play, it feels like an enjoyable, short dice romp.  After two plays, I thought there might be something more there but I wasn't sure.  After 3 plays, I was sure and I was enjoying it as a neat little solo play.  Then I added a second player.  It's still short (15ish minutes) and now there's a thinking player on the other side.  

There's no question dice play a large role.  What else can you expect from a 15 minute wargame.  But, there's also room for different strategies depending on how risk-averse you are.  The cool thing is that depending on the dice, you have to be flexible and adjust your strategy as needed.

Current rating: 8 (after 5 plays).

Ingenious. Fast and effective at laying out the issues. To enjoy it you must be willing to accept defeat; this is not for the tearful types. Fast playing, its only downside is you may tire of it faster than a longer game. But you will have played it more times.

I believe the game will be most enjoyed by the historian who will enjoy the possible counterfactuals and generating a narrative. The pure gamer may find it too bare bones.

Gem from Finnish design group.
Tense, 15-minute game which introduces every aspect of Waterloo battlefield in superb straightforward form. Bigger (and longer) games will often not catch those moments properly and with that brilliant twist.
In "short wargame" class definite masterpiece, which I may compare to even brilliant "2 de Mayo".
Great little game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wonderful little number. This is a beer and pretzels wargame that looks great, plays easily, and has enough meat on the bones to keep you interested and busy for quite some time. There are 2-3 major avenues to victory for the French, and a semi-dominant strategy with variations for the Allies, but the dice make each and every game tense. 

To play well do the obvious: understand which type win you are going for, understand your card's CRTs and push where you are ahead. Exploit your momentum, and if the dice don't go your way, go for the hail Mary. Still, don't look for deep strategy here, this is a wargame, thus a dice manipulation exercise.

This system has tremendous potential, I can easily see several different sets of cards representing "paths" in a specific battle, which with low rules overhead could recreate a whole array of different situations.

A magnificent bonsai of a wargame, and a pure, elegant design. Can't wait for more battles in the series.

RATING: 8
An extremely clever, deceptively simple design that can be learned and played in thirty minutes or less.  Despite its brevity and approachability, the game presents historical choices and does a credible job recreating the events, and/or likely what-ifs, of the battle.  Very nice components for a ziplock game, the period-looking map and colorful cards add to the immersion and narrative. Drawbacks are that it’s highly luck-dependent, and may have limited replayability.  Also not ideal for solo play, but this is one game for which it shouldn’t be too hard to find an opponent! Looking forward to what these guys come up with next…

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Well, as it is it doesnt really work great as a game, a wargame or a strategy game. The non linearity of time, and the high importance of the dice luck makes it clunky and not very satisfactory in terms of gameplay experience.

BUT this game is a breakthrough in terms of wargame design concept and it opens a the door for brilliant games down the road using this game concept with more polish, futur will tell...

RATING: 8
A very simple, original take on the Battle of Waterloo.  Two players take on either the French or Allies, and refight the Battle of Waterloo in about ten minutes.  A static map simply is a placeholder for divisions and garrisons - nothing moves, they simply get removed as they take losses.  On a turn, the player activates one of his corps, rolls a die, and actions the result on the corps card.  This may lead to a counter attack opportunity from the opposing side.  Losses are taken in the form of morale and casualties, which can rapidly escalate into taking Rout tests.  A failed Rout test hands the game to your opponent.  

Very clever little system - clean rules, with the narrative of the battle factored into the formation cards.  It is very easy to see this system being ported to other battles, and I expect they are being designed right now (Gettysburg?).

RATING: 7
Very short and my guess is that is why this is popular. It is also well presented and low cost. Each corps is represented by a number of blocks on the map, which don't move and essentially just track health points. Each corps also has a card telling you which unit to attack and what you roll. On your turn chose a card, roll, do the result. Very simple but the game does exercise the die roll results very skilly fully to replay waterloo stories. As a strategy game im not sure there is much here. Its pretty random and doesn't really offer difficult decisions, just obtuse ones. Still at 15 minutes its a steal. Not sure its worth the hype though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A pure chrome wargame where the units on the map never move, where both the map and the units are in fact part of the chrome. You can play this game with a notepad and the cards. No, scratch that, even the cards aren't really needed. What you need are the rules and a piece of paper to mark units, losses and morale. So what you need isn't much, but what this game gives you will have the Napoleonic buff inside you smiling ear to ear. When my gaming partner sighed and said "ok, that's it, my last option is to send in the Guards", we both smiled knowingly that this game rocked.

I really like this game, but I do not quite understand why I like this game.  It is compelling, and I keep trying to understand how it works but haven't yet figured it out despite playing about 10 times now.  Somehow about a dozen cards and around 30 colored matchsticks that don't move on a beautiful map manage to make for a tense, back-and-forth, close game over in 15 minutes or so... *Edit after a few more plays: The game is so well-balanced and quick and suited to multiple replays that I've upped the score from 8.5 to a 9.

I'd say it's the first "cute" war game i played so far.. It's nothing ground breaking & the luck factor is unfortunately pretty high. But it has good components & artwork, plays very quickly & somewhat gives you the impression you're playing a wargame.

A fun little (and I emphasise the word 'little') wargame that re-creates Waterloo in 15 minutes or so. You certainly can't argue with the component quality or the playing time, but I'm not sure how much longevity there is here. There's always a limit on how many times you can refight the same battle before it becomes stale, this system has only simple decisions about which Corps to use, so I think that limit will be reached sooner rather than later. It's also very dicey, so if you roll well, you win. You could argue that about all wargames, it's just a bit more transparent in such a simple system.

Some authors say a short impactful novel is harder to write than a long opus. So it is with wargame design.  These two Finnish designers have captured the central challenges for both sides in the battle of Waterloo in the simplest, most unvarnished manner. And in so doing, they convey the reason why the battle turned out as it did more clearly that a game with hundreds of counters and taking a hours upon hours. They are truly to be congratulated.

Unique and ingenious system, super-fast play, knife-edge feel.

Only concern is how much control the Allied player has over the course of events. He/she seems to be locked into responding to the French moves as best as can be done  and activating Blucher as often as possible. That said, I suspect Old Nosey had a similar experience ...

Though I have many opportunities to play historic (war)games with friends, I've only the most scholar knowledge of history and I'm certainly not much interested in Napoleonic campaigns and battles.

But with this year's bicentennial commemoration of the battle of Waterloo, I took a little interest in it.

This game really has all the historic components to replay the battle in a short time.
The material is great (good looking and of nice quality), rules are simple and a bit of luck allows for the victory of both sides.

A quick fix to whet anyone's appetite of getting into Napoleonic warfare at "that" crucial historical moment - Battle of Waterloo.  Some dices are involved but the command cards play more role in the game.  No movement of the pieces are involved and they are fixed on the positions of the map.  I don't think I like the game system as is but I do appreciate its short playing time - 15 to 20 minutes for the whole battle.  Well, but is it what a wargamer looking for? Or a more causal gamer the target audience?  Definitely the latter. Challenges? Some.  Fun? Yes.  Authenticity?  Light to an extent that it could be any situation. It's not even a chess....

Clever and ingenious as everyone says, but the design really seems to rely on pressure from the Prussians to keep the springs wound and as a result they can enter much earlier than was historically the case. Indeed, typically the black eagle's divisions begin arriving on turn one, and thus "Blucher or night" becomes high noon at Plancenoit. That said, there is so much here that's done so well it seems churlish to complain.

RATING: 8
The most fun that you can have in 15 minutes!

A cleverly designed little game that feels like the actual battle. Sure, there is luck involved but that's true in any small, simple game. But the action/reaction aspect of the game provides real tension. It belies the adage that there is nothing new under the sun.

As Wellington, you are desperately trying to hold on until Blucher arrives. Playing Napoleon, you are sacrificing Lobau's corps, attempting to hold Blucher back, trying to buy enough time so that you can destroy Wellington's army.

The game is great and it presents a very good narrative of the battle.

Update: A victim of downsizing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
So ok it's small, plays fast and looks good. But in all honesty your decisions are limited and don't really matter all that much. The lack of movement, positioning and all that means that it's entirely reliant on statistical analysis of what the odds will be, which to me is the least interesting element of any wargame.

A beautifully crafted game--part puzzle--part push your luck--and, most importantly, part strategy.

This is a terrific little game! It is innovative, tense, and quick playing. It is a superb game in its historically accurate portrayal of the battle, beautiful looking, and just plain fun! The biggest knock I can make on it, is that bad dice rolls can undo the best strategical decisions to a greater degree than in many of other Waterloo games I have played. Of course it takes only 15-20 minutes to play. So several games can be played in one sitting, with an almost sure guarantee to provide a very satisfying gaming experience.

Quick-playing so easy to have a starter/nightcap game for 2P.  

Knowledge of the battle will add to the narrative, but enjoyable without that knowledge.  Suspect game likely to encourage those who haven't studied the battle to read about it.

RATING: 9
Simulates the major decision points of the battle of Waterloo, and the grinding attrition of men and morale leading to one side's collapse. The process is ruthlessly abstracted so that each attack is resolved with a single D6 roll.

In computer science terms, the game is a finite-state automaton. The game state is represented by who controls the three key strongpoints (Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and Plancenoit), the formations' strengths, and which side of the formation cards are up. No movement is necessary; that saves a lot of playing time. Brilliant!

A model for battle games to come, no doubt. I enjoyed trying out the different cards and was starting to get the gist of more optimal moves into my third play. Ney's cavalry charge was quite a tense experience, as is watching the tracks fall, hoping you're the one to win the near run thing. 

I wonder, if and when people figure such things out, if moves will become formulaic and so lead to hammers. Maybe not, the luck is pretty high and the designers clever and obviously good at math!

And it is overpriced. This could be a pencil and paper game and I wish it was, although the components are nice.

Would be interesting to play where each card had to be used in succession in some fashion/frequency, apart from reserves and commanders.

A very enjoyable, very fast playing game.

Not a lot going on, but still enough that you have to think about which unit to active.

An incredible achievement to create a Waterloo game playable in 15 minutes! A very innovative system which mirrors the history with passable accuracy given the high level of abstraction. Fun to play, and if you're unlucky with the dice, just start again and and have another try. Very clever game.

The gameplay is entirely with cards and dice. The pieces on the map are to keep track of progress; they do not move but are removed as casualties are inflicted. Probably will be considered light and random by heavy wargamers, but it is quick fun and well worth trying.

Juggling the interactions between all of the cards is fun and exciting. For the most part, I don't even miss the maneuvering of troops on the board. It plays quick, which makes the sometimes lucky swing of the dice less painful. You can always set up another game and try again. On repeat plays, the subtle strategies emerge even if I worry that there is limited replayability given commonly executed strategies that depend very much on the luck of the dice.

Oh, boy, did I got surprised by [thing=175360][/thing]! It is a truly simple wargame: each side does a single action, whose result usually is resolved by a single die roll - and this normally do casualties or lower the moral for one or both sides. Play goes like this until the lost of troops lead to an automatic retreat of an army, or when the moral roll for one side fails, also leading to retreat of an army. Yet, this gives doesn't give the winner (of the battle, sure, but, say, not of the war).

And the mechanics, in spite of being highly efficient in producing a dynamic play environment, fun and interactive, that allows for decisions each turn, aren't what impressed me the most. This feat goes to the thematic care that I saw: the great simplicity of the game didn't came at the expense of making it mostly abstract or absurd towards its theme. Some compromises had to be taken, yes, but, overall, the direct and short rules actually works to bring the theme to the forefront: from the late arrival of the prussian army; passing by almost personal dispute between some corps of the opposing armies; the envolviment of three key locations - La Haye Sainte, Hougoumont and Plancenoit; the reactions of some parts of the army due to the actions of others (such as the 1st Corp, under Orange's command, forming a square and giving advantage to D'Erlon); and other delicious tidbits of historical theme. Even the way scoring works has thematic reasoning.

Overall, [thing=175360][/thing] was a sensational find - from opening, to playing and putting it away, it will take around 20-25 minutes, while giving varied options for both side throughout the play. Yes, it has low complexity and luck in the die rolls - still I see these more like a feature, in order to keep the game light, agile and without worries, just plain fun. Highly recommended!

Felt very much scripted and on rails

You could throw a die and let the French win on a 6, draw on a 5 and all other outcomes are a British win. 

Not much fun.

Got this yesterday. First play took a bit of working out which actions to take but quickly got the hang of it and works very well as a system with momentum around successes meaning the opposition has to react rather than do their own best strategy. So really gives a good feel for a battle developing and the momentum switching. For the price and the very short length of game it really is incredible value and delivery far more than much 'bigger' games

My blog is about miniatures but I have done a review of this game:

Strange and audacious wargame without movement, with static division matchups, and also dice heavy.  Yet, it's a deeper game than that suggests.  Multiple avenues are available for deciding where to create weak points and applying pressure to weak points.  Timing of actions is crucial for the determining who dictates the action.  Although the division matchups are static and without movement, there is a great looking map (with units and casualty & morale tracks) that helps visualize the Battle of Waterloo.  A die roll can steal a game, but plays have been mostly close to the wire.  Belying its simple rules and very short playtime is an engrossing wargame with a great aesthetic.

Some new releases appeal to wargamers because they're completely different, not because they're particularly satisfying.  W1815 may be one of those things.

True, the game allows two opponents to decompress after a long night (or full day) of wargaming, but unless you exclusively purchase wargames there are better options.  On the 2p filler scale, I'd rather go with Martian Dice, Star Realms, or a 20-minute session of Star Wars Risk.  They're the same price, or much cheaper, and (to me) more interesting.

Though I've discovered that W1815 has special appeal to aficionados who admire W's masterful reduction of the real battle to a 10-minute game.  As such, it might even deserve to be displayed in the Hall of Gaming Milestones.  I'll be playing something else, though, while y'all are at the museum.

I'm one of those wargame theorists who believe there are wargames and there are consims (or conflict simulations). or games where there is a historic narrative or reenactment that enable the battle to play out in your mind as a way to study history. If you said it was possible to create a consim narrative in under 30 minutes I would have said no way. This game's done it in 15. Brilliant. A game changer. Bring on the follow up designs!

Dice-rolling luck fest. Pick a card, roll a die, resolve its effects. 

Low decision making. I could not see where the strategy was, considering all your doing is picking a card and resolving its effects.  

The only one I could see was to pick a card that gives you the least amount of causalities and gives out the most potential damage.   Virtually of the time that was the "Grand Battery", if this is the case the game just plays itself. 

Did not like this game at all.  But it is fast though.

Played several times. It's a simple wargame reflecting a deep understanding of elegance in strategy games that celebrates dice combat. Lovingly crafted, well balanced (except for misfortune in random tile placement) all from an amazing Indie game designer. The tiles could really use a face lift and the reference card needs work. The game can wind on too long although there are alternate hacky endings - e.g. everyone roll a die each turn and when all roll a 6, the game ends? But still, I respect the effort and enjoy the experience. Well done!

It felt like a vastly improved Risk - I hope it does not suffer from the comparison.  I liked how your forces are dependent on your building choices, I like the strength of combined arms over massed arms, I liked how turtling is not rewarded, I liked the variable terrain's effect on strategy and tactics, I liked the implementation of ships... I liked how Mr. Morrison fits a lot of wargame elements into a simple package with intuitive gameplay so I get into the theme but not bogged down in mechanisms (the bits are nice too, though the board reminds me of a country quilt).  There may be some imbalances depending on the advantages of the terrain you happen to start on, but terrain imbalance in a light wargame with a variable board does not bother me at all.  If my rating isn't higher, it's because there's just not that many people I'd enjoy playing this type of game with (but that's me, not the game).

A good game when you need a quick fix of seemingly thousands of figurines, agressive combat, and dice. It definitely fills a niche with our group.

The game is incredible well made. It really shows the quality of "Made in US" when it comes to the plastic figures.

The game play might be a bit heavy for a game based this much on luck. But after a while all rules are understood. A two players game might be too small, and it doesn't help on the luck. So a bigger board might be in place.

The game is fun if each player is playing without thinking for their victory. (How ironic)

RATING: 5
Plays incredibly fast and leaves a lot of room for intelligent tactical play, but player elimination issues and large luck dependence limit it's fun factor.  

My luck complaint stems primarily from tile draws (dice don't bug me anymore).  The terrain that you draw to surround your capital or your key cities can make or break it's defensibility.

RATING: 6
Tentative rating after one play.  My rating will probably go up.  Played with 9 players on the board and this is too many as the starting positions effectely put 3 of the players out of the game immediately.  Also played with the subjegation rule which we good to experiment with, but won't be trying again.  Player elimination in these situations is actually more straightforward  I think that the Vassal rule makes the game play slow down and detracts from the games virtues.  This is a game which rewards attacking and as a result defense and civ building get short shrift.  For me this game may focus too much on attacking and not enough on civ building.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Decent game, more interesting because of the labor of love taken to bring this game to market. Rules are overly complex for a typical casual games group. Interesting mechanics, but not much for two players. Probably not even much for three players. Like Duel of Ages, a whole lot of "wanna", but hasn't crystallized as a go to game.

RATING: 8
Six-player set; a version for up to four is also available.  Nice components, easy to learn and teach.  Good introductory game.  Works from solo through six (pieces are hard plastic and can be easily painted, so more players can be accommodated if desired with additional bits).  Force composition and size is limited by terrain under friendly control.  Some interesting movement rules make game play highly mobile.  The game plays more quickly than first impressions might suggest.  Good online video tutorial offered at the web site.

RATING: 5
If you can avoid the round-robin of each player repeatedly attacking the leader and thus ending in stalemate this would get a higher rating from me.

Nice game component wise for publisher size.

I like the game a lot. My son picked up on the rules rather quickly, and he is only six years old. I look forward to further plays. One of the funnest parts of the game is the exploration, but I also like the combat mechanics. You can't just make a hoard of infantry and use it to battle into your enemy. You need to be smart about it. That's why I like this game. Also, the economic choices you make are important as well. I like some of the rules that mitigate luck and provide for metropolises. 

I also like the miniatures quite a bit. As one who likes to paint Risk miniatures, I have decided to buy an extra set of these and paint them for a different miniature game. They are relatively cheap and would make a nice (read cheap) 15mm Napoleonics army.

This game was exactly what i needed for group night.  It's a lot of fun, full of conflict and due to the way that you get new units, they recycle back from being destroyed fairly quickly (unless you're losing cities). The variable endgames allow easy adjustment of playing time, the doomsday clock is currently our favorite.  An expansion would put this over the top.

This game has just about every aspect in a game that you could want, as difficult to master as chess, the rules are easy to learn and better yet easy to remember, good game interaction and replayability. It also lends itself to house rules. The one draw back for the gronard it is not a recreation war game. Oh do I forget the game components no I just haven't found the right words for how good this game looks.

Per Michael Barnes:
"The combat system is smart, quick, and unbelievably brutal. I thought it was favor the attacker too much, but well-defended positions turn into total bloodbaths. The versatility of artillery and frigates can't be underestimated and the combined arms thing works pretty well."

The random hexes may ruin a player's game if he is unlucky. The rules could have been written more clearly with better organisation. I can't see this being played too often in my gaming groups. I don't understand why all the reviews rave about this game. Downgraded to 4 from my initial 6.

A Risk killer.  Good game, but with limitations on its "goodness", due to length especially.  Games can drag on in an effectively near-stalemated position for a tediously long time.  Clever mechanisms in general but sometimes (often?) the whole seems a little less than the sum of it's parts.

Dozens of gbe plays. Fun game with modular board and nice combo of Risk and AnA with combined arms combat.

First player has an advantage, and once you fall behind there's an almost nil chance you'll recover against a decent opponent. Your only chance is to convince everyone else to form an alliance to take down the leader.

Still, evenly matched games always snowball one way or the other and rarely change direction.

Great light wargame with meaningful strategic decisions. Good for 2 or more than two, and I've even enjoyed a solitaire game on occasion (playing both sides of a 2-player conflict). Read my review for more description and opinion. :)

[EDIT: After many plays, I find that flukes in conflict resolution happen a little too often for my taste. Perhaps the variant described [url=http://www.viktorygame.com/blog/2007/02/10/viktory-ii-expansion-rule-determining-hits-with-dice/]here[/url] will fix this.]

2014: I haven't played this in some time, and would like to revisit it, using the most recent ruleset - it seems to improve a number of things.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
A clever system for allowing exploration and conquest of an unknown, geomorphic map, with the possibility of islands, peninsulas, etc.  The system "balances" itself away from "turtling", by tying the number of combat units one can have, absolutely, to the number of towns and cities one has.  However, IMHO, the number of units supportable seems a little bit too Draconian, rendering most battles as make-or-break affairs, while placing the player in the almost-impossible position of trying to expand, while protecting his rear-echelon assets in a game favoring maneuverability.  The sum of these factors is (again, IMHO) a bit too much reliance for my comfort of the outcome of the game on the outcome of each battle.  Have considered increasing the number of combat units each settlement can provide.

The figures are high-quality and hard plastic (unlike the soft stuff made popular by Eagle games), and the board components include an interlocking "frame" for holding the hex tiles together in all the possible sizes for a given number of players.  

Whatever else is said, the designer has published an larger-scale exploration-and-conflict game easily playable in two hours or less, and that is nothing to sneeze at.

RATING: 7
Generally speaking, this isn't the type of game that thrills me.  But for what it is, it's pretty good.  Attacking isn't as damaging as it is in some other games, so people don't (and really can't) just adopt a defensive posture.  You only really hurt someone when you take their town or city, so attacking tends to be the order of the day.

RATING: 6
This game has everything going against it as far as a game that caters to my interests. It is random, chaotic, lacks history or narrative, and is a free-for-all. Despite these facts, the designer worked out every other kink to make it work really really well. If I can be talked into a free-for-all, this is the one I'll choose. The rules to everything possible to encourage attack and discourage "turtling", and every turn you re-build the units you lost. So you might as well use 'em!

As a life-long wargamer, I wasn't really expecting to take to this game.  One play, however, proved how wrong I could be.  About as complicated as Risk, but way more FUN!!!

I highly recommend this game.  Rules are easily grasped, by even my 8-year old.  Nevertheless, the rules have depth, and there are clearly several viable winning strategies.  The size of the map is very important.  Smaller maps demand different cautions than do larger ones.  The bits are great, and plentiful. I look forward to many, many games of Viktory II.

I like this but my group is not so enthusiastic. I think maybe the biggest problem is lack of chrome, it is so streamlined it actually ends up becoming a bit bland and abstract. Also, inevitably in the first few games someone will make a mistake that will cost them the game and the fact that one mistake is all it takes might put them off. It is a shame because the game has a very nice system that awards aggressive play and really is a big step up from risk etc but somehow it does not excite and other games get picked constantly over this with my group.

Rating is based on 2 plays of this game.  A much better game experience than Risk which it resembles as it features units with unique capabilities.  Like Risk it has a similar method of conflict resolution, and in that regard it cannot be argued that bad die rolls at key points in the game can be devastating.  Cardboard hex tiles and borders are too thin...it seems that a very similar game experience could be had with a lot fewer, but thicker cardboard components.  I had the unfortunate situation to be virtually eliminated from contention after the first hour but having to participate without any hope of victory for an additional 2 hours...ouch!  I am not a fan of this genre so my opinion must be seen in that light, but I would've much rather played a couple of eurogames in the same amount of time spent playing a 3 hour Viktory II.

RATING: 6.5
A nice distillation of all those other expand & conquer dice grinders that you like (liked?) to play, with the advantage of a few new ideas that encourage the game to reach completion in a reasonable amount of time. The "combined arms" rule and relative low unit density create wars of maneuver more than of attrition, while the combat rules and the timing of reserve placement prod players to attack at just about anything approaching even odds. Longer (of course) with more players, but the multi-player dynamic is welcome here, as two-player games are prone to irreversable momentum thanks to the the capture of towns and cities, which cause one player's forces to swell while the other's are diminished. The little rules distinguishing between cavalry, artillery, and ships lend a tolerable degree of period feel, and as a bonus it is fun to gradually reveal the map through exploration. The random maps can create imbalanced situations but they are just as likely to create unique objectives in terms of that one crucial hex everyone fights over to get an edge in a critical resource. Better by laps than any of the over-produced and under-developed designs that I played from the defunct Eagle Games. Recommended if you like this kind of game, and might even be worth a look if Risk and Axis and Allies are games you used to enjoy but have reluctantly set aside as your gaming time diminished and your tastes became more refined.

Played twice both 2 player. I just can't get this game to the table. We are not really wargamers and even though I try selling this game as a light and fun distraction from the usual euros they ain't buying it and so it stays on the shelf. My 2 player games have been rather lame really just rule learning sessions. Much as I want to have a 2 or 3 hour slog with 6 players it is not going to happen. I appreciate the time the designer has put into Viktory II and I wish the game well. June 09

RATING: 6
I'm quite impressed. This game manages to be exactly what I always was looking for in a Risk replacement. More strategy, meaningful decisions, uncertainty in the map exploration phase, and interesting dynamic bottlenecks.

There's potentially quite some imbalance in how the tiles are placed, and of course the dice and their luck are tremendously important, but I can live with that - in fact, it's what makes me like the game even more because it brings it full circle back to Risk, but with a much more balanced combat system with more meaningful decisions.

RATING: 9
Excellent game.Viktory II mixes combined arms (attack strength increases with the variety, as opposed to the sheer number, of forces) with the idea that you can develop certain kinds of units only if you occupy certain kinds of terrain on a modular map/board that changes each game (and, if you use the new rules, the map is even slightly modifiable when players first explore it in the course of the game, which adds a new level of strategy). Beautiful to look at. 

I play with the new rules (advanced rules aka expansion rules). The rules are mostly about movement and combat, so they become intuitive (even to first time players) after a few rounds and allow for fast play and a focus on the contest. It is a balanced and action packed game. 

The maneuvering is quite fluid and flexible. The dice rolls can add brutal excitement. The tactical play -- which can get quite complex, given the variety of options that can be present in any situation -- is delightfully light in arithmetic (there are set determinants for successful attack or defense) but more positional and logistical. The modular board will make for high replayability. Very fun.

As with all "conquer the world" kind of games, it is vital that players engage in some metagaming to coordinate a shift of momentum away from the leader. Of course, the "leader" can shift -- as can *perception* of who the leader is. Players who get hammered early in the game especially need to get busy with some diplomacy ("don't attack me -- you'll only help the leader!"). This helps address one concern with the game: if someone gets hammered very early, it is possible that he or she will never recover. Again, I think diplomacy can work in this situation. I am also working on a variant to address this issue. Either way, a player needs to be a good sport to hold the weakest position over the course of a game -- and people need to be socially and psychologically flexible to engage in metagaming without losing sight of their primary objective, which is to try to come out on top.

The first player to successfully attack in a two player game will likely win -- unless you use a 3-player board, which allows each side to build up a more stable force before engaging. 

[u]Addendum:[/u]
I have never played with the victory condition of sacking all other capitals. I've only played with the 'race for dominance' condition: the first player to 20 points wins (or 15 points for a quicker but slightly premature ending). I use the new rules (rules for more balanced combat, pillaging, metropolises, combat supply). I also use the terrain mapping rules (choose the arrangement of tiles when you explore them) which makes the early game much more interesting. I find the game works best with five players because the diplomacy is more dynamic with an odd number.

I prefer VII to Nexus Ops (I find the secret objectives in the latter somewhat gamey).

RATING: 6.5
Played at Salt Con.  This game really has a ton going for it.  The world exploration, length, unit differentiation are all interesting innovations in the dudes-on-a-map genre.  The issues I have are that there is a rich-get-richer effect with units being tied to settlements and that initial placement of settlements allowing for future growth may in fact determine the overall course of the game, ala Settlers.  The exploration factor mitigates this as its impossible to know which spots will end up being important at the start, but it might really turn me off after more plays.

Played 2P (30 min) and 6P games (2.5 hrs w/ short game--play until one capital is conquered and add up VP for towns and cities).

Excellent game that comes from an independent publisher exactly as described. The game performed exactly as described. Light and fast like Risk, with a decent logistics/economics system, quick yet brutal combat system (but not unlike Axis & Allies) and fun exploratory phase in the early game. The totally random and hidden map layout is novel where each player experiences the feeling of exploring the unknown world (and is half the fun), much like the computer game Strategic Conquest. Combat emphasizes variety of units versus sheer number, with simple terrain effects. Combat system leans toward aggressive behavior, yet defender still can inflict heavy losses on attacker. Units regenerate after being destroyed in combat, adding further incentive to attack. Only way to reduce enemy units is to conquer the towns and cities that support them. Movement is straight forward, and the inferred road movement between towns/cities is brilliant. Game was well received at a wargamer meetup. The fact that this game can scale and accommodate between 2 to 8 players is simply amazing.

The plastic units are top notch and well detailed. Everything comes in a profusely large number of zip-loc bags. Cardboard hexes are already cutout. The game is ready to play, right out of the box! Rules are clear in classic wargaming x.x.x format. No shrinkwrap, however, but this is a fantastic value for the money.

Update (10/10/11): Most of my gaming group are not grognards, so this does not get much play lately. However, the plastic units are perfect for Struggle of Empires! Downing to an '8' from '9'.

Good game, but not as good as I hoped.  Multi-player games can definitely drag because of constantly shifting alliances (i.e., Players A and B will gang up on C, but then B will backstab A and help C, then afterwards C will backstab B).  The balance of power is too easy to maintain, and no one will accept a "shared" victory.

Great game. Fast, simple, and very strategic. Random map setup allows for different play every time. The pieces are gorgeous, very nicely done. 

I bought the game and have loved it. This was the first time I had heard of a person self producing a game himself. I have read his history of making it at least 3 times. A lot of info there. I was very impressed by his effort. Now, I see that a lot of people self produce games, but Peter Morrision did it large scale, and left pages of info on how he did it. I admired that.
(http://www.viktorygame.com/viktoryiihistory/)

The components are top notch. He made the tiles himself . (I see them, and say Wow! Very top quality.) And the pieces were produced according to his specifications. Not like the flimsy plastic Eagle game puts out, but strong stuff. The detail on them is really neat, especially the frigates. People play with them all the time while we are playing. The rules and player aids are in B+W though. You can easily print some nice aids though from BGG in color, and mount them if you have a mind to do that.

Exploration is very fun, seeing how the map turns out. We always remark on little features of the map. Peninsulas, islands, bays...

I like that you don't produce units every turn, which rewards those who sit back. In this game, there are heavy benefits to attacking. Lots of it. You get bonuses for types of troops, not troop number. All these little mechanics fit together very nicely and create a very enjoyable game.

Key points I like:
Exploration - New map every time, plus the fun of finding it out slowly.

Unit Production - Tied directly to city/villages. Each building "supports" units (no, you don't keep track of each one's "home towns").

Battles - Unit types count, not amounts. (ok, more infantry = more cannon fodder, but they don't each get to roll as in A+A).

Simple - Each unit has a few key abilities, very simply done. (Cavalry move 3, 2 dice attack, Artillery have opening shot, and Bombard, Frigates transport, bombard, move 5)

I'm really glad to own this game.  Apart from being really nicely produced (especially for a self-published affair), it's got simple but deep gameplay which scratches the "Risk" itch which being much more controllable.  Solves the Turtling problem of wargames very nicely and plays well with 2-6.

Think of this as the Battlefields of Catan and you won't go far wrong. Units are tied to towns and cities so there are no casualties as such, the dead simply reappear in your off-board 'reserve'. The game is designed to favour attack, but a well defended city in difficult terrain is tough to capture and a lucky defender may hold out many times. If you don't like dice, stay well away.

Have played several 2 player games along with some 3 player and 4 player games. 

This is a FUN tense game. You never seem to have enough units to guard yourself on all fronts and conduct an offensive so you need to position your units carefully.

On the 2 player map I had my son on the ropes and almost had him in one game but he managed to win a crucial battle and it was all down hill for me after that.  We ussually play 2 player games on the 3 player map because it it more forgiving if you lose a city.

The game has several clever mechanisms, but just seems to miss the spot for me.  There isn't enough to the game play to make it attractive to me as a 2-player effort. On the other hand, the victory conditions virtually ensure that multi-player games will become exercises in cyclical leader-bashing.

This is a nice, light wargame with some interesting mechanics, however my overall feeling is that if I'm going to play this, I'd rather play a real wargame.  I also don't like that if a player is out of this one early, he may have to sit around for 2 hours waiting for others to finish.

RATING: 9
Based on two plays with one other person, I am impressed.  There's a lot of drama in uncovering the terrain hexes.  There's also a lot of randomness -- in the second game, we made sure there were an equal number of each terrain type to make it a little less random.

Despite the relatively simple rules, it has flavor.  There could be an inland sea, or a mountain range, or a great forest.  Whatever the terrain, little colorful units will soon be sprouting up and battling one another.

There seemed to be a fairly big advantage to moving first.  Next time we'll try playing one size bigger.

An alternative take on the wargame genre. It has some clever mechanisms, very detailed plastic pieces, and a scalable map for different numbers of players. Its a middle weight game and my non-gamer friends managed to learn it without much difficulty. Downtime was a tad on the long side, but the game was fairly engaging.

On my first play, I would've rated the game a 7. Now, its probably a 6. The problem I see with this game is that once players are equally experienced the game comes to a bit of a standstill. Essentially it becomes a bash-the-leader game. Whenever someone starts to make a grab for new cities, everyone else just gangs up against that player. The map/set up is just too balanced and same-y game after game.

Its still a clever little wargame with some intriguing ideas, but with experienced players will drag on for a long time.

I'm not a fan of Risk so this didn't do anything for me.  I felt it was a blend of Risk meets Entecker.  It's an opportunistic roll-your-dice wargame. While the terrain hexes creates a little exploration excitement, it's not balanced at all from a design/play standpoint.  You basically build on whichever hexes are available.  It's also a wargame that could typically allow a follow-up (second) attacking player an avantage to winning a game when the initial attacker did all the work to dwindle an opponents forces.

Lots of fun and quite a challenge to make the right initial exploration and building choices and then play well to stay in the game! It seems to be fun at all levels of players (though 5+ will take awhile) and I like that the game scales well between different numbers. Also, the rules are very tight, giving you aggressive options while not making it a cakewalk either!

Interesting game. The box says it all: A fast-paced game of strategy and conquest. It can be played in less than 2 hours or more if you want, depending on the victory conditions you select from the rules. Unforgiving and aggressive. Very fun. The rulebook is (and the rules are) far from perfect, but the rules are OK with small adaptations. Recommended if you like it simple, aggressive and fast..
Another downside: it is abstract.

Doomsday clock variant recommended for 5-6 players...

Don't know about this one--the game starts slow and the 1st half hour is just building up your economic base.  Hexes are uncovered very quickly and it's quite fiddly turning them over in a tight space and keeping the board cohesive.  In a 4 player game I ended up subjugated but only after being reduced to 2 cities which left me hamstrung for the last hour of the game.  Is quite long for what it is--the game took 3 hours but with experience will probably settle in at 2 .  I like the way the units combine and interact but play was on the boring side and we were all glad when it was over.  I'd try it again but won't suggest it.

Upped my ratings after many more plays.  Components are top-notch.  Rules are are short and cover everything clearly, although occasionally the order of presentation is a little unpredictable.

Plastic Napoleonic armies and cardboard hex-based tile game.  Dice for combat.  Replayability comes from the variable map and multi player options.  Basic game is sound and attacker friendly and relatively short (assuming players concede rather than fight to the last town).  Game combines familiar elements from games like Age of Imperialism, Euro tile laying games, Axis and Allies and so on...but is very simple.

Basic game rewards quick thinking and decision making, as the map unfolds the players who take advantage of the strategic shape of things will likely gain an early edge that will be hard to beat.

I would like to see some modern expansions!

Based on one play: A basic fighting game where you must build towns and cities that determine your supply limit and let you expand your unit count, but based on the terrain type, you can support different types of units. Since your attacks are based on different unit types, you want to diversify. By the third round, everyone is close and battles begin, but the are short. Simply and fairly quick for a game of this type.

1 play - 5 player

Rules are organized but not arranged for clarity. We missed a few rules and had trouble getting started. Still, it is an interesting set of interlocking mechanisms and even though there are dice, they are tempered in their effect. One significant battle was decided across two players turns when the first came up empty on a four dice roll and the other on his turn counter attacked and gained a four dice, four hit, roll taking a key city which was strongly fortified.


Has run away leader issues which depend on other players picking at the leaders weak side before they can deploy. Does balance the poor person who loses that first city and then quickly loses more with the reduction in threat and the flanking attack by the other neighbor.


Random tile layout and tile to unit manufacture relationship makes the game work. The board is quickly crowded but the end game isn't decisive enough so this first play dragged on. We arbitrarally declared one last round and the score was close. Would benefit from pulling a card from a deck of cards at the beginning of the turn with the fourth ace causing the game to end instantly. This would limit play to 12 turns which is enough for what this game is.

The core of the game is the same as the original Viktory.  The new game is characterized by better bits, including original military pieces (the charging cavalry piece is my favorite), and rule changes based on player input on the original Viktory.  Rule changes of note include an exploratory initial phase where the random map is revealed, terrain defense and movement modifiers that subtly change the combat but do little to slow down the game, and minor tweaks to the movement and replacement schemes.  The additional rules make the game slightly more complex, but Viktory II remains an aggressive game where turtling is pointless and thoughtful positioning of cities and units on the random map is rewarded.

Very surprising; an ugly duckling that turns into a swan.  Elegant outsider game.  Only random terrain -- which is also a positive as the game situation is radically different each play -- keeps this game from a ten as it *can* cause a disadvantage.  Game plays more quickly and more interestingly than its peer group.

Also: at least one of the low ratings of this game is due to a geek at my table getting totally, embarassingly spanked in his first -- and only! -- game.  (Afterwards, he was stoked that we could finally play "Chez Geek.")

Lots of things I like in this game.  Armies are tied to cities - so control of land is key.  Rules don't really allow turtling - or hunkering down and letting a large army build up in a city.  One needs to expand to get more resources.  Combined units helps balance development.  Battles losses just go into reserve to return to the game - so attrition is a key tactic.  And it plays quickly compared to other conquest and control games (Attack!, Risk, Axis & Allies).

I definitely enjoyed my first play, and look forward to playing more, including trying out some of the new rules from the designer's blog.

UPDATE - I've played a few more times, and I simply love playing this game.  It's nasty, brutish and short, and I wouldn't want it any other way.  You get a lot of tactical bang for very little brain overhead.

I'm not a wargamer and this was explained to me as "not really a wargame". But there's a lot of dice rolling to determine your fate ... and that doesn't appeal to me much.

Need to give it another go 'round for sure.  It felt somewhat like I was just spinning my wheels without much actual progress -- lose a unit, get it back, lose a city, take another -- with the outcome of the game more or less dependant on your initial terrain availability and the whimsy of the dice.  Great idea with the modular board and everything, but I think it needs a bit more -- or maybe less.

Rating after only one play, so take with a grain of salt. That 1st game went quickly, but neither I nor my opponent wanted to play a 2nd.

Our big gripe came when we reached a situation where the best option for one player was to make low odds suicide attacks each turn. Winning them would have totally swung the game, and losing them had zero consequence.

It simply felt wrong, as did the range of ships and artillery on a strategic map, and the fact that luck of the draw for terrain played such a huge factor. I know many like this game, but I can't recommend it at this point.

My only play so far saw me have a bad starting position. I had few tiles I could build on, the rest were sea tiles and I quickly got hemmed in. It was only the generosity of the player who eventually won, that allowed me to stay in the game for the full duration.

I believe he could have easily took my capital and other cities much earlier than he eventually did. He also had huge swaths of lucky die rolls. He certainly made the most of them with skillful play 

The comparison to Settlers, with the random terrain and the die rolls for combat rather than resources puts this in the same bracket. Luck can play a huge role, but much as in settlers skillful play can make a difference.

This is actually a fairly successful design for what it is, a sort of mash-up of Risk and the Civ computer game. There are some innovative though flawed mechanics that solve a lot of the problems of these type of games. The modular board is kind of neat, but can create large imbalances between starting areas. I wouldn't recommend the exploration set-up, because the key to strategy in this game, what little there is, is in placement of cities. You can make major mistakes if you don't know what the board layout is. The production value is impressive for a self-published game, the rules and player aids are only the really glaring mistakes.

Overall, however, I just didn't enjoy playing it all that much. I have high hopes for Viktory IV though!

Ooohhh! A game involving exploring and fighting over a new landmass!

I'm a sucker for any geographically-themed game that involves exploring/revealing a new world. Fjords, Carcasonne, Hellas, Nexus Ops, Entdecker, and Viktory II.... good stuff.

Viktory II combines this geographic exploration (with tiles and map layout very similar to Catan) with Diplomacy's economic/supply system, Conquest of the Empire's focus on combined arms, and Nexus Ops's fast and furious combat.

The system is also surprisingly flexible, allowing for multiple different victory conditions and lots of house rules. Plus it's perhaps the most gorgeous self-published game ever made. Highly recommended!

Relatively light, but still offering a suprising depth of play, Viktory II is my Go-To multiplayer wargame.  The completely modular resizeable board is genius, the battle rules rewarding combined-arms are inspired, and the strategic modeling of troop replenishment rewards aggression and punishes turtling.  Although I rate another Multiplayer wargame (Starcraft) a 10, this is a little easier for the Riskophile to grasp, and more likely to lure him in.

Mixes exploration and combat on board similar to Settlers of Catan.

So far I have read the rules, inspected the pieces, and assembled the map once to see how it goes together.  I am impressed by what I see, and hope to play it as soon as I clear the table! It looks like a winner!

A nicely done simple multiplayer wargame.  We played with 5 players and played the game until the capture of the first capital.  The game was very good, but that ending isn't particular satisfying.  I wonder if there is a better endgame condition other than complete domination.  Also, I wonder if 4 might be a bit better than 5 or 6 - slightly less downtime with roughly the same experience.

This one is all about attacking, defending is never the better option. I like a little more strategy in my conflict games.

A quick, light wargame where players can get knocked out almost immediately, where the rich get richer, and where the luck of the terrain draw strongly favors certain players over others.  Yuck.

A multiplayer wargame with a nice balancing component.  Each player essentially gets all his pieces back at the end of each of his turns.  There is also a low number of pieces per player.  The board is different in each game.  I'd like to play this more.

I enjoy this. A sort of what Risk should have been.

A very good game with some interesting stuff going on. Only complaint is a big one: Turn order decides the end game. If there was a way to randomize turn order each turn, or bid for turn order, it would be a much better game.

if this was around instead of Risk when I was growing up, I would love wargames alot more now, a simple battle game with good rules, a variable board and nice plastic pieces, it makes Risk seem generic and repetitious...

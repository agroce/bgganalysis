RATING: 7
Timeline: American History may be slightly dry for some groups, having a more "educational" feel with a heavy focus on politics, war, and national headlines, but the general nature of it means that most Americans will be familiar with the events. The Timeline series is a very light, quick game with a broadly appealing core mechanism -- organization. The art on the cards is fantastic, and though it's essentially a trivia game ("when did this event happen?"), you need only know the answer relative to other events so you've always got a chance. Mixing the sets is a common and effective approach.

RATING: 3
Very light game - only useful if people playing have a lot (or a little) historical knowledge. Playing with a mixed group does not work well at all

These are fantastic for nongamers. Very quick and easy to learn and play. I often have students come in and play them at lunch time. Hopefully some of the info will stick, too!

A fun little game to play with a large group.  Literally takes less than a minute to explain the rules.  Take this game with me wherever I know there will be a large group, especially if they are not necessarily "gamers".  Lower rating is because it really isn't a "gamers" game.  Not my favorite, but everyone else really likes it.

RATING: 7
Covers 1492-2010, but less than 10% covers events before 1770.  Deck midpoint is 1905.  The deck is well spread out between 1770 and 2010.  

Contains about 15% reprints from earlier sets.  The cards have more rounded corners than earlier sets.

RATING: 6
I like the game, but this was very poorly edited.  There are several blatant errors on the cards.

The card saying "Gerald Ford elected president" is wrong on two levels - first of all, he was never "elected* president; he wasn't even elected vice-president.  He was appointed vice president after Spiro Agnew resigned, and then ascended to the presidency after Richard Nixon resigned.  The date given on the card is the date of Richard Nixon's re-election, at which point Mr. Ford was still a representative from Michigan.

Found another error; "Theodore Roosevelt elected President".  They say 1900, but he was elected vice-president then - McKinley was president, and Roosevelt ascended upon McKinley's assassination.  He *was* elected president in 1904.

And another one, this one less explicable: "Mayflower's Historic Trip".  It was 1620, not 1615!

And yet another one... ."Klondike Gold Rush" was not in 1848 - that was the California Gold Rush.  Klondike was 1898.

"Mount Rushmore" is not specific enough - do they mean the carving started?  The carving finished?  As it turns out, we guessed the latter and were correct.

It's basically a trivia game. But you don't have to know the exact date - a rough estimate can sometimes be enough.

And since you can mix up all the different sets, replay value is still there. Or can you remember over 500 dates? :D

RATING: 3
I originally bought it for my US history classes to help them place events in history. Thought the idea of not having to know exactly when something happened was great. Tried it out with my family and they liked it somewhat. Problem, though, is that there are mistakes with some of the dates (about 10%). Some mistakes are not too bad (off 1 year or so) but some are way off. Totally replaced by Timeline Challenge which makes the game more fun and more challenging. I have added these cards to Timeline Challenge.

Another great Timeline game.  The dates are pretty tight in this one, particularly around the Civil War and the War for Independence, so it's even more important to know your history there.  Mixing this set with some others would open that up a bit.

Plays quickly, and tends to be able to engage/captivate a wide audience.   I respect it for that.   I don't love it personally, but it works better than it seems like it should.   Good game to play with seniors and elderly parents too.

Works just as well as the original. Some may like having a specific focus (think sports Trivial Pursuit vs general TP), though the smaller timeframe may make decisions a bit more difficult. Sorta wished it didn't have similar events with obvious order e.g. Pearl Harbor and Atomic bomb dropped on Japan.

RATING: 6
Timeline is a solid filler game that's quick to learn and fun to play. There are some balance issues (some cards are harder to place than others). There is also some danger in limiting replay value by memorizing the dates of events, using multiple Timeline sets helps alleviate this... and besides, learning the dates is a good thing... it's educational!

The American History edition, unlike some editions, covers dates and events that everyone in the U.S. with a high school education has at least been exposed to at some point. It should make the game easier - but the because the dates happen in a much smaller span of years (no 10,000 B.C. in this set), it can be really tricky when the gaps between events really shrink unless one knows the exact date.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (July 2015)

I really like the Timeline series of games, however I’m finally getting somewhat tired of them. This edition mixes well with Timeline: Americana and Timeline: Music & Cinema, with the other sets it is (often) obvious where in the timeline you should put your card. The reason is that the dates from this set are, more or less, modern.

Bottom line, Timeline: American History is a fun game to play from time to time, it is very quick and you do learn something new :D, however, many events are lost on us (we aren`t from North America).

Put the cards depicting events in American history into the right spots on the developing time line based on when they occurred: if it's right, it stays and grows the line; if it's wrong, you get another card. Winner is the one who clears theirs all out. That's all the instruction you need -- but if you're not an American, it's only recent things (like Presidential elections after 1948) that you'll know easily. It's fun, educational, quick and easy to learn. The downside is that, when you've got all the dates down, you need to mix in other sets to bring the challenge back.

BIG PLUS: inexpensive, fun & educational - with strong involvement by all players!
BIG MINUS: size of the cards, not to easy if you're not American

I'm not sure how great a "game" it is, but it can be a wonderful experience. The entire table talks about the events and what they remember about them, as well as how they decided to place the event where they did. A fun time on the table for sure... with the right group.

The Timeline games are all basically the same thing. Pick a topic that grabs you (and at least one other) and start playing. You'll know immediately if it's the kind of thing you'll dig. I bought this for my wife, who was a history major in another life. I was hoping that she would either a.) request it, or b.) see some love of reading get reignited. 

Still waiting.

Got these timeline games at like 5 bucks each on clearance, and they have been a good alternative to the regular circuit for the family/holiday circuit, plus can be done quickly so you dont become too bored with your family, just a few quick rounds and move on.

Definitely need all the tins if you want an extended play session.

Any version of Timeline makes for excellent filler, with the exception that replayability is low for the owner of the game.  It's a bit like Trivial Pursuit in that there's little working your way into a good play if you're unfamiliar with a given subject.  That's the case with Timeline: American History, which plays to my weaknesses.

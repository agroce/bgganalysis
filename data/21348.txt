Finally a true "gamer's game" in the T2R series. The game has a marvelous gaming tension to it that is a hallmark of great games. Completing tickets are tricky because the predominant north-south lines have a lot of competition. And completing the most tickets is a very important (not to be overlooked) 10 point bonus. But that's one layer of the cake. A second layer is the passenger system which forces players into a game of chicken over "when" to make those points. Do you try to take the larger points quickly before your lines are more fully developed? Or do you wait until mid to late game when you can run a passenger over many, many cities but with lower payouts per city? The game offers many roads to victory. And the frosting (to complete the cake analogy) is the beautiful card artwork, pieces, and game board. Train hobbyists will love to look at the cards nearly as much as gamers will enjoy playing the game. Best game I've played in a looooong time. (Update 8-2-06: Moved rating up .5 after yet another terrific game.)

I prefer this to original TTR, as the extra facet of passengers gives another strategy to pursue. I don't find it fiddly to set up (as some have complained) - only slightly longer due to placing the passenger tokens. As it is usually 2 or 3 playing, mostly we choose TTR:Nordic instead, as it's our favourite TTR.

Well, I didn't want a more complicated TtR. I was fine with the original. So this is like a sequel to a really great movie. It can't live up to the hype of its predecessor.  It stings as well with a longer set up time and diverging strategy. But I suppose if you're looking for a more complicated TtR, this is the one to get.

The best TtR there is. The gameplay is a bit more complicated which makes Märklin Edition a bit harder to approach for all non-gamers but at the same time we gamers get rewarded.


2013/01
8->7
Since I've refused to play TtR a couple of times proves that an 8 was too high a rating. 

2014/10
Original = Best for families with 4-5 players, elegant rules, suffers from card hoarding strategy

Märklin = Most satisfactory for gamers, strong incentive to make early plays mitigating the hoarding problem, a bit fiddly

Nordic = Best for families with 2-3 players, slight hoarding problems which are mitigated by the tight map, random take that aspects due to the tunnel mechanics

Europe = worst of the bunch in all aspects

UPDATE August 2015:
Sold the game after was left unplayed for at least 2-3 years. Deemed it as unnecessary fire load. But still, it is clearly a SEVEN for me.

RATING: 8
Great addition to the TtR family.  This one's a lot more of a gamer's game than the others and has considerably more strategy.

A few thoughts so far:

1. You don't necessarily win by playing big routes...it can be very important to bag good merchandise tokens with your passengers. This is a big change from the strategy that wins USA and, to a lesser degree, Europe. 
2. Short routes may be better than long ones as they are more likely to get you the 10 card for the most routes. A mixture of both is best. 
3. If you go out first you don't automatically come first or second. Far from it - I won easily with by far the most trains left (13). 
4. The glut of short, grey routes in the SW makes for an interesting dynamic, and it's often necessary (as in USA) to fill some of these quickly esp in a 2/3 player game. 
5. Drawing extra destination cards is a much better idea here than in the other games - a. because you can pick short or long ones only if you know you need that type b. because of the 10 points for the most completed. However, there's so much going on on the board that it's hard (as in the other games) to find a turn to do this.

I like it a step above the typical TtR ruleset. The three runs of passengers (for potentially big points) adds a certain level of strategy to the game. The division of tickets into "short" and "long" routes and the addition of the +4 locomotives haven't yet proven their value to me, though. Perhaps through further plays.

UPDATE: Shines at 2p.

My wife loves this game, but we don't play by the Marklin rules - we usually play by the Europe rules with tunnels indicated by black marker outlines on random routes and the passenger pieces used to indicate train stations.  It works very well, and is pretty well balanced when played in this way.

This is, IMO, the strongest of the three games.  Because of the passengers, it requires that much more discussion making per turn.  This makes it more of a gamers game.  

Both my daughter will ask to play this game frequently.

With two kids (9 and 7), I find it takes about an hour to play.  But it keeps them engaged throughout.  

It does take a few plays to understand the passengers for the kids, but they get it.

RATING: 2
TTR isn't bad.  See?  I don't hate all Euros.  Granted, it isn't GREAT, but it isn't bad.  Take it for what it is: a simple themeless optimization puzzle.

But no, now we add "cubes" and call them passengers, and we add fiddly rules for those passengers.  Hey, I thought TTR was about BEING a passenger.  If I want a crappy Eurogame about building rail lines and moving cubes, I'll go play Railways of the World.  On second thought, I think I'll just pass up both and go place myself in an iron maiden: it would be more fun.

Now if you were doing something BETTER, such as delivering nuclear weapons to cities in order to destroy them or maybe picking up some dinosaurs to move around so that they could destroy your opponents, then yeah, this expansion would be totally worth it, but as it stands, no.  It's bad: very, very bad.

Bastante más interesante que Ticket to Ride básico gracias a la mecánica de los pasajeros que enriquece bastante las estrategias a desarrollar por los jugadores, apremiándoles a construir las vias lo más pronto posible para recolectar puntos.

Interesting differences vs. [GAMEID=9209] (the original).  There appear to be a lot more connections.  The passengers add an interesting scoring mechanic that cannot be ignored.  The short & long route distinction is nice.  The 4+ wilds are also very nice.  I like the variety in the card pictures.

Probably not a good place to start with the [URL=http://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/Ticket_to_Ride_series]Ticket to Ride Series[/URL], but an excellent follow up.  I'd love to play this one again.  I think it offers additional depth and potential beyond the base game, and in a good manner, too.  May have to pick this one up someday.

It is basically the same game as Ticket to Ride, but the map features Germany. It's design is top knotch, as the cards feature different types of locomotives and railcars owned by DB, OBB and SBB throughout their history. It has a few changes, such as connecting to adjacent countries instead of cities and the transportation of passangers.

a game of claiming train routes that is about a billion times more fun than that sounds. You gain points not only for claiming connections between cities, but also for both forming full routes between distant locations and for sending passengers along, picking up bonuses at every station. It really is good fun and almost pitifully easy to learn.

For trade: I'd rather have TTR: Europe

This version of the TtR series is the most balanced and enjoyable from a gamers perspective. Still a fun game like the original but with some meat you can sink your teeth into. The new elements add some very nice touches to the game. If I had to say anything bad about the game it'd have to be that the set-up is a bit of a pain and it does tend to last longer than it seems it should but these are really minor complaints.

It's a deeper game than the original TTR, with the added passengers and goods markers forcing you to get your routes down before the other players steal all of the good stuff.  I own the original, and although I wouldn't buy TTR Europe, TTR Marklin is a different enough game to consider adding to the collection.  My 2006 BGG Secret Santa got this for me, and I couldn't be happier.

Passengers idea is great, makes game more complex than Europe/USA version. Quite boring on two - one person goes east, second one goes west - no interaction. But with 3+ is much better. For two players I would reccomend Europe version (haven't played Nordic Countries).

Fixes the problem I had with the tickets in earlier TtR's.  The passengers introduce a gamerly element, but they're a tad fiddly and I think I prefer the simplicity of the original.  

The Marklin artwork is quite nice, though differentiation between the locos and the black carriages could have been better.  All the same, it's still just TtR and I really can't get very excited about this family of games.

I didn't have the feeling that the passenger adds much to the basic filosophy of the game, apart from being different than the original Ticket to Ride and Ticket to Ride Europe. Personally I wish the map would have been pre-war Germany with those big impressive beautiful steamlocomotives.

Just as the other Ticket to Rides it's fun to play, but annoying when others break your route. I also find that there is a too heavy concentration on the western part of the map.

Rating after a simgle  play.  Play is closer to standard TtR than to TtR:E which is a good thing IMO.  I like the separated long and short routs that are continuously availible.  The passenger movements are interesting and the elimination of the longest route in favor of the most completed tickets bonus is interesting.  All in all, enjoyable.  The card art is beautiful....

I think there are plus (passengers, long & short routes) and minus (fiddly, I don't like the map) points for this edition so it's getting the same rating as the other two. Maybe that's a little unfair because if I was pressed to choose one it would probably be Marklin. The main problem I have is that an hour (or two) of angst is not my idea of a great gaming experience.

RATING: 9
Another great title from the Ticket to Ride line.  Like the original, Marklin comes with a great set of components and a very functional insert for which to store them in.  Gameplaywise Marklin adds a few twists, such as fixing up ticket distribution and longer routes to claim, and one new turn action (Passenger movement).  Overall, Marklin distills the same amount of tension and thought that the original did in a new package.  I'd still always introduce new gamers to the U.S. map, but for anyone who has even played TTR at least once, Marklin is very easy to get into and gives players a good deal amount more to mull over each turn.

{2 plays, 4-5 players} I think this says more about me and my gaming tastes these days, but this is yet another game in which the original didn't need much improving upon (though I like the newer ticket division system).  The passengers are okay, but they didn't *add* anything for me.  It wasn't better, just different.  But "different" is clearly what a lot of people want (see: Carcassone), and the basic TtR system is still here, which is good.  Having played all 3 now, it wouldn't surprise me if I never (or rarely) play this or Europe over the original again.

A shade better than earlier versions, but still has same old problems -- not much interaction or fun, and highly derivative of other games. No one tries blocking anyone else; it just seems to be a case of "collect cards and play them."  No one really focuses on anything except their own goals.  If any blocking occurs it is unwittingly. Four people playing solitaire isn't a game.

Unlike the second edition of Ticket to Ride (T2R: Europe), this edition brings in some truly new game play options in the form of passengers.  Combined with a vastly different scale map (Germany vs US vs EU), the game ends with a definitely unique feel.  Overall, it adds a bt more strategic feeling and has a slightly more gamer feel to it.  The cards are beautiful pictures of Marklin products and are much more interesting to look at then previous editions.  For experienced T2R and model train fans, this is a nice edition to add to any collection.  For the ultimate T2R experience, combine passengers, train stations, and tunnels in any previous edition and see the game that could have been. [GTI: TGCL]

The passengers and merchandise tokens you collect when moving them around are the real difference between this and the other Ticket to Ride sets, and a worthy one.

The lack of stations can make this a brutal game, and the passengers is an interesting mechanic to add a difference and make it more gamey.  Fun for something different, but I think that Europe is still my favorite version.  Still much more of a gamer's game than the others  in this series.  Deeper, but not necessarily more fun.  Plays well with 5, but 4 probably gives you more control.

Eddig ez a TTR tetszik legjobban, mert itt nem működik az a faék stratégia, ami a többinél. Egyértelműnek tűnik, hogy tudatosan javították a korábbiaknak a hibáit, ezzel némileg igazolva érzem az általunk nyerőnek gondolt stratégiát pl. az Europa-nál.

A javítások: a legtöbb teljesített célra jár a jutalompont. Kevés szürke szakasz van, azok is rövidek. És szerintem az utazás is bekavar, mivel elég sok pont szerezhető belőle. Bár ettől függetlenül most is a leghosszabb szakaszokat építő nyert.

Amit nem javítottak ki: szinte sosem azonos akciószáma van a játékosoknak, nem megy végig a kör. Ez béna szerintem.

i'm think, there was no need to change the original rules. different maps are ok. the size of card is unnecesseraly big, the color of red and orange is still problematic. i find selling the new versions as standalone a bad idea. i would probably by a new map as an extension, but i will never by three times the whole game.

Got this in June of 2010 for my birthday.  Still haven't played it more than 5 times.  Nevertheless, I have played it enough to be able to teach others the quick differences between it and its cousins.  Also I have played it enough to realize this game has a very specific niche--it's for those who like TTR but want a more complex game to play.  This is it.

Personally, when I'm in the mood for TTR, this is not what I have in mind.  Stacking the cargo tokens (and keeping them stacked) is a P.I.T.A. as is having your whole system of tickets completed upset in the score by somebody who makes good use of the passengers (or of the left side of the board.)  For me there just isn't a clear way to master the game and having to work this hard at TTR isn't enticing...yet.

I think this is the best Ticket to Ride for those who prefer heavier games. It avoid's TTR:Europe's randomness, and really has tension of the "When to pull the trigger?" (for passengers). However, it has a lot more setup/teardown time, and recently I've been more partial to USA/1910.

Being the 3rd in the series with only minor changes, I just can't seem to get too excited over it. While the addition of the passengers adds another option for veteran players of the series, it may be a bit too much for new players.

RATING: 6
I think I prefer the basic Ticket to Ride version better.  For such a simple game, the additional rules that makes this version of Ticket to Ride "deeper" just cumbersome.  It loses its streamlined and accessible feel.  The setup time with the passenger chits makes the game "daunting" to play sometimes and misses out on table time because of it.  I think I'd rather keep the Ticket to Ride franchise in the filler category.

Update: Sep 30, 2007
I have to downgrade the ranking for this game down.  I think it is a fine game, but it is just awkward as far as which niche it is suppose to fill.  It is too fiddly and too many rules as a good gateway game and it is too light to be played with experienced gamers and I would rather play other games if I am with that kind of company.  I am now looking for Ticket to Ride original with 1910 expansion.

Probably it's down to the fact that I'm used to TtR:E but I didn't like passangers concept. For me it just doesn't fit and unnecessarily complicates the game. On the other hand, unique card graphics look awesome, I wish TtR:E had unique graphics too.

The board design is rather ugly with all the gray routes.  Other than that, the passengers add some variety to the Ticket to Ride system.  Although  Marklin is as well designed as the original, it's the sort of game that isn't played very often.  If playing with non-gamers, I would always prefer the original USA map over Marklin.  Gamers would rather play something else, so it stays on the shelf.

IMHO, Marklin is the crown jewel of Moon's TtR series. Marklin has all the depth and nuanced strategy that is lacking in USA and Europe.  If you're not a fan of USA or Europe because the game experience seems thin, then get Marklin.  

Since I've only played once, I'm going to reserve officially rating the game.  Unofficially, it is a solid 8 with a strong upside due to the way destination tickets are drawn, the extra layer of strategy with passengers, and the cut-throat nature of the map. (EDIT 3.24.12 - Added brief review.)

I like this map much more than the original map. The passengers add some extra things that you need to keep in mind (in a good way). The setup is a little goofy with all of the little point pieces that you have to put on the cities, but it's not so bad.

Edit - bumped my rating up a bit. This is not a game we play very often. But I really do like it. It's good for when you're in the mood for Ticket to Ride, but just a little bit heavier. Nordic is good this way too, but sometimes, we're just not in the mood for all the blocking (too stressful!)

Ticket to Ride is not my thing, regardless of the edition. I understand that it works as gateway game and I could even suggest it to a person who doesn't know eurogames, but I would only play if pressured into it. It is just set collecting and blokcing each others on the map, somehow that isn't strategically appealing to me. And I don't understand the enthusiasim towards trains and railroads that the board gaming hobby has. I can see connecting railroads coudl be a fun theme, but why are there hundreds of games about it? Of course I also understand that there are people who build model trains, but I doubt all the baord gamers are that much into trains.

This game is so simple to play, and yet keeps the tension high the whole time.  I would even say the tension is higher in this version than the previous 2 versions.  I really like the options between the short and the long tickets, and I like the extra strategy element of the passengers.  I think this is a fantastic version of TTR.  Maybe even better than the original?  Or maybe because its new.

Plays great with or without the passenger mechanic, in fact I've played it more often without than with it.

[Got it new and very cheap with damaged box on eBay.]
Best of the first three by far. A more balanced board really allows you to focus strictly on a long-route or on a short-route (with passenger points) strategy. The passengers add another level to think about, and the points from the passengers make up for building lots of short routes, which really gives you more choices strategy-wise.

Being a mild train enthusiast, I really like the card artwork on this one.  The map is also done quite nicely.

It sure feels different from other TTR games. Better than US, not as good as Europe, I feel. The passangers (although a nice mechanic by itself) dilute the tension from connecting cities and completing routes. Plus, it adds a somewhat annoying 5 minute setup for the game.

I also prefer longest continuous route over "having completed more tickets" (although I understand it's a better choice of endgame bonus for this game). Still a very good game, though, and I like the extra meatiness.

I love the separate ticket piles (short v. long) and the switch from "longest route" to "most tickets" for the 10pt bonus.  ** update: luck-of-draw from ticket deck (and train deck) seems to predominate.  Still a fun game, though **

To me, Ticket to Ride: Europe is a lot better. Märklin was fun a couple of times to get some variation but if you want a simple but fun game that fits a broad audience; buy Ticket to Ride: Europe instead... if you happen to love TtR:Europe, this could be interesting to simply add some variation.

I've played the basic TtR enough to know that it wasn't a game I needed in my collection.  TtR-Europe didn't really grab me, so I'm surprised by how much I like Märklin.  This version hit the sweet spot for me between complexity and ability to draw in new players.  Glad I have it in my collection, and the unique train models depicted upon every card are wonderfully done.  

I found much to like with the addition of Passengers/Merchandise tokens over base TtR; those rules add just enough tension to make for a managable extra layer/dimension.  The Deutschland map is much more appealing to me than the standard one of the US as well.

I've always had issues with the swinginess of tickets in Ticket to Ride.  The Marklin Edition ramps this up to new levels.  The routes chosen for the tickets makes a select few locations abnormally lucrative for the Long Tickets, and by separating them into Long and Short players can hit all too often.

My plays of this game have devolved into "who can keep pulling huge routes out of the deck turn after turn" instead of the tenser, board control elegance of other editions.  Took the focus away from what makes the game fun.

Builds on the Ticket to Ride series by focusing on Germany and introducing a new element where merchandise worth points are picked up along routes.

More than the first two TTR games this game has a lot of things you'd really like to do but the clock is working much more severely against you.  There are so many tempting things to try to do in the game especially with the addition of the passengers and being able to take four of your choice of long and short route tickets.  But if you try all of them, you will lose and you need to focus.  With all these ways to get points the game reminds me a lot of Hacienda.  But I'm wondering if getting lots of short Western tickets and cleaning up with the passengers would be an unbeatable strategy?  My two plays seem to suggest that this is a definite possibility.  Still, as fun as the first two although I think I still like TTR: Europe the best.

Had played Ticket to Ride but jumped at the chance of TTR with a little more meat on it's bones.  The passengers plus the short versus long card choices scratched that itch.  Plus, I lived in Germany so like the idea of a German map.

RATING: 7
It's heavy, it's packed with different options and the cards are all different, making it beautiful and not exactly friendly. When I have serious Ticket to Ride fans around, I'll bring Marklin out, but other than that, Marklin stays on the shelf for just being too imposing.

just got his and gave it a spin once. a few hiccups with the rules, nothing too big. Bought it when my first choice Thurn and Taxis was unavailable, great looking, good play, lots of chance taking with route selection, passengers are interesting. The group wasn't overly plussed with it after first run, but are willing to give it another go.
update: introduced this one to another group, and they really got into it. Much more enjoyable. there is a definite strategy

RATING: 9.5
My favorite version of TTR. The passengers lend an agonizing complexity to an already stressful game: some of the most lucrative passenger routes are also on the worst routes for points, with only one- or two-trains per leg. Around Berlin all the routes are long, and the 7-point passenger token is tempting, but it's hotly contested and not a lot else surrounds it. Timing the passenger routes can also be tricky: early bonuses necessitate shorter routes, whereas waiting for a massive haul  over several cities runs the risk of having passengers stolen from you. Very tense. Very fun.

RATING: 8
I liked the new purple color and the concept of running your passengers around.  The art is beautiful on the cards, and I liked the layout of the new board as well.  You have to balance your routes with timing to get your passengers the most points.  Unfortunately, I think a lot of people are going to view the blowouts in this game as adding more luck to the TtR franchise, but I saw it as a welcome change of pace and a real opportunity for strategy.

The gameplay is good and tense. Stressing as to when to send your passenger around the board is great. The actual piling of the chits and dealing with picking them up etc... is a bit fiddly. Too bad there isn't a better method for handling this. I lost one of the chits when I initially opened the board, so it's a bit annoying having to deal with that each time as well.

The one thing that sets this game apart from the previous two to me is that the rules for taking tickets have been streamlined and improved, which may not sound like much but really makes a BIG difference. I have really mixed feelings on the passengers. On the one hand, it's nice to have a way to make up for routes you were blocked out of, but that makes things less cutthroat and a lot more fiddly. I think passengers work a lot better than stations, though.

Another good entry in the Ticket to Ride series.  This time, the longest rail doesn't give a bonus, but the most routes completed does.  Although this tries to make short runs more attractive, it seems like long runs still work best as a winning strategy.

Right now, I am giving this a good rating, and I think it will stay there.  This is the way to play Ticket to Ride for gamers.  When I introduce others, I will show them the original at first.  Eventually, I would hope that those new players will get to this one with the added complexity and realize how great it is.  This is the best designed of the series hands down.  I always thought the idea of TTR was a good one. I never blasted the original for being decided on opening tickets or being this super luckfest.  I just didn't think it offered the gamer enough to keep them interested.  This one does.

This edition is more of a gamers Ticket to Ride. There are a few more rules and stuff you need to think and plan about, though it's obviously not a heavy game.

This is a really weird game for me.  Every time I read something about it, it is usually of the nature of "This game sucks".  I guess I consider other's opinions too much.  But then I go and play it, and it turns into a game that is a lot of fun for me.  Despite what others may think, I still rate this one high on my list.  It truly encompasses the "fun" factor of a game that I like to see.

A few additional comments to add after making my first comment.  This game has a very interesting "Screw your Opponent" mechanic in the game when playing with 4 or 5 players.  The map can get really crowded really quick, and with 4 or 5 players, lots of blocking can happen.  I have seen one 5 player game where one of the players did not get a single ticket completed because everyone else kept taking his "single-line" routes.  It was not fun for him, and I wonder if he will ever play the game again.

This appears to be the first non-traditional AT game I have played that can lend itself to have a really nasty "screw you" consequence not found in most non-AT games.

Overall, though, this game still continues to remain at an 8.

EDIT - now 7.5, as there are other games that go to the top of the list.  And I bought the 10th Anniversary Edition of the US map, and thus gave this one away to my brother-in-law since I like the US map and US mechanics better.  So there you have it.  My second-favorite TTR game.

The best of the TtR series, in my book. The ability to choose freely between long and short distance tickets means you can develop a strategy, but the real plus are the passengers. To win you'll have to prevent your opponents from grabbing a lucrative route. In addition, the easy short routes in the Ruhr and Rhine become desirable property. To top it off, it's possible that you might build a route that an opponent can use for his passenger. In short, much more to think about than just picking up sets of cards.

RATING: 6
On first play, I thought it was better than the light but mediocre original, but on second play I concluded it had even more problems.  Because it's easier in this edition for routes to be completely blocked, it's pot luck whose route draws late in the game help or hurt.  Our game was decided when two players drew on consecutive turns -- one drew only routes he couldn't use, the other drew routes he'd already connected, and that was the game right there.  Really sucks the meaning out of the previous hour of play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This might be my current favorite from the TTR series. Makes much more sense that you would recieve bonus points for the most completed routes and not just the longest train on the board. (If I'm a passenger on a train, it doesn't matter how far the train travels, if it doesn't go to my desired destination.) I like the additional element of passengers and cargo.

When I was a kid, I loved my Märklin model trains. So of course I had to try this edition of Ticket to Ride. How is it compared to the original Ticket to Ride game? I like the separation of the destination cards into two decks (one for long distance connections and one for short distances) giving players the choice of which deck(s) to draw from. Also there are new destination cards for neighbouring country connections which strangely enough are not mentioned by the rules at all. Apart from that, the rules are fine but I would have loved to see a "what is different if you know the original rules" sheet included. Sadly, the newly added passenger and goods system just seems expendable and isn't worth the fiddly setup at all. Also the passenger cards combined with locomotive cards and the new long distance locomotive cards tend to clog up the card display so that we usually end up drawing from the face down card deck only. About the Märklin graphics on the train cards I am still indecisive: On the one hand I like them and many of them remind me of my own Märklin trains. But on the other hand it regularly irritates me that no two cards look the same - I have to force myself to pay attention to the card's corner symbols instead of their main images. In the end this edition gets the same rating that I gave the original game. (This is for the German Days of Wonder (2006) edition.)

My first play was in the Gathering tournament. Everyone else at the table had played multiple times before, and were able and willing to play *much* faster than I was. I was struggling just to find my cities on the map and try to sketch out a possible route. Despite hearing the rule that the bonus 10 points goes not to the player with the longest train, but rather to the player who completes the most routes, I realized halfway through the game that I was still playing as if I were going for the longest train. Oops. The passenger thing, as mentioned before, really does apply a bit of pressure to get routes earlier, which is nice. You can still play as before, but you can easily score in the 30 point range just from spending a couple turns on shuttling off passengers instead of taking cards or building routes. It feels different enough that I look forward to playing this more. Oddly, this uses the exact same mechanic as Thurn & Taxis for having numerous stacks of VP tokens which are sequenced so that the first player to get one scores n, then next n minus 1, etc. Hmmm... Anyway, I like TTR:M better in this regard, because a player can claim more than one token in a given stack.

My girlfriend deserved a treat, and I know she had been looking for this title for a long time now. That she search out the Märklin-edition of Ticket To Ride instead of the base game, or any other version, was because of some searching and asking for advice: I'm not partial to the base game which is far too luck-ridden to be interesting. So with this in mind I ordered the Märklin-box one evening, and presented it to her amidst some snuggling and smooching.

The game itself is, to be brutally honest, a marginal step above the base game. Which is to say that it's not interesting at all save for friendly family gaming sessions. This game is really not more complex at all. It appears to offer you greater control over your goal cards, which is of course a good thing for then you can plan much more, right? You'd certainly expect so, but not in combination with a brutally random card draw (yes, random), and thus devoid of genuine tension. You simply keep drawing cards until you can claim a route, and that will happen sooner or later. It is simply not a process you can influence in any meaningful way. The only thing which is a little nice are the passengers who tour around the country; timing when to grab the point chits is a little above trivial as there is some healthy competition for them. But it depends too much on what your opponents have in their hands to be successful, so I doubt there's more to it than just creating a good route and claiming it when you need to draw too many cards to risk leaving the passenger(s) waiting.

I gave the game as a gift, but had I purchased it myself, it would go onto the trade pile straight away. I will also play it from time to time (my mother seemed to enjoy it a good deal), but other than that it served as another nail in Alan Moon's coffin: apart from the brilliant San Marco (which, adding insult to injury, he developed jointly with another author), and the cute but somewhat rough Andromeda, none of his designs strikes a particular chord with me. Ticket To Ride: Märklin is, regrettably, no exception.

This is a very solid and approachable game, provided you ignore the passenger rules and just play it like standard TTR. The passenger rules make the game fiddly and undesirably complex, and I'm not sure they significantly change the outcome anyway (i.e. someone who wins via passengers was likely to win regardless).

Played as normal TTR this is an 8. If you use the passenger rules I'd drop this to a 6.

Another great expansion for the Ticket to Ride franchise.  This game adds another dimension to the routes for scoring additional points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The original game sucked, too many northern eastern short routes then those long western routes, you really could not let anyone player dominate unchecked in those east coast short routes,  having to buy the expansion to help improve as balance the game instead of really expanding it just isn't something I want to invest in. 

The original game is just too cut throat, blocking occurs too much. That and they sell the original without that expansion included is appalling as the game is broken without it.

I find the original game boring, as n terms of game play.

In Märklin the map routes just seem better balanced, the passenger subgame element  helps to smooth out the game.

Having to use turns for the passengers, collecting passenger cards,  is something you can't ignore and playing the passenger is done at the expense of route building. 

Yes there are a few high points tokens to be collected by the first players to run a passenger down some routes, but worst is having the low tokens like 2 points picked up leaving nothing for other that followers.

These low points can easily add up to a big route ticket. The passenger play helps stop or cuts down turns use for intentionally blocking as you must use those turns instead for the passenger play.

Ticket to Ride Europe is the other version that is less cut throat via of the stations. The routes in that game seem to offer less easy work arounds then in Märklin, so the 3 stations given to each player to allow use of another player’s section of track gives this game a more family feeling. You play stations at the expensive of cards, turns, and the points the stations are worth at the end of the game if unused. The ferry mechanic seems to fit the map well as does the tunnels. 

Yes, many people dislike the slight sub game of playing X number of Y color cards for a tunnel, not knowing how long the tunnel will turn out to be. For that, you draw 3 more cards. If any of those cards are of color Y that you played you must play another card of each of that color in. The only problem here is one may just plan ahead and have the, at most 3, extra cards you may need or risk losing a turn if you don’t have them.

Stations, ferries, tunnels and more interest then the original boring game of set collection and blocking. I think the dislike for the Europe version is because it just isn’t as hardcore cut throat that the original one is played at. 

The non-stand alone versions for few players like 3 players max, suffer from this cutthroat feeling as they are just very scaled down routes with basically the original rules.

This edition of TtR tries to pack too much into one package.  It's trying to be both TtR and Thurn and Taxis at the same time, which is unnecessary.

The passengers and the freedom of choice between long and short tickets makes the game more strategic. The passengers also balance up the map a lot between going for the shorter tracks of western Germany or the longer tracks in the east part of Germany.

Great game, much better than TtRE and even better than original USA version. Game full of tension every turn, because tracks can be easily blocked (especially those short grey routes which are important for short tickets) Passangers are very good idea, although it takes more time to prepare the game. Great

Production:  Same great Days of Wonder production.  The full-size cards are good, and I especially like having a unique train on every card.  Play: The passengers add an interesting element, giving cities variable worth as their passenger tokens are depleted, and also ratcheting up the tension, as players greedily delay the activation of their passenger, hoping for the big score.  I also like the separation of the tickets into two piles based on length, allowing players more control over their luck.  I think the only new feature that I find unnecessary is the 4+ Locomotive. (3+2+4) (1 play)

This is the only version of Ticket to Ride that I own.  Alan R. Moon's game Elfenland was the first Euro-style game I purchased new from the store about a decade ago.  Ticket to Ride became much more popular than Elfenland.
All Days of Wonder games offer exceptional production value, certainly including this one.
I believe I ordered this directly from Days of Wonder.  They were offering a free game (possibly this one) with any order valued at about $50.  But with shipping and taxes, both games cost me the same as if I had bought them at the local store.  So I'm not a fan of ordering games directly from Days of Wonder.  The box lid of this game has some shipping damage as well.
I should play this game more than I do.  It really is a good game.  It is a map of Germany.  Each of the coloured train cards presents an actual Marklin train car, so there are 118 different cards to look through, if you are into model railroading.  (I'm not.)

Märklin is a heavier version in the TTR series, allowing players to not only travel from city to city but also from cities to countries. A new mechanic is also introduced in the form of passengers and merchandise tokens. When the game is set-up a series of merchandise values worth victory points are placed on nominated cities. The values of these tokens diminish when multiple tokens are present within a single city, requiring players to move quickly to capture the higher valued tokens.

I've only played this once, so far, but really enjoyed it. I feel they have cleaned up some of the rules for better game play, such as: 1)There are distinguished short and long routes. 2)I like the twist that passengers add to the game. 3)Even though a lot of the tracks are longer than other versions they added a locomotive that is for tracks 4 or longer in addition to the regular locomotive. The cards are interesting, though. The artwork on them is way nicer than previous versions, but everyone who played this was confused that all cards of the same color don't have the same image on the card, so that distracted from the actual game play.

Pro:
- Good theme;
- Easy to learn;
- Game if usually very fast;
- Passengers add additional strategies to the game and you can always play without them, if you want.

Cons:
- Replayability seems to be rather low;
- sometimes your actions are limited by a very "bad" selection of cards and you cannot do much to influence it.

Result:
Solid transport game for any company.

Would have to play a few more times to really find where this game sits.

In my first game there was a mad dash for passenger tokens mid way through the game, then a mad dash for tickets at the end. The winning player had completed 10 out of 11 tickets and still had a number of trains to spare. That didn't feel right to me that it should have been that easy.

I did enjoy the added passenger element, it gave you more to think about during the game as well as some tension!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This is less of a gateway game for new players, but has more depth for seasoned gamers. I think it is a great addition to the series. In addition to the basic gameplay of Ticket to Ride, this version offers a new mechanic in which players can transport up to three passengers on their routes, and sometimes over the routes of the their opponents. Points are scored for each city that the passenger travels between, except the first. This adds to the depth of the game as well as the length. It is a licensed product for Marklin hobby trains and the artwork reflects this quite nicely. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this less than TtR:Europe or TtR:Original. 
The passengers certainly add a thoughtful extra layer of gaming. Angling to collect lots of big tokens before another player sweeps through collecting them is a classic escalation game... who'll give in and collect instead of building for a bigger haul.

But I'm less impressed with the rest of the changes. The map is VERY tight and tickets can quickly become impossible. This version may have deserved the stations from TtR:E. The new +4 locos are also a no-brainer to collect for those players lucky enough to have one come up in thier turn and are less about gaming skill than pure luck.

My favorite "new" game at the Gathering this year.  I have not yet tested it with non-gamers but I have a feeling that it will go over as well as the original - at least that is my hope!  I have tired of the original Ticket to Ride, partly because I think the tickets are unbalanced.  I am excited about the possibility of this version being better balanced.

---UPDATE---
This game does not go over as well with non-gamers.  The extra rules and fiddlyness is enough to push it over the edge for them.  

There are also times when you feel like you chose your path 5 turns ago, others chose a similar path due to no fault of your own, there is nothing you can do differently now but you have to continue playing out the strategy because you can't change part way into the game, and you know you have no chance of winning.  So my enjoyment of this game has gone down over time, while my enjoyment of the original T2R has continued (and maybe even increased).

Forget the others in the series.  It's really like they were just practice for developing this one.  The passengers create a balance between trying to hurry and trying to stockpile.

Latest in the Ticket to Ride series, set in Germany.  The basic Ticket to Ride game system is very easy to learn - collect coloured cards, turn coloured cards into coloured track segments on the game board, connect cities on your secret tickets to score hidden points at the end of the game.  The new stuff in this game are +4 wild cards (for 4+ segment lengths), and passengers - these are placed after a segment build and take a turn to suck fiddly victory points markers off the board for each visited city.  The game is 85% Ticket to Ride, with this new stuff tossed in.  No tunnels, no stations, feels a bit tighter and more unforgiving.  The art on the cards is a bit "busy".

The gamer's TtR. Another great edition to the series. More strategies to employ, & interesting timing elements with the passengers. It's a bit more fiddly, and takes longer. Doesn't quite hit the sweet spot like Europe or Switzerland do for me, but the map is great and gets fairly competitive.

They've tightened up the game considerably.  Over four games, and every single game (4player, 5player, 3player 4players) someone has been "screwed" out of the optimal path.  The token's definately add strategy to the game, and the new +4 wilds are a no-brainer take these days.  No negative comments from the group either.

RATING: 6.7
(Up from 6.5 base game)
Marklin isn't a bad TtR map.  It has some nifty new ideas, like the +4 wilds that can be claimed from the display like a normal card.  Also, the separation between long and short route decks, so you can select your own risk/reward level each time.
The map's a bit lopsided, with many long routes in the east and short ones in the west.  Supposedly, the passengers help balance this, but I don't know..  The idea seems to be that a bunch of small links are easier to do, and thus you can hit more cities with your passenger.  But the most  valuable city is in the east, and many of the cities have only a single 2-point chip on them.  So, if you aren't the first one to get there, you could be getting a low number of points, regardless of how many cities you hit.  I don't think the passenger cards are that great, either.  You rarely see anyone try to take them, and there are 10 in the deck (at least 2 too many).  They just tend to clog up the display.  And all you get out of playing them, on one of the at most 3 occasions you can, is another bonus chip.  If there's another player's track connected to the city where your line ends, and if the city at the other end of that link has a chip still on it.
Anyway, it's a neat idea, and the art on the cards is great, so the map is OK overall.  I wish you could use the cards on the other maps, though, but this is the only one to have an odd color construction.

Very well executed twist on the original.  My only problem is, it almost always makes sense to build lots of shorter routes, because you can rack up more passenger points at all the stops, and you can more easily earn the 10 point bonus for completing the most routes.  This makes building longer routes seem like a far less viable strategy - at least in the games I've played so far.

There is nothing wrong with passangers, they work, and they make TtR:Marklin a medium weight game. However passangers feel a little 'tacked on'.

This version of the TTR series gives me fits of rage everytime and all those little passenger tokens ..A very aggravating game in my opinion and not worth the extra effort; just stick with TtR: Europe, that's a perfect game

(2-5 players) Best one in the series! Lots of options for scoring so very strategic. Seems like there might be too many passenger cards but maybe we're just passing up some scoring for the sake of completing tickets. The passengers add a lot of tension as everyone waits to maximize passenger runs. Lots of disappointment when people decide to make their passenger runs and deplete the supply of merchandise.

This game is not ticket to ride.

The passengers seem to be very over-costed in terms of victory points so you rush to get passengers and forget your ticket routes, who cares if you lose points from them you have so many passengers! I care.

I do not care for this at all!

RATING: 8
Not as complex as I was expecting. The whole thing about transporting goods wasn't in the game, that turns out to be just marketing. The Passengers and the Passenger cards are very powerful, you can score a load of points early with them, and take points away from the others (by getting the high value first). The map is okay, but there's a lot of grey I think, and the map is unbalanced. Lots of short routes in the West get you easy Destination points and so a good crack at the 10pt bonus. Longer tracks on the right take much more work to complete, but the  4 Locos are intended for these.All in all, a good addition to the line and a great intro game for non-gamers/Marklin collectors. The packaging is aimed at them, as well as the thick DoW catalogue and the Marklin catalogue, there are 2 count them 2 discs, a Marklin CD rom and a DoW DVD!!! This game is even lusher than usual, the train cards feature a wide variety of trucks and bogeys for each colour, which confused me to begin with. I would pitch TtR Marklin between TtR and TtR Europe. It's lighter than the Europe map and not much harder than the original game. Worth buying? Yes, definitely.

Another successful sequel to the series.  The "pick up & deliver" aspect brings another solid alternate method of scoring.  Probably the most "gamey" of the 3 - but seems to drag slightly because of the longer setup and the physical picking up of the small passenger discs.  The introduction of a purple color was a nice bonus, and the card artwork is the best of the bunch.  Grade: B+

I think this deals with a lot of the balance problems in the first game.  Short routes are no longer death as you can use them for increased passenger points.  Also, building a great spanning tree to make lots of good routes is really interesting to me.

RATING: 2
Played 1 time with 2 players. I have noticed that a lot of my enjoyment of the TTR series is tied to which map I am playing: a map I am familiar with geographically (ie. North America), I like; a map of say Germany is like drinking soda that has lost its fizz. I admit that the traveller scoring is actually a piece of genius, and a great improvement over TTR's 'longest route' bonus, and TTR: Europe's various rule tweaks. Aside from that though, I just can't get into the German map (and I imagine a German might feel the same way about Omaha that I feel about Karlsruhe...) If only I could play these rules with TTR's map...

I own several of the Ticket to Rides--probably only need one, although as mentioned before, I do like the maps of different countries.

The passengers' element added to this game differs it a little from the others, but doesn't really add significantly to the basic game.

No tunnels in this one.  Two kinds of wild card locomotives--the basic one, then a 4+ which is used with trains of 5 or more in length.

This is definitely TtR for gamers, mainly due to the map, which takes some getting used to.  Also unique among the series: this one has multiple viable paths to victory, thanks to the passengers and the "Globetrotter" bonus.  I also love the train cards in this version. Still, it's not quite my favorite. I just like [thing=14996]Europe[/thing] better.

---: (this goes for all TTR games, though more present in Märklin) by the end game, luck of the draw in drawing (long) routes close to the ones you already finished is so important (in one game, a player drew 2 more 20+ points tickets close to the other long route he had already established, offering 40+ points with a minimum of effort)

Finally ended up selling this to a friend, as I could use the money.

This is my favorite Ticket to Ride (or is it Switzerland?) and I prefer it with three players.  I really like the game tight with no double routes and I like the German map.  The whole game is beautiful and the cards are really nice and full sized.  I've used it as a gateway game with and without the passengers and it was a hit both ways.

RATING: 8
Soo much better than regular ticket to ride.  I just didn't find there to be that much to do in a regular ticket to ride.  The passengers add more interaction, more things to consider when placing your routes, and better options when the cards you want up just aren't there.  Balancing all the factors isn't easy.  I can't see the rules being too complicated for a gateway game unless you're playing with your grandmother.  

I think this is the first ticket to ride I will actually suggest.

It's Ticket to Ride so it's bound to be good.  New map, new interesting possibilities.

RATING: 6
The best of the bunch? Conceptionally, it's a bit better than both US and European edition, at least. The passengers add another way to score points, and discourage the hoarding of cards at the beginning to some extent.
A game with four players was a pretty relaxed affair. While not exactly empty, the map certainly felt less crowded than I'd expect from the US map, for example. For casual gamers that might be a plus, people who like it more cutthroat might want to stick to playing with five only.

One of the first Eurogames bought after joining BBG.  All players were slightly underwhelmed, and the pieces were just a bit too fiddly for us newbies. Leaves one feeling that it is not as good as it should have been. If we are to TTR, we tend to just play the original Ticket to Ride with 1910 expansion (which were bought later, as by then, the board game bug had well and truly bitten) (18/12/08). UPDATE: Probably will eventually get back to it in the family context (Rating 5.382, Jan 17)

A very good implementation of Ticket to Ride. I'm not a big fan of the original game as it's a little too straightforward for my interests these days.  But a few extra things are thrown into Marklin that do increase the strategy quite a bit.  A nice piece of push-your-luck timing on when to send your passengers across the routes. Of course, not getting the timing right can potentially put you back quite a bit on points, so that's something to be wary of.  It feels a little easier to complete Route cards on this map, but the map is so tight that it balances itself out. There's enough screwage in this game too that might get you angry, so be aware! Overall, perhaps one of the best implementations of the TtR series.  'Europe' might be best for a mix of gamers and casual players, but Marklin is best for those gamers who want a real challenge in an otherwise simple game.

RATING: 8
I enjoy TTR for its satisfying set collection and the conflict that arises unintentionally throughout the game.  I think its these factors that make the game a perfect gateway game: its familiar, yet you get some of the same feeling you would from games rely on direct conflict.  Also the bits are appealing.

The main draws of the Marklin edition over others, from what I can gather, is the artwork on the cards and the addition of the passengers.  While I'm indifferent with regards to the artwork, I find the passengers to be too much work to set up for what they provide.  They add a little complexity to the TTR gameplay, but if you're looking for complexity why are you playing TTR at all?

I like the German map a lot with 4 or 5 players, but with 3 or less there isn't enough tension.  With higher numbers the center of the country becomes a battleground, leaving short-but-sure routes on the west and the exclusively long routes in the east.

Similar to it's predecessors but adds an element that brings both a new sense of timing and optional scoring to the game.

However, I think the American map is still my favorite (how I wish it wasn't so).

Ticket to Ride: Märklin Edition feels like an upgraded TtR USA and an excellent alternative to TtR Europe. 
It has more tension than any other game in the series, since you can block and be blocked for good and it is definitely the most balanced TtR thanks to the map layout (featuring 12 routes longer than 4 spaces, as opposed to 17 in the original and just 3 in TtR Europe) and to the different sets of tickets (23 short and 23 long tickets). 
The unique passenger mechanic is ingenious and adds  depth to the game, since at least 1/3 of the final score is normally given by passengers.
Only negative aspects are the longer and fiddly setup of the goods chits and the somewhat "unfriendly" color mix of the new train cards (which in exchange feature beautiful pictures of Märklin train models).
Definitely my favourite version of TtR!

TTR in Germany. Some like the "Marklin" design. Others don't. I do like it although the colors are less distinctive than in TTR, but that is not the point : the game plays well, is harder than TTR because of those country dead ends (France, Austria etc.) and offers new scoring opportunities thanks to the passengers mechanism. A challenging alternative to the regular TTR.

Maybe it's because I played Canal Mania right before finally getting a chance to play this newest version of Ticket to Ride.  Whatever the reason, I am feeling a little lukewarm towards Marklin.  In concept, I like the idea of the passengers, and I like how each town has a different value, a la Elfenland   Elfengold, and that the value goes down whenever a passenger passes through.  It felt a little tacked on in this TtR remix, so for now I have to say I prefer the original.  If I want something a little heavier, I will turn to Canal Mania.  I would still like to try TtR: Europe, and I am more than happy to give Marklin a few more plays.  As for production, the cards are very nice looking, but the board is completely bland in comparison to the other Ticket to Ride games. Update: This game is far more interesting with more than two players I think.  I am liking the game more now, as there is plenty of room for brutal play and the press your luck aspect of the passengers is fun, despite it feeling a little tacked on.

I have played this now twice as a three player and it doesn't seem very balanced that way. One player usually get's one portion of the map to himself and the other two have to fight... so the player who don't have to fight usually wins. It's really cutthroat as well. Next time will be with 4 or 5 players.

More of a game for gamers than the original.  More balanced with the passenger tokens to pick up for points, with more points along the shorter routes and with the bonus points now going to the most tickets instead of the longest route. I think that change should be used in the other TTR games as a house rule without question.

I'm sure we've played it more than twice - it was one of the more-oft played games in my house until we bought pandemic and power grid (we hardly play anything else but those two now).  Some find the passengers feature finicky (and it is, for setting up the board), but for me, that extra gameplay makes it love this variant of TtR more than the two other ones I have played.

RATING: 7
So far, I would rate TTR:Märklin substantially below the original TTR but very slightly above TTR:Europe.  Märklin's most noticeable flaw is that it does not scale well.  The game plays poorly with 2 and 4 players because completing a North-South backbone is too easy, and therefore playing "balls out" for the long tickets overwhelms other strategies.  With 3 or 5, though, there appears to be a nice balance of strategies.  The game plays especially well with 5, which is the weakest configuration for the original TTR.The game loses a half-point because I don't get a pleasant, harmonious feeling from the game's components and appearance.  Physically, Märklin falls short of its predecessors in almost every area: the busier, muted, less iconic cards, the more parochial map, the plastic score markers, the bothersome passenger score markers.  All of this makes the game a little less enjoyable than it should be.

I love the additional options and features compared to standard TTR. Tickets divided into groups, passengers, dead ends, 4-plus engines, triple parallel tracks, and so on. I will need to get the hang of when to use the passengers if I'm going to win though. And keeping two long overlapping route tickets at the start doesn't seem to be the best strategy -- especially when a high number of completed routes will get you the bonus. Plays best with 3-5.

There is an added pick-up and delivery element to the game where players are moving passengers. The rules associated with that aren’t hard even though the game takes a little longer to set up. Along with a choice of taking either longer or shorter routes it adds a lot of space for decisions. It makes the game less casual, but also more interesting. Some other maps have rules changes that don’t make that much of a change, but I think it works pretty well here and are well thought through.

Great game.  The passengers add a level of complexity in terms of the thought that goes into your moves, but not in difficulty of play.  The game is just a smidgen harder to understand than the original Ticket to Ride (which means that it is not hard at all).  Good addition to the franchise!

We very much enjoy the addition of the passenger mechanic. It adds a lot to the game. However we feel it needed to be implemented differently. The little merchandise tokens are fiddly and tend to skate across the board. They also add a lot of time to setup and take down. If we stop playing it will be because of these. 

Dividing the tickets into large and small is great and is implemented much better than it was in Europe.

And the train cards are gorgeous!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The passenger mechanism is an interesting addition, as are the +4 joker cards. Having separate piles for small or large tickets is an improvement too. Highly recommended if you enjoyed the original Ticket to Ride, though as before it gets a bit more cut-throat with 5 players.

Cool game and it has my wifes home town, so I'm ever hopeful that she will want to play. False hope 8-(.  Stupid fiddly passenger point tokens are a major pain and a major downfall to the game. No stations either like in TTR:E. Yellow is the best colour. Always collect the yellow cards.

RATING: 7.5
Another really interesting ticket to ride version. The map is very nice and the graphic design is much more moderns instead of ttr's traditional 19th century style. Passengers add an interesting twist to the strategy. I really like the fact that some tickets are international and allow you to choose whichever end station you want as long as its in the right country.

RATING: 9
Marklin is a unique map variant for Ticket to Ride. Released early on, Marklin doesn't have tunnels or ferries, but instead has passengers. Points tokens are placed in each city for your passengers to collect as the game progresses. The first person to travel through a city gains the highest value token. Making this more interesting, the map is more asymmetrical than others. The SW is full of very short "grey" routes with medium-high valued passenger tokens, while the NE is full of long routes with low value passenger tokens (with the exception of Berlin, the most valuable).  The map scales very well, and encourages getting trains out quickly to set up a high-scoring passenger run. Very easy to read, the German cities are simpler to find and locate compared to the Nordic and Swiss maps. One of the most different maps, Marklin feels unique in its Ticket to Ride interpretation. Highly recommended.

A nice little variant. Harder for me because I don't know German geography. The passengers are a very exciting addition and really add a lot to the gameplay. The map is probably not quite as good as the USA map in terms of gameplay, though. I also don't particularly care for the "model train" theme. Still, a very good game, similar enough to the original that it isn't a high priority for me to buy.

RATING: 8
This is Ticket to Ride with the added element of passengers and passenger cards.  Our family enjoys this one.  Our only frustration is that the passenger disks are small and tough to pick up after the board starts to fill up with trains.  However, this is balanced by the multiple ways in which to score points.  The winner can be a surprise when routes are scored at the end.

I think that Bruno Faidutti might have it right on the mark when he states that the best version of TTR is the original version with the 1910 expansion. Marklin seems to have more decisions to make, but the additional complexity seems to be out of place for a game which is meant to be simple. In other words, while I appreciate the additional elements, if I am looking for a more complex route building game I'd rather reach for On the Undergroud (or non-train games like Powergrid or Maharaja) rather than a more complex version of TTR.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun Stuff! I really enjoy the passengers and that they got rid of the station houses. It's much more cut-throat now. I also like that there are many more long routes. It makes it less predictable and more varied strategically. 

I have changed my rating from 9 to 7. The game is fun, but it feels a bit like the game is playing you not the other way around. I also don't think that three player is much fun, two is so-so and five is a bit long...
Four player is really fun, though.

Standard issue TTR, except you can choose between short and long routes and grab and keep as many as 4. I love that element of the game and varying up the strategy.

Also approve of the change from longest route to most routes for the point bonus.

Rated 7 as I both like and dislike elements of this. Picking up the passanger points makes a nice change (and much deeper element than the longest route dynamic) but with it creates a game which is much bittier and more difficult to explain to newcomers used to light games.

On balance I like and dislike it as much as Europe though neither matches up to USA/1910.

Edit: Rerated to 9, it's passenger mechanic replacing the longest route is an excellent idea (though like I say quite bitty and more complicated) - the mechanic balances nicely against my normal TTR build 6 tactics by benefitting players that build long routes, going through lots of cities and requiring short trains. Thus it balances everything and makes a fantastic game

After one play of the Marklin edition, I must say I have mixed feelings about it. Perhaps my session went too long (nearly an hour and a half) for such a medium weight game. Overall, I feel the simplicity and beauty of the original is lost in this version. The setup of tiny number tokens stacked on top of each other is simply ridiculous and the added passenger cards (along with theirr passengers) is something I am just not fond. I did use them to my advantage in the game, making three profitable runs. However, I think I would prefer to play the Marklin edition without the passengers, the tokens, and the cards. I do like, however, the division of short and long routes, as it adds a strategic aspect to the  game. I also like the addition of the  10 for the most destination cards completed, but wonder if that creates too much of an advantage to that strategy. I would like to see th ebonus for longest route be awarded in addition to the most destination cards. I don't see myself wishing to play this often.

I love the Ticket to Ride series and the production values of Days of Wonder.  I prefer Europe slightly to Marklin, but the new passenger element is refreshing.  Can be fiddly with all of the point pieces and it seems like the game is tilted to passenger scoring and a little out of balance.  It will take a few more plays to figure that out, though.  Very good game.

The map was pretty tight and competitive.  I didn't like the tickets--it seemed like most of them weren't worth anything, so it was difficult to make much progress at all.  But at this point TTR is TTR to me.  (1 play)

Marklin is easily the best of the Ticket to Rides to date.  The passenger mechanic is a very clever and needed addition to the core aspects of the system.  The production quality and design in general seem to have been pretty streamlined to work out most of the minor kinks that annoyed me in the first two games.  I also appreciate the added strategies of long Eastern routes versus short Western routes, or a hybrid of the inbetween.  -Very well done.

The dynamics build a lot of anxiety while somehow transforming that experience into an enjoyable one. Play is always a bit longer than I expect, because the amount of fun makes time fly game after game. I have experienced every available strategy score a win at some point.

RATING: 6
Played this first time as a three-player which is always tough as TtR is definitely the most cutthroat with 3, owing to the fact that the double routes are still closed.  Even accounting for this I think that this version is the most mean I have played, there are a few ways in which you can really hurt your opponents chances.

The main difference between this one and the original is that there are stacks of point scoring tiles on the cities which you can pick up by passing your passenger through them on your turn.  Your passenger can move along your routes, but also a limited distance along your opponents' routes, depending on what cards you have in hand.  This is where I think the game becomes very cutthroat, as you opponent doesn't need to have even built his trains through the 'good' places on the board, he can simply wait for you to do so and then just move his passenger and take all the points.  This is the main reason I wouldn't recommend this version for families, but otherwise it introduces some nice decisions and really stokes up the competition - which is great.

This is probably my favorite version of Ticket to Ride. I started off playing Ticket to Ride: Europe but enjoy this one more as it's lacking the train stations and the game feels more cut throat. The passengers also allow for some unique scoring and add some fun surprises to the overall game. They can be very powerful.

I also enjoy the artwork in the game and the uniqueness of each train card.

RATING: 6.5
A bit heavier than TTR and TTR: Europe thanks to passengers, but still light and fun.
The map is quite tight and the passengers require attention so you draw new tickets quite rarely (if at all) - contrary to TTR: Europe.  This is a paradox as Marklin version was specifically created with the 'draw more tickets than usual' intention...

EDIT: It has worn out for me after several plays.  Also, these passengers making the game more interesting (and tense) at first, diminish my fun from the game now.  Drawing too little additional tickets because of them becomes annoying...

Sold.

I've seen others say it can be a bit unbalanced as well...

Another rehash?  Well...yes but this is a little better than even the original. The original was a little unbalanced between the long and short routes but this version fixes that. The passengers are neat, you just need to keep up. I found the game to be a little more tense than the original too.

This may be the best of the TTR series to date.  I really like the passenger additions.  It's a whole new layer of strategic decision making.  I much prefer the +10 for completing tickets as opposed to the longest train.  The 'stations' are gone so this version can be a bit nastier if people choke off route options on you, and that's good I think.  Thumbs up from me on Marklin.

Has everything it needs to be a real 'gamers' version of T2R, and I generally enjoy this one the best out of all the versions.

Ticket To Ride focuses on Germany with one more mechanic: passengers that are worth points when picked up. However, this picking up for points along routes is a distraction from the main play of the game. Most of the time, you are focused on completing routes for points, not these extra items.

PLUS: new map, new mechanic
MINUS: new mechanic doesn't interact well with the base game

The passengers are a wonderful addition, each giving as many points as a ticket (if well played).  I enjoy the game mechanics much more than in Europe (and in Europe more than in US), all around an excellent addition to the franchise, but not quite remarkable enough to want to own it as well as another version.

Bought for the beautiful art (model trains = cool).  An excellent game too.  Passengers are a fiddly addition; a good idea but picking up the tokens without knocking over trains is tricky, and set-up time is significantly lengthened.  Always fun.

Only played two games of this so far.  I've played the original TTR online and was not that impressed; it seamed a bit too light.  But the passengers in this edition add another element and the chance to choose long or short route destination tickets makes strategising different.  I'll see if it keeps our attention or just collects dust before altering my rating for this game.

Edit: 1/4/09
Played a three player version of this the other night with a newbie and my girlfriend.  My girlfriends response: "this game is way better than I remember it being.  How come we don't play this more often?".  I reckon it's about to get a lot more plays around our table.  
I agree with people who say the passengers confuse a newbie, but what game out there gives a newbie a legitimate chance to win on their first play?  You're right: zero.  I've never introduced someone to a game and had them win on their first play.  Wait, scratch that, Settler's and Carcassonne are two exceptions (only because we tend to let the newbie have whatever they need, etc).  Back to TTR, the scores were incredibly close throughout the game, typically only 3 or 4 points spread between all three of us.  That openned up a bit at the end when the tickets were cashed in.  I did win, but only because I took better advantage of the passenegrs (used all three of mine versus everyone else only using one).  I won by a paltry 20 points, about the value of my second passengers fare.  Watch this page, as I expect my raiting to steadily increase.  Have not yet experienced TTR: Europe, but Marklin is far superior to the original.  After one play, the passengers make sense.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Another very good variation on the basic TTR system. Today it could be published as part of the map collection. 

The main difference is the introduction of passengers. Each city starts with a varying amount of chits worth between 2-7 victory points. Three times in the game, players can place a passenger at one end of a track just built. As a new action, a traveller can be used once to travel from one end of a player's tracks to the other and pick up a victory chit in each city on the way. Other changes are the award based on the number of completed tickets and new joker types in the train deck.

The passengers add a second race to the game that can earn players 20-30 VPs per passenger, too many to be neglected. The necessary trade-off decision adds depth to the game without introducing much rules overhead. Short routes gain importance as they can provide a huge boost in passenger VPs (Ruhrgebiet). The map is really tight with three or five players. Two and four are more relaxing, making ticket-based strategies more feasible.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Better than the original. Passengers are way more fun than longest road. I've seen many different strategies win it. Also like the new 4+ wilds. Only think that all those single spaces in a 3 player game are extra brutal.

I don't dislike the game, but this is my least favorite of the three.

RATING: 7.5
The major problem here is that the game is won by drawing additional Destination cards towards the end of the game, and then culling through them to find matches you have already completed.  The risks of doing this are much smaller than the huge rewards.  This fact obviates most of the action earlier in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A nice variation on the TtR theme, the passengers add an extra way to score points and also can screw up the best laid plans for getting the lines one needs.  An interesting map with the 7 length routes and triple routes.  Well done!

Very good game, but here is my "complaint"  The game has all the fun of standard Ticket to Ride, but now it has an added layer of anxiety on top.  While this makes for harder decisions, I am not sure I like having more  of this sort of "pain" in a Ticket to Ride game.

RATING: 7
Wow - I got absolutely worked in my first play, I almost got lapped, and I had over 100 points!  Note to self: do not keep all four of your initial tickets, especially if you draw two long tickets and two shorts.  It is obvious that I will need to formulate a different strategy than in the regular TtR game.  Do not underestimate the value of the passengers either, that is a great mechanism which discourages card hoarding.  My opponents scored some huge passenger bonuses because I was too busy picking up cards to plan these long routes that didn't pay off all that well.  This is a good reworking of the game, which I probably like more than the original.  It still seems like it takes a little too long, and like everyone says, setting up and taking down is much more of a pain because of those little counters.

Update: When teaching new players, one cannot underestimate the strength of the passengers.  This is nice because it thwarts the "draw/draw/draw" strategy that I usually use, laying down entire routes after building up a mountain of cards.  This is also a good way to learn geography - everything I know about German geography is from playing boardgames!

Nice improvements over the original TTR.  I was a little burned out on the original, but I could handle playing this one a few more times.  However, even though there are improvements, it's still too similar to justify owning a copy of both.  If I bought Marklin, Ticket to Ride would just never get played.  Maybe I'll have to work out a trade of some kind.

I love this one.  We play often without the passengers.  I love that there is so many long tickets and short tickets that no one really knows for sure which tracks you are working on.  I like the passenger portion, except they are a bit difficult to pick up the point values without messing up the board.

Ticket to Ride with 1910 expansion trumped this one, downgraded rating.

Based on 25+ plays.  Marklin continues to improve upon the TtR series.  The two sets of tickets, the bonus for most completed tickets, and the passengers are all nice improvements.  The latter are particularly nice, because they help balance out the point differential between the long and short routes.  Unfortunately, the washed-out color scheme on the train cards  isn't very appealing, and the black train card and the locomotive are too similar.  Also, the merchandise chits are quite fiddly and begging to be lost.  Still, these complaints are minor compared to the overall enjoyability of the game.

Jogo fantástico, concordo com as demais pessoas que afirmam em dizer que esta é a melhor versão dos Tickets to Ride, realmente muito dinâmico o uso do passageiro e dos pontos que se ganha com esta mudança. Pontos negativos ao meu ver são as cartas de vagões que tornam um tanto confusa para quem é abituado com a versão Europe de conseguir distiguir em primeira instância os vagões das locomotivas (cartas coringa), que muitas são bem parecidas... um detalhe que pode passar despercebido é a presença de propagandas nas cartas de vagões... que são todas muito bonitas e realistas

Similar to other Ticket to Ride games but, like Switzerland, dealing with geography can make the game more difficult for some.

The passenger mechanic is new and requires more diligence than previous TTR mechanics (such as the train station in TTR: Europe).

I'm not all atwitter about the passenger/merchandise mechanic.  It doesn't feel to me, YET, like this really complements the other aspects of the game nicely; it feels tacked on and nonessential.  But, it's nice to have a variety of maps to play on, and the production values are among the most gorgeous of any game I own.

A good game, this does add more strategy to the game.  The downside is that timing becomes much more critical and you will have a strong disadvantage if you run your passenger loads too late.  When playing with a more serious gaming group this is better than the original...

In some ways I really liked this TTR but it was terribly hard for those I played with to keep track of the city names.  I enjoyed the routes that connected to countries but the point token twist of this one was just ok and we found it hitting the table the least of our massive TTR collection at the time.

This was my first introduction to the Ticket to Ride series.  I like the game and the passengers were interesting, but after thrifting the original Ticket to Ride I didn't feel like it was different enough for me to need two versions of the same game so I traded this one away.

RATING: 8
Ticket to Ride with some extra rules.
Personally I don't think the extra rules add much to the experience, as opposed to Ticket to Ride Europe where the extra rules do fix what some people think are problems with the original.
The new rules are OK, but one of the reasons I like Ticket to Ride is its simplicity.  Marklin is still a very good game, but the extra rules move it down a notch compared to the original for me.

Another version of Ticket to Ride, it still has the strengths of the core game but shakes things up with a few more alterations than the average Ticket to Ride expansion.

The big twist in this version are the passengers which players can move along their own routes to collect goods tokens (worth points) off of cities that they pass over. I think this addition is OK but I don’t feel that it adds much to the game and deploying them well does require some attention and forward planning which helps to make this version slightly less suited for families and non-gamers compared to other Ticket to Ride games.

I do quite like the other smaller tweaks this game offers however. First of all, I like how this version has separate stacks for short and long destination tickets. This gives players more control over the types of tickets they end up with.

Secondly, this is (I think) the first version  of the game that uses the ‘Globe Trotter’ bonus for the player who completes the most destination tickets as an alternative to the normal longest train bonus. I think this is a great change as it gives more incentive to go for more tickets rather than likely further rewarding players who have scored fewer longer links (which are inherently worth more points already). 

Finally, I think the map is a nice change from the others available. I think the asymmetric setup (with a high concentration of cities and short links in the southwest) combines with the passengers, the ‘Globe Trotter’ bonus, and separate ticket stacks to provide an interesting choice of viable strategy options ranging from going for many short tickets and lots of passenger points to going for mostly long links and long ticket points.

Wins (3/7).
I feel this is the best ticket to ride yet. 
My only problem is that when you are playing against a couple and they decide not to block each other. This game turns into a luck dependant game. I allready find the extra draw for destination tickets questionable. And even while you start the game this can have a big influence on the outcome. I don't think that there are enough alternatives to reach some cities in a 3P game. The game is liked by none gaming friends also and for that I have to score it above a 7. I just ordered some other train games and I hope they will replace this one. Allthough I am allways willing to play I feel there are much more games out there that are more worthy of my freetime.
Recommended to introduce NGF to the hobby. So great gateway game.
Recommended when everyone is willing to  block other players. If they don't  I give this a 2.

Feels a lot of like regular TtR or TtR Europe, but the passengers makes game better. I'm  not sure if I like this 'short and long route' -system, but we'll see that later. The new cards just looks great! After playing these over 10 games I'm sure, that I'll keep a copy of mine, but I still like the original edition much better and smoother. If the original edition with 1910 expansion is not enough for you, then this one is the next one you should buy - definitely. Europe, Switzerland, Pohjoismaat... I've played all of them.

It's like Carcassonne: the castle. Take a light gateway classic, try to add some more complexity and depth but keep the luck factor. It works, it's still Ticket to Ride but the added complexity just don't result in added entertainment. It's a good game but I prefer the other versions.

Played once.  I liked this better than TtR, but not more than TtR Europe.  I thought it was as good as Europe, though.  The real improvement is that there are simply more options to score points, although, as in the other two games, tickets were worth far more than any other method.

Another beautifully produced Days of Wonder and Alan Moon game.  Several new twists to the Ticket To Ride series of games where this one adds a very special dimension of transporting Passengers.  Passengers can be a good chunk of your scoring so it can be very important to nail down your trains/network as early as possible to begin passenger runs.  Any delay could cause others to snap up those passenger tokens before you do (they're worth more the earlier you can snatch them).  I favor playing this with five players which has lots of interaction and fighting for rail lines.  With three or four, I find that one of the better strategies (if not optimal) is to start with long tickets and to connect the longer eastern rail links (5, 6 & 7 links give you larger points) and then send one or possibly even two passengers as early as possible (especially thru Berlin).  This is a more "advanced" version of the three T2R games to date.

Played a few times now and it was always fun but ... it would be nice to have more than one board to play on and that's not possible in this version. So I might end up buying one of the other versions to be able to buy some extra boards as well.
This version has the adaptation of adding passengers to the original game and they do make a difference. Deny them en you'll loose for sure

I think this game would be a lot more enjoyable with less than 6 players, as there is a lot of down-time, which makes it less enjoyable.

Really not necessary! The original with p&p net maps/cards is more than enough.

However... the new mechanism is cool as heck, and growing on me! I love running the passengers, even though it is awkward to place them on the board so as not to cover up the city name. The tiny thin number chits are so difficult for me to handle that I downgrade this game a full point (in this case, from 7 to 6). Thicker chits next time, please! These things are difficult to setup and harder to pull from the board with my overdry, thick, sandpapery fingies!

This is a clear step up from Ticket to Ride. The passengers make hoarding cards until the end less of a clear winning strategy.

I love the passengers....I love the streamlined board.....I even love the new ticket system and the elimination of the longest route for most tickets completed; but for some reason I feel like the +4 Locos spoil the game, at least with 3 players.

Update:

Much better with more than 3 players. Will have to try 3 again and see if strategy was the flaw.

Update:

No flaws here. It's just a deeper version of ticket that take more learning to understand the nuances of the map.

Entry level train/rummy game with some twists. More gamery than TTR or TTR: Europe due to the passengers but easy to pick up. Be careful with sensitive souls since inadvertantly (or purposefully) blocking them out of a city might damage their fragile psyche.

Another fine Ticket to Ride game. Though with this one I feel it's a bit overproduced. I could do without all the different pictures on the cards. Sure they are pretty but they are kind of distracting. Also mildly frustrating was pulling ticket cards when I needed train cards. But I guess that's just part of the game and I did make use of them before the end. All in all I think the passengers takes something away from the simple pleasures of the Ticket to Ride series.

The Passenger element makes it feel too fiddly FOR SOME FOLKS and takes away from it being a gateway accessible game. Others seem to like to more over the original TTR.

See: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/215573/ticket-to-ride-marklin-why-more-is-less

A heavier version of TTR. Worth considering if TTR seems too boring or basic. 
See: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/443077/ticket-to-ride-marklin-compared-to-the-original-an

Preferred by some (due to the use of passengers and merchandise element): http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/331355/best-of-the-ttr-series-if-you-have-the-patience

CONCLUSION: This definitely is a wonderful addition to the TTR series. The passenger element adds strategy and a great deal of fun; especially the vying for points/merchandise before other players take it. The game is definitely worth getting for the passenger element alone.

Takes longer to set up, but the passengerrules work well and is an interesting addition to the game.
In this edition, drawing from the pile is worse than in the others, since you can also draw passenger-cards, and you probably don't want that.
There are no tunnels, but the luck-factor is still higher than in the basic game, because of the +4 jokers.
I also think this edition has the most interesting map - with both very long routes and lots of tiny grey double and triple routes.

This is proabably my pick for the best of the Ticket to Ride series.  It adds passengers, which add a whole new level of strategy to setting up your routes.  Also adds a nice dilemma of "when to use the passengers".

I love the addition of passengers in this game - it makes for a lot more difficult decisions. Unfortunately, the setup time is considerably longer than other TTR games so it gets a lot less play (even though the set-up time, in comparison to other games, is really not that bad). This is probably the best in the TTR series for gamers.

Another Ticket to Ride game, this one doesn't use the new rules of Europe but adds passengers in a new mechanism. It's interesting and sure to create a competition around point tokens but is flawed in 2p games.

I have played Ticket to Ride, Ticket to Ride Europe and now I bought TTR Marklin and to our opinion it's the more sophisticated one, i.e. the more complex and a little artificial in the sense that is not so spontaneous like the other two we played before.

RATING: 5
[Played 3 times]
The best one of the trilogy, due to an interesting map and more tactic extra rules (Passengers, "+4" Locomotives, double deck of tickets) compared to the boring US map or the luckfest European rules.
The different artwork for each card is a nice touch.
However, it's still (only) Ticket to Ride.

RATING: 8.5
Exceptional intermediate difficult  game. Easy rules. 
The destination tickets are an acceptable luck factor 
Best of the TtR series IMO :
1) differentiation between long vs short routes ; diminishes the luck factor in comparison with other TtR games
2) optimal timing to use your passenger is a thrilling strategical challenge. 
 There is a very good 2 player variant ; each player takes 2 colours but only one set of 4 cards to begin with.End game scoring is done with your baddest colour. Now, with your 2 company's you can block  one route ! 

+ scales very well ; 2- 5 players
 you always have to take calculated risks if you want to win.
->Plays better with 'Warehouses and depots' (1912) expansion. 
->Together with Alvin&Dexter the whole game is going crazy, but tons of fun.
Watch out for the passengers, depots and Alvin&Dexter !
- if you want zero luck this game isn't for you ; 
with experienced players this game is in fact a typical 'push your luck' game : how many tickets dare you take ? more than the other players ? how long do you wait to complete  a route  ? do you want to get one more  train card with the risk of being blocked ?

quotation is for the base game with mentioned expansions ; but then you have a really complicated game !

I really enjoy playing 2 player Marklin with the big cities variant.

Pros
Passengers are lots of fun.
4+ wild cards.
Long train lengths.
The map is really nice, pronouncing names of places badly.
Connecting to countries.

Cons
Blocking the mother of your children getting to France can end in a night on the couch.

The main selling point of Ticket to Ride is its simplicity. This version staples on some complexity, which defeats the purpose in my honest opinion. The ticket to ride mechanic is a bit played out, since most versions (classic and Europe) pretty much saturated it. All in all, unless you're an hardcore Ticket to Ride fan, I'd steer clear from this one.

The passengers add a nice bit of new strategy to the game.  There are also wild cards that can only be used on long (4+ length) trains that are cool.

Although the divided distribution of short and long routes and (especially) the addition of passengers certainly improve the game, they also introduce a subjectively equal amount of fiddliness - I guess this makes the Europe version my favorite of the three Tickets to Ride.

Received as a X-mas present from my in-laws (Dec. 2006). This is a nifty little variation on the T2R system. I like the passengers (the tokens are a annoyingly fiddly). I really like the new locomotive plus-4 cards. I was hesitant to add this to my collection, but now I'm glad I have it. There's a lot to like here. Good game. Last played with the family on 1/14/2007 (Michael 206/Lyssa 184/Meredith 151/Kathryn 119).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This one is rough.  Not for the faint of heart or the non-competitive gamer.  The passenger aspect of the game, as well as the lack of stations, inspires cut-throat game play.  If this is your thing, have at it.  If you're looking for a recreational game to play on a Saturday night with non-gamer friends, stay away.

Overall, besides additional setup time over the other TtR games, this is likely my favorite base game so far (TtR: Europe may be better when Europe 1912 is added).  The passenger addition is well thought out and adds another level of complexity to the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is a great one.  I love the dynamics that the passengers add.  The TtR series is a great one, because each game is different.  I like Marklin better than Europe.  USA I like because it's easier to introduce to people.  But Marklin is my favorite right now.  For the amount of luck involved in the game I still really have fun playing it.

Second play was better.  Sub'd dice for all token stacks except 2's and 7 so it was less fiddly.  Very crowded board, even for just 3 players--big change over USA board!   

We just got this and have only played once.  It seemed to take FOREVER!  We found the little tokens fiddly--always falling over and Miles couldn't even get his fingers in there to pick them up.  Plus we were such idiots we couldn't find the cities, couldn't figure out the cards, just whined and whined!  Wah wah baby carrots! I did read a tip to replace the tokens with dice and I bought the dice so when we have time this weekend we'll give it another chance.  But we were seriously disappointed in that first play.

"Perfection is not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to be taken away". In this light, the addition of passengers and special locomotives in the Märklin Edition makes it certainly less perfect than the basic game.

On the other hand, the division between long and shorter routes is something that really cannot be left out! Getting good routes no longer depend on cheer luck; you can choose between short routes that are easy to complete or longer routes that yield more points.

La mejor versión de Ticket to Ride, porque la existencia de "pasajeros" abre una nueva veta estratégica. Además, vuelve en gloria y majestad la posibilidad de quedar absolutamente bloqueados, lo que se había perdido, lamentablemtne, con la versión de Europa. Esto crea la tensión que es muy bienvenida.

1 play:  Enjoyed this more than the traditional TTR.  The passengers are an interesting addition and add some orthogonal scoring opportunities.  Again, the crux of the game lies in memorizing routes and getting long track sections, but the additional stuff is easy to use and interesting.

Based on 2 plays.I want to like it more, but I liked the simplicity of the original and didn't care much for Europe or Switzerland either.
What I don't like: 
1 Set up time is now an issue.  Sorting out all of those little cardboard discs (which are sure to go missing eventually) is a real pain.
2 The colours on the cards are hard to tell apart.  There should have been a different (limited edition) set for the Markin trainspotters.
3 There are no pictures on the board.  It looks like one of those homemade boards.  Either they were trying to cut costs or they had to rush it out.
4 The board is now portrait.  It's not the right was up whichever side of the table you are sitting.
5 A couple of countries give the impression that routes can continue through them and it's hard to remember that this is not the case.
6 The discs are too small and fiddly to pick up resulting in trains being knocked over.
That may all seem very picky.  I'm not out to slate the game - the original is my all time favourite game, played nearly every day of the week.  This maybe part of the problem since I know the board and tickets inside out and it just feels comfortable and natural to play.
I'm hoping it will grow on me as I learn the tickets and weird place names.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Marklin is more chaotic than the original, and a bit less polished than Europe; sitting in that funny middle spot usually means I'd prefer to play one of the others, but there's no real downside -- it's a fantastic game.

I like the dynamic the passengers add to the game, especially because they introduce substantial score swings if they're used well. And like Europe, long routes are less important than they are in vanilla TTR -- another bonus.

---

There's nothing wrong with TTR Marklin, but I'd never choose it over Nordic Countries, Europe, or the base game, so off it goes. Sold.

Passengers are a nice play on the longest route bonus absent from this versin of TtR. But all in all, I think I am pretty much done with the series.

3 / 5 - Good.

It's Ticket to Ride again. The passengers do add a some interesting extra strategy - it's viable for the first time to scale back on routes, because there's enough extra points from the passengers if you're careful. I also think the modern-style art is better than the rather twee artwork in previous TtR offerings. On the flipside I don't much care for playing on a map of Germany and the setup is much more fiddly than the other games. On final assessment there's not enough new here to make this worthwhile if you already own one in the series, but if you don't, this might be the one to get.

Good game.  I like the breakdown of long vs short routes and the addition of scoring points with passenger transit.  This is really tough with 3 players, because there are many double and triple tracks in congested areas of the board which become singles with 3 or fewer players.  Set up and tear down is kind of a pain - I'm always worried I'll lose a passenger scoring token.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A good game but FIDDLY with a captial F. The passenger tokens are the main culprit. Also, the long routes all seem to line up in general thus it's easy to make a lot of them. Traded away because I don't see myself ever wanting to play this over the basic TTR which I enjoy a lot.

After my first play I can say this is a game I enjoy, it has a lot of luck, yes, the setup can be long, true, but the passengers add great theme and an important timing element to the game. Also the train cards and the box artworks are really good! the map is not that pretty but is clear and functional. A light game but a good one! Want to play it soon.

Clearly I've been underestimating the power of passenger cards and also using my passengers too early or just too late when there is nothing left, you need to manage your ticket strategy better than your rivals and try to use all three passengers on time. Confirmed, for a very brief game as is, luck can be managed and it's possible to find a few consistent ways to victory. A keeper for sure. To ease the setup on the board, consider using color-faced dice instead of those painful merchandise coins, only put the single '2' ones. Very fun game, I like it a lot.

Great game board and cards for the Germanophile and Märklin train set nostalgist that I am.  I've found this game easy to teach and am making some converts!

I like the train pictures a lot, not so great are the light weight of the train cars and merchandise chips which can be tricky to handle when claiming routes and sending passengers on trips.

Something I dislike about this game is that it is hard to keep track of how well the players are doing--about half of the points are scored from destination tickets that are kept secret, the merchandise trip results have to be written down, and each player has about 12-16 open scoring plays per game, and we never fail to miss points on the track as routes are being claimed. It always comes down to a a few minutes of score keeping at the end of the game.  As a friend said to me, it's designed more like a computer game than a board game!

Game in a Nutshell: Same Ticket to Ride with a few tweaks; most predominately passengers which you can send along your route to pick up victory points. 

Played as: 3,5 player

Pros: The passengers add another legitimate avenue to rack up points and stay competitive and it's done in a way that's competitive: by rewarding those who travel first with more points.

Cons: The Map has not enamored me so far and I'm still working on trying to figure out exactly why. Part of me thinks it's the collection of route cards and how often it seems too easy to string many routes together rather then spreading things out and making more points of focused conflict. I would definitely add more route cards. Also, I much prefer the longest route to the most completed routes bonus; if you've completed 9 routes do you really need the extra points? I'm inclined to think the passenger cards could have been done without by replacing them with a simple action; as is, they can clog up your hand. Too bad it's not compatible with TtR: Switzerland.

Other: In fairness, I burned out on TtR long before trying this version out. While it does add some interesting new strategies, it still feels like any other TtR. I still think TTR: Europe is the best designed in the series.

Best Use: Another TtR that with a couple tweaks to shake things up if you really want to expand your TTR Collection.

The original got tiresome after many plays. This version just keeps on giving. Multiple paths to victory, and you can't choose all of them. Played with the gf's family without passengers to teach them, and they learned quickly. And subsequently bought a copy of the game too! 2012 edit - Doesn't hit the table very often anymore. But this is entirely to overplaying. Much like Settlers, after enough plays it feels a little bland.

A version of the classic gateway game that's easy enough to learn, has fun network building, but that can be quite cutthroat with an experienced group.

I bought this version because it had the more complex extra rules with Passengers, and because it doesn't include the "longest route" bonus scoring that I disliked from the original and TTR:Europe.

We play it more often as a basic TTR game than as Marklin, but it's nice to have that step up included for those who want more.

I'm not sure yet whether I prefer this one to TtR: Europe. The map strikes a good compromise between the tightness of Europe and the wide-open spaces of America. I also like the new wildcard idea and the passengers. However I find it frustratingly difficult to use the passenger correctly, and I would rather still have the 'draw 3/keep 1' mechanism instead of the new 4/2. There are different strategies to be used in here than the two previous versions, but because the old strategies also work, it is difficult to break out of the mould and try something new.Update: after 4 games, the verdict is in: I prefer TtRE. TtRM is great, but I can never activate the passengers at the right time and always finish last in points :(  It's not the game, it's me!

This is my least favorite version of TTR.  I will mostly be talking about differences from TTR, so to get a feel for it you should read my comments on the original.

In the Marklin edition a kind of pick up and deliver mechanism is added.  With the normal train cards are mixed in some passenger cards as well.  On your turn an additional option for your turn is to transport a passenger from city to city.  You can start wherever you want and moving along your own trains each city you go through you grab a chit that is worth points.  Each time a person goes through a city they make it worth less for the next person.  So a city will have chits like 5, then 4, then 3, then 2 for example.  So the first person through gets 5 points the next 4 and so on.  If you run to an end of your own trains you can use one passenger card per leg to go along other peoples' connections to score some more points by hitting more cities.

The other change is in the destination routes.  They are split into two piles, one pile are shorter low point routes and the other pile are all longer higher point routes.  When choosing destination tickets you get to choose which pile to grab cards from, and you can mix and match.  This allows you to grab some longer routes early, but as the game is nearing the end you can switch over to drawing shorter less risk routes.

I just don't like the passenger aspect of the game.  Also, even though there are short and long routes, non of them really seam as long as what they are in the previous two games.  Really they are medium and short routes.  Stick with TTR Europe.

Another great Ticket to Ride game.

Played the first time with two players and thought it was just "OK". Enough rule changes to separate it from the first two, and some new things to get used to.

Have since played with 4 players and it was a very tense & tricky game. 

The decision of whether to add more links to your route or set your passenger off before someone else grabs the best tokens .... the options of whether to go for 4 short tickets, a mixture of both, or a bunch a big trips .... and all the usual TtR dilemmas .... all go towards a great game.

Nice artwork as well, with the carriages and loco's different on every card.

Played once.  My introduction to the Ticket to Ride series; there are far too many things to do in each turn (draw cards, build track, move passengers, or draw additional tickets), and balancing the tasks is fun (if challenging).  The rules are simple, making it easy to pick up.  The stress of worrying if the route you want to build on is going to get built by someone else first makes the game very intense, if potentially a bit frustrating for those who are super-competitive.

TTR is not fun, to me.  It is a good intro game for many people, very light and easy... and it also takes a while, and unlike more complicated games, it can be PRETTY easy for people to snipe segments of track you need to finish your build.  Not fun to sit and waste a lot of time on the game anyways and then be hoodwinked at the very end.

Adjusting review from 7.0 down to 5.5 based on my changing disposition over multiple times on the table.

Sold at auction, not sorry to see it go.

Nem rossz, de nekem ez már sok a TtR családban. Az utasokra figyelés sokszor visszaüt a végén, nehéz megmondani, hogy most az a jó, ha az utassal végigharácsolom az útvonalat, vagy inkább bővítem tovább.

Az alap (USA vagy Europe) sokkal letisztultabb, ebben a kiadásban soha nem éreztem, hogy mindenképpen meg kellett volna jelentetni (szerintem nem).

TtR fanoknak természetesen kötelező darab.

Darn you to heck Mr. Moon!!!  IMHO Ticket to Ride (the original) is tied with Carcassonne as one of the best "Gateway" games out there. The mechanics are easy, the scoring is right on the board and the luck / skill balance is perfect to get someone up from Monopoly to the next level. TTR Europe is the best 4-5 player version. It is an excellent game for "gamers". Easy to pick up, but with enough twists that you won't bore a regular gamer (love the tunnels!). TTR Marklin is the best 2 player game of the series. Thoroughly enjoyable with a "tighter" board to put pressure on capturing the necessary routes to score your tickets. For that, and the fact it is easier to find 1 more gamer than 3 TTR: Marklin is the one I own. (But I want them all!!!)

Darn you Alan Moon!  Darn you to heck!!

Too long for what it is with 5 players (general problem with TtR for me), and is hit and miss with 2 players (depending on the interaction). 3 or 4 is my sweet spot with this game.

My favorite change is the separate stacks of long and short tickets.

We hummed and ha'd on this, wondering if it was too much of the same since we already have TTR. Turns out to be different enough to make it worth the purchase. Gets a ten as it is still T2R, while the extras add a little to it, the main mechanic makes this so playable.

This edition does ramp up the tension and can be very unforgiving. Tickets can be much harder to get and someone can swipe in before you with their passengers and leave you devastated. If you don't have any version of Ticket to Ride I'd suggest the original and 1910 expansion, especially if you want this to play with friends and family. This version is a better one for those already hooked on the game or people who can handle being thrashed.

Plays ok without the passengers, if you just want a normal game on a different board.

Has my preference over TTR:Europe.

The beauty of the ticket to ride series lies in it's easy to understand and jump right into it gameplay - particulalry as a gateway game for beginners.  And as a gateway game, this version adds a layer of unnecessary complexity and an altogether "not that much more fun" mechanic by introducing the passengers.

I've only played this twice so far (2 player)... but I think it's an improvement so far over Ticket To Ride. The game is better balanced and feels "tighter". There is a bit more to think about... moving passengers over many short routes vs going for longer 5-7 length routes, whether to complete several short destination routes versus a more balanced plan... say 2 shorts and a long etc.

All in all, so far generally I feel Marklin provides a bit more tension and "thinky" decisions than the original TtR did. I would still play TtR but I would prefer this on the table instead. My rating could possibly go up once I play it with 3 players as I think even more competition on the board for key routes should increase the tension in the game to even better levels.

I think this will scale even better from 3-5 players than TtR did as the board is better laid out and there seems to be more tension in trying to do "what you need to" without getting trapped and blocked off and having to re-think your strategies.

The third Ticket to Ride game that adds the following: 1) passenger tokens which take a turn to be placed, and another turn to travel on your own routes to collect victory point chips on each city. But the victory point chips are limited, and are higher in value for the earlier players to go to that city. Once used, the passengers are discarded, and each player gets three passengers 2) There is a "4" locomotive card which can be used on routes of length 4 or greater, 3) There are passenger cards which allow you to travel on opponent's routes with your passengers. 4) The 10 pt bonus is only awarded for most completed destination tickets 5) A player, when drawing destination tickets can draw from two piles - a pile of long destinations ranging from 14 to 22 VPs and a pile of short destinations, with a maximum of 14 VPs.  Since this is new, I do want to play this more often than the older Ticket to Ride games. As I play this more, I think this could be the best Ticket to Ride.

The addition of passengers, while fiddly, adds an interesting new dimension to the tried-and-true TTR gameplay. **UPDATE** What a turnaround! This went from an 8 to a 4 in one play.

The passengers is a delightful wrinkle that adds a surprising amount of extra tension to the game.  The map design is such that you can very easily feel hemmed in almost from the start, so the panic to collect and claim the lines you need happens early and often.  A great step up from classic TtR, and I think you get a bit more here compared to what was added in TtR:Europe.

Makes the game much more interesting than the original. Gameplay follows a completely different flow. Now there is incentive to start builing earlier, since you're going to want your passengers on the board. Claiming good passenger routes seems to be the key in this game. Collecting points for routes just isn't enough.

RATING: 8
The geography is similar to the USA map: you have the shortest direct route, but if blocked, there are several detours you can do. It includes country tickets from Switzerland map, the long tickets from Europe, the "Longest Route" is now the "Most Tickets" completed, and a couple of important new mechanics:
-> Locomotive +4: they can be taken as regular wagons and they can only be used in links 4 or more wagons long.
-> Goods and passenger transportation, a new way to get points that benefits those who start with short links.

This benefits for the short links are certainly welcomed. In the USA map, it is very difficult to win versus the player that include long 6 and 5 wagon links in their grid. The players with long links still have the upper hand (rightly, because their bet is also more risky), but the difference is not as huge.

As a side effect, there's much less speculation: players won't wait to claim links and there will be war since minute 1!

Maybe I will see other things and change my opinion with further plays, but today, this is my favourite TTR game!

First impression: I've played one game with 5 players. That left a feeling that the game might be better with either 3 or 4 players. Although with 4 there might be too much room but with 5 it felt a bit too crowded on board. Passengers are interesting addition but they add unnecessary layer of complexity into a TTR game.

RATING: 6
Fiddly. Takes the original TtR concept and constrains the space of the board. Adds tourists, who complicate the game. The chit stacks make the game a lot longer to set up than is necessary and could have been dealt with in a better way. Overall, though, it makes for a decent game. My least favorite in the series.

RATING: 7.5
Nice addition to the TTR franchise. The board is balanced and the passanger delivery system adds enough to the game to make it sufficiently different to other TTR incarnations. Lovely production and art, though some of the colours on the train cards aren't as clear as they could be. 

My only real concern is that the changes make the game a  more strategic, which is normally a good thing (and makes it a better game for me), but in this case takes away one of TTR's strengths which is its gateway status. It's still pretty easy to play - just not as quick or light as the original, and therefore might not see as much play as it should. (8)

Variante tedesca del classico gioco di Alan Moon. L'edizione è molto curata con carte differenti tra loro, locomotive speciali da +4, un alto numero di obiettivi e l'aggiunta della variante passeggero. Quest'ultima è l'unica vera novità di questa edizione che per il resto sfrutta idee e successo dei predecessori. Per non ritrovarsi con una mappa vuota il gioco è da 4 a 5 giocatori.

I really like the Ticket to Ride games.  Marklin is no exception.  I like the German map, and I like how the neighbouring countries' names are even written in German.

The gimmick to this edition of TTR is the passenger scoring.  Players can add a passenger to one of the cities at the end of a route they complete.  Then in a later turn, they can move the passengers along connected routes from city to city picking up numbered chits along the way, adding them to their score.

Set up time for TTR is a little longer because you have to add numbered chits to all the cities for the passenger scoring.  The chits are a little small, and can be a little cumbersome to pick up when the board is full of train pieces.  You almost inevitably disturb the board as you pick up the chits.  And explaining passenger scoring to new players can be a little difficult, but most people start to get it after they see you score with a passenger.

If you like the original TTR, then you will like the Marklin edition too.

TtR is . . . fine. Maybe I'm playing it wrong (undoubtedly, even), but it doesn't ever feel particularly interesting on the level of decision-making.

Voor de eerste keer gespeeld op 12/05/06.  Een mooie aanvulling, die passagiers.  Naar mijn menig ook een betere versie dan de Europese.  Die passiegerstransport heeft een extra dimensie, alleen spijtig dat de langste route niet meer van belang is.  Ikzelf bezit de eerste versie.  De Märklin versie is een leuke variant, maar geen must in de spellenkast, ten minste als je al een Ticket To Ride liggen hebt.  Ook een ideaal spel om mensen die nog niet vertrouwd zijn met de wondere wereld der spellen, hiermee kennis te laten maken. Speelden mee: Arnold, Daniël, Ann, Piet en ikzelf (12/05/06)

RATING: 8
What a great game!  I got my mom to go in on this with me for my brother's birthday.  Besides my selfish desire to play this and have partners to play with, my brother has lived in Germany and visited most of the cities in the NW quadrant of the board.  He loved it!  The board is fun and the most connections bonus is great, and the passengers add a lot of fun planning too.  

I have played all versions of Ticket to Ride and this is easily my favorite.  I love juggling the different modes of scoring, how the addition of passengers seriously enables different strategies (e.g. short links worth fewer points connected through high point passenger cities vs. routes using high point value links with fewer passenger chips available), the 2 draw piles of missions that enhance the ability to attempt different strategies, and the variety of card types and link lengths in the game.  

I think this scores lower than the US and Europe versions because those who strictly prefer heavier games still don't like this version of Ticket to Ride and rate it accordingly. Then many light gamers who love the original Ticket to Ride try this version and find that the additional choices are too confusing or distract from the simple, enjoyable game play they prefer and rate it low too.  

I think you need to try this unless you just hate the whole TTR concept.  There are a lot of strategies to try, competitive/blocking type play is very possible, and the meta-game of what strategies people in your group prefer will give you different experiences in different groups.  It's great!

The version which weights the game away from family and towards gamers by adding intra-game bonus points for running passengers around the board as well as claiming routes, forcing people to play to the board faster rather than holding off for optimal routes.

As others have said tension is prevalent here - apparently in 2player games I play really frantically?

With the advent of so many new maps (Asia, India, etc.) I find myself lacking the desire to play this anymore.

I prefer it to the others, with the exception of the original of course. Carry commuters around, but make sure to time the use properly. And there are end points, so the bonus no longer goes to the longest train but to most completed tickets, making taking more tickets more worth while.

This version of Ticket to Ride introduces "passengers" who can claim the top chip in a pile of decreasing-value chips in cities you've connected.  Connecting more cities is thus better, but you have to be careful that, in spending time to connect more cities and run passengers, you still have enough turns to fulfill your ticket plans.  Overall, I prefer the simplicity of the original, and I'm not quite sure the tickets are balanced to my liking, but it's still enjoyable.

Also the train cards are the best of all the TTR games IMO as they are all unique with images of the Marklin model train companies models.

Another hit from the Ticket to Ride empire.  Differs from the other versions in that instead of getting a bonus for the longest route, in Marklin you can move a passenger piece 3 times during the game along your route, and the longer your route, and if you get to those cities ahead of the other players, the more points you get.  The only downside to the game is that although it has very attractive train cards, I find it hard to tell some of the cards apart.

The best of the Ticket to Ride incarnations so far. Keeps the tension of the original by skipping the station from TTR:Europe.

Better than the original and perhaps better than Europe.  More decisions to be had with the Passenger element, and more stress placed on the tickets, making a balanced strategy (points from routs and tickets) more usable.  Still, there is some luck on the destination card draws, and that can still tip the game.  The train cards are awesome looking.  The card hoarding strategy, compromised a bit by the competition for track in TtR: Europe, is further mitigated by the Passenger points.

After first play. Setup was an issue with the disks. Rules were unclear about where passengers could be placed (I have since found the corrections here, but that didn't help while we were playing).

It is actually quite wonderful. Totally replaces T2R US.

For me this is better than Europe, but because of the extra layer of maths/vp route with the passengers exacerbates the summing up problem I have in the original in that all the tension in the play itself evaporates in the summing up.

Best of the three TtR editions that I have played. I have rated the original 7.5 and TtR: Europe 6.5.  Märklin's  placing and running passengers adds a new dimention to the game and makes it more interesting and increases the strategy and the heft.

After only one play (5 players), I wasn't terribly impressed. The set up is tedious due to having to stack all those tokens on the cities. There was a mad rush to accumulate tokens early,  but once the high-paying tokens were taken, everyone lost interest in the passengers. It didn't seem worth the risk to waste a turn for the sake of a few 1 or 2 point tokens. I actually couldn't wait for the game to end. I'll stick with the orginal.

But in my playing of this game, I had the sinking feeling that I could easily be locked out of my routes through no fault of my own.  Just too much competition for the central core connections.  As to the passengers, I'm not sure they add a lot, but it's a cute addition.

The marklin drawings are really fun (mostly for my train collecting friends). Some people have trouble with German geography, and there are some interesting ways to favor certain portions of the map. The passenger mechanic is hit or miss... mostly miss I think. But it's nice to shake things up once in a while.

If you need one T2R get this one. The passenger mechanics adds some depth to classic T2R. Still prefer Railways of the World (or other games from Steam family) but the basic mechanics of T2R is so easy to grasp that it might be better to use with first time players...

My second favorite in the series. The passengers add a new mechanic to the game, and I haven't seen a game played that the winner didn't utilize them. If you get off to a bad start with them, there is no way for you to win. It is also easy to play with the basic rules and not use the passengers, so it can be a good change form the USA board (I have not tried any of the user created maps). It also seems like there is slightly less contention for areas.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
The other TTR -- Europe or U.S. -- is better.  The additions of 'passengers' and decreasing-value tokens to collect adds pointless complexity for very little reward in actual game play (and I'm not averse to complexity as you can see from my other game ratings, but this stuff is just wasted effort).  If you have to play this, I recommend playing this one first, then moving on to the better versions and not looking back.

Terza versione di un classico dei giochi da tavolo di Alan R. Moon e... terzo centro! Sicuramente il migliore, perché poco più impegnativo dei predecessori. Grazie alla versatilità degli obiettivi, soprattutto per quanto riguarda l'aggiunta della variante strategica dei passeggeri. Comunque rimane sempre un ottimo gioco per tutti, adattissimo da utilizzare per far avvicinare ai giochi da tavolo "moderni" chi è rimasto legato al passato con i vari Monopoli e Risiko, ma allo stesso tempo capace di conquistare anche giocatori più esperti.  Le regole si imparano in pochissimo tempo e si può immediatamente giocare con soddisfazione e divertimento. Richiede una certa strategia e la fortuna (si tratta pur sempre di pescare delle carte) non incide troppo visto i vari fattori da considerare per arrivare alla vittoria (locomotive speciali da +4, un alto numero di obiettivi e passeggeri) sono tutt'altro che banali e fanno la differenza in quanto le partite sono sempre combattutissime fino alla fine. L'edizione Marklin è una chicca per collezionisti... di trenini! Ormai la Days of Wonder ci ha abituato bene per quanto riguarda la componentistica, grazie alle bellissime carte con i disegni di tutte le locomotive d'epoca. Purtroppo la mappa della Germania, può essere una difficoltà maggiore, per chi non conosce bene la geografia delle città tedesche. Infine la scalabilità, il gioco è da quattro a cinque giocatori, inutile giocarci in due o in tre. Un Ticket to Ride tutti dovrebbero averlo nella loro ludoteca.

Another map variant in the Ticket To Ride series, but offers what is perhaps the best balance between strategy and luck. There are no tunnels or ferries, but passengers this time around where passengers traveling along a train route can pick up point tokens in various cities. Map is very asymmetrical allowing for different approaches to all be successful depending on what your plan is. Art is great and the cards each depict a different train model which is a neat concept. Still a good amount of luck is present in the game but there's enough on your end that you can do to give yourself a good chance to do well.

I tried a 3 player game of this, and it was brutal game filled with hate and evil looks.  It was much crueler than I thought it was going to be.  So in the future I will probably only play with 2 or 4 players, unless I want to play a mean game.

It is much more strategic than the original one.

RATING: 7
My wifes favorite game, and our first railroad game; remarkably we all really, really enjoy it!  There are passengers (3 ea) that may ride the rails and pass over various markets.  They are a key to getting a competitive score.

For me, there is still something thats missing which has caused me to look into some other train games.  Of those that seem to be giving me the most interest tend to be more like economic games with a railroad theme pasted on and don't seem to be offering what it is that I think I may be missing. 

Considering Silverton - if you have any comments concerning this I would love to hear them in a PM or somesuch manner.  Well I got no feed back, but purchased Silverton.  Marklin Edition Ticket to Ride is completly different.

This one has gained a lot of table time on our weekend family game night, particularly if we have four or five players.  I think our group generally prefers Nordic Countries or the close second, Switzerland over Marklin edition.  However so much game play we often choose to to reverse the 'market' values so the bigger numbers come out closer to the end of the game.  We also randomly choose a train to decide first player as opposed to the youngest.

This was the first version of TtR that won me over (also, it helped that I had recently become enamourated of Thurn und Taxis, which is a wholy different game but with which TtR Marklin shares some similarities). I would never guess that the simpler original version of TtR would then become my favorite TtR after I gave it another shot; the passenger mechanics make Marklin a more complex game, sure, but they don't add all that much fun in return for making the game more difficult to manage and harder to absorb.

I still like this game, but it’s my least favorite in the TTR series (well, unless you count the card game, which I don’t). I don’t think it’s an accident that this game is rated lower than TTR and TTR: Europe. I guess my main issue is that it’s not light enough to be a gateway game, but the extra strategic options don’t do enough for me. Prefer Thurn and Taxis to this.

Ticket to Ride: Marklin is a fantastic progression of the series. The map is tight and brutal with the 3-player rules.

Retains the tension of the original ticket to ride, the sense of "NONONONO PLEAASE DON'T PLAY THERE NOW".  But has the added benefit of cleaning up some of the luck of the ticket draws.  The inclusion of passengers is really something--with this one simple addition, the game requires more thinking of connectivity, timing, route placement, greediness for points.  Does not supplant the need for the original ticket to ride--the Maerklin edition seems like it would be overwhelming for non-gamers, despite the fact that the rules remain nearly as simple as the original version.  An excellent gamer's game, if you can stand a healthy dose of player-induced chaos.

Wow! A joy to play. It's wonderfully easy to teach and get going. If it seems confusing, just don't use the passenger mechanic.

My favorite TTR (I've also played US, Europe, Asia, India, and Switzerland).  I love the passengers in Märklín, and the fact that there are 5 opportunities to claim a route with 7 spaces to get 18 points.  Also, the 2 different stacks of destination tickets is great.  The fact that there are no tunnels or ferries on this board allows you to focus on strategizing your passenger moves for maximum points.  This TTR variation is so fun and thinky.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Better than Europe, but still on the bottom of TtR versions for me.  I really like that you can choose between the big and small destination decks - this innovation should be added to all of the other versions.  I don't like how the 5 face-up cards can get clogged with 2 rainbow and 2 passenger cards. The passenger scoring mechanic is interesting but doesn't add much strategy to the game - you're not really going to change what routes you take because of passenger points; a similar mechanic is much better implemented in Thurn & Taxis, where it is the heart of the game.  I really don't like the 4+ rainbow cards - there's rarely a time you wouldn't want to pick up one face-up, so it adds a larger chance component to game, if you just get lucky with one being revealed just before your turn; you can easily remedy this by removing them, although it might make completing the long routes in East Germany that much harder.

--May2006-- Nice (if slightly fiddly) TtR variant.  The passenger mechanic adds quite a lot to the strategic variables present - and the map is nicely asymmetric in a bunch of ways.

I think that with a collection of gamers sophisticated enough to appreciate the dynamics of Märklin, we might well play something else.

Adding a bit more clutter to the pure and appealing game mechanics of the original doesn't ruin the game, and adds some strategy components.

The best version yet - but please no more TtR games - that's enough now. The additions are good but take away from the simplicity of the original. The choice as to which one to play would depend on the people you are playing with. Those counters for the passengers to pick up are a bit fiddly - they should have been stacking plastic pieces. The fiddly counter annoyance is balanced out by the purple train cars! :D Yeah!

RATING: 8.5
A new take on TtR with the inclusion of the passengers as well as the 4+ locomotives. The passenger mechanic is very cool, as you have to now think about when you want to place them down (you only get three), and need to be quick enough to use them before the points deplete. It adds another layer of strategy to the game. I love it, and think everybody should own some iteration of TtR.

Pretty much like the original in strategy, with the added passengers element. I feel that this version is better than the original, and would rather play this anyday. Although not with three players. It seems we all had tickets on the left side of the board, and all the double/triple routes being reduced to singles really put a cutthroatish feeling on the board. The win ended up being pushed forward by long tracks, rather than the passengers. The artwork is also much better in this game than the orginal. I've never played the Europe edition, but I'd say this one really makes the original pretty obsolete.

I can see why it's a good family game, but from a gamer's perspective the decisions are fairly limited: if you've got the cards you need, lay track / run passengers, if not, draw cards. If you're going to get a TtR game, get this one, and your head examined.

The edition we eventually bought, to satisfy my wife's love of the game and balance my own slight indifference. I like the fact that this edition comes with standard sized cards, the choice between long and short tickets, and the little passenger figures are cool : passenger mechanic adds variety to the game, is fairer to new players than stations, and of course can just be left out if you want to play the vanilla game and reward the longest track instead. Main disadvantage, when playing with passengers, is setting up time (extra 5-10 minutes) and general fiddliness of the goods markers.

Boy this really steps it up a notch! You're looking for the best timing for you passengers to move, but there's also the pressure to take the most tickets and lay the track. Short stretches of track are now less of a pain than the original game because they're a goldmine for passenger points... provided you can get to them first.
The map is very tight.
The cards are just beautiful. Every wagon card is a unique train model. That's a nice touch. I can't fathom the problem some people seem to be having with the points chits. Two people set the chits up in 30 seconds - yes, I timed it. If you can get another player to shuffle the cards and another to hand out the wagon, you should be ready to go in less than two minutes. We also had no problem picking up the points chits with our fingers. There's no Clippers problem here.
Great game and worth owning even if you own the original.

RATING: 9
This game actually improves upon the original TtR, if that's actually possible.  It adds passengers to the mix, which is a 4th possible action that a player must wrestle with each turn.  The right lines, even if they are not your own, with the right placement of passengers, can be another route to victory.  In addition, the destination tickets are seperated into long and short routes, which give players more choice as to "many short" or "few long" destintation tickets to win.

Picture regular Ticket to Ride. Now change it to a German map. Add a new kind of wild card that lets you complete routes of 4 or more cars only and remove the draw-one restriction for that card. Add bonus tokens to each city. Give everyone three passenger pieces, and let them place a passenger after completing a route to either city of that route. Add an extra action, where you can move a passenger along your routes, collecting bonus tokens as you go, removing the passenger from the game at the end. Add passenger cards to the deck that allow you to borrow one opponent's route for the purposes of moving your passenger. Score points equal to the number on the bonus token. Aaaaaaand that's about it.

Disappointing entry in the series.  The Passengers don't do enough, and actively get in the way of card draws.  I prefer On The Underground's version of a similar mechanism.

RATING: 5
I think it takes the fun out of Ticket to Ride and that's not easy.  The passengers and merchandise tokens make the game very fiddly. I did like the long/short mechanic on tickets but the passengers really left me cold and added a lot of clutter to the board without much additional strategy.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Now there are two main, conflicting goals in the game: get tickets and connect routes all over the place, or go for passengers and get one long route going. I like that. Adds a little complexity (and strategic depth) through the passengers, but compensates for it by removing the annoying tunnel and ferry rules. Easier to complete long routes thanks to the +4 locomotives. Takes the best parts of other Ticket to Ride games and combines them into a solid package (country tickets from Switzerland, no ferries & tunnels from USA, Globetrotter bonus from Nordic Countries, combination of short and long tickets from Europe etc), with the passenger rule. The most flexible TtR for player scaling, because of a well-designed map.

Wish they could release expansion maps instead of having so many stand-alone games. I'm inclined toward Nordic for 2er, Switzerland for 3er, Marklin for 4-5.

Switzerland: 3+2
Nordic: 3+2
Marklin: 3+2
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Feels like more strategic depth than the original game, yet plays faster! Seems like a superior game. However, I wouldn't go around introducing it to non-gamers left and right like you can do with the original.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like TTR:Marklin well enough.  It is a TTR game after all.  Unfortunately, it doesn't really grab me.  I guess the best I could say is that it is too gamey.  I like all of the changes and additions that are present -- nothing stands out as being bad or unpleasant.  Still, the game seems to want to be a little less gamey than this one is.  

If you look at my games played, you will see that this one was played several times fairly quickly, then disappeared from the rotation.  If I had bothered to rate it back then, it would probably have received an 8.  Even then, though, the original was my preferred game.  And that seems to have been the biggest problem for this edition.  Not that it isn't a fine game, but that the original (to me) is so much more fun.

Still, I think it is a shame that it has not been played more.  And Nordic will make it more likely to not get played.  Still, it is nice enough and I really love the model train art on the cards, being a model railroader in my yout. [05/07/2009]

All the merchandise tokens are fiddly both in setup and in collection (though this is clearly getting better through experience).

RATING: 8
Probably the heaviest of the T2R franchise. The extra rules (moving of passengers, smaller tighter map, +10 points for most completed routes) and the nice touches (All the train cards are different) make it worth picking up even if you have one or two of the other games in the series.

Games are often tense. Routes can be blocked off early and there are interesting decisions: do you move your passengers now or later? Do you quickly complete your routes so they won't be blocked off? 

Minuses: Probably a little fiddly with the extra scoring tokens and the stacking plastic VP nipple markers are a pain to use.

Régen sokat olvastam erről a TTR-ról, most sikerült kipróbálnom. Megérte, mert ez a leggémeresebb változat, ebben van a legtöbb változatosság és talán ebben nincs nyerő stratégia. Nincsenek állomások, mint az Európában, cserében vannak az utasok. Őket egy-egy megépített szakaszunk végére rakhatjuk le, majd egy külön akcióval a saját vonalunkon szállíthatjuk, miközben az egyes állomásokon a játék elején lehelyezett csökkenő sorrendben levő pontokat vehetnek fel. Használhatjuk más játékos vonalait is, ha szerzünk a vonatkártyák közé kevert utaskártyákból. Egy jó úttal 10-20, akár még több pontot is tudunk szerezni, ami elég jelentős ahhoz, hogy ne érje meg ezt a lehetőséget kihagyni. Minden játékosnak 3-3 utasa van, ezek egyet-egyet utazhatnak a játék során. Jó dolog még, hogy a térképen a leghosszabb utak színesek, ezért muszáj olyan kártyákat gyűjteni hozzájuk, nem lehet bármilyen színből megépíteni őket. Cserében bevezették a +4-es mozdonyokat, amelyekből akár kettő is elvehető a kártyahúzás akció választásakor és 4 vagy annál hosszabb szakaszokhoz használható fel. Summa summárum a Marklin TTR a gémerebb játékosoknak készült, illetve azoknak, akik túl egysíkúan játszanak már az alappal vagy az Európával. Tetszett.

Need some more time to consider whether I like what passengers (a new dimension and strategy to "go for") add is ultimately worth it to me.

However, the map itself is quite good. Worked great for 2 players and I could see it being fine with more.

Gets the conservative TTR rating for me for now until I understand it better, but I could see this going to an 8 (as most of the other TTR games have)

The passenger mechanic adds a great new twist to the game--it's possible to rack up a huge score with some carefully-timed passenger moves.

Rating based on one play. Ticket to Ride Marklin is an excellent enhancement to Ticket to Ride. I greatly prefer the passenger concept to the stations, tunnels, and ferries that were added in Ticket to Ride: Europe. The passengers add a new level of strategy and drastically open up other options for optimal plays.

RATING: 9
I view Marklin as the ugly stepchild of the Ticket series, and I don't know why.  I think I just place it so far away from the rest of the series due to the passenger mechanic.  But guess what?  I still love it, and it provides a different experience that I enjoy very much!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
The added passengers make this game a little bit more complex, as they are the ones that determine who will win and lose the game. While, this change in mechanics has a nice touch to it, along with being able to decide what kind of tickets one wants, I still prefer the Europe edition of all of the TTR games.

This version: adds merchandise tokens (VP; larger cities have more pts), passengers (single-use -- pick up merchandise), passenger cards (use to travel others' routes), and limited-wild train cards (only 4+ routes); changes destination tickets (half are 5-11pts, half are 12-22pts); and final 10pt bonus is for most tickets completed instead of longest train.

After several plays: an interesting addition to the basic game, but the tokens are a bit too fiddly for me and I don't like such a strong emphasis on tickets. Of course, I'm not sure if that emphasis is just because I played with good players, or if it's unique to this version of the game.

Another great addition to the TtR line.  This game turned a few of my regular strategies on the side.  I no longer can sit back and collect a huge hand of cards then play them optimally since I need to claim routes and run passengers as soon as I can so I can score more points.  The tickets are now in groups of long and short so that brings more choices.

The best TTR for gamers and those up for a little more strategy that the base game offers.  This one has a good luck-to-planning ratio found by adding the passengers.  Personally there are other games I'd rather use ofr gateway games simply because TTR doesn't promote a lot of either interaction or simple table talk, as everyone tends to get too wrapped up in their own planning...or they don't and they're the players everyone has to remind to make their play.

This is the version of "Ticket to Ride" that finally captured my interest enough that I could think about replaying it without worrying about becoming quickly bored.  It returns to the simplicity of the original edition, while adding the new layer of the passengers.  These little train riders add another form of tension and competition that elevates it slightly above just being a card-collecting and train-laying game.  All that being said though, I much prefer that gorgeous-looking "Railroad Tycoon" (the game, that is, not the tycoon himself) for my train game fix.

[DoW 2007 edition] {Trains; drafting; connection, set collection; optimal 5p}  T2R:M is an nice take on the Ticket to Ride system.  This one is very competitive and has the best player interaction: players race to get passengers, route and tickets. The distribution of the tickets gets players struggle for routes: players can no longer hoard cards and claim route late. The other factor makes route competition strong is that players can get passenger tokens along the route (which is quite substantial in victory points).  And, the separation of long and short destination tickets provides tactical options for players.  I prefer putting back destination card in this game to discarding in T2R:E.   In all, this is a more gamey version of the Ticket to Ride.  I enjoy it.

I love the game components: big board, excellently illustrated cards, cute passenger tokens, etc.  Thumb up for DOW.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Ticket to Ride is a light game. That's part of it's appeal. When you add extra "gamer" elements, it bumps up on the complexity scale where there are a ton of better choices.

Marklin is better than Europe, but the designers should keep this series simple where T2R is the current "best in class".

I might have rated this higher if it were the first in the series but does the world really need three different versions of Ticket to Ride?  Still, this is a very good game, perhaps the best in the series although I'm not completely convinced of that. The passenger delivery mechanic significantly alters the strategy, making it much less attractive to hoard cards and delay route building (which is the typical TTR strategy).  The lack of the stations found in TTR:Europe, means that this is more cutthroat, it's very common to get cut off, particularly in the southwest portion of the map.

This is a game I like to play with my family. Even my 7 year olds can play though they struggle to keep their destinations secret. i like the passengers as these can be fun to go on long journeys right the way around the board if you have collected enough passenger cards. Sometimes I concentrate more on this than completing destinations. This version is a bit fiddly to set up but nothing to put you off and once you have got your eye in the slightly confusing graphics become easier to identify quickly. I wish the trains could have little pegs like some scrabble pieces used to, to hold them in place; there is always someone who nudges the board at some point in the game!

RATING: 9
Similar to regular ticket to ride, but instead of a bonus for the longest route, there is a bonus for the most completed tickets. Also adds travelers who players send around the board to collect victory points throughout the game. Travel earlier and you will have fewer segments to travel, but higher victory point tokens to collect. Waiting too long to travel can result in missing out on valuable victory point tokens.

New but has gotten tons of play. Love the passenger mechanic, adds another layer of strategy without over complicating the game. The board is tight and competitive with any number of players ... GF and her daughter love the game, but if you play at our house, be warned: we block and you had better use your passengers to maximum effect or you’ll be left in the dust.

A great TTR variation which makes it a bit gamier.  I love the passenger mechanism as it really introduces a nice scoring alternative without changing the game too much.  I thought the tickets felt balance and the board was tight.

I'd definitely play this over the original if I had a choice.

Played once. Very Neat.  I like the splitting of long and short routes.  I like the passengers because they subtly pull the game in a new direction that needs to be considered.  I also like the distribution of routes on the map. The distribution makes for some outlandish workarounds in the NW and in the ESE.  It's absolutely crazy what one little one piece route lost can do to your plans.  2006/08/17

What can you say?  It's another of the excellent Ticket to Ride games.  One of the things that is most interesting in it is the only slight downside to the game: this version is a cross-marketed game featuring trains from the German Marklin line of toy trains, and each card has a unique train drawing.  It makes realizing which cards you actually have take a moment or two longer sometimes, but at the same time, it's pretty cool to see all the different trains.  The passengers add another interesting mechanism to the game to make it a clever variant.

This is less of a gateway game, and more of a gamer's game, than is Ticket to Ride, due to the passengers.

I think my rating of this game suffers because of my preset notions about what I like about Ticket to Ride.  I want it to be a zippy, quick fun game.  The Marklin edition is a bit fiddly with all the little passenger scoring markers, and it just feels like a little too much work for a Ticket to Ride game.  In general, I don't think it's really that fiddly, or that fiddlyness is that bad, it's the comparison to the original that harms this rating a little.

Simply beautiful design and artwork. Very fast paced and fun. With 4p the game feels like you don't have much time to do anything besides lay routes for your initial destination cards with very little room for much else. The winner is often the person who gets lucky draws for destination cards at the end that use routes they have already developed. Sometimes a bit too much draw luck plays a role as well. It's better than the original, but still has some flaws. I'd like to play a 3p game and see what happens - my rating may change.

The best of the Ttr's so far? Maybe, but definitely the "gamiest" one. If you want to play god and transform innocent Non-Gamers into drooling geeks subsequently, introduce them to basic TtR first, then play TtR Europe with them and then go for TtR Märklin. The idea of the passengers introduces another element of competition, and the map is even less spacy then its two predecessors, resulting in that feeling of intense panic whether someone claims a route before you or not. Slight criticism: If you happen to start off the game by picking and completing the route "Rostock->Konstanz" you can pick up destination cards without unease, for there are many route cards along that way. On the opposite there are too few eastern connections.

I am updating this game to an 8, after playing a 5-player game with my siblings, one of which has not a gaming bone in her body.  She ate it up, hook line and sinker, and I realized that this game is an absolute gem.  It appeals to such a broad audience, and is one game that I suggest that won't draw a "Honey, maybe they are Pictionary people" look from my wife.  And we haven't even played with the passengers--yet.  Great game, a favorite theme, and deceiving depth.

I really enjoyed a couple of the new mechanics, particularly the passengers and ending a route in a country, rather than a city.

The passenger mechanic made players balance building a giant connected route with waiting too long and having all the high value chits gobbled up by opponents.

Being able to end a route in a whole country, rather than one city, was a neat way to give players some options when opponents claimed key routes from them.

On the negative, the passenger cards seemed too abundant. My hand was clogged with them at the end of the game.

Another great addition to the TTR line.  This one has a bit more of an aggressive take as you want to get to the passangers first and you can steal them from other people totally. Not exactly what the other TTR's have brought to the table so far but was a lot of fun...if using TTR as a gateway game though might want to stick with standard or Europe.

I definitely thought this was better than Ticket to Ride Europe because the rules changes were much more interesting than the tunnels, ferries, and stations.  I still think the original might be best because it's best as a gateway game, and Marklin doesn't quite add enough to really be a gamer's game, but is probably too complex to be a gateway game, so it ends up in a middle no-man's land (sort of like Thurn & Taxis, which is not straightforward enough to be a good gateway game, but not deep enough to be a good gamer's game).

RATING: 8
A nice change of pace from the regular Ticket to Ride. Here you have a few new things:

a) Travelers: you can put them on a track you just laid and then, afterwards, you can use your turn to move him - the Traveler will collect all the point tokens in his way, then is out of the game. Everyone has 3 Travelers, and when used properly, they can get you a LOT of points;

b) +4 Locomotives: you can only use them in tracks that require 4 or more trains;

c) Travelers cards: you must use one of them for each track of other players your Traveler used in his way;

d) Point tokens: there are 3 types - the white, that has only one in some cities that are worth 2 points each. The yellow, that are worth 1 to 3 points, and are put in stacks (of 3, 2 and 1 being in the bottom); the first Traveler that passes through the city, get the 3 points token, the secondo Traveler, the 2 points tokens, and so forth. The red, that are worth 4, 3 and 2, that works like the yellow ones. The black: worth 7, 6, 5 and 4 that goes in a stack, from higher to lower, in Berlin; like the yellow and red, the first Traveler that passes or ends his movement there, takes to top point token; the second takes the second, and so on.

These changes make the game gain a new layer of strategy that I liked, since it makes the game remain on the light side, but adds more decisions to be made.

The map in itself is rather boring: no tunnels, nor special tracks that require locomotives to be built. A new map, with these features, would be welcome! Even with this, Ticket to Ride: Marklin is, now, probably my favorite one of the series.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The addition of the passenger mechanic in Ticket to Ride: Märklin adds a layer of strategy over the original game, and the board seems well-balanced between the short routes on the western half of the map and the longer routes on the eastern half. Also, dividing the destination ticket cards into two decks -- one for the shorter connections and one for the longer ones -- reduces the randomness a bit compared to the original game.

My goto gateway game, because I always really enjoy it too.  I like the extra decisions in the Marklin edition (passengers, long and short routes).  Plays well with every number except two, which may have been a fluke (I was teaching the game).  The three player game can be particularly brutal because it's so much easier to block.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Seems to take longer than the listed time if people don't know what they're doing, or if you have a high number of players, but this is an awesome game. There are lots of decisions to make, beautiful components, and lots of ways to score points. As good as any game I've ever played. For those who don't like spatial games, this may not be for you. There is also potential for messing with other players, so watch out if you don't like that kind of game.

Things that kept me from giving it a 10: not everyone likes the complexity level. Also, the game feels a bit long, especially with 4-5 players. These factors keep us from pulling this game out as often as others.

I really like what the Passenger mechanism brings to the table, rewarding long routes (without the usual "longest route" card) and presenting another pressing choice for how to use your turn.

Excellent game! Our gateway game, but I think normal Ticket to Ride (or TTR: Marklin without passengers) is a better bet for getting others into the hobby. The plus side is that the first time or two, you can play this one without passengers, and it's essentially the same. I suspect some of the balance of location has to do with their passenger values, but it's fun regardless.

I have played one 5 player game of TTR:M.

I think this game does stand apart from the original ticket to ride a little better than Europe did, but I can't say I have a strong preference for it over the others.  That's doesn't mean I don't like it, but I suspect the choice over which Ticket to Ride to play will probably depend on other people's preferences rather than mine.

I like the passengers, but I think I will play them differently next time.  I had one really big passenger run, and then two smaller ones.  I think I might have actually done better if I had started using them earlier in the game.  My first run would have been smaller, but the other runs might have improved.  On the other hand, starting earlier might have convinced the other players to start earlier, too, so who knows.

I think Days of Wonder made the right financial decision when they decided to release each version of TTR as a stand-alone game, but it would be really cool if these were expansions that you could mix and match.  The passengers would be interesting on the Europe board, although I'm not sure the game balance would still work.

The long and short ticket decks are also a nice touch, but I'm not convinced one should ever draw from the short deck for your initial tickets, and then whoever gets ticket synergy is highly likely to win big.

My third favorite in the series. I enjoy the introduction of the passengers, but most of the people we play with don't. They feel that one good "ride" can make the game to unbalanced and put that person to far in the lead.

Probably not a fair rating given that I've only played this 2p. Very little tension at 2p. Can see that more players would be a lot more interesting, but I just don't care enough to wait for that to happen. If I want more depth I'd just rather play something else.

RATING: 7
I think the colorful board, beautiful cards and physical train pieces are the best part of this game. The play itself is alright, but definitely a filler before pulling out the big game of the night. This seems a lot like playing the card game rummy with set collection, sandbagging, and the mild player interaction of wrecking your opponents sets. Still, not bad, especially with larger groups. 

I've had a change of heart on this series and have come to really enjoy the tension of the game. Märklin is still my favorite board to play on, even after trying the others.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
Ticket To Ride on the German map adding rules for passengers. Unlike the TtR Europe version, which adds further random elements (tunnels) and which is to me the weakest I've tried, the Marklin edition's passenger rules add a "gamey" element - makes for a game with several layers of options where points can be obtained (tickets, routes, passengers). The map itself is more balanced than the Europe map - though not as many long connections as USA it does not have choke points of Europe (and so no need for Stations and keeps the strategic element of blocking routes of USA). I also like that Marklin usually doesn't incorporate a ticket grab like the Switzerland tends to (though that may be a strategy, if desired). I can't see why an expansion adding passengers to the USA version cannot eventually follow, to add more options for that map as well.

Purchased used but like new.

This is the collector's edition so a must have for anyone wanting to collect the whole series.  (Which we eventually hope to do.)  However, the setup of the passengers takes some time and feels kind of fiddly.  We also felt like we had a lot more "take-that" on this map than in others, where we were constantly stealing routes from each other.  With no stations, that can become a serious problem.  (And a welcome challenge.)  I'm really looking forward to getting Germany because I think it will improve the passengers mechanic while still using the competitive map.  If you already have, or plan to get, Germany, this is probably not necessary for anything other than collection purposes.

Ticket to Ride is to me, the perfect gateway game. There is skill and strategy in play, but plenty of luck and chaos, too, so anyone has a chance to win. Turns are very fast, and you can always do something on your turn, so you're never bored. There's a slow build up of tension too as people start to crowd the routes you want, threatening to take it from you!

Not too much different from [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9209]the base game[/url] to raise it head and shoulders above it, but it sticks to the basic formula that resonates with some folks.  For me, the addition of the passengers and the consequent boosting of shorter routes is enough to make it better than the original.  It does have the drawback of a little bit more stuff to learn than the original.  I've never had much success with this franchise as gateway games, so I don't mind the added complexity, but you've been warned if you're looking for a way to hook somebody.

TtR: Marklin is the first Ticket to Ride game I've played other than the base USA game.  I find the bigger cards to be a HUGE improvement over the absurdly tiny ones in base TtR.  Marklin's Germany map is fun in 2-players, and doesn't feel as expansive or out-of-control as the US map can.  I like that there are slightly longer routes, as well.  I haven't played Europe so I can't speak to the difference there, but Marklin provides a significantly deeper experience than standard TtR with the inclusion of passengers and the new types of locomotives.  I also like that the bonus is for most tickets, not longest route, as the Passenger already gives you an incentive to create a long line with no branches.  I Like regular Ticket to Ride, Marklin only improves on the experience.  Combine that with my love of model trains, and you get one happy gamer!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I might be biased toward the first TTR I ever played, but I think Marklin is far and away the best map in the series. To be fair, we don't play with the passenger rules, but if they're ignored, this map gives the most options and best rewards repeated play long after the other maps have gone stale and remains accessible to new players.

The "gamers" version of TtR.  Passengers add a nice twist and prevent some of the card hoarding of the original.  Also enjoy the choice of long/short tickets.  A little disppointed with the bland map and I'm not too familiar with all of the German cities so finding them on the map can be a little tough initially, but I'll get there.  Sweet spot might be more than 3 players.

Commented after two plays (first one almost ten years ago). The passenger element gives a nice variation, but increases the setup time.

What I like about the Ticket to Ride games is that they're quick, light, and fun.  The changes to the system in the Marklin edition make it more fiddly, and it takes a bit longer (if only for having to pick up all the chips).  It takes something away from the game, for me.

RATING: 9
This fixes most of my problems with the original and has none of the ones they introduced with the other maps (the LAST thing TTR needed was more randomness, in my opinion). Passengers finally provide a reasonable reward for short routes, splitting the destinations is a welcome change, and it really feels like there are multiple viable paths to victory.

There's a chance this might fall to an 8 or so with more plays. I don't like the increased setup time or the art on the cards (makes it too hard to tell what you've got at a glance). In the 2 games I've played, we've also had somewhat of a problem with stagnation in the face-up cards (something I've only experienced with 2 player games with TTR US), which I'm hoping is either poor shuffle or not really grasping the passenger card strategy yet.

Still, this is my favorite in the series by a decent margin. I hope I get to play it enough that I'll start to learn German geography :)

EDIT:  For now I'll keep my original text (following this sentence), but since I wrote my comment I've played Marklin another time, and have played other TtR versions quite a bit -- my rating and enthusiasm stands.

I've only played this once, and normally I only rate games after I've played at least a few times.  Therefore, I might modify my rating after I have a few more games under my belt.

But I really liked it.  I haven't played the other TtR games yet, but I really enjoyed the different ways of making points, opening up different strategies, including adding in the passengers for more points.

It was a very fun game and I can't wait to play it again.

The third installment in Ticket to Ride series. The map is of Germany and this game introduces Passengers and Merchandise to the  game.

It's a clever map, since you have shorter routes on the westen side of the map and longer routes on the eastern side. Beside, you choose long or short destination routes. The passenger allows more strategic moves. I think there are too much choices for a family game, but you may remove the passengers. It's certaily a further step to a more strategic game than the original, timming is very imortant in this game.My major concern are those anoying tokens setup. I'll keep 7 in respect of the game family.

This game is pretty fun.  It seems complex, but is easy to pick up after a couple of rounds.  The biggest problem I have with it is all the pieces.  It  takes a little bit to set up, and to put away.  That problem is easily solved by playing more than one game.  Unfortunately I have yet to meet anybody who will play more than one game in a row.  About 45 minutes worth of play time. I like the fact that there are many different ways to score points, so that there is something for almost every style of play.

RATING: 5
At first I thought the inclusion of another way to score in Ticket to Ride would be a great addition to the game.  However, I was quickly proved wrong.  The biggest problem lay in the fact that this slows down the gameplay considerably, especially for those prone to take a long time to decide their action.  With the new passenger rule, there are even more points at stake when considering where to build your tracks, so as you can imagine, those that are already indecisive will now be slower than before.  Not to mention those bits are a nightmare to setup and to pick up, creating unnecessary down time throughout the game.  Last but not least is the fact that one can just build a medium length route and accumulate points by simply shuttling passengers, defeating the original intention of the game, which is to connect destinations and contest in track building.

As it stands, for me Marklin is the worst out of the whole series, and one I'd rather not play again soon.

The passengers add some insidious, point-"stealing" strategies to the Ticket to Ride formula.  If you wait too long building up your passenger's path, he may pick up much less than you thought, as your opponent rides your lines using passenger cards.  On the other hand, collect passenger cards for too long, and you may get cut off from completing your Destination Cards' routes, taking serious negative points at the end.  If you're just going to keep improving this game, Alan, keep up the good work!

Passengers might be one twist too many...or it might just require more attention.

This is definitely an improvement over the original. I like the passenger mechanic as it adds another level of strategy to the mix. I'm still not thrilled with the theme, but the gameplay is solid for what it is.

I love this game.  The passenger is a great mechanism.  Good for anyone:  family, gamers, prostitutes, etc.

Even better than the original. Much more balanced and much deeper.

After 1 Play: This is the gamers version of the Ticket to Ride series for 4-5 players (with 2-3, play Nordic Countries).  Unlike Europe, which removed tension, the passengers add a fun new layer to the experience.  It becomes a little game of chicken to see when a player will break down and first move a passenger.

I love the two previous installments, and this one adds another flavour. Even though it's the same basic game, the game is played quite different. It is still easy to introduce to new players, but I whould prefer the Europe version to new gamers. This version is a little more fiddly with the small goods-parts scattered over the board. This installment is more intense than the previous ones, and unlike the Europe version, you don't get that second chance to complete a ticket using a station. Overall, this game is one of the two best introduction games I have ever played; the other one is Ticket to Ride: Europe.

Semi-cooperative card game. Playing with at least 3 is a necessity. The person who draws the best hand will have a big advantage in any given round, but that didn't stop me from having a good time trouncing the cardinal's men together with my fellow musketeers.

Semi-cooperative game of simultaneous selection and bluffing.  Players work together playing Musketeer cards, and the combined total must beat the value of a Guard card.  If you win as a team, highest player gets a Gem, if you lose as a team, lowest player gets a Prison.  Some interesting decisions about which Pay cards to choose, and which cards to contribute when fighting cards - the simultaneous selection is fun.  Randomness of initial card draw can trump your decisions at time, but they're still there, and it plays very quickly (5-10 minutes) and is very fun despite that.  Any failings are redeemed by the fact that it's 1. so short; 2. so fun.  Part of the new tin-boxed card-game collection by Gryphon Games, which has lovely artwork.

Missing Musketeer card #8 with 4 swords
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
(12/18/2009) I was not pleased when I first saw this game--another trick-taking game that is a variant of a 52-card standard deck. I despise games like Wizard and Phase10 which are nothing more than a deck of standard cards (or several decks) and some rules. It's even more infuriating when there is a slapped-on artwork or theme, as in this case, but this game proved to be different...

The deck is 55 'fight' cards, with ranks ranging from 0 to 10, each rank having five. Within each rank, there are a number of swords (0 through 4)--think five different suits, which determines precedence when several players play a card of the same rank.

There are a number of 'Cardinal' enemy cards, ranked anywhere from 4 to 45 (specific cards are set aside depending on the number of players). There are also six cards dealt face up in the middle: three that have a gem on it, and three that represent the gallows. These affect scoring.

The game is played in rounds until somebody scores at least 100 pts. Each round 12 cards are dealt to all players, with the balance set aside; this means that players do not completely know if specific high/low cards made it into the current round, so card-counting is not possible. Players then lock in three scoring cards face-down. The number of points they receive at the end of the round is dependent on the rank. You could lock in a '10', but then that means you won't have it to take a future 'trick'. This is the clever feature/rule of this game.

Of each round, there are nine tricks/fights where an 'enemy' card is dealt face-up. Players then simultaneously select and reveal one of their fight cards. The total sum of all ranks must equal or beat the enemy card rank, kind of like the fight cards from Shadows Over Camelot. If the musketeers win, the player who played the highest rank will get a gem card, which they place on top of one of their scoring cards--this will double the value at the end. If the musketeers lose, the one who played the lowest card will get a gallows card, which will null out one of the scoring cards. Ties are broken by the number of swords on each card; more swords win. Later in the game, players can 'steal' gem cards from other players, have a gallows card reluctantly taken away, or release a gem/gallows card back into the middle depending on the outcome of the current trick/fight. If a player manages to get all three gem cards, the round is immediately over and scored. If a player gets all three gallows cards, they are "in jail", where they continue to play cards, but their rank does not contribute to the sum against the enemy cards! It sounded like War at first, but this is much like Condetierre.

Players need to determine, by themselves and without consultation, if they can collectively beat the enemy card rank or not. The key is to play a card just high enough that all of you win, or if you're going to lose, high enough so you don't get the gallows card. Sometimes you want to play a high card, just to get the gem card. You want to also save some high cards near the end of the round, so you can steal gems or lose gallows cards. So, this is an interesting game of bluffing and finesse, as well as "drawing trumps" to use a Bridge concept (e.g your '10' card, with 1 sword, is in danger of being covered by a '10' card with 2, 3, or 4 swords, so you'd be happy to see those cards drop in previous tricks, prior to committing your 10).

There is a heavy element of luck of the draw, so some rounds may be lop-sided, but should (I say "should", but there are no guarantees) even out if you're playing to 100 points. Although the theme is light and seems tacked on, I can understand way this was called Musketeers, as there is a semi-cooperative "All for one" feel to it, as we are all fighting against the Cardinal's guards. However, the humorous aspect is that one or two Musketeers may selfishly not pull their own weight, and collectively they lose! The cards are of excellent quality, and the mechanics alone hold up the game. The other plus is that it can be stopped at any time (if waiting for other players to show up), since there really is no emotional investment. It also scales nicely from 2 to 4 players. I'd say this is a very good, yet deceptively simple, card game that makes for an excellent filler that plays in 15-20 minutes, or 30-45 minutes if playing to 100 points. It's a good, solid "8".

(03/08/2014) 11 plays: Have not played this is over three years. Still a very good card game. Still holding at an "8".

Initial Rating: 6.5

At first I liked this light game a lot, but with subsequent plays I have come to think, the game has A LOT more luck than I initially though. However as the game plays so quickly I don´t care as much. It appears you have lots of interesting decisions, but as the luck is so prevalent your best laid plans can be unmade very easy. There are even times when you cannot win (as the cards dealt to you were so bad), no matter how good you play and that is a BIG minus for me.

I think I would like it better if all the players had the same musketeers cards available to play with. 

There is almost no theme on this one, but the art of the cards is pretty cool.

It can be fun IF you play with at least 3 players.

It's really puzzling why Gryphon/Pegasus chose to reprint this game. Totally obscure and forgotten, and when you play the game you can see why. I'm sure that it was worth playing at the time, but at this point it has been eclipsed by so many other games that it's really not worth playing.

Fun, light 5 minute filler. If it wasn't for the high amount of luck in the deal, I would rate this better. There is absolutely no way for a poor hand to win. A bit of card drafting might help, but the game is quite enjoyable in its own right.

Musketeers allows much more strategy if you play it with 1993 rules which said that you won directly if you got the three jewels on your three cards, not having to go through the nine fights. 
And obviously, you should play till one player reaches 100 points, which takes about 15-20 minutes depending on the number of rounds you need.
Doing so, while having a rather poor hand, you'll be able to maximize it by putting your best cards face down while helping an opponent to get three jewels before you get any jail... And scoring in average 50% of the winner's point in this round.

And hoping to do better in the next round...

Overall, I'd say that a real strength with Musketiere is, above its speed to be played, the real differences in game dynamics you feel with two, three or four players, as it's definitely also about psychology, not only luck.

A filler, yes, but a really good one.

If not go for For Sale, and have real fun.

It's a very simple game that can be explained in a minute. I thought it was going to be too simple, and in fact, it is indeed very light, but it is very fluid and you have some important decisions that add to the entertaining value.

There are some games where the luck of the draw will be ebough to win the game.

RATING: 7
Each turn in a round all players together (the musketeers) have got to play out enough points (face down) to beat a card that is turned up; if there's a win only the player who played out the highest card gets the reward, if there's a defeat only the player who played out the lowest card gets the punishment. The round ends when all cards have been played out or one player has rewards on all their scoring cards; players score according to the cards they have selected from their own hand for that purpose and to the rewards and punishments they have received. 

Musketiere boasts a fizzy combination - blind bidding and almost cooperative play. There is certainly some luck involved, even to the point that in some situations the difference between hands can't be compensated by clever play. This effect is the more apparent the less players are around the table: when two players are around the table a player with a strong hand will surely see less risk to have their cards trumped by other players - thus they will try to get the rewards straight away to finish the round quickly and with the highest possible score. Nevertheless, a player with a weak hand can still benefit from a sound choice of scoring cards and dodging punishments: a few points might not help win a round but maybe later the whole game.

Each player starts with 12 cards of varying values from 0-10.  Three cards are picked as hidden pay cards.  With the remaining 9 cards, all players collectively battle the Cardinal's Guard cards of varying values.  Flip a Guard card, then each player secretly selects 1 numbered card.  If the total of all cards played equals or exceeds the value on the Guard cards, then the player playing the hightest numbered card wins an emerad card to be placed on one of the 3 pay cards which doubles the value of that card at time of scoring.   If the total of all cards is less than value on Guard card, then the player with the lowest valued card places a prison card on one of their 3 pay cards making it unscorable at the game's end.  Play continues until one player gains all 3 emerald cards, or all 9 cards have been played.  Score points; winner is person with high score.  Long Play: reshuffle player cards and guard cards; play continues for several rounds with the winner being the first person to reach 100 or more points.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Interesting blind bidding game where you must decide which cards to set aside: high cards are worth more points but then you won't have them available to play so you may lose more fights. The luck factor, though, seems too high; especially in a 2-player game (where 31 cards are out of play each hand): probably better with more players, and if played over several rounds (to the 100pt target).

I wonder if it would have been better to give each player their own deck, with the #swords somehow distributed equally between players?

--- Summary ---
Setup: remove some specific Guard cards depending on the number of players. Shuffle and place all Guard cards in the center, along with the Gem and Prison cards. Shuffle the Musketeer cards (0-10 x 5, with varying #swords per card) and deal 12/player.

Play: players select 3 Musketeer cards to place face down; these are their potential rewards (Pay cards) this fight. Reveal the top Guard. Players simultaneously select a card, then reveal. If the sum is lower than the Guard strength, the player playing the lowest card (ties broken by # swords on card) places a Prison card on one of his Pay cards. Otherwise, the player with the highest card either places a Gem card on one of his Pay cards, or returns one of his Prison cards to the center. If center area doesn't have a card you need, take it from another player. If all you have 3 Prison cards, your played card doesn't add to the other players' cards.

The round ends after 9 fights, or if a single player ever collects all 3 Gem cards. Players earn silver for their Pay cards, doubled if a Gem is on top and reduced to 0 if a Prison is on top. The player with the most coins wins.

Play a single hand, or keep playing hands till someone gets 100 or more points, and the player with the most points wins.

It's a shame that the card draws are such a big factor in the outcome of the game, because this is otherwise a really fun little game. If you only a few high cards in your hand, you can either put low scoring junk cards in to your hand, in which case, you'll never win because you don't have enough points even if you doubled everything, or you stick your hire scoring cards in, but then end up in prison... A shame which undermines an otherwise promising little filler.

As a two-player game, Musketeers is pretty useless.  It's simply a matter of playing the highest cards you have on the first three turns and going for the gems.  If you get three tens, you're nearly guaranteed a win, so the game really comes down to who has the best draw of the cards right off the bat.  I get the feeling the game will improve with more players, but even still, I don't get the sense that the game has a whole lot going for it for me to want to keep it.

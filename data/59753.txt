Initial rating of 7.  A strange game.  Almost a re-imagining of [b]RA[/b].  I'd hesitate to say it's simpler than the original; though the play is similar, the decisions are all different.  I like it, but I'm not sure how it will split the table time with [b]RA[/b].

A version of Ra that's perhaps just a little easier to teach, a little nearer to a "family game". The auctions are still great, however many tiles, when drawn, require a small decision about which side to place face-up. One tiny thing I'm wary about, there is a *potential* here, if these decisions were laboured over, for the game to drag... on my first play this wasn't a problem, though.

Pontosan ugyanannyit adott játékélményben, mint a Ra, lényegében a lapkák mások. Tekinthetjük úgy is, mint egy Ra kieg, ami az újrajászhatóságot növeli meg. Nehezen tudnék dönteni, melyikkel játszanék szívesebben:)
Két személyes partit játszottunk, nagyon kevésnek tűnt a 3 korszak (elég gyorsan jöttek a Ra lapkák), ezért mi egy 4-dik, ráadást is játszottunk, de a sorrend már nem változott.
---
Pozitívabb hangulatú, mint a Ra. Minusz pontot itt egyedül a játék végén, egyetlen lapkatípusért lehet kapni, ezért nem is sok értelmét látom a szabály azon kitételének, hogy minuszba nem mehet át a pont. (Ez az eredeti Ra szabályból maradhatott benne). Az eredeti Ra-ban rengeteg módon büntetett a játék, sokkal több lapkatípus esetén kellett versengeni. Itt csak az emberlapkák esetén számít, hogy hogyan szerepeltünk a többiekhez képest, na és a játék legvégén a napkövek értékénél. Minden más szempontért a többi játékostól függetlenül kapjuk a pontot. 
Ezért stresszesebb, kudarckerülőbb játékosoknak mindenképpen ez az újabb változat javasolt.

This reworking of Ra gets new and more colorful components, and a slightly revamped scoring. All in all it's not so different from the original (then it's quite a good game!), but seems slightly inferior and more casual-player oriented: there's less penalties and less differences in scoring paths. If one must choose one for its collection, Ra wins. The two games are not different enough to both deserve a spot in a collection? Probably...

Excellent game. Even though we have Ra the Dice Game as well as Razzia! we really like PoR a lot. One of our new favorites, and glad I traded for it.

Update: The more we play it, the more we like it! Raised from 9 to 10.

We start the Ra tiles at 3 for a 2-P game so it does not end so quickly.

It is like Ra. But it takes a bit longer to draw tiles out of the bag, and then you have to decide which side of the tile should be placed up. So gameplay is somewhat slower.

A new flavor of Ra. It played fine and provides a few more choices. Easy for Ra players to pick up and play, but I like the original better. I didn't think it needed to be improved upon, but I'm not disappointed with this effort. Still not sure you need to own both though.

Played Ra on the iPad and enjoyed, the games group bought a few copies fo the game as a bit of a filler game / end of night game. Preety true to the original game and enjoyable, the family also enjoyed the game, once played the rules are not too complicated to get your head around.

RATING: 8
I love Ra, so I am hardly going to dislike this, because it is essentially Ra with a different scoring system. I don't think the tile flipping adds an awful lot so I really have to question why anybody would want to create this game - it effectively adds nothing to the canon.

However, if you enjoy Ra, you will get exactly the same enjoyment out of POR. If you have never played Ra you might as well learn POR as Ra itself. It is a great game, but if you have Ra, don't bother.

Edit: slightly downgraded after 2nd play, I still prefer Ra.

I like RA, so I should like this right? No ...

I really don't see why there was any need to fiddle with RA at all. This game has double sided tiles which don't add any more 'excitement' to the game - rather just downtime while the tile drawer decides which side to put it on the track. All the interesting bits of RA have been removed (farms and floods, kings, civ tiles and disasters - instead you have just one bad tile that increases in penalty the more you collect).

All in all, didn't like it. If you don't like RA this won't change your mind. If you do like RA I can't see any point in getting this at all.

Overall, if RA is available I'd never play this, and if it wasn't I'm not sure I'd want to bother playing it in any case.

Oh, and there weren't enough scoring chits for us in our 5 player game, and I'm sure that wasn't because we were scoring high, rather the mix is the same as RA but in this game there is much less to reduce your score.

An interesting variation on the original.  The game plays very similarly, but I like the variability introduced through the new tiles.  The variety of tiles and the flexibility with which they can be used makes for a more dynamic and interactive game.  Ra is still probably the more refined auction game (on of the very best), but Priests of Ra is a very solid spin on the original with enough differences to make it a fascinating game.

What an interesting and extremely good looking game.   It plays identically to the original Ra mechanically, but the scoring is entirely different.  This means that the decisions for value are completely different.   I wouldn't say it's better than the original ra, but neither is it worse.  It's simply different, and since I really like the original Ra, this is a fine game.

Rating started at 8.  Perhaps this will move to a 7 or 9 depending on further plays.

It's funny, while Ra's issues have caught up with it over time (mainly, the very high level of chaos often leaving some players without good choices, and the need to manage your suns often constraining you too much), Priests of Ra has held up to time much better. The simpler scoring and smaller gamespace makes it much more reliably interesting and with more reliably tough choices. I'm actually not totally sure I would play Ra again by choice, but I'd play Priests of Ra.
---
Awesome. Initial impression is that it's got virtually all the depth and interest of Ra at a significantly lower complexity level and a cleaner, slightly quicker playing package. And it does play quite differently from the original. Not quite enough VP chips for the endgame, though.
---
Just got my copy in, hugely looking forward to trying it. It looks like a somewhat smoother variant on the same core engine as Ra ... not sure if that means it's more accessible but with a little less depth, or if it's just different. Looking forward to finding out.

Simple rules. Elegant and bright game. Likable graphic. 

You better keep all your eyes on:

* what tiles your opponent needs to collect scores
* what suns are in trade and who will have what for future auctions
* what auction and Ra track show.

It's interesting to play when there're more than two players.

I really like Ra! This edition, Priests of Ra, is worse in my opinion, but it's still a good game hence my rating. I'm not a big fan of the buildings you need to get in different colors as it seems you may end the game with more of some which you don't need. It's not entirely the same in Ra (though, of coures, if you have 5 Pharaos and your opponents have 3, you might say that you would only need 4). Also, the Ankhs seemed to be too easy to get when I played, so I didn't need to collect any people token at all in the 3rd epoch, which was kind of lame... Still, it's a decent game, but I will always prefer to play the original Ra, and as you don't really need both of the games, I would recommend buying Ra (but my GF and my brother prefer Priests of Ra, so really, it's a matter of taste).

I don't understand the need for this game. And I'm a Ra fan. I'm not a Ra zealot, who spurns anything but the original. I enjoy Razzia for a slightly simpler (and significantly more portable) version. I also like the dice version. But this... I don't understand. Some things are simpler, some more complex. So what's the goal? A couple things are arguably better, while others worse. The tile flipping aspect I don't like at all. 90% of the time either it doesn't matter what side you pick, or it's obvious. Very disappointed.

Played it first time at Games club. Not played RA, but see n it being played. I quite like this. Priest tiles change the strategy

edit
My son said it felt like there was something missing in the gameplay. The  game feels dry after a couple of plays...the hope of wanting to the game to be better the next time evaporates as you realise it's pretty much playing itself. No real interaction, Epochs finish too quickly and you feel you havent drawn enough tiles, however, even though your civilisations are all incomplete, all players run out of VP points!

Ra reinvented.  Players take turns adding a tile to the auction pool, or invoking Ra to kick off an auction for the tile lot.  You can only win three auctions per epoch, and there is only three epochs per game, so a lot of thought has to go into where you commit.  Scoring for holdings occurs at the end of each epoch and highest wins the game.  Essentially the same game mechanically as Ra, which means it's one of the best of all time.  However there is an entirely new tile set and rules for scoring.  Some tiles are flippable, which adds to the playing time as you ponder which side you want the tile to be played.  The disasters are gone, but long term plagues appear and hang around.  Priests let you get creative with your holdings, and there are buildings for long term strategies.  Excellent reinvention of Ra, but loses a point over the original for the flip tiles, which do bog the game down compared to the breezy original when playing with more than two players.  Still very good though, and thoroughly excellent with two players.

It's strange the way Ra is a top 100 game, with its position strengthened by a new FF reissue, whereas Priests of Ra languishes wherever it is that it lies. The games are so similar that if asked to play one over the other I would probably just alternate between the two. However I do prefer the scoring in Ra, which is one of my favourite games of all time (the ipad version is very good and very quick), but if I had one and not the other I wouldn't feel as if I was missing anything. If I was going to get one, I'd get Ra, however the secondhand prices for this are ludicrously low so maybe that would swing it also the wooden bidding tokens and the wooden Ra gavel (what else to call it) are better than the bits in the reissue by a million miles. Though the tiles are nicer. 

I don't think I can add much that hasn't been said about this game, but the fact that this auction game plays excellently with just two is a massive plus. FUN.

We traded away RA and kept Priests of Ra. I enjoy the pyramid building aspect better than collecting nile tiles, and I like the way the plague tiles work better in Priests. Priests also feels like a slightly kinder game, and the scores have generally been closer than in Ra, where we usually had one person with a stupidly high score, and everyone else fighting for second.

Priests of Ra is just a variant of Ra with different tiles and scoring. The game is a bit more strategic and less prone to luck. It is also more pleasant visually, with colorful and detailed art. The downside is that the new tiles are less interesting compared to those in the original game and don't favor specialisation, making each game a bit samey. Ra remains the more fun and unpredictable, but Priests is a valid alternative if you have played the original to death.

Two games with three, three with four and one with five. 

It's Ra, but with completely new tiles and thus completely different scoring. The only scoring element retained from the original is the -5/+5 for lowest/highest sun total at the end. What makes it sufficiently different from Ra to make it worth playing is the fact that some tiles are double-sided, which adds a new decision into the mix.

Some people have speculated that the game is "too nice" because the disasters have been replaced by the more generic plagues. Not really...if anything, I feel like there's a slightly heightened sense of competition in Priests of Ra because of the people majorities; it might be the meaner game of the two. The majorities also mean that you have to pace yourself through the rounds more, since you don't want to spend a lot on a bunch of people only to see someone else outstrip you on the cheap.

It's interesting how the two games have different feels. What's nice about the original is that players can focus on different things and so have vastly different holdings from each other. On the other hand, players are a bit more involved with each other in Priests of Ra. 

I think Priests of Ra is a very good game, but in the end I think I prefer the original. Part of the reason is that the choosing between the tile sides slows the game down a bit (since you have to examine everyone else's holdings). The other part is that the original is so well-known and beloved by gamers that they are always going to be more enthusiastic about playing that one.

Nice variant of RA. 
A variant that makes it a deeper game, but also - maybe - a longer game. 

UPDATE
After two plays this is going strong. I like it, I want to play it. Solid "8" from me. I prefer this to basic RA. 

UPDATE
This game's becoming rapidly a favourite on our table.

Beautiful game. This is a very very good game and gets a solid 9 for its genre.

Ra’s (one of the best auction games ever) twin (and worthy) brother.

Is it indispensable if you already have Ra? Probably not, but the little variations make it definitely worth a try (and the art is nice). 

Rio Grande made player’s aid for Ra the dice game, they should have done it here too, since the scoring is the only tricky stuff in the game (it’s printed on the board, but quite small). It’s really the only (minor) complaint I have about this game.

Definitely of a similar calibre to its elder sibling, so the game is at least brilliant. I am unsure which of the two versions I prefer, so it might even be better than merely brilliant.

I like the original and I like this just the same.  It is a truly great auction game, with a little push your luck element, and a complex scoring system that makes the bids more tense and less calculable.  Its easy, has little downtime, and is a very deep game.  This new version (which changes very little) is basically the same.  The new one seems slightly more forgiving, as there are less negative points, but also has less tension, because you don't live in fear of getting a bunch of negatives either. Priests also removed the probably too powerful god tiles, and adds the nicely strategic flipping mechanism.  

Overall i think Priests is a little tighter design, and is probably slightly better balanced, but the original RA has more tension, and is a little more strategic.  I still think you cannot go wrong with either one, as both are excellent games.

I like the idea of the theme, but in the ends is a facade and has little impact on the gameplay.

same as the old Ra but with a twist: switching tiles.
It is a really good improve of the old game that mitigates luck in the draw.But i was not a big fan of the old RA and so my feeling are the same with this title.Anyway Fan of old RA could find a better game.

Well, it does still keep some solid parts of Ra.  The bidding works just as well.

The tile flipping was a great idea, but horribly executed.  Only a few tiles have different backs, and they really are only a different color of the same damn thing.  So it really didn't add that many decisions at all.

There are much fewer types of tiles, so the lots become similar value to everyone which breaks the point of Ra.

They didn't even include enough score chits for goodness sakes.

It's still okay, but not great.

I knew the reputation of RA but didn't want to pay the big money so I read a few reviews on BGG and watched a couple of videos of PoR. I bought a copy off eBay (un-punched for £7.50)and have really enjoyed it. I find people pick up the bidding idea pretty quickly and the set collection for the types of people and pyramid tiles. Have played with mainly 4 or 5 and this seems to work well. For the price the board & pieces are brill. Of course we have a rule when you invoke RA you MUST yell RAAA!

I really like the original ("Ra") even though I'm not the best at it.  However this standalone variant of Ra I just don't see the reason for... at least not after one play.  This version while it may sound like a "simpler" version of Ra on the surface, I actually found more work/time consuming on my turn as now you have to look around and see what everyone has on most tile draws so you know which side to place face up.  Plagues also seem more harsh than Ra's disaster tiles, at least with a disaster it's one time... in PoR the same plagues may plague you for all 3 epochs... not to mention get worse.

Maybe after another play or two I can adjust my rating, for now take it for what it's worth.

Well, I was afraid this was going to be yet another of Reiner's games being dumbed down for the family market, but I am happy to say that it doesn't seem that way: PoR seems to have at least as much depth (thanks in part to the two-sided tiles) as Ra.

Scoring mechanisms are as opague as in Ra, but in different ways, of course. The artwork of Ra is far superior, though: PoR has garish, brightly-colored artwork compared with the more subdued, elegant artwork of Ra.

Ra is like an old friend, whereas PoR is the new pretender, so it's difficult to compare them objectively. For now, I much prefer original Ra, but how much of that is because of sheer conservatism is hard to say. For all I know, PoR might end up the more interesting of the two.

RATING: 7
Game play is almost exactly the same as Ra but with a (slightly) different scoring system, albeit still about set collection and majority scoring. The scoring does seem a little more forgiving than its parent.

I like Ra so I like this too, but (unless you can buy it cheaply) you'd need to absolutely love Ra to buy this too.

Printing off some player aids that cover the scoring would help new or occasional players, as while the scoring is not complicated I found myself struggling to decipher the scoring rules on the board that are printed in a tiny font and in German.

RATING: 7
A sequel to the modern classic [thing=12][/thing], Priests of Ra overlaps quite substantially with the original game. If you're familiar with the [family=17][/family], [thing=36218][/thing], [family=150][/family], [family=2][/family], or [family=19][/family] game families, you know what I'm talking about. This is Ra but with a different tile set. Same board, same suns, same draw/invoke rules. 

The rules for Ra/PoR are incredibly simple. On your turn, you either draw a tile, or invoke Ra (which means you can bang a wooden piece on the table and bellow "Ra!"). If you draw, the tile is added to the board. If you invoke, players may use their suns (goodwill with the Sungod Ra) in a once-around bid for various bits and pieces of ancient Egyptian civilization (all of the tiles on the board). The brilliance of Ra is the discrete bidding system. Have you ever been in a round of Power Grid where a Power Plant goes up for auction at 35 and the bidding goes up in increments of one all the way to 60? Well, forget that. Here you choose one of your suns and if its not good enough, tough. If your suns seem too low or too high for the current lot, too bad. Even better, the winning sun becomes part of the next lot. So you might really want the tiles available, and at the same time you want to avoid winning a stretch of low-value suns. Your opponents know this. They will leverage it. 

Ra / Priests of Ra are deep games. Despite the simplicity, there is a lot to scrutinize. You can try to tempt your opponents out of the round early and draw solo runs from the bag. If you're too picky you lose the opportunities to win anything at all with one or more of your suns. You can try to keep the lots going if you're sitting on the trump sun and the lot is already 'past the point of no return.' You must know when to cut it short if an opponent is already sure to bid and you cannot stop them. You can position to get stuff that is way better than your lowly sun but pretty crappy for your opponent's high suns. And so on. And that's all irrespective of the actual tile-set, which adds a lot. 

Priests of Ra is designed to be slightly more intuitive than Ra, it has fewer scoring penalties, and the scoring itself is less finely grained. Other than that: same game, new tiles. If you like one, you should like the other.

Had this existed before Ra, it would deserve a higher rating.  As it is, I do not understand the point of the game.  It is SO similar to Ra that it really makes no sense.  If the goal was to reach a broader audience, that would be great.  But that's definitely not going to happen with this product.  The audience seems exactly the same as the first game.  So why?

Is it a fun game?  Sure it is.  I love Ra.  This IS Ra.

Priests of Ra feels pretty similar to Ra in the choices to be made (draw a tile, call Ra) as well as in the challenge (relative valuation, how greedy to be).

But I don't know, pretty much all the tiles are different and almost all the scoring is different.  I have seen a lot of people saying that the game is lighter, which may be correct, but being set in my Ra ways, I found it difficult to remember all the different ways that things score and continually found myself asking about the scoring.  Why is there no individual player aid?  The board itself is not enough, as it's not easily visible for all players.

I suppose these problems will go away as I play it more.  The plagues are an interesting addition, but I think I like the more individualized disasters more in Ra.  I also like the immediacy of the need to get civilization tiles in Ra.  There's nothing, except for the plagues, that will get you negative points each round, so it feels like there's less excitement. 

But the premise of the game is the same.  Is it worth spending my sun to acquire this set?  Just how greedy should I be?

I think that if you enjoy Ra, you'll like this.  But I will probably find myself wanting to play Ra more, but I'm not sure how much of that is due to familiarity, or whether Ra really is that much better of a game.

Certainly a better branding success than Strozzi, but not as good as the Keltis spin-offs.

In normal "Ra", you pull a tile or start an auction.  In this game, you pull a tile then stall while trying to decide which side to put face-up.  Extra AP without any extra fun.  

Also, the lack of negative tiles is annoying.  In particular, I find that sets are generally similarly valued for all players, which I don't like as much.

RATING: 7
While I think there is plenty of room for alternate tile sets for Ra (even if they are sold as complete games, not expansions), I don't think Priests of Ra succeeds.

First, most of the tiles are double-sided, and which side goes up is decided when the tile is drawn. These decisions are between different colours, however, not different types of tiles, which leeches a lot of the interest out of an interesting twist. Often the decision is inconsequential, and most of the rest of the time it is straightforward, but takes a moment while you take stock of the other players' positions. As a result, PoR plays noticeably slower than it's parent game with little return.

Second, the role of negativity in Ra is easy to underestimate, and it is almost completely absent here. In Ra, disasters have multiple, interesting effects on play, both when it comes to affecting the decision to "go for it" when you have good suns and an auction lot that is already juicy, and in creating tactically interesting in the values of auction lots between different players. The vaguely analogous plagues in Ra are boring, by comparison. There is also nothing comparable to the "race" for fewest pharaohs.

Therefore, in spite of a couple interesting scoring ideas, Priests of Ra ends up diluted, overly long and rather lacking in the delicious tension that makes the original game a classic. It is still a decent game when taken on its own – the underlying Ra engine is still one of the pinnacles of game design – and Ra addicts will get enough play out of Priests to make it worth picking up. It's always going to suffer by comparison, though, and there is almost nothing here that would lead me to recommend it over Ra as an introduction to the system.

01/14/10 Obtained. Upon opening the box I was quite annoyed by how small the text on the board concerning scoring was. How anyone more than two feet away could possibly read it is beyond me. What made it doubly hard to read was not only the size of the text but the font used. And don't get me started on the text on the other side of the board being in German on this RGG edition. The thin tile draw bag is barely large enough to hold all the tiles. I substituted a larger bag that you could actually get you hand inside a draw a tile from the bottom of the bag. That's impossible with the bag that came in the game. I also feel the victory point tablets are insufficient. By epoch two I'm constantly having to make change with players. There should have been more overall, or at least less 10's and more 2's and 5's. 
02/02/10 Played a four-player game with guys very familiar with the original Ra. It was well received. I believe their view was the same as mine. Priests of Ra is neither better nor worse that the original, just somewhat different. As I don't own Ra I deemed Priests of Ra worth buying. But owning both is not worthwhile, as they are about 70% the same. The game scales well from 3 to 5 players.    

As of 12/20/17 I've played 21 times: thrice with five, 5 times were with four, and 13 were three-player affairs.

Different enough to exist alongside Ra, and for both to be played; however, I don't think one needs to own both. Pick either. Someone you know will likely own the other. If they don't, you're not missing that much as they're very similar in principle, though the scoring works differently. This one's probably marginally better, though I prefer the art and presentation of the original.

It's the same bidding process as Ra but with a new tile set and scoring system. Problem is, the new tile set is a lot more scoring friendly: fewer disasters, more "pharoah" races to compete in, the option of choosing which colour side to place when you pull tiles (to help make it more or less attractive to you / others), no "must have" tiles - all meaning a lot less tension. You feel if you don't get this auction you'll probably get what you want in a future one anyway. It's pleasant and I'd happily play, but there's nothing in there pulling me back.

I fell in love with Ra when I first got seriously into the hobby, way back when. I picked up Razzia cheap from Germany which scratched the Ra itch, so I've never bothered to buy Ra. When this went on sale at "The Works" it seemed a good idea to buy it, which it was. It is a good half way mark between Ra & Razzia, I don't envisage having to now buy Ra. Need to try and play it a bit more.

RATING: 5
Priests of Ra is basically the same as Ra, so it's a good game. The most important change is that most tiles are two-sided, which makes the tile drawing slower (also because you must now draw them from a bag). This rather destroys the rythm of the game. Scoring seems to be more convoluted than in the original game. There is no reason to play this if you have the original.

I'm deducting points for confusing a friend of mine when playing the one and only real Ra.

This isn't terrible, but I have no idea why I would play this instead of Ra. Maybe if this had come out before Ra or I didn't know the original game, I would like this better, but that's not the case. Also, having two-sided tiles seemed to add complexity without really adding depth.

Very confusing game to teach and learn, but fun once it's figured out.  So far this has been far more successful as a 2 player game, mainly due to the steep learning curve.

We play this not infrequently at our local club when we have 30-45 minutes to fill up - and I must say that, while I don't think this is a great game, it's a nice lightish auction game, very typical of Knizia. Note that I have never played the original Ra, so I cannot compare this to that - but I find it quite interesting and with a fair bit to think about each turn. It also has the merit of virtually no downtime (at least until you've won all the auctions you're allowed to for the turn).

very much my least favourite in the Ra family (including Razzia). I'm not sure what it is, but mostly I don't see too much point to the double-sided tiles which seem to ever so slightly increase the length of the game and a distraction from the main gameflow.

I am not a big fan or regular Ra, but I really liked Priests of Ra.  The core mechanics are the same, but the tile set is completely different -- and created more of the type of experience I want.  I thought there was more information about who wanted what, without as much specialization making it TOO obvious who wants what.  A nice balance!

As Priests of Ra replaces the disaster mechanic for the friendlier plague it does away with my favorite aspect of Ra. The base Ra mechanics make this a fine game but I love the original and would always rather play that.

Essen 2009. Seems to be common policy, to take a successful design and then publish a series of slightly varied games based on the same mechanics. Look at Catan, Carcassonne, Cartagena... It's done all the time, so why am I a little disappointed? 

A good game, for sure. But personally I think, this variation doesn't add significantly to the RA experience as f.e. Keltis Oracle did to the original Keltis, or even the Samurai and Modern Art card games to their predecessors. Compared to RA/Razzia, the gameplay feels slowed down by the new tiles. Each turn it just takes slightly more time to evaluate your opponents' display, resulting in added complexity and less tension. And why they did print a score overview on the game board itself instead of providing extra little player overview charts as in 'Ra dice game' eludes me totally. The new scoring system seems less cruel for family play, but it is also less enthralling and more obscure. 
 
Personally I'll stick with Knizia's Razzia or the RA dice game, which plays sufficiently different to warrant a lasting space in my cramped games rack.

One play.  Ra with a different selection of tiles.  They add some extra strategy, as you have to choose which way up they go, but the rest of hte game is fairly similar.  I wont' be buying it, as we already have Ra, but will happily play it as often as Ra.  One slight issue - with 5 players we ran out of money at final scoring!

The theme and scoring are actually intuitive, and I found this game far more interactive and easier to grasp than most so-called "gateway" games. I'd definitely pick this one over Ticket or Settlers. Great non-auction auction mechanic.

Wow, what's the point here?  To me, it's just a less interesting version of Ra.  The only interesting change ot me is the use of double-sided tiles--and it's not that big of a deal.  Other than that, what's the point.  I think I might enjoy this more if I had never played Ra, so my biased opinion might not mean much.  I'm just really unhappy with this game.  [01/08/2011]

RATING: 3.5
-Rating after solo play (ha!)
And 3 games of Ra (ha-ha!)

I was just commenting on Ra that it would need a graphic redesign and here it is, only it doesn't quite work. I mean from visual point of view. But it's the same on gameplay level as well: doesn't quite work. 

On graphics: I've seen many comments how PoR looks cuter and is more family friendly and while the latter is probably true the game itself is less thematic. Firstly the scope - in Ra you're building kingdoms, here you're just managing households or maybe cities (one pyramid, couple of buildings, some workers). Secondly the art is cute, but not evoking any theme or setting rather than being in function of cute (it's neither stylized nor realistic art) - hence it just emphasises that you're collecting different sets as this is now clearly visible. Compare 5 different civilization tiles in Ra to different colour chambers, meh. 

On gameplay (based on solo play and other people's comments): Ra is a tableau building game with auction and some interesting risk taking. Here risk taking is diluted (absence of disasters, also no negative scoring) - decisions are less interesting (and adrenaline inducing) making the game a VP collecting frenzy. Also there were reports of players not differentiating in strategy hence bidding is much more symmetrical (all lots of equal worth to all players) - didn't notice it soloing, but might be true. On tile flipping - it's a minor detail (you can choose between 2 colours of a tile which is important for set collecting) which is not important because it's trivial (it's quite obvious which side to choose). 

So apparently this was made for those who find tension and risk taking in games frustrating and find this fluffy version "fun". Me not so: for me tension IS the fun part. 

EDIT: it's the same thing as Ra. A bit less tension and not a good theme implementation. But much nicer looking. And 2 sided tiles are a neat idea. Until they do a graphic redesign of Ra, I'd rather play this. 
EDIT 2: A bit bored by both these games, but I'd rather play this now, because: visuals. Don't judge me! (or, do, if it makes you happier)

A szerző a Ra kiadása után 1 évvel kiadta annak átdolgozását. Lényegében ugyanazt a játékot még egyszer. Ez nem túl szép dolog mégsem tudok rosszabb pontot adni a Rá papjaira, mint a nagy elődre, mert ugyanolyan jó. Más lapkák vannak, csak egyetlen mínuszt hozó van köztük, tehát családibb a játék. Kimondottan tetszett a kétoldalas lapkák ötlete, amit a húzója dönt el hogyan rak le. A játékélményben azonban én nem éreztem sem pozitív, sem negatív változást és mivel nem akarok a másolásért pontot levonni így ugyanannyira értékelem, mint az elődöt. Ha valakinek megvan az egyik szerintem semmi értelme a másik beszerezésének. Aki a kevésbé konfrontatív játék híve annak ezt ajánlom inkább.

I'd just prefer regular RA, however if you don't like the disaster tiles of RA and you don't like that you can lose points in RA, then this may be the version for you as I believe all the points are positive points only and I don't believe there are any disaster tiles.

Like with the games in the Keltis franchise, Knizia again succeeds in taking a core mechanism and designing a fresh new game around it.

Although Priests of Ra is less tense and maybe even more friendly than Ra, it's still a very good game in its own right. I would recommend this to every fan of Ra who's looking for something different but similar.

Take Ra. Leave the mechanics alone (barring a couple of tiny changes to tile-pulling and auction winning), then go and change [i]absolutely everything[/i] about how scoring works and therefore how you have to evaluate lots of tiles for auction.

So ... its just like Ra except it's totally different. A strange (but not unpleasant) experience.

I'm a little torn about how to rate this. For all intents and purposes, it is a Ra clone, and Ra is one of just a handfull of games that I rate as a 10. That means Priests of Ra is a 10, yes? Well, it certainly makes some interesting tweaks, but that's all they are, so Priests of Ra just doesn't have enough that's new or different from the original game to rate a 10 in my book. I think Priests of Ra may appeal a bit more to those folks (and there are many) who don't quite "get" the nuances of Ra and think it's all luck. Why? Because the choice of which side of a tile to place face-up in Priests of Ra will give some people an illusion of control. But, the real control is still in when to draw versus when to call an auction, and folks who didn't understand that in Ra won't succeed in Priests of Ra, either. I think Priests of Ra may be a tiny bit more forgiving than Ra, but not much. Hey, I love Ra and this puts a fresh coat of paint on one of my favorite game engines, so I'll happily play. I just kinda wish the changes were a bit more substantive.

Yup, it's Ra.  If you already own Ra, you probably don't need to spend the money to get this.  If you don't own Ra, I'd buy this version.

It is more visually appealing than Ra, and you're making slightly more worthwhile choices, and the scoring system is better; however they aren't grand sweepingly awesome changes, they are only mild tweaks.  they also make teaching the game a teensy bit harder, and they make the playtime a teensy bit longer.

There's little reason for this game to exist: most of the mechanics are the same as what you'd find in the original Ra, and I feel the original does things better.

On the plus side, the scoring setup for people is well done: you simultaneously want different types and a lot of the same type and you're potentially competing with other players for these too.  Combine this with the ability of priests to flip tiles and it's an interesting, satisfying mechanic.

Unfortunately, the other aspects are generally worse.  Most tiles are double-sided and you get to choose which side is face-up when you draw it from the bag; this can offer some interesting decisions, but the choice is usually obvious but still takes time to determine, significantly increasing the length of the game.  The buildings are also implemented poorly - there's no visual or logical reason for 2 buildings of a color to create a "complete" building.

Overall it's still basically Ra so it's still a good game, but there's no situation I would recommend this over Ra.

I like the bidding system in this game a lot. It often becomes a game of chicken and you also have to balance the cost of using your best bidding chips at different times as they confer advantage in the following round. Scoring is a little convoluted though and feel it would take a few games to get used to this and be able to better play and enjoy the game. Want to play more with 3+ players felt that it was a bit dry with 2.

I was surprised to discover how different this feels from [thing=12][/thing].  Yes, the core auction mechanism is absolutely identical, but the tiles are 100% different (except for the Ra tiles, of course), and there is nothing similar with [thing=12][/thing] about the way you collect them or score them.  Additionally, buildings and people are mostly two-sided, allowing you to choose which type you are putting on the auction block when you draw it.  This is a factor in your decisions, but it doesn't weigh as heavily on the game as I might have expected.  An example of a big difference is that rather than having disasters that instantaneously and immediately destroy tiles, you have plagues that are (triangularly) cumulative badness, and are hard to eradicate.  This is a worthy purchase alongside [thing=12][/thing], although I'd have preferred to have an option to buy only the new tiles and ankhs.

Why this, when there is Ra? Too similar to be anything really interesting. The original is simply good enough. Though, this is still different enough with its scoring mechanics, so not a complete duplicate.

Vye is an absolutely gorgeous card game that's very simple to explain and play. Basically, you are playing and attempting to control cards in front of you, largely by manipulating the board through your four family members: an advisor, a king, a queen, and an heir. These all give you control of cards in different ways -- at the end of the deck, the player with the largest contiguous group of cards is the winner. 

This is a fun concept that looks like it evolved from a game played with a standard deck of cards and some markers. The art is absolutely out of this world, which is important for gateway games -- it reminds me of a cross between Dixit and Heiko Gunther's minimalism. Very nice. 

Gameplay is good, and ultimately all comes down to when you play your family members, using their powers to disrupt the other player's group. This is a simple decision but a difficult one to make, because your best family members pack the biggest punch, but will also be the ones you're tempted to use soonest. Often, the threat of playing a family member card is enough to keep control of an area.

Fantastic artwork.  I love how each land card type has 4 members.  Securing territory is great, and the family members add a nice twist to it.  The special cards are like mini-expansions and have an awesome impact on the game.

Really fun, meaty, approachable, and quick.

Very solid game. Easy to play. Some real strategy yet enough chance of cards you get to mitigate the chance that one person will just always win every time you play. It's a good balance. The special cards can be folded in for different play styles and to make the game more-or-less lucky, strategic, liable to swing wildly, or aggressive.

The mechanics of the game force you to boot others out of their land. At the start, you can end up with no or almost no cubes on the board at the start of each of your turns. But as the map grows, you're able to establish your kingdom(s) and start trying to protect it or attack others. The rough start helps to get one over the hump of feeling like it's mean to kick people out or mean of them to kick you out because, like I said, it's just how the mechanics of the game work. So I think that even people who don't like conflict will be able to enjoy it.

The only real negative of the game is the lack of description on the special cards. You have to refer to the rulebook for each one, until you've memorized them all.

Area control games aren't really my style - I hate that feeling of grabbing an area only to have it stolen from you, or the feeling of screwing someone else's plan.  

OK card game with lovely artwork.  There's a feeling there is an idea for a game lurking just under the surface, but it never really seems to get fully drawn out.  Played twice with basic cards.  I can see the potential variety with the slightly more advanced cards added into the mix.  I'm not sure there's enough here to really hold my attention of the many other games I already own.

Simple premise, simple area-control gameplay, beautiful artwork. In fact, it was the artwork that drew me to this game; the first Kickstarter campaign I ever backed. Special cards need rules printed on them, IMO, and there's a lot of placing and removing of cubes. Still, it's fast, easy to introduce, and too pretty to keep off the table. Happy to have supported it, and will hang on to it.

As game designers, we have to admit that 'Vye' has some of the best packaging and graphic design we've seen for such a compact game in a long time!

The art is one of the strongest features of this game, while some of the images can at times, be slightly confused for each other, this adds to the mystery of the realm you are constantly attempting to dominate.

The first time we saw the images of 'the 5 families', we immediately thought 'this is what decks of playing cards should look like!' Very chic, cool and avant garde.

2-player games go quick and will always leave you asking for a re-match!

After receiving the game we are updating our score to a resounding 10. It was 9 without the art, but with the art it's even better. Plus it comes with the special cards, which we weren't playing with before. All of this together gives you a card game which we love!

I highly recommend this game if you're looking for a short game that is very easy to teach and grasp. The length of time can be modified a bit with the number of sets of land cards and special cards you're playing with. Our games are 10-15 minutes with the minimum number of cards, with the next level up taking about 20-25 minutes depending on how much people think about stuff. Oh, and the game plays the same with more players as it does with 2 players.

My original comments:

My wife and I tried this game with a normal deck of cards(I'm fairly certain that is what the designers used to create the game) and some coins as the tokens. Message me if you want help figuring that out so you don't have to waste the paper printing the game!

My wife and I enjoyed the game. It's very simple to learn, it could be taught in just a few minutes. The game play is pretty quick at 15-30 depending on how long players take to consider their moves.

We backed because the game was fun and the art is awesome! If you are on the fence and have read the negative comments about the backer names then I suggest you take a look at the Kickstarter page. The names aren't that pronounced and blend into the card. Look for yourself before you write it off completely.

Overall we can't wait for our copy to come in the mail in 2015! I will update this comment when we can actually play the full game, possibly updating the score as well.

#Kickstarter Vye is a very strategic and deep game and it would never strike you as thata, since it is basically a single deck of cards and some cubes.

I saw games completely turn around in the last turn though and this is a feat that not many games have.

On a negative note, it takes space to play this. It is tableau creation mechanic at it's best, but we are talking Rubens' size here, so be prepared ;)

Not bad... I'm usually all for games of opportunism but here I just felt like I was a little TOO at the mercy of the cards pretty often. There's some neat little tricks you can do when you can pull them off - I'm just not convinced pulling them off is really in your hands.

The art is like, double-plus amazing though!

I got the print and play final playtest version before release, and last night we cracked it open and played  few rounds. Immediatly, this game was a hit. It is so easy to explain and to learn that even the least experienced gamer at the table quickly felt confident playing. At the same time, the more experienced players were not at any extreme advantage. Highly recommended.

The game is essentially tile laying area control game but with cards instead of tiles. Not all cards are interesting and not all setups work well and every strategy has a clear and predictable pattern. The art is gorgeous, though.

very interesting tactical and strategic battle back and forth whilst building a larger and larger card grid -- one must stop and think, and ponder whether to play the family trump card early or hold back -- great tactical battle as your land mass grows and shrinks with every card -- the newer cards add loads to the strategy -- however the 'Fortress' card just tends to strip away a load of sweeping tactics, as The Fortress just tends to protect what each player has, and therefore it segregates the play and everyone is content just to build in their own area -- would always take this card out as it just hinders a really good gaming session -- would always play this when it is tabled
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 1
I haven't played much, but I am hugely disappointed thus far, and don't expect to log many more plays. The early game feels meaningless, as other players are bound to have similar land types and conquer your cards. Also, the nature of conquering lands, makes the game incredibly swingy, and in a very unsatisfying way. The rulebook lists setups for various game lengths, and I find anything shorter than 'Long' to be unplayable, as is playing with 4 players. The 2p game is the most enjoyable, but it doesn't wave a finger at any of the other 2p experiences available.

Cleaver fun card game. The art is stunning. Best with a group of people. Some of the card rules are over powered. We no longer give each player a Fortress card when playing with those as it became rather boring. We will mix 1 or more into the draw deck so it is random as to who gets that card.

Wow, total sleeper. Impulse bought this game because I was looking for a pretty card game that fit this time slot (15 or 20/play) and I love area control. But I'm blown away by the gameplay of it. I really like playing 1v1 abstracts with my partner and this fits right in with that and scales up really well for multiple players. Plus the "theme" is funny and you end up saying things like "I'm taking over your fire pandas." 

This is one of the few games I'd describe as "exciting" too. Some others would be Campy Creatures, Niagara, or Pitcrew.

RATING: 7
A great little hand management area control game. The cards give a ladder feel as you don't want to play the first of a type, but you want to get as many cards down as possible to control the area. An excellent filler in that there is much more than presented. Easy to approach and very unique.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Basic area control game using cards. Not too bad, but it's very easy to steal whole areas, although there are ways to protect at least a few cards and it doesn't happen as often as I feared. Anyway, the stealing can make the game very swingy. Luck of the draw plays a huge part, as a lot may depend on having the right card at the right time. I've seen people praise the overly stylized artwork, but it's too crude for my taste.

First board game I ever kickstarted, and it was a pleasant experience overall. The game was good, but could have used a bit of polish. The art was gorgeous, but with no iconography on the special cards it was difficult to remember what cards did. Also, due to the size of the cards, the game ended up taking up more space than it really needed to. This would have been better as a tile laying game than a card game. Not bad, but ended up selling it to make room for other fare.

* Kickstarted! *

Take control of cards by building series and using special cards -- it's the old game of Othello but done with more visually appealing cards and more than two players. There is strategy, good need to remain focused, and enough variants in the special cards to encourage repeated plays.

PLUS: visually interesting, nice variants
MINUS: the base play is rather simple at its core

I love this game (SO does too, so that's a bonus) and definitely appreciate the different levels of play. From a quick and easy 5 minute game with the base deck to the hour long all extra cards included version, there's a lot of replay value. The only downside is managing the cards is a bit annoying. You pretty much have the sort the cards every time you play because it depends on the number of plays and which level you play. Still... I really look forward to coming back to this again and again.

2nd Edition:
Beautiful art. Easy to teach/learn. Quick to play. Great introduction for new players to area control mechanics. High replayability, even without all the special cards. Small quibble: the cubes were low quality, some not cut right or split and misshapen. But they get the job done. Sometimes it may feel like you are picking on another player (possibly the one trailing behind), but it is just a case of luck-of-the-draw... ie. one player keeps playing the only cards you can play on for maximum benefit. Which can make it hard to go after your closest competitor(s) if it isn't them who are setting you up with good plays. So yes, there is some luck but again it plays quickly so not a big deal at all. I think there is a good amount of decision making (strategy & tactics) and depth to be found here. Not just superficially, which I believe most of the negative reviews focus on. They play it once, likely get their butt handed to them, rate Vye poorly, and go off to play some different area-control game that takes 6 hours to play. Which apparently they consider to be a better experience? Don't get me wrong, this isn't going to satisfy the hardcore area-control buff, by itself, forever. But I'd propose, for the time investment, and larger available audience, Vye is hard to beat for the type of game it is.

Update:  June 2015

TL;DR  Light tactical area control card game, with beautiful art work and a short playing time (15-30 min).  A game that deserves a wider audience.

Have now played the KS release edition of the game with the new special cards.  Not fond of the Fortress, but the other special cards are interesting.  Definitely adds to the chaos, but I think the special card effects are manageable and given that Vye is a lighter game that plays quickly, I don`t mind so much.

The game does scale up to 5 players, but I much prefer 3p or 4p since the game is already quite chaotic and luck of the draw is important.  Like the game enough that I`m now thinking about purchasing or trading for a copy.  Would really like to see Vye gain wider distribution and the appreciation of gamers everywhere.

The KS backer names on the cards are printed in small, light coloured blue font, so I don`t think the names detract from the card aesthetics at all.  Really a non-factor imo.

----------------------------------------------------------

Rating based on play of nicely produced PnP copy (preliminary release version) at a local Meetup.

Area control card game with a manageable amount of chaos (maybe), playable in 15 minutes.  When playing the basic game without the special cards, the rules recommend you play a series of three games to average out luck.  Play can be quite tactical.  Good filler game and very accessible.

Really excellent art work and looking forward to the retail edition with extra cards (and no KS backer names on the cards!).

The art is AMAZING. Really great. The card play is a bit dry. It is all about who can have the most connected cubes at the end. If you play a card directly adjacent to a card with the same art you take control of ALL of that type in the group. (4 cards of each type). You also have 4 special cards that give automatic dominance to the cards where the arrows are pointing. 

For me the game was 75% luck and 25% skill for playing a special card. I had that part down but I wasn't getting the correct matching cards so I was winning then losing a lot. 

I would play again, but I won't request it. 

I REALLY LOVE THE ART! It should be used in more games.

Takes up a ton of table space, even for the basic game. Really should have been tiles instead. Very dependent on luck of the draw, and not allowing diagonal adjacency seemed to hurt it, as it's too easy to block most terrain and require use of a family member in order to get that diagonal back At the very least this should have drawing rules like Ticket to Ride, where you pick one of three or draw one off the top.

I might give it a couple more tries, but even though I really like area control by matching cards conceptually, I feel like it would be better if you could match on two things instead of one (like suit or number if this were playing cards).

Played an intro 5 players game. After setup, about 10 cards remain in the deck. "Strange", we think, but the rules confirm that we are using the correct amount of cards. Game is over after 3 minutes, which is shorter than the explanation was. Never again. Why would I bother when the rules are broken and clearly not playtested. Alternative review: we are idiots and we made a rules mistake. Maybe another time.

Beautiful looking game.  First couple of plays were 2-player with 2 sets of special cards and 1 legendary card.  Easy play, not sure how much depth there is here, but it is enjoyable.  Looking forward to trying with more players and trying all the variants.  

My wife enjoyed it, but had a minor complaint that the cubes were difficult to easily see with the varied colorful background of the cards.  She recommended that we use something like Pente stones in the future so they stand out more clearly when reviewing the large play area.

Time estimates in the rulebook are not very accurate. Game times are much shorter than stated with those number of cards.  Recommend upping the card count.

[PnP] Not bad, but it's better with the expansion (which I don't have).

Simple game, It's enjoyable both from non-gamers and gamers. It has a ton of special cards that make every game different!

Played with Jenna at Mox. Easy to learn, beautiful art, fun gameplay, works awesome at 2-players, and we only played one of multiple game options the cards offer. Jenna bought it right away.

Print and play edition. This is a take-that game of conquering and stealing lands. It works, but ultimately, it's just not that fun. Would I buy it after trying the print and play? No.

 Abstract strategy game. You grow your kingdom by placing Land and Building cards on the table, claiming the cards you place and potentially others around them in the process, easy to learn and can be played in about 20 minutes.

This is a great little filler game.  Its easy to learn and easy to play.  Most games seem to run about 15-30 minutes.  If you like fast simple games to kill a little time then this game is perfect.  If you need hard core strategy and deep thinking games that last several hours....then you might want to go looking at the Fantasy Flight games.

My game group tried the PnP version, and now we can't stop playing!  It is a brilliant game.  Gorgeous artwork, very simple rules, and highly strategic at the same time.  The only negative I see is that the stretch goals have all been achieved!  Even the backer names on the cards are brilliantly integrated because they are barely visible from close up.

Cards are beautiful. Reminds me of "Samurai Jack" art.

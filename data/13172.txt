I enjoy this much more than its beat-em-up cousin Lunch Money, for two reasons. One, the theme is light and fun rather than somewhat guilt-inducing. Two, and more importantly, the cards have useful text describing what they do.
That said, this is a great once-in-a-while filler type game. Teams would be fun to try.

A bit of fun for the "Flying spinning up-the-wall kick" combo stuff. Multiplayer perhaps best when your target for each round is random (like cosmic encounter).

Nice light game where you can put into action all those moves you learned from years of watching movies.  My concern is that this would pale after several repeat playings.  Slows down a lot when down to last two players.  Must be played with the right crowd.

RATING: 7
Nice little game.  I used to play it during lunch all the time, and still play it while waiting for others to show up.  You have to get into the theme to really enjoy throwing an "Invincible, Running up the Wall, Flipping, Wild, Fast, Punch" and send you opponent flying.  Fun, if your in the mood for goofiness.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite a light but fun game to play with a group.  Not something I would want to play all night, but it works as a first or last game of the evening.  I wouldn't play it 2 players, as I like the free for all feel to it.

Pretty simple game.  There is some strategy in what you play and what you discard at the beginning of your turn.  But mostly it comes down to what cards you get.  Some of the attack combos are funny.  Spinning, Flying, Fast, Off the Wall, Invincible, Magnificent Kick!

Have only played 2-player so far. It's fun, though I definitely would like to try with more players: with 2, it's just a back-and-forth fest. After a few plays, the rules make sense - but they are quite tricky despite their short length. Lots of luck, though not entirely luck-based.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Solid little light filler fighting game.  Very stylish, balanced rock-paper-scissor style design, cardflow is the key.  I suspect it would play better with more than just two, but still fun as a 2player filler.  Might just have to start carting it around as a travel game.

I was pretty disappointed that with such an easy theme, the game did almost nothing to inject flavor into the game. No funny quotes, no art to speak of, no hilarious situations. The design was pretty spartan, leaving the pieces feeling pretty blank.

The game itself played okay -- though block cards seem to be a bit too tough. It a very simple game, which is fine for the beer & pretzel type as long as I'm laughing and enjoying the flavor, but that just wasn't there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A fun fighting card game with plenty of "Hong Kong Cinema Style" theme.  One of my friends said it best that the game was like playing a Mortal Kombat style video game.  You come up with countless combinations of attacks that can be fended away.  I like the Stance card and how some were always good against other ones.  A fun short game for the Jackie Chan in all of us.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Another card based combat game, with attacks, attack boosters, blocks, hit point recovery, weapons and "stances" which give bonuses for certain attacks and against some other stances, but are weaker in defence against others.

There's other games like this and at the end of the day, if you have the right defensive cards at the right time then you will win. Plenty of luck, but play it fast and furious without caring who wins really and it's good fun.

Yet another take that game, theme is good, but there is a lot of reading, and becuase you draw cards at the start of your turn the game can drag because you may be reading 7 new cards every turn after you dra.

Not too much going on here, just a wacky slugfest with a bit of hand management. Super fun, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A nice, quick, head-to-head game where you get to yell ridiculous attack names. Very simple mechanics good for a quick bit of fun in-between other things or while you wait for someone.
I would recommend playing this with more than two players, however. With just two it can get a little dull at times.

RATING: 5
What Munchkin should have been: a quick, 30-minute filler that lets you laugh at the card combinations and have fun beating the tar out of each other.  The cards aren't balanced and the winner is determined by luck (drawing the best card combinations and not being picked on by the other players).  It doesn't matter because the game is quick (unlike Munchkin).

Lightweight filler which can take a while to conclude.  It's a bit repetitive and lacks any real strategy, but it's fun to throw a wild, spinning, running up the wall, combination trip-punch at your opponent.

RATING: 4.5
What a great quick little filler!  The theme, the components, it all fits right together. If you garner any enjoyment from Jackie Chan or kung fu cinema....this is a wonderful 5 minute diversion. There is no real hint of strategy. There is a fair amount of negotiation, which basically amounts to bashing the leader...but that's about it. Otherwise its a lot of howling and posing and running up the wall.

RATING: 3
I like the directness of it (attack an opponent, either they block or take damage, the end) and the simple, uncluttered rules are welcome but there's almost nothing to it.  Pretty bland (almost DTP) components.  Might go over well with groups inclined toward fighting games.  Me?  No thanks.

Quick, light game.  Not a ton of strategy, but there is some depth underneath the fun theme.  

It can drag on a bit when there are too many defense cards and too few players, but there's not as much of the "take that!" that slows down other card games.

Unique theme.  I enjoyed getting combos of card to obliterate my opponents. Part strategy, part luck.  Beats all those "go fish" card games I keep getting lately. Great replay value.  Only problem is that when we got down to 2 players left, it was like a really long ping-pong game. Can’t get that song “Kung-Fu Fighting” out of my head now.

RATING: 2
A large multi-player card game that I enjoyed a bit after I first purchased it, but have since become rather bored with. While it is very thematic and interesting from that perspective, the amount of real decision making within the game is not particularly high, and frequently comes down to when and how to use the various blocks and power cards. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Standard take that biffo game.  Players take on the role (and personality!) of a martial arts movie star, target an opponent on their turn, and try to play out a devastating combo of cards (e.g. fast flying kick from the tiger stance).  If the attack can't be blocked, damage is done.  Last one standing wins.  This game actually felt pretty good, rules were solid, components good.  Will happily play it again.

Hahahahhahaha.  I love this little game.  It's frustrating that sometimes the best thing to do is just play small little attacks and not go all out with crazy combos, but I guess that's true to the feel of the genre too.  Plus its easy, fun, and fast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Fun card game with a great theme. We misinterpreted some attacking rules, and ended up playing them differently to help the game along. I feel some time-scaling house rules are in order for this one. We played 4 players and it just dragged out a little too long starting at 20 Chi.

Okay, if you like quick card games and fighting like the Kung Fu moves in the movies, this game is the right fit for you.  Just like the Shaolin Masters, you can take a stance, use weapons, make outrageous flying, jumping, off the wall, leaping kicks and punches, it is there.  Great game that is easy to learn, quick to play and enjoyable all at once.  Maybe it is just what I like in a game, but it is worth a try for all.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
I think my tolerance for games based completely on luck is diminishing, even when the theme is great.  For me, if a game is going to be this light strategy-wise it also has to be fiddle-free, and there's a bit of fiddliness here with the card texts and figuring out couterattacks.

There are much better fillers or 'party' games out there. Also has early player elimination problem.

My eldest son played this at the first LVGG meeting we went to, and he enjoyed it.

It is what it is. Use Stance, Fight, Block, Weapons cards and so on and try to do damage to other players. Obvious stuff, tiny typing, it does have a lot of good martial arts ideas but is more like a manual than a game. Fun enough until you have no attacking cards at all and so can do nothing. Maybe it needs some form of simultaneous actions instead of turn-based play.

I can't see that there's much strategy involved. With 2 players, it's mostly just luck, but I would like to play with more players, maybe even in teams. I do not like games where you can see who the leader is and the only strategy is to pick on them. It's boring.

Fun playing one-on-one and even better multi-player. Being able to discard any number of cards before you draw adds an interesting decision point, as you can either work on building up a pat hand, or toss everything in hopes of drawing a hand full of enhancements to power up an all-out attack. You can also sandbag a little bit if you have a hand of defense cards and counter-attacks ... and then there are weapons and stances which change things up, too. Funny voices and bad accents are a must. Good times.

Games of this type need to succeed in theme AND playability, and Kung Fu does both handsomely.  As opposed to Munchkin Parts 1-30, Pimp: The Backhanding, and Gloom, for example, which are brutally weak in the playability department.  Kung Fu's production value is outstanding.  Gameplay is simple, streamlined and not too fiddly, which is where other games of this ilk always falter.  Theme is funny and fun.  Even the shyest gamer will get into the spirit. A terrific "gateway" game and family game.

RATING: 7
Like most card-based fighting games, this one is heavily dependant on luck-of-the-draw. But it's still a lot of fun, especially the mechanism of changing stances to fit the cards in your hand. With many blocking cards in the deck it can be hard to land a decent hit, but that seems to be pretty "authentic" if you judge by the movies. Works equally well with 2 or 4 players, and is fast enough that being eliminated first doesn't ruin your game.

RATING: 6
The more I play, the more I like.
Very heavy luck factor here, but it's always, always a fun game.  It might help that I was a huge kung-fu junkie as a kid, but there's tremendous gratification in watching your opponent anxiously scanning their hand to find an appropriate block for your massive, multi-card-combination beatdown (Flying, Spinning, Off-The-Wall, Invincible-Punch attack in Drunken-Master stance.)

Solo-gaming factor: middling.  If you solo, it's best to play at least three characters.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
It seems to be a pretty luck-based game, particularly when compared to Yomi (which does similar things) - you don't have much influence over when you get to make super strong attacks, and when you'll have blocks of what kind available, you just draw cards and hope for the best.

There is some very limited hand management, stances do introduce some strategy (but won't be available much of the time when you need them) and I see that this could probably work as a party game, but probably not much more than that.

Ah well.

(Haven't played yet, actually, that's merely what I read from the rules.)

**Group dependent on fun factor and laughs**

I grew up on Mountain Dew, Beef Jerky in a can, Totino's Party Pizzas, All Star Wrestling, and Kung Fu Theater. I grew up in the 80's when Ninjas were the thing, where James Bond was a teenage boy's dream job, where Han Solo swaggered and shot first, where Indiana Jones whip cracking wit won the girls and the Golden Monkey.

I grew up dreaming of saving the Last Princes of China, being the last monk off the mountain, being the wayward ronin down on his luck naming himself after flowers and helping down on their luck townfolk, I grew up dreaming of jumping buildings and flying in a single bound--not in pajamas of blue, but silk bathrobes. I dreamed of avening my master, beating back Kung Fu trained apes in rent-a-costume skins.

I shall avenge my master. Finally I can. 

This game is easier to teach than Bang! and is quicker to play. I like it a bit more at the moment, but then the theme leaves the sting of Mt. Dew and Jerky on my throat and I hear the bell of the wrestling ring...and see people talking out of synch with their lips in my inner eye.

I am appreciative of this game because it was the game that got all of my friends into board games, the game that made them think "wow games can be a lot more fun than thought."  On the other hand, now that all of my friends like games, there is no need to play this one anymore.  

lots of fun if in the right group and if hyped up, but otherwise can be frustrating, especially if you are eliminated early on.

I bought this game to play at work. We discuss Ninjas frequently and I figured it would be a great diversion. It is. It's an endless barrage of combos on top of combos. It's truly like a fight scene in a Kung Fu flick.

Visually this game is rather flat. The monotone cards are OK but instead of the elegant feeling the producer was going for it comes across as cheap to me. The play uninspiring, eliminates players and oft times tedious. That said there is worse out there.

This looks like a cool idea, but felt mechanically unbalanced as a two player game. One player drew all these fight cards while the other just drew stances and couldn't defend himself. Not fun.

pro: nice artwork and some silly fun in capturing cinematic kung-fu battles. 
con: It's a no-game for me. No real chance for tactics, nor strategy. Do you have cards to defend? Then do it. You don't? Then you lost some chi. It's all just luck, and it's almost only the game playing itself instead of you but might be moderately fun with kung-fu movie lover buddies.

RATING: 4
The ideas and the theme are interesting but there is something missing. The game does not seems that much appealing. There is also the fact that you can kill somebody in a few rounds but when there was 2 player left and I had only few HP left I hold at least 15 minutes against my opponent by dodging and counter attacking my opponent. The strategy does not seems very deep, that's a problem with this kind of game where it seems that the best strategy is always to play the strongest card in your hand.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Very light, luck driven "take that" card game with a little hand management involved.  I actually like the components (the artwork is pleasantly understated for a game/theme that is not exactly subtle).  This can be fun with the right group.

2.0 - May 2015 - 1 Play:  I don't know if it was the group size, the explanation, or the game, but this game stunk!  It drug on and on and on, and when I was knocked out, I was glad to be able to leave the table.  It might work with only two players, but it's not something I care about finding out.

Fun, quick, lightweight card game.  Great art, entertaining chop-socky dialogue on the cards ("Your Kung Fu is no match for mine!"  "When done right, none can defend").  Great fun if the players get into the absurdist spirit of launching Invincible Flying Spinning Monkey Kicks at each other.

Great themed hand management game. There is some luck in the draw, but it all comes down to managing your cards, and getting rid of some. Its not the prettiest game you've ever seen, but its functional thematic and can be a great deal of fun if the players get into the theme. Requires a few cheesy lines from saturday Kung-fu movies. A lot of the rules are on the cards, so its fairly easy to teach. Scales WONDERFULLY from 2-6.

RATING: 8
Loved this game even if others didn't, the cards are really random but with strategy, you can beat other players most of the time through figuring out how they are going to attack you.  Or if you are about to die which cards will help you to stay alive until everyone else has killed each other off.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
It's a chaotic, take-that card game with a fair amount of randomness.  There is still some strategy, and intelligent cardplay will overcome much of the luck of the draw.  The theme (which I love) is perfectly integrated into the game.

I played this much more frequently with a different gaming group that preferred short, light games.  It doesn't hit the table these days as my usual gaming group leans towards heavier games, as do I.

Fun card game which can work for 2 players but gets more interesting with more due to attacks that can be made to more then one person. The variety of weapons and stance cards which can be played is fun and can help enhance your attacks or your opponents, so be careful!

I think this hits the mark it was aiming for: light, fast, brutal.

I'm not a big fan of card games in general, and nothing about this makes me want to come back to it very often. I would never ask to play this. But if someone asked me to play it as a filler game, I'd be okay with that.

It's got just enough color and action to be entertaining as an occasional diversion.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Too much "I attack" then "I block" and then "I attack again" and then "I block again" in this game to make it anything more than a humorous side diversion. You pretty much attack on your turn and hope no one else has a block card (which they will). It carries its theme well, though.

Quick game, easy to learn.  Best part is the crazy names for the moves.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Played once (that's all you'll ever need).  Played with 5.  It was a hoot actually because we acted out all of our fight cards when we played them. The game though, is barely there at all.  On your turn, you simply choose a player to attack, and then use all of the attack enhancement cards you have in your hand against them (because your hand automatically replenishes after each turn, so why wouldn't you use everything you've got??).  That's it.  That's all you do.  The game also tends to drag because of the chi energy restoration cards which prevent the last few players from dying out.  The only thing it has going for it is the theme.

TRADED

Fun and light filler type game where players take on the role of Kung Fu masters and battle it out until there's only one player standing. If you enjoy the martial arts genre and classic kung fu movies then this card game will probably work for you and your group. Game machanics are very simple and easy to teach. Not much depth but it is quick and exciting. The only down side is elimination of players once they're Chi is reduced to zero.

OUTSTANDING for its type, and superior to nearly everything of its type for the following reasons:

- all the rules important to playing a card are [i]on[/i] the card; very easy for new players to pick up

- almost all cards are [i]modifiers[/i] to the standard rules, [i]not[/i] exclusions; this avoids the traps of Overpowering "broken" effect combinations and Overly confusing effect combos

- hand size and number of options offer enough [i]tactics[/i] to more than overcome the luck factor and lack of overall strategy - a series of small attacks that will take time to wear my opponent(s) down, or one big megadamage wallop that might get blocked and waste my cards? a Stance that gives me an major edge against one opponent, or one that works better with the cards I have in hand now? 

- reflects its theme and source material perfectly in both card art and gameplay: sudden upsets, surprise comebacks, applause-worthy moves were all a part of my first game. Besides who doesn't love the theme?

A game with some really good ideas, but horrendously-written rules, as evidenced by the extensive "Rules" posts on BGG, especially for what is essentially a pretty simple card game. 

But after getting the rules straightened out, I have to say that "Kung Fu Fighting" is fun, especially if people come to it in the spirit it which it was created and really get into the concept. 

At the same time, I imagine many players will have to do their own interpretation of the rules in a way that works for them. Although the idea is fun, somehow the card play doesn't seem to measure up to the concept, but on the other hand, if participants come into play with the proper attitude, it could be quite fun. There are some good ideas about how the cards interact. I really like the artwork on the cards (even though it's not in color) and the variety of attack and defense options. 

Ordered new, October 2010. Sold December 2011.

Well it's nothing but total take-that metagaming. I mean you can call out and take bets on who's going to win and the order of elimination beforehand and be pretty safe about it, taking into account who takes out who most often in your local meta, who's won a lot recently, and the like. But the quick game play and the wonderful theming brings on a lot of fun, so I can forgive it a run out every now and then. Good for a laugh while hamming it up if nothing else, and there's room for that.

I played this game with its creators at DunDraCon 2006.  While I really wanted to like this game, I was put off by the seemingly all-powerful "block" card that consistently foiled the best laid multi-card attack.  I think the game has potential with some house rule variations that limit the blocking power.

Fun, very light game for two players. I think this game is best with two players or team play. Its the kind of game to play when you are in the mood for something light and amusing. Definitely get the expansion, it makes the game more interesting and adds much needed variety.

Why I purchased: Attempting to find Duell
Where purchased: FLGS

This was one of the first games I bought as I got back into gaming. The session reports made it sound fun.

My daughter flew off the wall and kicked me in the face to win. Trading this now.

A nice light filler. Only played with two, but I can image it getting a little hectic with more people. The only issue I really have is that it can quickly turn one-sided depending on the draws, but that's the same with any card drawing game.

Ok game to play.  Not a whole lot of strategy.  Just luck of the draw but it's fun to kick your friends in the face, or break of chair over their back.

YOU THINK YOU'RE PRETTY GOOD, EH
Another purchase my wife can blame on my love of Hong Kong cinema.  Just like the movies fun, fast and fairly brainless.  If you like gaming and enjoy badly dubbed (as if there was any other kind) kung fu movies, this game is for you.  The rules are confusing at first blush but it all comes together when you start playing.  The kids LOVE it!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Silly game with a great theme!  Be sure to use the all-important house rule that you must recite the title of every card you play.  (Preferably with a cheesy movie accent.)

Easy to learn and play - even non-gamers love it. A good card game with a great thematic execution.  Each turn you can attack one opponent with a kung fu move.  The twist is that you can throw on modifiers to make your attack look like something out of a wuxia movie.  Your opponent must then either block or take damage.

RATING: 5
Once the 'fun' of making strange chop sockey poses and yelling of 'hee-yahs' die down, this game shows itself to be have weak kung fu.

Why? The 'take that' mechanisms I can handle, but the game is draggy and there is invariably alot of time spent trying to resolve staking of attacks, defences and damage values. And once you get down to two players, he who has the best cards wins.

The cards are uncoated and will not wear well at all.

RATING: 7
Works better as a Two player - It is a LOT of fun.  Discarding at the start of your turn allows you to 'work' the preferred stance of your choice.

I may buy another ($15 at Boulder) for my son so he can take it to school to play during his breaks.  I won't let him take mine.

I was pleasantly surprised with this. A balanced, interesting take-that game that succeeds where so many others have failed. The card mix is pretty good, so that you typically have some options on your turn, and unlike many other take-that games, defense plays a big part here. Another bonus is this plays very well with two players, where most slugfest games are terrible as a two-player affair.

A fun, quick combat card game that's perfect when you're in a not too serious mood.  To keep all the players in the game as long as possible, and to avoid all players ganging up on one player, we use a house rule that you have to attack the player with the most Chi, we also play that it's dishonorable to attack a player in the same stance as you (i.e. you can't attack them) unless there are only 2 players left.

It's not unbearable, but it's 90% luck. The humor is lackluster. With 5-6 players it is prone to early player elimination and long waiting times.

Great non-CCG card game where the only luck is the luck of the draw.  Even this is mitigated by the "discard at start of turn rule".  A good hand management game where you will face tough decisions on what to play and what to save for defense.  More strategy is available with fewer players, but it plays up to 6 and you can even play as teams.  Super theme, easy to learn and fun to play.  Nice components include player mats for scoring and tracking your stance and/or weapon of choice.

The only fun aspect of this game is emphatically stating the names of the extended attacks (e.g., "predestined, lackadaisical, animal-friendly roundhouse!").

Every time that I'm forced to play, I wind up intentionally not playing my block cards just to push the game closer to ending.

I'll give this game credit for being pretty thematic and decently fun. I'm just not personally into the all against each other, elimination type of game. I wish it played a bit faster so the elimination part wasn't such a big deal. We played with 3, but apparently it's best with 4...I would've guessed 5 or 6.

(Trade Interest: medium) evokes the mood of a good kung fu brawl... but there seems to be a balance problem.  i played four straight games and never won once, trying various strategies.  i just never got the card comboes i needed, and almost always ran up against the exact block to counter my attacks.  this was against my GF, who is by no means an expert ccg player.  might play again with more people.

Not really my type of game, but it's more fair than, say, [thing=258]Fluxx[/thing], in that you at least can't stumble into victory, as seems to happen at least 30% of the time in [thing=258]Fluxx[/thing].  With Kung Fu Fighting, you must survive and work your way toward victory.  As a group game, if one person is ganged up on, that person will lose.

Plays great with 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

The Chop Socky theme is spot on. Anyone interested in badly dubbed martial arts films will feel instantly at home.

Nigh on impossible to play without at least one sound effect or attempt at a Fu style pose.

Lots of possibilities for massive attack combo's, blocking, bluffing, counter attacking, and foolishly leaving yourself cardless and at the mercy of the other players fists, feet, tables etc.

Your Kung-Fu is weak. Try my Spinning, Flying, Nunchaku Attack!!! Hup, hai, huo

I think this is a great filler game, with some really tense decisions. I'm very glad I picked it up in Essen.

A cute and seldomly seen idea given a lovely and evocative physical execution... but unfortunately with little game to make it stand out. Perhaps it has to do with the title's zero sum nature, and perhaps it has to do with the ease with which one gathers VP cards: it only takes 'reinforcement' on an already victorious position to capture the VPs. Given a normal card draw it is nearly impossible to end a round without having gathered VP. Without the special action cards a dull and repetive whole remains. Perhaps that with them there is a bit of asymmetry which causes the split of the card draw to become more challenging... but frankly, I doubt it will ever reach the lofty levels of the smooth as butter San Marco (which works surprisingly well at 2).

Very fun 2 player  " tug of war"  game.  Has some neat rule and mechanic twists. I wish this game was more well known and easier to get in the USA.

Fact or Fiction, the game. It's decent, but there is downtime (when waiting for the opponent to split and waiting for the opponent to select) which is somewhat depressing for a two-player game.

This game looks really silly but it's actually pretty good. A you-split-I-choose-game that works well with 2 is something I'll always enjoy.

ケーキの切り分け+バトルライン。
各列において優勢であればカードを配置せずそれを得点化できるというのが肝で、最終的に列を制するかどうかはさほど重要ではない。これにより場面場面の悩ましさがあり、終盤は列の支配も意識するといういい塩梅のゲームになっている。特殊カードを入れた方が楽しい。

Bought it at Essen, and love it. Quite a bit of strategy in such a little game. Travels well ;)

This is a nice filler.  And it's pirate themed!!  A very pure "I split, you choose" game.  Trying to get majorities to control 4 different pirate ships.  Controlling pirate ships then lets you put points in your treasure chest for end game scoring.  Nice art on the cards.  A fun game that's done in 20 minutes!

It's splitting cards like in San Marco or Shitenno and creating majorities. So nothing really new, but the mechanisms are implemented very well and they work especially well for 2 players which ain't that obvious. So fun, quite light game!

Great filler for 2 person.
Simple, fun, quick(just 8 rounds - can be played within 15 minutes) but still requires some hard decisions.

Good 2 player game.
Main mechanism is card split, like in [gameid=37371].

High luck of the draw prevents a higher rating

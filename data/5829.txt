One of my favourites from Europa system despite being a fairly tedious affair.If only Mussolini had had this game in 1940 he would not have attacked. The Greeks are suprisingly tough and garishly orange. Trying to get the Yugoslavians to join the Axis at least once to see what happens. Germans have fun in their usual Teutonic way crushing everything when they arrive.

My Greek friend proved a capable Italian leader as he headed headlong into the cold, stark Illyrian mountains towards Greece and um stopped. 
After turn 2 his air forces had been stopped and the greeks fought tenaciously to stop and push the Italians back.

One of the few wargames about Balkan war...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
With the update counters and "WavellÂ´s War" rules!
 Italo-Greek war scenario, is killed by the weather rules, almost mud every turn. Impossible to make the same progress as the GreekÂ´s did.
 The other scenarios works better.
There is a fun scenario where Italy, Hungary & Bulgaria gangs up against a pretty tough Jugoslavia!

But with the worthless experience of the "Italo-Greek" scenario the rating drops from a 8 to a 6!

Have the first printing of this in the thin box and light-colored German and Italian counters. Later picked up the replacement counters for those and they were of the type initially released in First to Fight (2-ply cheap cardboard).

Need to order the refit kit.

I really enjoy this game....the Italo Greek is my favorite scenario....I for one think the Europa series air rules are pretty good....For me they are evocative....has it's flaws to be sure....I do think leaving out the Yugoslavian "unit" surrender rules as found in Merita Merkur was a mistake....

Get it...play it....that's my "recy" for what it's worth...

Own this, with Refit Counters & Wavell's War rules, but yet to play.  Loved Marita-Merkur (GDW) though ... it had the Aussie breakdown units, alas BF does not!  Was also the 2nd Europa game my son (then 8) "helped" me play ... rolling dice and moving counters.

I should try another play with the refit kit included in Wavell's war.
But even like this, I had a lot of fun.

Dated system I know but love the europa system but difficult to find anyone in the known universe willing to play it-Balkan Front nice bite sized module that gets you into the system quickly and each game is usually rewarding

This first 1990 release of the Europa "Collector Series" was released with faded color printed countersheets, some misaligned. A counter reprint sold in 2005, with the purchase of the Europa game Wavell's War is a huge improvement. Either way, the game challenges are enjoyable with easy to follow rules that once learned, need not be learned again as you play other games in this delightful series.

A good simulation of the Italian invasion of Greece and the subsequent German intervention in the Balkan.

For the Italian is a desperate attempt while for the German is a race against the time.

I like The Europa series because it simulates the major campaigns of WWII with a good level of detail regarding the Orders of Battle, but on an area of play affordable.

An okay game in the Europa series. Models all campaigns of the Axis operations to take Yugoslavia, Greece and Crete well except for the border fighting for Albania. This game struggles to model the extensive Greek incursion into Albania, with excessive negative combat mods for weather and mountainous terrain just drying up options for the Greeks. However besides this small part of the campaign, has many excellent scenarios and many variants.

I have this with the Wavell's war rules and upgrade kit. These I think overcome some of the problems with the weather preventing any sort of winter offensive - the Greeks now regain the mountain advanatages they had in Marita Merkur. On the Wavell's War map insert the weather line has also moved north by the coast, allowing for a shorter (but muddier) winter out of the main mountain area. On my first play so far, the Italians managed to penetrate a long way down the Adriatic coast and even beat the Germans to Athens.

I enjoy Europa (especially the older titles) but this particular title isn’t one of the better ones. With the prohibitive terrain, this resembles more of a rugby scrum than it does a campaign. It is worth playing a time or two and it can be completed in an evening, it’s just not very interesting.

Tolerable for Europa, but still bad.  This one for me is probably the best overall module...although I wonder if I wouldn't have liked Merita-Merkur better.

RATING: 7
This game would be a 9 if it weren't for the fact that most of the people I have played it against are completely unwilling to attack as either side & spend the entire game waiting for the German invasion in April. Consensus is that that's the historical reality but in this case consensus is bull - both the Italians & Greeks attacked - a lot. In 1940 the Italians thought that they could reach Salonika & the Greeks thought they could too. That possibility doesn't even enter the head in this game. Marita-Merkur was superior in this respect as the early border fighting was a kill-fest. On all other counts this game is a beauty though.

The original GRD game became obsolete with the new counters from the Balkan Front Refit or Wavell's War. Using the new counters, the game is one of best ones to introduce to Europa Series.

Loved the idea of Europa but they kept tweaking the games so you could never truly combine them.

Then again never could get folks to play them as individual games so doubt the Grand Europa game would of ever worked out.

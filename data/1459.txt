Another damn Yahtzee variant.  This one has the players work on a communal set of combos.  You can partially complete combos and your opponents can finish them and steal the points.  Fun, but felt perhaps uneven in some way.

A fun dice roller.  Plays pretty quickly.  Some small strategy, but largely just dice rolling.  I can live with this one.  Fun, short, easy.  The dice-rolling tray is awesome.

Excellent dice game, maybe too random with more than 4 players.  The only two multi-player dice games I like more are Can't Stop and Exxtra.

RATING: 5
In [thing=1459][/thing] you try to co-operatively build Yahtzee-like patterns with your dice but only the person contributing the last die (thus finished the pattern) will receive the points (which may be negative as well).
On your turn you can roll up to 3 times and must then put down at least one die.

I'm not really a fan of such dice-heavy games and my rating certainly reflects that. If I have to play a dice-based I rather play [thing=117959][/thing] which I oddly enough enjoy quite a bit.

Found this at a thrift store and picked it up for the ton of dice I was going to rescue.  Was surprised to find a fairly fun game inside.  We play it occasionally with our party game group.  If people eventually tire of it, I still have the dice!  [Thrift $1.09]

What a great copy of Sharp Shooters!  Opened, but unplayed.  The cards are unpunched, the chips all in factory sealed bags, all 32 dice, and a rule set in excellent shape.  Box shows some very minor shelf wear, but essentially what you're getting is a brand new game here.

RATING: 8
The best dice-rolling/push-your-luck game I've found so far. The reasons why is because everyone's individual roll affects the whole group. This keeps everyone included when it's not their turn and introduces more difficult decisions on whether to keep going or not.

For a random dice rolling game, it's not too bad. Way better than Yahtzee. I'd put it up there with Yahtzee Free For All.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Any game that comes with 36 dice can't be too bad, right? Well, Sharp Shooters is fun, fun, fun. Roll your dice and put them on the randomly selected boards to try to complete full houses, runs of 5's, etc. Be the player to finish a row and get poker chips of different amounts. But, don't finish certain rows on certain cards, or you lose chips. Great replayability and great components make this a very good game. And I've seen it in thrift stores for cheap!

Played a few times with family.  Everyone tends to enjoy it.  We used to play a lot of yahtzee as a family growing up and this has sort of replaced that.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A great dice-fest.  The integration of strategy is actually suprisingly good.  You have to manage your dice carefully, know when to push your luck, and strategically place your dice.  There's opportunities to set up your opponents for a fall, but it's not really targeted to a specific person, so you won't get hurt feelings.  The strategy is in knowing when to save your dice and when to let them roll.

Obviously there's a heavy dose of luck in the game because of all the die rolls, but there are many ways to manage that luck.  We generally find ourselves hooting and hollering as one person's luck turns for the better or worse.  There is a chance that you could have a runaway leader problem, but otherwise this game is a real gem for anyone who enjoys dice-heavy games.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Very light game that is good for kids and times when you just don't want to think too much.  It's just rolling dice and taking some gambles on if you can get what you need.

RATING: 7.5
With 2-players, this game actually has some skill, deciding just how many dice to try and fill in on the big 6-dice 100 pointer to not let your opponent get it too easily but give you a chance next turn.

3-player and beyond, it turns into a pure push your luck, what can I do this turn sort of game.  Which is still fun, but in the end, lowered my rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Hmmm...mindless, but better than Yahtzee.  Not nearly as good as Can't Stop, because the points you earn are never at risk.  The push your luck mechanic is simply about avoiding setting up the other guy for easy scores.

So many dice! A tremendous improvement over Yahtzee. You need to balance your chances of filling a hand versus leaving an easy fill for the next guy. You have to take into account how many dice you have left, as well as how many dice the others have.  Fun to play.

A cousin of Yahtzee/Kniffel, which however doesn't really feel like a true gambling/betting game to me. I'd rather play something more interesting such as Royal Turf instead, which has more interesting decisions and an actual theme, but with comparable playtime.

RATING: 8
It feels like a game of timing. Ideally, every die placed will get you points, but since that's not going to happen, you want your non-point getting dice placements to not really help your neighbour all that much, or you want them to set you up to get points this turn.

But, once you're doing that, there really isn't all that much to think about.

RATING: 6
Its a great quick filler, but the decisions are not nearly as exciting as Liars Dice. I think if I'm in the mood for a quick dice-tossing filler, I'm always going to prefer Liars Dice. I enjoyed playing Sharp Shooter, but its possible to not really have anything to do on your turn for an entire hand (like Poker, eh?). You could toss your dice, get nothing but junk and then watch others get the rewards before you get another turn. 

The reason I prefer Liars Dice is that you have that opportunity to bluff. You ALWAYS have to make an interesting decision when it comes to you...plus the tension rises as the game progresses. Sharp Shooters did have a couple exciting moments, but it was just the result of luck rather than a skillful bluff. There is a little bit of a press your luck element, but its hampered by the format.

Still, I'd happily play again if someone wanted to.

RATING: 6.25
Not unlike Cafe International, this is a game where you have to weigh the risk of opening up points for your opponents when you decide to lay down some of your dice on various scoring opportunities.  You figure, "I've got 3 dice left to roll - OF COURSE I'll get that four and score a bunch of points."  But are you really that lucky?

And that's the only downside to this game really - it's very luck-based.  If you're having bad luck that day, the dice can't help you no matter what you do.

RATING: 6
A reasonably fun evening ender based on a push-your-luck dice-rolling design. You're trying to build poker hands with the dice you roll to get payouts. Thing is, everybody's dice go onto a main board such that you may contribute 4 of the 5 dice to the full house but another player completes that last die and gets the payout. Everybody chants, "C'mon. Set me up!" to goad you into continuing to roll and place dice on the big board such that they are well positioned to finish stuff when it's their turn. Fortunately, after you complete the big board, you start over on a new one so you have a chance to come back if you aren't doing well. Playing several of these big boards constitutes a game and gives the dice a chance to even out.

The game plays quickly and encourages a lot of shouting as dice games frequently do. I think I prefer Tumbling Dice for the sheer tension that one creates, but I'd play this one again.

One of the better dice games I have played.

The Good: Quite a bit of laughter, and some tense rolls. Quick to learn but yet some strategy involved. Games are fairly short, but the game is easily tailored to any length by agreeing to stop with after fewer score cards are played. Unlike some dice games, the scoring changes each turn.

The Bad: Not a heavy strategy game, but it is not meant to be. Winning can be influenced quite a bit on who sits to your right. This is because the person before you can easily leave you an easy big score.

Hmm.

I'm looking for a can't stop killer . 

I like it that if you place a lot of your dice early on you can find yourself rolling with fewer dice. (Which can be a good thing)

However I don't think any game can dethrone Can't stop as the best push your luck game. Well besides russian roulette that is.

I am not much into dice games but this one is very easy to teach to kids and older people who are not familiar with the newer games out these days.  It has been a hit everywhere I have taken it.  There is the roll of the die for the luck factor, but there is strategy involved in placing your points.

This is a light, Yahtzee-like game. It's an ideal one to pull off the shelf after you have been playing serious games for hours and you can't use your brain anymore, but you just want to play one more game before you finally give up and go to the bed.

The only decision you take is to roll the dice (trying to score) or keep them for later (hoping for a better opportunity), but in the end is still only luck that determines the outcome.

A press-your luck Yahtzee style type of game with changing scoring conditions.  I found it frustrating in that I never seemed to be as "set up" as some of my other competitors were.  The players to your right can really narrow or expand your scoring options.  All in all it was pretty fun... a good light-weight game that could be quickly explained to non-gamers.  I played with 5 or 6 people and have been told that there's more decisions with less people.

Previously owned the large-box Sharp Shooters which was a thrift store find.  Kept the dice and chips, threw away the tray and box (damaged).

So... recently picked up Royal Casino which is a revamped Sharp Shooters.  Quality is not up to original release - cheaper, lighter dice, no tray and (sigh) one-sided cardboard chips.... oh well.

As for the game itself, it is a very decent dice-rolling push-your-luck game which I enjoy.  Not to the same level that I enjoy Can't Stop or Pickomino, but a solid game regardless.

If you love dice, then you'll love this game.  While not being too deep, it does have some strategy to it.  There's a push-your-luck element, and a lot of the fun in playing this game is in coercing the other players to take another roll.  One thing that I thought was funny was that the age listed is 12-Adult, but my 8 year old loves this game!

I've been looking for an exciting dice rolling game that actually had some decisions without the downtime that most gamers dice games suffer from.  So far this is the best I've found of its kind (yeah, I like it a little more than Can't Stop).  Really this is a fun push your luck game that uses your dice as resources.  You need to be spendthrift with your commodities.  I do have to say that I didn't enjoy this as much with 6 players as the game eliminates your reserve dice.  Without the back up dice your options are more limited, and your decisions change for the worse (I think).  Also with less players and the reserve dice there is more tension in how you leave yourself for the next time around, whereas with 6 the tension is diffused as the board fills too quickly and players just roll what they get and see what they can do with it.

Mindless dice-fest that is perfect for the last game of the evening (especially after some heavy strategy games).  Works really well at 2-3 in the morning when everyone is tired and a little slap-happy.  Just enough strategy so it's not totally reliant on luck...barely.

There's a ton of luck, but it's not completely free of strategy. It plays very quickly, so this works well as a filler.

The kid loves this one. He likes to take a handful of dice, throw them, then match up the dice to the cards. He does great for a three year old, even to the point of recognizing good and bad plays some of the time.

*EDIT* Now the three year old is a five year old and chooses good moves almost every time.

[MB 94 edition] {Beer&Pretzels; dice-rolling; optimal 4p} SS is a tactical dice game. It's more interactive than other dice-rolling games and each turn is usually short. Wisely placing dice is important to avoid setting up potential lines for the following players. Besides, wisely quitting is also important to save dice for later rolls.

The components are attractive to me and they are very handy. 32 dice are good for many games.

MB 1994.  Thrift store, box is scuffed but contents in great condition.  We had some laughs while playing.  There seems to be some moderately interesting game play, but I don't yet know if it would hold up.  If not, there are plenty of dice to salvage.

It's Yahtzee...but soooo much more.

Yahtzee is dice solitaire. But in Sharp Shooters everyone's rolls are shared to complete the required sets. This is a really fun game of dice odds, turn management, and push your luck, with just a touch of take-that to top it off.

A nice variant on Yahtzee.  I was given this game and didn't play it for a number of years because I thought it was a casino game (that's the theming of the box & game).  It's not really a casino game at all...  Fast, fun, and different.

The production values of the dice tray make me wish a better game had been hung around it.  Heck, Games Magazine even voted it game of the year! (Whatever THAT'S worth.) Sharp Shooters is really very simple and that makes it an okay warm-up.

This was a surprisingly good push-your-luck dice game, in the same vein as Can't Stop.  It worked pretty well with 5 players and had a little more depth than it seemed with some interesting decisions to make.  I'm not sure it's a game I actually need to own, but I won't turn it down as it seems like a good choice for certain circumstances/groups that call for a light/fun dice game.

A easy to learn strategy game with loads of dice. Different strategies can be developed to manage this game. The score distribution is fair. There is luck which does not outweight the game. It's tactical in a 2P or 3P game. It requires more skills at risk management in a 5-6 players game.

This is a good game for two or for a larger group, although 2 to 4 is best.  It is basically a dice fest, but positioning yourself to make a big score can take some planning.  I've got the Milton Bradley version and enjoy the casino feel that it lends by having a dicing table and poker chips.

This is a better game than I would have expected.  Part of the game can come down to the luck of the draw, but how you choose to place your dice on the card can determine how much the dice determine your game.  With more players, though, odds tend to go for those who play earlier in the round, and there's a frustrating point in the game where some rows are full enough to risk going for completing them, while they aren't full enough to give you good odds.  Sometimes you're completing too many rows for other players, which can be detrimental.  Still, it wasn't bad.

I bought this at a thrift store because it came with a bucket of dice and a nice rolling tray. Surprisingly, I found it to be a pretty entertaining push your luck game. It's similiar to Yahtzee, except everyone plays to a common board. It's not tremendously deep...but it plays great in a mixed crowd of kids and adults.

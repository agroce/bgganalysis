GAME: Mafia de Cuba
RANK: 1255

RATING: 6
OK, so let's talk social deduction. This is not my favorite genre, not by a long shot, but as a game night host, I recognize how valuable it can be. Hidden roles games are casual, easy to get going in, and offer a lot of delicious player interaction. 

In Mafia de Cuba, you get to [i]choose[/i] your role, rather than having it randomly assigned to you. It's an interesting twist on the basic Werewolf roles that have been old and stale for twenty years. And Mafia de Cuba does strike up a good conversation at the table. 

But I'm getting rid of this one -- I'm sorry, I just can't do it. I just don't like hidden roles games enough. Despite their value, I just don't feel the need to keep them in my collection. And hey, we've gotten twenty plays out of this one, so it's not like I didn't give it a chance.

I'm also taking a hard look at [thing=156129][/thing] as a possible replacement. Sure, we're still talking murder here, but at least Deception offers more sheer accessibility than Mafia de Cuba. I'm also hanging on to [thing=134352][/thing], because the ability to play a game with more than a dozen people is valuable at times.

Jogo de dedução mista (lógica e social) que respeita o clima dos participantes - não exigindo que ele faça um papel que não quer. Nesse sentido é um "Resistance light". O problema é que a mecânica não é muito lapidada (não existe número máximo de perguntas na fase de interrogatório, por exemplo) e a boa parte da diversão vai depender da interpretação dos papéis e da animação do grupo com quem você jogar.

LIKE: Using the box for the game is unique.
DISLIKE: Role, lying game. Not really my thing. It also takes a while to play.

OVERALL: Interesting. I don't think all the roles work that great: the urchin and driver are not an easy role to play. Difficult game, very random.

Just another flimsy social deduction game... which (again) is not a kind of game I usually like.

Sure the components are really high quality, the artwork is pretty good and the mechanic of picking stuff from a box is fresh... but other than that the game is simply non existent. There's just no real way to read the other players and there's no way to back up your bluff. 

So the game ends up being basically an awkward conversation, where the players just accuse each other of being a liar... and, while this could be fun for some people, it's really not fun for me. Awful game!

Underwhelmed. Some roles are disproportionally more interesting, starting with the mafia boss and decreasing with seating order.

One night ultimate wherewolf is both faster and balanced in terms of player agency balance.

A social deduction game with some bluffing, what makes this unique is chance to try to figure out when people are lying based on the contents of the box.  The components are pretty cool.  I recommend adding some extra garbage in there so that the box will never be truly empty.

RATING: 7
Mafia de Cuba is fast becoming my go-to replacement for The Resistance as for me is scratches a similar itch (hidden roles, deduction and deception) while offering the players more variety and information than vanilla Resistance. As a result, I am going to compare the two games.

In Mafia de Cuba, players are free to choose a role token instead of taking any diamonds. This means that if you want to be Loyal (akin to a Resistance Member) you can be or if you want to push your luck you can be a Thief or one of the Undercover Agents. It's entirely possible in The Resistance (and has happened to me on occasion) that a player can be dealt the same team card (Spy or Resistance) again and again. This can get quite draining and repetitive for the players so I much prefer the choice that Mafia de Cuba offers. It is possible that if all the roles are taken early on you won't get any other choice than to steal some diamonds but the game tries to shake this up by encouraging the players to switch seats and also change who the next Godfather will be so it's not just being passed to a players left each time.

Also, more information is available to the players as at least one of them taking on the role of a Loyal Henchman is telling the truth as it is against their interest to lie to the Godfather. If the Godfather can figure out who the Loyal Henchman is/are then they can deduce who else is lying about what was in the box when they received it. As a result, I find that players have a better time as they have more information to work with instead of baseless accusations and protestations as with the Resistance. 

I know that the two games are not the same but as far as large group social deduction games go Mafia de Cuba is now my preferred game for that purpose.

RATING: N/A
It's pretty hard to get it to the table for me. The game doesn't have enough meat to play it with "gamers" but it asks too much for very casual players with little to no return.

As an idea, I like it. As a game, it's pretty lackluster. I wish it would be more interesting for the roles who aren't the godfather.

Provisionally low. I like the game, but it needs some plays to get the group into the right mindset. Some of the tricks and such aren't apparent, so it seemed pretty easy for the Godfather to start. And the biggest selling point of the game (for me) - that you get to choose your role - isn't 100% true. The first player gets to choose their role, and from there, the choices dwindle.

Party Game à la Weerwolven.
Je kiest (ifv wat er nog in het doosje zit) een rol als handlanger, FBI of chauffeur, ofwel steel je diamamten.
De Peetvader mag vragen stellen, en je mag correct antwoorden, liegen of zwijgen.
Je mag ook spreken zonder dat je iets gevraagd wordt.
Als handlanger win je als de peetvader wint.

Je moet goed kunnen liegen, en dat is dus mijn ding niet.
Als Peetvader moet je wel wat acteer- en deductiekunsten hebben.  Als medespeler moet je dan weer veel overtuigingskracht hebben.

Is gewoon mijn genre spel niet, en daarom de lage score.
Bovendien toch wel wat simpel ook... zowel qua regels als qua materiaal.

Quick Rules:
Mafia de Cuba is a hidden role/social deduction game. In it a player plays a mafia Don hiding all of their diamonds in a cigar box. They at this point remove between 0 to 5 diamonds from the starting amount of 15 that are in box to give them a little piece of information not everyone knows. For some reason the Don is called away and their box is passed from lieutenant to lieutenant. When each player receives the box they take either diamonds(in any amount they see fit) or a single role chip, defining their role in the game. White chips are loyal to the Don and win if they win. Green chips are a wild card who win if the person to their right wins. Blue chips are FBI agents and win if the Don accuses them of stealing diamonds and gets to bust the mafia ring. When the box gets back to the Don, some of the diamonds are missing and they then need to ask questions to try to deduce who stole his diamonds. When the Don asks "Do you have my diamonds?" a player must either give the Don the diamonds stole or show what role they were. If the Don wrongfully accuses someone, depending on the player count, and as long as they didn't guess the FBI agent, the Don might have second tries (tequila bottles) to hand to unhappy lieutenants that allow the game to continue. The game goes on until the guesses are exhausted, the diamonds are all found or the FBI is guessed. Wow, that was a long explanation for a simple game.
--------------------------------------------------------
I actually really like this game. It can get bogged down at huge player counts where it seems that by the time the box gets to you there is nothing for you to do. Or if you are early on in the line you'll have forgot what was in the box by the time it got to you. Really, if you are at double digit player counts you should probably be splitting off into different games. 

It's really a neat social deduction game that lets the player dictate who they want to be in the game. It's got fun components, normally quick gameplay, and always has a funny moment in the questioning. In one game on Tabletop day I broke down Kuhrusty's son, making him give me my diamonds without asking a question, just staring at him and pointing at my eyes then pointing at him for an awkwardly long amount of time. It's well worth it's cost, as it's a fairly cheap game anyway.

*Another personal gripe- This game can be broken by one idiot trying to game the game. In a large group(10-12) at HSU I attempted to teach this and a person who was like the fourth person down the line from the Don received the box with no diamonds and decided to shake the box loudly before taking their chip to show to everyone that there were no diamonds in it. He wasn't one of the new players, so you can't fault my teaching here. An argument ensued with him claiming it's not against the rules(it is) and me replying that no board game rules tell me I can't throat punch him, but I still refrain from it for some reason. (This is the same guy from my The Game, This Town Ain't Big Enough, and Spyfall comments... pretty much all ruined games.)

Very short and quite random bluffing game, the rules take longer to explain than the game takes to play. Occasional fun.

RATING: 4
A poor attempt at making a deduction game, Mafia de Cuba feels like a contrived boardgame version of the «Soldier’s smack» (or «Schiaffo del soldato», an ancient game where the main player has no real information to base his guessing on: sadly I can't find how it actually translates to English) rather than a proper game.

The few components it comes with are very nice though.

Glad to have tried it, and it is innovative, but not something that I think is a very good game.  I thought it was fun, but probably too light on any type of actual decisions to stay interesting for long.

RATING: 7
Social deduction game where you can pick your role. Relies heavily on player interaction, so if your group is playing close to the vest, the boss may have to rely on pure guesswork to make accusations, but has been a overall hit with us.

Great game, but the difficulty with it lies in whether the Don controls the table and knows how to manipulate the information.

So far, it also seems to need a meta score to weigh against playing for good-guy tokens early (as is implemented in Dead Last, with its gold cards).

Quick deduction game. While it wasnt's a terrible experience, it felt like something was missing. There's quite some downtime while everyone waits to grab something from the box and the last person(s) have a fair chance nothing's left in the box. I got the feeling that when everyone's lying, the boss first guess are just that: guesses. Wouldnt mind playing it again, but somehow I expected more.

Very enjoyable bluffing game in the vein of Sheriff Of Nottingham mixed with Resistance.  One great thing about it is that you get to choose your role and have a say in how the game will play out for you.  Very interesting and different.

RATING: 3
This tries to reach for the top with some new and interesting features, but ultimately fails to make a deeper impression because you always know what you got and what you gave to your neighbor - so lying will fail a lot more often than in other secret character games. Which makes it less attractive compared to other members of the genre. I'd prefer at least three other SCGs over this one, which means this one had its 15 minutes of fame and that's it.

Fun and quick social deduction game. I can see it being more fun with more players. We only had 6. Everyone selects either a role or steals gems. The boss needs to find all the thieves. If he forces a non thief/non agent to empty his pockets, he loses and the thief with the most gems wins. The driver wins by being left of the winner. The agent wins by being forced to empty his pockets. The henchmen twin if the boss does. All around amusing.

I'm all for a good hidden role game but this one was just awful.  I felt it didn't leave you with any room to try to bluff as it seemed to force you into what you could and couldn't do.  The role of Boss and his lieutenant (?) or the FBI agent seemed way to powerful in the knowledge they had.  the best thing about this game was that it was over relatively quickly.

Currently prefer With Hunt for my social deduction kick but this one is reasonably fun. 

I recommend getting something to keep the box shut after opening it.  The box is a fake cigar box and you pass it around to play the game.  The problem comes in later that it opens back up too easily for things to not fall out without something like a large rubber band.

Short party game in which one player plays The Don. He passes around a cigar box with diamonds and roles for the other players. They take something out or not, and then when the Don gets back the box, he needs to find out who stole his diamonds and which of the players are true to him by putting questions to the other players. If he can single out the thieves he and his true disciples win the game.
Game is fun to play with people you don't know. But you need to be with at least 6 players.

As with any 'social' party game, the mileage on this varies depending on who you are playing with, but I appreciate that there is an element of logic that comes into play, both as the Don, and as another player, whereby you can figure out what items are missing when you get the box and have a decent idea of who is who, allowing for some great lying (from anti-Don) folks, and some great pleading for the Don to believe them (from the pro-Don folks).  This game will continue to get pulled out during our large group gaming nights for some time to come I imagine.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A game of hidden identities in the tradition of Werewolf. The major difference is that players have some limited influence on which roles they get to play, and the game is more or less driven by the Don who's trying to find out who stole from him. Which is probably the big weakness of the game since the other players may or may not be engaged throughout. There is also definitely an imbalance between players sitting close to the Don and those further away in turn order. I'm not sure whether that's actually a problem, but it's certainly something to be aware of.

I like the interesting take on this game, you choose your role as the game goes. Plays like a one night version of mafia.

The godfather here is a lot harder than playing as a player but that's not to say that the players don't have to figure out what crafty lies and information they give out without getting caught

I love the idea of a traitor game where you have the choice of roles. Sometimes you don't have the choice if you're late in the turn order, but still. The components are great, I like that the box is used during gameplay and that you need to stash stuff on your person. The game promotes roleplaying, plays better with larger groups and is a lot of fun when everything works out. The game slows down when the box is passed around since everyone is double checking the contents and deciding what to take, which is a shame because the second half of the game is lightning fast and very engaging. Sometimes the board state feels "solved" and it definitely seems harder for the thieves to win, which is why it's only an 8.

Played this game four times in different positions and couldn't get any fun out of it. Out of the 6 playing at the time, 2 really enjoyed it, hence the four rating. It wasn't challenging at all trying to guess who took diamonds and who didn't. I'll have to revisit the game later and give it another try. Maybe we weren't playing properly.

A very interesting twist of a hidden role/deduction game, where the players take stuff out of a box. The Don has to recover it by questioning the players and trying to connect those threads into a bigger story to find out where it breaks.

It's one of the few where you can pick your role (and during the game, nonetheless!).

Must try it with different number of players.

After a lot of plays, I read the post on the Nash Equilibrium in this game. In retrospect, should have seen it coming, but the game holds such promise and fun otherwise. There are ways to counteract this, but just knowing about this is enough to set my teeth on edge.

Won't reduce the rating just because of that. For a while, there's a lot that goes right in this game.

Edit: It's a solvable problem.

RATING: 5
What Mafia de Cuba makes less appealing than the other social deduction games is the fact that only one person is in charge.. sure the others can lie and stuff, but it's basically the godfather asking questions one by one and then deciding.
And that is not as much fun as when everyone can chip in into the group discussion.

Also if you're at the end of the line, you often don't get to choose anything. You simply have to take the one thing that's left (usualy not the most interesting one).

The theme is where this actually shines, people start acting out these mafia tropes, wich can be really cool. But overall less fun than the rest of its ilk.

(the roles themselves aren't particularly varied or interesting too, especially the driver)

What began as an interesting game eventually broke down into an easily solvable activity. There's no incentive to take fewer than all the diamonds, meaning a large enough group will result in half the players having no information to go on. Do not recommend.

RATING: 6
Mafia de Cuba feels like an anti-Spyfall, where one player has to outsmart the table by reading other players correctly instead of one player needing to have others read them incorrectly. Like playing the Spy, being the Godfather is very difficult for first-time players. It almost seems random which action each person takes until one starts to discover the kinds of questions that can provide clues about each player's loyalty.

While it's a fairly easy game to teach, I don't feel the game provides enough information (especially in large games) to provide much for the Godfather to use. I'm not a fan of social deduction games that do this, but this game can still be enjoyable with a player who has learned some of the nuances of being the Godfather.

Initial Rating: 6.5 (November 2015)

I love party games that have secret identities mechanisms and I have had some good laughs with Mafia de Cuba. Still there is something that bothers me with the game and I have been unable to pinpoint what is it. Thanks to this I don’t want to play it as often as I thought I would.

The game rules are very easy to teach, you can do it under 3 minutes. The cigar box is gorgeous and well designed and the playtime is often under 12 minutes, however you need the correct game group to play it or it won’t be as fun. Also with slow godfathers, the playtime can rise steeply.

LOVE the bluffing aspect inherent in the game, the best role by far is the Godfather himself, it is also the most difficult to play successfully. It is also nice that, unlike other games in the genre, Mafia de Cuba lets the players choose their role (most of the time).

On the bad side, perhaps it is a bit expensive for how little it comes in the box (although the components are nice), I also feel they could have added more variability (more roles) right from the beginning, instead, now you have to buy a separate expansion that costs almost as much as the base game and that was released at the same time (I believe).

Bottom line, Mafia de Cuba is a solid party game, but for some reason, my desire to play it isn’t as high as I thought it would be. Perhaps that has to do with the fact that the game revolves around the Godfather, he regulates/controls the game and the other players are at his mercy. This isn’t a bad thing, but perhaps it is what has been bothering me about Mafia de Cuba. I will probably sell my copy of the game.

This is a fun, light hidden role game. It's a very unique take on the genre, and involves most of the players actually choosing which role they will be. It took my group a couple of plays to get into the bluffing aspect of it, and it kind of falls down if everyone is just honest during the interrogation.

RATING: 4
This is a social deduction game where each round one person plays "The Godfather" (Cuban-Style, so I guess more like Scarface?) and hands around a cigar box full of diamonds and chips that represent certain roles, some friendly to the Godfather, some not. As the box is passed around, everyone takes something secretly from the box - either diamonds or a role chip - and when the Godfather gets the box back and finds missing items, she has to guess who stole the diamonds without picking the police agent. The Godfather can ask any questions, but nobody has to answer honestly. The guess, when made, is just right or wrong.

While it might be interesting to be The Godfather, the other players can only give false answers and misdirection, or just tune out until the next game they can actually participate in.

For the player who is the Godfather this is very much a game of logic.  Knowing in what order to ask questions is as important as knowing what question to ask.
Because you usually have some amount of control over what role you play, people who claim they can't lie are still able to play the game.

RATING: 6
A simple social deduction game where all the deduction (and accusation) is done by a single player, the Don.
At the start of the game players choose if they want to be loyal to the Don or thiefs, by choosing to take henchman tokens or diamonds in secret.
Then the Don tries to take back all the tokens making questions, assumptions and trying to single out the players loyal to him.

Interesting social deduction game where you (as the crime boss or godfather) pass around a cigar box with chips that represent rolls and a quantity of diamonds.  Each player secretly takes a number of diamonds or a roll chip from the box.  When the box goes around the gable and back to the godfather, he has to ask questions about what players saw in the box when they had it to try to figure out who is loyal to him and who has stolen his gems.

Social deduction game about finding the correct set of stories to believe. One person is the godfather and attempts to get all of their diamonds back, everyone else is either a henchman, driver, agent, thief, or street urchin. The variable roles are cool and add a nice touch, still I don't think this holds up as well to other social deduction games. Fun nonetheless.

RATING: 6
Good but not great. The best and worst part about it is how light it is, both in terms of mechanisms and depth. Its free flow of play makes games feel smooth and leaves a lot of rooms for small talk and jokes, which is great. But, at the same time, its simplicity kind of hurts the game's balance, making certain positions and roles way more interesting than others. Still, the experience is fun, just don't take it too seriously.

I love that game and I want to give it a 10, but:

The enjoyment of games like "Mafia De Cuba" is always very dependent on the group of people you play with. There are just some people who don't get into the game that well and in that case the game rating is just a 6 or 7.

If you play Mafia De Cuba with people who are passionate about it and who get into the game and have fun it is a 10 rating.

Great, great components as well.

Cool idea to let people choose their role. The standard game is too easy for the godfather though. Sadly, like most social deduction games it doesn't seem to hold up to scrutiny. E.g. It seem like the last player should almost always choose to be a street urchin making it a pretty boring game for them.

Ich glaube 6 Mitspieler sind für das Spiel noch ein wenig... zu wenig... Die Diskussion macht echt Spaß. Die anderen zu verwirren ist toll. Wenn man es runterspielt und "jeder" die Wahrheit sagt, bzw. nichts sagt, dann wird's für den Paten zu einfach und es kommt kein fun auf. Bei unserem Verwirrspiel hat aber auch das verlieren Spaß gemacht :)
Zu sechst aber lieber Werwölfe Vollmondnacht, mit mehr würd ichs auf jeden Fall nochmal spielen. Es braucht aber leider auch seine Zeit bis man ins Spiel rein kommt. Am besten man überlegt sich schon seine Alibigeschichte, sobald man etwas aus der Schachtel nimmt. Hintergrundmusik wäre ebenfalls wünschenswert oder ich muss ein "Fließ" in die Schachtel legen, dass nicht jeder mitbekommt ob noch Diamanten in der Schachtel herumfliegen... das hört man nämlich leider ;(

The Don has been robbed blind of his diamonds, but whom at the table could be the thieves? Mafia de Cuba is a hidden role game for up to 12 players with the interesting twist that players pick their take from the box rather than have it assigned to them. Do you want to be a loyal henchman, a skittish driver, a seedy FBI agent, or do you think you can lie your way out of taking all the diamonds at the table?

I have had this for quite a while and never had the opportunity to play it. I guess I was looking for an alternative experience to Avalon which I really enjoy. This was 3 plays with about 10 players, the majority of whom I had never met before. One was though a friend and I kinda felt bad pointing out that in all probability he had stolen a diamond but hey I was a loyal henchman and well to be honest I didn't feel all that bad for too long!

It was enjoyable, but I guess I would really like to play it with people I know. The wrinkle to the game here is that each player gets to choose which role they play. This is an important change from, say, Avalon, where players may be stressed to see their random dealt alignment card means they have to turn to the dark side and evade the beady eye of Merlin's do-gooders, something which may increase stress and consequently lesson their enjoyment of the game.

Here one player is the mafia boss, and he has summoned all his associates for a meeting, but somehow (a la Gove's last minute call to Boris) he has been distracted and leaves the room. The rest of the players being the loyal people they are, descend immediately on his cigar box (which in a state of distraction the mafia boss left on his desk - I personally would be more of a locked humidor sort of guy). The box is passed around the rest of the players and they can either steal diamonds or take a chip (exactly same quality chips as Splendor) which has a role on it, which they then adopt for the rest of the game. The roles vary from loyal henchman, driver, cleaner (no not the mop kind just channel your inner Mr. Wolfe) and FBI / CIA agent. They all win by slightly different outcomes of the discussions held by the mafia boss when he comes back in the room and tries to recover his diamonds from his thieving associates.

As I said I enjoyed it, but some guys were taking such wild choices in what to take from the box that my eight year old would finger them straight away as the person who had stolen all their haribos. I mean if there is 13 diamonds in the box when you get it and the next guy reports 0 when he got it, it is extremely obvious that your pockets are bulging!

I would love to play it again and I can see keeping it alongside Avalon as I think there is room for both on my shelves. For me, the main advantages to choosing this game is it is much quicker than Avalon, and similarily, strategies reveal themselves with multiple plays so you are more likely to get multiple plays in over an evening. Secondly you get to choose your role, which like myself I am sure many players will appreciate, as you tailor the experience to your personal enjoyment.

I want to enjoy this game but when compared to other social deduction games like ONUW and The Resistance, there is no reason to get this game.

The foundations of the game seem to work together, but I feel like it's missing an extra mechanic or something that gives concrete information to the player.  While I don't mind games that are completely reliant on social cues (like ONUW), ONUW forces a story that a player needs to come up and each role forces a different way to approach things.  Mafia De Cuba's discussion is only limited to what was inside the box, thus making it dull.

The big difference with Werewolves, is that no player is set on the side! The whole discussion is made together and the game ends with one side winning. Player also choose which side they are on! It's shorter, but the discussions are on the same level (who could be guilty of stealing, etc). I do enjoy it much more than Werewolves.

A more niche hidden roles game, due to the various win conditions for the different roles/teams it is more complex than others such as werewolf or the resistance so players will be slower to develop strategies, as claiming to be bad is a legitimate tactic in this game; which may turn players off the game and prefer others.

However if people learn the roles and understand the game well enough it can be just as good as other games in this genre but in a unique and different way.

This is an interesting game that combines social-deduction with actual deduction.  After 2 plays at 7-players, I'm worried that the choice of what to take from the box is not very interesting:  either there will be no choices or the optimal choice is obvious.  Also, I'm worried that there is very little room to lie, the Don should be able to solve this every game.

Mafia de Cuba is a fun deduction game that like most social deduction games depends heavily on your group. I unfortunately never managed to get much traction with it. 

There are a number of items in the box, diamonds and poker chips that denote roles. One player is the Godfather, they pass the box around and everyone else must take something out of the box. Choose a poker chip (which each have their own winning conditions) or steal some diamonds which makes you a thief. The Godfather will then try and recover his diamonds through questions and accusations. The roles complicate this as some want the Godfather to win and some have their own agenda. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Serviceable deduction game where all of the burden of deduction is essentially transferred to the godfather character. Not too engaging due to the limited influence a single person has on the game, but plays very quickly with a novel concept. Good for a party environment.

For each number of players I've tried, there has been an easy to find optimal set of decisions. As long as everyone is aware of it, there is zero incentive to to anything else provided one's objective is to win. Maybe randomising the starting setup could shake things around, but I don't have enough patience with broken party games to want to find it out.

RATING: 7
Social party game with hidden roles, with enough entity to stand out of its own from the big beasts of this genre. 

It invites to roleplay and the experience depends heavily on the involvement of the players. But contrary to other games (like most of the storytelling games), Mafia de Cuba mechanisms carry the load of the game, the players just need to tag and play along it.

It doesn't have the brilliance of [thing=147949][/thing] and certainly doesn't offer as many options. Replayability might be an issue.

I had the impression that for the loyal team to win.

On the other side, the setup time is considerably shorter and less fussy than Ultimate Werewolf, for example.

The production level is great, but you pay of it.

Overall, it's one of those games that will certainly see table time evry noew and then.

[b]Mafia de Cuba[/b]

[i]I played this with a fun group, there were 6 of us, and had a good time. After 3 quick games I still think we were all getting a handle on how the game worked and what constituted an effective bluff. Adding physical components (diamonds/character tokens) gave you some additional info to go on when you were trying to figure out who was who. However; while the cigar box was awesome it was way to easy to hear people rustling around in the box and potentially figuring out whether or not there was anything in the there. Having a felt bottom would have helped dampen the sound since knowing when/if the box got emptied is a huge tell. 

Overall it was a fun experience, but we followed up this with Cockroach Poker and the simplicity of that bluffing game still trumps any of the others I've played. I'd like to play again, but the minimum player count is 6, so I'm not sure how likely that'll be unless I'm at a con.[/i]

RATING: 4
Social deduction is one of my least favorite genres of games, but Mafia de Cuba seems to have some issues on top of that.  In this game, the "Mafia Don" takes some gems out of the box, and then passes it in a circle around the table.  Players can either steal some of the Don's remaining gems, or take a role chip, making them either a henchman, an FBI agent, or a driver.  Once everyone has taken something from the box, the Don tries to figure out who stole the gems; if he accuses two people incorrectly, he loses.  My concerns about the game are largely due to turn order imbalance--it's much harder for players close to the beginning of the turn order to steal gems as they are more easily discovered, and players late in the turn order may have no choice but to steal gems if the roles are gone (or they may be forced to take a role they don't want if the ones they want are gone).  That leaves me with kind of a bad taste in my mouth.

One of the best party game I've ever played. Also interesting. 

I found two reasons why this is a really good game:

1. The simplicity in the components for the game. Un like other games that need a board, here, you just need chips, diamonts and the rest, "a real talk" between players, because, at least one player (the Don), needs to create their own conclusion about the other rolls in the game and, 

2. The sides. Unlike other game, where there are just two sides (in most cases: goods and bads), here, there are more than 2, depend of the characters: 
- the loyal henchmen (white chips) 
- cia's and fbi's agents (blue chips)
- drivers (green chips) (depend of the other sides)
- the cleaner (red chip)
and the thiefs and the street urchin (people who steal diamonts).
So, in total, there are 4 sides and just one can win (in individual or group form). 

Additionally, the art of the box is gorgeous.

This social deduction game's USP is the increased player agency, but we played with six and it seemed there was rarely a choice left for the last three players (steal X diamonds) and that the most obvious move was for the first player after the Godfather to take the Henchman and bag the Agent. A lot of pressure on the Godfather, in a similar vein to Codenames' Spymaster, but with less information. Higher player counts may deal with this issue.

Pretty much I feel about this game the same way I feel about most social deduction games.

I want to be able to make decisions based on information, not inferred information. So. That's it. I can sorta have fun playing these games, but winning isn't really something I personally find I can accomplish through skill, so I don't really play to win, which seems... counter-intuitive in a game where you're supposed to play to win.

RATING: 5
Mafia de Cuba brings some neat ideas to the hidden role genre. Two in particular are very unique: players picking their secret role and the idea of the Godfather. The former is good because it means people don't get stuck with the same roles (or don't have to be the one to lie if they don't want to). The latter is cool because rather than the table trying to figure out the web of lies, it's only one player. Being the Godfather is pretty fun and chaotic as everyone else tries to profess their innocence to you. While the former is a great inclusion, the latter isn't quite a full success in practice. It misses the group dynamic of games like The Resistance or my favourite Secret Hitler. Lines of questioning from the Godfather tend to be quite limited outside of "what did you see in the box?" After this, the player has to then just make an informed guess. While simplicity is a plus, some games can suffer from TOO FEW mechanics to guide the experience and leave too much to the players to fill in the gaps. Mafia de Cuba is a fun party game but ultimately misses out on being an essential game for this reason.

I like that the game box is used for gameplay, that is kind of cool. Hard to say how good this is after only one play. Seems like it's a very different deductive type game and therefore with an inexperienced group the strategy seemed very foreign to all of us and it didn't really work well.

A lighter, sillier, and more melodramatic variant on the same theme as One Night Werewolf.
That said, Mafia de Cuba plays differently enough to stand apart, and somehow manages to be even more engaging and hilarious than rounds of ONW usually are.   

However, once the laughter dies down the game will start to feel a little one-note.

Edit after a few plays: 
While the charm of Mafia persists, there are some design issues which lead to loyal mafia players winning 100% of the time assuming all players make perfectly optimal decisions.  
Don't play this too often with an analytically minded group or they'll eventually figure it out.

A social deduction game in which players may actually choose their role.

However, thieves have limited opportunities to win, since either the player to their left or the player to their right will be able to fish out a lie immediately. A thief's best chance may be if there are thieves both before and after him in player order.

Overrated...

Game gained a point now I played with higher player counts. 

What makes or breaks this game is how much everyone can remember what was on the box and how much the players from the "bad" team want to support each other in a single row of bad guys.

If the meta does not support it, you will have drivers who cannot lie about their position, agents who cannot blow their cover and thiefs who will always have to lie about the previous person and hope the capo believes them.

In those games, most of the time the capo had to do 2/3 of those 50/50 situations and eventually hit a FBI agent. In the situations all the first players picked roles, the capo won every single time.

A game which only works when someone forgets what was on the box, because with perfect information is impossible to create a convincing story every single time.

In this deduction game nearly all components are thematic and needed for gameplay. The whole box passes through from the Godfather to every single player until it returns to the Don. Who stole the gems? Who is who?

So, the game is technically broken if played in a certain way.  I don't care about that---just play with people who don't insist on playing with perfect strategy.

Shortly after the first few games, we had a steady stream of folks rotating in to play as they passed by and wondered what we were doing. Peering into a cigar box has that effect on people. This is a tremendous take on the social deduction style game. Tons of fun.

This game fell flat with my group, who typically loves these role-deduction games. The problems they faced were three-fold; the players last in line have few interesting decisions, the process of extracting contents takes about as long as the actual accusations, and that players need to be number-minded to ensure that their story 'fits' into the general description of other players.

Allowing each player to select their role goes a long way towards making each person feel like they actually participated in the game. In the Resistance or Werewolf, I find there's always a few people who socially dominate the table while everyone else just sits and watches. That can happen here too, but since everyone got the box at one point, they all have valuable input. I also find that unlike The Resistance or Werewolf, it's more entertaining when people lie, the usual result being two people's stories don't match. The other games usually turn to shouting matches as people point fingers and accuse each other of being the traitor.

Update: Played multiple times and we have determined that the game is just broken. The first few moves are automatic and the game always plays out the same way if people are playing to win. On the forums people have pointed out how the game is broken and the designer's response was basically "if you don't make the optimal moves that guarantee a win, then the game isn't broken." That's not something a fan of balanced board games ever wants to hear.

The game seemed promising and I hope someone eventually makes a superior game based on the idea of secretly selecting your own role.

Seems to be a bit like One Night Ultimate Werewolf, but one that has a longer round.

I need to play it more, but essentially it does away with people having a role or character they're not keen on, as they can choose themselves.  This also eliminates games where you have players who do not actively play.

However, I think the team aspect of Resistance, and the seeds you sow or reap in each round having a lasting effect, makes that game better for me.

We shall see though if more plays changes my mind.

A sort of middle ground between One Night Ultimate Werewolf and Resistance.  

It's good and relatively quick, but I just still think I prefer resistance

Ótimo party para jogar com bastante gente. Mais do que um board game, cabe mais como uma interação social e um pouco de teatro. Muito divertido com o grupo certo.

fun and quick alternative to secret hitler / mafia.
DIY PNP is easy to create if you want to make a better box than the original game.
I'm using funny business cards to replace the tokens, with a character name, role and quick description, and used monopoly money to replace the diamonds.

Manages to be a lot of fun - for a couple games at least - despite being a fairly broken and weakly designed game.

Core concepts are fun enough, but there are often clearly correct choices that will relevantly improve your chances of winning.

Straight-up broken with 8 or 9 players rules-as-written.  Has false choices because the game assumes people aren't actually playing to win the game.

Kind of interesting, but didn't seem to keep the whole group as actively involved as many other similar games do.

Can be slightly fiddly with people pocketing the diamonds. Isn't overly stressful, but the game limits the amount of table talk as it's all in the hands of the godfather

'Mafia de Cuba' is actually a very simple game, where one person id the Don, who is trying to recover stolen diamonds, and establish who is loyal and who is not. We played with seven, and I think it would work better with more people, for reasons I'll explain in a mo. There are fifteen diamonds, a black bag and in the game we played, four character pieces. the game itself is actually designed as a life-size cigar box, containing all of these items, and to start, the player immediately to the left of the Don, chooses if they want to place one of the character pieces into the bag, and whether they do or not, the black bag is placed incognito somewhere until the end of the game. each player, including the one sitting to the left of the Don, may then choose to either steal some or all of the diamonds that remain or take one of any remaining character pieces. These are; FBI agent, 'cleaner', 'driver' and/or 'loyal henchmen', and any persons who draw last, where there are no items left become 'street urchins' .needless to say, this happened quite regularly, so there were always two of these 'unremarkable characters! Once the cigar box had been passed round all six non-Don players, the Don looked into his cigar box, finding he'd been robbed blind, only to begin immediate investigation. This is a bluffing game, and whilst not conspiracy themed, has a similar feel to it. It is a fun game when played with enthusiastic Mafia wannabes but it is extremely difficult for the Don to 'win' (by correctly identifying who has stolen his diamonds) unless the loyal henchmen, and to some extent the 'cleaner' and 'driver' act in concert with him, hence needing more character pieces in play. I believe this game would work best where everyone has a character piece they can draw, perhaps altering the odds by the first player left of the Don changing 'the mix' rather than withdrawing one character (potentially). There are accusations and there may be trips to sleep with the fishes. It is a tactical game. If the FBI agent is accused of being a thief, he wins, and the Don doesn't. The driver wins if he the person sitting to the right of him wins. The loyal henchmen wins if the Don wins. I forget the victory conditions for the cleaners and the street urchins but there is logic to them. it is game that encourages interaction and the permutations would be better with more character pieces in my opinion. A good evening that reached the 15 certificate cinema rating but never really crossed the line....Splendid.

Another social deduction game, with the twist that you can choose your own role. Without the expansion characters it can devolve pretty soon in a Nash equilibrium scenario. Splendid components.

RATING: 9
An extremely clever bluffing game that gives you the crazy mix of personalized allegiances you'd expect from something like ONUW, only in a non-timed, much more calculated, tight, classy package.

The one downside, the only thing that keeps this masterpiece from being a 10, is that this is undefendably a game that breaks. There are ways to break it that are so obvious that they can happen both accidentally and on purpose. It has to do with role selection, and there's really no way around it.

Also, this is tricky for newbies. Don't expect children to get it at all.

Otherwise, get this hidden gem. It's worth it.

The social deduction game sometimes feels like a slightly crowded market due to the core gameplay similarities. The thing I really appreciate about this game is it deals with those who are less comfortable in some roles by allowing people to choose their role for the game. However, this does mean with an inflexible group you can predict more what some will do. Critically, for me the game falls down on the mafia boss system which makes it feel like one person is playing a lot more of the game than others.

You could consider this the 'light' version of The Resistance. However, the ruleset is a little TOO light and it's often easy for the Don to find out who the thieves are. Pluses are that the game supports up to 12 players and games only last ten minutes or so. Still there's plenty of other party games I would pick over this one.

I like this game, but it feels a bit... off. There's probably an optimal solution for choosing roles that takes away from the enjoyment. Keeping it because of theme and because I like hidden role social deduction games, but I'm guessing I won't play this often.

Fun game, but it's not that often for me that I have a high enough player count to bust this out. Creates fun conversations of players trying to come up with strategies and lies on the fly. It's fun to switch up who is able to be the Godfather for those that want to give it a try.

Un excellent jeu pour 8 joueurs et plus, une mécanique originale qui laisse la place à toutes les libertés et un matériel de premier ordre. Une petite perle qui change agréablement du classique Loup Garou, plus rapide, plus dynamique et plus méchant :)

I want to like it but it keeps falling flat. Supposedly a party game that shines with more people. However, parties means casual and non-gamers for me. The rules, while few, are hard to explain clearly and the questioning part leaves most people confused.

The game is fun, and it is well done.
But it did not consider the psicology of players while playing it. 
Often two scenarios occurs.
1) The first players pick the tokens from the box and the other can only take out diamonds. 
2) The first players remove the white tokens, or make other bad move against the godfather.

In the first scenario, the Godfather can resolve the game in trivial way. In the second one instead, solving the game is almost impossible. Too many variables, very few constraints

The game that made me break down and invest in some Dice Masters, going so far as to pick up starters and boosters for the Marvel and D&D versions, just to mix 'em up. The game plays like a hybrid of Magic the Gathering and a deck builder, with a hint of Yahtzee. A dice builder, but the joy of course is in how you put together custom teams and decide how many dice to allot to each, making for a ton of variation and strategy. Art looks good even if they cheese out and repeat the same picture for the 3-4 versions of each character. Another complaint is the paper 'dice bags' that come in the starters, which more or less look like you should be eating almonds or peanuts out of them.

This was one of the first deck building games I have purchased. At the time of purchase, I loved this game because it worked well. However, I can see some of the critiques that others have with the system. I still enjoy it. While I would not suggest it for gameplay, I would be more than willing to play it with anyone who is interested.

Interest low, just too pricey for what it is. Not impressed with quality control of dice, nor the publisher 's replacement policy. You get one chance of replacing as a group. I have 3 dice, interestingly from the same individual that need replacing. Balked because when I was collecting the cards/dice didn't want to get a rare, 
super rare that might need replacing. I had a damaged base card, they require you to sent the card for a replacement. If it is lost or they don't get it, you are out of luck. By the time I purchased something to ship it in, insured it, put post on it, wasn't worth it, I just purchased the damn card from CSI for 25 cents with a large order. Oh, replacing that would use all all your replacing options, lovely.

I will not be buying anything else from them until they clean up their act. This has to be a major cash cow they are miking. The cards are cheaply made as are the dice.

This game is lots of fun but expensive if you are trying to collect or even getting your favourite heros. This game is one of my favourites in my collection. I wish it came with the playmats and better storage. The game feels incomplete without adding accessories. It can be frustrating as with so my sets, there's getting to be too many rules. Newer sets are starting to change terminology cause confusion.

My first foray into Dice Masters and I see the appeal. It plays quickly and it's fun to see the characters. Not sure I'm totally grasping the strategy, though. I like the fact that there's more to learn. The collectible part was a bit off-putting, but at $1 a pack, it's accessible and actually adds some fun and excitement.

Like all the other games in this series, it is just fun to collect.   It's fun to play too.... although the luck factor is extremely high.   Maybe not as high as Quarriors, but pretty close.   Also, the A/D of the heroes is so high that the game tends to be over in just a few combats.   It feels like it is over too soon, but that could be from years of playing Magic.

A really great 2 player dice game. The best description is really more or less a cross between Quarriors and Magic the Gathering, which is a fantastic combination. It's fast and possibly the most strategic dice game I've ever played, with lots of great theme and wonderful artwork (not to mention all the gorgeous dice). The only two things to warn about I think are 1) it's collectable, which is sometimes fun but also sometimes irritating and 2) the combat rules can be confusing when first learning the game (in terms of knocked out vs used up). Otherwise it's fantastic.

Another step on the right direction in the evolution of an already great game. This set brings much more synergy between cards and maintains the strong theme to the card abilities. A particularly strong emphasis is placed on card interactions rather than just powerful cards. As a result, this set manages to make the game deeper without really make it any more complicated--that's the beauty of the Dice Masters game system, which has only scratched the surface of its potential.

I didn't know Dice Masters existed until two years after the fact, but it was apparently made for me.  Incorporating the good parts of deck building boardgames with the pre planning of deck building from CCGs and the gameplay of Magic and then blending it together with superhero and DnD themes created a Frankenstein masterpiece.  I love it and Jen loves it.  All our plays are recorded under Marvel Dice Masters: Age of Ultron because that was our first set and we play with all of the sets together.

The asymmetry and direct conflict is a welcome addition to the deck/pool building genre, but adding randomness on top of randomness is a major turnoff for me.

I like this game a lot, but I wish I loved it.  I love the deduction, theme, artwork etc. . . but this is primarily a different game with a deduction sub-game.  It's possible to win the game without knowing much of the underlying puzzle.  It has a lot of depth, the potential for double-bluffs when players have experience, and it's a tight game where you can get hosed by turn-order.  Still a very good game!

Great game that is hampered by its collectible nature and requirement to keep up with the relentless release schedule. Those factors made me give up on it.

PROS
- Great licensing here allowing you to play DC vs Marvel vs TMNT vs etc.
- overall the dice are very cool.
- quick playing with a small footprint.
- really good fan-made solo variant.
- "Dice building" mechanic twist on "deck building"
- There is some depth to the game if you get serious about it by collecting the "good" cards and/or looking for good combinations.
- Two good, serious players going head to head can be quite the cerebral battle as both attempt to setup combos and defensive counters.

CONS
- collectible nature of the game with tiered cards (Common, Uncommon, Rare, etc) means that it's not a level playing field like a LCG. Some people have cards others didn't get access too or weren't willing to buy in the secondary market.
- Wizkids quality control.
- Wizkids release schedule.
- The game doesn't promote characters as much as just random individual cards... so if you want to play Superman and Spiderman just for fun, their cards could potentially be terrible whereas Cheetah or Aunt May could be amazing cards.
- It's hard to play the game casually because then you miss the depth of the serious game. It can just become a random grind or very unbalanced because of the cards drafted or chosen for fun.
- Related to the above, there isn't any support for the casual player with for example recommended starting teams.
- Overall, not worth the price of keeping up with the game, hunting down cards, list building vs the overall gameplay experience.

Dice Masters is a MTG type deck building game that uses dice. You build a team of 8 characters, and by rolling for "energy" you can add better dice to your pool. The game incorporates MTG style rules (my fav. game) with deck building mechanics (another fav).

My problem is with The Chase. I can't stand The Chase. I want everything in my box, I don't want booster packs and junk like that, I just want the characters I want. After paying more than I care to admit on eBay to get what I wanted, the game is a lot of fun. It's hard to play because we can only play after the kids go to bed. Rolling dice is incredibly noisy when you don't want to wake a small child. We've had some fun, exciting, and really close games. We've had ten point swings, game saving/losing dice rolls, and really enjoy building our team of superheroes.

The Dice Masters system is much better than you would expect, just give it some time.

Dice Masters is effectively Magic the Gathering meets Quarriors except with a much better theme. Since I cannot stand MTG and Quarriors looked stupid it took a discount copy of the Uncanny X-Men starter set for me to even try this.

Pros:
* This gets better the more you play it and the more cards you own.
* Getting duplicate cards from buying boosters is not as bad as other CCG since you likely need the additional dice.

Cons:
* There are no good cases to really store the game properly. Dice Master's Team boxes are about the best you are going to get, so while they are good for the cards they are just OK for the dice.

[BGCOLOR=#A0A0FF][COLOR=#FFFFFF]xxG.[/COLOR][/BGCOLOR] Probably the last set I'll buy from. I have a playing partner for Dice Masters and between this and XvA and Uncanny X-men, we have a nice pool to build from.

All S, C, U, and R. Full dice for each card. All Basic Action Cards.

Basic Action Cards from Uncanny X-Men and Age of Ultron.

A solid 8 and that's where it is staying. The collectible nature of these games is a real turn off but I picked up a mostly complete set so that makes it fun. Can't imagine it would be fun without max dice.

My feelings on this match those I have for the Marvel sets. I'm happy to mesh the Marvel and DC sets, but I'm not going to do so with the others. (Yu-Gi-Oh and D&D)  It just would grate way too much.

No Flash, Aquaman, and Green Lantern in the starter set. I'm not searching for rares, I'm searching for basic characters. I was able to grab what I wanted cheap from CSI.

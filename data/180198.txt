RATING: 7.5
Easy fun filler. Has quite a bit of luck but since everyone is dealing with the same rolls, it's a sort of shared agony. The game starts off easy but the last couple rounds are damage control. That transition makes the game fun and interesting.

Another fun little roll & write game from Gamewright. This one is much more of a brain burner than Qwixx. You can really get yourself in a bad state ("state", get it?) if you aren't careful. Brian won our game with 7 X's to my 8. I totally screwed up the Southeast (yellow) region and had 3 X's there alone. This would be a fun solitaire excursion as well. I see myself holding on to this for many years.

Fun, light game- feels like a cross between Yahtzee ans Sudoku. Has some nice strategic choices and plays quickly. Biggest downside is this is about a pure multiplayer solitaire experience as you're likely to get, but then that will be a plus for a lot of players.

Rolling America is very similar to Qwixx which is probably my favorite filler game at the moment. To me Rolling America is a slower more thinky version of Qwixx. It was fun, but it takes a very light and random mechanic and adds a level of depth and strategy that is very much at odds with the luck factor. All in all I liked it but didn't love it.

(Comments based on the solo game)

This is a satisfying little exercise, and after only a few plays you'll notice yourself improving at the game - a sure sign of at least some level of strategy. However, the thing I want most from a puzzley game like this is simply to make a few moves per game that make me feel really clever. And while this is enjoyable enough and does begin to get the brain ticking after your first play, I'm not sure its opportunities for particularly clever or gut-wrenching choices are as pronounced as they are in similar games.

I suppose that's just a very long winded way of saying "Why play this when I could play Extra?" which is really the heart of the issue.

Still, the map makes for some fun little spatial decisions pretty unique in the light dice games category (or even solo games). I wouldn't steer anyone away from this game, but nor does it receive my categorical recommendation.

I'm still getting the hang of this, I think. We'll see how I feel about it over a few more plays.

Challenging dice game, really makes you think about number placement due to the adjacency rules. While you do have some lifelines with the dupe, color change, and guard actions they never seem to be enough for a game and you will wind up taking Xs at some point. Definitely makes you think more than Qwixx but seems to play just as quick. I like it.

Interesting little game I found at Target. It was published by Game Wright and was in a similar box to their other fun dice game Qwixx. Aside from a lack of player interaction this game is an interesting puzzle where you are constantly trying to find the best locations to put your numbers while not getting yourself in a situation where you are forced to place X's.

This is like a complicated logic puzzle that your math teacher gave you on a Friday because he ran out lessons for the week. At first I was into the idea, but as the game progresses it just gets agonizing and painful - and not in the way you like when playing board games.

And again, the advertised playing time is way off. Unless players can make snap decisions, it takes far longer.

Take my initial rating with a grain of salt, as it's based simply on one play; let's call it a first impression, not a final judgement.

Played this twice with two different groups and was blown away by how unintuitive some players find the neighboring states rules to be. It's a cute little game and I like the shared dice / separate judgment application, but watching others get frustrated due to rules misunderstandings and spatial challenges just sucked the fun out of the experience. I don't really get what happened because the game is simple, but seeing 5 or 6 out of 16 people totally not get it takes this off the table for me as a light-hearted gateway type of game. And when you get down to it, I'd rather play Qwixx of Quinto anyway,

A game where you draw two dice and then roll them. You place numbers on a map that looks roughly like the 50 US states.  The rule though is that you must put numbers in a location where it is no more than 1 different than all adjacent numbers.  You have to put an x otherwise.  You have some special abilities where can change the color of a dice or protect a region so the number does not count. It is a fun little solitaire game or can be played with any number of players.  Players with the fewest x's wins.

Acts as a light filler game.

RATING: 7
This is a surprisingly good little game from the designer of Trains - and it perhaps fits into the microgame category. 

The mechanics are interesting - draw two dice from a bag, roll them, and then all players either place each die's number in the appropriately colored region map of the U.S., use a special power (careful, these are limited and hurt you in a tiebreaker), or place an "X" because you can't put the die result in the appropriate region. The game provides a good amount of tough choices and gets tougher as it goes along.

Plays fast (except for those who agonize over decisions...) and is portable. We will take this with us as a quick game to play when traveling, out and about, or as a gateway / filler at meetups.

A nice little roll and write filler.
Simultaneous roll and write games always have a place, but this one was quite challenging and it didn't really feel rewarding, more like a chore as you didn't score stuff, you just tried to avoid getting penalties.

It was quite hard to get a good score for everyone playing.
Still a pretty good game.

Plays include fan-made maps.

[u]26-Dec-2017[/u]:  Another easy to learn, small box, quick playing RnW game for my collection. In this one, you roll 2d6 per turn, three turns per round, one die will not be used each round. Six of the dice match a color on the map, and the one clear die is a wild. You enter the number on the die in an area that matches the color (the wild die is a wild color, of course). The trick is that neighboring "states" must be of equal value or no more than +/- 1. Some states may only border two or three others, while some border five or six. You must use spacial reasoning to figure out how to fit in as many numbers onto the map as you can. There are three special actions you can use up to three times each during the game to help mitigate the luck of the dice. But even with those, it's a difficult task in which to do well. It's not as "gamery" as OctoDice or La Granja: No Siesta, but it does have an addictive quality to it. Another RnW winner, IMO.

Feels very similar to Quixx and games in that same bucket. One person rolls dice, and you fill out your scoring sheet accordingly. My only major complaint about this game is the scoring. It seems kind of silly that the person with the least amount of X's is the winner. This makes it so filling out an entire region of the map can be a good strategy, as you don't have to worry about dice in that color for the rest of the game. I do think this is less of a game and more of an activity, but it's kind of like Sudoku, in that way. I enjoy Rolling America, but I think that, like Quixx, I'll soon tire of it and move on to something else.

This is a very fun little game. Very puzzle-like. It's sort of a luck-mitigation game, but more fun than most games with that element, in part because the "luck" is so small and the other elements are bigger. Everyone is going to get the same dice rolls, so everyone had the same opportunities. Of course, you can make a choice early and get rolls that go for or against that choice, so in that sense there is some luck, but tactics and strategy have a definite impact on things. I really like the spatial component of the game, which is where most of the tactics factors in (putting a 6 in Hawaii is very different than putting it in Tennessee!). The special abilities are pretty key, also, though. All in all, it's a light game but it will appeal to people who like games with significant spatial elements. Also makes a good travel game, filler, or solo game.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]This another excellent dice filler that continues to see play when we have time for a 15 minute game (usually while I'm cooking). Right up there with Qwixx and Qwinto as my favorite light dice games. The Gamewright production is also quite nice for the price point, the dice are high quality with stars for pips which is a nice touch.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- A great gateway, dice filler available for less than $10.
- Excellent restaurant game with a tiny footprint and fast play time.
- Top notch production, the dice have stars for pips and a nice weight to them.

Rolling America is another really fun dice filler that will be competing for playing time with Qwixx. On the plus side for Rolling America is that my son likes it more than Qwixx, I'm not sure yet but probably still lean towards Qwixx. There isn't any player interaction, you each have your own map your filling in. You will enjoy this game if you like seeing how other people come up with different solutions while solving the same problem with the same die rolls. I enjoy Rolling America a lot, but then again I enjoy a lot of multi player solitaire games.[/i]

"True MPS filler, where everyone fills in their own map, based on common dice rolls (like in Bingo). Clever, puzzley, and mostly-abstract. Handy when you want a quick game that supports a lot of people."

What I like:
- Small box
- Quick play (15 minutes solo; 30 minutes with 5p)
- No attacking
- Lots of room for skill and tricky moves

What I don't like:
- Basically abstract, and more "thinky" than "fun"
- Bag is a bit small
- Several rules ambiguities

We weren't sure whether diagonal states were adjacent (we said no). We weren't sure if you had to write a legal number before guarding it (we said yes). We weren't sure if you could dupe the same die twice (we said yes). I think there were one or two others. 

BGG voters prefer the game with about 2 players. For me, this game shines at higher player counts (like 5), because it is mostly simultaneous. With just 2p, I would tend to play something else. 

I would put the weight around 1.5, which would be lower except that there is depth there. I think it's a bit lighter than BGG voters.

An...ok...dice filler.  It rightfully gets compared to Qwixx and Qwinto as it tries to fit in the same niche as those games.  It is a very light and portable dice game.  However, it is much more solitaire than the other mentioned games; the rules go so far as to mention swapping score sheets after the game so players can check for mistakes.  So in other words, the rules admit no one was paying an iota of attention to anyone else during the game. The same person could actually roll the dice every time and it would not matter.  I also think the game is more frustrating than fun and becomes quite monotonous after a while.  Mistakes do not really become apparent until midway through, so the first several turns feel like you are just slapping down random numbers hoping it just works out.  Qwixx and Qwinto offer better and more informed decisions from the beginning and both of these do a much better job of maintaining players' interest through the entirety of the game.

I swapped a duplicate Xmas present of Qwixx for Rolling America (reimplements Rolling Japan) and I rather like it. A pleasant multiplayer solitaire dice game which my wife enjoys too.

Bought in excellent condition from BGG Auction.  I was pleasantly surprised by this game.  Presents lots of interesting and agonizing choices as you go through the game.  Very fun and competitive, plus super easy to cart around and teach to others.

This game can be played single player, and the single player rules are identical. This game is the very definition of multiplayer solitaire. It works fine, but I find it to be a little boring.

Im kind of surprised by how much I enjoy this game, but its one I tend to suggest often. Its just dice rolling, but so strategic. And so good.

Much like Qwixx, this is a fun little dice game, What makes this interesting is trying to "place" your rolls on the scorepad in a way that you can get as many numbers out there. It gets harder and harder toward the end, and I think that the near-impossiblity of getting a perfect score makes this compelling for me.

It's an OK filler, I suppose. Super light, not terribly interesting. 

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
Each round (of 8), players in turn draw and roll 2d6 from the bag (6 match colors of regions on your map; 1 wild die. Players write a number on their map in any empty region (if available) of the matching color. Adjacent regions must have numbers within +/-1 range. Players also have limited numbers of single-use powers (play in non-matching region; ignore +/-1 rule, use a die twice in one region). If you cannot place the number, mark a region with an X. At the end of the game, the player with the fewest Xs wins!

Fine little game. Nothing amazing but one I would keep and play once in a while, feels like a "restaurant game", that is, something to play while you wait for your food to come.

tl;dr: light, but not easy

Just what the world needed: an other of those "roll dice, fill in the paper" games. But as long as they're fun, people will play them, and people with keep on publishing them.
In this game you fill in the values of the rolled dice in a matching region of the same color. Sounds easy enough, but the difference between adjacent regions can't be more than 1, and once a few numbers are filled in, that will lead to problems. The trick is to foresee that and plan ahead. But of course you don't know what numbers will be rolled in that color next, so while you can plan, that plan can very well go wrong. A few modifiers that you can use are there to help you out on some occasions, but they come in short supply, so use them well.
So the rules are dead simple, but playing well is tricky. I enjoy the challenge.

Rolling America is a dice rolling game where taking turns doesn't really matter. What do I mean? Well, after someone rolls the dice, everyone must add the resulting numbers to their player-sheet. In other words, it doesn't matter who rolls the dice. Taking turns feels like a vestigial organ, even if it does provide everyone with the opportunity to participate in the visceral pleasure of tumbling little star-studded cubes across the table.

But enough of that. Is the game any good? In short, yes! It's a neat little puzzle of a game that becomes increasingly and sneakily frustrating as your board fills up. There comes a time during each game with new players when they realize the snooze-fest they thought they were playing turns sit up straight tricky. That's a great moment to witness.

Where I knock the game is in its rules, which seem unnecessarily complicated for what should be a quick filler. The three special powers are difficult to explain, and could do with a few extra lines of clarification in the rule sheet. Moreover, these extra complications, while fun, can also lead to errors and mistakes -- especially because the spatial nature of the map can be confusing if you overlook an adjoining border without realizing it. I know, it seems like that sort of thing would never happen, but it does! I'm not really sure I can blame the game designer here, but the fact remains that, in practice, Rolling America ends up feeling more complex than it need to be.

Finally, it's a bit long! Perhaps a smaller map would help. Maybe Rolling Japan (nope, turns out the map is effectively just as large) or Qwinto is more my style.

Ever since I played Rolling Japan, I've been jonesing for my Rollin' fix. Picked up a copy, already played like 12 times in a week. 

I can't explain why I love this game so much, but I love it.

Another quick and small dice rolling filler game. Its pretty fun and easy to learn. There is a lot more strategy to this game than meets the eye which is awesome.

Super simple but really great. The choices get tougher as you go and it is great to compare your scores at the end. It is not so much of a game as Karuba which has the tension of the race for items but the portability and ease of set up makes it a great addition and my non gamer family members seem to love it.

This game is fantastic for what it is.  You start out thinking this isn't  too bad I probably won't even need the special powers, and then you get to the 7th round, and that initial content turns to stress and you start to think OMG!!! WHY WOULD ANYONE MAKE THIS A GAME!!  I ALREADY USED ALL MY DUPS AND COLOR CHANGES AND I HAVE ONE GUARD LEFT.  I didn't think such a simplistic game could give me such anxiety. Although, with that being said it is still a game that when it is over I find myself saying "let's run it back."  fantastic quick game with a lot of strategy.

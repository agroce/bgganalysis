After a couple of plays, I see that this is an extremely defensive game. Players play conservatively and more conservatively and then try to seize an opportunity. You're a fool to go on the offense unless it will immediately pay off. Components are decent and the cards are a nice stock.They could have made the number/symbol different on each card suit to help note what suit it is. As it is, you can't tell a dwarf from a hunter until you look at the entire face of the card. I would have preferred a corner symbol (like the number beside say a bow for the hunter). The board serves its purpose with some pretty art work but don't most trolls live in caves or under bridges? Then there's the plastic dragon piece color issue. My dragon was blue. Luckily, I own the Blue Moon card game and just swapped out a red dragon from that game. Given the artwork and all, anything but a red dragon just doesn't seem right.

Update: we continue to enjoy this game and play it weekly at lunch so I've upped my rating from 7.1 to 8.0 for now. Note to publisher: this could also be a dynamite 3 player game if an expansion were offered. A new deck of a different color and a tweak of the ship rules would seem all that was necessary to expand it to 3 players.

leichtes Gameplay und nett zu spielen. Aber mal sehen wie der Langzeitspaß ist ? Ich fürchte nicht alzu lange, deshalb nur eine 6. abe auf 5 runtergestuft, weils genauso ist wie befürchtet. Zudem kommt ein hohes Maß an Kartenglück hinzu wo man manchmal nur zuschaut wie der andere die Punkte macht. Schade. Zu wenig Variation einfach!

If I you wanted to have an example of a game that creates an illusion of meaningful decisions but actually is a purely luck driven, Dragonheart could be good candidate. Your only real choice is to refrain from playing cards that would give your opponent a good scoring opportunity. The thing is that after a few rounds either you or your opponent runs out of suitable cards and you must play a card you wouldn’t want to. Then it is just a question whether the other player has the card to seize that opportunity or not. If not, you win. If yes, you lose. By the mid-game the whole exercise has become stale in its monotonousness. I could recommend the game only to younger kids as a lesson in creating and seizing opportunities. Moreover, players who do not mind the fact that your fate is shuffled into the deck and your task is only to make the right guesses can find Dragonheart quite entertaining.

Plays quickly, very tactical with a cat and mouse feeling, where you try to goad and trap your opponent, while escaping his claws. A nice filler with some welcome tension.

Oh, and it's completely themeless. The arrows on the board are really a necessity to show the flow of the game.

Sometimes a game can be perfectly functional and well produced, but leave the player with an overall feeling of ... meh.  Dragonheart is one such game.  The core game play is a mix of set collection mixed with a kind of rock-scissor-paper mechanic.  This combination is interesting, but that's where the interest ends.  The game's theme is entirely for presentation.  The game play ends up feeling mechanical.  Yes, the mechanics all work and the game is balanced and playable.  As a 2-player filler it can work, but it is not one that needs to be hunted down for a 2-player experience.  The ideas behind the design are far more interesting than the game itself.

2 player fantasy card game. Simple to teach and quick to play, which are always pluses for me. You collect cards by laying down enough of other cards that can "capture" the cards. The board is extremely helpful in showing what can capture what. I think the GF will enjoy this as well, which is always a good thing.

One of my biggest disappointments is the fact that I don't get much opportunity for 2 player games, and it's fun ones like this that make it sting even more. The card play is actually quite simple, even though it sounded like it was going to be confusing. A good board design helps with that. I really enjoy the way the game gives you tough decisions basically every turn. It's tempting to dangle some points out there so that you can grab them, but your opponent might be waiting for the exact same thing. The scores were difficult to assess during the game, which made the final results a nice surprise. In fact I thought I was winning quite handily only to find that I lost by a half dozen points. And, thanks to the identical decks, a player can rush out to a lead but the opponent will likely have a chance at catching back up. Of course this isn't a manufactured catch-up mechanism, the player has to play their cards right, but I like that the potential is there. If I played more 2 player, this would definitely be a game I would add to my collection.

Once you get the basics told to you, the game is surprisingly intuitive when looking at the board. I like all the neat interactions, but I don't like when you are in a situation where you cannot capture anything and are just playing something and hoping the other person cant take it. That isnt a ton of the game, but it happens enough.

Not fun.  The winner is determined almost entirely by luck of the cards.  There is a small amount of strategy, but it is overshadowed by the need to draw the right cards at the right time.  I played 3 straight games, and the winner finished with more than 2x, 4x and 3x the number of points of the loser, respectively.  When every play ends in a landslide, it's just not fun.

RATING: 7
Fun 2-player.  At first I thought this one to be more strategic than Lost Cities, but after playing several times I realize that the smaller number of "suits" in Lost Cities yields slightly more control of "strategic" play.  They are both great 2 player games.  This one definitely has more theme to it, but Lost Cities feels like a slightly better game.

Played with Andrew recently. He understood the rules but not the tactics. Honestly, with him able to play games like C&C Ancients, Ingenious, and Carcassonne, I don't see this getting any more play. Probably should put it on the sell/trade pile.

04.14.2011 Lighter than Lost Cities in the sense that math isn't necessary to play.  I rather enjoyed it but it is definitely on the simpler side - which is good, because I got it to play with my 6yo daughter.

RATING: 8
A nice two-player card game. The decisions are interesting, as you have to balance making points with minimizing the chances of your opponent to score big points.

It happens quite often that one pile gets really big, for example the discarded soldiers and archers and then it depends very much on luck of the draw. The one who draws the necessary number of ships first gets all the points. But knowing this is already half the game: unless you draw very badly you can prepare for this situation.

As in most card games bad draws happen, in this game it's not about drawing good or bad cards (both players have the same deck) but about the right timing. Some games are not as tense as I would wish because one player draws the right cards at the right time while the other player is forced to feed him points, but that happens only once in a while.

My opinions are mixed on this one. It seemed a little like a more complex version of Rock Paper Scissors, where each field influences another and you have little control over what happens on the board. For that reason, it was hard to strategize at all and the whole thing seemed kind of random. 

On the other hand, the game did have an amusing push-your-luck element in terms of deciding how long to wait before picking up a pile of cards, or figuring out which cards to play when, so as a gambling game it's pretty fun.

A very simple card game that still manages to be unlike any other game I've played.  You basically place a card on the board, thus capturing other cards according to what the board says that particular type of card is allowed to capture.  Capturing cards scores you points according to the numbers on the cards you captured, and most points scored wins.

You can explain the game in minutes, and complete and entire game in maybe 10 minutes.  Simple and fun!

Featherlight, almost relaxing game with one of the strongest fantasy thematic expressions I've seen (to note, I find flavourtext and art does nothing for me when it comes to thematic expression).

Dragonheart is a fast, easy, two-player card game.

Players play cards to different areas of the board, collecting points by playing the right card to collect a stack of others.  For example, playing an enchantress will allow you to claim any treasure chests that have been played, or claim the petrified dragon token -- which allows you to have an extra card in your hand.  Playing a troll will allow you to collect enchantress cards.  Playing 2 knights will slay the troll.  And so on...

Strategy is subtle, and the game comes down to knowing what cards you can play to collect the most points while minimizing the chance of your opponent being able to claim them.

Dragonheart is a two player card game very much in the same vein as Lost Cities, Battle Line, Jaipur, etc. With this game each player has their own identical deck, and they alternate playing one or more card of the same type. Certain card types "capture" other card types, and a board in the middle shows the relationships between the cards.

After one play, I like it. I'm not sure about the strategy... is this just a slot machine that plays the players? What are the tactics you can use? But one play is enjoyable enough to encourage me to try this some more.

I just love this game, but I'm having trouble describing my reasoning.  It just clicks with me as a very light confrontation game for two players.

What makes the game unique is the interplay of the cards in the player decks and the number of each card available.  Nearly every card can capture you points, but it's not without risk.  Sure you can put out a 4-point treasure chest to capture with a Sorceress on your next turn.  But how do you know your opponent won't pull out a White Dragon to grab it first?

Anticipating the other person's moves and knowing when it's safe to put out a good card for the taking is what makes this a clever little game.  Very simple and easy to teach, I'm ready to get this into my collection right away.

RATING: 8.5
Immediately playable. This is a quick filler game that's lots of fun to play. There's a back and forth between players that happens naturally without any downtime. This is one of those "special" games that doesn't feel forced. It's simple yet engaging.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Very fast filler. Strategies are almost (but not quite) nonexistent. Even tactics seem fairly limited compared to the luck of the draw. The main places to make choices are: Do I complete that region, and can I get the ships to sail at the right time? But those are overwhelmed by the luck of the draw.

A simple-enough game for two that will kill half an hour before you know it!  One must learn to make note of the cards already played and try to mitigate the luck involved with the card draw of their opponent.  There's also a good solo variant on the game's page here on the Geek.

Dragonheart gives you a lot of play options.  It's a nice variation on a trick taking game.  A good filler to mix up the routine.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm still trying to figure out if the goal is to maximize the number of points you take or minimize the number of points the other player gets.  Either way, there is enjoyable back-and-forth play that involves some tough decision-making.  For example, you can play a Treasure hoping to claim it with your Dragon during your next turn, but your opponent has the chance to take it for himself/herself with a Sorceress/Dragon.  But if they do claim it with a Sorceress, then you can always take their Sorceress with your Troll.

There are times where the games are influenced heavily by what cards you draw, but that happens in all card games, so it's not that big of a deal.  Even if a game is lopsided, you can always play another, as each game plays in about 10 minutes or so.  

Overall, this is a fun, quick, non-brain-burning game that I enjoy with friends as well as at coffee with my wife.

A nice, fast, light hearted 2 player game, that can be cranked out in less than 10 minutes...including set up and clean up. 

You will not enjoy this game if luck of the draw bothers you in determining the winner of the game.  In other words, the most skilled player will not necessarily win...

There is skill in knowing how many of each card exists, and how many your opponent has played...beyond this...

RATING: 6
Played this about 5 times in person and it plays just like the online versions on BGA and Yucata. It's a cute little game but I don't really feel like there is a place for it in my collection. I have some really good fantasy games already. I have really good fillers. I have really good lighter games that play well with 2. In the end it just didn't do anything special enough to stay. Happy enough to play it in future if someone wants to, or to play online on occasion, but no need to own it.

I learned and played this game online at Board Game Arena. There is some skill in hand management, but on the whole you need to be lucky with card draws and have the right cards available at the right time. It's a fun enough 5-10 minute time killer which I play occasionally, and if I got it in a trade or as a present I'd not mind playing in person. However I wouldn't actively seek it out to buy or trade for. Might be good to play with, or as a present for children.

Rather boring game, it seemed nice at the first 1-2 plays, after that you really feel luck is too important factor. There is a strategy factor too, but really lucks feels, at least for me, more important than any strategy you can make: if you continue to draw "score" cards and your opponent the right "capture" cards, you can't win.

Gorgeous, beautiful board--and it is what I expect from the artist Michael Menzel, one of my favorite board game artists. I collect his illustrated games, even if the play is rated as just so-so here on BGG.

But this is another 2-player Kosmos card game I am happy to have, and not just for the artwork.

Even though this game has some strategy, it is light and its non-combative nature, attractiveness, 8+ ages, and short play time (20-30 mins) strengthens its value as a family game.

RATING: 7
Before buying I thought your opponent would often simply play the card beating your previous one, resulting in not many cards staying long on the board. But I'm glad I was wrong. The spots where several cards are needed to capture, them getting prey themselves or disappearing when full and the fact you can play more of the same kind each time turns this into a more tactical game than I thought. Of course there is quite some luck involved, but it sure is a 2-player game my girlfriend and I enjoy playing a lot.

Dragonheart is a rather elaborate game of chicken that is dominated by the luck of the draw. To score points you first have to seed the board with score cards but your opponent then always has the first shot at claiming them. Therefore it comes down to hoping he just doesn't have the right hand at the moment, or guessing he does and trying to lure him into committing early. There is, however, hardly anything to base this decision on.

I enjoy Dragonheart quite a bit.  It's got a lot of luck to it but it's the kind of push-your-luck game where you have to figure out what your opponent might do as well, and you can sort of manipulate your opponent to go after one stack of points while you try to get more points on the other end.  For a light card game, there's enough meat on this Dragon bone!

This is a very fun, very quick game. Strategy is light enough to be fun, without the game feeling totally arbitrary.
Very nice art and board design, as well.
Now sure, there's a good amount of luck in whether your opponent has the right cards to screw you in a given turn. But hey, it's a short enough game that it doesn't matter much.
Highly competitive players may prefer to do a best 2 out of 3, or even 3 out of 5 series. The game's fast enough that this would probably be about an hour, but the luck could even out.

Addendum (2/4/2017)-  a few more plays and I have upped my rating just a little bit.  I initially found it a little too chaotic feeling, but realize now the "dump" points to hold off with draws.  And there is a little gambling on what your opponent may have in hand.

Nice 2-player card game. You place cards onto different piles on teh game board. Arrows connect one pile to another. When you place a card on a pile, you get to take the pile that it connects to and add it to your score pile. The game plays quickly, have very few rules, and the components are nice. Not terribly thematic, but still worth playing, repeatedly.

Lighter than the best games in the Kosmos two-player series, but a nice filler, in which you play cards on the board to capture other cards that are already there. These interactions of the cards have a bit of theme, but the attempt at telling a story is laughable: one player is trying to release the dragon from the spell and the other wants to prevent that, but both play exactly the same way and accomplish their goal by having more victory points than the opponent. The gameplay features a little of risk and hand managements, but there is also quite some luck of the draw and possibly a balance issue, as sometimes the knights and hunters just accumulate waiting for the lucky player who can play his boats first.

Dragonheart is a fantasy-themed take on a Casino-style card game, where players either play cards down to the shared tableau or they capture cards previously played to the tableau.

However, in this game, unlike Casino, the cards are more or less even in end value, and it is the overall number of cards taken (with an additional modifier) which determines the winner.

Also, most cards have interlinked benefits beyond capturing similar cards, so there is some timing and interplay between the players around when (and when not) to play certain cards.

That said, I found it a pleasant, lighter weight game I could easily play with my family members.

Each player has a similar deck of cards with a different back, from which they draw and replenish their hands.

Ship cards played to the table serve as a timer to the end of the hand; cards left unplayed in a player's deck are counted with cards captured for final scoring.

The artwork is attractive fantasy fare, but other than rationalizing why one card affects another the theme is fairly slim.

In the end, Dragonheart is a double-solitaire card game; if you like these and you also like fantasy and lighter games this may be just your ticket (to ride).

I think I like the game.  The theme is solid.  The two-player card-driven mechanic is good.

However, ultimately feels very luck driven.  Sometimes my hand of cards feels like it plays itself (given limited viable options).

I'll probably play it several more times (particularly since there is a very nice implementation at yucata.de), but not convinced that it is a 'better' game than BattleLine, Balloon Cup or Shanghaien.

Dragonheart is based on rock-paper-scissors with card playing mechanics. The best parts of the game is simple rules and fast game progress. The game is easy to learn.

Very simple but nevertheless enjoyable to play. Great for playing while having a nice conversation! The theme is strong, though not really reflected too well in the mechanics. I really feel like I'm part of the game's world, watching the story play out, though. I really enjoy it.

Initial Rating: 8.5 (September 2011)

I like light card games, and Dragonheart fulfilled me for a while, however as I´m over 20 plays I find the luck factor to be annoyingly high. I still like the game, it is easy to teach, it plays very quick and serves well as a filler.

The art is very cool, sadly its theme is paper thin and it is a shame because Dragons always make for a good theme.

For now I continue to have fun with it, but I suspect it will continue to go down in my ratings, mainly due to the high random factor.

Current Rating: 7.5

After many more plays, Dragonheart has continue to slide down in my personals ratings. I have good memories playing it, but it is now time to move on. I sold my copy of the game and I’m downgrading its rating. Still a good rating from me.

I will only play this online, or I friend request it. 

Current Rating: 6.0

We prefer this over Lost Cities - fast, and still has some strategy. Also, there are no penalties as in Lost Cities. The only negative is my wife has destroyed me every time we've played.

RATING: N/A
Great two player game.  Has only been played once.  I bought this in hopes that my wife would play with me, but that was a failure.  I rarely play outside of my gaming group, so two player games don't see much action around my house.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
There's a game there, mostly a hand management/risk management game, but it's not very deep and quite luck driven. I think there's a much better game in there trying to get out, but it needs a changing or reconfigurable board or something. 

Also, the card art is just copied from the board.

Pros:
- Simple, short
- *One* nice piece of artwork. (Or three, counting the card back and figurine...)

Cons:
- Luck driven, not hugely interesting
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
First impression: I enjoy this 2 player game. It's a lot like Lost Cities and Battle Line, but slightly more complicated. It forces you to gamble on what the other player might have, and has some really tough decisions. It kind of boils down to playing the card you think will help your opponent the least until you have the cards you need to score points.

Update: Not a lot to say except that I've played Dragonheart many times now, and I still really enjoy it.

This game always works. I have play it with many different players, and everyone like it. I also much like the theme, and the artwork is great. A fast, simple two player game. One of my best purchases ever (Essen 2010). Still playing this often, many years after.

As a quick, light 2-player game, this is pretty damn fine. Lots of luck, but in the good tension producing way. Expect some pretty big swings in scores, but a fun way to pass 20 minutes...and then probably another 20 minutes...and then another....gah, had been playing the dragon cards wrong (they don't take the dragon statue, the spear lady does...better game with the right rules).

I actually liked this game a whole lot but the gameplay does get repetitive after awhile such that I don't much feel like playing it anymore.  Since I can play it online if I ever got the itch I'd probably just do that but with so many other games to explore it's unlikely I'll go back to this one.  I definitely can beat any new player far more often than I might lose but I'm not sure that I figured out for sure if there was anything more than luck to determine the winner between any 2 more experienced players that know the basic mistakes not to make.

An original and straightforward two-player hand management game, but lacking in depth and teeth. The general idea is you play one or more identical cards from your hand to the matching area on the board. Cards have a victory point value that you get if you take them from the board by playing cards under the right circumstances to another nearby are of the board. Generally this happens when you fill the last slot in a region or any time you play a one or more cards to the appropriate region.

Generally you jump on any scoring opportunity that presents itself (modulo obviously setting up your opponent for an even larger score) and when none present themselves you cycle cards by playing to an area that isn’t close to being cashed in. Sometimes you will want to pass on a small payoff in order to build it up with some of your own cards, or in hopes you opponent will sweeten the pot, since the game end condition does put some pressure on maximizing your score per card played, but this is easily grasped too.

Drachenherz isn’t *bad*, but it is rather bland, uninspired and shallow. It’s certainly unworthy of the designer of Traders of Genoa and Goa. Better options in this vein are Lost Cities (and possibly some of the Keltis spinoffs), Parade and, if you want extra meaty fillers, Schotten-Totten. Heck, I might even suggest Blue Moon as broadly similar.

Note: this game has not been released by Fantasy Flight Games yet, but it is available to play online courtesy Bretspielwelt

Played only on Yucata and Boardgamearena and it is OK. Very light game of play cards and hope your opponent doesn't play the one you don't want him to. But there is a great deal of luck and it is very swingy - if you drew that boat one turn earlier you got a 20 point pay off but because you didn't, your opponent got it. And now you have 3 boats and no way to score points off them.
Fine for a filler I suppose but there are others I like better and I expected more from Dorn.

I've read several comments comparing this to Knizia's Lost Cities, but the similarities are superficial: Kosmos 2-player card-laying games with a pasted-on theme. (Speaking of cosmetic similarities, the dragon figure is from [geekurl=/image/1873608]Blue Moon[/geekurl].)

The irregular distribution and point schedule is a disadvantage to infrequent players unless they refer to a chart. The RPS-like network on the board is neat.

I suspect this game would be better received if everyone expected a game for kid vs kid.

This game is a light, fast, somewhat fun 2 player game.  I've been desiring to expand my 2 player only collection of games, and this one fills that 10 minute void in between heavier games.  This game is higher on the luck scale as what you draw really determines what you can play.  It's sort of like the game War mixed with Paper, Rock, Scissors, but with the cards having variable powers.  Even though the game is high luck, over many plays, the game will favor the more strategic player who can make the most efficient move.

Dragonheart is a good enough game, but it's not as good as other games with a similar profile.

There's a dash of luck, but plenty of strategy; the artwork is great; and the mechanics are interesting. Setting up future plays (and gambling you'll be able to be the one who takes advantage of the setup), exerting control over when the game ends, and trying to outguess and outmaneuver your opponent are Dragonheart's highlights.

Fun, straight forward filler that plays fast enough to keep the interest level high. At it's heart, it's a trick-taking game, but with multiple tricks available at any one time. Cards played to gain one trick become fodder for future tricks. Players want to win the best trick they can, but at the same time not put down cards that give their opponent an even better trick afterwards. There is also a fair amount of risk-reward play, which gives the player mini-victories that add to the fun. Better than expected, and right on par with my favorite light, 2P games.

After being spanked in my first 3 games of this I thought that it was a rubbish luckfest. But it was also somehow addictive and when I started playing a lot more conservatively I became competitive. I not sure what it is about the game that makes me want to keep playing; it could be the decision making whether that is selecting the least bad card from your hand, or do I push my luck now, or which stack of points to capture; or it could be the quick play time so that even if you lose there seems time to dive back into another game.

Kellemes csalódás volt, nem vártam tőle annyit, mint amennyit végül hozott.

Jóval több taktikai finomságot rejt a játék, mint elsőre gondolná az ember. A sárkányos téma is passzol hozzá, a kivitelezése pedig kifejezetten szépre sikerült (mondjuk Menzeltől ezt el is lehet várni).

Tökéletes kis filler, egyetlen hátránya, hogy Rüdiger Dorn (aki az Istanbul tervezője is egyébként) nem csinált belőle több játékos verziót (csak ketten lehet, esetleg nem hivatalos szóló módban).

A new addition to the Kosmos 2-player range in 2010, Dragonheart is a fun experience but not as challenging as other titles in the series. 

Dragonheart is really all about timing and hand management as each card can be played to the central board to acquire other cards of a given type, which then earn a player points in their score pile. 

Unlike many games in the Kosmos range, close scores are not always assured here and this can be put down to differences in playing experience but also the draw of the cards, which sometimes leave a player in a pickle they can't get out of. 

Good but not great.

Contender to break into the 2-player rotation with the wife, though the theme may be an issue.  Unclear how much is driven by luck of the card draw vs. well-played cards, but seems to be a defense-first game.  Art is fantastic.  Gameplay is simple and quick to teach - follow the arrows!

Have mistaken the dwarf and troll cards on several occasions...

Redundant laying down cards to various spots that sometimes allows you to pick up cards from another spot that earn you points.  This game felt uninspired to me, the decisions were pretty much left up to what was in your hand and what will not allow your opponent to get points.

RATING: 8
Fantastic two-player card game that can be played in 5-10 minutes. It seems like there are more countervailing tensions to mitigate the luck factor in this title than in other card games. You need your opponent to fall into your trap or not have the play you are about to play; that element of risk pricing adds a freshness to the luck of the draw. I'm a little iffy on the story but appreciate the theme.

RATING: 3
It's not a very bad game, it is quite balanced, but it's very important to memorize the cards and I don't enjoy this kind of games. Once you do, it's just a question of deciding what cards you keep and which one you let go.

It's definitly a light game, but it's deeper than people thinks. The proof is that I'm winning 4 of every 5 games I play at Yucata.de and there are more people with similar stats.

The theme is a joke, it's a pure abstract game.

Said this, the implementation on Yucata.de makes the game look much better. It memorizes the cards and does the administration for you. It's one of the very few games that plays out better online.

It's debatable whether this peculiar little card game has its roots in skill or whether it really is all luck of the draw. But it does seem to reward those who can manage their hand and it is undoubtedly beneficial to understand the card distribution. The muddy artwork and naff theme don't really help matters.

RATING: 7
Drawing from identical decks, players play cards to a common area to capture cards previously played there, and in turn leaving the capturing cards up there for future capture themselves. There are 8 different types of cards, and each can be captured in different ways - for treasure, 1 fire-dragon is enough, but trolls require 2 heroes for example. By watching what your opponent has previously played, your objective is to place cards that are unlikely to be captured if you can, or at least of low value, maybe planning to get them on your next turn yourself if you have the right type. Not always easy to do with a handsize of 5 though. The game is pleasant, spouse friendly, easy to learn, fast to play, has a nice watchfulness about it, nice graphics. It's all about hand management. There's not a lot of tension - you've either got it or you don't when the good stuff is up for grabs, though hopefully you've planned for it. My reservation is that each game could be much the same as the first, limiting replay. Still, it's decent enough enjoyment through the initial plays.

RATING: 6
Really nice fun and quick game. Looks really nice, has cool components. They used the dragon mold of Blue Moon :) so this is the 7th dragon I got! 3 from blue moon, 3 from BMCity and this one. The game mechanic is neat, you are forced to play at least one card per turn, and sometimes you can't play anything really useful, some other times (hopefully most of the times) you can, hover, regardless of which, you always play a card that can be useful to your opponent, this creates some nice tension and anticipation. Nice.

after some time playing this, I downrated it to 5.5. it's too luck driven for my taste, sometimes players are simply stuck with no chance of turning it around...

This is a really interesting little card-game.  It's not difficult to play, but without the visual of the board, I think it would be impossible to explain what-takes-what, so I guess that means it's a somewhat convoluted trick-taking game.  But it plays smoothly and quickly.  Another fun entry in the Kosmos 2-player line.

Played this on BGA. I am glad that I tried out the digital version before I made a purchase of a physical copy. It used to be on my list and now I am just happy that I have saved $17 on it. 

This is a very light game. Someone on BGG described it as a fancy rock-paper-scissor and I kind of agree with him. The bad thing about it is that it's a card game and you might end up with less than favorable hand to begin with. The good thing about it is that the 2 decks between the 2 players are identical so you can plan somewhat with that by knowing how many cards of a certain type are still left in your deck and vise versa. It is pretty light and it does give a bit of tension not knowing if your opponent can sabotage your plans. I would play this game if I don't have access to Lost Cities or Battle Line. It is a fun game, to play with non-gamers.

Simple card game mechanics for a quick game. There is a bit of strategy, but the random order of the cards can alter your results substantially. The goal is to play  the board to your advantage and bide your time forcing your opponent to increase the pot for a particular area while you reap the benefits. I found out that the ship pots are probably the best, but I have to play more to find out for sure.

Dragonheart is good for a couple's game or a relatively light filler, but it's not something I'd want to play all the time because it gets repetitive pretty quickly. There's a reasonably high luck factor, because if you don't draw Stone Dragons or Mages for the first half of the game, you're pretty screwed if your opponent gets the dragon token early on.

A fantastic, simple, quick filler. Perfect for rolling out for 1/2 an hour once the baby is asleep. The theme is a little tacked on, but how the cards interact makes perfect sense, and the theme does make it more enjoyable than playing with a basic set of numbered cards.

You can be screwed with a bad hand, but there is a certain amount of skill involved in card play, and luring your opponent into taking low-value cards so you can subsequently take better cards.

Dragonheart is a two-player card game of indirection.  Each player starts out with an identical deck of cards, distinguished by color; each player shuffles his or her deck then draws a hand of 5 cards.  Between the two players is a board with 10 different areas, each area set aside for a different type of card, and each area indicating how many cards can be played until it is full and its action triggered resulting in a different area of cards added to the player's score pile.  Each turn players take turn playing as many cards of a single type as they desire (providing there is room on the board), they then score cards if they trigger an action, then finally draw cards from their private deck until their hand is full.  At the end of the game the player with the highest score wins.

During the game each player must decide where to play his or her cards on the board.  Some areas require more than one card before scoring, others a single card, and one area will never trigger, but allows a player to stack up a large amount of points to later capture.  The game is symmetric, which adds to the tension, because each player knows the other player has the same opportunities; a card played in preparation for later scoring might be scored by your opponent on the following turn.  The game plays fast (15-20 minutes) and has elements of playing your opponent as well as playing the game, as you are constantly guessing what your opponent will play next.  It's a game of give and take with hidden depth.

Addictive couple's game in the same vein as other great ones in this category as [i]En Garde[/i] and [i][url=http://www.juegosdemesacr.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=70&Itemid=1]Battle Line[/url][/i]. Players lay down cards primordially to pick up others to get points, but at the same time the cards played stay in the board as points to be caught for their rival, using a kind of scissors, paper, rock mechanic, as some cards can be used to get some others and a third kind can be used to pick the first, among other effects.  Nice, quick and easy to learn game.

A simple game for 2 players -- really, a very quick filler (on BSW, at least). The board is great: nice art, and pretty much all the rules are represented in a clean, simple way. Gameplay is pretty random, though, with a lot of luck in the card draw. Still, the game is so quick, and there is at least _some_ hand management, that the luck isn't so horrible.

A nice little filler, but nothing I need to own.

--- Summary ---
Each player has an identical deck of cards showing pictures matching board locations, and point values 1-4. On your turn, play as many matching cards of a single type as you want (with limits for certain types); each may result in you collecting previously placed cards -- all pretty obvious from the arrows on the board. The dragon hunters and warriors, after collecting their prize, go to a discard pile; these are themselves collected when the third ship is played; the game ends (even turns) after the 9th ship. Score VP for all the cards you've collected.

My rating went down half a point, I think it a very fun, light game but the luck factor is undeniably very high, I had games where I literally had no chance due to bad luck with the cards. I do enjoy it nevertheless, solid 7 therefor, but it is nothing I feel the need to own.

And the mechanics of how to score this stuff are very interesting/innovative. So there's really a number of areas that this game is very promising in: mechanics, innovation, fills a need. However, so far it seems rather luck dependent, on when you draw the right cards. Perhaps this is because it's two player and you know the deck composition so the card counting sort of reins you in. Ive only played it maybe 8 or 10 times, so this rating could change.

RATING: 7.8
A fun, quick, light game of short term tactics that probably doesnt have much staying power for me. The Board and Card artwork is great and the gameplay works well with the theme (despite being 'pasted on'). At the moment Im enjoying playing the occasional game with Sophie (9) - she enjoys it alot! There's just not enough here for long term replay value I think - time will tell (20/8/11)

Beautifully done update to a trick taking game. Fast-pasted with no brain burn but certain enough strategic choices to keep it interesting. I would say this is better than Lost Cities for this type of light 2-player.

„Serce Smoka”, czyli… mało a dużo. 

Plusy: 
1. Grafiki 
2. Solidne wydanie 
3. Cena 
4. Banalne zasady 
5. Figurka smoka odporna na uszkodzenia 

Minusy: 
1. Hmmm… trudno powiedzieć. 

„Serce Smoka” to prosta karcianka, jej losowość moim zdaniem nie jest minusem, ale z taką opinią się spotkałem. To bardzo dobra, szybka gra dla 2 graczy, która świetnie sprawdza się jako rozgrzewka w czasie oczekiwania na resztę graczy i rozłożeniem cięższego kalibru. Gra bardzo pozytywnie mnie zaskoczyła. Polecam 7/10

MI I will only play this with the bonus 2 card variant.  Otherwise the luck is out of control and it's not fun for the person "with no luck."  Variant:  Take 7 cards to start.  Pull out 2, look at them, and set them aside face down.  At any time each player may draw from their personal set of 2 instead of from the normal draw pile.  Much much better... Thanks, somebody, for the variant. It's on here.

A fairly simple card game that gives players a bit of room to maneuver, but too often actions are very constrained by what you are able to draw, and when. A harmless way to pass the time, but don't look for great depth or challenge here ...

One of my favorite two player fillers. Simple, fast, and fun. Maybe too light for some people, but that's what makes it great for when you just want something casual, or maybe something to play after an intense brain-burner.

Update: In some ways it's a lot like a lighter Battleline: you try to hang on to useful cards to make a big score later, while playing cards that will hopefully not help your opponent. Sometimes you can lose because of bad card draws, but the game is quick enough to play best of three.

Vom Niveau her ähnlich wie Lost Cities, wobei sogar noch leichter ist. Bei LC konnte man noch ein wenig zocken, ein wenig versuchen mit Taktik zu spielen, musste Wetten eingehen, etwas riskieren. Drachenherz spielen ist im Prinzip einfach nur Karten ablegen die gerade passen und hoffen das dabei n paar Punkte rumkommen.

RATING: 6.5
Incredibly nice looking cardgame that scratches the same (quick light filler) itch as Lost Cities. For once, the playing time indication on the box is pretty accurate: Most of our games only take about 15 minutes. Despite the artwork, I do like Lost Cities a bit better, because the score multipliers in that game really add to the tension. Still, Drachenherz is a highly recommended game if you like simple, pure hand management games (like me). The fact that both players have their own similar deck to draw from also makes it different enough from Lost Cities to warrant having both in your collection.

(12.27.10 After 3 games)  A Dorn design that plays quickly and is about hand management.  Light, quick game play.  Easy to explain and detemine what cards which cards for points.  I expect that there will be more card counting as we become more familiar with the game - hopefully it will allow for more replayability.

Rated after three games. This is a fast and rather simple two player game with quite a big amount of luck. I lost all three, so it can't be all luck, right?

On his turn the player plays card(s) on the board and may be scores points or not. The trick is that cards can be played on specific areas and based on other cards on the board, the played card might score you points or not.

There's lots of dragons, trolls, dwarfs, heroes and heroines and of course treasures.

RATING: 6
This is either a subtle game of hand management, or a game that rewards someone who draws the right card at the right time.  Given the current rating of the game, I'm inclined to think it's the former, but based on the three games I've played so far, it feels like it's the latter.  It's probably somewhere in the middle of those two extremes.  I'm sure there are certain tactics to play during the game under certain circumstances, but how many plays will it take before I know what they are?  It's enjoyable enough, but it can feel awfully frustrating when you have a handful of cards that either don't help you, or could set your opponent up for collecting a nice set.

RATING: N/A
Dragons, knights, trolls, princesses, dwarves and other fantasy characters make up the world of Drachenherz. Dragons are searching for treasure, of course, but they're being pursued by dragon hunters, and those are the two sides that face off in this game. On a turn, a player plays one or more cards with the same motif, then refills his hand to five cards. The cards are always played onto the part of the gameboard that has the same motif. By laying out cards, one collects point cards that are already present. This is how a dragon collects treasure cards – but the third dragon hunter defeats the dragon, while a second knight protects the princess. Other combinations await the players, and whoever collects the most points wins.

I like it. The art work is nice and it is simple to play. Games are short. At the first play I did not get any decent cards in the beginning, but it worked it's way around later in the game. Yeah, it's luck at what cards you draw out of your stack, but some how it can work out later. When do you play only 1 card or throw out 2-3 cards to be able to draw back up to 5 or 6 if you have the dragon.

Pros: Pretty art, portable, no attacking. Cons: Mostly pasted-on theme (and not a very original theme at that) and highly luck-based. If I want a quick, small footprint two-player card game, I'm much more likely to pick Lost Cities or Morels.

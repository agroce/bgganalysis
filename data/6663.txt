    This is another great addition to the crayon games.  The disaster cards are quite unique, and add a lot of fun.  I particularly like the train upgrades which have more variety than those of other games.  The only difficulty involves the poorer quality of crayons, and the map color which makes drawn lines less visible.

Based on a a single session with experienced crayon rail games players, I can say that i like this game a lot, however, I highly recommend reading and learning the rules well before embarking on this one! Also would help to get a feel for the locations of the cities and such.

We like the optional extra-card rule an dplay without track-destroying events. Fun, but not knowing where the cities are makes planning a little harder than a "real" setting. Also , commodity chips are not helpful, we just write down what we are carrying.

I enjoy all of the crayon rails.  Play with the public locking variant if you want a more balanced and strategic game.  The wrap-around board is cool, and despite what some people say, it's not hard to grasp.  I also like the optional low-gravity rule where you go 1 milepost faster for each empty load space on your train.  There are some wicked events like solar flares that force you to take refuge in the nearest city for a turn or two.  According to my old National Geographic moon map, the board layout & topography is pretty accurate.  In Lunar Rails, low $$ payouts and expensive terrain make for a long game... I think the wrap-around board causes low payouts (since it tends to bring supply & demand sites nearer to each other).

Very difficult but fun crayon rail game.  The geography is insane!  The one time I played there were two disasters that happened in a row - one required you to get to a city or lose your loads, the other melted a bunch of tracks which hosed the other players and I cruised on to victory (and is probably why we haven't played since).

This is a good game that would be much better if the events in the deck were more balanced in their effects. Some are simply too impactful for a race/efficiency game that goes 3 to 4 hours (in a shorter game, they would be more forgivable).

Comment from Iron Dragon:

I don't understand the appeal of any of the crayon rail games, on turn 2 someone was eliminated because a bridge was washed out in front of him and you are not allowed to turn around and he had no money to rebuild (it was only the second turn) and so that was it, he was out. The end game was sort fun, but the 4 hrs it took to get there was worse than getting teeth pulled, I will NEVER play one of these games again!

I found this game quite fun, and will write up a full review soon.  We still have several rule clarification questions though, the rules could have been clearer.  I like the drop-off/delivery mechanisms though one of the other players preferred crayon rail games without them.  The game was longish, we played 4 hours and weren't finished but much of that was newbie syndrome.

It seems to be a general consensus on the Geek that this is the best of the Mayfair Games "crayo-rails" games.  I would concur - mostly.  We played this with 4 people, and it took almost 3.5 hours!  I can't ever remember any other of these games taking more than 2 - not even Euro Rails.
I think this is a little more difficult than any of the other versions, especially with the wrap-around feature for both sides of the Moon.

The "Rails" system reaches the moon, around a hundred years into the future.  Intuitive link up system allows players to play on a sphere.  Good play aids allow players to find those pesky craters easily enough.  Nice touches with the historical landing/impact sites of the various landers and probes.  Game play seems solid (tons of mountains!), with random meteor impacts adding chaos into the mix.  I like the look of the "spike" and "gravity" optional rules.

RATING: 6
Rating is for 2-player variant with 4 cards and two trains.  Rating for any other format would be a 5.   Very long and repetitive game, even with a bunch of shortcuts, but I wanted to have a game from this genre in my collection.  Requires a lot of thought and calculation, and when a meteor strike hits you hard in three places at once, you'll probably wonder why you did all that math in the first place.  The included crayons are awful, but I hear China Markers (grease pencils) work great.

[2 plays] I love the crayon rails in general, and this one is no exception.  When we saw the cratered and mountainous terrain of the moon, I thought this board would be horribly tight, but it's not, probably because there are so many cities so close together.  The moon definitely puts an enjoyable new twist on things, though I am still learning to think in the right three-dimensional way.  We're thinking of trying a combo variant--for instance, start with conventional Russian Rails, and when you have sufficient millions, go to the Cosmodrome, build a spaceship, and blast off to the moon and play Lunar Rails.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Way too much downtime in a 5 - 6 player game. Love it with 2 players. Want to try 3 player soon. 

Make sure to give every player a cheat sheet with the location of the resources and cities. It's available in the file download section and also in the middle of the rule book if you don't mind taking the rules apart or making your own copies.

We always play with a vinyl sheet on top of the map and use wet-erase markers for the routes. You can find these vinyl sheets in fabric stores (it's usually somewhere with table cloth). Don't go for the too thin stuff or it will not cling to the map nicely.

Not sleeved. (Won't) Tight box fit without sleeves

Not the best of the crayon rails series (in my opinion) because the terrain is so brutal it almost doesn't matter.  But it's one of my wife's favorites, so I've played it quite a few times.

Smacks of Railroad Tycoon, with longer play, more fiddley, and with less player confrontation.  Also, if a person makes mistakes at the beginning or gets bad draws, it is hard to catch up.

We had quite some fun with that one. You have to plan carefully your routes not to end up stuck in the middle of nowhere on an unfinished railroad. You're always studying the board, mentally creating your routes and fine-tuning your plans. Two important flaws : the event cards are just random take-that things that add nothing to the game, and more problematic for me, there is close to no interaction at all. Honestly, apart from a few moments in the game, you might as well all be playing on different boards.

It's the crayon rail game where you can build around the world, well, the moon.  The biggest addition to to Empire Builder rules is the map points where you exit and enter the other half of the board.

Yet another variation on Empire Builder, but with another twist! The moon is represented near-side and the far-side as two circular map areas. The edges of each map "connect" to the other map, making for some intriguing route building. The only problem is that this map layout does not accurately depict travel on a spherical surface. Routes along the equator are far more expensive than along the upper and lower longitudes. This makes Lunar Rails a bit tougher and more punishing than Martian Rails. If one can get past this minor quibble, the map has some fantasy locations, with names that pay homage to some historically notable science-fiction figures. It's a solid '8'.

I am sure my rating will go up over time, but for now I am smarting from getting stomped on.  3 hours in and I get hit by a Meteor Shower AND a Cosmic Rays.  The shower took out my track in the direction I was headed and the rays destroyed my two loads.  I had 2M dollars and couldn't build.  Ouch!

The geography and the events make this game significantly harder that others we have played.  The game elements are unique enough to make the game worth a look if you are familiar with the other Rails games, but beware... this game has a bite!

Edit: Our third 2 player game was smoother.  The geography and events are still nasty, but out experience kept us out of too much trouble.  Despite my thinking I was way behind it was a very close game - with me losing out by 1 turn.

Most of the games in the Empire Builder line seem to add a feature or two not present in the original. This one features a wraparound board (very cool) and the expanded loco expansions originally introduced in Iron Dragon (also a nice feature). I have played most releases in the series, but haven't played any one of them a lot. In my limited experience, this one seems to offer a wider variety of potential routes to take because of the wraparound, and might be the one that stays freshest longest. There are two slight downsides for me: the lunar setting is less appealing to me than those based on real geographies and real cities (personal preference), and the color choice for the map makes it harder to see where the crayon lines.

This is definitely the most brutal Empire Builder game I've played.  Most of the terrain is mountains, so getting anywhere significant can be quite a challenge on a limited budget.  Frequent asteroid strikes that can happen anywhere on the board exacerbate the problem, as they take out a large radius of rail lines when they strike.  This is the only crayon rail I've played where I felt like survival is a worthy accomplishment.

The second most unique crayon rails game, including:
- a clever wrap-around map with both halves of the moon
- better train progression
- different terrain with craters

The main problem with these games is the length of time they take to play. This map contains lots of tough terrain, so it takes a long time to develop routes, making this one of the longer games in the series - although the faster trains help.

Despite the length, this is an enjoyable member of the series as it can be quite challenging to survive the tough events & come up with successful routes to turn a profit.

NOTE: "Honeymoon" variant exists for 2 players (involves removing one of each type of good & lowering connection limits to cities)

Feels different from the other games in the Empire Builder series.  It can be difficult to tell green from blue and red from brown due to the grey background.

RATING: 8
Another excellent 'crayon' rail game. The difficult terrain results in a slower developing game and it's necessary to keep building raillines ahead because it is quite possible to be able to move faster than the railhead can be advanced. The incremental train upgrades and links between sides of the moon both work.

Empire Builder involves at least an hour over the course of the game trying to locate the resources and cities on the map.  Lunar Rails makes that three hours, since they are all imaginary cities and resources.  Not fun at all.

Probably the most difficult map in the crayon game series. With all the difficult terrain it is easy to run out of money and have to start discarding hands. It is probably one of the slower developing game in the series. After a few more plays I may be raising the rating.

I don't mind the mountainous terrain as much as some people who've played it, although I do agree that it's a bit annoying and it makes the game take an extra unnecessary half hour.

The reason this game is rated so highly is because the crayon rails are just more fun on a globe.  Even if it is expensive to build your tracks.  A globe just adds options for strategic planning that you can't find in a smaller regional map.

Lunar Rails has the typical flaws of the crayon rail system: excessive down time, and events that exacerbate the down time by costing you turns.

I hear this game becomes playable with some modification, but the base game is terrible.  It is unforgiving of mistakes, which would be ok except that it has many random events that can completely ruin you and leave you not only unable to win, but unable to make any progress what-so-ever.

A bit harder than other crayon rail games, but that is not a bad thing.  It just takes more careful planning.  Plus the wrap-arounds are cool and offer a big advantage to this game that other crayon rails do not offer.  I also like the   additional variant rules.  Since the moon is a low gravity environment the variant rules make a lot of since and add different mechanics to the game.

Ben has Empire Builder, which I love with an unholy devotion. I thought this would be a nice next step, and it is, providing quite a challenge with expensive routes and totally unfamiliar geography. I think we'll get better at it with time, but I'm not convinced I'll ever like it as well as EB- the disasters can TOTALLY wipe you out, which is not fun. First game, Ben won with his requisite $250M- in contrast, I had $17M. Not $170M, $17M.

I think the wrap around board is neat, but the geography of this map is brutal.

I very much enjoyed this incarnation of the series.  It is certainly a more thought provoking game (for us) that the others in the series.  A lot of this is due to the almost completely mountainous terrain on the moon.  This means you have to be really careful where you build.  It can be really easy to run out of money.  We had more thrown in hands in this game than in multiple other versions combined.  Of course there is the additional factor of going off the edge of the map as well.  At any rate, I hope to get to play it more often.  Unfortunately, when I want a crayon rail game, I am not often in the mood for a game requiring this much thought.

Crayon railing on the moon?  FUN.  This is the hardest map for me to figure out where stuff is though.  Perhaps a few more plays can fix that?

Didn't like this as much as the other EBs. It was just too *tough* which makes the game last too long, and these are already long games.

Five is my standard rating for crayonrails games.  They are just too long for a game with no player intereaction.  Lunar Rails IS notable however...I almost gave it a worse rating because it's even more tedious:  every time I get a new card I have to look up three new places (because I don't know Lunar geography) PLUS there's the "where the hell do they make robots" problem.  However, in the end, since it was actually pretty interesting to learn lunar geography, I'll keep the rating at 5.

Again crayon rail game with economic delivery system and a few twists for terrain and thats fun.

Not the first rail building Mayfair game to play, however it is a really good one. I suggest playing the one that is your home country or area (US, Europe, Australia, Japan, China, India, Russia) first and then the others (Iron Dragon and Lunar). Lunar has a lot of mountains and craters that slow the growth a lot.

Have only played it once, but it's one of the best versions I've played. Playing on a spherical surface meant spending less time just moving the train around! Might rate higher if only it didn't take 3 hours to play!

I've now played four of the games in the "crayon rails" series and they are all excellent.  So far, this game was by far the most difficult because I had no idea at the start where any place was located, much less where to find the goods to deliver to those places.  The player aids included in the game help somewhat, but the start was pretty mind-boggling.  I enjoyed myself despite getting crushed in a 3 player game, so that's definitely a good sign.

I played the various crayon rail games when I returned to boardgaming back in 2000.  As I continued to play them, I found myself less interested in playing them.  Is it multiplayer solitaire ... perhaps.  They are okay games, just not great.  I would rather play something else.

A clever addition to the pantheon.  If you like the Mayfair Rails games, you should like this one.

A very nice Empire Builder game, with an interesting wrap-around map, a two-sided disc making do for a sphere. Moon landings and probe sites are noted on the board.

The backside of the moon is hard to play. Play can feel unbalanced.

My first crayon game, and while the game does tend to drag, some of my favorite play sessions have been around this game. Shout out to my moonbeam homies.

Harder to find locations than Iron Dragon (one of my favorite crayon-rail games) but has the coolness of laying train track on a sphere.

Along with Russian Rails, my least favorite of the Mayfair crayon rail games.  Unless everyone has played numerous times, or everyone is familiar with lunar geography, you spend too much time searching the map.  Bad events are too devastating.

Grey background makes the yellow crayon easier to see than on the other Empire Builder games.  I like the world-wrapping dynamic.

My second crayon rails game, and my second win in a row. I still don't think it's me. But I really dig the logistics of the game, min/maxing spending, and the random card draws keep it interesting. I was apprehensive about the naming and imaginary cities in regards to being able to find them, but it wasn't that bad. Not as good as playing on a map where you know where the cities are, but nowhere as easy as the naming convention for Iron Dragon. Neat game, but I think I edge towards liking Iron Dragon more.

Played once with 4 people - 2 who knew what they were doing.  We started at 8pm and at 1:30am had to call a time limit.  At that point 3 of us were connected to 7 major cities, but no one had over $75mil.  Seems like a very long and repetitive game.
Of course it would be quicker if everyone knew what they were doing and it didn't take minutes to look up the strange names and figure out where the resources were.

Enjoyed our first play and looking forward to another go. As a projection of a sphere the map seems a little odd to me, but as far as the gameplay is concerned it's fine.

Hunting around trying to find where the various locations are (since very few people are excessively familiar with the moon) really slows the game down.  Not a good choice for a first crayon-rail game.

The best combination of my two favorite themes! Rails and science fiction - the best of the crayon rail games in my opinion.

Standard rail game play. Board wrapping to simulate a sphere makes uninteresting change in play and strategy.

RATING: 4.5
I would rate this higher but for the fact that the fact that no one knows where any of the cities are and consequently the game takes longer than it should. If I was willing to play it enough to learn the locations of the fictitious lunar cities then I might give it a 6, but why would I want to make that kind of time investment when I could play, say, Empire Builder?

I like the compact map and playing on a sphere--which gives it a different feel from other crayon railroad games. Finding the unfamiliar city names slows the game down.

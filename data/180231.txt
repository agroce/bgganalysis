Pretty deep for a dice game.  Complex choices with dice colors and transformation and scoring.  I liked it, but it took quite a while to figure out how the mechanics worked together.  I'd call it a relative to [b]AquaSphere[/b], not a dice version of the game.  Clever pad setup!

RATING: 7
I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

OctoDice is a nice and quite portable dice game with some pretty unique mechanisms. While the dice rolling part might be nothing new under the sun, I quite enjoyed the fact that you get to copy other people's results and even more the many little different strategies that this game offers. Yet the coolest part of the game is, in my opinion, the technology tree, which is something that I wouldn't expect to find in a simple dice rolling game and also an element that grants quite a bit of replay-value.

OctoDice is therefore quite clever and also pretty easy to play, even if the rule explanation might not be as fast as for other games in the genre. I enjoyed more than I thought I would. Nice little filler!

I was pleasantly surprised when I started playing this game. I thought it was going to be too complex but no, it's really simple to get a grasp of. The best way to describe it would be... Yahtzee-like game with stronger conflicts of small-term gains over long-term strategy.

OctoDice somehow manages to be greater than the sum of its unpromising Yahtzee with a point salad parts.  The little tech tree and the possibility of using two of an opponent's dice are nice features.

The score pad sets out the multiple ways to score simply and clearly.  The art is uninteresting though functional.

OK as a roll & write game, but a tad too fiddly for my liking, can be quite prone to AP and with 4 players, overstays it welcome for the depth.

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
Reminds me a bit of Rolling Japan, but I liked the decisions in this one better.  The rulebook is a mess (at least the english one), and isn't very clear on some details, but once those get squared away on the forms the game should play pretty smooth.  The box is way to big for what is in the box, and that is a little disappointing since if it was in a smaller box, I would be more inclined to keep it (although I am still on the fence).  Want to try again once I get the rules squared away.

Man, I don't know what it is, but this is an awesome "roll and mark off the sheet" game. Variable setup, different strats, a pseudo tech tree, and a level or 2 of depth that isn't immediately apparent. Love it.

RATING: 8
The best dice game I own. Plenty of interesting decisions, lots of options on your turn, multiple routes to victory. 

Although many fields on the scoring sheet are fixed, I love that the tech tree is randomized, which makes for some very different experiences each time you play. I also really like that you can use an opponent's dice on your turn, which keeps all players engaged, even when it's not their turn. 

This feels like a big Feldian point-salad but it plays in about 30 minutes and fits into a tiny box. Even more amazing is that it wasn't actually designed by Stefan Feld!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Another in the line of very simple, but somewhat uninteresting, dice games based on a somewhat popular base game. As with most of these, I could take it or leave it, as there's nothing really here to set it apart from any of the others.

Still, it's a decent game; the main thing marring it is all the vagarities in the rule book. I can't really think of any other game where we've had so many rules questions for such a simple game, and I've played thousands of games.

Overall, it's fine if you're looking for a dice roller.

RATING: 7
The dice are not up go standard, one die had a wood chip missing from a face, others the octopod side had issues, that and the octopod color is awful against a black die face.

I got a die replacement for the chipped die, using the others as is.

Scoring pad? Trying to figure out how to make my own wood score pad using cribbage pegs. I dislike laminating pads and using erasable pens. 

As quick as this game plays you can run through a lot score pads even if double sided and the game is useless without them. Why don't they put up a PDF file on their web side so you could print your own?

RATING: 3
It's kinda neat that he could capture some of the flavour of Aquasphere, I guess.  Just, none of the interesting decisions that made Aquasphere so good.

There isn't nearly enough dice mitigation in here (is there any?)  I guess some of the lab techs can turn one face into another, but that's sooooo limited in scope.  You end up far too beholden to the roll of the dice.  Look at VivaJava Dice for a great tech tree.

Progression up the lab tech tree is slow, and doesn't give you much in the way of benefits.  Scoring 0 points for a turn is just lame, and you end up getting stuck with nothing to do far too often.

Plus, it's not really interactive - look at La Granja No Siesta for that.

Reminds me off dry-erase games I vaguely remember playing in the backseat as a kid. Really fun!

Edit: Bumping to a 9 after several more plays. Quick, fun and very satisfying to fill out your sheet. I wish larger games incorporated this simple, clear progressive scoring system. It really could help give a sense of what you have achieved in the game and where your points are coming from.

OctoDice is 30 minutes of entertaining dice rolling. There are a lot of these games around so does OctoDice cut above the rest? I would say it is one of the best. Firstly there is little downtime with three. Yes you have to wait whilst each opponent rolls the dice three times but once they have finished rolling you have the option of using some of their dice, so you are involved. Nevertheless I would still keep the player numbers to three. Four may be a little too long await for your turn.

The dice you keep score in different ways, all very Euro-ish, with tech trees, areas for majority scoring, others for incremental scoring and some penalties for not achieving certain Octopod targets. 

It all works really well with different paths to victory, and it could be my new favourite dice game (excluding the classic Can’t Stop).

Aquasphere-themed Qwixx-like dice game
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
OctoDice is a reasonably interesting Yahtzee clone that I liked much more than I expected. The unique hook here is that you can roll your dice up to 3 times (per standard Yahtzee) but you must keep 2 -- and no more than 2 -- dice each turn. Keeping only 2 dice leads to some tough decisions when you've got several that you really need. What to do?! The dice are a mix of actions and numbers that you pair up to achieve goals on your scoresheet.

This one reminds me of Qwixx in that it's a dice game where you scratch off goals on a scoresheet. Like Qwixx, other players can use some of your dice on your turn such that everyone stays engaged. There are different ways to go about getting points as well as a tech tree to pursue for bonus powers and endgame scoring. As far as Yahtzee variations go, I like this better than most.

Jueguito de dados entretenido y divertido que da muchas opciones y caminos para ganar puntos, muy al estilo ensalada de Feld.

Another Yahtzee-style variation on a big game, with both light and shadow. The requirement to pick exactly two dice each roll sometimes forces hard decisions but also considerably increases the importance of lucky final rolls. Overall, the game is probably a little overwrought for such a small dice chucker and I'm tempted to call it "Point Salad, the Dice Game". It does stay true to its source material in that respect.

Aqua sphere the dice game. A point salad dice game, there were interesting decisions to be made about what to go for and what dice to use from other players for your 2 freebies.

I enjoyed this dice game, there is more meat here than other light dice games. If you play it a lot, it would probably get repetitive but otherwise, a good game to pullout every once and awhile

It turns out you can boil "there's never enough actions to do what you want!" down too far for me. Much too far.

Two neat (new to me) mechanics-- the die pairing, and the implicit push-your-luck of "copy an opponent's dice twice every two rounds". They're not wasted here, just also not enough to recommend the game.

I have only played this game solo but very much enjoy it.  It took about three plays before I really understood the scoring but as each play only took about 15 minutes, it didn't take a large investment.

This is not a good game, but it does have dice and octopods. And dice with octopods.

The scoring is a little floopy, which is a fake word, the very best fake word, which you'll have to discern the meaning of through context. Which I am too bored to provide.

The thing about a game like this is that you really need to play it through one time to get a feel for what tactics are going to pay off in the latter-turn and end-game scoring. But I am not about to play this a second time. So I guess that's a half hour of my life I'll never get back, and even if I got it back I'd probably waste it thinking about butter or monkeys or something.

[microbadge=1714]

[u]29-Oct-2017[/u]:   This is a light, roll & write game, but I really enjoy it. Each turn, you begin by rolling six dice.  You keep two, roll the rest.  Keep two again, and roll once more.  Three of the dice determine which actions you an take.  The other three dice will tell you how you can resolve those actions (how strong or where based on the color).  So you will pair up the dice and choose two of those pairs to resolve as you attempt to score as many points as you can over the course of the game.

The part of OctoDice that makes it stand out a little from other R&W games I've played is the variable Lab setup. There is a 3x3 grid of tiles with special actions or additional scoring. You can "build" your lab throughout the course of the game, but you must go in order from top to bottom in each column, sort of tech tree style. So as the game progresses and you build more of your lab, there are more ways to manipulate the dice and score bonus points. Each tile is double sided so you can just shuffle them up at the start of each play and have a slightly different way to play each game. Pretty cool stuff.

RATING: 7
Yet another in a long line of dice games that feel like Yahtzee at core. This iteration divides dice into action dice and colour/number dice which you pair up with actions to determine the value or strength of that action, which is nice. It's more limiting than traditional though in that you must roll 3 times and lock in 2 dice after each roll - which is neither here nor there in the big scheme of enjoyment. The game also allows you to borrow 2 dice results from another player twice each round to boost yourself in an area which you couldn't roll yourself to give you something to do in other players' turns. Like all these types of games, it's easy to pick up and play, and basically harmlessly enjoyable, but it's not going to set the world on fire either.

That score sheet is a mess, and I feel it adtually makes the game harder to learn. Once you've ironed out the kinks, this is a surprisingly solid game. Tight, with some interesting ways to play off of other players rolls. I was pleasantly surprised with this game.

Yahtzee style dice game that's easy to play once you understand the rules.  Nothing new here but still a fun beer and pretzel game.  The dark purple octopods on the black dice was a bad production decision.

Quick to setup and play.  I like the dice locking mechanism and tech tree that helps to counteract the inherent randomness that comes with a dice game.
I had fun with a couple of solo plays.

I was pleasantly surprised.  There is surely luck, especially in getting techs early and finishing sets late.  But it averages out quite a bit even in solo, and the 'borrowed actions' smooth out luck even more in multi-player.

So, while there is luck, there are also always choices and tension about what choices to make.  The whole game is quite fast, especially solo.

Solo playable, dice game with pen and paper score sheets.  Have laminated some sheets and bought a whiteboard pen- this works well.
A lovely light quick little game.

From Spirit Games

Themed Yahtzee clone with added tech routes.

Like the way when on another players turn the gameplay allows you to use 2 dice from their roll to score for yourself.

Not bad, and after a few games, scores seem to be fairy tight varying from 25 to 35 depending mainly on the dice rolls. Not sure if this is a good thing or not... we'll see after a few more games.

I really enjoy this game solo mode. Gets a lot of play on my lunch hour.  Lot’s of choices and no two games are alike. I think the theme works really well too. Artwork is top notch. I recommend it.

Aquasphere the dice game!

RATING: 8
In an Aquasphere Theme you are trying to use your dice to collect points. Mechanism totally! different from Yatzee. Also, in every turn you can use one dice combination of your opponent for scoring. 
Point collecting is possible in many different ways so you will have to decide each roll which dice combination to take. Despite the first look it is not too simple, might add some downtime if you are playing with "longthinkers".

Solid roller with some depth. The spy mechanic, which allows you to "steal" other player's dice, is clever and keeps everyone engaged even when it's not their turn. The dice-pairing mechanic is cool, too.

One of the better Yahtzee variant dice-chuckers out there - I liked it.

tl;dr: nice dice game

This is one of those dice games where you get some dice which you get to re-roll and then you cross off some things on your personal score sheet. This game uses the theme elements from [thing=159508][/thing], and I think that while the game isn't very thematic, the theme works fine.
While this game doesn't do anything new, it works fine, and I enjoyed it.

Initial rating: 6.8/10

Essen 2015. Signed by designer.

Played a lot solo and only once with 4 players. It's actually a really fun and quick solo game. It would probably work pretty well for 2 and perhaps 3 players too, but it got a bit slow with 4.

About [thing=180231][/thing]:

[b]1) What is it?[/b]
[thing=180231][/thing] is a dice game about choices and set collection. Weirdly enough, it doesn't have eight dice - it has six. It was made to resemble [thing=159508][/thing], so the theme is basically the same: non-existent. In a more serious note, players are doing underwater research, and can use divers, submarines, crystals, octopodes, etc to gain points, as well as expand the lab in order to, eventually, also gain points and have bonus actions.

[thing=180231][/thing] is a smart game: it offers plenty of options and, while players are, indeed, a little cornered by what the dice offer, most of the time is down to choices made by the players that spur the game forward. But, yes, rolling some particular combination (and, therefore, luck) can have influence in the results.

Due to the random nature of the dice rolls, coupled with the duo-sided tiles for the lab expansions combinations, the replay value is high - but the overall feel doesn't change all that much, meaning that [thing=180231][/thing] is probably a game not to be played too many times in a short period, or it will appear same-y and one might considered it to be "spent".

The production value for [thing=180231][/thing] is good: the dice are fine (not engraved, still it seems it can take a lot of plays before showing any sign of use), the tiles are serviciable and the scoring pad is colorful and does the job well, however is the only reason why the box is as big as it is, as the whole game without it could fit in a [thing=129622][/thing] bag.

[b]2) How do you play?[/b]
As per the description: on your turn, you roll six dice (three white and three black); two dice (one white and one black) form an action. Every roll you must pick exactly two dice to take out (any colour). In the end you combine the six dice any way you want, no matter in which order you chose to take them out of your rolls beforehand. You can use only two actions on your turn.

On your development sheet you enter the actions chosen for this turn and note your points. You can also decide to "expand your lab" which will give you bonus actions or points. Other players may pick any action combination from your dice roll to add to their sheet.

Most of the things score immediately, except some that happen at the end of each round: submarines and the negative points for those that didn't fight enough Octopodes (at least two); and some happen at the end of the game: from developments of the lab and majority of crystals.

The game ends when each player had 6 turns. Whoever has the most points in the end wins.

[b]3) Which are the decisions made during play?[/b]
- Which two dice to keep after each roll. This is key to broad the amount of options you will have later, as some icons/colors/numbers can allow for more than one action to be done. This can also be used when trying to prevent someone else from doing something, since the other players will be able to use your dice to do one action;
- What dice to use to make the actions at the end of the three rolls - one white and one black must be used. This decision can also happens in the other players turn, as the others might pick two of the dice you rolled in order to make one action. This is the main decision, as it is the one that carries the whole game. Many times the choice will be clear and easy to be done, while in others, not so much: usually will fall in the "points now" or "take a risk to get more points later" territory;
- What developments to make in the lab. The developments have three columns of three developments, therefore is possible to follow multiple paths, in order to have more options, with special actions, or gain extra points; or especialize in one, trying to reach the third level (the ones that give end game points).

These are the decisions. None truly hard, but they are constant and matter, which is more than one can say about many dice games.

[b]4) What are the good things in the game?[/b]
- Production value is fine;
- Language independent;
- Offers a good amount of choices while also keeping itself light enough for casual play;
- Has interaction (with the use of the dice the others rolled and in the majority of crystals), but not harmful;
- Plays rather fast (around 20-25 minutes);
- Works well for 2 players.

[b]5) Which are the bad news?[/b]
- Luck of the roll can decide games;
- While the box isn't truly huge, it is for the amount of the components the game has, when taken out the scoring pad.

[b]6) How do you feel while playing?[/b]
Definitely not like in the film [i]Abyss[/i], for lack of weird under the sea adventure and mistery, nor [i]The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou[/i], mostly due to the lack of Bill Murray. [thing=180231][/thing] could be a lot of other things, as the theme is thin and has little to no relevance. Yet, the actual gameplay is engaging and relaxed. I had a good time playing it, and was surprise by the amount of (light) decisions the game allows, specially due to the openess of the use of dice once the three rolls are done, with the mix and match.

In the end, [thing=180231][/thing] was a pleasant experience, one I will seek more times, as it offers choices, a tad of interaction, a fine amount of replay value, has almost no time of set up and tear down, and a whole play is finished in under 30 minutes. Can't ask much more from a light dice game. Approved.

An addictive Yahtzee variant with point salad scoring.  The scoring choices are fun.  I love the community selection to use (and decide when to use) dice from other player rolls that keeps players engaged when it isn't their turn.  This is one of our favorite camping and traveling games with 5-6 players using laminated score sheets and dry erase markers.

RATING: 7.5
Great little roll-and-write with a variable tech tree that works pretty well to help keep things fresh through multiple plays. The AquaSphere theme doesn't hurt either since that's one of my favorite Euros. I've played 4x solo and 1x 2p and both work well. Solo is very fast and fun. Multiplayer adds a dice-copying twist to inject some interaction and keep it from being completely multiplayer solitaire. The dice are kind of crappy quality (wooden with shoddy printing) which is a bit of a bummer, but I also got the game for $10 on Amazon so I'm not going to be too picky about components. Highly recommended!

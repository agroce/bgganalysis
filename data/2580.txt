RATING: 9
Great add-on for this serie with a pre-war element, the diplomatic game, which is a little gem
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The final game (Game 4) in the Third World War series. Introduces the US RDF (Rapid Deployment Force, not Radical Dance Faction!) and the B52 'stack killer' counter. As part of the series, it provides a backdrop, a political sub-game and a set of rules to mobilise NATO and the Warsaw Pact and start the war. 
As a stand-alone, it isn't the best game of the series, nor is it a good introduction to the other games. However, if you have the other three, you need this one!

adds little to main game but interesting situation in it's own right

RATING: 6
Perhaps the weakest of the series if considered individually.  I do however, love the diplomacy at the start.  The PACT aren't strong enough to take on the Americans who spend most of the game chasing shadows in the wilderness.

My second favourite of the third world war series. Excellent stand alone game and comes with a nice political pre-game. Not sure how well it simulates actual events as they have unfolded, but still good.

Viewed as part of the Third World War series I would rate this higher.  I enjoy playing the other games in this series but this one for me does not play well on its own.

NB
My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

August 2013: Just picked up a beautiful copy from eBay. This looks like it might be the best of the four "Third World War" series games. Can't wait to play all four linked together in a massive World War Three campaign!

RATING: 6
This is the most flawed of the Third World War series, but is still playable, although NATO have a serious disadvantage here, namely not enough units to counter the Soviets in all areas of the map. For this reason, this game is not at its best when played on its own. It should be combined with the other games in the series, whereby units can be moved around from theatre to theatre. However the initial diplomacy card game is fun and ensures no two games start the same way.

This is an awesome scenario, the big event only second to the Battle for Germany in terms of importance and scope.  The diplomacy mini game that starts the Third World War adds more narrative to an already great game and the "on-the-fence" nature of all the Iranian factions as you vie for their supports adds a little spice to the scenario.  The system manages to handle the complicated situation in the Middle East with minimal fuss.  Must have game and one of my all time favorites.

Homemade version using color copies made from the game when I owned it with Map mounted on Foamboard. Very High Quality.

RATING: 9
Although having a VERY large map, this is one of my all time favorites.
The situation is far more fluid than any of the "european" games of this series, and the game itself allows for playing a variety of "what if" scenarios as well as a couple of regional war possibilities...
(second Iran-Iraq war, Desert Storm-with modification)

I love the political aspect of this game

RATING: 7.2
This is a cool game. The diplomacy cards are not very refined. I played with a pre-set definition of which alliances would form, it plays great given that.

RATING: 10
Outstanding wargame and part of the great Third World War Series by GDW. Plays very well as a stand alone game. Great air rules (which are always a difficult challenge) and ground combat system.

Innovative and fun "pregame" where each side plays cards (think of a simple Days of Decision, in fact Harry Rowland, says it was the mechanic he utilized to do Days of Decision) and trys to pull various factions into their camp before the real game begins. Nice to see the initial political dimension of the a potential gulf war (between NATO and the Pack) so elegantly simulated. Countries are also rated for becoming shaken and demoralized.

Had a chance to play again recently for the first time in 2+ decades (see my session report, which also discusses why I think the design is brilliant). Although the I-go-you-go mechanic is dated, the game is still a gem.

GDW's "Third World War" series on the Persian Gulf.  What it can anticipate is correct there is 2 Gulf Wars following the game publication under 2 Bush administration.  What it cannot anticipate, however, is the fall of Saddam Hussain following the fall of the Soviet Union.....

A bit of a disappointment, mostly of interest as an exploration of the terrain. The setting is good, the diplomatic game is inspired, but the fixed multi-echelon sequence designed for the Central Front seems to make little sense with the wide expanses and thinly spread forces of this theatre.  Ironically this is particularly obvious if the Soviets win the diplomatic game. Also the victory conditions are rather myopic. Basically the oilfields in the Euphrat/Tigris coastal plain are what matters, even though there would be no way to get the oil out if the Soviets control the Iranian coastline.   The West needed the oil, not the Soviets - having that area as a war zone would have been just as bad.

RATING: 10
One of my favorite games. The basic GDW TWW system is great (and it's still one of the best operational system in the wargame world IMHO) and the addition of the diplomatic phase is great. You feel the tension rise  while you are trying to maneuver your forces in position hoping to gain the advantage over the enemy before tghe first shot is fired. I agree that the first wave of soviet forces is underpowered compared to the RDF (or Centcom), but they can literally swarm over the iranian army. This is the basic reason to reach hormuz first...

RATING: 7.5
While the geo-political situation has changed, still a fun game. Especially the diplomatic "pre-game". However, GDW should have provided breakdown counters for the US 24th Mech Div. It's a 900lb gorilla but the US really needs more, smaller units to thwart the Soviet advance.

Lots of space not many counters - maybe a good thing, although the US can cover only a small area with its mighty but non-breakdownable divisions. Once the B52s arrive the Pact would be unwise to stack anything. Getting Iraq on your side delivers a massive advantage both with the units and not having to fight around the edges. With lots of mini-wars going on in different places (USSR/Turkey - Turkey/Syria - Jordan/Syria - top of the Gulf) it makes a strange game, but still fun.

I really like this series, like most people I guess...but this one game had a problem in the card play, and as a stand alone game it didn't hold much interest.  As a sideshow to WWWIII the middle east actually isn't all that interesting.

I rated this game as I did because the diplomatic pre-war turns don't appeal as much as the slug-fest once the armed forces are unleashed.  This is an interesting theater with too much territory and too few forces.

RATING: 6
I like the TWW system but I have reduced my rating of this game as a result of several recent plays. As Iraq seems always destined to be neutral - assuming both sides play their cards even semi competently - whole areas of the map remain entirely unused. The US RDF is far too small to stop the Soviet hordes on their own or even with parts of thye useless Iranian Army but anyway it usually ends up bottled up in the Bandar Khomeini very quickly.The Soviets should be mandated to invade Turkey just to make the game a bit more interesting. Yes the US airpower is overwhelming but the US get stuffed on any turn where then they are not flying for some reason.

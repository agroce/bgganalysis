GAME: Viva Pamplona!
RANK: 3704

RATING: 6.5
Very thematic and hilarious game with a roll-and-move/push your luck mechanic about bull running.

The goal of the game is to score the most courage points.  Each player has 3 runners, and there is one bull-meeple (El Toro) and a bull deck of cards.  Each turn, a player rolls two dice (each die has arrow results which are essentially wild cards) and has to move two of his three runners (allowing for some choice/decisions).  Then after each player has moved their runners, the last player flips a bull card, which either results in a movement of the bull or a bull attack, each result with very different consequences.

Points are scored by demonstrating courage: you want to be a close to the bull (ideally on the same space or just in front) as possible; too far ahead and you won't score points, if you're behind him, you'll lose points.  There are tactical scoring opportunities from running as well- if you can establish a majority of your runners on your turn on a space, you can bully/push other runners and get courage points from them, and push them frontwards or backwards potentially costing them even more points.  Finally there is the push your lack element at the end of the game.  The game ends when El Toro reaches the arena.  You score points by getting your runners into the arena ahead of him- of course the earlier you arrive, the less points you score, so you want to get into the arena late, but before El Toro (if he gets in before you, you lose points, and they can be substantial).

The game plays 2-6 players, is very light, but also very fun and thematic.  It's language independent, but hard to find- this should definitely be reprinted.  I think this will become my favourite roll and move game (possibly beating out another Kramer great, That's Life!).

Recommended changes -

We pass the first player marker around during the game.  If you went first on a turn, the next turn you will go last, just before the bull moves/rampages.  We make you pay 1 machismo point for each pawn of yours that moves/get pushed into a Safety square.  If a Safety square would otherwise qualify for the 1/2/3 points of rampage from the bull, you don't get paid.
----------------
We also pass the first player marker around. Safety spots cost 1 pt of"honor" but otherwise don't effect scoring.

Very light, fun, filler game.  I enjoy how it plays up to six and how mean it can be.

This was a minor grail for me because of the theme.  I have it and it has met my expectations (and more as it is faster than I expected).

Nada más ver el tablero, cualquiera puede pensar que se trata de una oca, y algo de eso hay. Es un juego de hasta seis jugadores. Cada jugador controla tres corredores... y el objetivo consiste en hacer un encierro sumando la mayor cantidad de puntos posible. Todos empiezan con 30 puntos.
En su turno el jugador tira dos dados y con ellos ha de mover dos de los tres corredores que tiene bajo su mando. Si al mover, un jugador tiene mas  corredores en una casilla que algún adversario, le puede empujar tantas casillas como la diferencia de coredores y le roba un punto. 
Después de que han movido todos los jugadores, mueve el toro. Su movimiento está controlado por cartas, que indican cuánto avanzará el toro. De vez en cuando se produce un embestimiento, y entonces hay que hacer recuento de puntos. Aquellos que estén por detras del toro pagan tantos puntos como la distancia que los separan de él. Los que están con el toro, suman 3, los de la casilla siguietne 2 y el siguiente 1. 

Al final del trayecto hay que entrar en la plaza y ocupar las gradas. El primero que ocupa es el que menos puntos recibe.  La partida acaba cuando el toro entra en la plaza.

Es un juego muy, muy sencillo, pero entretenido y con un puntito de estrategia. Accesible para toda la familia y con una temática muy nuestra. Las partidas son cortas, las decisiones que tomar pocas y en general fáciles y tiene importante componente de suerte...  A mí me ha soprendido gratamente.

The game is a hoot and a lot of fun.  However the first player to get all three pawns into the tomato obstacle can rack up an awful lot of points in a very short time by bopping the other players.  May need a house rule there.  A great, light six player game along the lines of TransAmerica, Rette Sich Wer Kann, or Schrille Stille.

Really neat filler type game!  While not many difficult decisions to make, the unpredictability of the bull made for a lot of fun.  In my first game, the bull moved 5 spaces two turns in a row right at the end, and only 4 people were able to finish the race before the bull crossed.  In another game, the bull kept moving low numbers and attacking, while everyone ran out ahead trying desperately to slow down and allow the bull to catch up!  Looking forward to more of this one!

This is a cute family-friendly game.  The bull's moves are quite unpredictable, which keeps the game light-hearted.  This is more fun with more players, which allows a lot of pushing of each other's pawns.  We use the unofficial rules that players take turns going first each round and that no points (good or bad) are awarded to players on orange spaces (except at the very end of the game).

This is a great theme, well-implemented in a luck-filled little race game. Its humorous to play, although there is an edge of nastiness.  At our local group, its used as a closer occasionally because of the short play time, simple rules and fun-factor.

RATING: 6
Cute, fluffy, but well-themed dice fest with significant tactical choices by Herr Kramer. Each player controls a team of 3 runners and the object is to stay as close to the bull as possible without falling behind. The game gains entertainment because of the pushing rules which allow groups of 2 or 3 to maul opposing player's pawns who are of a smaller group size. 

I also got an incredible amount of enjoyment out of Dave Vander Arks's "OLE!" variant where players have to all yell said word at the top of their lungs at the end of each round before the toro card is shown. I recommend this to anyone who plays this game in a gathering / con environment as it attracted plenty of interested people and made the game much more raucous and fun.

 Players allocate random dice to run their pawns in Spain's famous bullish event, receiving Courage Points for demonstrating the most bravery (lunacy?) before the crowd. Rules for pushing and "embarrassing" others' pawns as well as slippery tomato fields provide interesting tactical options. A rather large (not to mention unpredictable) bull figure adds a lot of fun, as does a nicely-illustrated board. Light fun for six or even more.

The "fluffy, dice-intensive" part of the description is correct.  Roll 'em and try to land two of your guys on one of somebody else's to steal a point.  The bull doesn't have much effect on scoring until the very end (and then only if he happens to jump ahead of a lot of players).  The tactics are very simple and the control is minimal.  At least it moves along fairly quickly.  Probably would be much better as a drinking game though.

RATING: 7
Great die rolling game where players run with the bulls at Pamplona.  Players have three runners, but can only move two per turn, and they are trying to hold and gain "machismo" points by being with or just ahead of the bull when it charges.  If you are behind the bull, you lose points.  Fun rules for bumping other pawns also.  A great example of a light German game that involves lots of laughs.

[1 play] Running with the bulls; surprisingly, this game involves no risk of being trampled to death.  It took all of us pretty much the first game to catch on to what we ought to be trying to do (staying close to the bull is important, but not as important as staying in front of the bull, especially at the end).  Modestly fun, and I would play again.

Played 1 time with 4 players. Ultra simple and very little tactics - simply keep your guys from falling too far behind so as not to incur penalty points. Also, in our game the bull did not attack ONE time...so he outran us and the game ended with the courage chips only increasing by taking them from others or going into safety spots. And the worst part is that there is no reason that couldn't happen in several playings if the big move cards come early for the bull, and the attack cards are near the end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun little racing & risk taking game in which you try to stay close to the bull or at least in front (the moment it gripes), and not behind or hidden as a coward. Enjoyed it with 2 as well as with 4 players. Though stealing courage chips when outnumbering other teams might be a bit far-fetched. And in some plays, one player was quite unlucky early in the game and never had a chance to strike back. Not throwing a single arrow is quite costly.

Nevertheless : Toréador, en garde !

RATING: 7
Another Kramer rich in theme.  This game is by no means a brain burner, it's a race game of sorts yet one doesn't want to be first to reach the arena.  Pamplona offers a few decisions per turn based upon the projected idea of how the bull will react.  Do I hold my runners back with the bull, or do I move forward.  Lots of possible screwage, and chaos when playing with the full compliment of six.  A wonderfully themed light filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
Rating based on one 6-player game in which I finished dead last.  It's hard to love a game whose primary mechanism is roll and move and a card drawing element that will determine what the "bull" does.  Too random, and the bull running through the streets on its way to the arena theme doesn't do a lot for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fun Fun Fun. This is a clever yet light game with some light decisions to be made. Best played with alot of people so that there is alot of pushing and shoving going on down the street. The wanting to get to the stands last, but before the bull is not only unique but clever. You never know if the bull is gonna take off and run like crazy or just take his time and attack as many people as possible. Plays quick and is just sooo much fun. I wish this game would be re-printed.

Variants we use:
Rotate the start player counter-clockwise after each round (so the last player plays first), if not the turn order will leave some people permanently screwed.

No points (good or bad) are awarded(paid) to players on orange spaces when the bull charges or when the bull enters the arena

Seed the bull cards somewhat evenly into the deck, otherwise it can suffer from a clunky misbalanced game with few scoring rounds
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
If you have a soft spot for fluffy, random kiddie games like Ghost Party, you'll love this.  Once the dice fall, the moves seem to play out on their own.  Rarely is there much doubt as to what the best move would be, and there's never any opportunity to make a clever move.  **Update** Raised my rating a point.  The game can be fun for adults, but probably needs alcohol.  Viva Pamplona could rate a point higher if my group didn't overthink the game.

I wanted to like the game, listening to the rules I was really thinking it was a good idea and great implementation.  However, the two games I played were basically all about beating the other players for their chips and not really about being near the bull.  I think I played with the game showcased at it's worst possible bit (6 players, built for beating up others).  Sucky, sucky time.

A silly but enjoyable roll and move game. The key is to run with or just in front of the bull. The only thing is you don't know how fast the bull will move.

seemed ok.  All the bull scoring cards didn't shuffle in well in our game, and nobody made it to the arena before the bull stormed in there.  seems like you have to stack the deck.  Average.  Probably a decent kids game

RATING: 7.2
Running of the Bulls game where 5-6 other players each race their 3 players to the stadium before the Bull gets there first. The game incentivizes you to stay close to the Bull to score bravery points, but you run the risk of being outrull by the bull and not making it to the stadium. Light, fun and just long enough. Worth having.

RATING: 6
This would make a great family game to play with your kids, where Midnight Party (also Kramer) is more just for kids or adults wanting to have a [i]really[/i] goofy game, you could play this game with your kids and still be [i]just[/i] interested enough. You could play it as an alright filler game with just adults too, should only be about 30 minutes or a touch over just be aware there is a BIG luck element.  

Very strong theme actually here and as you would expect in a vintage Kramer (or any Kramer) there is some light-hearted screwage to spread around, everyone should be able to get in on the 'action' here and its fairly minor in the game and all in good fun.   

Potentially a HUGE push your luck element at the end where you WANT to wait to get into the arena as the further along you get in, the more points you score BUT if the Bull catapults in at the last minute you are potentially stuck with a bunch of negative points instead. Good light-hearted fun. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.9
This is a rather light game of risk and probability management.

Sure, there's lots of luck as to when the bull "charges", but quite a lot of opportunity for "screwage" of your opponents. Definately a game for 4 - 6 players rather than 2 or 3.

And as others have atested, it is a fun game. Great as a filler or between heavier/meatier games or end of session. I always take my copy with me to conventions although it gets played rarely.

Fun little randomish game about running with the bulls in Pamplona.  You want to be as close to the bulls as possible, but not behind them, when the scoring cards come out.

A very random bull-racing game. For the most part, there is very little decision making, and when you do, its pretty obvious what to do. The only tense decisions come at the end, where players need to decide whether to risk staying out longer or rushing in and getting the points.

RATING: 7
A theme rich game where you do feel like you are running with the bulls.  A nice relaxing game to play when you don't want something too heavy.

I was taught the "safety" variant (orange spaces are "safe").  But I think the game works better without the variant (also becomes a lot easier to teach).

Fun game that works well for six.  Far lighter fare than the typical Kramer game.  I expect to continue to enjoy this game for many years.

Do you feel lucky?!  How close do you want to be to the Bull's horns?  The closer you are, the more courage points you're rewarded when the Charge (score) card turns up.  It's a racing game with an unusual theme with odd mechanisms.  To me, it also seems more like you are following in two racing games, one of the bulls and one of the runners.  We play with the variant where the Bull marker, or start player marker (of each round), passes counter clockwise.  It's largely a filler timing game on when you think the scoring cards arise, sort of the way you time to get out of a charging bull's way... ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Enjoyable if played with energy and everyone gets into the game.  Otherwise, it is pretty much roll two dice, move two guys, and perhaps shove an opponent to gain points "courage" or force them lose courage.  This is basically a race game in which you want to move just slightly faster than the pace of the bull.  Not too fast, not too slow or you end up paying courage points and losing.  Too fast at the end, you will end up gaining just a couple points when others may get a huge payday for staying with the bull.  Timing is everything, but everything is dependent on the roll of the dice!  Seems like this game plays seven without too many issues.  We used coins to represent the seventh player.

A pretty fun early Kramer game that would be great for a casual crowd of friends in a bar, or for those just getting into hobby gaming. There is really all that much to this game, and it would be a really great game to play with kids (I would imagine even kids as young as 5 would be able to play this competitively). You roll two dice and move one of your pawns (out of 3 on the board) one of the die values and move a second pawn the other value. Once everyone has moved this way flip the top card of the Toro deck and see if the bull attacks or moves. If he attacks players who are in front of, or on the same space as the bull will score courage points. Courage points can also be gained by setting up "pushes" when your pawns outnumber other player's pawns on a score at the end of your turn. A few special spaces on the board add a few interesting decision points during the game. You can also score points by making it to the arena before Toro the bull. At the end of the game the player with the most courage points wins the game.

Overall though, not a terribly taxing game, I definitely wish there was at least one more layer of decision making in the game. Not sure if I will keep it, but definitely glad I got a chance to play it.

10/10/06 Played a six player game, once. That's 53 minutes of my life I'll never get back. This was the sixth race type game I've played and I've strongly disliked them all. This "roll the dice and move" game should be reserved for those under the age of 10. When we got to the tomato patch on the board and we all began sliding backwards for several turns (which just prolonged the agony) I thought I was playing Sorry.

I normally don't like these light and fluffy games that much but this one justs hits me the right way. I love the pushing rules and the constant struggle to balance that urge to beat up your opponents with being in the best position to score when the bull attacks. I need to suggest this more often when we have 6 players and want to play a fun, quick and light game.

Now here's a game that I haven't pulled off the shelf in about 9 years, but I'm glad that I did.
I had forgotten how much silly fun this game is, and how very short it runs. It is very easy to teach (only takes about 3-4 minutes), fast-moving and doesn't take much time at all to play. Great for kids, but good to pull out with the adults too (if you aren't in a very serious mood).
Basically a gambling game, in that you are always taking a chance on whether you should be near the randomly moving bull for points, or up ahead in case he gets away from you.

A good game for 4am. Luck, shoving, barging, theme, theme, theme as you try and stay even or just ahead of the bull as he surges and slows and surges towards the arena (based on a card draw. so there's some odds management here). It gets another rating point for the pleasure of chanting PULL THE BULL each round. A good occasional closer with lots of players. The trick to doing well is to roll lots of wilds and keep your 3 guys together to steal points off the others (by outnumbering them and shoving them off a space), whilst of course keeping pace with the bull. As you may have gathered, there's a tremendous dependence on luck.

Speculating the speed of the bull and when the scoring cards come out is the only element I like, but is undermined by your die rolls. If you can't get courage points for being near the bull, you could take them off other players whilst pushing them away from the bull, so double "take that". This is an element I'm not keen on. When it's not your turn, there is nothing of gaming interest except the fun of pushing and the (mis)fortune of die rolls and being a referee. Quite thematic, in which I can't help feeling sorry for the bull.

Es un juego muy bueno para las fiestas.  Corre con los toros de Pamplona!  Light, for a euro game, and a bit long for a party game, but a whole lot of fun dripping with a solid theme.

Fun press your luck game - if you have Midnight Party you don't need this, and vice versa.

RATING: 6
Neat game that plays quickly.  Want to race, but at a pace that matches the bull.  Twist is each turn, you can only move 2 of 3 pawns - so have to balance your moves overall.  Plus the opportunity to shove your opponents around.  Plays quickly, nice mix of luck (die rolls) and tactics (arrows on the die rolls give the player a choice of moves) to make the game a bit more than a roll and move game.

Two player isn't nearly as much fun as it is with more players. The more the merrier. The one time I get to shove people. ;-)

RATING: 5
A light risk-taking game that when played quickly, and in the right spirit, can bring in some laughs. It's a gamble running either with the bull, in front or behind. So it's thematic as you gain or lose prestige points based upon your bravery. The player interaction kicks in as you kick and others kick you around. Some silly card draws can result in crazy games, but usually a session is a fun affair with six players.

Very fun if you are in the correct frame of mind.  We played with such house rules as "when you force a player out of a space, you must show your machismo by forcefully taking the point from the other player!".

RATING: 7.5
What an absolute cracker of a dice game. Strategy purists that loathe dice will hate this game no matter what. Each turn, you roll two dice and move 2 of your 3 bull runners. After all players have moved, the bull is moved. The object of the game is to get into the end stadium as LATE as possible but BEFORE the bull.

Along the way, courage points are won and lost by position of runners to the bull when a bull scoring card is turned over. A player can also gang up his runners to push other players onto bad spots on the board and get courage points from them.

Nice chunky bits, whimsical art and all round good fun.

It's cool the way the game plays out, but there's very few interesting decisions to be made and it can get quite repetitive.

RATING: 5
Light, and random.  This should not be taken seriously in any way, 2/3rds of the game is blind luck.  You may make a significant decision by the first 1/2 of the game, but don't bet on it.  Nonetheless, you will make a couple of worthwhile choices.

You simply must pass the start player around (It works well if you pass it to the right, so the last player plays first), if not the turn order will leave some people permanently screwed.

I would recommend seeding the bull cards somewhat evenly into the deck, otherwise it can suffer from clunky misbalanced games with few scoring rounds.  

This is a fun enough game, with some good ideas, but it desperately needs something more to give players the illusion of control. The system, as is, makes the game unbearably lucky.

I tried for a long time to trade for this, finally got a copy, and now I find that I don't like it as much as Midnight Party, a similar game. Oh well, at least the theme is unusual and there's a bit of spite!

RATING: 7
There is an enjoyable time to be had here, so long as you don't take it too seriously.  It has a bit of multi-player backgammon feel (keep your pieces together, pounce on lone opposing pieces) that you don't see too often.

Decent race game, but there are better roll-and-move games out there. The randomness of the bull movement is thematic and cool, but also a little annoying. Play Magical Athlete instead!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
This is a race game with a twist: a bull advances in an irregular, random pace; you're trying to stay as close to the bull as possible, entering the arena just before it does. 

Players' 3 pawns all start in the starting space. Players each start with 30VP tokens. On your turn, roll 2d6 (1-5, and arrow) and move 2 pawns, 1/die (the arrow is wild). There are a couple of spaces where you slide back, but otherwise it's a one-way trip. If you end in a space and outnumber another player's token(s), may move them as far as how you outnumber them; they give you 1VP. If they end up in a hiding space, pay 1VP to bank. If you get into the arena, take the first, lowest numbered empty space (numbered, and worth, 1-12VP).

At the end of the round (all players take 1 turn), draw a card from the bull's deck and either, according to the card:
- advance the bull as many spaces as shown
- score tokens: 
... in the bull space: 3VP
... ahead of the bull: 2VP or 1VP if 1 or 2 spaces ahead
... behind bull: -1VP per space
... if in a space marked with hiding space: -1VP

The game ends when the bull reaches the arena. Players score VP according to their spot in the arena. Most VP wins!

Merely a hoot!  We rotate the start player after each round.  Also, if a pawn is in a "Safety Space," we play that it is immune from paying when the bull charges (and likewise cannot get paid) or when the bull enters the arena.  This adds an interesting tactic or two.

This is a surprisingly fun filler from Kramer.  The game just has a great look as the mob of runners shove each other around and try to stay a little ahead of the bull.  The dice tend to even out over the course of the game, and since there are so many wildcard rolls, there is some skill.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Luck of the die rolls play a huge part in this clever race-game-with-a-twist. But the theme is so strong and engaging that, in my experience, players are far more likely to be caught up in and swept away by the fun factor than fuming about the luck component. Torro, Torro, Torro!

Viva Pampolona is a real goofball of a dice game, one that is so primitive that I really felt like I was drinking red wine in Spain and playing in a pueblo bar because there wasn't anything else to do.  It's a luckfest that would have evaporated by now if it weren't for the the evocative theme and colorful art.  All of which make it perfect for late night gaming events where chance plays a large role and everybody gets to holler.

Totally thought-optional so far as I can tell, and horribly unbalanced - the earlier you go in the turn order, the worse you are likely to do.  This could be fixed by rotating the start player, but the rest of the game is so random I can&#039;t see it helping the overall experience much.

(after 1 6p game)  Kramer put a winner with this one.  A race game where you want to be "brave" and not be too far out in front, or too far behind the bull.  There is pushing among the runners and obstacles on the course.  A fun, light-hearted game.  OLE!!!!

A race game that is a roll and move but the theme, componets and some of the mechansims for movement elevate this from a boring race game like Aggrivation to a very enjoyable gaming experience.  Ole!

RATING: 7
Run, run from the bulls! No, wait too fast, now you look like a wuss -- arggh, Torro's now overtaking you. You can bully others, but that's hardly going to win you the game. Grab onto the side of the bull, and try to ease into the arena just ahead of it.

A fun game with 4-6 players and simple rules that take only a few minutes to explain. Sometimes, though, the bull barely runs or does nothing but run, which makes the game repsectively long and boring or short and boring. I hope you never encounter such a deck or else people will want to gore you for suggesting such a game.

RATING: 7.4
A fun Euro party style game where the more, the merrier.  There's luck of the dice and card draw for the bull but the decision making is in how to best manage your meeples to keep them near the bull as you can only move two of the three.  Fun but not totally mindless fun.  I consider this a hidden gem and best of all it plays from 2 to 6 players.

I like race games a lot and Viva Pamplona is a simple fast-paced game with nice components. The way the bull moves and the idea that the players try to finish before the bull, but as late in the race as possible is cool.

Played once (with 3 players). A light racing game with some decisions and quite a lot of randomness. Still my only playing has been enjoyable and I suppose that it is more fun (but probably less controllable) with 5 or 6 players. The fixed turn order can be a problem, though.

Neat racing and push-your-luck game that can be played by any age and group. Be aware, though, that the game has a little mean in it while players push each others' pawns around.

Very simple worker-placement type of game where you can have a bit of take that if you want. The theme wasn't as prominent as I would have liked, since all of the technologies are basically named and aren't different.

I enjoyed the two-player rules for the base PnP game. However, I'm especially interested in the Kickstarter edition now that Heiko and Tobias have finished polishing the game with Two Tomatoes.

Played a demo of this at Essen. The action selection (worker placement) part of the game seemed neat. I cannot judge the full game yet as we only played a shortened version of the game. It will not be a very deep euro though due to some amount of randomness in the cube draw.

I wish the rulebook was clearer on what the actual goal of the game is: gearing up to be the most influential player in the energy market after peak oil hits. The different technologies are a bit abstract, and I'm not sure whether the theme comes through, but the game works and is fun to play.

RATING: 5
Hoo, really really not sure on this one.  Definitely need to play again but this didn't feel right.  Despite the rule book telling me otherwise, it sure feels like there's a turn order problem.  Going late in the first round seems really bad.  It is short, which is nice, but not long enough to formulate or execute a plan.  Important (?) but arbitrary rules are in the clarifications, like you can see a new set of 3 oil/startup cards before you take the action.  Really really doesn't make much sense, why limit to 3 at all then, or were they just trying to inject luck?  As it doesn't appear anywhere in the main rules, it seems like a cludgy bolt on.  I could tell there was something potentially interesting going on, I liked the actions and I liked the oil shipping part but it just felt half baked.  The first play was pretty opaque, and I know I need to give this another chance with an idea of what is supposed to be going on, but this did not leave a good first impression.

RATING: 8
Rating base on one play so far- we misplayed some rules and would probably play with more barrels when we play again, but it's a good game. Lots of crunchy decisions and heavier than it's artwork and few components suggests. Very meaty for the footprint.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Played with 4.   Very nice worker-placement/area control/economic game.  The consistent theming and visual style pull it all together.

What I liked:
- theme, visual style
- blocking aspect of taking actions
- game length of about 90 minutes with 4 new people, would be shorter on subsequent plays
- the way the risky options work requiring bag pulls
- the black market and either moving those barrels to the oil fields, or to the technologies

What I didn't care for:
- Component quality is generally good with the barrels and the board, but the cards are flimsy and the box seems thin.
- Economy is very tight, for much of the game, most people had at most 2-3 barrels, if any.  With a limited amount of oil in the economy, there wasn't a lot that would be extracted and so I didn't have a lot of options for investing in start-ups

Variants:
- To boost the amount of oil in the game, using some of the extra barrels that came with it, in addition to the normal setup of drawing 1 card per player and adding 2 barrels to those fields, I would also add 1 barrel to all fields to make some of them more in play earlier.
- Peak Oil phase is a little wonky.  There is a definite disadvantage to being just to the right of the player that triggered Peak Oil.  You go last in any spots where you are tied.  One of the developers posted a comment that he originally had an idea where once Peak Oil was triggered, the game would play as normal, but when you took an action you removed your agents not to your HQ but to the box.  When you had no more agents you were skipped.  Once all the agents were in the box, move on to end game scoring.  While you could, in theory, get to a point where no one wants to take an action, this would allow more people to invest in technologies or start-ups.
- Stalemate variant (as suggested by a player aid): at the start of a turn you can take an action at an action spot that has 5 agents, you must take an action there (with or without risk).

UPDATE: with the just announced Spillover expansion, it looks like there are a few variants you can play with that change up different aspects of the game, one of which is the above mentioned Peak Oil variant where you keep playing as normal until everyone has no more workers around.  That is right up my alley.

This game is really about screwing over the other players' ability to make actions.  The mechanism of re-assignment is it's biggest design flaw.  It provides no way to overcome your opponent's dickery.  In fact, it forces you to take another action that hurts yourself and any strategic plans you may have had for your moves.  It got to the point where we coined the phrase "Fuck You!  You just got Peak Oiled"

Peak Oil is a game I have been desperately wanting to play but my first go left me a bit cold. I think I still want the game and, with the right crowd and experienced players, I think it would take on a whole new dimension of strategy. Initial rating is a 7 with a good chance that I will bump this up to an 8 after a few more plays and *gasp* possibly a house rule?

PROS
-The worker placement mechanic is easy to pick up but has the extra added wrinkle of needing to have majority or at least tie and take the risk of plunging into the bag. This adds to the depth of planning.
-The artwork and wry humor, while not everyone's ideal, hits just right for me.
-The end game scoring that has different start-ups be worth different amounts to players depending on their oil fields adds another twist to a typical stock mechanic.

CONS 
-#1 Issue: Some of the consultant cards seem fabulously overpowered. Add to that the fact that not every player is going to get a level 2 or level 3 card, it means that a player could not only scoop up the VP from the cards but that ability could allow a player to dominate. (Ex: One opponent got the level 1 consultant that meant he always had the majority when tied. I got the level 1 card that allowed me to recruit a single agent, which is what the recruit action allows you to do.) Potential house rule: A consultant's power can only be used once. (Not sure if this works in practice as I don't know what all the consultant powers are.)
-The components were a bit small, especially the barrels, which meant that they had a tendency to get knocked over and roll. The board was also on the small side but not a deal breaker. I assume that this helped with production costs and the sale point, which still make it a bit pricey for me as the game ships from Europe.

Essayé à Essen 2016
Peak Oil est conçu par deux gars. L'un est le graphiste/concepteur à l'origine de The Dice Must Flow. C'est beau, forcément. on joue une megacorp du pétrole. Le pétrole arrive à sa fin (on a passé le pic) et il faut préparer l'après mais en loucedé. Un sac contient des barils de pétrole noir, jaune ou rouge. On va faire souvent des tirages dans ce sac pour permettre des actions sur la carte. Les barils noir, c'est cool : c'est le pognon du jeu. Ils ne sont pas replacés dans le sac. Jaune, c'est un neutre. Ils ne valent rien mais tu peux retirer un baril au hasard, si tu veux. Rouge, c'est une crise de relations publiques. Ils sont remis dans le sac. Vous l'avez pigé, au fur et à mesure du temps, les crises de RP vont se multiplier.
Le pétrole, il faut le récolter sur le plateau, le transporter et payer les petits dictateurs, pirates, etc. qui se trouvent sur le trajet. Les routes sont plus ou moins dangereuses en fonction du temps. Le marché vous rapporte plus ou moins de pognon, en fonction du temps (la mécanique est très simple et maline).
Vous pouvez, évidemment, acheter des "consultants" pour vous aider à gérer les crises, les problèmes, etc.
Avec le pognon, vous investissez, via le marché noir ou publiquement, dans des nouvelles technologies. Vous avez acheté des startups et des champs pétrolifères. A la fin du jeu, les points de victoire sont (barils sur une technologie+champs pétrolifères de la même technologie)x (start-ups bossant sur cette techno que vous avez achetées).
Cynique et bien foutu, joli, j'suis fan.

No scaling on player count. Spots are constantly full at 4/5 players and you can never do what you want, especially terrible in the end game mechanism.
Poor component quality for price point. 
Artwork makes the game feel drab and empty.

very beautiful game. The design is very 70's.
The game mechanism is in equilibrium, and the different players can modify the feel of the game, just by focussing on different aspects of it.

adventurous players will reach peak oil earlier in the game, just by pulling more out of the basket. The more calculated players will try to have a majority and to minimize the pulling. This lengthens the game. But both kind of players can enjoy the game.

A decent worker placement with an interesting theme.  Played three times and all three times the win condition was the same.  Played with three players which seems to be optimal for gameplay.  This would really bog down with more than that.  The components, in particular the cards, are really cheap feeling and will definitely require sleeves in order to prevent easy damage.  The pawns for the workers are so dull and remind me of something out of a Sorry! game.  The barrels are nice wooden pieces, it's just a shame that the other pieces didn't share their quality.  There seems to be only one main strategy for winning, which is upsetting being there are a few ways to score VP.  I would play this game again, but for a worker placement, I would look elsewhere in my collection for real satisfaction.

OMG ... a lesson in boredom. The game is ugly, the mechanisms are tedious, the fun is at level minus one or even lower. I can see that people might be attracted to that kind of game, but it's definitely not for me. :gulp:

I'm pretty sure we debunked peak oil like 15 years ago.  I can't believe this company is releasing two peak oil games in the same year, and worker placement games to boot.  High likelihood that these are time traveling hobos from the 1990s looking to crack in on the board game renaissance.  Beware!

It is nice to see some mechanism that I have in one of my designs come to life and get published - running out of the oil barrels - mine was running out of lesser stuff at the top of the ocean and have to dive deeper. Either way, cool to see it working.
I have the files for PO, but the rules/board were in a flux for a bit so I did not get a chance to play it yet. Also, my gaming group of 3+ is into lighter affair. I look forward to the published version.

Played a few rounds, the rulebook is poorly organized but after playing once and then reading through again it mostly made sense.

tl;dr: not engaging

It's weird. Some games take a theme and a bunch of different, well known mechanisms and turn out great. Others take a theme and a bunch of different, well known mechanisms and turn out very meh. Unfortunately this game fell in that last category for me. There's a pretty cool WP mechanism where there can be quite a bit of competition do be able to do certain actions at certain times. There's also competition for the resources on the map, getting shares in the new startup companies... you know, stuff that is usually interesting. But for me (and Myriam, who turned out as the winner) this fell quite flat. You go through the motions and make some progress and that's all good and well, but it just didn't engage either of us. It was just a big meh-fest.

This game ends quicker than you think.  And understanding the end-game "peak oil" phase is crucial.  I give it credit for cramming in a lot of moving pieces (literally, oil barrels are being moved every which way for most actions) in a short playtime.  One non-trivial components complaint: the game will constantly ask you to evaluate the # of black barrel pieces...inside of a black bag.  Why not supply the game with a white bag to make this task easier?

I backed this game on KS. I was initially drawn to it because I was looking for an economic game and this had a very stylized art. I do like the worker placement aspect as well as the gradual increase in value of various technologies open for investment. The consultant power are fairly diverse and there are some very good synergies that you can create.

I will say that it takes 2 to 3 plays to really understand some of the nuances. I also wish they had referred to the two basic steps as "operations", because my fellow players kept getting confused about the sequence of a reassign a worker/take an action then reassign a worker- I think we've all played enough other games to generally refer to these as actions.

Very solid game with nice artwork, decent components and engaging play.

Played twice at 4p. A nice blend of WP and economic investment. Peak oil has a nice flow with quick turns + I find the graphic design extremely striking. Currently rating a 7 and may adjust up or down as I play more.

I wish the rules were slightly better edited, and the action spaces has some symbols on them to remind you of what they do.

The game has a few odd design choices, notably that before selecting a card from drilling or investing, you can flush the market for a random three cards. This is pretty much total luck of the draw, and feels really out of place with the rest of the game. Feel like there should be a more elegant solution to this.

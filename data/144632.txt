RATING: 4
*Rating based on a partial play.

The game seems like a promising idea, but the execution seems flawed.  The rulebook is very lacking and makes the game difficult to figure out.  We felt like we must have been playing something wrong, but couldn't figure out what it was from the rulebook.  We got so frustrated that we gave up part way through.  The one positive the game has going for it is that the component quality is great.  The game also feels like it should involve a lot of negotiation, but there doesn't seem like there's much you can use to negotiate with.  The building tiles are all thick cardboard, the artwork is high quality (though we did have a shortage of cubes at one point).

Sim City 2013. Nice semi-coop aspect to the game and nostalgic graphics. Beautiful thought out game but in the end it suffers from a tiny company as a designer. In the end too much luck in card draws involved with the meaningful decisions left out of the play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a good game. It's definitely very thematic. As long as people are willing to negotiate, it's a good game. The one minor quibble is that the role selection mechanic is a bit broken in it's most basic form. There's a more-or-less better balanced version that I house rule and has been mentioned in the forums.

It can get a tiny bit longer than I'd like, but still a good game.

City Council is nearly very good indeed.  It's one of those interesting games in which players are in competition, but must also cooperate to a degree to prevent the system from defeating everyone.  In City Council both pollution and crime have to be kept in check while we selfish politicians pursue our own agendas.   

City development is nicely handled with new buildings nominated and voted on, possibilities of overbuilding ("Noooo you can't demolish the diner!"), and extra costs for building in the wrong neighbourhood.  The importance of full employment, the problems of pollution and the value of community spirit are all nicely simulated.  

So why not a higher rating?  First, the system for allocating and re-allocating positions on the council tends towards an unhealthy stasis.  Second, the secret goal cards seem unbalanced.  What's more, there is no incentive to score many of them before the game's end, hence  opportunities to balance the luck of the draw by putting cards back into circulation are lost.

Production quality is good and the artwork is quite pleasing.

Firstly, I'm not a fan of co-op games.  However this was co-operation only with regard to the common agenda, principally of avoiding over pollution, but with the separate self-interest element of fulfilling your individual objective cards.  I am also not a fan of games where you are partly at the mercy of drawing helpful (objective) cards which in this case may or may not tie in with the buildings that become available.  I did warm a little to the game as it went on (and on), but largely due to the card draws rather than the players abilities it was clear by the penultimate turn who would win and who would be last.  I was in a clear 2nd (of four positions).  I had the opportunity of 'nuking' the game by requiring that an 8th pollution cube was placed.  Is it better to come second or for all players to lose?  Interesting question.  I decided that latter was a bit too negative so passed up the opportunity.  On balance was pleased to have played, but there are other games (offering less luck and more individual control) that I would rather spend my time with.

The idea behind this game is absolutely brilliant: force players to consider, as a group, how they are going to build a city while secretly working to advance their own positions. I don't think I've ever played a game that so closely mirrored/mocked political life by encouraging players to play the roles of lying, corrupt, and self-serving politicians. Within the first turn you'll find yourself arguing for the worthiness of one building over another ("No, a police station will help us later on!" - "Our city needs a school! How else will we get white-collar business to thrive here?"), just because you want to score a point or two. Ah, politics.

I have a couple of problems with the game, though. First of all, semi-coops are always a mess because they confuse the goal of the game and force people to lie about their motivations, which I'm never a fan of. With that said, however, I actually think this particular game should be [u]more[/u] punishing as a semi-coop, because after three or four turns your city thrives just fine without your intervention, so the once-real debates about improving the city quickly devolve into bald-faced competition, which takes a lot of the flavor (and much of the fun) out of the game. 

I also don't like that the lobbyist cards are dealt out randomly, because they tend to favor some players over others by sheer luck rather than any other factor. I'd love to see a bidding or drafting mechanic that enabled you to fight or strategize over the more advantageous lobby cards. It's a very interesting, but imperfect game.

I played this game for the first time with some friends a few days ago and we really loved it. The game encourages some fun negotiations, and I love how it forces the players to develop temporarily alliances in order to meet personal objectives. My only reservation with the game is that at times the rules seem a little vague. I wish there were more examples for some of the concepts in the game. This is especially true for changing committees in three and four player games. I have found the forum posts for this game really helpful in addressing some of these issues. Regardless, I really have enjoyed this game so far and would definitely recommend it to friends and family.

remains a good game after 4 or 5 plays, I do wonder about the play testing though. Most of these games were won by very similar objective card combos taking 4+ points in one turn. Seems like the most important thing is to the right card combo at the right time.

------------
only played once. Seems promising. It does nail the political underhand agendas and negotiations with its hidden objective cards. The rest of the game is engaging but its the hidden objectives that carry the day. The iconography is a bit small.

First play, at Essen. Only three rounds where the rules where not explained quite right at the booth.
Played it today for the first time but not before I made a checklist on what happens when during the 5 phases of the gameround. I can recommend to make such a player aid in order to keep track on what you are doing, or must do.
In all it was a nice first impression playing it with three players. Get the feeling it gets more interesting with 4 players. Hope to find out soon.

RATING: 7
 Played at Essen 2013 with four people. It seem like like a very good game, both mechanically and thematically. The game is a social game not a resource optimization one. It has a very interesting semi-cooperative mechanic. You are trying to build a city together while each player has several hidden agendas and gets points if they succeed their agendas. So it feels like a very realistic (albeit a cynical) simulation of a real-life municipality politics.

 Unlike a lot of other city-building themed games, save for some amount of money, players do NOT own anything. All the resources and buildings are owned by the city itself. You always have some conflict of interests between the players. If you are not careful, the city can turn into a crime ridden mafia city or an extremely polluted place where no one can live in which case all players lose the game. However, sometimes some players WANT the crime rate to be increased since they are backed by the local mafia, or they want to justify the construction of a bigger police station in the next turn.

 The artwork of the game is ok but it could use a better touch. Also, the gentleman on the booth has explained the game quite clearly and enthusiastically.

I actually deal with city councils every day in my work. This is a surprisingly semi-accurate representation of how that system works.

As the game is published a 3 rating:

Surprisingly tactical and capricious. Essentially you draw cards and then try to accomplish them; however, in order to achieve the majority of your tasks you're going to need the help of others who may or may not have similar cards in their hand. It isn't uncommon for nothing to work out for you or for everything to fall into your lap based on a) what others may have drawn or b) later stages in the game when the requirements have already been met. Plays best with 5; however, at that number it runs 2hrs plus and is highly chaotic. 

House rules rating 6:

Election variant: to cut down on the random, accidental scoring in favor of longer-term strategy around lobby cards.
- Play the game to eight rounds, scoring at the end of rounds 4&8.
- At the beginning of round 1 each player draws 5 lobby cards. These cards can only be exchanged via the union action (1 new card for 1 in hand). 
- After scoring in round 4 and at the beginning of round 5, discard all lobby cards and draw 5 new ones.
- Lobby cards that have already been fulfilled (buildings, zone-fills etc.) must be exchanged for new ones.
- When arranging the other players via the election committee, the chairman may arrange all B players in any way he sees fit.
- The game ends after scoring in round 8.

This game is good but it feels like it is missing something.  I feel that two of the positions are over powered and it would be better it positions were bid on with points.  Maybe all players start at 11 points - game finishes at 22 and points on favour cards are doubled.   Players who wish to change bid but if a player is displaced and they are on slot A, then they receive compensation points.,, just an idea.  I haven't tested it or explored further.

City Council is a unique semi co-op in which players take on the role of city councillors.  In it you must work together with other members of council to grow the city, and make it prosper.  However, there are special interest groups whispering in council members' ears.  If you can fulfill the agendas of these groups (who have come to you in the form of cards in your hand) then you will score points.  So, players must balance what is best for them, with what is best for the city as a whole.  If the city isn't properly maintained everyone loses.

City Council allows for some good negotiation and sly play.  It's also fun to try and weigh what is good for the city vs. what is good for you.  There's a fair amount to watch out for.  Players need to provide enough jobs for both blue, and white collar workers.  They need to make sure crime and pollution are kept in check.  Also, the city coffers have to have enough money, and power generation needs to be maintained.

As the game progresses a wide range of building types become available to be constructed.  Each provides benefits (and sometimes drawbacks) to the city.  It's fun to advocate for the one you want built, and then to vote on it.  Usually, you want buildings built based on your special interest cards so you can rack up the points and win!

City Council is good fun, and I'd recommend trying it if you can.

I find this an interesting implementation of how a city council can work. The rules are long and not in all cases clear, but that's just a few loose ends that can be solved in the forum here. I enjoyed it quite bit and I am looking forward to more plays. Quite interesting how every player pursues his own secret agenda. Sometimes opponents do inexplicable actions, only to find out later that they fulfilled a card with that action (being lobby cards that fulfill needs of certain parts of their electorate).

The theme is what got me interested in this game in the first place.. i love the theme. That being said, the execution of the game is flawed. One card has the wrong icon, and the rotation for roles for 3 and 4 player games doesn`t work. 

It`s too bad, because this game could have been much much better. 

After a few games played, it's now permanently on the shelf.

What´s interesting about this game is the city building aspect but otherwise it lacks excitement - much is decided on the point scoring cards you receive and if the building selection favours them.

City Council is a city building/negotiation game. The good thing is that it works as a city building game, the bad is that it fails as a negotiation game.

The idea is neat. There might be a factory and a school that could be built, and you secretly get a lot of points if the factory gets built. So you try to convince the other players that the city needs a factory more than it needs a school.

But either the city really does need a factory, and then the player who randomly happened to be dealt the factory card scores big, or it doesn't, and then you really have no power to convince the other players otherwise. You might say to a player 'Hey, if you vote for my factory, I'll vote for your park', but that's pretty much all the leverage you have.

There's a lot of variation in that the order in which the buildings come out matters a great deal. In some games pollution will be an enormous problem with no effective ways to deal with it, in others it won't matter at all. Variation is usually fun, but it means there's no set progression in which the city develops, so there's not really a sense of urgency in that certain kinds of buildings need to be built at a certain point. You just play around a bit, and if you happen to have a 'no pollution' scoring card in the right game at the right time you're in luck. And in others it will be impossible to accomplish.

I feel it's a good sandbox-y game. The city developing aspect, with blue and white collar workers, unemployment, crime, power, pollution, money &c. is smooth, quick and easy. What feels lacking, underdeveloped and filled with rules problems and balance issues, is the player actions, choices and strategy side of the game.

If you like to build and vote and work with various kinds of buildings and see a city grow and that's enough for you, give this game a try.

But don't buy it for the negotiation, interaction, or the semi cooperative nature, or expect a game with a lot of strategy where the best player will win a tense fight. You have little control, less to base your decisions on, often players' choices won't matter at all and the random card draw will decide the winner.

I couldn't imagine a better game where the discussions, problems and intrigues of a city council were better simulated than in this game. We had a lot of fun ... it reminded us of backstabbing games like "Junta"! Moreover the components and the design couldn't be more suitable. Wonderful game and one of the seldom cases where the playing time information was right (normally our group needs at least the double time).
Give it a try, every play feels different! There can happen a lot of things ... who is reaching his hidden goals at first? Will all players loose together as the city is too polluted or there's too much criminalism? Work together or not - from case to case.

For me: An absolutely underrated and underappreciated game!

RATING: 5
This is a somewhat semi-cooperative game where players are members of a city council (go figure) all contributing to the growth of a city with the singular goal of appeasing as many of their lobbyists as possible.  I think there are a lot of great ideas in this package but it is way too rough around the edges to reach its potential.

The reason I say semi-cooperative is that if ever there is too much crime or pollution in the city each player loses but otherwise each player has their own lobbyists whispering in their ear and is attempting different things.  In fact, there is a certain balance to the city's economy and social status that you should try to achieve each turn or else the whole thing starts to slip and nobody will make any progress so you are forced to work together to create a cohesive ecosystem.

Each player has cards that represent lobbyists (I love how one of the groups that can lobby with the city council is the mob), they want different things from certain buildings built to certain resources collected and everything in between.  Each round players will get different offices within the council, each with their own power, and elect, vote, and build/upgrade/sell/move/power/activate buildings within the city to achieve these goals.

I do like how the game actually forces certain requirements on players each turn, much like a real government would, to prevent players from gaming the system too much to the detriment of the city.  For example, when the election committee breaks ties in votes and chooses which buildings to build he can never choose less than the maximum number of buildings to be built.  So if the budget only has 3 dollars in it and one building costs 3 and the other two cost 2 and 1, he has to build the 2 buildings even if he didn't want to or really wanted to build the 3-cost building for his own needs.

All of the above I actually like.  But it is all marred with some ugly pockmarks.  The biggest is the god-awful rulebook.  I've mentioned this in other games from the past year, but somewhere publishers and designers stopped putting any time, effort, money, or all 3 into producing a good rulebook.  This is the first step in getting people to like your game, people!  Somewhere along the line publishers and designers have started to rely more on the community finding issues, re-writing rulebooks, and posting FAQs to make a game more playable instead of putting the resources into testing and just printing a good rulebook.  This rulebook is atrocious, the setup isn't in the front of the rulebook for one, one of the stupidest decisions you can make.  The first thing people need to do with any game after count the components (components list should always be the first few pages of the rulebook, stop printing it on the back of the box people!) is set up the damn game.  Then the sections are not clearly separated.  You know what else we need guys, we need to be able to quickly refer back to the rulebook to re-read or clarify rules...especially when the rulebook is this bad to begin with.  That's the other thing, everything that is written seems like they were cut off mid-sentence.  Nothing is explained clearly and the pictures don't actually provide any useful information.  There will be an example of a turn and the picture will just be of a tile.  Nothing showing what is being done on or with that tile, just a picture of the tile.  In what way is that helpful.

Alright, I'm not going to write 35 sentences on the rulebook but I could.  Suffice to say, that's the worst part.  I actually owned this game for months without playing it because it was so bad.  I had to have another player in my game group watch run-through videos and set up my own game for me.  But there are other things wrong with it too.  I already don't typically like games with very little points to go around and this is one of those.  This is exacerbated by the fact that you only score through lobbyist cards and those cards are random with you getting very few through the game.  I certainly felt like the winner of this game is going to be the person who gets the best cards by chance.  Or who gets the right cards for the random order and assortment of tiles available.  In my first game of this I started with one card that needed 3 different buildings built, I only SAW one of them the whole game and another card that needed money to run low and the first several buildings built all produced money.  That's just dumb luck, nothing I can do.

I will reiterate I like the council cooperation and the balancing of the city economy and social structure.  I think that is done well and I even like the idea of the different buildings producing different goods and doing different things for the city.  A lot of it is even really thematic.  There are just too many mechanical problems in this game that it's too much of a clunker to deal with.  Besides, a friend owns a copy so if I really need to explore this game again it's right there.

I heard some good things about this game and bought it because I liked the idea of majority votes what will happen with your town and try to influence the others to do what is best for you. But the game does not work. There are at least 2 options what could be done which makes no sense at all if you do not have the scoring cards for this actions. In other words they do not help develop the city and its prosperity. It is just to simple to build a city which runs and develops well and than it is pure luck if you draw the correct scoring cards.

Very innovative game that just needed a bit more time in development. If some of the rough edges had been smoothed out it could have been a 9.

Like FCoK this game has all the trappings of a good semi co-op but it is fundamentally flawed. None of the levers in the game provide any real control of the outcome and this makes the negotiation aspects less than interesting. Finally the card draws randomly and massively swing the outcome of the game. Avoid or just draw lots instead.

We played poorly on our first turn and never recovered.  Scoring with the cards seems random, but I understand how cards can fuel private agendas.  I'd play it again.

(A provisional 6, might go up or down a notch if I get to play this again.) A competitive co-op with tile laying & speaker action mechanics. This is one of those rare cases for me where a game looks & feels great before playing and after the first few turns, but the end result feels a bit indifferent. The concept is excellent, production values are good, and mechanics tried and trusted - but the end result seems to be a bit chaotic and you seem to have very little control over what you're trying to accomplish, no matter what you do. A nagging fault is one player getting a set of more than 1 similar VP card causing massive unexpected swings in VP (and triggering the game end). It's interesting enough that I would play this again, though.

This is a fun game, but it can be difficult to understand it because the rule book takes a few reads to really get what is going on. This game could really have used a player turn synopsis board thing for each player. The difficult rule book unfortunately drags down the start up experience. It also takes a game or two to really figure out how the money and buildings work so you know what you need and how far you can push being risky to obtain your hidden goals. All this aside, it's still a great game, but it could really use a do-over on some of these elements.

Kickstarted. The concept is irresistible: The players are members of a council who vote on what to build etc. in a city, while the players mainly want to serve their own interests.

The personal goals, which are the basis of your personal score, are drawn basically randomly from a deck. The designer has tried to be creative in providing a variety of different types of goals. Unfortunately, I just hate that. The goals are guaranteed to not be balanced in terms of how easy they are to get accomplished, or how likely it is that your moves will have a meaningful effect in accomplishing them. (Note how those aren't the same thing... A goal could be quite easy to achieve without the player having a direct means of trying to achieve it.)

The voting system is very eurofied/constrained. Basically you must nominate one proposal and second another, with no option to e.g. just second two proposals, or second and third a proposal, or second your own proposal. The outcomes then resemble the outcome of a semi-proportional voting method. You're never trying to assemble a majority coalition for a bundle of proposals, for instance.

My overall feeling is that there's not much feeling of control. There's not enough payoff (in terms of the effect of your moves) for putting the time in to figure out what proposals your goal cards direct you towards.

The game has a semi-cooperative aspect in that if the city is run too poorly, everyone loses. This has the usual theoretical problems with such designs. But here I also suspect it aggravates the player agency issue by adding a decision-making factor that is uniform for all players, not the product of anyone's individual incentives.

I'm having trouble rating this,  the customer service from the board game company is atrocious.  they stole 15 bucks of mine with nothing to show from it. Without the expansion solid 4.7!  Also the instruction manual is a complete disaster.

A very strange, yet interesting game, that suffers from scaling issues.  Played it with 3 and it wasn't that smooth, I suspect that it's going to be much much more interesting with 5.

essen 2013.

the learning play with 3 people at essen booth was hilarious and we all purchased the game. 
with its different worker placement mechanics and player interaction and (misleading them to your hidden causes) are what made me to buy this game.

this game was one the hidden and super undervalued games of Essen 2013. I strongly suggest.

This is a game I have fun playing in spite of its design. That is, while it's certainly a political game, you have no negotiating power. There's nothing you can offer each other, so unless you have the right position on the city council to allow you to execute your plan, then you're basically screwed. This was quite funny to us. Someone all of a sudden suggest selling a building, but everyone else knows that the only reason they suggest this is to score points.

I found it insane that the rules as written for switching city council positions are completely broken, was this even playtested at all? We quickly came up with a house rule solution, to simply switch the minimum players plus one (i.e. all players in the B position plus one in the A position).

The scoring cards are also a problem. They are very random and seemingly unbalanced. Some are clearly much better early in a game, while others are better later, and while they score the same number of points some are very difficult to score and others dirt simple.

Overall, I'll still play this again. It's certainly an imperfect design, but fun despite itself. It's a casual, laugh-filled, and laid back play experience.

I really like SimCity the computer game... and there have been very few board games that do that theme well for me.  City Council has hidden agendas, negotiation, voting on top of the city building with tiles on the board so this really might be a great hit for me. As an added bonus its a semi-cooperative game where everyone needs to try and get the city running well with the shared buildings we've voted on. I kickstarted this as it was from a small company and I wasn't sure how readily available it was going to be.  It arrived and I hope to try it out soon!

A nice semi co-op worker placement.  I personal feel the game is best with four to five players but can be played with less.

Really great gameplay idea. But a few flaws: 

Election committee changing positions drives to a distinct positiong in the council.

Random draw of VP-Cards could be very unbalanced

In a 3/4-player game only one proposal does not get build makes decisions in planning phase a bit weak.

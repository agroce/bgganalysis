RATING: 9
Lots of fun to play, I think historical weather is the way to go though, otherwise early storm turns can make it really tough on the Brits. Perhaps the coolest mechanic is the reinforcement table for the Allies, there's quite a bit of strategy and planning that can be well rewarded or punished for the allied execution of reinforcements. It's a blast to play as the Germans since the system rewards attacking, an aggressive German player has a good chance of winning the game in Caen with the elite panzer units savagely mauling the 2nd Army. It's really three games in one, the Germans outmatch the British in the east where the fight is arguably a meeting engagement, they are roughly equal in the center where the Germans fight a mobile defense, and the Germans are hopelessly outclassed in the west where they must delay as long as possible but face inevitable and total destruction. If played well, it should come down to the final turn and be a very close game every time. Great design, balance, and overall aesthetics.

Fantastic game. Accurately portrays operation Overlord with just the right amount of complexity and chrome. My only gripe would be the game outcome hinges significantly on the weather. Stunning counters and map, and elegant design make this game a permanent part of my collection.

RATING: 5
Desarrollo del mes de junio de 1944 en Normandía.
Sistema original un poco lento y farragoso en cuanto a las zonas bond y la determined defense. Por ello recomiendo simplificarlo.
Creo que tiene mejores críticas que las que merece, ya que a veces es algo repetitivo y con pocas oportunidades para los aliados si no se reforma.

This is the most beautiful map I've ever seen in a hex & counter war-game.

The game is another excellent entry into a great series.
Pretty well balanced, with many tense and match defining moments on both sides.

I believe the variability created by the varying weather will make very different matches every time.

RATING: 6
En contra.

- La escala temporal y espacial no funcionan en este juego. Debido a ellas, se convierte en un enfrentamiento estático a más no poder y en el que avanzar un hexágono o retrocederlo es la dinámica habitual. Muy poca movilidad. En ocasiones no sabes si en realidad es WWI en lugar de WWII.

- Estrategias muy obvias y monótonas. El alemán forma su línea de pilas y zoc-bounds y el aliado la suya... y así hasta el final de la partida. Salvo desalojar Cherburgo el resto es una guerra de trincheras sumamente aburrida. Carece de chispa y de emoción ninguna. 

- Tampoco me gusta el límite de factores en un ataque, me parece una regla absurda y poco justificable con nada. Creo también que se ha complicado en exceso el cálculo de los ratios de combate debido a los modificadores varios que se pueden aplicar... eso ralentiza el juego demasiado y consigue que dure en exceso para lo que ocurre realmente en el tablero.

- La batalla de normandía se queda completamente a medias. Aunque si lo prolonga más turnos sin cambiar nada más estaríamos hablando de muuuuchas horas de juego. Supongo que por eso lo acortó.

- En la primera edición las reglas de tiempo atmosférico son absurdas. Si salen demasiadas tormentas el aliado tiene imposible cumplir sus objetivos.

A favor.

- La estética de tablero y counters es muy bonita. Lástima que el juego sea tan plano.

Great system. My favourite Simonitch game. Seems very dependent on the weather after a couple of plays but that also adds to its replayability. Best D-Day game I've played so far.

Brilliant little game..perennial Normandy game problem of complicated initial landing mechanics beautifully solved by the simple introduction of a dedicated invasion combat table..no odds to compute just historical levels of difficulty for each beach incorporating a'Bloody Omaha' rule..'desperate defense' rule ensures lots of hedgerow horror for allies while 'Jabos' bedevil Germans..I've become a real Simonitch fan lately and this game simply reinforces that..

Initial Impression: After my less than enthusiastic feelings about The Caucasus Campaign, I was hesitant to try out this game. I'm glad I took the chance to experience it. The game is riveting, with a wonderful balance between rules complexity and ease of play. I particularly enjoy the classical rules involving ZOCs and supply lines mixed with new ideas such as the ZOC bonds. With most information summarized on the charts and player aids, there's very little rules referencing to do. By the 3rd turn, the game flows effortlessly. Having only experienced the campaign game, I'm eager to try out the scenario. This experience gives me hope that I will be able to enjoy other most other Simonitch designs.

RATING: 5.5
Pretty good game with a chaotic first third followed by a grinding static slugfest.

If the Germans don't win by Auto victory before GT 10, they are very likely (if not certain) to lose on points.

I would make the Allies lose VPs for each eliminated 3-steppers at least.

Also, Clear and Storm weather has a big impact. Too many storms pushes the Allies over the edge and not enough gives them a cushion. I would find a way to balance that.

Otherwise plays well, gives decent results, feels right, scale works well.

REVISION: After another play of the short scenario, which still clocked at 1 hour per turn, I must add that the amount of details, exceptions and special items is too high. There are just too much needs to go check in the rules, the play aids are incomplete. I am revising my rating down, I doubt I will play again.

My BGG history says I have 3 plays of this, but I'm pretty sure I have several more. Anyway, it's surprising to me how long it took me to really warm to this game, given that I'm such a big fan of Mark Simonitch's work. It's finally really grabbed me though - great pacing, lots of game tension, perfect scale, lots of decisions for both sides, a good deal of thrust-and-parry. Breakout: Normandy is the definitive operational/logistical game on this topic, but Normandy '44 is the definitive operational/tactical game.
---
I've raised my rating after some more play, because I feel Normandy '44 is in fact doing something distinct and interesting and captures stuff that Breakout: Normandy doesn't. I like Normandy '44 a lot, it's not quite as playable as The Caucuses Campaign but is still quite clean by the standards of these things. Weather die rolls are not quite as swingy as they look, but they can be high-stakes and if you're playing a short, 1-week game you might want to use the historical weather.
---
Played once, it's the usual Mark Simonitch stuff, great, clean-playing, and evocative. But ... it seems like every Normandy game turns into a bit of a tweezer-fest at some point, between Caen, the bocage, and the flooding. Normandy '44 succeeds admirably at keeping the pace of the game going, keeping the counter density reasonably under control, and keeping the feel right. Despite being a fraction of the size of the true Normandy monsters, though, it's still a bit dense. I enjoyed it quite a bit and rate it highly, and think it's a very well-done game.  I think the problem, though, is that Breakout: Normandy really showed how this campaign could be done in an interesting and novel way, and is such a wonderful, evocative, and authentic game. While Normandy '44 is a good game, it also seems to demonstrate why Breakout: Normandy had to exist.

Just got it in, looks awesome. Been enjoying the heck out of The Caucuses Campaign, and of course Mark Simonitch is hugely reliable. Greatly looking forward to playing this one.

A great disappointment, given how much I've enjoyed some of Simonitch's previous designs that share many features of this game. This doesn't feel like Normandy in June 1944. The Allies land, and then they simply move forward at about three times the historical rate. There seems to be nothing that the Germans can do, since they lack the strength to defend sufficiently strongly all along the line, and certainly to launch effective counterattacks. Step losses hardly affect the Allies, who can easily cycle fresh/rested units into the line, and in any case the success of their attacks relies far more on their support factors; a low-odds attack is no real hindrance.

Both games that I've played have seen the Allies reach the historical position at the end of June, just two or three weeks ahead of schedule. No particular luck, nothing we could see that the Germans could do to prevent it. Worse still, there are very few interesting decisions for the Allies to take: they simply follow the formula each turn and move quickly forward.

A very dice roll dependant. Weather roll is especially crucial for the game - Germans have no chance to win Campaign scenario unless there is storm or overcast weather in 2/3 game turns. Nice and clever mechanics, attrition battle is perceptible. Too long for a Campaign (22 turns lasts min. 12 hours gameplay).

Un jeu décevant, plus très certainement aux particularités de cette campagne, qu'au jeu en lui-même.
Le système est bien ficelé et les composantes historiques de cet épisode parfaitement simulées...pourtant au bout d'un temps, on s'ennuie ferme. Les Alliés composent leurs piles de 18 point de force en accumulant le maximum de soutien...Ils espèrent un résultat DH ou D1/D2 pour pouvoir exploiter...et c'est tout.
Les possibilités stratégiques sont faibles mis à part pour l'Allemand qui devra colmater mais aussi se montrer agressif.
Un jeu à la faible rejouabilité, étriqué et trop long...pas mon type de jeu...

Very deep, rich game. It's depth in capturing very realistic aspects of decision making and organization of forces along with it's breadth in having multiple, simultaneous fronts in action each with its own unique issues on a single map is remarkable. The map is simply gorgeous; the best looking, most functional game map I've ever seen. And the map looks even better during the game with the very nice looking counters showing the progress of the battle.

Unusually, this is an ideal game for 3 people: 1) U.S., 2) Commonwealth, and 3) German. I find myself splitting each phase of the allied turn into a U.S. sub-phase and a commonwealth sub-phase, not to execute things out of sequence, but rather to ensure that each Allied Army sector gets the attention it needs.

Really the only "monster" wargame I've ever played, at least in the traditional sense, and a relatively small one at that.  I've only ever played solo, but I've found it very replayable.  For me, at least, this doesn't really scratch the "gaming" itch as much as it does my "World War II" itch.  When I bring this out, it's as an exercise in history, more than a desire to play a game, but it remains a great, balanced piece of wargame design, with top-notch components to boot.

A beautifully crafted and accessible take on the legendary battle at the operational (regimental, mostly) scale. Covers early part of the campaign, from the initial landings to just before the fall of Cherbourg. Allies have more men, materiel and fire support, but must deal with supply problems as well as fickle weather.  Germans have a mix of elite and substandard units, and are vulnerable to Allied air attacks.  These, along with invasion actions, supply and replacements/reinforcements are elegantly modeled, without rules clutter.

Seems at first a stacked deck against the Germans, but the “Determined Defense” rules and victory conditions favor them.  They can pick their spots to counterattack, and it doesn't hurt to get some help from the weather gods.  Americans should push hard and fast on Cherbourg while methodically expanding the Omaha beachhead.  In Monty’s sector use the Canadians to batter against Caen, but watch British infantry casualties.

Asymmetric situation and lack of hidden units lends itself to solo play. Rules for ZOC “bonds” and Reserve Movement/Combat make more sense the more you play. Thorough, well-organized rulebook, gorgeous map and counters. A brilliant design.  Look forward to trying more in this series.

Fine simulation of the most interesting part of the battle of Normandy. Well balanced, the weather determination at the start of each turn make the profile of the game (will the Allies have supply and sun to lauch their planes over german panzerdivisonen ?)  so each play is different.
Intense, easy to learn but not simplist, a reasonable game about time of play, map size and number of counters.
I don't need an other game about battle of Normandy now.

RATING: 5
Tentative comments after 1 partial play. Not sure what to make of it yet, but initial impressions were not that good. The landings don't appear to provide any sort of tension. The Allies seem to be able to land and breakout with little to no risk.

As others have mentioned, it seems the Allies can move at a much more brisk pace than happened historically, especially in the center. The game also seems to suffer badly from "must be played a certain way" on the German side, caused in part by the relatively low unit density, and requires gaming the ZOC/bond rules, or an experienced Allied player will crush you.

Like [i]The Caucasus Campaign[/i] I think this is a game best played solitaire.

Excellent quality as always from Simonvich and GMT.  Played 3 times solitaire and pretty good game.  started to get bored with it after about 6-8 turns.

Still I won't be selling this game, it seems it will be a classic for years to come.

Another Mark Simonitch winner. Good level of detail but manageable for an evening's play (i.e., not a monster.) 

However, there's a bit more overhead here compared to The Caucasus Campaign - ZOC bonds are back, special invasion rules and bits about flooded hexes and hexsides. Although the overhead is comparable to A'44, perhaps my tolerance is not as high, or I've been spoilt by Breakout: Normandy.

-------------------------------------------------

The second best game of Normandy I've found (Killing Ground/Overlord being the best)

It covers the situation of the first month rather faithfully. The same old mechanichs of a classic wargame but with enough differences in them to represent the different kind of battle that Normandy was, a battle of material and logistics instead of a battle of generals.

The german is hard pressed during all the game and any slight mistake can be fatal, but for the allied player is not a piece of cake either and must perform better than the historical outcome in order to win, he must isolate Cherbourg and advance further the historical line or make a clear breakthrough in the german line. In order to perform the allied is nearly always pressed to attack every turn and must plan his offensives very carefully. 

The components are superb and the rules very clearly written.

Only drawbacks I can find is first the weather roll is very important and many storm and heavy overcast turns can ruin the allied strategy not being able to land reinforcements and not using his air and naval assets and second is that I'd like this game expanded to cover all the campaign, when I finished my first play I wanted to continue further.

Great game indeed, and possibly to become a classic.

This is a solid but flawed game on a hard topic to simulate. For one, Normandy was a grueling affair, and battles of attrition are just not as exciting. Furthermore, if a Normandy game becomes too fluid too fast then every grognard will wring their hands and rightfully so.

This one is good but the rules overhead is a little much for what it is. More importantly, I think the game is fairly balanced but the German learning curve is steep.

This is a rendition of topic gamed too many times with classic means--a rendition that still feels fresh and plays well mostly due to simple rules that allow players to explore instead of bogging them down in plethorea of onerous (and irrelevant) minutae.

Of the few gripes that are worth highlighting, I need to mention:

* German performance depends too much on the weather which is randomly determined each turn--a streak of unlucky rolls can thwart German plans to the point where they have no chance of winning;
* stale frontline (something that can be hardly avoided given the scale);
* German AV very hard to achieve (or rather it is too easy to counter any attempts).

Uno de los mejores wargames que he probado hasta la fecha y dispongo de bastantes. Desde el apartado gráfico, que es precioso, hasta las mecánicas de juego como las "cadenas" (hex/hexside bonds) hacen de este juego uno muy cuidado y repleto de detalles que le dan una gran ambientación y realismo histórico. 

No es difícil de aprender a jugar aunque tiene situaciones muy particulares - como las reservas o el método de retirada/avance - que pueden crear cierta confusión hasta que se le coge la mano al juego.

Para ponerle alguna pega, el alemán apenas puede hacer nada en la mayoría de turnos excepto ajustar sus fuerzas y tapar huecos, con algún que otro contraataque puntual. Además, el jugador alemán depende mucho del tiempo atmosférico y si hace buen tiempo supone un hándicap importante, ya que puede mover menos por la presencia de la aviación aliada. Y otra pega, aunque esta ya depende del punto de vista de cada uno, es que llega un momento en el que el bocage y la defensa tenaz alemana pueden convertir todo el frente en una ciénaga pantanosa, con pocos avances y combates sangrientos, con lo que se pierde el impulso de los primeros turnos donde el movimiento es más fluido y hay más exigencia a la hora de decidir dónde colocar los refuerzos.

No obstante, desde el punto de vista estratégico, el juego es muy retador para ambos bandos y debido a la poca densidad de unidades y contadores los turnos fluyen rápidamente. Ambos jugadores deben pensar muy bien dónde realizar sus movimientos y aunque haya poco que mover cada uno de esos movimientos puede ser clave.

Resumiendo, un juego de dificultad media, con poca densidad de fichas y que ofrece retos muy jugosos a ambos bandos. Un wargame muy aconsejable tanto para veteranos como para novatos en el género y eso sin dejar en ningún momento de intentar simular el desembarco con rigurosidad y mecánicas muy logradas.

Fairly conventional hex-and-counter stuff with a couple of nice tweaks already seen in previous Simonitch games.

It's somehow lacking the tension of other Normandy games, as the overall situation is an absolute win-win scenario for the Allies right from the start, with landings being a sure and almost safe thing and no real chance for any significant German resistence or counterattack at the beaches (80% or their strongpoints are purely decorative) or during the first few turns. 

As a result, the rather fluid situation of the first 2-3 weeks of the historical campaign is almost missing in the game.

Besides, the tactical decisions for both sides are very much predictable. The Germans need to reach 10 combat factors to secure a 1:1 ratio that the Allies will automatically shift to a minimum of 3:1 or 4:1 thanks to a mix of Air, Naval or Armor Support, Troop Quality, and Field Artillery. Rinse and repeat over and over and over again.

As a result, the Allied rate of advance is much faster than historical (especially in the middle of the board) and both Cherbourg and Caen can be flanked rather easily by mid-game.

Last but not least the weather rolls can have quite an influence during the first few turns of the game, as a Clear result (50%/66% chance from turn 3 on) will significantly slow German reinforcements. OTOH, a Storm result (16%/33% chance) can also have quite an impact on Allied replacements.

All in all, pretty disappointing.

This is a near perfect wargame for me. It has a low counter density, one map sheet and a rulebook that can be memorized after one play. I'm not a big fan of Igo/Ugo as I find the system a bit dated but having a small number of counters on the map makes for short turns.

So far, only a solo play of the Cherbourg scenario, but I continue to love the tried-and-true Simonitch system (ala France '40).  Great playability with ample chrome to make the gaming experience for this battle unique.  A fantastic map makes playing very enjoyable.  N44 can feel a bit like a plodding WWI battle at times, but in many ways that is how it was.  As a result, it lacks a bit in the "Gaming Excitement Department" for me.  Nevertheless, it is very well done and worthy of a few playings.

Not a campaign that massively interests me at the operational level (I want to be down in the hedgerows!) but, being a Simonitch game, this has the well designed and well written rules and attractive, functional components we've come to expect. There's a fair amount of chrome but nothing too taxing and everything is fairly intuitive.

RATING: 9
Great, great game. This exceeded my wildest expectations. A kind of modified Ardennes 44 system, it is much more intense and interesting than the other Mark Simonitch games I've played. There are a couple stilly things particularly the gap between units and the incentives around it, but generally speaking I really like the game.

RATING: 7
initial rating, should be taken with much salt, I normally rate games pretty objectively but this one more reflects just how much the system matches my preferences (not that well)

The main thing for me with this title was I felt there were too many rules for what it was and it was too long (for me), number of pages was at top of my limit but damn those pages were dense with rules and the 25 seemed more like 35. I really like how close its trying to sim the events (I thought the inclusion of bicycles were a neat touch), I just dislike how many exceptions are put in place to do it. 

Other than that, the beach landing phase was the most fun for me by far, and after this I just felt the game moves along at a really slow grinding pace (even though that pace is faster than historical, its just slow in game for me with very carefully plotted out moves on the whole board each turn), and for a really long time (30 or more hour campaign game is just too long for me). 

I have acquired Breakout Normandy and have gone through those rules and think that I will like that system a little more overall, and I am also looking to acquire Liberty Road which also looks much more to my preferences. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, here I think the strength is the sim, and while I want a good dose of sim, I prefer the balance be shifted slightly closer to the playability side which I think the other 2 do well.

RATING: 8
The Mark S operational system (Ukrane'43, Ardennes '44 and France '40) is the one of the best simulations of WWII operational level warfare.  Applied to Normandy '44, it captures both the steady attrtional grind through the boccage as well as the possible breakouts (rare though exiting!)  This keeps the German player on his toes, forcing him to be dynamic in his defense. Only a few issues, one the game takes awhile to play, 22 turns! and the learning curve for the German player is more diffilcult. After all, the Allies can make many unsuccesful attacks and still have a chance ...it only takes a couple of German mistakes to break open the game.

I wanted to try Simmonitch game. I was hoping for something really good. I must say that in the end I did not enjoy it at all. 

This is one of those games where I feel like I am playing system (rules) and not using logical war tactics.

Things like voluntary disbanding of fortresses, ZOC bonds, etc. are too unintuitive for us.

Game is a lot of fun, and I love the historical detail.

Update: Still not sure if I can give this a fair rating. I like it, but the game stagnates very easily. Not sure if that's an issue I have with the game, or the scale. I like the limit to combat factors, but it also has the downside that a lot of units (especially in the Caen area) have nothing to add to a combat.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
A game where the germans never have enough units, the allies have plenty of them; but thanks to clever rules (CRT, Determined Defense...) each hex can be a debacle for the attacker.
Plus the 3 player possiblity is a thumbs up.

RATING: 9
Gorgeous map art...high solitaire playability...Mark Simonitch...only 1 map...perfect wargame!  Haven't had a good D-day game in years...this one is a must.

I am happy to report my copy of Normandy '44 arrived after pre-order in Sep last year.  The game is a regimental scale treatment of the Allied invasion on a single standard size map of the Normandy area.  3 scenarios.  The scale looks right to me and I am more familiar with the names in the area after long time playing the PC game Company of Heroes and the scenarios in board wargame Band of Brothers.  I also stare at my French game Liberty Road and the just released monster The Battle for Normandy (our group of 8 is going to play this monster game in December)...plus all Dan Holte's (the same designer of Battle for Normandy) mini games June and August '44. I feel right home to the area.

After playing the game, I can say it is really an excellent, fun, entertaining and mind-blowing experience - that the game is seamlessly integrating all the important strategic elements in an amphibious operations. From the initial landing of the troops, expansion of the beachhead, taking out enemy garrisons inside the bunker, airdropping in-lands, securing strategic towns and cities, defending supply lines, calling and mustering air, naval and artillery support assets, combined arms between infantry and panzers, to the integrity of the fighting formations....seeing all the obstacles, terrain or otherwise, being overcome one by one. I always find myself wanting more playing of this game.  An instant classic.  This one game satisfies all firey desires!

What is more, the VASSAL engine for the game is already ready and posted.  The sequence of play of the game is perfectly suitable for VASSAL PBEM play, where one side do all the stuffs first and then the other side.  I am beginning to do this as we finished 2 game turns in a session and continue the game with VASSAL.  GMT really care about the customer value of their games!

Love the rules as it has a few little tweaks on the norm to make it interesting. All the victory conditions are possible to reach out and grab and the germans while just looking to hold on as much as they can, can sneak in some victories.

The beach landing sequence is simple but effective, as is the paratrooper landings. Weather system works well too.

Everything just works beautifully together. And it is fun to see how well you do compared to history as it is noted in the turn track.

Highly recommend.

An absolutely beautiful presentation.  The map is functional and easy on the eyes.  Many charts on the map without detracting from its utility.  The 5/8" pieces (or are they 9/16"?) are easily readable and with historically appropriate colors.  The "old-school" touches like the At Start and Reinforcement cards make setting up and inventorying pieces a breeze.

The game play is great too.  It's very tough on the Germans to be aggressive early and then play for time thereafter with very limited resources, but the Allies are very much at the mercy of the weather and running against the clock.

After only one ftf campaign game, this rating could go either up or down. I like this system and the game but at the same time, the sheer number of chrome rules pushes my diminishing memory to the breaking point.

As far as production quality, everything is superb. Map, counters, rule book and play aids are all top-notch. And while all the chrome rules had me and my gaming partner constantly scouring the rule book, never once were we unable to find the answer.

Update: In the end, more chrome than my memory could handle. Sold.

A very good game.
Nice component and interesting system.
I've already played it (the small scenario) a couple of times and enjoyed it.
I wonder how the whole campaign looks like.

I could have rate it higher but I think that the rules are sometimes not easy to read (or to find an information in) and another Player Aid card with more details about combat would have been helpful.

After several plays, i finally lower my rating as I think that random weather is really a mistake and can even spoil completely a game.

There is surely a good game in there, if you can stand the very one sided situation.

For sale (preferred) or trade.   Looks good but I lost my wargaming friend and am reducing my game collection.  // After 2 sessions reading the rules, it seems much more complex and fiddly than I expected and I doubt I'll get this to the table soon.  Seems like every unit (piece) has its own special fine print qualities for movement or combat.  Looks like excellent production quality and a great game, and when I retire in a few years maybe I'll have time to learn and play it.

This is the BEST wargame I've ever played. Great map (based on a Normandy Michelin map), great counter art and great rules. Regimental level with armoured battalions and some infantry battalions. Excellent ZOC Bond rule - could introduce this to every other ZOC game as it really alters the way things go. Played it several times and loved every game. Bit difficult for the Germans to win and very easy for them to lose. Will definitely play again and again. If they made every WW2 game in this scale with these rules, I'd play it :)

Not a bad attempt at a simulation of the Normandy action.  It just did not really grab me like I hoped it would.

This is another Mark Simonitch wargame based on [b]Ardennes '44[/b]. The abnormal artefacts from ZOC bonds significantly affect tactical positioning, but the overall affect is largely historical. For example, you can seemingly surround a unit, only for those units to be surrounded themselves through a weird artefact. In many cases it's better not to defend a hex because the ZOC bond is invincible and serves as an invisible garrison for the intervening hex.

The Allies struggle to breakout from their beachheads after outrunning naval fire support. The Allies have to be careful not to go down to 5 British or 7 US cadres, otherwise they'll automatically lose the game. The Cherbourg perimeter is quite the grind, but it's worth 9 VP. There's really no point not to go for Cherbourg, since the sudden death victory conditions for the Allies are impossible. You must have an in-supply unit touch the other edge of the map [i]and[/i] hold all four hexes of Caen—you'd be lucky to get even a [i]single hex[/i] of Caen.

This game is all about earning column shifts in combat (e.g. armour, troop quality, and artillery shifts) to take hexes and determined defence rolls to hold onto hexes. The determined defence basically functions like a free attack in close terrain, because the chance of failure is so low with all the modifiers and you can deal step losses to the attacker if you roll high enough. The level of replacements is so high that units that've taken losses simply spontaneously regenerate before your very eyes, the only downside being the phasing player can't attack out of that hex.

Played solo a couple of times and via vassal . Game components are very good and the map is fantastic.  Rules are reasonably easy to digest with the ZoC bond being a great idea.  Gameplay is a simple Igo Ugo affair but the game plays very well indeed.  Challenging for both players but the German player needs to be be on his best game and look for those counter attack chances.  Too long for playing in an evening, needs a couple of sessions to complete so its unlilkely to see the table in its paper form.  Plays very well on vassal though.

Love the system. I have found it to simulate the conflict very well, which is a mixed blessing. The nature of the conflict means for a large part of the game there is very little maneuvering as the Allies try to punch a hole through the German frontlines at the beachheads. And once they do, it often bogs down again at Caen. It will break wide open at a certain point in the game, but if that happens, it spells doom for the Germans.

Still, its a great game. Beautiful components (especially the map) and a fantastic and streamlined system. I love the ZOC bonds and the Shifts-based CRT. 

I actually prefer to solo this because I like my Face-to-Face games to have much more maneuvering.

Some good if not great ideas but overall fairly boring.

The beach landing are simple and work well, but after a few turns the game bogs down into 'trench' warfare. I suspect at this scale, this was inevitable.

The weather die rolls are too important to make this a fun/challenging game. I feel as if I'm fighter the weather die roll, rather than my opponant. Historically that is probably right, but it doesn't make a great game experience.

On the plus side it plays fairly quickly and can split very nicely into a four player game

I love this system - the ZOC bond concept works very well and gives more of a "front" feeling with the idea of needing to attack certain hexes in order to break down/get around defenses (rivers giving x1/2 is a killer) just feels right. For example - if the Germans hold St.-Clair-sur-'Elle the whole game which made the push on St. Lowe impossible due to the Germans holding the Elle River line and the Americans could generally only get 3:1 odds (and some poor rolls). This then allowed the Germans to reinforce as losses occurred.

This game was more complicated than I had hoped, not being a huge student of the Normandy campaign, but I don't want to rate it for what I wanted it to be. This is a richly detailed game with beautiful graphics. I generally don't rate games I haven't played a number of times, but this is clearly a high quality game, if you have an interest on the subject.

I only wish GMT's complexity ratings were a little more reasonable. 32 pages of rules with a boatload of additional charts is not a 5 complexity game for cripe's sake.

First of the 'XX Simonitch games I've seen, and pretty impressed so far. I'm also concurrently playing Holland '44 (in hopeful anticipation of a FTF game). The CRT seems appropriately bloody (even to attacker at "good" odds, though perhaps not quite far enough), and I really like the column shifts vs simple odds comparisons.

Rules are a bit more thorny than I'd anticipated from all the "smooth playing" remarks. Part of it is that I've been away from wargaming for a few years, but I do think there's some cruft and/or overexplanation going on (atk vs def armor shifts, retreat and advance some of the latter; different but nearly equal distinctions between statuses one of the former).

Still, pretty cool overall. Very excited about Ukraine '43, Holland '44, and maybe even Ardennes '44 despite my usual aversion to all things Bulge.

Another thought provoking game by Mark Simonitch; well worth the money.

My first ever wargame. Rules were a bit complicated for me as a newcomer - but many videos and insights helped. Great narrative. Having been in the Normandy in the past holidays it is the perfect game to get a feeling of the shocking things happened in this beautiful landscape meter by meter.

One partial play.  Solid system with just enough chrome to make things feel real.  Very playable.

Tiene azar y las estrategias son relativamente obvias, y el aliado parece tener bastante ventaja; y aún así el juego parece bien terminado y es divertido.

Normandy 44 is a very good wargame. One of my most played wargames actually. The airborne and landing rules are slick. It seems a little bit more difficult to play the Germans since the margin of error is smaller.

A hidden gem at GenCon 2015. The best game of the bunch that I picked up.

Update 2/8/2016- After several plays the games strategy continues to reveal itself. I have learned the joy of sitting on the "Stock Bust" cards, waiting until the last round, and then dropping them all on the most popular split stocks in the game. Muhahahahaha.....

Update 7/9/2016-  Raising my rating. This game keeps getting played and it keeps getting better.

4 plays / 4,5 players

LIKE: Simple idea, and putting one face-down card is entertaining. Plays quickly. Seeing the stock go up and down is fun and adds some drama. I did like trying to read other players to see what inside stock info they knew. Very interactive.

DISLIKE: Auction round and selling round can slow the game down due to another player's thinking. Some components were thin and bend easily. Player colors were wrong and did not match. Some randomness and luck, not a highly strategic game.

OVERALL: Can be fun! We played both sides of the board, and I think the advanced side of the board is needed to add that little extra edge to the game. Felt too random at times, therefore not a serious game.

it's a good game. every time i play this game with non-board gamer, it's a hit every time.

i have problem with expansion. the forecast cards of expansion are distinguished with backside color.
so i put 6nimmt card inside my sleeve. its a mess.
i dont like this looking.. please brett sobol,seth van orden, 
if you have a plan for next expansion, just read my description below.


i like expansion. except card backside color is different from base game.(i mean forecast card)
if they cant make backside of card same with base game, then just put replacement 6(forecast) card from base game. why they don't do that...?

Stockpile is a game that got mixed reactions from the people I introduced it to. Some of my die-hard strategy gamer friends responded quite coldly to its hard to control nature and they felt that the game was way too random. Other more casual-gamer friends instead gave me a big positive feedback, as they found all that swinging in the stock values to be very fun and especially exciting. I believe this says a lot about this game.

Stockpile is fun game and, in my opinion, an excellent gateway point to the hobby. It plays in a reasonable time, the rules are maybe a little long to explain but simple enough for new players, the components and the artwork is good and the concept of "get richer than the others" is something everyone is familiar with, having played Monopoly. In fact I believe this is the perfect "better game" to replace Monopoly with and to use to introduce people that like the old Parker Brother's game to the hobby of modern boardgames.

At the same time I see the point of my die-hard strategy gamer friends. The game is swingy and crazy and hard to control... but it just makes sense that it's like that! If you're searching for a strategy game, you picked the wrong box. This is a crazy and loud light game, which works perfectly with family and non-gamer friends and I'm glad to own a copy. Stockpile, thumbs up from me!

Great medium-light game! It's my husband's favorite game. He loves the theme, the art and the gameplay. We played with 2 and 4 players... and it was actually surprising for me that we enjoyed the 2 player variant a lot better. The reason is that the 2 private insider informations, the 2 meeples to bid and the 4 cards to put on the stockpile made the bidding war a lot more interesting for us. For some reason reason the 4 player was not as fun, the stockpiles didn't look as attractive, and people didn't fight as hard for them until the last few rounds... The only pro for the 4 player was the selling phase, being the last player and see what everyone else is gonna sell is what adds flavor to it. Even though the 4 player was not our favorite, we mostly play our games with 2 players anyway. So it isn't a con for us. I still highly recommend this game!

RATING: 7
1st play: We played on the basic side with no player powers.  The order of the stock boon/busts was surprising and I got hit with an early bankruptcy.  Other than that tho, the rules were very smooth, and once I understood that, it felt like it fit.  There's a big sense of chaos, but the goal is to take advantage of the bit of chaos you do know in order to get an edge on your competition.  The production is good (purple meeple aside) and I didn't feel like this game was a kickstarter.

2nd play: We played the advanced side, and some of the stocks are brutal, going bankrupt in a single turn.  Knowing what to expect and how to capitalize resulted in higher scores the second play.  I do wish there were more opportunities to buy individual stocks, but that would probably dilute the game.  Auctions for the lots of stocks works well and keeps the game zipping along.  We rarely play a game back to back, and this one was worth it.

The number of fiddly details for this game was quite large when it was explained to me.  I only grasped the game halfway through it.  I did pretty well anyway.

I suppose it would help the player to know stock trading terms.  I'm only vaguely familiar with them so some words didn't mean much to me until I saw them being applied during the game.

Limited information bidding game. This was fine to play. It's a bit annoying that there's two spots of blind play - you're bidding on (some) stocks you don't know that will (some) go in a direction you don't know. Looks like the advanced game would be much better.

I'm not usuaually a fan of stock market games but Stockpile is quick, simple and with enough variety to keep you interested.  Best with 4-5 and plays well inside the 45-60 min timeframe, even during the first learning game.

Limited information and the ability to influence some stock prices - leads to a fun game.  A large amount of luck also drives the prices and cards (stock) available.

Playing the base game is good, but it really comes into its own with the advanced board and the specialist player roles.  Not sure I'd ever buy a copy, but it was definitely a game I enjoyed and would happily play again.

A stock market game that is really easy to teach and learn in a short amount of time. The basic version works well and is fun on its own which I find to be a rare occurrence. The full version, however, with its variable player powers and each stock having a different price track really makes the game pop. It takes a play or two for people to catch on and see that they can start to stack decks against someone and try to lure them into taking a stock that you know is about to go bankrupt. Having that little bit of insider information adds a nice little twist to things.

Great little stock market game that doesn't bog down in minutiae.  I may not like the trend to slightly shorter games we have going on (seems what used to be 2 hour games are now 1 hour games), but if the new games are all as streamlined as this one, I can get behind it.

Fun, light economic game with a decent amount of strategy. Luck is present, but strategy is definitely there. More plays would reveal a higher strategy to luck ratio. The artwork is gorgeous with a early 1900's art deco sort of style to it. The game can feel pretty tense with auctions, and decisions seem to carry weight (especially selling). As long as no one is suffering too much from AP, the game plays pretty briskly. Pretty to look at, fun to play.

Solid yet none too heavy stock market game. There are six companies and each turn every player will have some private information about the movement of one stock, and there will be some public stock movement information available to all players. 
Players add cards to collective stockpiles of varying amounts of cards, some face-up and some face-down, which are then auctioned. 
From that flows a very decent game of bluff as you try to convince others to buy just as a stock collapses, or sell just before it rises.
Family-friendly, plays in an hour or so.

Initial Impression: Here's a wonderful game about insider trading that's done right. Though the game is a "stock trading game", the emphasis is on the insider information that you receive each round. This information aids in your decision about how to create the piles of market cards you will be bidding on. This game uses my favorite auction system, similar to that found in Cyclades, making the game flow quickly and smoothly. Other major decisions include when to sell shares and when to reveal shares in order to receive dividends. I enjoyed this game at 4 players and suspect that with this auction mechanism the game will work just as well with all numbers. Here's a stock game I can play with the whole family.

RATING: 8
This game is a lot of fun to me!  It gives you the feeling of stock trading without the heavy math.  And that is great because it moves fast, keeps snappy, and it is just wonderful having insider information.  It just keeps it pretty light but still really compelling to me.  Sometimes you'll just bankrupt and lose a ton of stock, but it never feels as bitter as it would in a heavier, mathier game.  I really enjoy it, especially with the added player "powers".

[8.6.17] UPDATE:  The people you are playing with make or break this game for me.  If I play with conservative bidders who do not push people to the edge for the different stock piles the game languishes.  However, a cunning group of players really unlocks the joy to be found in this game.  The game mechanics are wonderful and merit a 8 rating.  The game depending heavily on the people who play it for the game to shine merit a 6 rating.  Split the difference: 7.

[2.1.17] - After several plays, the play experience of this game relies heavily on the who you are playing with.  Similar to poker, this game forces you to focus on "who" you are playing against versus optimizing the game's mechanics.

Have now played this 3 times - with 3-4 players.  Although there are a few procedures to follow this is a really simple game with interesting strategies and opportunities for bluff, deduction etc.  There is a good mix of information everyone knows, no-one knows and information that only you know...but sometimes players actions can lead you to deduce more information.  It plays very quickly and I do feel that even playing this for the first time you have a decent chance of success although with repeat plays you can more quickly evaluate the different choices you have and know how to skew the lots of shares that you are bidding on.  If I didnt have problems with my memory I would probably rate this higher

This is a great hybrid of a stock market and bidding game. Each round, you get dealt cards and you seed various piles of cards. The cards can be stocks but there's also cards that let you change stock prices or just give you money. Since some of the cards are face up and others are face down, there's some nice hidden information at play too. Don't ever play this a)on the basic board side and b)without player powers.

Brian and I only played the 2 player variant. He won a rather close game, $227,000 to $222,000. you really need to take risks and be able to bluff well to do good at this. Brian was able to convince me to sell the yellow stock when he sold all of his while he had the card that made it go up to double at the end of the round. Bidding track is fun (I really like this mechanism). Another must play for Flo, as with her money skills, she would also enjoy and probably do well at this. Keeper!!!

Stocks! Don't go to sleep quite yet thought. This game handles a potentially complex, headache inducing theme (trading stocks) and turns it into a very streamlined game in which players, as inside traders, know a bit about where stocks are headed and can bid accordingly. Throw in some hidden knowledge and an auction mechanic, and you're left with a quick, fun game that engages the mind and makes the stock market fun for everyone.

Stockpile is truly one of the best stock market games I've played.  And, I mean stock holding games that attempt to resemble the market.  It feels like it gives just about the right amount of hidden and shared information between the players and enough randomness plus opportunity to read others to make for something good.  Of course, there is a fair amount of relying on others to do the right thing so that they can be correctly read.  I'll play it again.

The major downside to this game is that it's kind of structured like a social game, but there aren't really any reasons to talk much with the people around you. It more closely simulates trading stocks online than trading stocks on the floor of an exchange, so if that's what you're looking for, look elsewhere, but it is still an entertaining and engaging game.

Initial Impressions:
------------------------
I had heard this one was interesting from "The Secret Cabal" so I was pretty excited to give it a go.  Wow!  It did not disappoint.  This is a light game, but I like how you get your stocks by adding cards as a group to piles, and then you bid of them.  Some of the cards will be face down, and there could be some bad things in there that can get expensive.  I also like how you know some info about how the stocks will move, but you can kind of gauge how something will do by how others bid on stocks, and sell stocks.  I only played the normal side of the board, but the advanced side looks even more interesting, so I am excited to check that out!  I do wish you got more than 2 cards to play into the piles, but I can see why they limited it, as it does keep the game moving at a good pace.  A game I am very much interested to check out more going forward.

Adding some additional notes after a play with the expansion.  This was already a good game... but its even better with the expansion.  Really enjoy this one, and cannot imagine playing without the expansion at this point!

You are stock traders.  Your objective is to find opportunity to acquire stocks and get the most amount of return.  Your decision to buy the stock will be influenced by the insider information you have.

THINGS I FORGOT
Should pull six different stock cards and deal one to each player.
Flip one card face up for each of the stockpile.
If the Stock Split again, that player will gain $10,000 for each stock cards (not each stock) you have in your split stock portfolio.  (Meaning player will get $5,000 for each stock)

There are 6 companies in the game (Show the companies and name them)
Each companies will have their respective stock cards.  (Show to players)
Each of you will get $20,000 as your starting capital. (Have somebody distribute 3$5K, and five $1k bills)

In this game, you will be playing for X number of rounds
The value of the share is indicated by the stock ticker.
However, the value of these shares will change depend how the market moves which will be determined by these cards (show the cards)

Before we start the game, each player will get a board and the Meeples of the respective colors.  Each player will get 1 stock cards at random based on the six different stock cards that are pulled out.

In Each round, there will 6 phases,

Information - players will receive 1 company card at random and 1 forecast card at random.  This represent the inside information you have about the company.  You must not show these cards to other players.
Place one company card and 1 forecast cast on the board.  This will be public information.

Supply
Flip one card FACE-UP to build the stockpile under each calculator.
Each players receive two cards from the Market Deck.
You must keep this card separate from the stock card you have on the player board.
In turn order, each player place 1 card face up on any Stockpile and 1 card face down on any Stockpile.  Both cards can be in the same Stockpile.
Remember to check the information you have as this will influence how you place your stock cards.

Demand
Players that bid to determine which stockpile they want to go for.  If they win the bid, they get all the cards from the stockpiles.
During bidding, you can always ask other how much money do they have as money is public information.
Maximum bid is $25K.
(Note: When a player is outbidded, he or she does not need to (re)-bid on another stockpile)
So after all the bidding track have a bidding Meeples, pay the money to the bank and collect the stock cards.
NOTE: There are cards called Trading Fees, this mean you must pay the amount indicated immediately.  If you do not have enough funds, you must pay later once you receive money.
Stock cards collected/obtained will be kept secret on your Player Board

Action:
This is where players can play action cards.  There are two types of action cards.
Stock Boom and Stock Burst -> Stock Split and Bankruptcy case.  When you move the stock it may reach the end of the track resulting in stock split or it can go bankrupt immediately.  I explain Stock Split and Bankruptcy later.

Selling:
Players can not sell their shares based on the value indicated on the track.

Movement:
Refer to the chart
$$ indicate that player will gain dividend of $2,000 for each share they have.

STOCK SPLIT - WHAT IS THIS?
Double your existing shares - you move your stock to the second space on the  board.  Each stock card means you have 2 stock.  Then the value of the stock will go to the hexagonal space.

Reveal information - sell your shares

Very light, random, and swingy auction/stock game.  The main mechanism in the game is an auction in which you typically have very little idea of the value of what you're bidding on.  Sure, sometimes you have some insider info that's useful and can sort of bluff opponents, but more often you know a stock is going up or down by one or two, and you know nothing about most of the face up cards.  Your opponents may know something useful but if they do they're maybe bluffing you and more likely they have fairly useless info too.  So it feels like the game sort of plays you, at least I feel like I don't have much control of anything.  Could by a fun light family game but a little too long for that.

A neat stock market game in that players are bidding against each other for groups of stocks (stock piles) rather than paying market price for them like in most other stock games. So, you can very well buy stock at less than market value (or over market value if you're unfortunate.

I pretty much love any stock market game though otherwise, and this one has that neat distinction.

The only part of this game I don't like is convincing people to play. The stockmarket sounds inherently boring, and no amount of lovely cartoon artwork can shake that stigma.

RATING: 7
Shares some concepts with Biblios while managing to feel completely different, so that's pretty great.

I'm a sucker for auctions and I love the Cyclades-style bidding, but I was surprised to find it felt a little straightforward here. It's pretty rare for a lot to get SERIOUSLY competitive. It's fine because the rest of the game is really great - I had expected to just be more personally wowed by the auctions here. Instead it just felt like more of a minor point of the whole process.

I can quite easily see pulling this game out with just about anyone and having fun. The partial/hidden information makes for a lot of excitement. It's pretty swingy, but in a fun way instead of a frustrating one - the game is in trying to appropriately react to things ahead of time.

Quick note on the board - the art is lovely and the quality is pretty good... except that on the beginner side it doesn't lay quite flat. Not sure if this is just mine or a common issue, but it's a little sad to see. Still I suspect we won't be going back to the basic board so it's not really a big deal.

[b]Includes Stockpile: Continuing Corruption.[/b]

Rated 8 after one play. I like the idea of an approachable stock game, and I'd been searching for an option for the lunchtime gaming crew. We'd play Speculation a few times, but I suspected there was a better option.

This is clearly it. This is straight-up  better and a game that I think might quickly become one of our group's favorite go-to options. First off, the "amun-re" bidding mechanic is one I really enjoy in other games like Homesteaders and, uh, Amun-Re, and it fits like a glove in this game. The slight bit of hidden information creates a nice sense of brinksmanship between players, and the "advanced" side of the board should be a must unless people are really starting out new to gaming. It's great seeing the different companies behave differently.

Solid game and I look forward to more plays.

Update: Tried it with two players. I'll be darned! Much better than I expected. This might play well over the entire player count.

I tend to not rate games after only one play, but, oooof, this game was just not enjoyable, and I have no desire to ever re-visit it.  A too-large handful of randomness on top of an otherwise dull affair, resulting in a game that couldn't end soon enough for myself and several others of my fellow players.  The only redeeming feature was that it ended rather quickly and we could move on to better fare.

Preface: I love economic games. This one did not disappoint. It plays well with different numbers of players. The stock selection phase of the game has a bit of a coloretto feel, but with fun options for hidden information/bluffing. I like the unpredictability. I think the player powers over the market are substantial but not overwhelming in most cases. You can play a "smart" game and win a lot of the time, but there are still definitely luck influences in outcome.

RATING: 7.75
My first thoughts: I loved this game, the mechanics and art were great. The throw back to the 80s with the style completely fits and I am one of those people that will consider buying a game first on how it looks and then what it is. 

I played this twice in one sitting and the second time we all did a lot betrer with figuring out how to best go about the game. It was well balanced though since all of our scores ended up very close in the end so all of the different strategies were a good choice. 

I never thought I would ever consider buying a game about stocks since I just find the subject very bland but this ended up being a really fun game we all enjoyed. It's not the most complex game but it is a middle range one that let's anyone enjoy playing it. 

Overall, I would completely recommend this game to anyone that wants to try something a little different. The mechanics, in my opinion, benefit the theme of the game and it wouldn't be something you could just paste a new one on top of. Right now I have this rated at a 7.75 but that could increase as I play more and find better strategies.

Not really a stockmarket game, because players buying and selling shares doesn't influence the price.  Instead, it's more of a bidding/bluffing game in which you have some information about prices and some information about face-down cards, and you do what you can to maximise your profits.

There's too much randomness for me to really enjoy the game, but it's well done for what it is.

Stockpile is a great game, easily my favorite stock buying/selling game I have played.  I really enjoy the "insider information" mechanism, and the way you can incorporate bluffing in the gameplay.  Every game I have played has been a blast, and everyone has enjoyed it.  The alternate side for the board really makes the game interesting as you have to weigh the current value of the stock as well as its volatility.  The player powers also add another wrinkle to change up how each player approaches the game.  Great game!

I tend not to like stock market games. But I read some good reviews of this one, so I gave it a try. Were the reviewers right, or should I leave angry comments under their videos and demand to refund my investment? They were 100% correct. Amazing game, lots of fun and the stock market system is interesting, easy to grasp and you don’t need a calculator and an economics degree to play.

I still commend Stockpile in what it is trying to achieve, but ultimately, it's falling flat for me versus some other better economic/push-your-luck/bidding games such as For Sale and Jaipur. 


[August 2015 - 7.3]
I like Stockpile. It's a good game and one that can be played in a relative short amount of time. But ... is it like playing the real market, as some have said? Well ... not exactly. That's not a bad thing, necessarily. 

For starters, buying and selling stock in this game doesn't really affect the stocks. Rather the price movement happens randomly and the buying and selling is more of a reaction to those movements. While the stock price movement is random, it is limited to just six possible changes (up 1, up 2, up 4, pay dividend, down 2, down 3). There are as many change cards as there are stocks in the game so every round, you know half will go up, two will go down and one will pay a dividend. That adds a little strategy to the game (eg. "I know I have the +4, so no one else has it) but it also takes away a little excitement that there could be a big bull or bear market. Instead, every round, it's a more-or-less a balanced market. Maybe it all helps balance the game, but I'd rather see 20 or so change cards, creating the potential for rounds where all the stocks could rally or all could crash.

The buying/bidding for additional stock works well, and roughly translates into the more valuable a stock is, the higher the bids will be, but not always and it reminds me more of bidding for an estate (with a collection of stuff -- some known, some unseen in the back of a storage unit). Clever that the players get to put out the cards instead of it being random, but not sure that is very thematic.

Selling stock is my favorite part of the game and that for which closely resembles the real thing. Everyone has their own bit of insider information and you wonder "if they're selling, should I sell? Can I hold onto this stock one more round before it might crash?" Well done here!

Another reason to buy or hold onto stock is to be the majority shareholder, which ends up being some important points and key to pay attention what others declare during the dividend payout. Clever that you don't have to declare all your cards -- giving up some money for secrecy.

All in all, Stockpile works and it's fun with a decent balance of luck and strategy for a lightweight game.

Stockpile is an economic board game that combines the traditional stockholding strategy of buy low, sell high with several additional mechanisms to create a fast-paced, engaging and interactive experience.

In Stockpile, players act as stock market investors at the end of the 20th century hoping to strike it rich, and the investor with the most money at the end of the game is the winner. Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.

A decent but rather fluffy affair, with maybe too much randomness for my taste. I enjoyed playing and while perhaps it mimics the random nature of a stock market, the elements didn't really gel for me. I never got any satisfying sense of control and it seemed a bit like managed chaos.

One thing that might help it would be starting the game with more than a single stock. Until you gain multiples of anything you don't really have much direction and it seems like it takes at least two or three rounds before you have any kind of plan.

2017 Jan: It's a fairly easy-to-understand card game that really boils the stock market thing down to the idea of the stock market, with few bells and whistles. At first I loved it for that, but over time the game just didn't seem deep enough to warrant sustained plays (though, like Bohnanza, the group dynamics can make it more fun). The expansions promise more depth, but it just felt like too many extra mechanics strapped on (including the classic euro mechanical trope of set-collection for VP at 1=4, 2=9, 3=15, etc.).

Not a bad game at all, and I'll play it when people suggest it, but I'd never suggest it myself anymore.

2016 Sep: Quite fun stock-market-and-auction game that is easy to learn and play, with good player interaction. What drives the tension and fun of this game are the simple mechanics of the Information phase (each player gets foreknowledge of what will happen to one company this round) and the Supply phase (each player puts one card face-up and one card secretly face-down before the auction). Even more than Evolution, Stockpile is a card game that is marketed and priced as if it is a board game, which is unfortunate.

Nice riff on the buying/selling/investing genre.

I like that everyone will get a literal stockpile so you are guaranteed at least one card.  I'm also a fan that while you know 1/3 of the market movements, you are taking the risk on the ones you don't know.

Playing time is just right for this type of game.  A bit lighter, but not too light.

Stock market games often have the problem that they feel rather arbitrary in how the simulate the movement of the market. Those complex dynamics simply aren't a good fit for a stripped down board game. Still, evidence suggests that many designers believe otherwise. So how does Stockpile fare?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the movement of the market feels rather arbitrary. Heh. If you don't look at it from a stock market simulation perspective, however, it doesn't seem so bad. Players each get a bit of insider information that they can work with, stock packages are auctioned off each turn, and there is a bit of bluffing and trying to glean information from the actions of the other players going on about which stocks to keep and which stocks to sell. All in all, players do have quite a bit of influence on the proceedings even though the final results still rely heavily on good old dumb luck. Stockpile is a fairly fast-moving game with simple rules, and one of the better pure stock market games that I have seen in spite of a few shortcomings.

Best party game. Perfect game length & just enough luck & strategy. The insider information adds a great dimension to the game play, creating some suspicion & out-guessing. Scratches the same itch as Panic on Wall Street, but is more strategic- more 'thinky'. Both are different enough to co-exist in a game collection, though, since PoWS is more of a party game & a bit easier to teach. Great game!

I love how straightforward this game is. It's very easy to teach, it plays fast and is a lot of fun. I've disliked the only other stockmarket game I've tried, so I didn't have high hopes for this game, but I love it! The inside information makes every decision a psychological mind game and I like how it can allow you to play the odds. It's always exciting to see what face down cards you got in the auction and to see what happens to every stock.

Another game that I expected a bit more from. The bluffing and hidden information aspect was really cool. But I expected this to be a light hearted, fun, everyone laughing type of experience. But instead what I got was a table full of gamers who were playing probabilities in their heads, assessing odds as to which stocks would go up and which stocks would go down, and mathing everything out. They say your impression of a game is heavily framed by who you play your first games with and this is probably no different. I'd like to give this one another shot. I think there is more here than what I'm rating this. But for now, it's coming off my wish list.

Opinió després de una lectura de regles: joc econòmic de compra-venta d'accions.

Barreja de mecàniques conegudes (subasta per una pila de cartes, unes boca amunt i unes altres boca avall, variació de mercat amb informació parcial a cada jugador similar al Hab & Gut, etc...)

Sencill i poc profund, la subasta a cegues sempre afegeix molt caos. No interesa, no crec ni que el provés...

Played at Salt Con.  Surprisingly fun game.  Didn't expect much from the garish colors but the game play was quite satisfying.  I love building piles and I like that style of auction.  There was a bit too much fiddlyness but it went quickly enough.  I would probably rate this higher but I don't expect to ever play again, meaning I would eventually come back and drop the rating down to a 6 anyway.

Played back to back games. The advanced side of the board is not any harder, it just requires you to pay more attention to the distance between it's current location and bankruptcy/split. The bidding was more intense on the advanced side, so I don't think I would play with the basic side again.

Next time I need to add in Investor cards.

Print and play version. Very fun, engaging little game. Mechanics all work cleanly together, easy to teach and pick up, plays fast. I could see this one being very popular in mixed groups of gamers and newbies. Looks math-y, but isn't. Will probably pick up a retail copy.

This game is pretty solid but it is a little lacking without the Counting Corruption expansion. I dislike that the base game only has the 6 market cards that will tell you how the market will move that turn. It would be a couple points higher if the expansion was part of the base game.

I got to play a prototype with the designer at Gameholecon in Madison, WI and I had a blast. I was originally turned off by the theme and thought it would be too dry, AP heavy, and number-crunchy for me, but I was proved completely wrong. Stock holding, auctions, set collection, press-your-luck, and bluffing all come together in a simple and elegant way. There were lots of tough choices to be made. There is some luck, but it works with the theme and is in my opinion what gives the game it's tension.

RATING: 7
This one hasn't quite hit the sweet spot of short to medium length stock trading games (none have yet that i'm aware of).

While there is 1 piece of stock information visible each round, and you try to guess what other plays information cards say by their actions in the bidding phase and selling phase, it still comes down to a guess.

I can't help thinking that unless another player(s) makes it blatantly obvious what they are doing (which share that they know is going up/down), then you should just play the odds and ignore everyone else.

I enjoyed my first play, and given that it's a 45min game, it can be excused some faults, but it remains to be seen whether this will stand up to more plays.

Initial Rating: 6.0 (April 2016)

Stockpile was one of the boardgames I bought completely blind. I only bought it to achieve free shipping some months ago, however, some friends said the game received good reviews so we decided to play it.

The rules are very easy to teach. You can do it under 10 minutes. Playtime is around 45 minutes, it plays very fast. The game components are very well done (high production values).

Stockpile is a light-medium weight stock game. The decisions needed in the game aren’t obvious, but they aren’t hard either. It is always fun to take decisions with incomplete information (The Boss), so you have to take risks and carefully analyze your opponents moves as they know something you don’t (I LOVE this feature, by far the best of the game).

Luck can be (somewhat) mitigated, but sometimes it can really harm/help you without any input from your part. 

Bottom line, Stockpile is a harmless game. I had fun playing it and I still need to try the advanced variants but I’m undecided if I should keep it or not (I will play it again before deciding). It is, without a doubt, the best stock market I have ever played. It is a good family game. 

Current Rating: 6.0

RATING: 10
This is a great game that has a pre-defined length.  There is a good mixture of strategy and luck in this game, combined with playing against other players to learn their secret information.

This game is for people that like to pay attention.  There is not a lot of room for AP other than in the stock bidding phase, which there is only 5 rounds.

The game seems random, but given you know 2 of 5 cards that define which stocks go up or down, you can figure the rest out in the bidding and selling phases, and there are only 5 stock movement cards in total, so you know your 3/5 odds of overall the stocks you buy going up or down based on which 3 cards you don't know.

STRONGLY RECOMMEND playing with the reverse-side board as it as much more variability and strategy than the default side.  Even for newbies.

Super light, fun stock manipulation game. This is a family-friendly, casual game, so keep that in mind. It could be a non-threatening intro to auction games. Simple, crafty mechanisms give you the feeling of having insider information. And you do, but so does everyone else... Turn order is important. Better to go last so you can let other player's actions influence your own choices.

A big plus for me in this game is that stocks really do move up and down and there are real risks to take into consideration as your stock could wind up in the trash or splitting in short order. Many stock games have a hard time getting interesting, risky stock movement going, but this one gets it right (for what it needs to be for the game).

Stockpile is Amun-Re at Wall Street. Each round, as many lots of shares and events are auctioned parallely as there are players. The principle is the same as in Amun-Re with the exception that it is possible to raise the bid on the same item.
 
The system informed by these auctions is a different kind of beast. Players have limited insight into the changes of stock prices and speculate on the development of the prices of six shares. Each turn after the auction and the price adjustments due to events but before the “regular” price changes, stocks can be sold. At game end, all shares in the hands of players are valued with the final stock price, bonuses for the largest shareholders are paid out and cash on hand is added.

Compared to Amun-Re or the comparable Vegas Showdown, Stockpile is shorter and more random. Skill is involved but luck can thwart the best plan. Getting dealt the crucial high value price change information more often and a lucky distribution of the price changes matching the own stock portfolio are distinctive advantages. Nonetheless, it’s one of the rare stock market games that works as a game and is fun to play for experienced gamers.

I've played it three times now and I've liked it less after every play. I thought it was great after my first play; I was ready to run out and buy it. We played it again on the "advanced" side; after that play I wasn't so sure about it. Played a third game on the standard side of the board, decided it was pure random, chaotic, silliness. A game like that is fun every once in a while but it's not something I'd like to play regularly.

It's a quick filler. I don't think I'd ever request to play it again but it's harmless enough that I wouldn't say no to a game. (I do love the old school fake company names. It makes it seem that the game was first published in the 1970s.)

I don't know what it is about this game. I find the turn by turn moments so much fun it doesn't even matter if I'm losing. And it's easy to teach. And it's a quick game; at any player count it zings along. Such a slick and pleasant design.

I think the secret might be: just enough randomness to keep it light but just enough control to stay constantly engaged and just enough secret info to keep it from getting bogged down in calculations.

Bought this on a whim as I was trying to find a stock/economic game I could play with the family. My son wasn't at all familiar with the ins and outs of the stockmarket and usually these types of games are not ones my wife enjoys. Let me say we had a blast playing this game. We played the "starter" version of the game without the investors and the game was not only enjoyable put quick as well. Only downside is I wish there were other ways to get/buy stock, other than that really not a bad thing to say and a real sleeper game for us that my family is looking forward to playing again.

a little hard to decide where to put your cards during supply, but it also doesn't seem like it matters as much as it feels like it matters, the bidding is what ultimately matters the most-the only thing to avoid is making a pile you want too good if you don't have the $ to pay for it, wouldn't play this without the expansion

If my family wanted to play, I wouldn't say no. I've only played with 3 and thought it worked well with that amount. It's light, it's stocks, it's random. I liked the bluffing aspect of what cards to bid on. Always enjoyed the mechanic in auction games of raising bids just for the sake of making the other player pay more. However not a big fan of bidding on things you don't know what they are. Nothing felt crushing in this game when stocks crashed. Wondering if it plays better with five. I enjoy heavier economic games by far but yet again I wouldn't cringe if someone brought this to the table.

Lightweight stock manipulating game which is okay, but there is nothing spectacular fantastic or exciting. The biggest issue (for me) is, that in every round there is value change for every company and in every round you use same set of value change cards. Which company gets which value change is the question here? - but that question isn't interesting enough. Sure I'm ready to play it, but for sure I'll choose 'Speculation', 'Black Friday', '1920 Wall Street' or 'Mogul' before this one.

Stockpile is an economic board game that combines the traditional stockholding strategy of buy low, sell high with several additional mechanisms to create a fast-paced, engaging and interactive experience.

In Stockpile, players act as stock market investors at the end of the 20th century hoping to strike it rich, and the investor with the most money at the end of the game is the winner. Stockpile centers on the idea that nobody knows everything about the stock market, but everyone does know something. In the game, this philosophy manifests in two ways: insider information and the stockpile.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS:

Enjoyable stock market game that is more on the casual/quick side (think more on the side of Spekulation and less on the serious side). Play the advanced board out of the box - that base board is too boring. I do wish there was a bit more variation or some other way to manipulate the stock price than what exists. I'm not certain about the special powers either of each character.

굉장히 간단한 주식게임... 단순한...

군더더기는 없지만 단순한 만큼 전략적이지 못하고 
흘러가는데로 흘러가게 된다. 

마지막 major 때문에 굳이 경매비용을 위한 판매와 
파산을 제외하곤 판매의 필요성이 낮고 파산도 쉽지 않고 
대비가 많이 되다 보니 의외로 긴장이 떨어진다.

A pretty solid stock game where you have some information about the market, some information about stocks that are coming out, and can bid using the same fixed auction mechanic you see in Vegas Showdown, Amun Re and Homesteaders.  

Overall this is a very good game.  The base game was ok, but there are other variants which make it more fun.  I liked the game overall.

Well made stock game with hidden information. The bidding uses Amun Re/ Homesteaders style auction, however it is lighter here as every player is bound to get something from the stockpile.
Turn order is very important in this game, as each player only has a very limited view of the overall trend (1 public, 1 only you can see, out of a total of 6) so that selling after other players (who may have insider information that you don't) a very vital move. With a 4 player game (6 rounds), 2 players would be the first player more than the other 2, which may have significant impact on the overall game result.
Overall for the 3 stock games that I have played:
Acquire --> Less luck, but more abstract, a classic
Hab & Gut --> recently got a reprint from Taiwan, a hidden gem, best balance between luck and tactic
Stockpile --> lightest among all 3 with an interesting mechanic, however gameplay is a bit too long considering its randomness. However this game is an excellent substitute for Monopoly esp for non boardgamers as the mechanisms are easy to understand.

This doesn't strike me as a game I'd normally give a 10 to. But this game is pure fun with easy mechanics, great decisions, nice aesthetics, from a first time designer on Kickstarter. I cannot find anything at all to complain about... NOTHING. Maybe that the round marker is cheap, but then I'd just be a douche trying to nitpick. Even the theme they took something rather uninteresting and turned it into a blast to play!! 10 all the way around!!

Excellent financial market simulator which can be tackled by everyone.

A huge hit with my girlfriend and her family.

Never bother to play with the standard board, and do yourself a favor and play with the dice included in the expansion. They're a must.

(3/17) 7. A really cool, interesting take on stock market games.  Some open information for everyone to share, some secret information that each player has, with plenty of opportunities to try to infer what others know based on the actions they've taken.  Can't wait to play it again.

RATING: 6
This is a game I should be celebrating, especially with my interest in the stock market.  By the end of the game, I didn't have an urge to retry or master this game.

Strip Stockpile away from all the fancy artwork and you'll end up with an auction game that feels like this an awkward Storage Wars spin-off, but you're dealing with shares of major companies, not random junk.

The idea behind Stockpile is players will have some hidden information about a certain company's price movement at the end of the round.  There is also one company with its price movement shown to everyone.

With this information present, players place cards into "lots" to bid on later.  Each player draws two cards and puts those two into the lots: One face down, one face up.  Once everyone has done this, the auction begins.

This is a major problem with me: You are bidding on lots of cards based on very little information.  You only know the price movements of two companies, one of them being public to everybody.  The lots themselves might have hidden cards, thus you have no idea if you are going to be hit with a "trader fee" which means you lose more money just by purchasing the lot.

Sure, it introduces "meta" strategies like bluffing, but this feels like gambling instead of investing or bidding.  I prefer auction games where the value of item(s) in question is understandable.

For half the price and within the same playtime, Reiner Knizia's "Modern Art" does a far better job at being a highly interactive auction game with elements of bluffing and passive-aggressive behavior without the hidden nonsense.

I'm baffled as to why so many people like/love this game. Here are my problems with it: 

1. Takes too long for what it is (If you have the slightest bit of AP, or your partner(s) do, Stockpile can easily take 90-120 minutes depending on player count. It needs to stay under an hour, for sure. 
2. Does not scale well for 2 players. Despite Rahdo's stamp of approval, this game does not play well with 2. It's not awful, but it needs more players/interaction to really make it interesting. 
3. Most importantly, Stockpile pretends to be a strategy game. In reality, it's one of those games that frustrate the hell out of you because the swings are HUGE and there's just such a high element of randomness. You can say that fits the theme, and I don't disagree, but it's either a strategy game or a party game. This game is ostensibly a strategy game, but turns out to be a party game in the end. It's just too long and bland for that. 

Definitely try before you buy!

Marvellously combined randomness and strategy by inducing insider information.
One thing I'm not happy with is demand phase as it is an auction game. I don't much like the feeling that I'm buying stocks that I don't know (trading fee cards are good fun though). I thought it would be better to buy stocks at the current price / or each stock's price should be determined by the law of supply and demand among players. 
and maybe trading among players would be great.

Solid, well put together game with original and interesting stock control acquisition and movement mechanisms. What has me find this game only okay, however, is the amount of luck involved in what cards you get versus how the stocks move. Sometimes, there's just nothing you can do, particularly if the inside information you are given happens to be totally irrelevant that round, while sometimes a huge fortune falls into your lap.

The swings in fortune that randomly occur are a bit much for me. A company can go +4 or -3 without you being able to deduce it before you are impacted. If you incur a loss early it can cost you the game as you won't have enough money for the next auction and it becomes a case of the rich gets richer. I find this a shame because the auction mechanic, with players having different knowledge of stack compositions, is brilliant.I just wish there was more ability to deduce upcoming changes in stock price.

The sensation I get when playing is similar to that of Las Vegas but I feel like I am making more meaningful decisions in that game.

I'm not really one much for stock market games. The theme doesn't really appeal and the mechanics of games I've tried have been at best 'okay'. Stockpile has changed that a little in that I was quite surprised to find myself enjoying this, mainly due to the possibilities offered by the application of asymmetrical knowledge to influence the game and attempt to get the most cash as share value fluctuates wildly.

The initial game explanation was a little lengthy but once all players were across how it all worked the game played very well. 

I would be unlikely to buy this game but could see myself playing again.

So very close to being an amazing game, but as is often the case with stock market games, the element of fun doesn't seem to be present. The game works really well, however, and the rules are very easy to pick up. I just didn't get much enjoyment out of the game despite how well-designed it is. I think part of that is that there's really no way to take big risks for big rewards. You just play the odds, and sometimes they pan out, sometimes they don't. Kind of gives me a similar feel to Lords of Vegas, but here everyone has a little hidden information on what brands pay out. Not a great game for me, but a surprisingly solid one.

My family has a tough time getting into games and playing a single game for more than 30 minutes. We played for about an hour and throughout the game they continued to say that they enjoyed the game. I'm so glad I backed it and I know it will get to the table a lot.

There are 6 stocks available set at a price of $5.  Each player is seeded secretly with one share.with one share. In each turn, there are 6 things that can happen to the stock: up +4, +1, down -2, -3, or dividend, and these are known as forecast cards. Each player sees a company card and forecast card. One pair is faceup, while the rest are facedown. Players then draw two stock cards, and put one face up, one face down into a bid pile, where players bid for the piles, using the bidding mechanism in Amun Re. With some known information, this is where the tagline "insider trading" comes in. Shares can split when they reach $10, and players lose shares when they hit $0. At the end of each round, players have the option to sell shares. At the end of the game, the majority owner of a company gets $10 in addition to the worth of the stock. In the advanced game, each player gets an investor that gives them special effects. 

Consider the case where one player's starting share goes up +4 or always gets the dividend of $2 per share. It can easily happen and create  a game that is not very fun. Simply said, some shares can repeatedly get lucky or unlucky to the point of randomness. If there was someway to manage the big swings the game might be more playable, but it is okay at best, as there is a lot of luck, and the game does introduce any new mechanics. On the plus side, it might be a good family game, as it as easy to learn and plays quickly.

This game is amazing.  It is among my favorites to play and also to watch.  Anyone who thinks a stock/investment theme is boring or too much like work will be pleasantly surprised.  This game is simple, fast, elegant in its gameplay.  There is the right amount of randomness via the company and performance cards, and the stock cards.  The variety of mechanisms simply comes together perfectly.  It plays reliably time-wise at around an hour.  There is a good level of tension throughout.  There is also some fun emergent gameplay as players come up with and build upon stories as to why the companies are performing as they are.  This is a must for any board game collection.

Enjoyed. A good, very simple and easy to understand stock market simulation. Just six stocks to buy, and the same number of events that might happen to any of them each round (price up/down by different amounts or pay dividends). The bidding on piles of stocks + action cards + penalties makes the game stand out above other stock games (even though it may not quite fit the theme, realistically). Stock behaviours are totally random, and having your stock get wiped out is painful, but it's a light game and should be played as such. I did find it slightly odd that buying/selling stocks doesn't affect market prices (as it does in other games) - market manipulation is reduced to simple action cards (boom/bust).

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year and a half later... thoughts and rating (8 -> [b]8[/b]/10)[/COLOR]

[i]I finally got to play Stockpile again, this time my kids and they loved it.  I immediately ordered both Stockpile and the Continuing Corruption expansion based on their enjoyment of the game. Stockpile is by far the best family weight stock game I've played; it's much easier to teach than Airlines Europe and more fun and interactive. My two older kids absolutely love it, we'll be playing this on family game nights for a long time to come. If I was making a list of essential family games, Stockpile would make the list.[/i] 

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]Stockpile is another game that I feel I need to play a few more times to form a solid opinion. Off the cuff I think it is the perfect stock manipulation gateway game. The rules for the game are definitely straight forward enough t make this a great family game I'd be more inclined to pick it up if I didn't already have a back log of games to teach my family and I think more is definitely better with this type of game. 

There is plenty going on in Stockpile to break this out with your game group, I think it would make a great super filler since it takes 45-60 minutes. My favorite mechanic in the game is playing cards to the piles you will eventually bid on. One card goes face up while the second card goes face down, this encourages bluffing and lots of potential to really mess with your opponents as they try to figure out what your plan is. 

Stockpile is a game I'm really looking forward to playing again, which I hope is soon.[/i]

Solid game that is marred a tad by a bit too much game maintenance.  You have to recover, reshuffle, and redeal the company and movements cards (which takes even longer with the corruption expansion), deal out two stockpile cards, adjust the stock price tracks, as well as pause at several points to allow players to use their special ability.  This is the reason I would choose not to use the special powers.   The "place one card face up and one card face down" mechanic can be undone if players generally keep the piles even.  But if the piles are obviously not equal, the bidding can get quite tense.  Hence the game shines when players focus on screwage.

Stockpile is a stock speculation game that features an Amun-Re style multiple-lot auction, which is one of my favorite game mechanics.  Players create the auction lots, made of stocks and events that influence share prices, placing some of the cards face-up and others face-down.  Players are all given one piece of "insider information" each round, so they know something about one stock.  After acquiring a lot of stocks, players must decide whether to hold the stocks, or sell at the current share price.  At the end of the game, shares pay out their share price as well as a majority bonus for each stock.  I thought that the decisions in the basic game were a little bit too easy, as you know the stocks will go up on average, and there are lots of bonuses for just having stocks (dividends, majority bonuses). A quick look at the advanced game makes me think that will address that concern, though, as it provides some asymmetry that looks really fun. Overall, the gameplay was very smooth, and you had some good decision points every turn.

This game is a pile of awesomeness! Just about the right amount of luck and strategy for a light to medium stock market game. The best implementation of stock trading simulation for a game in this playime range. And it´s not a dry calculating exercise at all (although I like those kind of games too). This game is instead a fun speculating and bluffing game full of emotions.

Fun auction/stock game, played quickly, and was interactive for stacking the stock piles or when to sell off.  It excelled at being a gateway/medium game and not dry unlike others of this type.

The stock piles as well as the hidden stock performance information can get swingy and lucky, especially based on turn order, thus might irk players.

Not for players who don't like luck, chaos, or randomness factors.
As a 2-player game, not to be taken seriously it is OK for entertainment.
But gets progressively more chaotic as the number of players increases.
The expansions just add more luck and chaos, instead of reducing them.

This is a game where it is only possible to win by having a strategy, but where strategy is constantly weakened by partial information, deception and luck.

It's a fun game that elicits much excitement, it has a very low barrier to entry and - despite the main mechanic being bidding against each other - it rarely let losers a reason for being sore.

In my club we normally play it as "chill out" session after a round of some heavier game.

Solid playing-the-market game with some fun 'insider' information. The latter is where my niggle lies... if you get that +4 (and, similarly, the -3) is a couple of times, it can really take the game away from the other players without their skill being a factor. Good fun, overall, and very much enjoyed by a 6 year old, too. Expansion recommended.

This is a medium to light game about buying and selling stocks. If you play this, do yourself a favor, and play with every extra feature, and the reverse side of the board where the stocks preform differently. The expansion elements also really help to amp up the fun of this game. The idea is that players bid on lots of stocks they seed themselves, by playing one card face up and one card face down. All players get to see the performance of one stock, and each player gets to secretly know what another stock will do in the next adjustment phase. By paying attention to players, you can guess what the best move is. The variable player powers are silly and thematic.

Really wanted to like this, but if you don't play with competitive enough players (or you play w/ risk-averse people), the mechanics become very predictable.

If you play with more competitive  people, I hear the game is better. But I have to judge a game whose rules don't seem to encourage this kind of play when it is essential for the game to be fun.

Basically, when you're setting up the stock piles, if your group tends to try and make them similar sizes, the game will suck.

RATING: 8
A great auction game with lots of small hidden-information mechanics that add up nicely. I always feel like I know enough about what is going on to make pretty good decisions, but not enough to make the best possible ones. I like trying to balance doing the best move with not giving away valuable information to the other players, or trying to bluff them into making bad plays. I also really like how expandable it is right out of the box, with a "basic" board and an "advanced" board, and optional unique player powers. The basic game is at a good level for teaching new players, but the advanced game makes things much more interesting once everyone has the hang of it.

Unfortunately, the amount of luck in the market cards (how much companies' stock goes up and down) can be too strong of a deciding factor sometimes. If you get a lot of a particular stock early on and then it keeps going way up every round, that can give you a large advantage. That said, there are lots of ways to mitigate the cards you have been dealt and I don't think it's a huge problem.

After two plays I find that this game plays me more than I play it.  I know that there is luck in the stock market,  but I did not feel that I had much control in the game.  Some players invested in stocks only to find them go bankrupt in one, or two turns while others had stocks skyrocket.  There was little control over avoiding disaster and  much luck in hitting it big.  Just hope that you get lucky and pick the right stocks.

Seth Van Orden brought a copy to demo at the local FLGS.

There were 5 of us and we played STOCKPILE 2 times (both complete games). The first play was using the standard board. The game easy to learn and play. I enjoyed the insider information aspect of being the only one to know what one of stocks was going to do (either increase or decrease in price at the end of the round).

The second play was using the advanced board and the investor cards. The advanced board and it changes to stock prices made them more interesting and volatile. The risk was greater if you were holding certain stocks( if a company went bankrupt all players discarded their stocks in that company). 

The investor cards add a fun dynamitic to the game. Each investor has a action he or she can do once during the round. For example my investor had the ability to look at all the facedown cards in a single row. Which could be very useful in deciding what row to buy. During one round I used my action to drive up the cost in two other rows by not placing my pawn to buy the stocks in the row I used my action on. I then ended up getting that row for no cost because the other four players avoided it. I would like to think that's how it played out but the fun is who knows for sure.

All in all I found the game to be a very enjoyable play and I am glad Seth brought in to demo.  I plan on backing the game on Kickstarter.

It is time to predict the stock market and invest and divest more profitably than your opponents. But the twist is everyone knows what one stock will do each turn, along with you and each opponent knowing what yet one other stock will do at the end of the round.  And nobody knows what the other stocks will do, but they are sure to do something.  So use a little industry common knowledge, some insider trading information, and some frugality to buy and sell shares, to watch shares split or bankrupt, and to build the largest profit from your original $20K.  Buy low sell high is a bit ineffective here, because this market is short term and more volatile than a standard market.

After a couple of plays I was loving this game, but after several plays I have come to find it to be only a solid game. It gives you the real feel of the stock market. You are trying to make good decisions in the midst of the unknown ups and downs of the stocks. I really enjoy the game but there are definitely others I would prefer to play over this one most of the time. I usually bring this one out when me and my wife are playing with another couple and I know one of them is either not into boardgames or likes lighter games. I always enjoy playing it though and am glad it is in my collection. It will be a great game when the kids get a bit older. **Wife:8

After first game (3 players) I was very disappointed by the game. It just felt flat.

Luckily I decided to bring it for a family weekend and it was a hit. I still don't love the game, but it has definitely grown on me. The turn order is probably a bit too important for my liking, as it heavily punishes whoever goes first.

The luck factor is also somewhat higher than what I usually like. Still a great family game though

We received Stockpile and Continuing Corruption in the mail as KS backers.  My wife and I had never played the game before so we began using the basic game.  It was fun.  After the first round it became very clear how to play.  Easy rules and it's pretty easy to get a strategy going.  There is a bit of hidden information to prevent AP, but enough information to build a decent strategy.

After we finished we read the rules for the "advanced side of the board" and what the other expansions provided.  After having played with all the expansions there isn't any reason to go back to the base game. The expansions don't add complexity, just options.

Certainly one of the better pure-stock games (better than Black Friday).

Very simple and fairly quick stock-manipulation game, in which you buy and sell shares and try to manipulate the share prices of the various companies. Sounds like pretty standard stuff - but this game introduces a few mechanics which, while hardly complicated (you can teach this game in about 10 minutes) or revolutionary, can make it into quite a brutal affair and lead to lots of very interesting decisions. There are really two key mechanics, one of which is the fact that each player is dealt some secret information about how the share values will move at the end of the round. The other is that the players bid on various piles of cards (mostly containing shares, but also some other cards which can manipulate stock values, or cause the pile to cost more than the bid value), which are created by the players, who each must contribute one face-up card and one face-down card - in whichever arrangement they choose. These two mechanics, individually and in combination, create many opportunities for bluffing and misdirection - as well as for deduction (from the way the hidden information is given out, you can often deduce something about whether a company's share value will go up or down). I have only played a handful of times to date (with a friend's copy, it's a game which I had marked down as of interest to me, and which I'd still like to own, but which clearly I don't need to now one of our group has it), but have really enjoyed all of those plays and look forward to subsequent ones. This reminds me of a lot of those older Euros where the rules are very simple but create a lot of opportunity for rich player interaction, much of it in the players' heads - and strikes me as a particularly fine example.

Stockpile is a fairly light and enjoyable stock market game where players are  trying to buy and sell stocks for the most profit.  each player bids on  portfolios full of stocks and try to anticipate where the  stock prices will go.

Pros: unique market mechanic with partial information. Fairly fast gameplay, quality board and components. Enjoyable theme and graphic presentation. Light hearted game. 

Cons: no really deep decisions... mostly luck based with a little skill in anticipating the market.

This game surprised me. I expected a good game and got a great one. The tactics in this game cater to both mechanical/strategy players and social deduction players. There are multiple ways to go about this game with the end goal being to get the most money.

The advanced board definitely brings the game to a whole new level and I would recommend playing on that one, but play the standard for your first game.

The investor cards are not equally balanced so I would recommend the "Bid on Investors" variant described in the expansion rules.

At the end of the day this game lets you do your thing and score points, with a little player interaction and social deduction added in for fun. A great "board game" with a decent theme. Fun to play and would recommend.

A clever and elegant auction/stock game. Quick and simple enough to be a filler, especially at lower player counts. Luck is a factor, but given the quick play time there is a good balance between luck and strategy. Throughout the game players stay engaged and on their toes (not much downtime). 

As soon as you are comfortable with the basic game (after 1-2 plays) definitely start adding the investors and play with the advanced side of the board. These add a lot more interest to the game. 

Highly recommended.

Rare to find an economic/financial game with little downtime between players. Granted, this is a lightweight version from this genre but this incorporates some simple mechanics which creates solid player interaction. With a combination of open and insider knowledge, players create and bid on piles of stocks (i.e. "Stockpile"). Some cards are face-up; others are face-down. The quote, "A little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing" really applies because you are speculating if the other secret players' stock cards may cause a specific stock you are holding to go up or down. First time out of the box it looked a little daunting but don't be fooled...this is a light and easy to teach financial game with solid player interaction, check this one out.

I've played stockpile 5 times now and it truly shines with 5 players with the investors. 
The strengths of the game are the quicker play time, the accessibility of the rules and  mechanics, and the deduction attached to the hidden information in the stock changes and bids.

I feel the weaknesses of the game lie in randomness of the stock changes. What seems like a good investment early on can turn into garbage from a streak of bad luck. This can sometimes make it very difficult to recover from an early poor investment as there is really no comeback mechanic. However, by diversifying the stocks you buy you can avoid being devastated by a streak of bad luck.

This minor weakness can be forgiven due to the shorter play time and low player downtime making a horrible loss due to a streak of bad luck less painful than in a game that lasts 2-3 hours with lots of downtime between turns. 

Stockpile is quite enjoyable and the hidden information leaves you suspicious of every action your opponents take. Good choices in investments can be rewarded, and good placement on the bidding phase can net you massive value. The investors add diversity to the game by offering effects that change the way you play, making multiple playthroughs far more enjoyable.

I don't think I can give this a full rating yet, so this is provisional. The base game is pretty vanilla and it seems that the luck of what you get and how the stocks move is pretty significant. While the same perhaps can be said of the advanced game, the fact that you have more stocks and they move differently would make for more interesting choices for which stocks to pursue and when to buy and sell them. I'd love to play the advanced game and see how it goes.

Players acquire shares by bidding with partial information on sets of cards, some face up and some face down, some shares, some costing money and some enabling market manipulations. Most stock movement is randomly driven, however, and players again have partial knowledge -- each has inside information about a different company.

Players have too little control over market movements for it to be interesting in the same way as incentive-management stock games, but it's a clever super-filler. The advanced rules, where each player has a unique power and each company has a different risk/reward profile, are a huge improvement over the basic game.

odd stock market game
dry theme (stock market)
asymmetric player powers
expensive and hard to attain (Kickstarter)

It's odd because you don't buy shares in this game, you basically draft a pile with a little bit of bidding. It's very limited what amount you can get and how prices for buying are formed. Oftentimes you can't raise prices for more than one pile, if you think the biddings are too low, because you can only bid for one pile and you don't get another bid if nobody overbids you.

The game is too short. It really should be played so that every player has been starting player an equal amount of times, everything else is unfair/unbalanced. And it would need more turns to have a long term strategy pay off. So, I'd say everybody should be starting player at least twice.

After one play, I like the way this game emphasizes the gambling aspect of investing. The insider information provides just enough information that you think you have a leg up on the competition, but you really don't. This plays like a thinking man's game while it's best suited for a fun, party-like atmosphere. I like it.

I've heard a lot of praise for [thing=161614][/thing], and I can see why a lot of people like it.  It combines fairly simple stock trading with some interesting mechanics.  The main draw is that each round, each player gets a different piece of insider information.  Then there is a bidding round that combines public and hidden knowledge.

I enjoyed the hidden knowledge and bluffing aspect a lot.  However, the hidden information kind of vanished during the sell phase because once one person started to sell stock (presumably because they knew it was going to go down in value), everyone else could just sell as well and take advantage of it.  It seems like the decisions to sell should all be made secretly and simultaneously.  It's also very possible that we played the rules wrong and my complaint is just due to someone teaching the game wrong.  I hope that is the case, because with the hidden information aspect diminished, the rest of the game isn't special enough to make me want to play it again.

Not a bad system, but a little too light for taste (and I usually like lighter games). One or two players can luck into some high value split stocks and gain a huge lead, making the endgame anticlimactic.

Initial games of this I played were met with glowing reviews from the other players.

It hits on a lot of the right notes, it's exceedingly accessible and yet has a lot of room for decision making and reading the table.

There's the right amount of luck pushing and tension and the playtime is pretty much perfect for this type of game.

We haven't even broken out the investors yet either and I am excited to add them in and eventually the bonds and commodities from the expansion too.

Only knock I have is the player boards seem to bow worse than any cardboard I've seen.

I need to get some more plays of Stockpile. The bankrupt/stock split mechanic is really cool, and the bit of hidden information is a fun way to try to get the inside track on the next big thing.

Stockpile is a very quick filler-ish stock market game.  Every round the stock for all the companies will be adjusted via forecast cards.  Every player gets to see in advance what will happen to a particular stock via a private forecast and all players see what will happen to another stock via a public forecast.  Then cards equal to the number of players will be revealed for auction.  Additionally players will be given two cards which they must assign to an auction pile, one face up and one face down.  Then there is an auction (there are set bids you must make on the game board).  There's an opportunity to sell stock.  And finally all the forecasts are executed.  Rinse and repeat for six or so rounds.  At the end of the game there's bonuses for having the majority of stock in companies and then you sell off your shares.  Most money wins.

There's nothing revolutionary here, but it's quick and fun enough.

RATING: 6.5
Have only played once, but for this type of game I think that's plenty to share my thoughts.  It's not exactly a deep game, you're not going to be experimenting with different paths to victory, the enjoyment is "gaming" the other players.

Stockpile reminded me a lot of Biblios.  There's a mix of hidden and public information, but you're not playing towards one late game scoring, rather you're constantly pushing your luck deciding when to offload your stocks, when to cash them in, when to hold onto them for end game points.  It's more dynamic in that sense. I will say also that the theme of playing the Stock Market is much more appropriate than stodgy Monks working a library.  With the transient nature of the stocks you do lose a bit of ownership, the stock you're rushing to get the first few turns might be something you couldn't care less about after dumping it.  I suppose that's realistic to the stock market, but I miss that feeling a bit of rooting for your "team" that you get in another stock game, Airlines: Europe.  There is a competitive auction each turn of hidden and visible information seeded by players, the auction is the same as found in Cyclades a few people distaste the stress of constantly being outbid, but it's generally an enjoyed system.  There is a bit of a rich get richer element here however where a few overbids on poor stocks and you might just get muscled out of good auctions.  There's a bit of a mitigating mechanism where you can flip stocks to purchase back later at a higher price, but could lessen some people's enjoyment.

Overall I think Stock Market succeeds at building upon the Gameplay of Biblios, elevating it slightly into less of a filler and closer to a game.  It's one that's swingy on luck, but a fun time.

The basic gist of Stockpile is that there are six companies and each turn three will have their shares go up in value, two will go down and one will pay a small dividend. In between the price changes, players purchase shares in auction lots and some get to do a little bit of market manipulation and then everyone can sell any shares they wish. When the game ends, the player that became the richest, wins.

That of course, leaves out the most important twist to the whole game. Before each turn, the players are dealt information about what exactly one of the six stocks will do. Insider trading info, if you will. There is also one publically revealed forecast, but all other info is hidden, leaving the player's to try and deduce what the other players know so as not to get caught with bankrupted holdings. It really ratchets up the fun a few notches in what would otherwise be a pretty dry game.

The game also comes with parodies character roles of some famous "money men" (and women), giving the game some asymmetry. I don't know how well balanced they are, but they are hilariously spot on with their abilities.

It was way more fun than I expected and as a nice bonus, very quick to teach and play.

This game got a lot of dirty looks at my weekly meetup. I started to set it up to drum up interest and no one came over to even take a look. I guess the words “stock game” are anathema to fun. I decided to try it out with my in-laws since I had heard the game was a light-weight hour long affair and the goal of acquiring the most money is pretty easy to get behind. Well, an hour later, my wife had the most dough and everyone else around the table had a good time.

As I said before, your job is to acquire the most money. You’ll do this through acquiring and selling stocks while having a little bit of insider information about what the stocks are going to do this round: they may go up or down, or pay out dividends. If a stock goes up high enough, it splits, doubling the number of stocks you own. If a stock goes low enough, it goes bankrupt and the stock is now worthless.

In order to acquire the stocks, you’ll be bidding on “stockpiles” which are piles of three cards of stocks, action cards to raise and lower the value of certain stocks, and trading fees which just take more of your money. These stockpiles are empty at first and you deal one card face up to each and then the rest of the players are dealt two cards each and play one card face up and one card face down to any of the piles, possibly the same pile and possibly not.

There’s a lot to like here: easy rules, quick playing time, real world theme and goal. This is the Ticket to Ride of stock games and would be what I’d introduce to someone who said they like Monopoly and were trying to get into hobby board games.

Light, fast paced, stock trading game. Where this game shines is in the player interaction and bidding mechanic during the stock acquisition phase. Quick assessments of stock pile values based on public and private information compounded with player disinformation captures the human turbulence in the financial markets. Looking forwad to trying the advanced board that introduces investor tolerance for risk/reward.

RATING: 8
Our first play with five players went quite well. Lots of fun decisions with the bidding, trying to fake out other players... or outright push them away from stuff you (might) want. Having the insider information is a fun wrinkle, and knowing when to sell your stuff as the game goes on becomes quite important.

There's some randomness in the game, to be sure, but I felt you had enough leverage on the cards you played and the insider info to balance your strategy. If you live dangerously with a low-value stock, it could bust.

I liked the flow of the game, for the most part, and the theming and components are solid. A touch long at 90 minutes (including setup and teach), but probably down to 60 when people get a bit quicker at the decisions.

** Tried a second game with two players, advanced board and investors. Made for some amusing powers and tense bidding/bluffing situations. Fun stuff. **

Light accessible stock market game.  The theme is probably unattractively dry for many but the gameplay should have wide appeal.  Most of the game revolves around 'insider trading', by which I mean that you have incomplete information on stock price changes and you have to watch what everyone else is doing in order to guess at what they might know.

A good game, but it is not really how the market works. Then again the subtitle states that it is the game of insider trading. Indeed, the bidding process and the market manipulation using the forecast cards is fun. I know that the expansion includes the issue of bonds but they are fixed bonds that pay minimal. I wish there was a component that really showed how bonds worked especially the inverse relationship between price and yield. Including a forecast or random mechanism for interest rates which relates to bond prices/yields and which usually affects stock prices would have given the game a much more unpredictable and more realistic aspect to the game and how the market actually works. I do not think realism was the intention of the game though.

Extremely luck-driven game that seems imbalanced and would benefit from a lot more playtesting. Stanford Steel on the advanced side is only 2 steps from a stock split and receives dividends frequently, which results in frequent payouts, especially since there are +2 action cards and potential +4 insider information.

Interaction is very low. Components are moderately well-done.

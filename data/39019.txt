RATING: 3
Nov 14: Great tactical linear-warfare game, deeper, more rewarding than C&C but much longer. My favorite mechanics are the command and control rules, wing orders, and formation requirements, excellent! My favorite complex wargame.

Update after several plays: The programming built into the game is interesting, and if it weren't for interceptions and preemption it would play fast. However the constant die rolling and chart checking is inelegant, tedious and time-consuming. Unfortunately the  dependency on luck can make for deplorably frustrating and stale, boring game play.

Overcomplicated rules, but without reward of historical accuracy - some rules lead to very strange and unreal situations and the game forces players to "cheat rules" and punishes play with "common sense"; for example: the only effective way of retreating your very badly hurt unit from adjacent hex occupied by strong enemy unit without suffering loses is to order your unit to attack in melee.

I dislike disappearing your successfully charging cavalry from battlefield (it is some logic behind that, but it leads to weird decision making "I rather attack with weaker units at stronger enemy, 'cos I do not want my troops to disappear").

The activation system shines for this kind of tactical games but managing every counter on the board is fiddly, units transition to lots of states (which is managed by stacking more counters to the unit). I think this game could achieve similar results by removing some of its detail and minutia while keeping the command/activation system.

Comes with enough historic background to keep me entertained, will keep this game as a unique item in my collection, but I don't think I will get a lot of plays done.

RATING: 7.1
03/12/11 - Finished the Fehrbellin scenario yesterday.  A fun little scenario, and a GREAT introductory scenario.  From beginning to end, we played the whole scenario (with lots of talking and breaks and rules look-ups) in about 5.5 hours.  We are set to play the scenario again in the near future, and I would expect it to play in about three hours or less, if my opponent and I can keep the BSing to a minimum.

For now, my rating on this game is set at 7.1 to reflect a growing admiration for its rules system and a deeper understanding of the design goals.  For players new to wargaming, I highly advise having an experienced teacher for this game.  The rules are not only complex, but they are also nuanced.  The purpose for some rules is not apparent until you play the game and even then, you will undoubtedly forget much of the minutiae; this of course requires lots of game-stoppages in the first few games until you get the rules down.

I like this series, I give it a 7 rating usualy.

Here the subject is nto that interesting to me.

I played Fehrbellin: rating 4 - Boring scenario : frontal clash, no interesting terrain, no maneuver, mo particular army composition interest,  no other objective than destroying counters.

I looked at Malmo and it seemed way to limited in options for such an heavy system.

My first "proper" wargame.

The game covers battles from a war that I was admittedly unfamiliar with.  The system itself is fairly intuitive, albeit rather complex at times.  After the first couple turns of a battle, I can continue with fewer and fewer rule lookups, but if I don't play again for some time, I have to pretty much start over from scratch.

The system, the scenarios herein and the landscape of their battlegrounds all combine to result in some absolutely brutal battles.  They're rife with excitement and frustration and are really satisfying in the end.

I only wish I could play it face-to-face with someone...

Unbelievably high production value...not just the fantastic graphics (expecially the maps); the quality of the writing in the play books is perhaps the best I have ever seen in a wargame. Well written, well edited (only a handful of very trivial typos). I look forward to getting back into this series, my favorite tactical system. Need to find time to play!  
-----------------------------------------------------------

RATING: 6
Played Lund & Warksow - I think this is my least favorite entry in the MPBS series.  The battles are small and the terrain is pretty awful, which makes all the moving and fighting a lot more process intensive and makes everything take longer.  

I also harbor some suspicions about how it presents the Danish army, which seems to be rated rather well in my opinion.  For example, they are allowed the full momentum bonus from the very start of the war, whereas Robert Frost's account of Lund suggests they remained wedded to the caracole (which left them in a poor position to face the Swedish cavalry).  I don't claim to know more about this than the designer, but since the Swedish cavalry typically outfought its rivals in history, yet enjoys a difficult road in the game, I think the system might be a touch too generous in modeling their military capabilities.

Intricate system that takes a while to master, but all the bits fit together logically, and from them emerges a satisfying feel of the inflexibility of 17th century combat that seems natural rather than gamey (aside from the preemption/continuation mechanism which occasionally feels like an artifice). Graphics are colorful and evoke the era without resorting to faux antiqueyness. I was pleased to find that MPBS plays better by e-mail using VASSAL than some people suggested it would, and Knut's modules not only look good but do away nicely with most of the game's counter clutter.

RATING: 8
This is by far the most complex game I have ever played all the way through. I generally lean toward simple fast games like the old SPI games and recent offerings from "Victory Point Games". I'm usually looking for a game that plays in an hour or two. NGBG takes a solid hour to play a turn for a smallish scenario. But a lot happens in that hour. 

Each of the two opposing, armies on the map are divided into three wings, Left, Right and Center. Each of the wings is activated at least once per turn. What can be done with the individual units of the activated wing is largely determined by the "orders" for that wing and or the placement of the wings commander and the over all army commander. As each active unit performs actions with its units the opposing player may be able to react with his units. So though it may take a long time to crank out a turn both players are busy much of the time. This really salvages what could have been a really onerous game from the stand point of complexity.

The subject and the smaller maps are what inspired me to actually read the rules twice. Had this been just another WWII or Napoleonic game with a single map I probably would have only made it half way through the rules once. Then carefully boxed it all back up and listed the game for trade. But even though the rules had me scratching my head a lot I could see something was there. 

In 5 two to three hour games sessions we have played a scenario through only one and a half times. But I am still looking forward to my weekly session of this game. 

The main single strength of this game as far as I am concerned is that it is very immersive. Time can really fly while playing.

The main weakness is the plethora of game function markers that can stack up on the units (tweezers a must). It takes a whole GMT counter  tray just for the game function markers. with a little doubling up.

So all in all this has me thinking about getting other games in the series though I could easily see it taking at least a year to just work  through NGBG with one session a week.

IMHO one of the best of this amazing series. Just the historical commentary is worth the price alone. Lots of scenarios and variety and I love the small from factor for most of the battles.

And Excellent replay value to boot.

With more experience, the MPBS has grown on me. It is very swingy and chaotic, so it is about making the best of what you have and trying to convincingly and decisively breaking an opponent. 

=-=-=-
Very tentative. I have no idea how you are supposed to play this game. The actual flow of the battles is interesting and there is a lot of tension in trying to get your armies to do what you want. Compared to something like ASL, there are huge periods of time when your armies are in complete disarray and you spend 3 or 4 turns  put them back together. 

This battle is one that I had never heard of previously. The historical notes give a good sense of what was happening, but I wouldn't have naturally sought it out if I wasn't interested in trying the system.

The rating is for the series. I like the battle system a lot. It is elegant and well designed to simulate the warfare of the musket & pike era. The system is not that difficult but there is a lot going on and it is (at first) pretty difficult to remember what to do and when. Nothing Gained But Glory is a good volume for a beginner because it contains several small battles and some large ones for the future.

I had skipped this one but finally got it after having played Saints in Armor which stayed on the table for two months. Despite the obscure historical setting, the scenarios included are very interesting and more straightforward than the ones in SiA which cover more unusual tactical situations. With 7 battles included in the box this is a must buy if you like the serie and would make a good introduction because of the absence of tercios which simplifies things a bit.

Smaller battles (so far after first 2 scenarios), kind of a good step in this series. Missing a little bit the 2 hex units but that is due to the changes in organization in the end of 17th century. Captures quite good those changes. Keen to play the other ones
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.6
This is one of the BEST of the series.  If you like this system, this is a must buy.  The game is counter heavy.  Some may even say way too counter heavy.  The first couple of battles I did of this module had a little too much when it came to counter stacking.  

If you learn the system, this is an enjoyable experience!  I like to think of this is as ASL-lite.  The rules are less intense, but you have so much to do.  I really feel like I am commanding or trying to command an army.

Thumbs up to all.  

PS My only complaint is that my question do not always seem to get answered.  Oh well.  Maybe it is the way I ask question or how many questions I ask.

Having played two battles, neither overly balanced, I can still say that I like this title quite a bit. I'm now looking forward to Lund and Landskrona.

Yet, as I have commented for other games in the series--the weird battle end games (they seem to drag on), little use for lights/dragoons, colorless leaders, and other factors--the series is lacking color for me and not worth the time invested in playing out a battle. 

Could have used a little more poetry, in other words.

Game comes with 7 scenarios, more than any other Musket and Pike title. The battles are somewhat smaller than usual which may make it a good starting point for getting into the series. Included are 2 playbooks with background notes for each scenario plus more historical background material for the entire period. I am not an expert in Baltic history, but there aren't many English language sources covering this time period which makes the play books particularly valuable. The designers also found the space to update the battle of Cheriton module found in C3i magazine # 17. The newest version(5.0) rulebook rounds out the package. Overall a great value for the money.

Have yet to play this one as MPBS has developed into a bit of a beast, attaining a GBoH-like quality (i.e., too fiddly for me).

With a mix of large and small scenarios, there's tremendous value out of the box. After one playing, a solid 9. There's so much depth here - every decision is a potential double-edged sword. While there is some fiddliness, it's not enough to detract from the experience.

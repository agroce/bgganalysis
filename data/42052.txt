Gamer's game about producing wine in Portugal; great implementation of theme, and alot of strategy, seems to scale well from 2-4 players.

First off, this game should be recognized if only for the fact that it's the first game by this designer; this seems more like the work of an experienced, expert designer rather than a beginner.  This type of game is right up my alley, as I enjoy scalable heavy euros, and having an original and strong theme is a real bonus.  There are alot of moving parts, and this can make the rules a bit daunting at first, and the gameplay is a bit lengthy and prone to some AP.  That said, everything makes "sense" thematically (well except I wish there was a way to mass produce wine with just one vineyard), and plays smoothly once the rules are understood.  The many moving parts actually allows for multiple paths to score, which I like in my games.

The components and artwork are very good, the scalability is good (although 2-player wine fairs maybe not so much), and as mentioned the theme is great and its a deep game.  I am having some trouble figuring out how to play this well, and how to overcome/plan for significant weather fluctuations; a problem I've encountered is that if a player goes for the few strong wine strategy vs the many weaker wine strategy, the weather (which is a pretty random tile flip) can pretty much decide the outcome of the game.  Of course this could be due to my limited understanding of the strategy due to limited plays.  Either way I need to play this more.  AP'ers stay far away from this game, or better yet, learn to take your turns more quickly!!

2012-04-30: Rated 7 after one play.  Lots of interesting things going on (good), but mechanically similar to several other Euros (okay).  However, unlike most other Euros, the theme is present and not merely tacked on.

2012-05-08: Another 2 player game under my belt leaves me thinking about different strategies that I'd like to play (good).  Rating moving up to a 7.5.

It is a complex, inter-locking heavy Euro. The theme is well integrated, but the brain will burn in the rotation of actions. To be sure, I enjoyed it - but not a game that needs to be in my collection due to limited chances of it seeing the table.

RATING: 8.85
An absolutely beautiful complex, deep, and challenging economic-simulation Euro.  All of the mechanics are fairly intuitive, but without prior experience of the game it can be a bit challenging to figure out how they all work together.  

I'd love to get this one to the table more often, but it is challenging enough that even serious gamers have to be in the right mood for it, unless (like me) they are the types who specifically find brain-burning enjoyable.

Amazing that this is Vital's first title--it definitely feels like it was made by a seasoned developer.  I'm the proud owner of the non-deluxe edition, since I prefer its art direction more (though I loved Ian's art style much more with a title like [i]The Gallerist[/i]) and I feel that the deluxe version was overwrought by the time the Kickstarter finished due the inclusion of far too many "mini expansions" (part of why I hate the stretch-goal-obsessed culture of Kickstarter, and the fact that every backer seems to have opinions on how the game is modified, irrespective of whether they actually have experience with game design or not).

Too bad. You have plenty of actions but only 6 turns to construct your strategy: I couldn't enjoy this game in this way. Furthermore rules are full of exceptions and complex and take too much time to explain them.

Rules explanation has been longer than both games I've played, I didn't find the overall package was as good as the sum of its parts, lots to do but in the end they all arrive at a similar place, not worth the rules investment for me. May come back to it with a group who know it well.

Really good Euro with a lot of cool moving parts. I like the theme a lot (even though it is pasted on fluff). And every particular mechanic has a bit of 'neat' to it. No one mechanic is hard to understand or clunky. You just have to learn all the different pieces and how they fit together. 

It has nice depth, but perhaps not as much as I'd expect from the degree of complexity that the rules carry. That isn't necessarily a bad thing, but I think that the fairly high degree of complexity masks what is really only a moderate degree of decision making. That is, there is a bit too much overhead for the payoff in gameplay decisions. But it's still a very good, neat Euro.

I enjoy it.

I dunno ... with two the board doesn't really fill up and the game flies by and there are just so many things to do and areas to score points ... it was sort of like what I felt about Endeavor in that not a whole lot of the board got filled out.

It feels sort of abstract and there are lots of rules to consider. I'll have to play it some more.

Wooow, that's what I'm talking about when I ask for a game with a new, original way, of using an old mechanic. 

The action choosing based on the 3x3 square is awesome, and very original (at least for me), and I can't remember when it was the last time I played a game with a commom mechanic so originally implemented.

Also, although it's an euro, the game has good theme implemented, with the feel that you're making the wine, selling it, letting it become better with time, storing it. The components sure help on that feeling, but c'mon, I'm a ameritrasher after all! =P

Another excellent Lacerda! It sure is a complex game, but seems a bit easier to understand at first than The Gallerist. Still, there are a lot of choices to make, and with only 12 actions, every action really counts. This game combines strategy with tactic, with the latter being a bit more important. You have to see what others do, and respond to it. But no doubt about it, this is a fantastic game.

Un eurogame más que no aporta nada. Y sus principales problemas son la sobrecomplejidad de reglas y la sobresaturación de mecánicas que impiden madurar una estrategia de partida clara.

El típico juego que acabas vendiendo porque nunca apetece jugarlo. Nunca es el momento de quemar a tus compañeros con una explicación de reglas de 1 hora...

Es denso sin un beneficio claro a cambio de esa complejidad. Al contrario, tanta densidad le resta diversión a un tema en principio atrayente.

Sin duda es un pastiche, aunque los componentes son bonitos. Pero claro, con eso solo no vale.

+ Interesting economic euro game. Blends several mechanics into what is a nice game to explore. Scales well from 2 to 4 players and looks great (except for the board which looks way too busy for my taste). It also has much more theme than your average euro.
- It feels a bit... rigid. It provides a bunch of tools and mini-games but I'm not sure they're all relevant for making it a good game.

The game is loaded with intricate mechanisms, perhaps slightly to its own detriment, but individually they're not all that complex, only when you bring them all together it can be a chore to learn and remember. That said, I find it dripping with the theme, where others feel it's dry, and it's really a brilliant translation of Portuguese wine making and buying on a purely aesthetic and economic level, but not one I'd recommend for newer players to the Euro style. There's a lighter option called Viticulture for that, but if you do love the brain burn, and many do, Vinhos is your game.

Oh my god, what a beast of a game! This is without doubt THE heavy economic gamer's game of 2010!
There's a lot going on in Vinhos, and the number of moving parts is (at first) overwhelming. But everything makes sense, both for the theme AND as part of the game. AND every action is important (each player has only 12, plus some bonus), AND money is scarce, AND there's multiple paths to victory...
At the end of my first play, I did grasp less than half of the nuances of the game, but was left with that smell of grandeur that only potential masterpieces can give. However, I must also admit that it could have been streamlined a little more during development, because the multitude of mechanics feels a bit too much and teaching the game to new players is a painfully long process...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

07/12 - Frustratingly tight with money. You only get 12 actions in total, but I really enjoy how the game plays.  There are quite a few different strategies one can take.

07/14 - I've played 15 times now, and I'm much better at manipulating the extra actions. While I'm sure I'll never sell this one, I'm not sure how much more replay value there is in it.

The theme got lost in the mechanics.
Exampe: I am going to take this wine with a value of 9 to the fair. It will be worth 9, right? No, you have to transform it into (let's say) three expert icons. So the wine is worth three? No, with the icons you can select a combination of colours, which have points. So the wine's value is the value of those colours? No, you have to have experts with that colour. So if I have four red experts and I selected the red icon, I can multiply the red points by four? No, only by three because you could only turn the original value into three expert icons, not four... What's the theme of this again again? I've forgotten.

wow.  I think this is my new favourite game.  The theme is there and all the parts work together very nicely.  It has a reputation of being difficult to learn/ teach.  NOT TRUE!  It is really easy to understand if you've played a few eurogames.  The rule book is perfect.  There is a lot to remember but the icons are fantastic and remind you of almost everything.  Download the super good 2 page player aid from the file pages here.  That's all you need.  So many choices, but you can only do a few things so make every action count!  Beautiful, beautiful game.  Love it!!  This is a top top game and should be ranked higher.  I think it should be a top 10, but at least in the top 50.  It's much much better than Trajan that is ranked higher.

First Play: Ouch! Even with a player with 2 previous games under their belt, this still took an hour to explain. 30 mins into the explanation one player bravely confessed to being utterly lost and asked to be excused. This is a heavy Euro with many options, lots of fiddly rules and just so many possibiliites. This is an experienced gamer's game. This will not be everyone's cup of tea.

Starting off with 2 vineyards from a choice of 8 estates, you gradually improve your set up, more vineyards,  wineries, cellars and wine experts contribute to the value of your wine. Then either sell them for money, punt them off to a wine fair or stake them out for game end points.

The game is played over 6 years with 2 general actions, a banking action and a production phase. There are 3 fairs which earn additional points.

To be successful you have to maximise your engine, stop others tripping you up and be mindful of what they are aiming for. Try to do the opposite.

Possibly the most complex game I have ever played on a number of levels. Write the first game off as a learning exercise. Can't wait for my second game.

Second play the rules came alot easier. Great game upped rating

The first impression is that the game is easier to play than to explain.
There are a lot of actions avalaible and apparently several strategies. The tactic is based on taking the best opportunity avalaible hampering other players action picking.
The downside is that the game is dry, and it seems more a job than a game. My first game wasn't so fun.

Heavy strategy game and a good follow-up to the great Vasco da Gama. It is significantly more complicated and the first game takes forever, however I can imagine that with 2 or 3 plays under the belt this will be finished much faster. It is very complex because of the multitude of possible actions, and very fiddly because of all the tiny pieces. I like the theme very much and the artwork is great. Almost no player interaction is the biggest downside of this game. A few more actions would have been nice too in order to allow for more long-term strategies.

Vinhos is a good game although being a mix of "a little this" and "a little that", there are many games mechanics blended inside Vinhos.

The result is a good game but not a top noch one as people have say IMHO. Probably too fiddly for what you get back.

*update*

After the second game, my impression is that Vinhos is a really bad game, it's like you eat Brass, In the year of the dragon, Hamburgum,... and then you threw up a game. The result is not the same and stinks.

Too fiddly and too inelegant.

A complex and interesting economic game that is meaty and long (brain-burning at times).  Too much to do and too little money or too few actions to accomplish everything, which I guess is the sign of a good game.  The game is pretty fiddly but this is partially because there are lots of ways to score points... so naturally, one would think that there should be multiple paths to victory (but it's hard for me to say after just one play).  

That said, it seems critical to enter a wine in the wine fair that will allow you to place a barrel or two on the A/B/C people/distributors at the top of the board because it is pretty much the only way to get extra actions on future turns (by discarding a crappy wine and moving your barrel around on the "free action & end-game VP areas" at the top of the board).

This is in the top 5 for 2011.  A very solid engine building game with multiple paths to victory.  There may be a bit too much chrome on the game, but I really enjoy playing it.  Plays excellently from 2 to 4 players.  Weather can make this game a bit fickle but it affects both palyers equally.  Getting a couple of good value vineyards is important and then strategies diverge with either beefing up the two and working exports/local sales or expanding to 4 and working the extra actions and the fairs.

Es un eurogame de los pesados,para cuatro jugadores. Cada jugador va a ser productor de vinos de portugal. El juego se desarrola en seis años. Cada año tiene dos turnos, un turno de matenimiento y producción. al final del 3,5 y 6 años hay un concurso de vinos, donde según qué vinos tengamos y qué parámtros se valores más del vino, podremos obtener puntos de concurso. Según como quedes en el curso sumas determinados puntos de victoria. Incluye una mecánica de colocación de trabajdores, pero con un solo trabajador. Hay muchas opciones. Comprar viñedos, contratar un enólogo, comprar bodegas o casas de vino, vender (para conseguir dinero) o exportar (para conseguir puntos de victoria) el vino.. en fin. Es un pedazo de juego muy pensado y que hará las delicias de auquellos a los que les gusten los juegos de gestión de recursos.
Muy recomendable, pero no apto para no iniciados.

RATING: 4
Everything-but-the-kitchen-sink euro. The quadrel, the multitude of scoring, the micro-economics, the banking, the micro-score track race (ie the wine fair), the favours, the bonus actions, the dual function tiles. It's all there.

The theme definitely shines through. It all still comes together despite the piling on of mechanics. The wheel wasn't reinvented here, but it is one big tire that rolls.

Warning: this is a Gamer's Game. There is too much going on here for anyone but a hardcore geek to get through the 1h15m explanation and long play time (50 minutes per player for first time players).

Dec 31, 2010 Update: Have now played 3 times. It's too finicky and too long for what it offers. Lots of down time. To play well, you have to analyse every move and calculate all the point differentials. This one won't make it to the game table too often because of the lengthy game play. 

Plus, there is distinctly an advantage to the player who gets to sell first in Year 2, blocking all the good and available sell spots.

Great theme which alone would have been enough for me to purchase the game. Fortunately the game itself is also very interesting even though the first half of the first play was very confusing. There's a lot of ways to score and actually quote a few actions to fulfill all the superb strategies one has.

Definitely a game which needs more plays to shine and hopefully I'm able to get it on the table soon enough.

Certainly an interesting game that feels heavy and complicated at first, but which feels well integrated and consistent by the end of the first play.  We certainly need to play this again relatively soon, just so that we don't entirely forget how to play it.

The end of the game also came completely out of thin air, as I had not noticed that on the third level there were only 2 turns, which meant that a lot of my longer term planning was completely irrelevant. 

The theme is consistent and well thought out and I suspect wine fans would get a kick out of it.  Initial rating 8 for quality of the game (7 for desire to play it).

Decent, fairly heavy Euro with solid mechanics and an original theme. There are a lot of ways to win, which makes it a difficult game to master. Lots of replayability here. 

I am not a fan of the "move your guy only one space for an action" mechanic, and thought that it was pretty lame having to spend half a turn just going to the bank, but I wasn't being very careful about collecting bonus actions with my barrels. I probably just need to play it a little more.

While the initial impression may be that this is a 'kitchen sink' design, which includes absolutely everything (weather, size & quality of vineyards, ageing of your wines and even the impact of enologists - to name just some!), and you're tempted to speculate on whether there's scope to cut down, you can only admire the way that pretty much every factor not only adds to the richness of the tactics and decision making but remains consistent thematically.  All four of us adopted pretty different approaches but all were competitive - a very promising sign.  A partial first play as a precursor to a full session had impressed and made me look forward to exploring at greater length in the expectation that my rating would increase  - and it did.

RATING: 6
Vinhos is a solid, heavier weight strategy game of producing wine, and then selling/exporting that wine in order to make money/score points.

The game is driven by a kinda-sorta worker placement system that gives you 9 available actions.  However, from those 9 actions, there are a ton of things to do, and a lot of ways to get them done.  You'll be selling wine to clients, exporting win to other countries, using some wine to attract experts that allow you to do extra things, sending wine to a fair to compete against the other wine makers, etc.  So, a multitude of ways to score points, and a bunch of strategies you can pursue.

Overall, I liked it pretty well, but probably wasn't super excited about it to where I'd seek it out often.  Would play if other people wanted to though.

While I enjoyed the tension of trying to obtain as many points as possible considering how few turns there are in the game (twelve) and how little cash you have, this game is brutal to learn. The board is well-mapped out, which helps once you start playing, but teaching the rules is brutal. Especially with all the specifics for the wine experts, the bonuses, and the vineyards.

Played it, so far, only once and with three. My guess is, the game needs to be played with four to truly be enjoyed.

If I wasn't a wine lover, I'm not sure I would consider this game worth playing considering just how complicated it is.

Captures a lot of the essence of the wine industry, which we love.  Just like in real life, the terrible weather can destroy your perfect schemes and force you to scramble, as you dump wine on the open market in a desperate attempt to make a quick profit.  For us, it scales beautifully for all player counts.

RATING: 8
The theme is so integrated into the mechanics that everything makes total sense immediately, despite the significant rules overhead. This is the perfect example of only adding extra rules/chrome to a game if it is easily understood by evoking the theme. It never feels like a resource conversion game since there is only one currency, so despite its thick ruleset never feels as bewildering to me as something like Glass Road or Trajan.

Other players can't really derail your efforts, so it does play a bit like a solitaire engine builder. It doesn't feel that way for me though. There is just enough player interaction for me through the competition for selling/exporting wine, the endgame scoring spots, and the wine fair. And the economy within the game is so brilliantly rendered that I can easily overlook it.

It's a good game, but I can't rate it higher because it definitely seems busy and stuffed, and it brings out AP in people that don't normally even have it.  Play it with someone who does, and I suspect you're sunk.

Also, with 4, you might have so much blocking that it'd be a problem, and the game would be eternal.  With 2, you'd get a better playing time, but little interaction.  So 3 is probably best.

Tons of stuff going on.  Even though there are only 12 actions total for the game, the depth of those decisions are remarkably deep.

Vinhos could not better represent all that I hate in certain modern boardgames. Interaction that could best be described as 'incidental interference', complexity without texture, a game arc that is dictated by a processional march through phases, decisions that are all the same damned size thus making winning the game just an exercise in accreting slightly better decisions (and of course, incidentally interfering with your opponents), a total lack of anything resembling a super-critical, oh-my-God-what-do-I-do moments, and no ambiguity about the meaning of the decisions you are faced with. But it has multiple paths to freakin' victory! Whoopee! I HATE multiple paths to victory. It implies that there are paths. There is no 'off-the-path'. And with time the paths get worn. Blech. Blech blech blech. Sorry. I'll get it together.

Vinhos is a tight, almost claustrophobic beast of a worker placement game, where you only have 12 actions for the whole game. The vital twist is, in typical Lacerda mode, to try and squeeze as many extra actions as possible without sacrificing your long-term plan of action. It is an efficiency game, constrained by the ingenious and yet simple square rondel system and the tightness of available money. The game is strongly thematic with its mechanisms being mostly supported by the theme. The game opening is a customization exercise in trying to establish an asymmetric advantage over your opponents, but again constrained by the necessity to buy at least 2-3 vineyards to be competitive. To finish off the design, you choose your own scoring goals, again under the pressure of your opponents that can snatch your goals before you do. It is not a hard game to teach, but requires an well-versed teacher. Overall, a gamer's game, and one of the most important euros of the last 10 years. Don't go for the 2016 Deluxe version, this is the real deal (with the published variants).

+ Highly thematic, with mechanisms that eloquently support the theme
+ Action and money tight, well-balanced, and puzzley, a wonderful forward optimization problem
+ The banking system is ingenious, it is a pity it was left out of the 2016 Deluxe version
+ The asymmetric powers of the regions, expert tiles, extra action tiles etc are wonderfully intriguing, yet elegant and well thought out
+ The components are solid, and the art by Marianno Iannelli is exceptional, as is most of his work

= Very high player interaction, that requires understanding of the state of your opponents
= The weather tiles can influence the general richness and flow of strategies, so you need to be prepared for this
= Requires heavy action programming and planning and thus mental focus is needed throughout to play well

- Requires a well-versed teacher to teach newbies, and the first game will be thrown away as a teaching game
- Officially printed player aids would have been well-appreciated

RATING: 5
This game scared me shitless with its rulebook, but in practice the amount of rules wasn’t truly an obstacle. My partner, who ran away screaming with Brass, thought this ‘doable’. I think the main reason why it is ‘doable’ is because the actions themselves are, with the exception of the press release, pretty straightforward and simple; also the main engine of the game isn’t complex: once you have wine (which is a fairly automatic process) it is nearly impossible not to obtain points or money with it straight after. That doesn’t mean that the choices involved are simple: they aren’t, if anything because there are a lot of them.

Once you’ve worked your way through the rule book and played the first game you’ll realise that Vinhos is, in fact, a variation on the tried-and-tested collect resource and convert it to VP genre. It doesn’t involve a lot of interaction between the players in the sense that you must carefully consider the game state and options of your opponents (as would be the case in competitor wine game Grand Cru): this is all familiar euro territory with quite a lot of indirect interaction. It’s just ‘a bit’ more involved than the average game.

After having played a number of games I’m slowly coming to the conclusion that I kinda-like the entire thing, but at the same time I wonder whether it’s not too elaborate and ‘gamey’ for its own good. Let me give a few examples. First, the investment bar. The game is constructed such that you only get cash by making a withdrawal from the bank, but that involves you moving to that space on the quadrel and taking the action. This is rather expensive in terms of your action potential, hence the addition of the investment bar which allows emergency withdrawals at any moment. Had the game been designed around cash all the way, then this entire aspect could have been simplified. Second, the wine experts. Their ability to alter the characteristics of the wine overlaps with the job of the enologists, so why does the game have two types of wine expert? Well, as it turns out the experts are not really [i]wine[/i] experts, they are [i]financial[/i] and [i]marketing[/i] experts there to aid you in the difficult process of selling a quality wine to a large nation-wide audience instead of a small local audience. This part of the game is not ‘themed’ correctly, or better phrased, not [i]illustrated[/i] correctly. Third, the fair itself: with the aid of the above it makes a lot more sense, but it can’t hide the fact that it is a rather abstract number juggling business meant to distribute 72 points in total. Fourth: the game permits players to purchase wineries, cellars and enologists before they have an actual vineyard. Given the current quadrel structure with just one action square where vineyards can be purchased the premature construction is necessary to present the players with a larger and more sensible choice of actions. And so forth. There are all good reasons why the game works the way it does, but at the same time it begins to stress uncomfortably the fact that the players become operators of complex machinery trying to squeeze out as much points from the engine as possible rather than find their own way in complex emergent structures built on simple ground rules. In fact one of my fellow players remarked that he found it difficult to judge how well everyone was doing, and I regret to say I agree with him.

Vinhos appears to have lots of dials and knobs for the players to fiddle with, and the fact that these all seem rather balanced with respect to each other is an impressive achievement. At the same time I'm beginning to wonder where exactly the [i]game[/i] is in the entire affair. Of course players can chose from tons of different paths to victory, but the game offers little in the sense of progression and competition between players. I don’t have a feeling of being more clever with my limited resources than my opponents: the only way to establish that is going through the motions of the entire game and then state: yes (or no), I was (or wasn’t) more efficient. Despite the title apparently working fine, it is for this reason that I’m hesitant to increase my rate for it: I cannot see myself playing this anything but tactically, with the strategy inserted by whatever idea most appeals to me that day. In other words, there doesn’t seem to be a need to be strategically clever with Vinhos. You can try, but will be swamped by the span and depth of the decision tree.

So for now: solid title, great for fans of lots of complex machinery, but not simple and elegant as a whole and not really challenging the [i]human[/i] aspect of our cognitive powers which makes us so good at Go compared to the average computer.

[b]Update[/b] I let the game to a new wine lover in the hope that there the raw nuts and bolts of the design would be appreciated more. This step really was inevitable given that I hadn't played the game in well over two years, and that it would always be pre-empted by other designs. Consequently the rate has also dropped by one point to reflect my (semi-)final judgment on it. I do not expect to see nor play this game ever again.

My initial impression of this game is like taking your first sip of a Malbec - heady, complicated, and you're not sure if you like it.  But the more you think (or drink), the more you appreciate its layers.

This is too complex to describe in a few sentences - I'll just say that it incorporates the theme very well and the components are really great.  Once you've mastered the rules (no easy feat), the playtime isn't all that long.

Looking forward to more plays so I can get underneath what I suspect is a great game.  For now - it's quite good.

What a game this is.. First of all, I was scared to approach it because I have heard so many about how complex, heavy and hard to understand Vinhos is. After watching a Rahdo runs through video, reading the rulebook with attention, I put the game on the table and played a solo game. It was amazing. Don t get me wrong, Vinhos is a heavy eurogame; but it has one of the best rulebooks I have ever red, everything you need to know is written there and every action has an example on the right side of the page. It has a great flavour. Absolutely fantastic business simulation eurogame.

Simply put, I have not been this impressed with what most consider a "Euro-style" game in a very long line of new games.

The game is a finely-crafted merging of multiple mechanisms allowing you to work toward multiple opportunities for victory points, but the emphasis is on how well balanced those different methods for VPs are.  

There is no perfect path through the game - your strategy will always rely in part on concession in one area or another.  This is in part due to the very limited (12) number of normal actions you get during the game.  That, in turn, requires you to focus on managers, which will get you more actions and opportunities for more VPs, but only while impacting the other aspects which require your attention.

Vinhos is, all told, a delicious puzzle every playing, where other players do not always undermine your plans, but certainly can interfere in nearly everything.

I studied the rules of this game extensively and felt that I got the sense of the basic mechanics. It seems like would be difficult to remember everything. I created a couple of cheat sheets for the game. When I finally sat down to play I had to refer back to the rules to answer questions several times. My friends became bored and eventually we agreed to stop playing. Now this could be my fault due to perhaps a mental incapability to learn rules, but I think that the game may just be really heavy. If I could get some of my friends to sit and play it a few times until we got the hang of it, I think it would be a great game. It has a terrific theme and a lot of strategy.

Heavyweight euro, needlessly complex.

Just getting through the rulebook is a game in itself.  I recommend downloading the player aid by PBrennan to assist you in keeping track of what you can do when, because the rulebook has no interest in whimpy things like summaries.

Once you get going, it's fun for a while.  Then the super-long turns set in, and you make up stories in your head just for something to do, and you curse the day your friends decided to buy dining chairs with unpadded seats.  With four players, you're not getting a lot of change from four hours.

The rule book is scarey, it took me 3 sittings to get through it and, and i was dreading trying to teach the fair/press releases to my group. The wierd thing is , once we played through the game i looked back at the rules and couldnt understand why they were so long as the game play is actaully quite simple, its just the stratagies and timing of stuff you need to get right.

Anyway , cool game, took quite a long time to play and requires a fair bit of mental planning, it helps if you dont get distracted by other peoples moves and use your out-of-turn time to come up with a plan - and backup plan in case someone takes the action you wanted and you end up not being able to afford it.

This game lacks a lot of tension, it's pretty much not even there with 2 players and barely there with 4. It's not like if I don't get my move I'm completely hosed except in rare circumstances. The progression feels pretty linear too. While my moves were affected by other players it wasn't in an interesting way. Instead of taking a 5 star rated move, I'd take a 4.5 star rated move. There are often so many good moves, it's hard to care about losing a particular one.

That sort of stuff might show up in the end game scoring, but it's not particularly tense or compelling while playing.

This is only after 2 plays so maybe it would change but there's so many other games to play...

Big game. After several plays, I'm still getting the hang of it.

It's surprising just how often you can end up one move or one barrel or one dollar short on just about anything.

I'm considering a little do-it-yourself variant where the 9 action spaces could be randomly placed (like Royal Palace), instead of fixed. This might add more variety to the action selection and planning.

Preordered at Essen 2010.

Vinhos is a good game, yet overly complicated and a bit too much elaborate and gamey. At its heart, it is a patchwork of all the well-known german heavy-weight games mechanics. An action selection driving mechanism which looks like an advanced rondel, an increasing frequency scoring round a la Agricola, a "free" additional action favor mechanic similar to Caylus, all packed in a Die Macher weight class game.

Several gears not perfectly oiled (indeed three fundamental "official variants" are recommended by the author), and the desperate need to have four working estates definitely narrows the apparently large decision tree.

A good game, but not the "definitive gamers' game" as it was announced in the pre-Essen 2010 hype campaign.

Meaty, complex with a lot of things you want to do and very, very few actions in which to do them. There are a lot of ways to build your engine up and to get victory points. However its essentially a racing worker placement game so it can boil down to finding a strategy line which other players aren't pursuing and pushing on it.  Does a nice job of presenting the wine business (including the critical aspect of getting critics on side). I like it (and I like wine making) but its not getting much replay.

As someone else wrote, this game is too complex for its own good. At some point in the development of any game, players have enough decisions to make; adding another mechanism just lengthens the game (and increases its downtime) without really making the players' decisions any more interesting. Vinhos passes that point. In particular, I think exporting could have been dispensed with.

A lot of this game works and is fun.  I enjoyed building up the wineries to produce wine that they could be used in various capacities, where the quality of the wine may or may not matter.  But I think this game falls apart at the end of season shows.  First of all, the value of the wine you send is completely dependent on the value of the spot you pick, nothing to do with the wine.  That in turn is often a function of how early you send the wine in the season.  Very anti-thematic and counter intuitive, in a game that should have had the room to breath to make fully fitting mechanisms.  Also, the game is set up to slow down painfully.

Lots of rules but in fact quite easy to play. Reasonable playing time as well. I'm a bit concerned that if someone really must super-optimize their moves the playing time will go through the roof.

Like the way everything is connected, and that you have to mix different quality wines for best results.

Lots of stuff going on.  There were a lot of rules for a relatively simple game.  That's usually not a good sign.  But I did end up liking this one.  The fairs were an interesting mechanism...almost like a game w/in a game.  Influencing the judges/tasters seems like a key component to get extra actions.  This means that getting all 4 vineyards populated early is important.

[b]Vinhos[/b]

[ImageID=804899]

Vinhos, by newcomer designer Vital Lacerda, is a meaty, thematically tight gamer’s game that focuses on the business of wine making. In it, each player is dedicated to running a profitable set of estates, turning produced wines into victory points over the course of six years and three wine festivals.

Action selection is handled in a square rondel system, with it costing money to move to spaces that are not adjacent to your pawn or are occupied by other players or the tax marker. The actions themselves serve to manipulate the ability to manipulate the value of wines, provide special player powers, to present wines for the wine fair early, or to translate the wines into victory points or cash, and to manipulate investments and cash on hand. The actions themselves are relatively straightforward, with tension coming from the limited number of actions (12) available in the game, the tightness of the money supply, and the competition for the limited supplies of production resources and spots for generating points and income.

If this seems like your typical, tight economic game so far, you are right. What really sets this game apart in my mind, and really made me interested in trying it at BGG.Con, is the extra action system that is intertwined into the game. I would almost go so far as to say that the game is about the pursuit for extra actions and how and when you use them over the course of the game.

At the end of the third, fifth, and sixth years there is a wine fair where each player can present a wine, gaining fair points for meeting the right criterion. If the presented wine meets certain conditions based on the current weather tile, then the player is allowed to place some of their limited barrels onto the managers whose condition they met. As the game progresses, wines can be discarded to move these barrels around, giving specific bonus actions depending on the manager and, later in the game, the opportunity to move the barrels permanently into victory point multipliers.

This system adds an additional level of decision making into the game, forcing you to consider not only when and how you will convert wines into victory points and money, but also when it is worth it to discard a wine in order to get an extra action. Sometimes the decision is obvious, such as when you have a bad wines that aren’t going to be useful for anything else, or are about to lose a wine to the aging process. Other times it becomes more difficult, such as when some more valuable wines, and you have to seriously weigh the advantages of being able to get an extra action by discarding the wine vs. being able to turn that wine in for victory points or cash. Additionally, if you want to get the extra actions available from the managers you have to either send a wine to the fair early, in which case you are giving up a regular action and potentially hurting your position at the fair, or you are waiting until the fair occurs and not using an action, but are losing out on some of the bonus actions you could get from the wine fair and maybe not meeting enough requirements to put two barrels into the extra actions area.

RATING: 7
A worker action game with an amazing amount of depth. The rules are slightly convoluted and difficult to remember. The Well implemented theme helps with some of the rule memorizing. All the working elements come together for a very tight and deep game. It might be over some peoples heads but it is my kind of game. The reputation cubes are very important in this game and the special abilities can really move you forward. It loses a couple points for not being easy to learn and difficult to memorize the rules. But otherwise it is a wonderful game

Players are wine makers in Portugal, trying to earn prestige by producing fine wines. Meaty game with lots of cogs. Boiled down, players produce wines each year and then take two actions, selling, exporting, improving their estate and so on.  By presenting a wine at the wine fair, you can start tapping the three wine experts for extra actions - vital for success.  Three times during the game there is a wine fair, which is like a mini game for buckets of points. Tight, angst ridden game, driven by a tight need for money. Six turns and twelve actions doesn't add up to a long game in theory, but there is lots to ponder here. Early four player games will take hours. Experienced two player games will fly. Good game, once the "huh?" bubble is popped.

The game is excellent. I [-]am selling[/-] sold it because of the [b]Deluxe Edition[/b] I backed on Kickstarter.

Great and pretty complex Euro with a theme that you can really engage with. There are many bits and mechanics and the board is always busy. Action selection "roundel" is well used here as well as a way to use bonus actions in your turn. Game goes really smoothly after few plays and can be tough and very competitive.

[b]Update:[/b] Rating modified according to a custom rating system.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Aging of the wine in a cellar. The longer the wine stays in the cellar the more quality it gets to sell, export or present it on the fair. Without the cellar, it will spoil.

This is a beautiful, challenging and thematic game.  Vinhos is not an easy game, but is very rewarding once you play it.  The rule book is very good.  However, the walkthrough that was written by the author as a geeklist is excellent. It clears most of the doubts and really explain the game in an easy and deeper way.
The theme in Vinos is very well developed and you really feel like you're managing a wine company. The scoring at the end is exiting because the leadership changes every now and then. Vinhos is a game that has multiple paths to victory.  At the end of the game you have the feeling that you have acomplished a lot.

RATING: 9.5
I love this game and it remains my favorite among Vital Lacerda’s increasingly impressive body of work. I don’t think the game caught on as well as his others due to the fact it’s harder to explain than to actually play. The Wine Fair is a game-within-the game construct that is pretty mind bendy and fiddly. The new Deluxe Version coming out may streamline this, we’ll see, but I do like the idea very much of competing at the end of a round for best wine as it’s thematic and it gives the players an optional VP path to pursue. 

I’ve “only” got three winemaking games (Viticulture and Grand Cru), so I’m probably partial to the genre but this is my favorite. There are 6 turns and only 12 total actions. The game starts out slow and tight but then you build your winery engine and start squeezing out extra actions so you can snipe opportunities away from your opponents. I love that Vital gives players the space for some creativity to sacrifice resources for extra moves.

See, a hallmark of Lacerda games is the freedom to eke out extra actions so you can do the occasional power move.  You’ve got the kickouts in both CO2 and The Gallerist and the Knowledge Points in Kanban. Here you use crates of the wine your make. That is, some of your wine is for sippin' and some for shippin' -- to wine experts who reward you with a hearty, [i]Thanks for the wine! Here, take another turn.[/i] In this way, you can manage to string together a series of actions that give you mid-turn bonuses and extra actions such that you ship your wine somewhere an opponent was just about to.

The path to victory is a choose-your-own affair of shipping wine barrels to VPs spots or for money. Or fighting to dominate the Wine Fair though our experience has shown that is not a necessity. Naturally, your wines age and become more valuable and you’ve got the usual upgrade tropes of euro games to increase your wine qualities. I find it all comes together thematically; even weather is a turn-to-turn consideration. 

We play with the post-release recommended rules of reverse turn order purchase of the first vineyard and a limit on how much the endgame bonus for money can yield (12 VP). I expect these will become standard in the Deluxe Version.

--Vinhos is a great game that may be one of the shining stars of this year
Will give a preliminary rank of 8.5 because of the time involved.

This game is one of my absolute favorites.  Love the theme, and how strongly the theme is carried out inside the game's mechanics.  It can take a while to play (realistically it takes 3.5+ hours to play with 4 players).  The shortest timeframe I can expect this playing might be inside 2.75 - 3 hrs with experience (about 3/4hrs per player).

This game requires a lot of thought and planning.  I don't believe there is any straightforward winning strategy.  I also don't think the game suffers from "too many rules".  It isn't "fiddley", and once the whole system is fully grasped it all makes sense.  I also love the use of gaining bonus actions (which Feld's Trajan and Castles utilize to their fullest extent).

I find the entire experience of Vinhos extremely rewarding, and is one of the best boardgames I have ever experienced.  Grade: A+

A longish game consisting of a collection of loosely-connected subsystems.  This leads to an overly-long first explanation of the rules, as each subsystem must be explained and put into context.  It is extremely thematic, however, and many aspects of the wine industry are represented.  
Rulebook could be better; still had no real idea how everything fit together after studying it for 30-40 min.
Suspect it will be a difficult game to introduce to newbies, and hard to build up a group of knowledgeable, dedicated players enough to bring the playing-time down.  Currently I feel it's a 2-hr game that takes 3-4hr to play, thus wearing out its welcome by the end.

This game is involved. Even if you just look at the board you can see no less than 8 different regions with very different functions. In addition, there are only 9 different actions you can take on a turn but when you consider that during a whole game you can only execute 12 of them in total the direction Vinhos is trying to take you in becomes a little clearer: There is an abundance of options, but the game is mostly using them to tease you. Even more than a game like Agricola, Vinhos forces you to focus as you simply cannot do everything. The consequences for failing to do so may not be quite as harsh but it will show in final scores.

The game carries with it a lot of up-front complexity but it's surely worth it. A recommendation for people who like their games complex if a bit dry, although I am wondering about replayability a bit. The obvious complexity might be in the mechanics more than in actual gameplay.

The fair is a cool goal in the middle of the game, but seems somewhat of a red herring. The weather also does not force players to adapt since they are affected equally and do not nearly have enough time to structure their production differently in response to a single turn's weather. The optimization may be too simplistic for a smaller headcount. With a full set of four players, the interaction from the action board becomes apparent.

This is a game I should like --medium weight Euro with many competing priorities.  However, it was clunky enough that it really fell flat.  Long, fiddly, unintuitive rules and mechanics that are far less than the sum of the parts.  Several rules and scoring seemed imbalanced to me (for example, start positions, 1 pt per $ seemed far too powerful), but I reserve judgment without further plays.  Far too few actions for its length, and enough downtime and AP to suck the fun out of it without the right crowd.  I don't find myself wanting to give it another chance, given how many strong games there are in this category.

What this game does, it does quite well. I am just not interested in it at all. A nit-pick of VPs here and there, despite being well integrated between the various ways of getting VPs it is a very dull and boring experience. Certainly not for me and a reminded of why I am moving farther and farther away from very pure euro style games. Just not fun at all. Two main problems: first almost no player interaction; second just a massive expanse of micro decisions to net a few points here or there. The decisions lack importance and the game is just a slog for VPs.

Your strategy can be dashed to bits if the bits are not drawn from the bag when you need them.  Hedging by playing two strategies has worked very well for me.  If a player concentrates on one strategy and the pieces drawn for the auction go his way then he will win by a long shot.

This a game that must be played typically with those who already played it a couple of times and do remember the rules. I myself really enjoy its theme as it helps to digests the rule-bits others tend to dislike - bear in mind wine making is bloody difficult. And harvest is not even included.
When playing it with beginners keep to the two or three players limit, it really helps as there's a lot to look out for and remember.
After five or six plays I like this game much more hence the 9 I gave to it. It might change with time you never know, but at this moment this is one of my favourite games.
I am a fan of the old version, nicer look, vivid colours. Needs a few plays' experience to understand and see everything is in place in the game and it is actually very well streamlined.

There are a lot of decisions to make during the game and while it can be interesting, they aren’t much fun. The biggest hurdle for the game is that there are too many different values. The wines are valued in both production and selling which can be modified in different ways, money can either be in your bank account or as cash, and there are both fair points and pure victory points. What I am saying is that the game obstructs the strategic view for the players, making it overly complicated.  Not only did it take long time to play, it felt long too.

Played with 3 took about 2.5 hours. The most complex euro I have ever played. The game made me feel thick because even by game end I had not got the rules clear in my head. Clever graphical board design presents a ton of info attractivally. I hope to play the game again in a few days with the same players and I fully expect my rating to jump a couple of points assuming I can get comfortable with the rules. May 2014

*UPDATE* 2nd time playing, again with 3, took just over 3 hours. By the end of the game I was finally in a position to say I know the rules. Gaining end game points is what the game is largely about and doing that successfully scrabbles my mind. I'm not upping my rating but with the same group of guys this game now works for me. I couldn't sit through training up new players, the learning process is so tortuous it is too ugly to witness. May 2014

I like the idea, even though there are plenty of other games that have the same theme. What I am getting sick of is the victory points based game. In this game you could just make the victory points the money you have, it would simplify the game and also accelerate it a little. Two important improvements in a game. I really don't see why there should be victory points in this game. I can clearly see the game without victory points... or should I say that the victory points are the amount of money you have at the end of the game.

Great thing about this game is that you don't need to read, everything is icon-based and there ain't too many of them.

It's still a good game, but I don't think I will buy it, I have too many games that, for me, are much better than this on my to buy list. But I would play if someone offered me the opportunity.

Took us an entire hour to explain the rules and then another 2 1/2 hours with three fast gamers to finish it.  As a player of games such as 18xx, Hannibal or War of the Ring I'm not afraid of long rules at all if the overall game concept is clear and well laid-out.  Vinhos however looks like two games pressed into one box: there is the half which is about making, selling and exporting wine and there is a second half about bringing your wine to the wine exhibition.  The whole exhibition thing feels like a pasted-on mechanic which turns an already complex game into a cumbersome Behemoth which loses any elegance it might have had before.

Bottom line: Too many rules, too many tables to look up things, too many details to consider and a playing time which is simply too high for abstract Euro-style games.  No, thanks!

Initial rating of 7 after second 3 player game.

There's a lot going on here.  Definitely liked it better the 2nd time.  More plays needed to determine if the payoff in meaningful decisions is worth the length.

A bit concerned about the learning curve.  Doesn't seem to be a game you could sit down with new players to teach them and have them enjoy it.

Well, I don't know what to say about this game.  My head still hurts thinking about it.  

This is probably going to rank up there with Die Macher for me.  Not only in my enjoyment of play, but it the lack of plays I get in.

There is so much going on and I've heard people say that if only they stripped a few things out.  But, I don't see it working if you did take stuff out.  It all works together.  There are some many things to do and so few actions to get it done in.

But, like Die Macher, I don't see me being able to teach it to too many people and the play time I don't think my group will be able to get down.

So, it's going to be one of those game that we all really enjoy when we get a play in, but will probably rarely get that play in.

While I can't understand all the comments about an overcomplicated and much to complex game etc., I don't see a very interesting game here (replayability wise). It's not bad and I would play it again, but to me it feels less interesting than other games that come with less rules.

However, it's not the monster ppl make out of it. It comes with 16 pages of rules, which isn't that much. Yeah, there are a few small rules most might forget, but it's nothing terrible. Anyhow, I agree that some of the stuff that's in this game doesn't help it.

RATING: 6
I played and enjoyed this, but it is so intricate I have forgotten entirely how it worked, and cannot bring myself to attempt the rulebook again. There are too many steps between your starting point and your eventual goal, the feedback loop is too loose to make the game feel rewarding in a way that makes most people want to play more I think.

This game made me realise the kind of game I hate: games where the game puts artificial feeling steps between you and achieving your objectives, making you feel like your turn might have been pointless. Which isn't to say Vinhos is bad: if you like incremental gain, and maybe some loss now for gain later, this if your game. But it just doesn't feel good enough, often enough for me. I want to feel smarter in a game.

This one is quite a challenge to teach, although this is hopefully rewarded by the depth of game play. There are many strategic considerations and the theme is perfectly integrated as you experience all the trials and tribulations of wine making. Has some flow / downtime issues, and is a little clunky at times, but overall a very satisfying game experience.

Vinhos is a terribly interesting game in which you actively manage a winery. From the very get go, and across the 6 years the game plays out under, the decisions are tight, tense, and you are fending off a constant bottoming out. The decisions are highly thematic and intuitive (you know, if you've spent any time in wine country; or alternately have watched Sideways). Do you invest highly in a particular region to develop an incredibly rich wine? Do you spread yourself out to mass produce cheap zinfandel? Do you export your wine? Sell locally? Make a name for yourself via wine fairs? Buy off professional wine tasters with gifts of wine? The 12+ actions are never no-brainers, money remains tight throughout the game, and you never how your approach is going to fair in response to the weather conditions or particular tastes that year (e.g., if weather is bad, producing cheap wine may result in a whole batch that can't be sold to the general public; if the critics are looking for wines with a rich 'nose,' accordingly, you hope your wine delivers). As a heavy Euro, it works against the locked-in (baked in?) strategy by providing these types of (dis-)incentives which make it such that the typical hyper specialization approach (i.e., min-max) becomes a high-risk/high-reward proposition -- and accordingly, the game *may* reward a greater degree of flexible, adaptive approaches. Overall, incredibly clever, well designed and provides a rich thematic experience (even if it looks like a collection of typical Euro-tropes).

Big and complicated, a time sink and fiddly as hell. And that board... it's so full of visual clutter, it reminds me of a casino table or pinball machine. It piles on images and abstract encoded information in such a way as to confound and overwhelm the viewer. Not surprisingly, the game design reflects that. Way too much going on here.

Vinhos is a tight, tight game, and far more logical in play than the somewhat cumbersome rules and help guides suggest.

Rarely outside of a Wallace game will one find a Worker placement with so small a number of actions to garner points.

Order, choice, placement, funds, resources, some small amount of luck (in good or bad weather)- all have a part in the strategy and play, and there's not a lot of time to take advantage of them.

Six turns, 2 actions per turn, w/added penalties for getting there 2nd or later. Tight!

The game seemed somewhat impenetrable from reviews, but the many good player aids, plus the Designer's geeklist really help make this work pretty smoothly.

But playing it... well, I'll do better next time.

I'm starting this out at a 7.25- this is a very strong game, with lots of player challenges, and it seemed tight with only 3 players- I can only imagine what 4 players must be like. (Maybe next game...)

So far the most interesting vineyard game out there and offers a good feeling of growing crops and aging the wine. However, there is just too much cramped into this game (bank action and wine selling, I am talking to you) as to make it play smoothely. Thus I fear that it will not see much table time and will be turned down in favour of other, more elegant games.

I've definitely detected a trend towards Euros becoming more complex of late, this is yet another game that offers a bewildering array of choices. You'll need to play this three times just to get a handle on it. Once again this is a case (no pun intended) of turning a very limited number of actions into the maximum number of victory points. Perfectly competent, but I feel that Euros are heading up a design blind alley.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Yep, there  is indeed a lot going on here.  You have to worry about the weather, the quality of your wines, the cards you can pick up, and oh yeah, then there are the victory points, once you get to a point where you can think about those.  

The weather is very important and can be really rough; bad weather can really hurt a player who has specialized excessively. Another challenge is the way that the actions are laid out in a 9x9 square; since you can only move to adjacent squares (without paying, and money is VERY tight), it's important to know what you want to do next in addition to what you want to do this time.  Oh, and did I mention that money is tight?

In short, I like the arc of the game, though it's a bit long, and I like all the things that are there to be figured out, but it's pretty easy for a player who gets a slow start to be pushed out of the running.  (1 play)

Es un juego con muchísimos elementos para jugar en teoria durante un relativo corto espacio de tiempo que da la sensación de que el diseñador se ha empeñado en conseguir un juego más difícil de lo que en realidad necesita ser. De alguna manera, en el sistema, los árboles no te dejan ver el bosque porque está compuesto de una serie de submecánicas que son "minijuegos" (la feria, exportar, vender, los expertos) dentro de otro más grande (el Cuadrel de acciones)... como si el autor no hubera decidido qué ideas eran importantes y cuáles no. Buena mecánica la del Cuadrel (decides escoger una de 9 acciones dispuestas en el tablero en forma de cuadrado) y ejecutarla así como la Feria (el mejor minijuego de entre todos los que está compuesto) PROS: Un buen juego económico perteneciente al apartado de Eurgames pesados. CONS: Afecta mucho el A/P. Primeras partidas opacas. Muy mala relación tiempo invertido en la explicación/tiempo de juego.

This game needs an editor - too much complexity for complexity's sake.  Only played once, and at least half of our 4 1/2 hour session was spent either learning or trying to understand the rules.  Vinhos is in the weird position of having a deeply integrated theme, but so many convoluted and artificial gameplay elements that it completely takes you out of the game (can anyone argue with a straight face that the wine manager bonus move spaces are even remotely thematic? And don't even get me started on the wine fair...) Even after the game was done I still didn't have a clear understanding of how to play the game well.  I'm sure my rating would go up after playing again, and I would be willing to try it again, but it's not very high on my priorities list.

[b]2 Player Review:[/b]

I had always hear Vinhos is one of the most complex games out there. And while there are quite a few rules, I found I could remember each rule very quickly as they all just made sense, plus the iconology on the game board and player boards is excellent. Our very first game took a total of 1 hour and 13 minutes, well below the minimum suggested playing time. I had so much fun calculating the value of my wine each turn; what purpose my existing wine should go towards, and how to maneuver myself around the action area; that every moment of each turn was very satisfying and enjoyable. There is an incredibly low amount of downtime on such a complex beast of a game. Highly recommended, especially if you enjoy playing while drinking some wine, like we did. haha. 

[b]Pros:[/b]

- Very little downtime.
- Only takes a bit over an hour after learning the rules.
- Always something to think about between turns. 

[b]Cons:[/b]

- Starting setup doesn't have a huge amount of variety. 
- You might start to use very similar strategies after several plays.

after three plays, its beginning to come together. the thematic nature of all the decisions makes the rules more intuitive than they usually are in a game this complex. played with 4 people twice (long) and 2 people (comparatively breezy, though things bogged down when trying to calculate the best move at the end of the game - when you have four people making those decisions, you have more time to consider your move before you're up).

Vinhos has a substantial rules set which takes some time to digest. However, the game runs relatively smoothly in practice, in no small part thanks to the numerous icons on the board. The length of the game really depends on how long the players spend thinking - the end of the game, in particular, provides plenty of scope for analysing how to optimise your score. 

Vinhos is certainly a gamer's game. Numerous inter-linked processes provide many options, in both the short and long term, for gaining victory points. And yet, you have very few actions in which to accomplish your goals. Vinhos is also quite thematic. Both the presentation (artwork/components) and many of the game mechanics tie in with the theme, and I'm particularly glad to see that weather has a role to play. However, some of the mechanics have no obvious connection with the theme which, given the sheer number of elements to the game, makes Vinhos difficult to learn. I would even say that there are too many mechanics. For example, I find the reputation cubes fiddly and time-consuming given their relatively minor effect on the game. Another aspect which can be problematic for beginner's is that micro-management is important, particularly as money is so tight, and yet the game can be won or lost on a small number of key decisions. Up to 15 or 16 VPs can be available from an Export action or a Multiplier (with the 1 VP per Bagos Multiplier potentially being even more rewarding), and so a missed opportunity can be very costly.

RATING: 6
Wow!  Soooooo mechanical...  (and dry).
Artificially and unnecessarily complicated too.
All this complexity doesn't have any added value.  It feels rather like the designer wanted to include in the game anything he could think of whether it made sense or not.  Like he wanted to make an ultimate game on wine subject, but it didn't turn out to be the case.  Maybe you need more game-designing experience under your belt before you start creating 'ultimate' games..

Still - the gameplay is much simpler than the rules would suggest and it's overally solid design.  That's why it gets '6' from me.

Sold.

Initial rating one play

Finally got to play this, pretty thematic for a Euro game overall, and quite a heavy strategy game as you need to plan ahead to make good wines, and then ship and sell them for good money and points, and then also show them off for more points. Many things going on and to watch for, rules weren’t not as intensive as I expected from what I had heard prior, but we had a good teacher lay them out so that helped. It did run a little long like probably 3 hours but I enjoyed it enough to revisit it.

Money is artificially tight because of the (I assume purposely) awkward bank system, you get very few actions in the game so each one counts, and the board seems to be designed to always make the most interesting actions more expensive, so all this adds up to a well designed tight euro. But that said the game just didn't wow me, somehow I wanted something more. I think everything was just a bit too straightforward; it didn't feel particularly clever. Don't get me wrong though I liked the game and would certainly be glad to play it more, but I was just hoping for something a little more interesting. Maybe I'm just shallow for not being able to appreciate this game for what it is, a solid, tight game. And one that's surprisingly quick to play.

Update: Still feel basically the same, but I'd like to elaborate a bit after my most recent play. Overall I'd still say it's a solid game and a pretty tight game, but one that just sits outside of great for me because it feels like it lacks that special unique something. It's still very good, but I didn't see anything that really wowed me. There are a number of gamey aspects, but for me they're gamey in a way that makes the game more interesting and so I'd call that a positive. But I can see others being bothered by that. I think the weather tiles are interesting in that their randomness feels unpleasant (unfair?) in a game that's otherwise all about being very precise about planning, but probably they don't affect things too much to really be a problem, they just feel like they do.

I don't know, it certainly wasn't bad but there seemed to be a lot of reasons to keep checking the rules throughout the game, which was tedious.  Game flow wasn't smooth and it took awhile to get to the point where we weren't constantly looking something up.

Overly complex with mechanics that just don't fit the theme, I find myself prefering viticulture (with tuscany) purely because that game at least makes sense, even though I prefer heavier games.

The board may look intimidating at first, since there are several areas requiring your attention, but this is a great game that meshes the topic of wine with competitive play. After the first play, the tactical choices made become more intuitive and decisive, making play time go by quickly. It's quite immersive for a euro and an example of how good a board game can be. The art and component quality are excellent. The only reason I did not give it a 10 is that it felt 1-2 rounds too short!

Initial Rating: 8.5 (November 2011)

In my inner gamer self, I have always preferred to play heavy and complex games with low luck, and Vihnos meets those criteria. 

It is somewhat hard to teach as it has many rules, but the game flows very naturally and in my opinion is very well done. 

Have in mind I have only played it ONCE, but it appears that there is many ways to get VPs in the game and also there is a lot of strategies to explore. It has plenty of hard decisions and thus it maintains the tension during the game. While I don´t particularly like the theme, I can see why many of my friends like it so much. What I like is that from my point of view, the theme and mechanics are very well meshed and work perfectly together.

It has a rather long play time but as you are so immersed in the game you don´t feel it.

The ONE thing I didn´t like is that IMO you have too many barrels to invest, you can use and block some of the spots that give high VPs since the beginning of the game and it won´t hurt you a bit.

RATING: 9
Possibly the game of 2010 for heavy gamers who appreciate diverse paths to victory, special powers, and lots of indirect interaction.  The Quadrel action selection system is clearly inspired by the rondel games and yet has a character all its own as it requires some forward planning without enforcing a fixed sequence of actions.  It takes a few plays to learn how to build an effective engine out of all the various moving parts, and how to most effectively turn that engine into points through the myriad point-conversion mechanisms.  I suspect that among experienced players it will be imperative to compete for maximum fair points, as that is the only VP source that doesn’t use one of the fixed supply of barrels available to the player.  I’m not sure my strategy musings are to be taken seriously after only three plays however.

Vinhos shares some characteristics with the economic snowball genre in that the principal aim is to get an engine going in the early part of the game, and then convert that engine to points in the endgame.

After 8 plays I'm still enthusiastic about Vinhos and want to play again soon if I can.  There are two designer-suggested variants I will never again play without.  The first is reverse turn order purchase of the first vineyard.  I find that holds in check the opening where player 1 buys Setubal, gets the X-1 vineyard expert, and then buys tons of vineyards on turn 1.  Setubal is still powerful but not overpowered with the variant.  The second variant is a limit of 12 points from the cash scoring space.  I've found that unlimited points from this space led to degenerate strategies and this change balances the cash space better with others like full estates and wineries which are harder to score than cash but now have greater max potential.

Sadly, ended up trading this game before playing it. I did break it out for a practice play to teach myself the rules. While the game was a challenge to teach myself, I can manage it. Thinking of my game group, while I know that some could swallow it, even those folks would find it more convoluted than it is worth. It would be an interesting experience, but never see repeat plays, I fear.

I cannot consider it a better game because has a flavour of artifice, and the fair is at least strange. Anyway it is not an economic game. Too long for what it offers.

While I haven't played all of the 2010 Essen games, I have played a good many of them, and Vinhos is, IMHO, the best of them all.  Playing the game is a very intense, rewarding experience, for me it's alot like playing my all-time favorite, Die Macher.  But, like Die Macher, it's a complex game, quite a few rules and things to remember, but it all fits together in the end in a very worthwhile gaming experience.  It tends to run long, and note I have played only four games thus far, almost always with new players which makes the game even longer.  But I enjoy it quite a bit and am looking forward to playing it again.  There's enough random variables built into the game to assure that replayability is not going to be an issue, but the game is certainly not dominated by luck or random elements since there are so many meaningful decisions.  My experience suggests that the game offers multiple paths to victory and scoring points, such that it's not going (as some have suggested) to automatically go to whoever goes first and gets the most estates going on turn one.

Bumping the rating down a notch, to a 7.  Doesn't get as much play as two of Lacerda's more recent offerings (CO 2 and the Gallerist), both of which are a tad better.

RATING: 5
Too many elements for the relatively short play length. Seems like they tried too hard to make this more complex than it needs to be. I've played games with more depth than this with simpler rules. This is the antithesis of "elegant". Plus you have to sink in a huge amount of time for learning/teaching rules and set up. Hell, the game itself might be shorter than rules explanation!

edit: I like the game. The problem is the initial time investment cost to learn the rules. Teaching this game is a pain. Reading the rulebook is a pain. I would play it with people who already know the rules but would think twice if they're learning. Because of this high "initial time investment", the rating is reduced.

There is a good game in there but I think the author tried to put too many mechanic variations into the stew.  I also think the layout and mechanics could be streamlined and improved in order to improve overall game play.  Still enjoy it but boy it is a pain to teach.

Vinhos renders its theme with lofty ambition and incredible complexity. Players run up to four estates that produce red and white wines of varying quality, and because the game favors high-volume production, the early game is about getting three or four estates in place ASAP. From there players may develop these estates with additional vinyards, wineries, enologists, and cellars. These developments will boost the quality of of wine for the purpose of selling (for cash), exporting (for victory points) and presenting at fairs (also for VP), but they also serve to safeguard production in the event of bad weather during a season. Most of the developments also boost "renown" in the associated region, and this is a scarce resource that any player in the region may spend during a sale, export, or presentation action to boost the value of their wine. Players can also hire wine experts who will either help out with production varying ways or showcase the wine at fairs (boosting it's reputation). 

Wines presented at the fair can be used to establish relationships with three managers in the wine industry, each of whom is always looking for particular qualities in the wine. This part of the game is key, because players can give a wine away to the managers later in exchange for a bonus action up to once per regular action. Bonus actions are also by far the most difficult part of the game to get a handle on, since involve not only a tempo consideration (you can't activate the same bonus action without choosing a different one in the meantime) but also include all of the game's endgame scoring bonuses (points based largely on estate development; for example, 4 points per cellar). The markers used to claim endgame scoring and bonus actions (a player's "barrels") are subject to a hard limit, and it's going to be a classic new-player blunder to have barrels in the wrong places at the end of the game, with no way to retrieve them. What this amounts to is a profound anticlimax wherein players still have several excellent wines to sell, export, etc, but no barrel markers available to take those actions. Despite generally high dedication to theme, this part of Vinhos feels very "gamey," as players clearly have both the actions and the wines to keep playing, but the game says no. 

Vinhos also involves an interesting layer of money management. Wine sales go directly to a player's bank account, and players will have to go to the bank and withdraw that money to use it purchasing the developments mentioned above. Furthermore, players begin the game "invested" to a certain level, and may "divest" at any time for quick cash. The trade-off is that their bank-account then slowly depreciates at negative interest. Wine sales themselves have been the subject of much initial skepticism from the online community (as of December 2010), as players quickly clog up the available spaces with their barrels and then camp on those spaces to prevent other players from selling. The incentive to remove the barrels is interesting - increased renown for estates in the associated regions - but in practice there is a very blunt and dull blocking subgame that defines the sales environment. 

When it comes down to it, Vinhos is extremely complex but also sparse on actions, which is always a dubious combination. In four plays I've found myself admiring the game's integration of theme, but the general flow of the game is starting to wear on me. The first two rounds of the game are an elaborate setup phase to get 3-4 estates, and I don't find the implications to be that interesting. I also have to admit that I just don't like the game's bonus-action mechanic and barrel limit. The novelty has worn off, and now it seems automatic to have lots of estates and to always be looking for ways to discard wines to do extra stuff. The double-use (using wines not only within actions but to have access to the actions in the first place) rubs me the wrong way for some reason. 

At times, Vihnos feels like a marvelous machine with no power source. I'm not sure where the replayability is supposed to come from... indeed I'm close to feeling like I've seen most of what there is to see here.

Two weeks ago when learning Troyes I thought that it was complicated. But compared to Vinhos Troyes' rules were a breeze. Eurogames don't get much more complicated than that. This makes it difficult to judge Vinhos after one play. It promises to be a very good game but our first play was hampered by our lack of skills. The game ended with many scoring opportunities not used. 
On the other hand, the heavy rules overhead limits opportunities for repeated play a lot making it difficult to earn a fair return on investment. The wine fair must be one of the most confusing elements in modern Eurogames. Elegant this is not! I have the nagging feeling that a similar return can be earned from other games with less investment needed. A lot of the buzz on BGG might stem from the initial challenge to master a complex system. Complexity = depth? At least I'm willing to find out which speaks for the game.

While I'm not a wine enthusiast, I can see why people like the theme of the game.  I find the theme to be fairly novel (even if there was an unusual number of wine-themed games this year) and very well implemented.

The big problem with the game is the heavy load of rules that you have to learn upfront.  If you can learn the game by being taught, I think it would go very smoothly and it would be more enjoyable.  But as a game explainer, it is cumbersome.  It's like Agricola - I'm done teaching the game until it comes to someone like my kids when they get old enough.  I have little desire to teach Vinhos to any more people, and I've only taught 2!

That said, when considering the large amount of rules, the game does not feel clunky or cumbersome, even with so many different charts and pieces on the board.  I like how constrained you are in your actions, and I would imagine that once people gain a lot of experience with the game the play time could really go down, since you don't have that many actions to take.

I like the level of randomness and indirect interaction, and there seems to be room for many different potential strategies and tactics.  So if I can get over the hurdle of getting others to learn the game, it's an enjoyable experience.

Wow, pretty stunning game. The first thing I noticed is that the theme and mechanics are integrated very, very well. Given that it is a Eurogame, through-and-through, makes that surprising. Given that it is a very complicated Eurogame makes it all the more surprising.

There is a lot to keep track of in this game, and lots of places to score decent points. Juggling it all is the trick and knowing when and how to manage your wines is ultimately what this game is about.

Based on one play; four-player.  There's a lot going on in this game and it's tough to grasp it all in the first game.  Entertaining first play causing me to want to read the rules afterward and try it again now that I know how to play.  Would like to play again.  Won't buy it as the game is too complex to warrant buying it and not playing it for lack of opponents.

This game is nearly on Agricola-level. Astonishing fluent after a really hard introduction round. The only, very only, concern in comparison with Agricola, is the replay value. Maybe you are not able to get over 50+ plays out of Vinhos, until this game loses some of its flavour. But I'm not there yet, of course. On the other hand, it's a little bit more forgiving. If you don't calculate your early rounds very strictly in Agricola, you're lost and you'll lose badly. In Vinhos you'll have more fun, even if you made some mistakes.

I really love it.

Update:
Introduced it again and it went way better. If you already know the game, it quite easy to explain. Takes 30 minutes and everyone is quite clear about the options.

RATING: 8.5
Keeping with the game’s theme, I would certainly call this one “full bodied.” There is a lot going on in this game. Unlike many games (even the more complex ones) it will take quite some time to go through the rules and typically a play or two for players to start to get a grasp of what to do. Despite the seemingly short 6 years of play (w/ 2 actions per year) the ability to trigger additional actions using Managers really gives each player closer to 20+ different actions plus several additional actions during the end game. 

Gathering points at the three wine fairs is certainly important, but not crucial to place at the top in each. Manager multipliers can be equally (or sometimes more) effective for gathering points during the game. In my limited plays, quantity does seem to trump quality in most situations. A poor production year early in the game can put some pressure on a high quantity/ low quality estate, but in most cases, it can be overcome and lead to a strong finish. Liquidity can be an issue, especially when the sales spots start filling up, so players need to focus on this early on. 

Two potential concerns I have are (a) turn order advantage and (2) too many options for AP players. I have not played enough to know how much of a real problem these two things are yet, but I hope they can be managed to the extent needed. 

Although the board and rules can be quite intimidating, I think they are well written and most of the icons become clear after one play.

Vinhos proves that lots (and lots and lots) of simple mechanisms don't equal a deep or good game. 

The whole game just feels like a bland mishmash of different mechanisms. Excitement, turn angst or player interaction are nowhere to be found.

Of all the over 1000 games I've played, Vinhos easily has the worst ratio of time spent on explaining rules and actually playing the game: it took a bit under 1h to teach the rules and 2h (with four fast players) to play the game. That's almost 1/3 time spent on rules.

03-14-2014 - After 2 plays so far, I like it quite a bit, but I don't love it.  The individual actions aren't too difficult, but putting it all together is a bit complex.  It is definitely a "you can't do everything you want to do" kind of game and it's a bit frustrating.  But, it's a nice brain-burner and I'm glad we own it.  Perhaps my rating will go up, especially with more than two players.  We'll see!  7.5 for now.

This game is 'Fresco's' and 'Gates of Loyang's' love child. 

Vinhos = Once you get some training in how to play it, and train some others that won't facemelt when you open the box, it is immensely satisfying. The type of satisfying like throwing a mars lander through space and landing something the size of a mini cooper on the 4th planet, only with wine references. New gamers will run from Vinhos like it is the freaking zombie apocalypse. And I'm fine with that.


A heavier worker placement game with an economic engine under the hood.


The fair is a mini game in itself. 

It is better to play once as a speed round to teach new players the rondell. There will be something you get wrong on how to play the first couple of times.   Deal with it. 

===============================================

The complicated thing to teach new people is the importance of the extra actions, and knowing you can't just pump out cheap ernest and julio all the time. 

The Rule book is byzantine as hell. 

2 Players:  Solid gameplay looking to make up own rule for placement, such as variant of 1st and 3rd stand, unless you are within the difference of vitory points awarded for 1st and 2nd place of that year.   Keep close victories close.  And prevent sandbaggers in 2nd from getting any points.

3 Players: optimal gameplay. 

4 Players:  Crowded and lots of downtime with people trying to maximise their 12+n moves from hooking up managers with cheapo wine. 

Upped it to a 9 after another play, I just keep finding out more and more about the game I like.

RATING: 5.8
Great attention to detail. A well-tested, thematic eurogame - that is too complex (convoluted) for its own good; it's just simply not as interesting (nor as innovative) as complex. Do I really need to wait 10 minutes between turns? Even the official game duration time says I do. I want to play a 10-minute filler meanwhile. Playing Vinhos is a strange experience as you really can see all the care that is put in the game and you can see its engine works perfectly - but whatever perfection it reaches, it's simply not FUN.
It's a game. I expect games to be FUN. A light game can be fun. A complex game can be fun. Vinhos isn't fun. I admire its perfection but I don't really enjoy it.

It feels like Vinhos has just the same problems as filmmakers when they make their first movie. When you are a first-timer you can't be sure there will be another one so you want to put in everything. A good editor can cut it back though - Vinhos feels like it had no editor. Note to the designer: less is almost always more. If the game was 90% this good with 50% of the rules complexity then that game was better than this one. Use additional complexity only if it significantly increases the greatness of the game. Or think of the motto of the greatest Euro designers: a game is not ready when there is nothing to add to the rules - but when there is nothing to take away.

That game makes my head spin but I deeply enjoy it for reasons I haven't completely identified.  There's a *lot* going on and your first game will be a confused study in chaos.  The theme is pervasive and very nice, yet the mechanics are quite abstract.  It's a very unique game that's hard to compare to anything else.  You make wine, sell it, present it in competitions, etc, but all through intricate and deeply intertwined mechanics.  There's tons of player agency and a good mix of tactics and strategy.  It's a game any serious boardgamer should experience at least once.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Money is hard to come by - and due to limitations on your actions, you really need to be very efficient with your money, actions, and the strategy one pursues. This is a typical What's Your Game production in that there is MANY moving parts which makes a relatively simple game quite complex. I really dislike teaching most What's Your Game games due to this.  Production levels are top notch.

This is a phenomenal game. I'd put this right alongside such games as [GAMEID=1], [GAMEID=9215], [GAMEID=18602] and [GAMEID=421] for sheer force of gameplay. The initial dissemination of any real strategy is rather opaque but this is not a bad thing; this game takes time to unfold all the various nuances and paths to victory. This is one of those games that really takes study in order for players to realize its full potential. I've played five 4-player games and I think that I'm just starting to understand what's going on.

As a study in game design this is a stunner and even more so in that it is Vital Lacerda's FIRST entry into the hobby (I'm speechless). I eagerly anticipate his next offerings [GAMEID=72225] and [GAMEID=109276] and I'm ready to dip into my wallet sight unseen; I don't offer this praise lightly or often to any designers.

UPDATE (July 2012): Had a chance to play this as a 2-player game with my wife 3 times and this game seems to me to pretty much perfectly scale. You remove 2 vinyards and a certain number of cellars available so this limits the game. We've also been using the Fair Score VP variant (1st gets 1st while 2nd gets 3rd) and this really seems to drive up some necessary competition for the Fair that wasn't there without this variant.

Such a great game and it takes a little over an hour to complete for 2 players and about 90 minutes for 4. I'm eager to try this out as a 3-player game as well to see how it does. Here's hoping cause this is one heck of a game.

This game is CONVOLUTED. It's as though they created the game and then tried to find ways to make things more difficult, primarily by adding more steps to very simple goals. That means there are more rules governing play and more times you'll be referencing the rules to ensure you're playing right. 

I'm not sure I want to play this again. I already own Pret A Porter which does something similar without all the chaff. It also plays faster (not incredibly so), so I think Vinhos is on it's way out.

Vital Lacerda's first great game.  A worker placement game where you are building a vineyard and turning in wines to get additional actions from wine critics.  At the end a number of turns, there is a Wine Fair where you compete to satisfy the tastes of various critics.  

This game is heavy, not Kanban heavy, but heavy.  It is hard to teach and not an easy game to learn.  But it is worth the investment if you like heavy Euros.

The core mechanism of the game is a worker placement  game fest; you always have to think about the best  action space- given the circumstances -for your worker and your 8 barrels. 
You always have to adapt your plans and in the same time you try to prevent other players to fulfill their goals.
In the first half of the game you try to establish a and optimise your wine producing engine.
The last half, you pay attention at conversing your wine and barrels  in victory points in the best possible way.
You have many variables ; you go for lots of cheap wines ? a couple of expensive wines ? game experts, game managers, oenologist, wine fair subgame or export ? you are always in desperate need of money...
The game balance is very good ; in most games, there is a narrow margin between the first and last place.
Strong tactical  tactical play is needed (renown cubes !squadrel)but there is also room for strategical approach (wineyards, export versus the fair).The endgame shuffling of the barrels is also of great importance.

It's a very original and thematic worker placement game; a little less variation and less deep than agricola. For me on the same level as age of empires III. 

The rules are more difficult than the game system.
Very well explained game rules
The small weaknesses of the game are the somewhat restricted variability and the learning curve which is a bit high (not really a disadvantage)

This game has a lot going on, but it all fits together well.  In my first game it was hard to keep track of all the rules and possibilities.  The second game played much more easily and was enjoyable for it.  Still, I feel like I've just scratched the surface here; there's a lot more to this game than we've discovered so far.

Make wine, get points. A pure euro about planning your actions based on a 9x9 grid and getting there before your opponents. Simple mechanics, but ALOT going on. You only get 2 actions a round, so you need to make them count. Shares a lot of similarities with viticulture. plays 2-4 players, best with 4, good with 3. Plays in about 2 hours.

A great Euro!

It takes time to fully grasp the rules and the opportunities how to prepare and finally execute for high scoring, but these are fully intuitive and well to comprehend. Player Aid recommended for correct usage of wine experts.

It´s a nice and attentive game to be played by 2, competitive but still straightforward by 3 and highly brutal by 4 players. Competitiveness excels by the game mechanic to always being able to interfere, but never to inhibit somebody´s move. Nasty and meany, not destructive - I like that! :-)

Downtime during other player turns could be used to plan your own next move.

1st edition is heavy eurogame and not for everyone. Great for the heavy games collector who like the 1st edition graphic design. 

2nd edition (Deluxe edition) has an revised and easier version of the 1st edition rules, which makes the game medium heavy and a bit easier to teach (though still complex).

En cinco partidas, se ha convertido en uno de mis juegos favoritos. 

Aunque hay gente que lo encuentra sin tema, yo soy muy contrario a esa opinión. Es un euro duro, difícil de explicar pero muy intuitivo a partir de la segunda partida, precisamente porque el tema cohesiona muy bien las mecánicas que están muy bien engranadas.

Mucha gente critica también la feria; mi opinión es que, aunque como bien dicen, no sirve para ganar la partida, es una parte del juego que debes optimizar para obtener acciones extra y, si es posible, algunos puntos de victoria.

Excellent economic Euro.  Passed on it the first time, but a play of James's copy convinced me to trade for it.  It has become a favorite go-to game for two, even though we have to refresh ourselves each and every time as to how to play!  Once you get going it all begins to make sense again.  The one thing I am not fiond of is the fact your expert friends are satisfied with any old crap wine you give to them: I should say they would have standards, and you should have to send something better quality if you want to achieve their favor, but it is a minor point I suppose.

*Dec 2012* Thinking of selling this. Dungeon Petz may have replaced it, though I've only played half a game of this and none of DP. Seem similar to me..... We'll see. Theme of this game is more appealing to myself and the wife but you never know what happens after a few plays of each. 

*Jan 2013* After what felt like a very dull second game, I'm selling this. It's a well made game and I'm pretty sure it felt so dull due to my partner being a complete newb to gaming and I didn't feel the overwhelming urge to nab as many points as I can. While I'm pretty sure this is a fantastic game, I own enough others and this one has a lower priority for tablespace so it's gone.

Lots of balls juggling, but appears to be decent paths to victory.  Despite the plethora of different items on the board, becomes fairly intuitive after the first play.  Not sure how a 2 player would work well, but 3 and 4 player is a good time.

Very nice mesh of mechanics and theme for a Euro.  Everything fits and is pretty intuitive.

This is probably the most rule heavy game I ever played. I like a lot of the mechanics, especially the bank. For some reason the wine fair doesn't click with me, it makes no sense rules wise. I always have to check the rules, because I keep missing little thing. In my opinion this game is too heavy. Not on strategy, but on rules and complexity alone. Because of that I hardly ever want to play it and it not friendly to introduce to new players. I will sell this before it gathers dust on my shelf. Lot's to love about this game though, but in the end not for me. I am definitely checking some more of Vital's games, there must be one out there for me!

This is a meaty game. The first play really is just an introduction to all the interlocking parts of the game.

It is not really hard, but there is a lot to do and when to do it, is the problem, but I have the feeling there always is something to do to get you farther. Money is really really tight.

There is a lot going on and it is hard to define a strategy. It makes it hard to get to the table for me.

Overly complicated then it needs to be.  Feels like mechanics were thrown in just because the designer wanted them in there.  The wine fair is counter intuitive.  Using your best wine only allows you to send more exports, doesn't effect your placing in the fair otherwise.  Your experts aparently die after pimping your wine at the fair too.  Bribing the managers doesn't make sense.  You bribe them with your cheapest wine.  What are they winos?  Selling your wine puts the money into your bank account instead of in your wallet.  Exporting your wine to foreign markets doesn't give you any money at all.

I love deep games with tight money and tough choices, this one just doesn't click for me.

After playing this, I can pretty much conclude that Lacerda's games aren't for me. I definitely see why people like them. There's a certain level of thought required that you don't see in other games, but to me it just isn't that fun. Vinhos, in particular, has some really interesting mechanisms that come together well. It just isn't as engaging as other designs.

Would rather play Viticulture.

An extremely solid system. The rules are indeed overwhelming, but quite intuitive that with multiple-plays it makes sense. Still, the first game or two you'd make a lot of bad decisions because you miss a rule or two. 

There are a lot of decisions to be made, and the good thing is wrong decisions aren't disastrous. While you technically perform only 12 actions, the bonus actions and each sub-actions could make a single turn last for quite a bit. 

This is a true brainburner that rewards skillful play, however very long (even among experienced players, 4P game can takes 3 hours) and the entrance threshold is very high. You need dedicated players AND those that are capable to perform handle complicated system (without AP!!) to play the game, which can be hard to come by. 

Other thing is while this is an excellent game, for the same enjoyment you could perhaps play a game that is less deep or less time-consuming.

Blimey, this is a tough one. So much going one, multiple routes, fab!

Rating after 3 plays, so we're still learning. I suspect the rating will increase as we get more to grips with it.

Initial plays feel a bit like University Challenge, it's so taxing on the brain!!  Your whole strategy can be ruined by a couple of early poor years of weather, but then everyone is in the same boat.

EDIT - it's getting easier and my rating is getting higher!  Up there with my favourites.

Despite finishing a distant 4th, I loved nearly every minute of this game. There's a lot going on, but it all blends together beautifully. I hope I can find a few players that enjoy this as much as I do, as I think it's the type of game that will hold up over many plays and show a lot of different strategic possibilities as the mechansims and their interplay is better understood.

RATING: 7
[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  At first glance, the board is a cluttered mess. Once you learn the rules, the board is very efficient at getting across information. I think it's one of the things that keeps this game from being over the top in complication. A lot of the small rules that you need to remember (like cost of goods or placing down cubes) are told to you through iconography, so you aren't likely to forget these rules if you're paying attention.

[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  Like with pretty much any heavy euro, you have a lot of paths you can go down for victory. You can sell wine, export wine, present the wine to the judges, purchase scientists and buildings to make your wine even better, hire experts that can either give you a beneficial action or increase the value of your wine at the judgement. 

You can use cubes to increase the value of your wine pretty much anywhere you go, but you're limited on the amount of cubes that are available to you, so you must use them wisely. Even beyond that, there are three judges that you can impress, and each one gives different benefits that may interest you, so you may specifically attempt to impress Constantino by buying a vineyard from a region who's benefit you don't care for, so that you can use he unique benefit of scoring for wineries. 


[b][COLOR=#66CC33]Pro:[/COLOR][/b]  I can’t determine if the length in this game is a positive or negative factor. The bad factor of this game is that the length forces you to pick  a very specific path to victory. If you had a few more turns, you’d be able to implement a few more of the many different mechanics to get you points. But without those turns, you won’t have enough actions to export wine and sell wine and present wine to the judges and buy a lot of vineyards and make sure you don’t run out of money.

Though, I think the good thing about the length is that you can work around that, and as heavy as the game is, it’s over quickly. Most heavy games drag on for so long, but this one doesn’t. Because of this, I guess I will determine this a positive quality.


[b][COLOR=#FF0033]Con:[/COLOR][/b] I don't mind complexity in Eurogames, in fact, I invite it. I think complexity removes the restrictions off of a designer and allows them to make games that offer countless decisions. I'm even eyeing some of Lacerda's other games like Lisboa and the Gallerist because he's always tackling unique themes, which is something I admire.

With that said, this games complexity is a negative factor.

There are way too many things going on, and it kills the flow of the game. Compared to something like Trajan, which, while not as complex, feels like everything flows together and works perfectly as a single machine, Vinhos utterly fails to make things feel like a unit. I think this is partially because of specific rules that should've just been scrapped. 

The bank shouldn't exist, and doesn't exist in the Deluxe version, which I think is really telling for how necessary it is in this game. The turn tracker shouldn't exist, I think it's just a tacked on mechanic that doesn't fit the theme at all, forces decisions that really shouldn't be forced, and makes the economy in an already harsh game even harsher. While on the subject of taking actions, I don't think you should be forced to pay other players for using their space or pay the bank for not moving to an adjacent space. 

[b][COLOR=#FF0033]Con:[/COLOR][/b] This game's main philosophy is quantity over quality. Not just with the ton of mechanics, but also with the overall strategy. Making a bunch of shit wine is honestly better than making a little bit of refined wine. This is primarily because bad wine will still impress 2 judges as long as the color and region match, which isn't that difficult to achieve. Then you donate wine to take extra actions from said judges. If you only have one really good wine, it's a really big sacrifice. But lots of bad wine can be donated without a second thought. There is an expansion that puts experts in games that let you move the barrel without donating wine, which helps that quantity over quality strategy with this game, but this rating I've given doesn't consider them.

[i][COLOR=#33CCFF]Final thoughts:[/COLOR]   Despite the fact that I think this game is more complicated than it needs to be, I actually like it. I originally rated this game a 4 because I disliked the harsh economy and the fact that you couldn’t really experience many different paths to victory. I also had a huge problem with the fact that the only 2 plays I had were played with first timers, so I had to spend an eternity teaching them and setting the game up, just the have the game itself not last as long. But my third play was with someone familiar with the game, and it actually felt quite a bit nicer.                [/i]

4 —> 7: I still think the designer tacked on mechanics for no reason, but the games length actually is something to admire now that I play the game again. A heavy Euro that can be over very quickly is actually kinda unique, and I think it’s worth bumping up for that reason, and for the fact that I enjoyed it quite a bit more on my most recent play.

You mined tin in Cornwall, painted the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel, so why not produce wine in Portuguese vineyards now?!
Because, to be honest, it is about the 1001st heavily structured euro with a boring pasted-on theme rammed down our throats that offers the same old clichéd cube-pushing yawn-fest for 4 hours (including a 1-hour rules explanation) as its predecessors.

It's a good game, but honestly a bit "too much" for me to want to own. I don't know enough people who would want to learn to play this. But I enjoyed playing it. The "mini-games" of the wine fair and the bank work well, and the wine fair keeps things tense. There are a lot of available options on any given turn, and this can be a very long game (our 4-player play took 4 hours, with some teaching involved). I prefer the artwork of the non-deluxe version.

I'd rather play Viticulture. :)

Played twice - once with two players, once with three players.

Worker placement game that is very thematic - you build up your production of wine and quality of wine, then you try to present the best product at the annual wine fair.

Heavier game which takes quite some effort to learn (unless you have a teacher).

Sold because of the 5 different people that played it, only one liked it, the rest thought it was kind of dull.  In particular, there wasn't a great deal of player interaction. Even as a worker placement game, you couldn't block placements, only make them more expensive for your opponents.  The real interaction was the Wine Fair phase, which is essentially a blind auction.

Good game, but as a heavier game it pales in its level of excitement in comparison to the other heavy games I like:  Age of Steam, Asgard, Brass, Madeira, Revolution: the Dutch Revolt.

Some very good ideas in here, but also some aspects that are far too underdeveloped:

- The wine fair is overcomplicated and counterintuitive. The quality of the wine you send has NOTHING to do with its initial fair value, which makes no sense. Here's what you do. Take a wine of value X. Add modifiers to it as you can depending on your estate and any renown from the region it's in to get Y. Look that value up on a chart. Depending on the value, you will get to place a chit worth 0 through 4 into the fair. What does that value mean? It's how many tiles you'll get to bid with later to add +3 per tile to the wine's value. The initial value of the wine depends only on which space you put your tile onto, where two of four colour values (which randomly increase during the game) tell you if it's +3, +7 or whatever. Way too fiddly, this is everything the Eurohaters hate about Euros.

- Some wine experts are crazy good early, some are crazy good late. Depending on which tiles are on top at the start, there may be a significant start player advantage (I'm thinking especially of the tile that lets you get all your vineyards for 1 less, which is a huge boon to your cash early).

- The rules about when you can remove barrels from sales are odd and artificially constraining.

- At 4 hours, the 4p game I played was way too long. Some of that was AP, some of that is that the game promotes AP by giving you more and more options as you progress without giving you much indication whether what you're doing is right. This would be a great 2 hour game, at 3 hours (with experienced players this is doable) it's too much.

Had a savvy editor ripped about a third of the extra chrome and junk out of this (keeping the tight cash, the fight for turn order and the interesting spatial elements surrounding action choices, for example), then this would have the potential to be an all time great. As it is, I suspect it will be largely ignored in a year's time, much like Vasco da Gama (another overcomplicated title) before it.

There's 9 possible actions, and you'll be taking 2 each turn for 6 rounds, to buy vineyards, wineries and meeples and place them all onto your player board to produce wines each turn, aiming for either lots of ok scoring wines or maybe an investment-loaded-up estate or two which will develop high scoring wines. And then spend later actions to sell them to raise money (to re-invest in vineyards, etc), or export them for victory points or use them in the fair competition for other victory points. On top of that, you can aim to lock in the spots that allow victory points for each type of investment you've made as well. There's so many ways to get victory points, the game is one of choosing / developing a strategy that others aren't concentrating on, and then doing it efficiently. There's a number of bonus actions that you can acquire that makes the game a whole lot more than your basic 9 actions, allowing for quite complex turns. The game therefore provides a lot of strategies to explore, keeps you engaged throughout, provides lots of races along the way to compete for (the only real interaction), and neat ways to get out of jams (such as money shortage). The rules are long at 45 mins or so, but found the game length at 2-2.5 hours is fine, and have found the decision making interesting and rewarding, so it's a keeper for now.

Lacerda is master of too many mechanisms. Opposite of elegant. Some rules here are very fiddly and hard to remember. Ie: dont forget you can do 'whatever' in phase two, subset b, but never anytime else. Why? Very non intuitive.  Played this once but don't really see much replay value.  It's much too complex to get most people interested.  If you're a fan of complex euros and you love the wine theme, then it might work for you.  Another thing I don't like about the Lacerda is his obsession with redoing all his previous games and then charging $100 more. I will not support EGG.  In this case, the ks game came out worse: inferior art, simplified gameplay. What's next?  He discovers he doesn't like some rule in Co2, reboots it with EGG chrome parts for $100 more? Oh, wait....Seriously, the discussions where dingbats praise his pimped out games from EGG ("ooo....look at the thick cardboard and huge box!) like this has anything to do with 'gaming' make me physically ill.  This emperor has no clothes.

After playing it a fourth time I finally think I can rate this game.
It is complex with alots of different special rulas, but nested into a fresh theme. So it doesn't feel fiddly but everything just makes sense. Very good. Still the gaming time is rather long so I lower the vote by 1. Still a solid 8.

A lot of intricacies to get to know on the first play, so do not expect to have a smooth game at first (nor a short one), but there is a lot of potential here. The game looks great and you need to not only produce high quality wine, but manage your actions and your bonus actions. Player order is also important and can be somewhat controlled. Well worth playing several times.

The antithesis of elegant. The game tries to attain depth by throwing a lot of unnecessarily obtuse mechanics at players, but it just makes the game ridiculous instead of deep. There are too many steps to do simple things, too many nonsensical rules whose only contribution is to make things more complicated, not more fun. I'm a huge fan of Brass, Madeira, and Agricola, so I have no problem with complex games when the complexity makes sense and serves a purpose. But adding in complexity just for the sake of complexity leaves this just another soulless collection of empty mechanics shoehorned together into an ill-fitting box. I eagerly traded this away after four plays. Not a fan of they designer. Happy to never play another of his games.

Heavy weight game with a wine making theme.  Uses worker placement mechanics.

RATING: 7
Yep, there's definitely a lot going on in this game.  You need to acquire vineyards that produce different types of wine, and then get wineries, wine experts, wine cellars, etc., to help improve that wine.  Meanwhile, you have to submit your wines to the fair, have enough wine to bribe the judges, deal with the weather, and have enough cash flow to deal with all of the above.  There are a ton of balances in this game, such as quality vs. quantity of wine, submitting wine early vs. late, and cash flow vs. victory points.  It definitely is a heavy game, but everything fits together well, so if you're up for it, it's a good experience.  And don't worry--the game gets MUCH easier the second time around.

Playtime: ~30-45 minutes per player

Comment: Highly thematic and a bit fiddly. This game is really starting to shine with more and more plays of it. Rather hard game to do well in and I'm not sure what depth this game has, but it does have you make some tough decisions each turn. My only complaint about the components is the stupid little round cardboard pieces for the wine fair. I feel like I could lose those if I sneezed too hard. Game length isn't as bad as I originally thought. Could be played in under 90 minutes with 2 players and obtainable within 60 minutes if you know what you're doing.

Optimal Player Count: 4 > 3 > 2

Plays well with all player counts.

That's a [b]heavy[/b] economy eurogame. Players take actions, building their vineyards and using their wine for various purposes. This game is unique; on the one hand, each turn is very simple: move your action marker and take the action, but on the other hand, the consequences of each action are really complicated. Players have only 12 precious actions in the whole game, so there will be a lot of brainstorming - and possibly AP - to best utilize these actions. Since you're paying to use actions where other players are present, it's super important to check what your opponents are doing and anticipate their moves, since there will be a race for these limited actions, like who gets to sell or export first. At the end, it leaves you with a sense of accomplishment, as you've got your vineyards up and running!

It seems like Vital threw all his favorite games into a pan and added some wine for flavor. The result is great: a heavy and complex game with a lot of very different ways  to score points that still feels coherent and thematic.

Works great with 2 players and is very cutthroat with 4!

The first play is really just figuring out the system. I was concerned that the "tasting fair" dictated everything, and while it can be important, it's not the only path.  In my three plays, in fact, the game seems to reward balance.  (That, and getting barrels among the wine tasters.) There are multiple ways to win, and, as with most strategic games like this, it speeds up with more plays as one's decision tree gets more streamlined.  That said, several decisions have to be made based on what your fellow players do because of how tight money is.

It's not intuitive, but after a play or two some general strategies are apparent, which make for a more rewarding experience. It's fun to learn this game's system while simultaneously achieving better results each time.

Looks like a pub fruit machine.  For some reason this game has the most daunting looking rules - a proper hurdle to get over before your first play.  Once you start playing though, you realise that actually the rules are more like sub-rules for each action type - some of them are almost mini-games in themselves.

Extremely well themed game.  In fact, it is probably the best euro i've seen to tie the mechanics into the theme.

The gameplay is meaty and I like how there are many strategies and routes to victory.

This is almost a good game,  but ultimately gets in it's own way, with lots of severe player blocking mechanics and a high level of over-complication. Between all the different action areas, it seems like it doesn't know what sort of game it wants to be. If the game didn't have the market phase, or if that phase was much much simpler, this could be a really solid game.

Horrible experience. Game takes way too long for return on time investment. Would much prefer to play dozens of other games in half the time. Too fiddly. Takes too long to calculate all the possibilities. Plus, the author has a lot of gall to insult our intelligence by denying that he made a fundamental error and gave the guy selling first a huge advantage over the other players. Something that is determined by pure chance (who gets the advantage is determined by random player order). This game is too structured. You are forced into a particular course of action based on your seat position. If you do not play to the seating order you will lose. I do not like being told how to play a game based on the turn order I started in. Give me some choices! I like to play games not have the games play me. The only good thing about this game is the production value and the theme, which is quite good. But length of time and seating advantage killed it for me. Will not play again.

Oh, almost forgot! Stupid arbitrary tie breakers. Kin wins the second game based on a second tie breaker condition, how far he was on the money track (one dollar ahead of Alan). Almost 4 hours of misery, pushing cubes around and waiting 20 minutes or more between turns so the game can be decided on a stupid tie breaker? And you want to know if I will play again?

Our 3-player group found it tough going to sort out all the rules in 2 separate evenings of play.  However, our second go at this game was successful in showing it is a very good game.

There is a lot to get into, but it is worth it.  Allow at least 2 plays of this game to get on top of all the rules, unless you have someone good at explaining everything for the first play.  Plan on taking 3 or 4 hours to play the game for the first 2 or 3 games because of the multiple choices available for every player action.

The bottom line is that it is an excellent multiple choice economic strategy game.

Unfortunately, I have very mixed feelings about this game.

On the one hand, I think the actual amount of things you can do is great. You can export wine, sell wine, work to have money in the bank, present wines at a wine fair, collect wine scientists, collect wine experts, ect. And all of those things can potentially give you victory points.

I love the idea of area control on the center board and on the export part of the board. 

I think the rulebook does a good job of explaining certain things. Like, it explains why one region doesn't allow you to have cellars, or why one regions vineyard produces better quality wine if you present it at the fair.

Now, the issues I have with it... This game really isn't thematic. Wine experts increase the value of your wine at the wine fair depending on which attribute they're experts on, and that's somewhat thematic because maybe they convince the judges that your wine is actually really good. But instead of using them at the wine fair you can flip them over and use actions with them. Like, you can receive 2,000 (or 1,000, I can't recall) bagos for turning a wine expert over, or you can shuffle vineyards in a specific region. Maybe the rule book explained that, too. But it's just silly.

Second issue, I mentioned earlier that this game has a lot to it, which is awesome. Good luck trying to experience it all. You get 12 default actions, and this includes trying to get money from the bank. It's apparent they found the bank wasn't the greatest idea because they rereleased this game and replaced the bank with another tile (I think it's for buying vineyards). I'm actually somewhat interested in playing this version of the game, because the bank always felt like an unnecessary part of the game. But to top it all off, this game is really tight on money, and you have to pay other players if you want to play an action that their piece is still on, or if you want to play an action that the round tracker is still on, or if you want to go to an action that isn't adjacent to your space. So you need to make sure you have enough money to dump into other people's pockets, on top of having enough money to do the action you want to do. These things heavily limit what you want to do. I'll admit, I played like shit and would love to have another chance to see if I could do better next time, but the fact that this game put me into a position where I really couldn't take an action at all is pretty bad, especially considering how much I wanted to experience this game.

Third issue, rule explanation is heavy.  I mean, ridiculously heavy. There's so many small points that you have to go over and since this game really doesn't work with the theme, it's not like the people you're teaching can really connect it to reality, which is what makes learning games easier for many people. I understood the rules, I knew this rulebook front to back because I was so excited to play the game and wanted to make sure I explained it to the best of my ability. I did "practice teachings" by myself in order to prepare, and it's still a mouthful of rules that just end up making this game feel much heavier than it needs to be, and I'm honestly a fan of heavy games so it's not like I'm really out of my element with it, and all of this wouldn't be that bad except for the fact that, again, there's by default 12 actions and for new players you probably won't be prepared enough to take a lot of bonus actions. So it takes longer to explain and set up this game than it does to play it.

WIth all of this said, I don't think it's a bad game. In fact, I think there's a lot of fun in it. Take what I said with a grain of salt, I've played it once and after looking at strategies online I've seen that the way I played was pretty awful. I just want to give my first impressions of a game that I was really looking forward to playing, just to be stuck having no way to do any actions and just feeling drained from explaining the rules alone.

Heavy Euro.  Not sure if it will suffer from the 'maximise-effective-moves-or-lose-horribly' and 'scripted-opening-turns' gremlins that can suck fun from an area pretty darn quickly.  Having said that, there are some things that make this game really appealing.  Strong theme with above average game play integration.  Unique and innovative approach to managing your personal finances.  Different paths to victory.  Think I'll like it.

Box is a bit crushed and it's missing one vineyard tile (which can be proxied easily enough, but it is annoying).

A lot going on here -- from building vineyards and wineries, to hiring enologists, and managing your cash on hand (as well as your investments, i.e. income). Each region in which you build your estates provides benefits, and where you ship your wine (selling it, gifting it as a bribe, etc.) can provide long term (VP) benefits or immediate benefits. There are wine fairs where you present your wines for points, as well as an element of role selection, and much much more. The rules are dense but not as poorly written as I originally thought. Wine ages from year to year, as in Grand Cru, but there is no direct bidding element. Lots of rules to remember. A "gamer's game."

Vinhos epitomizes an elegant, heavy game.

--Jul2012-- There's a lot of mechanisms here.  Possibly too many for the limitations of my meager intellect.  I played very badly - though still found it quite charmingly thematic and interesting.  I'd hope that a subsequent play (where I'm mostly clear on all the rules) would be a bit cleaner than my first time out.
--Dec2017-- And yet, in retrospect, I don't really want to give it another shot.  My memory has lost the "oh this was charming" sense, and retained the "there was a lot of busywork and seemingly superfluous mechanisms that we occasionally failed to remember."  While I could be leading myself astray, I think I'll not be unhappy to avoid it.

As brain-burny as advertised. So many options to think through on any turn. Money is a lot tighter than I thought at first. Also, you really only get 12 actions per game, so basically, you have to get pretty creative with how you spend your resources to get what you want.

久仰vinhos大名，果然"名不虚传"。
游戏信息量极大，教学很麻烦，受教者听起来也云里雾里。但实际上游戏流程却非常简单。尽管如此，我还是在游戏玩到第三回合时才搞明白是怎么回事，然后果断掀桌。。。
此外，游戏的代入感很强，主题跟机制联系很紧密，看着这点上我应该会尝试第二次。
I have heard the "big name" of vinhos for a long time, and it is really what he has bee told.
The information of game is humorous which makes teaching and learning very hard. But the process is very simple. In spite of that I understand what's going on after 3rd round and then we kick off the table without hesitation...
The theme of the game is very strong , so I think I will try it again in the near future.

A few years ago I would have definitively love this game, but now it just feels that a "je ne sais quoi" is missing. Probably it is that it feels like different games, some of them with very nice ideas, grouped together without having too much in common. The action selection mechanic is clever and original, the banking part is nice, the manager section feels a little weird and unintuitive, and the exhibition and the aging part feel in many ways like [i]Dungeon Petz[/i]. The rest just seems like something that you have sawn before in way too many other games. The low rating is maybe because I was very tired for a game as hard as this to learn the night that I played, but I'm sure it will improve if played in other circumstances.

Vinhos is a lovingly crafted masterpiece. It is the best action-selection board game that I own. Given how much of a brain burner this is, learning how to play is surprisingly easy due to the well-written rule book and the intuitive integration of mechanics with theme. Vital Lacerda, his play testers, and the people at What's Your Game can be rightfully proud of designing and producing this milestone in euro-style board gaming.

One play so far and this one seems to have it all. A lot of interlocking parts that can melt your brain. Scoring seems to be of the "focus on one thing, be good at the others, and grab the incidental bonus VP that work for you" mode (like Le Havre). The theme is really well integrated in this one, too, which is very cool.

RATING: 8
As my buddy yBob said, this is a "big boy game".  This is not for the meek or faint of heart.  There is a LOT going on, a lot that you need to do, and only 12 actions (not counting bonus actions) to do it in.  It takes at least 30 minutes to teach properly and my first 3p game took nearly 3 hours, but man, is it worth it.  If you like tight games, with a desperate scramble for resources, then I think you will like this.  This game is so good, that it jumps ahead of Le Havre on my top 10 and that's saying something.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Vinhos is a complex strategy game. It provides many options to gain points and to prepare and combine your actions. Understanding all the options and following a strategy requires some rounds of play. It's worth to invest the time.

In combination with the perfect realization of the vine theme (which I like), Vinhos is definetly on of my favourites of 2010.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A lot of seemingly arbitrary mechanics combined into a single game.  No way to recover from early mistakes so the game really punishes new players.  Random weather effects can completely disrupt game strategy, perhaps ruining the game for someone who has invested a lot in producing good wines in a specific year, or greatly benefiting someone who takes a risky strategy of producing a lot of cheap wines and gets lucky with good weather at the right time.  

Since there is no way to catch up once you are behind (assuming the winner player is even mildly competent), the last half of the game may just be a long coronation for the eventual winner (or another player who is out of the game  just has to tough it out).

I played with my wife, explaining the rules as the game unfolded, and she had no trouble absorbing any of it, including the "press release" and wine tasting fair.  I am impressed with the game.  The fact that the ultimate scoring trajectory is defined not by the quality of the wines produced by the players, but how the wines are put under the notice of the marketing powers-that-be that causes Vinhos to transcend into the realm of "simulation" rather than just a single-cycle economics game.  "Simulation", btw, is a compliment coming from me.

Games like this make me sad because they are so good yet there are so few people who are willing to play it.  This is a complicated game, there are a lot of things to consider and it can cripple you with available options and tight resource management.  But it is so well designed, exciting, and fun.  So few people are willing to struggle through a play, let alone play enough that they "get it".

In this game players are creating wines, trying to create the best wine to present at a fair for points.  There are also several other ways to score points and intricacies.  Like I said, it is too difficult a game to really give a synopsis, you'll just have to play it.  The game play is done with a quadrel system, a square of actions that you move across.

The game doesn't, in theory, actually take that long.  There are six total rounds and only two actions per round.  The length comes with the AP while players consider the voluminous decisions available to them and try to formulate some kind of cohesive strategy.  Money, the main resource in this game, is very tight and if you don't have somewhat of a goal or structure in mind you can find yourself bankrupt and on tilt.

This is honestly what I love about the game though.  There are so many options that games will be varied, interesting, and new every time you play.  It's a cliche compliment to give to a board game, but you can play a different way each time and still have a shot at winning.  My first game of this I completely ignored the 3 fairs and just accepted the point loss and still only finished 5 points behind the lead player because there are other scoring opportunities.

If you have the stamina for this game the payoff is so worth it.

Only one 4 player play. Too early to say meaningful words about this game although it seemed, at first sight, that it's a very tight and heavy game. Not sure if I like the combination of the several mechanics. Vinhos seems to be a bit clumsy at some point with players pointing out at everything but with no specific agenda. 

Have to play it again to see how it works, especially with fewer players. 

In the meanwhile and before playing it again, Vital deserves my appreciation for designing such a game.

What draws me to this game is the theme - its such a refreshing change from the middle ages. It looks like another economic game which pushes the genre on a little bit (the reputation cube distribution is very clever). It also (unlike Grand Cru) looks like the theme has been well integrated into the mechanics.

Three plays in.

wow is this hard to play. I have had to spend two games reminding peopl eof the rules at every point, which means i have been more of a moderator than a participant. When everyone knows what they are doing, AP aside, this is a 90 minutes game.

Whilst i am v keen to play this and explore this more i worry it is too laden with mechanics; the bank account/cash/investment part seems to be a pain. The taxation/pay another user feels artificial, too much a wrestling match with the game structure.

Derek Carver's description of this being a game where the designer has 'thrown in the Kitchen sink' is apt. I admire the ambition of trying to balance so many game elements but it just does not quite gel, especially at 90 minutes and 12 actions.

I like the way the weather tiles change the emphasis of the game, however expect a minus 2 at every point and you won't be disappointed

As a début design it must be commended for scope and ambition

RATING: 6
Detailed, intricate euro strongly themed on producing wine. Players move on a rondel-ish action grid of 9 spaces where adjacent spaces are free but moving further costs you, as does visiting a space with other players on it. Two spaces are for foreign export (victory points) and local sale (money); others allow purchase of vineyards, wineries, cellars, oenologists (improve production) and wine experts (special powers; improve showing at the wine fair). One space is for the bank: when you get paid your money goes into your bank account; you have to actually visit the branch to get it in cash.

Where it gets interesting is the opportunity to set endgame VPs and take bonus actions by establishing relationships with the managers (in a game with 12 regular actions, the chance to take up to 9 bonus actions is huge). There is just a lot going on: many competing incentives, many exclusive spaces, large point deltas between first in and second best. It's very tense, with, as they say, "multiple paths to victory".

But, for me, there is a lot not to like, starting with the many fiddly details which are awful to teach. Interaction with other players is all very typical for a euro -- competition for exclusive spaces and exclusive resources, a little increasing costs by taking an action first, a little turn order manipulation -- without the pleasing opacity of, say, a Winsome-style incentive-management game. I have a strong personal preference for games with a spatial element, and this one feels very much like playing a spreadsheet: changing a value in cell B2 to affect a total in column F. That's entirely legitimate in a game simulating running a wine business, but it feels like work.

It's a very solid game and I appreciate the depth and variety it has to offer, but I have no interest in the problems it has to offer. My rating reflects a middle-ground between an intellectual appreciation of the design (call it an 8) and a total lack of desire to play it.

A beautiful but complex addition to the worker placement genre.  It's a lot of fun and pretty long given that there are only 12 turns made by each player.  The artwork is gorgeous, the components sturdy, and the strategy deep.  I like this one.

So far, I've only played this as a 2-player game.  I REALLY enjoy it for that.  Given the fact that there are only 12 moves made by each player, each move MUST be optimal.  Money is very sparse in the game, and the strategy seems deep.  My rating might go up once I play with more people.

Rules explanation takes longer than the actual game. Clearly a bad sign. 

Usually I like games where you should do a lot, but only have very limited turns. In this game it's just too much. It feels like you are really working your brain to accomplish something, but it won't happen anyway. 

This game is just too complicated for its own good. Sure this game works (if you get pass the rules explanation and comprehension) and offers some tough nuts to crack, but there are better games out there. Equally deep, but more streamlined.

Very heavy euro with a well integrated theme. Very heavy though. I can imagine that 2 to 3 players familiar with the system could really get a lot out of it. Not sure if it's worth the learning curve for us though; I'd rather trade it for something more likely to hit the table more often, and send it to someone who'll give it the playtime it deserves.

Is this the fiddliest game ever created? The game is quite fun once you get your head around all of the little mechanics. It's certainly not the most complex game I've ever played, but there's just too much going on for it to be really fun.

A well-integrated VP-building engine that, with a less deft hand behind the development, could have felt like a bunch of disconnected and compartmentalized actions instead of the cohesive and organic whole that it is.

The fact that a 4-player game with 3 newbies took about 2-hours, including set-up, rules explanation and take-down, was a pleasant surprise.  I was expecting it to take at least an hour more than that.  Having said that, even though the game didn't overstay its welcome, it also didn't feel like I got to  accomplish nearly as much as I wanted to over the course of the game -- like a Stefan Feld design taken to its extreme.

As for its theme, players competing to develop the most prestigious name in the Portuguese wine industry didn't come through at all.  It was like the Wizard of Oz forgetting to hide behind the curtain.

Overall, it's a game I enjoyed my session with, and one I'd like to try again, but also one that I removed from my wishlist the day after trying it.

RATING: 6
It's a very dry and very complex game which expresses in a game time/rules explanation-ratio of about 2:1. But it is by no means unthematic. Especially the aspect of wines maturing got me. There's an abundance of actions you can take and with only twelve regular actions (possibly plus extra actions) there's also an abundance of scarcity. The game was over, when all of us felt like it would really start. 

+ great components/ artwork
+ lots of choices to consider
+ turn angst
+ "variable player powers" (different wine regions with different advantages)
+ left me with the urge to try it again and try to go for a different strategy
+ bonus for a good thematic transition despite being a monsterheavy eurogame

-- extreme turn angst
- no player aids (it could have really used some, in a game of this scale I expect player aids in the same great quality the rest of the game is in)
- was it fun or am I just curious?

+/- I'm undecided as to where my rating will go. So far it's a 6 out of 10, but it might go either direction.

Pretty standard euro gameplay and just too many rules. Even though the board does an incredible job of including reminders for almost everything, there are so many moving parts that it's just too much work to play for the time and rules investment. I'd much rather play any number of other euros.

Sold.

One of those games where the rulebook destroys it at first... but if you stick with it and try to figure it out, it becomes truly rewarding. I really love this game and if you can survive the first few tries with it(getting used to all of the rules) you will enjoy it as well. It is not light and requires a lot of heaving reading and rule checking by everyone. It needs constant attention. I now am excited to play this game.

Way too much chrome.  This game needed a developer to trim it down a lot. It has some neat mechanics. 

Problems include starting player imbalance and extreme effect of weather randomness.  If I were ever to play this again, I would insist on removing the -2 weather tiles.

One play under my belt and I found it to be a good hodge-podge game of several mechanics I like. I generally enjoy games like that, but only have enough room in my collection for a few of them. I already have Trajan, Dominant Species, and a few others that make this a title I can't justify having.

Overall, I enjoy it. It's a heavy-hitter with an original theme. Highly recommended for those who like heavy, more involved Euros.

This game is a bear to explain and it's not very forgiving, as the money is tight. The mechanics are many, but after a couple rounds it makes sense.

For new players, it might make sense to let them go first and maybe even throw them a couple extra bagos.

After a first play, I am very excited by this game. Gameplay is very clean despite the busy looking board. Available actions are clear, intuitive and have mostly  predictable results (surprises are limited to actions made by other players). This is a solid Euro with significant depth. Playtime seems appropriate for what it is and the theme is perfectly integrated. Actions and their effects make sense because they tie into the theme. Being a wine lover didn't hurt one bit.

First Impression:

A dry heavy euro with some good ideas.

The Good: It's fairly luck free, quite engaging for those that want to just challenge their mind with fairly complex rules, and has some nice interaction. I can see this being an interesting game for heavy euro fans.

The Bad: With so many great games out there, I'm too spoiled to enjoy this game. Several mechanisms are barely covered by the theme, and feel like they exist only to make the game more complex. I mean, going to the bank to draw money? Really? I no longer enjoy games that throw 5-6 mechanisms together just for the complexity without really mending them into a coherent package. 

I really felt half my time playing this game wasted.

RATING: 8
I just finished my 2nd game of this and my head hurts. Not mention I still don't know what to rate this game. I typically like to rate after my 1st game and update them as further plays come along but this one I just don't know. There is more going on in this game than in Bangkok massage parlor. Problem is there you can keep focused a bit as things come at your one at a time. This game you've got to keep it all in perspective as you can throw those barrels of wine all over the place and hope you did the best you could with them. Need more plays to justify a rating. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
2-player game: did not work for us, the competitive edge was too dull.

4-player: Much better, with more tension without being brutal. After the game everyone was uncertain what to think, but today there is an itch to try it again. 

This is Caylus++. Many will find that there are too many mechanisms, but there is fun to be had when producing wine, boosting your quality, racing to the fair with press releases or just going your own way to try out an entirely different strategy altogether... Mastering it is as much a practice in not making stupid mistakes as it is executing an efficient strategy.

Playing it doesn't quite make your head hurt Dominant Species-style, but expect more rules frustration, no matter how smart your group is.

Rating might go up or down from 8 based on next play, probalby based on whether the Wine fair will still feel clunky to us or as an integrated part of the game.

Update: We only got to play the game 3 or 4 times in total. This is the best game I will probably never bring back to the table again. Even though I still love it, the frustration of reminding the same people about the same little rules grew to tirering.If you have the same kind of fears, you might want to avoid. However, if you have 2 or 3 friends who are hardcore euro-lovers and willing to put down the time and effort to learn a great game in detail, go for it, don't even blink...

Vinhos is one of the most overwhelming games I've played. Initially there is an overwhelming board, tons of bits and a lengthy rules explanation. And that's because a lot is going on in this game. But if you can get through all that and grok the game, there is a really good game here.

It's interesting and I'd play it again. However. It's longer than it needs to be. It also has many elements which are anti-thematic, e.g. you make a wine, send it to the fair, and THEN get to improve its features, which makes no sense (unless the use of experts is meant to be bribing the judges instead of improving the wine). 

I'm not a huge theme gamer, but the more complex a game is, the more I would like the thematic elements to gel. It improves the experience and makes it easier to learn; Vinhos is much harder to learn than it should be because so many elements are counter-intuitive.

A bunch of small, mostly unrelated mechanics smushed together to make a game whose level of fun does not warrant the excessive complexity cost.  Rules take about an hour to cover and then the game itself takes a solid 2 hours to play on top of that, yet the decisions just aren't especially interesting or fun.

There doesn't seem to be anything new, interesting, or unique about the mechanics here.  The bank mechanic felt like it was purely in place to slow the game down and prevent you from getting a real engine going, which seems somewhat ridiculous in a game that only lasts 12 turns.  There's also a lot of fiddlyness present.

It wasn't terrible, but there is nothing redeeming about this game that would make me recommend it or want to play it again.

I absolutely adore this game! The only real downside I have found is the amount of mechanics and rules, which can be quite daunting to a new player. However, this can be successfully overcome by skillful and patient teaching, which undoubtedly comes with practice.

This will become a staple of my game nights.

First play (4p), and the game is really good... Need more plays to have a full picture, but it has many aspects which I love:
 * Nearly no randomization
 * Few decisions, all having an impact
 * Tight money
 * Great theme (very well "rendered")
 * Quite interactive (though your typical german-style interaction)

Of course, except the fact that "older" ressources can be much more valulable, hence some dilemnas on whether you should expense your wine to improve your engine NOW or wait a bit to get better improvement, but later, hence this, it is quite typical. Engine (production building first) then switch toward VP, Competition on rare ressources (Place for export/sell, Vineyards, Marketing cubes,...). Even VIP are almost a favor-like system. But this is very very very very well done, kudos to the author.

I had a lot of fun, but this was probably the most "opaque" first play of a game I played at bgg.con. It was very hard to see in the first game how to do things to get points. I was making wine, making money, spending money, but nothing was really happening points wise. After the game was over, it makes much more sense and I understand it a lot better now, so really want to play it again now that we know it.

For how long and intricate it is (learning the game from an excellent teacher will still take over 30 mins), Vinhos comes up a bit short on depth and substantially short on variability. It reminds me of Princes of Florence in that you must use a limited # of actions to assemble the different parts that add value to your VP generators (in PoF they're the profession cards, in Vinhos they're wines). What PoF has that Vinhos sorely lacks is an auction or some other significant form of direct interaction; without it the only things to keep the experience variable are the randomness of the different tiles. The sad part is that for all its bells and whistles, Vinhos isn't very opaque- after just a few plays I feel like there's nothing left to discover. A reminder that good game design isn't about just piling on one mechanic onto another, but actually weaving them in a way that the sum is greater than the parts. Reiner is a master at this; Vital not so much.

RATING: 6
This game is really unforgiving. There is a definite lack of resources and actions in order to do all that you want to do, similar to "Agricola" in this way. You have to maximize all of your moves in order to win. Agonizing, but also not in a good way, in the sense that it is not really fun. Meh.

Vinhos has so many moving parts that learning it made my head feel like it was going to explode. There isn't any single mechanism that is particularly overwhelming, it's just that there are so many of them. It's a bit like playing 5 mini-games all at once, each one interconnected with the next. This may be one of the few games that I would recommend having everyone that plays just read the rulebook, as explaining it to someone is just short of a nightmare experience...

If you can get through a couple of games, that feeling sort of dissipates and swings the other way. Now, I'm not sure there is a whole lot of room to play around within the game's structure. Despite the crazy amount of possible actions, you really have a soft cap of twelve moves per game. There are ways (and they are necessary) to bump that up, but still, even with the bonus actions you aren't even going to double that amount. It all seems rather constricting, not to mention it makes planning your one or two possible trips to the bank an excruciatingly difficult experience. I've recently heard people describing this game as broad rather than deep, which I didn't understand until I had played it a few times. I think I see it now. There are a handful of avenues to take, but you only have time for one...and the game will probably end before you have even fully explored it.

04/11/13 Update: After playing with a full compliment of four players, all having previous experience with the game, Vinhos has taken a bit of an upswing in my opinion. With four, the action box was much harder to navigate and this spurred us on to make better use of the game's combo potential. Also, while the number of actions allotted to players still feels like a tight squeeze, the options of what you can do to be productive seem to narrow significantly when playing with the full player count. This makes the action limit seem more in tune with what pursuits are realistically available to the players. I'm aware that this is a bit of an illusion, as the action count doesn't change at all. I think it might be that in a two player game the board seems wide open, but you can only do a couple of things. With four, you are doing the same couple of things, but since the board is so crowded, the limited actions feel not only appropriate, but expected.

I don't know if that makes any sense...but I do know that I enjoyed it much more with a full table. I guess I'm still not sure if this game is an onion, with many layers or a smorgasbord with a hundred things to eat and only a very small plate. I suppose that I'll just have to keep playing it until I figure it out.

I still think it's an excellent game, but I'm less inclined to play it now due to what I'm looking for in a game and more importantly, the length of time I'm willing to give a game to achieve what I want it to achieve. Still, the decision to keep or release this one will be tough.

I'm amazed by how Vital Lacerda creates all those interconnected systems in his games. One simple action cascades into a myriad of possibilities. Vinhos is a fantastic example of that. The execution of the theme is spot on, everything makes perfect sense. This is a top-notch economic euro (both in terms of mechanics and production quality - I just love how it looks on the table). Just keep in mind that it's really heavy and brain-burning, it's definitely not for the faint-hearted.

Just remember to use the offical change that sets the [b]16 VP limit for end game money multiplier[/b] -  otherwise the game appears broken to me (you are able to gain ridiculous amount of VPs for cash that way, much more than for any other end game multiplier). This change was also implemented in the new 2016 deluxe edition - Vital Lacerda learnt from his initial design mistake.

Beautiful board, some say too busy, I say lovely and colourful. The rules seem daunting but the mechanics are easy. Options, best route to victory are more difficult to determine. For some reason it seems like it is a slow/ponderous game to actually play but with practice it should be quicker. Beware the opportunity for AP though.  Once played with more than 2 I may rerate it.

Overly complex.  Seems like designer wanted to make the game complex just for complexity's sake.  Well crafted game, but more going on than is necessary.

With all the good buzz on this one, I'm going to have to try it again.

I tried it again - this time in the comfort of my home rather than in the chaos of BGG.  My friends and I enjoyed it, but took the game as a learning experience.  I think Vinhos isn't as complex as it first appears, but there are soooo many moving parts that it is difficult to learn the game yourself.

This game may go up or down after future plays, but I suspect that there will be future plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Vinhos lies very near to the sublte line dividing complex and complicated. It is probably more on the former one, and that's good.
There are so many things to be explained, so many things on the board, so many things to do that it is easy to feel dishoriented. During the game evrything gets better except that you always want to do 10 different things and you hardly know where to start from.
All in all, the game is though but flows quite well, it is not that long and it surely has a good replayability. Components are ok. Nothing exceptionally original in the mechanics and too many details to keep in mind are the worse aspects of the game. Try to play it the first time with someone that can explain it to you clearly, otherwise you'll be lost !
0.1 more points for the rendition of the theme makes it a 7.5

After my first play I was in love with this game. The theme is well implemented, it's deep and heavy, but after another play I found it too much of a slog to teach and even remembering the rules of the game. There are so many little exceptions, and sub-games, that in order to play I must study the rules for a long time prior to play.

I would still be up for another play, but only with devoted players that are willing to help with the rules.

2009-11: Tentative rating of a prototype:  [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b]  Hidden amongst the tannins are hints of [gameid=555] and [gameid=12188], with a nice bite of mechanisms that punish you slightly for letting someone else do what you want before you get to it.  All of this lingers nicely as you hedge your bets as to the best way to maximize your score while remaining solvent and capable of racking up more points.  [thing=42052]Vinícola[/thing] has not only a gorgeous color, but complex flavors to keep the connoisseur interested from cork to finish.

2010-12-02: Tentative rating of published game: [b][bgcolor=#33cc99] 9 [/bgcolor][/b] [thing=42052]Vinhos[/thing] has a lot in common with [thing=42052]Vinícola[/thing]; however they differ quite a lot, and play quite differently.  The published game is even more challenging, and leaves me strategizing after the game is over, anxious for another go.  The core of the game is the same, but there are some new aspects that provide interesting options.  For example, with Vinícola, the years before fairs were 3-3-3; in Vinhos, it's 3-2-1.  That means Vinícola gave players 18 actions over the course of the game; Vinhos, 12... [b]plus[/b] bonus actions through calling in favors with the Managers.  So you could have many more actions, if you jockey it well.  Money is even tighter in Vinhos than in Vinícola; however, due to the separation of balance and interest, you can pull some very interesting stunts at the bank, now.  There is much, much to explore in Vinhos before I can even pretend to be the wine game connoisseur I want to be....

2010-12-05: [b][bgcolor=#00cc00] 10 [/bgcolor][/b] As I'm starting to get plays under my belt (and adapt to the new incarnation of a favored game), I can proclaim that this is a fantastic game!  I'm hooked, and I haven't even popped the cork on the Vinho Verde in the basement to have with the game yet!

RATING: 6
So thematic, yet strategically challenging. Common opinion about heaviness is completely wrong. Maybe a bit too short and constrained for my taste. 

Unfortunately requires typical euro accumulation of vineyards and "doing everything" - doesn't award specialization which is such a big problem for me in so many euro games... Maybe even all of them... And especially in this game it kinda brakes a thematic touch for me - making high quality wine doesn't exactly pay off as much as it should. 
Gathering as many vineyards as possible, in order to have sufficient wines (quality doesn't matter) to pay for extra actions and modifiers with judges is simply disgusting, awful and it made me really angry - it resembles Feld's point salads and makes potentially phenomenal, although constrained game, into "yet another euro"... I'm so mad at this because the game actually looks and is beautiful and highly thematic.

酒类游戏的体裁可谓别出心裁，玩家在游戏里代表着几位葡萄牙的酒业大亨，从小小的葡萄酒庄园开始，逐渐发展自己的种植园，雇佣工人，扩建酒窖，参加酒博会，推广自身品牌，结识经理人，往返银行流转资金，将产品推广到国内外，最终成为酒业巨头的过程，葡萄酒文化在游戏中得以淋漓尽致的体现。可惜游戏为了更深刻的贴近真实，规则方面有些颇为繁琐和复杂，也因此将不少有兴趣的爱好者们拒之门外。对于偏好重度游戏的人来说，这款游戏自然是不容错过，是的，他就是专门为Geek准备的特供品。

While I liked Century: Spice Road, this game really sold me with the components! The art and the crystals did it for me!

Century Golem shares the same gameplay with Century: Spice Road. It's a deck building, hand management game with a little bit of engine building feel. You buy cards you use later on, and you can use every card you have over and over again - this is where the deck building/engine building comes in. There's a few strategies you can use, either complete the most quests as fast as you can or aim for the highest ones to get the most points.

All in all, this game is a great game and I will always recommend it! The re-skin is really great! I wish they will continue this re-skin for the next 2 games they have for the Century Line!

Smooth playing and beautiful. It has the luster of a finely hewn stone. I like the fast play and satisfying engine construction - of the simplest form. I can understand the comparison to Splendor (which I think is the better game), but this one stands on its own and solidly so. I like it!

I will start with the box it comes in. The box it delivers in is just as beautiful as the game box. I actually store mine in both boxes. The gameplay it’s self is similar to splender but different enough that it hits a different spot in my gaming. The art is some of the most beautiful I’ve ever had (I strongly recommend the play mat!). When you trade in gems using the cards the art on the cards actually shows that I just personally loved that touch. The components are amazing. The little soul crystals are great. Was a hit with me, my wife, and our ten year old daughter. Strongly thinking of buying a second copy and really hope the reconsider and continue the century line in golem as well because for me I will buy golem but not spice road. To bland for me in spice road. This will most likely stay in my collection for a long long time.

Exactly the same as Century: Spice Road. While a lot of people seem to love the artwork in this one, I feel like Spice Road's art is more appealing. I hate the gems in this edition; between their size, shape, and the awkward shape of their containers, they're harder to deal with than the simple cubes in nicely rounded bowls found in Spice Road.

The components are pretty nice. The gems are great. The actual gameplay is kind of boring. I'm not usually one to comment on "multiplayer solitaire", in fact I usually enjoy it, however this is THEE most solitaire game I've ever played... after a point.

The game has two phases really. Early on you're chasing cards to build your engine, and once you've got an engine set up you totally switch over and start gathering points. There is some light interaction while gathering cards. Once you're going for golems it's more or less on rails until the end of the game. 

Some have argued that there's a ton of interaction because someone can take the golem you wanted. I don't buy that as being interaction, especially since you'll just adjust slightly and get a different golem.

Unfortunately this very pretty game is just not very exciting.

i enjoyed this light economic, engine build game very much! In a way, it gives almost a splendor vibe of building an engine of resource adding cards to further yourself. However this has just a bit more strategy and choice to it. 

Highly recommend this (or its boringly themed counterpart)!

Incredible artwork - 100% better than Spice Road.  Really smooth gameplay, easy to teach and a lot of fun.  Components are excellent (again much better than cubes).

After playing this a bunch with 2 players, I've found it to be extremely approachable, yet having tremendous depth.  We keep finding new and interesting tactical choices that impact the outcome of the game... we've moved into a "Chess"-like mode where we don't have any extra capacity for small talk as we are trying to plan out our next  few moves and anticipate eachother's strategy.

Going for all high cards can win, going for all low cards can win--going for the highest value for the least Crystals, tracking how far you are ahead or behind in terms of score, extra crystals (e.g. trying to build up your caravan to contain enough crystals to purchase 2 cards in a row), the implications of being a card ahead or behind based on whether you were the first player or the 2nd... so many really interesting variables.

A ton of fun.  My current favorite and I like 2 player the best.

For a lighter option I really like this game.  The components are top notch, metal coins, beautiful art and high quality cards and components.  Packaged well with insert that makes it easy to set up and take down quickly, not to mention the game is easy to teach to anyone.  There is one double sided laminated card with instructions.   Great gateway game with depth enough to entertain the avid gamer looking for light, quick or filler activities to join in those less experienced in complex boardgames.  I don't write very many reviews but this game simply deserves the highest praise IMO.  I ordered direct from Plan B games because I wanted the bundle special including the mat and the game was shipped in a box within a box that was padded, arrived in pristine condition, you can tell they care 100% about their product.  If you can afford it the mat adds a ton to the presentation and ease of play with the cards.  
This game is identical in play to Century Spice Road, the only difference in the theme and artwork, but this is the best version.

Added with research into shorter/lighter games. The artwork looks amazing, and it's a relatively simple economic-based engine builder humming beneath the hood.

*Gateway to At the Gates of the Loyang

While the tension of the card race is palpable, I'm never really excited by the moves I make in this game - the game is straight up gem conversion.  It has a very skeletal feel.  In some ways I feel like this game is too smart for me, in that there are some really great efficient moves in front of me, between my hand and card row, that I'm not seeing; and I don't enjoy the game enough to tax my brain any harder to figure out what those moves are.  I guess I'm just kind of bored by the endless conversion loop.  I never really feel like I'm building toward anything.  It's more like a cycle that repeats four or five times.  

I like Splendor's feeling of progression much more - building a tableau to nab the nobles and a high point card or two, all the while racing for points.  In Century, I don't know what my longer term strategic goals are.  I just feeling like I'm trying to make smooth transitions for point card to point card - always trying the threaten the point cards with coins on them.  No real feeling of building though.

As to being a Splendor killer, my boredom with the bare bones gameplay of Century has definitely brought into question my enjoyment of Splendor.  I think about playing Splendor now and then, but I can't help feeling it's just a little too lean, like Century.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While I will confess, the added deck building aspect take this game beyond Splendor, it still suffers from hugely repetitive play and the game could likely end much sooner. I'm not entirely sure why they added the VP coins to incentify buying "goal" cards. Playing the game is an activity that is fairly pleasant and super easy to teach, but I would never seek out a game of Century.

I have never played the original version of the game, but it is clear they churned this one out to simply increase profit margins, as they are effectively identical. Personally I prefered the artwork and cubes of the original.

The illusion of control where there's only chaos. I already had my reservations after watching some videos, but was curious what the fuss was about, and tonight got a chance to play. Alas... 
It reminds me of those nights out where you took that a pretty blonde girl to your home, had great sex but discovered afterward that the only thing she was good for was that, that there was nothing inside her. 

And there is not even a Golem! Yes the box has great artwork, yes there are shiny things that you can grab, but it's about the game mechanics.
There is no game mechanics. You build your little engine and compare to others, everything is so linear. There is no suspense, there is no surprise, the draw of the cards dictates everything.
Played once, came 2nd, and felt like my IQ just dropped.
Compared to splendor, golem is for not so smart children. Plus the shiny things, that's just poisonous pvc, just what the world needs right now.

Deckbuilding (deck-drafting) to create an action engine that transforms low-value cubes into high-value cubes that are eventually redeemed for points. Do you want to swap cubes into other cubes for no reason other than the inherent desire and demand for cubes to be swapped? If so, this is an excellent mid-weight entry in the genre.

(11/17) 7. A solid game in the "Splendor" style with a handful of resources that can be upgraded and turned in for cards.  I don't think it's quite a Splendor killer, but I think I'd prefer to play it over Splendor, at least for now.  The Golem edition is probably my preferred one, though I don't understand the need for two editions with completely different art styles.

An interesting concept that just falls flat.  Just another game of many that doesn't look like it was playtested very much before being released.  One simple fix would be to organize certain cards to come out first so a lucky pull wouldn't benefit a person who could pay to get that card right after it comes out.  

Also, when one mechanic of a game is completely abandoned there's something deeply wrong with a game.  All three games of this I have played people just stop drawing cards from the draw pile and either play cards from hand or purchase cards.

Pleasant without being riveting. Your cards either collect gems, upgrade gems to better gems, or provide different formulae to trade in gems for other gems. On a turn you either play a card, acquire a new card to help you in future, get all your used cards back, or spend the gems you've diligently been collecting, upgrading, and trading for to buy VP cards. This is reminiscent of the old Bazaar, but more interesting here because you build your own collection of trade-up formulae and try to parlay that into point-scoring collections faster and more efficiently than your opponents. The rules are easy, the game is pacey enough with some good think-stuff provided, but it features a fair amount of luck in regards to what cards are on offer to buy on your turn (is there anything at all that can help build a better engine?) and whether the VP cards on offer match the gems that your engine can build efficiently. The real knock is that once you've played, that's it, there's not much more to learn or experience - you're going to get the same game next time and the time after that. If you're ok with that, this does the whole gem tradeup whatsup thang pretty nicely.

Century is an alright trading game of converting goods into other goods. The downside is that after the first few minutes of the game, everyone has picked up a few cards and essentially created their engine that they will then operate for the next 30 minutes to generate gems to collect points. There's limited interaction going on at that point and little to nothing players can do if someone has assembled a good combo of trading cards early.

The gems are fun to handle and the art adds so much character to the game. I’m glad they made this edition because spices are a snooze. Quick and easy to play.

I like how this is a bit of a deckbuilding game without a deck. The hand management choices in this game are really smart. Players have the tools to eventually build any golem but the game is all about find optimal efficiency. Doing this requires some smart tactical play, while still having an eye out thinking a few turns down the road. Every game will present a new card combination and puzzle on how to reach max efficiency. I think that will mean this game has a lot of replayability.

It's ok for what it is.  I'm not usually a fan of lighter games, so that's always going to work against these types of games.  It's beautiful and the gems have a nice feel to them.  It might be a smidge long for the type of game it is too and I'm not overly excited about what I'm doing while playing it.

I've taught well over 50 people how to play with Spice Road and I loved every minute of it. So I just had to spoil myself with the Golem edition! Simply love this game!

[4 plays] This is Century Spice Road themed with gems and golems rather than spices and caravans. Like its fraternal twin, it is an outstanding game with simple rules, fast turns, and meaningful decisions every turn. Love it.

This game has the engine-building and long-term planning that Splendor doesn't. And also it is GORGEOUS. Light enough to jump right into, but there's wayyy more to be explored here. Experienced players will almost always beat newcomers.

Use gems to acquire different gems, and use gem combinations to buy points. Done. Light game to teach and get into, fun, games don't last too long. 

Love the gem pieces in this edition, way more interesting and tactile than cubes.

Simple enough for my kids to PLAY but probably not yet grasp the efficiency of generating the right golems at the right time (when to just grab that golem, when to wait for the others beneath it to get taken so you can get coins too). They tend to get one, MAYBE two, crystal miners (or whatever they are called) and spend their time using the same three or four cards to build their carts. That means it has a great deal of replay value for me, because I'll NEVER see all the cards (I with with seven or eight cards in my hand, they each have three . . . and that's counting the two everyone starts with).

While there are clear similarities to Splendor, I MUCH prefer this one (and I have no hate for Splendor, but I'll play it on my phone and Century face-to-face).

I like this game a lot.  Plays as well as it’s spicier sister, without the frustration of trying to remember what color is what spice (yes, saffron in dried form is red, but is widely used to color food yellow - I dunno why, but it bugs me). Wish Plan B would would continue this theme for the whole trilogy, but sources say not gonna happen.

Beautiful artwork, simple and elegant gameplay.  I can see why it's called a "Splendor killer".  Splendor will always have a special place in my heart, and I will continue to play it, but this game is pretty fantastic.

Want to replace spice road with this version , due to better components and art.

It's century spice road, but with better art and components.  Also, much better for near color blind players. Lovely gateway/next step games.

RATING: 9
Fun engine builder that is streamlined and plays quickly. Lots of interesting decisions and a decent amount of strategy. Components are high quality and the artwork is absolutely gorgeous. I appreciate the Crystal Golem theme as a feel that the trading-in-the-Mediterranean theme is overdone.

RATING: 8.75
The artwork in this game is fantastic (and certainly leagues better than its sibling, Century: Spice Road). Although I understand the comparisons to Splendor, I think that both games can coexist in a collection, particularly because of the differences in how your hand of cards works and how you acquire resources. I personally enjoy Splendor more because it feels more streamlined, but Century: Golem is still a game that I enjoy every time it hits the table.

This is a reskinned version of Century: Spice Road. Basically they took a bland game with excellent mechanics and replaced the artwork with cool unique golems and nice little gems.

I buy quite a few boardgames - including lots of family games - and I usually let my 8 year old son help me open them. I've never seen him EVER be as animated and excited/enamoured by a game as he was when we opened Century: Golem Edition. Great game!
More plays. My daughter and wife normally aren't into boardgames but even they seem to have made an exception for this game. Still loving myself.
No interest in Century: Bland Road version at all.

RATING: 7
This edition has much prettier components than the original game. Just like with Splendor though, the first couple of games of Century were really fun, but after that it loses its shine a little. Still a fun game to throw into the mix as a dessert a couple of times a year.

Great game. I think I will prefer this over the Spice Road but time will tell. I wish it was getting the expansions
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
From the art on the cards to the metal coins to the big chunky gems to the trays to store the gems, the components here are fantastic. Gameplay is easy to understand, and therefore easy to explain. You'll have to adapt your strategy to the not only the market row, but also the row of scoring cards. The gameplay won't be wildly different game to game, but you definitely will have to figure out how to combo each game's available cards to make the most efficient engine.

Splendor meets Jaipur. This game is streamlined and excellent in basically every way. This version is a really neat re-theming of the original. I love the artwork and chunky components.

Three of these plays are actually from the regular edition.

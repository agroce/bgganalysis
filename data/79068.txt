If this would only have been a cardgame, I'd have rated it no higher than a 7. But the added puzzle of moving around things to get a specific layout on the table is fun and a commendable idea for adding another element to the game.

Game was...interesting?  It's an abstract molecule building game.  Their attempt at humor really took away from the game for me, and I'd probably remake cards before playing again.

Some things are best left as it is. Science should be science, so will chemistry be it too.

The constant exercise to move tiles and tokens to fit an element is not exactly a game, it's an annoyance. The extra point I gave was due largely to humor. 

I could not bring myself to its final end, except with great encouragement from the other gamers. It's not a dexterity game, it's just a solo exercise to complete a need from a card.....it's as bad as Dominion.

It's in the garbage......

Not only the chemistry is wrong with this one. Coming from a science background I really hoped this game would be fun. But in fact, there is so much wrong with "Wrong Chemistry" that I don't even know where to begin. Components maybe: The game looks cheap, the game feels cheap - sadly it wasn't cheap at all. The card quality is way below standards with the card edges wearing off after only a few plays. And don't even think about trying to put the expansion card sets back into their fiddly cardboard envelopes - you will end up ruining both. The rules layout looks like it was done by a blind monkey and that's not even the worst thing about the rules. No, the worst thing is that someone tried to be funny and utterly failed. It is a rare occasion that in my gaming group the one reading the rules feels ashamed of what he is just reading aloud. But at least the game is consistent in that the supposed humour of the cards was lost on us, too. The gameplay is basically people playing a solitaire game with the same components. There is no interaction. The game even discourages any kind of interaction because it's always easier to do the free reset and build an easy 1 point element than discarding an already scored point in order to get a shot at building a 2 or 3 points element that the next player may then re-use for free. It may work as a solo game but since I don't play solo games, I have absolutely no use for this one. (This is for the Mage Company (2012) edition using the German rules included with the game.)

Really interesting puzzle type game play here. You have four actions a turn to rearrange the atom in the centre of the table into the atom on the cards you hold to score points. Bonus points are scored for a run on periodic numbers.  

They have tried to be funny with some of the names and illustrations on the cards and the periodic table number could be bigger. The scientists add a twist to the game play, but the  additional elements are very forgettable, which is a little dissappointing.

Sold with promos in a board game bundle in 2017.

RATING: 4
The basic idea of building molecular shapes on a shared board may sound like fun but the implementation is pretty rough in places. The most obvious problem is that there is no interaction whatsoever and thus the winner is the player who either draws several synergistic goal cards or is lucky enough to have his predecessor leave the board in a state that fits his goal cards. Since the goals are fairly simple there is very little room for good or bad play, and thus the winner is almost entirely determined by the card draws.

It's a game which revolves mainly around recognising the shape of certain fictional elements and reproducing them. You'll need mostly luck to win this game, but it has got a tactical twist.

When you create elements in consecutive numbers you'll get bonuspoints. Also you can trade elements you already created for more actions in your turn.

RATING: 6
This is a unique little abstract game with very funny theming. I think it could be very fun and challenging with 2 players. With 4 players, however, (and, I would guess, probably with 3 as well) the board changes so rapidly that there is no point whatsoever in planning ahead and your success hinges almost as much on other players unintentionally setting you up as it does on you playing well. There is a bit of strategy (especially in determining when to use the extramovium), but the game essentially comes down to solving a series of unconnected puzzles - which oftentimes tend to be significantly easier or harder than they should be based on the amount of points you receive for them. While that will even out over time, it can swing the game heavily in one direction or another in the short term, and even when it doesn't, your move each turn is basically predetermined by the fact that you have to score at least 1 card in order to keep from falling behind and your choice of cards is extremely limited.

I play the game with my son, that is to say only as a 2p game, and although this is a nice puzzle pattern-recognition game, its long duration always bothered me. So, we use 5 cards and 5 action points per player in order to shorten the playing time. It actually works pretty well this way.

A simple puzzle type game of making molecules. The theme is all over this one. The rules are very easy and only one page long. Each card shows a molecule shape you need to make. You get four actions per turn to move, remove or rearrange the tiles and try to finish a molecule. Each molecule card has a set of victory points you will receive at the end of the game. And my favorite mechanic is trying to complete sets of three or more consecutive molecules (i.e. molecule 3, 4, and 5; or 195, 196, and 197). This is tricky and luck of the draw, but fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Light abstract card game. Some strategy, but mostly tactics in using your turn actions to change around board pieces to match molecular patterns on the cards.

Easy to teach and play. Humorous graphics and molecule names. 

Plays a little long for what it is.

6 hexa, pár fekete és pár fehér korong. Egy alapmolekulából próbálnak a játékosok 4 akciópont felhasználásával a kezükben levő kártyákon látható molekulákat kirakni. Akcióponttal áthelyezni lehet hexát, le és felrakni és áthelyezni lehet korongot vagy lapot cserélhetünk. Nekem a Turbo Taxit juttatta eszembe, de annál nagyobb benne a szerencsefaktor így a jobb térlátással megáldott ember is megverhető benne. Szép a kivitel, de semmi extra. Gyors, pörgős játék. Átvezetőnek egyszer-kétszer elmehet, de azért vannak jóval jobbak erre.

Wrong Chemistry is a game, where chemistry is not wrong, just fun. Simple fun, where you are struggling to fulfill card goals on a common board, where you create, move and destroy molecules of different crazy compounds. One of main attractions is in clever names and illustraions on the cards. But it would not be enough. Much more important is the whole gaming impression, which is based on a tug-of-war principle for task completion held secretly in hands. Unfortunately all these cards are randomly drawn, so luck plays a huge part in your choices. And scoring is even more luck-based, because you do not score only for completed cards, but also for straights in their numbers in periodic table. And those complicated cards can be finished only with extra move. To get it, you must throw away a less valuable card you have completed earlier. This might be noted as a pro or con, based on your preferences. It presents an interesting choice. Wrong Chemistry is not a bad game, its quite fun and looks nice. It just has few atoms on bad positions..

RATING: 5
This is an unfortunately tedious game of the genre "use limited actions to arrange shared state for your goals", with the classic and irritating flaw of the person who either
a) draws cards that are close to each other or
b) is fortunate enough to have the previous player leave things in an helpful state will win.

There's a slight cute-ness in that you can spend previously won score cards to grab extra moves, maybe translating them into better score cards, but that's it.

It's clear from the expansion rules that they're aware of the big problems, since they're fixed to varying degrees, but the underlying game is fundamentally meh.

In its current form, tedious. I'd far rather play Trafffic or similar, which gives you real-time operations on the shared state.

Too much easy or simple game, is not a real challenge to do the particles, perhaps with less energy points. And you cannot do anything but to wait your turn and see what happen in the board, and the "resert" mechanics doesn't help to this. 

Anyway, it can be right for the kids, but it's a pity that it takes no advantage to teach some basic real chemistry to kids

Tried out the print to play version.  If you really like abstractness then you might like it.  But I'm not sure about replay.  You prep the atom for possible future shapes that you want and save low number elements to take earlier turns.  Or hope that other people have similarly complex elements and wait for them to shift it around to suit you.  It's cute.  It's a little different.

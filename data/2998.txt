 Juego muy interesante y divertido Y más aún si solo tiene 224 fichas (marcadores incluidos). Asimétrico. Los blancos mueven por medio de "bandos" mientras que los rojos mueven por chits de frentes. Los blancos tienen muchas unidades con muchas excepciones y limitaciones. Los rojos unidades muy fuertes, pero que mal jugadas pueden ir cayendo una a una. Tiene un sistema de combate especial, donde aúnan al mismo tiempo proporciones con modificaciones al dado. Al principio un poco lioso, pero en 4 turnos se convierte en un juego ágil y divertido. Merece ser acabado.

A fantastic game. It solos super. The activation chits, low counter density, random events and stuff like Trotsky's Train and Nestor Makhno's Anarchists make the game one wild ride to play. The rules are easy, but do have some special cases and exceptions that prevent it from being an ideal beginners game. This is a very fast and playable presentation of the Russian Civil War. One of Ted Raicer's small masterpieces.

I liked the battle system of comparing manpower versus experience. I'm not convinced the Red player has an advantage unless we played wrong. The advantages of having more units in a stack, even if out manned 1 to 3 means even a lower roll could go in the favor of the player with more units.

Neat system on an often forgotten topic.  The chaos of trying to co-ordinate the Whites is well depicted.  While the Reds can be beaten, it takes very carefull planning to do so and a bit of luck.  Still, that is what happened historically so that is ok by me.  Plays well solitare .

RATING: 4
I've come to hugely respect Ted Raicer, but he has one major blind spot IMHO: game length. This is an interesting and tempting game that is way too long for what it is. There isn't enough action to fill out the 6+ hour playing time, and it gets to feeling repetitive and grinding. Unfortunately, there is probably no easy way to trim the playing time to somthing acceptable without a substantial redesign. RTC was similarly a great game that was too long, but it had a more interesting and fluid situation that seemed to hold my attention; Reds! doesn't. The other thing with Reds! is that it seems to be a design into which he just threw a bunch of wierd stuff to see how it works; the combat system, while unique, is mystifying as to its purpose. Oh, and the faction rules are incredibly fiddly. Despite this ultimately a near miss, but "near miss" means "hits the trade/sale pile ASAP".

"Partisans near the tracks!"   

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:USSR_stamp_V.V.Ivanov_1965_4k.jpg

Update, 1 play, Whites: Tsar lived. A big lucky help with rally phase. Seemed like part controlled collapse sometimes, but Reds have a large task including big mop-up. Managed to win a couple battles with 1-2 attacks, take Petrograd. Overall doomed, withdrawal ratcheting the grip of fate. So it feels different, possibility to win despite tone of certain gloom. Red Train is huge asset for Bolsheviks!! "Damn Red Train!!" Good game.

Unjeu très sympathique et interactif entre les joueurs avec le tirage des marqueurs d'activation.
Seul le scénario de 1918-1919 est intéressant à mon avis car il peut se jouer en une après-midi. 
Le scénario allant jusqu'en 1921 doit devenir pénible à supporter pour le joueur "blanc" jusqu'àla fin du jeu.
Des règles bien écrites avec quelques lacunes néanmoins. Un matériel simple et agréable.

RATING: 8
A fairly small number of combat units - the activation sequence replicates the disorder of the actual Civil War.

The White player should be fairly conservative for the first few turns.

RATING: 3
After one play of the short scenario, not too impressed. Both my opponent and I agreed that it just isn't particularly interesting to play the Whites, who are basically doomed. I don't see anything short of a bad combination of horrendous luck and terrible game play leading to a victory for the Whites.

I understand that they lost historically, but the victory conditions for the tourney scenario should put the onus of victory on the original victors in order to keep things interesting. As it stands, the Reds can deliberately delay the Polish entry into the war, pick off the White units piecemeal (especially if they have a leader), and keep them under 5 resources without breaking much of a sweat for the win.

Consequently, the overall game play is fairly flat, and the playing time about twice as long as the mechanics can support before you get bored with it. The Whites do get to make the occasional surgical strike, but it ain't much. Attempts to use the cossacks for flanking maneuvers sound good in theory but are badly hampered by the supply rules that don't let you move out of supply to gain a superior position, with the result that they're often little more than fast infantry.

On the flip side, if you're playing the full game, I would just ignore the gold, and use a defense in depth strategy with the Siberian faction along that narrow north-south rail line. With no way to flank due to the supply rules, and no way to cause more than 1 step of damage at a time, you can delay your way to victory by holding Omsk. If this sounds as tedious and gamey to you as it does to me, that's because it is.

Anwyay, this is clearly a game best played solitaire, and even then I would only play the tourney scenario, as playing beyond that would be quite a dreary experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Wild and chaotic, as a game on this topic should be. As such, the key is to minimise the harm when the chaos is going against you and maximise the benefits when your fortune is high. Ultimately I find it a bit long for what you get and the White player needs strong moral fortitude in a game where not being totally eliminated counts as victory.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent game that manages to capture the desperation of the russian civil war. The game mechanisms are brilliant but the game itself suffers from a heavy scripted approach as well as the designer's belief that the whites forces were doomed from the start (barring a miracle).   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Quite a simple game, that gets bogged down in special rules for the different factions and fronts.  I can't help thinking the combat system could be streamlined a bit also.  Still, Ted Raicer is the best there is, and there is plenty to like here, starting with the different ways the two sides play.  Certainly worth a look.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
like the real conflict, very chaotic especially with the events table and the way the units activate. love the combat system, which offers both uncertainty and control. The rules are pretty simple, with the biggest hurdle being some exceptions that the players need to keep in mind, but nothing overwhelming.
Advice for the White player: don't fall prey to the temptation of easy attacks. Most of the time it's not worth it, especially since most of your units do not come back. Let the Red go after you and exploit his mistakes.

RATING: 9
This is a real easy game to learn, and difficult to master.  There is no need to use the Optional Rules, certainly, not all of them.  Maybe just one for White.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A highly chaotic game of the Russian Revolution on a grand scale. It is a neat low-density slug-fest, and the attacker is usually favored. It has very little emphasis on tactics or positioning. The decisions are more often about risk management and managing the setbacks that will be dealt to you.
 
Though I don't stay up at night dreaming about the game, I found Reds! is a fun, chaotic, play-by-seat-of-your-pants kind of game and I recommend it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Preliminary rating based on a few turns of solo play only. I am looking forward to playing a full game with an opponent, as it looks very interesting (and chaotic, as it should). Interesting experimental combat resolution. I like the way the strict supply rules force the action to occur at key railroads and crossings. Excellent production values once again from GMT.

RATING: 8
One of the games that teaches history as well as reenacts it. Interesting and entertaining system which I believe, catches the historic mood and accuracy quite well. Could be quite repetitive, like a boxing match with two contestants trying to wear the other out. The tricky part in playing is whether one should attack or defend, as attacking is advantageous but could also be devastating to the attacker. The down side is that it takes a long time to play and many re-readings of the rule book the first tame. Plus, what good is the Central Asian Front? Nothing happens there and it doesn't affect the game very much. A good game all the less, and I´m looking forward to new sessions with it.

Russian Civil War is an elusive conflict to convey on a wargame successfully, especially in the level of abstraction Ted Raicer has worked. Some things seem to work and others don't. Combat system is a bit bizarre but I don't dislike it. Anyway, the course of the game feels a bit weak and dull, a bit too predictable, with a narrow range of options to the White player. Exceptions and nations' particular rules try to make up for abstractions but some of them are easy to forget while playing and slow down the dynamics. 

I should play it again to confirm these impressions.

Great game.  Some of Mr. Raicer's games I didn't care for too much, but this is an exception.  The operation of drawing chits for activation is quite good and interesting, especially for the Red player.  The chits that the Red player has available to use from, varies, depending on Red Leaders, and the time period.  The Whites have to strike and strike fast in an effort to keep the Reds in a quandary as to where they will attack next and which White Faction shall lead the way. They, more or less, have to kill time, because in order to win the Red player has to be in control of virtually the whole map. For the most part the rules are well written and precise and easy to understand.  Mr. Raicer was readily available and helpful with any questions that I had. As with all GMT games the quality is great.  A must have for Russian Civil War enthusiasts.

Provisional rating. Fine components, game mechanics and atmosphere. Great work!

Notice: white has to open in a specific way. That is starting with the siberians, abandon the gold, withdraw towards Ufa; point being reaching turn B without losing permanently dotted forces. From there on white appears to stand just as good as a chance to make it.

Solid wargame but highly unbalanced. Also, the lack of any political chrome makes it a little too dry.

RATING: 7
Not sure what to say, except that this game needs to be played past the point of "I want to quit".  It will always start with the Whites getting hammered and very little going their way, but then the Great War will end and they'll get a big windfall from the Allies and be able to push back.  The Reds will have to survive this hard time and try to keep as much of their gains as they can so that they force the Allies out of the civil war and then slowly beat different White factions to death.  An interesting game for sure.

RATING: 5
initial rating based on solo play.  quite an easy set of rules and fast-playing (relative to it's main competitor, Triumph of Chaos).

the combat system takes some time to get your mind around, and I'm not sure I'm completely taken with it favoring the attacker so much - are garrisons meant to be anything but a speed bump?

aside from the combat system, the game will clearly turn into whack-a-white, which makes things not so interesting for the white player in a long(ish) game.

RATING: 9
  Wild and wooly.  Actually prefer it to "Triumph of Chaos," in that it doesn't take that long to play, and seems to mirror the movement of the Whites closer (in ToC they have a hard time getting to the Ukraine and threatening Moscow from the south, as they did historically).   Like PoG, tends to come down to the last move.

One ftf and one solo game played (short scenario)

Colourful (in may ways) wargame on the subject of the Russian Civil War. Core mechanics are fairly simple for anyone with hex and counter experience, although there is a lot of chrome around special units and the different factions.

The two sides play very differently, with contrasting strengths and weaknesses.

Long but (like the best hex and counter games) absorbing.

RATING: 8
Excellant feel, I Like the big picture of the conflict and the wide seep of Russia it presents. Both sides have many choices for attack and defense (though eventually the Whites will be ground down). The random events and activation ensures adds variability to play. Plays better with the optional set up for the whites rules 

One issue for me, it seems that the Poles are too weak and can be defeated too easily in the end game..IMO

Got my clock cleaned playing this at CSWX in 2011; if you make a strategic error the game will punish you for it with gusto, and that's a good thing. Lots of chrome and exceptions and so forth, and the combat procedure is headache-inducing to a math idiot like me. But whose soul is not stirred by a cavalry raid galloping forth across the steppes to wreak havoc behind the Bolshevik lines? Whose will could remain unbent by special units like Trotsky's Red Train, chugging hither and yon and cranking out propaganda to rally the troops? Whose mirth is not aroused by the inscrutable Makhno and his merry band of anarchist partisans?

Surely this is a game that bears further play. The people demand it.

Another masterful game from Ted Racier. Takes a little time to understand the game dynamic versus the historical context but after that it is a hoot. Reds are too strong against the Poles at the end but that's not really what the game is about anyway. A little bit long to play but overall a satisfying and exciting game covering a fascinating period.

RATING: 8
Are Lenin and Trotsky included?  A period always fascinating in historical terms but not always in military terms.  I do not know whether the game can produce a valid historical results while challenging players enough.  Also, this game could only be of interest if revolutionary story can be blended nicely with the military aspect of the game.  A tough task for any game designer.  I own a copy of The Russian Revolution by Azure Wish.  Wonder how do they compare. I am looking forward to GMT reprint of this game very much so. They underestimate the sales of this and so produce less than the demand. People like me who don't P-500 missed this game.

Reds! is a relatively light strategic game, although there is some chrome.  I'm not really a strategic game fan (hence, I'm sure, the relatively low rating), but I am a Ted Racier fan, so I got lured in.  The game was a lot of fun, but at one point the Czechs nearly took Moscow?  Russian incompetence or game randomness?  It's hard to tell from one playing.  I think experience would be a big help in this game, more so than in most games this simple.

The rules are clear and the game plays out in an easy day.  The CRT is unusual in that both the odds ratio and differential enter in, along with a die roll, but it seems to work well.

The pieces are big and thick, the player aid cards are on solid stock.  The map, while easy to read is printed on flimsy, glossy paper.  That's the only component that didn't come up to GMT's usual high production standards.

Huge fan of the topic, was very impressed by this game. Unfortunately it's so damn hard for the whites to win. Custom dice made for each faction. Not a huge fan of exception based design.

One of my favorite Ted Raicer games. if Rossya 1917 is an operational treatment this one is a strategic one.

Low score only because its not really good for two players. Once red player figures out what to do its game over in 2 turns. In our case it happened on 1st game (honestly I can't think of a case why red player should do anything else). We tried it again, this time white player knowing the real weakness and trying to defend that and work around it. Despite very very good (almost perfect) start from white player it was still over when revolutionists brought the muscle to bear. And when that that one critical part of the puzzle falls too quickly everything else doesn't really matter anymore. A very very sad face here :( We both really loved the mechanics and feel and everything, but we just can't really play it. Asking one player not use a strategy or other one just to sit thought the motions till the end it pointless for us. 
On the other hand, if your solo-player I'd suggest you give it a whirl, its a good game and interesting look at the Russian revolution and civil war.

I was glad this went out of print so I could rid myself of it at a profit.  Far too hopelessly straightjacketed to provide a good game, and too long to sustain itself as an interesting history lesson, this is a stellar example of a designer loving a period too much.  Everything that is important is in there, except room for the people who will actually play the game.

Large hex game of the Russian Civil war in which the Reds use their central postion to fend off White offensives from all directions. The Red armies are larger than their opponents, but less quality, and need total victory to win the game. The use of assets like tanks, planes and armoured trains increases the strength of units, and it has an odd, but useful combat system, you roll a die and multiply it by the number of units for their strength total, adding or subtracting their quality. I find Trotsky's Red Train too powerful, and instead of rallying adjacent units I have him -2 to their rally die rolls.

A good war game covering the Russian Civil War. The chit drawing mechanics makes the game very solo friendly. A pretty friendly war game to learn as an opening hex and counter game. It is not too much a game about out maneuvering, but moving with supply routes and finding opportunities to strike your opponent.

Working through the first game. Not that hard to play but the details, coming as abundant rules exceptions, make it difficult to get started. Unfortunatly,the combat rules make all the research and details of the rules, units, fronts and factions moot. The wide variations in combat results may be a good representation of the actual historical conditions, but they overwhelm every other aspect of the game, including the players. Takes too long to play for this chaos to be worthwhile. (And 3 of the White factions are distinguished by colors that are too close together for easy identification: Blue, Blue-Green, and Green.)

Not going to rate it, but I found this one pretty dull as compared to A Victory Denied.  The combat resolution was interesting, but the strategy seemed a) fairly scripted b) overly dependent on the event roll for the White player in particular. 

SOLD because I don't seem myself sitting down to play it again.

The theme appeals. The rules have too many annoying holes and there's no publisher or author support here in the forum, alas. So far, played once solo to try it out. Realistically, it looks unlikely I'll convince someone else to learn and play it with me, as there are shorter and easier to learn wargames. :/

I have similar feelings about this game to the designer's other game, Paths of Glory. I love the way the unusual combat system reflects the differences between the large and initially clunky Red Army and the small, brittle and well-trained Whites. The chit activation reflects brilliantly the difficulty that both sides had coordinating campaigns on different fronts, while the supply rules are excellent in showing how important the railways and rivers were. 

However, like Paths of Glory, I feel the game is too stacked in the favour of the historical victors. In the case of PoG, this is probably just a sign of my lack of experience with the game. Here, though, it is the deliberate intent of the game designer. On the one hand, this is to do with the real reason for the White side's failure: their inability to overthrow the Bolsheviks with military force was essentially a product of their political mindset which precluded the necessary reforms to win over the support of the millions who were ambivalent about Bolshevik rule. Of course, the game can't give you the option of changing this, so you have to work it into the system. However, I do believe, even given the Whites' political views, the Bolsheviks did not have it as easy as they do in this game. For one thing, Raicer has left out many of the anti-Bolshevik, non-White forces. They do not have to contend with a Kronstadt rising, for example. Moreover, the non-Russian forces seem very weak to me. Just compare how many units the Poles have in this game to the massive army they get in Triumph of Chaos. The Ukrainians etc. are only represented by piddling garrisons which can't even move. 

Nevertheless, I give this game a higher rating than PoG because I'm interested in the period and love some of the mechanics.

Things I like about Reds!:
The elegance of the game system; I see it as being fairly simple and yet it portrays all relevant aspects of that civil war. I also like the rule book as it is written, with the contents well organized and the prose explaining every concept concisely and yet completely (I admire such accomplishment). The chit pull system gives the game the necessary randomness and creates enjoyable tension. Interestingly the supply status is also checked through a chit token that is drawn randomly with the rest of the chits representing the different fronts which creates extra tension. Would your fronts activate in time to try to regain the just broken supply chain before the supply chit is drawn?
In my game a great story developed through the turns and every chapter (turn) engages you to see what's coming up in the next, with the final turns been the most exciting.
I also enjoyed the historical notes and the designer's notes.
Beautiful extra sturdy box, really pleasant to hold on hands.
 
Things I don't like: nothing at all that I can remember
 
Specific rules
Because of the level of detail desired for this simulation some number of specific rules are needed. I think their relative weight in the rulebook is correct, but because of these minor rules this game may be not perfect for everyone as it is not the streamed version it otherwise would have been. Having a previous interest in the topic helps with this less generally appealing aspect of game rules. For the good, the game includes a player aid with a summary of all these specific rules.
 
Overall it has been a great experience as a game and as a story/simulation. Only with one game played and without having played many wargames to compare, I will give it a 9.

Solid hex and counter wargame depicting the Russian Civil War. The game replicates the multi-front nature of the conflict through a chit pull system, whereby a player can only activate units in a certain area once their specific chit is revealed and this leads to a welcome amount of randomness as the player hopes he can gain the initiative before his opponent. Combat is unusual in that the column used for results is determined by unit strength and the dice rolls modified by the number of units committed to a battle as well as the individual units' combat modifiers. Victory is determined by capturing certain key cities across the area of conflict, although this is an incredibly difficult goal for the Whites to accomplish (they have the ability to stack more units together than the Reds but aren't as strong and don't get anywhere near as many reinforcements). 'Reds!' does a good job of faithfully recreating this conflict (one that is under-represented in wargames) and there's a real challenge for the White player, resulting in a game that will get revisited.

Very nice activation system & CRT. Clear rules easy to learn. The eastern part of the map may have been designed differently : right now it's a place where almost nothing happens but that uses 1/3 of the map surface. The Whites have a VERY difficult task and won't easily win a sudden death victory. Use of the optional setup is recommended for play balance. Excellent for PBEM.

Better than I was expecting.  Interesting design with a reasonable amount of historic chrome.  Tense game with lots of historical flavor, but it plays a bit too long.  The combat mechanics are unique although I'm not really sure what this is trying to represent.  While a lot of people claim the game is too biased for the Reds, I found the Whites can win with the second edition rules and optional rules.

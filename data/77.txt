First Impressions - The reason this is a classic quickly becomes clear. Trying to move the front is like pushing a heavy slab of rock, and yet you know it's possible.

Without having played the game it was difficult to know how exactly to make an effective drive, but after one play I already want to try it again.

The command and production systems are particularly brilliant, and show just how costly it is to make a major assault.

Plays:

Eastfront is a wonderful game.  It captures the size and scope of the Eastern Front just right!  It doesn't try to minimize the game with 20 pieces and a small map.  At the same time, you don't get some OCS monster with 10 maps and 3,000 counters.

I love the HQ system much better than the card system of Rommel in the Desert and the options you have to blitz, mobilize and utilize air power.

The scenarios are well done and let you play the campaign in bite sized pieces.

I'm not into the whole Front-based WWII system, but if you are, the idea of putting all of them together is a good idea for the monster gamers.

The combat system is simple without being too simple, which is true for the entire game.

Columbia's three best games are Julius Caesar, Rommel in the Desert, and Eastfront.

I love east front games. I can't comment too strongly on this game except it did not play well to simulate the warfare on this front.

From supplies to HQ activation shows that the war was done with 'control of resources in an unrealistic way'. Resource needed seem to be only diverted to certain fronts, causing the other fronts to 'freeze in motion completely'.

A new way to handle such a large front but unrealistic in game play or historical feel.

The game stagnates late 1942, becoming a fist fight after that as everyone is husbanding resources.

Lots of wargaming goodness to enjoy here! Plenty of tough decisions as you decide which units to activate and where to fight or where to push harder even though your units are wearing out. Units are all tied to HQs so you can't just move everyone and fight everywhere, only where you have the HQ steps! Makes for some nice, meaty choices. The rules are a tad long (25+ pages) but there are lots of examples and everything is spelled out fairly clearly. Scenarios run about 5 hours on average so it's easy to fit one into a long afternoon.

I have mixed feelings about this game, a bit due to the depressing look of the game. It has been a great game - and a very innovative one - in its days and actually still is. However I miss a command structure like in Gettysburg. Apart from setup Army Groups North, Central and South mix up and headquarters can command any unit. Apart from that I don't like the way headquarterrange is determined. That could be more sophisticated.

If the Germans keep their headquarters together you can almost blitz any gameturn on one point in the front. Use them like a fist and push to Moscow. The Soviets must then give up the south, run and pray for an early winter. However I've found this recently discovered strategy rather non-historical, where three German army groups are pushing into the Soviet Union.

Regarding the 1st edition:  Slightly smaller map than EFII, and some minor rule changes.  If you aren't planning on hooking up with Eurofront, this might be the way to go.

One of the big advantages is that the map is turned sideways.  For EastFront II, you need a table at least 34" wide to fit the board.

They nailed it! A simply superb game unrivalled in its ability to capture on a corps/army scale the thematic historicity of the war in the East. There are so many brilliant subtleties in its mechanisms - hex control, river repulse, supply attrition, step-loss reduction, HQ command/combat support, two-week player turns - which abstract nuanced detail and historical realism without drowning in logistical minutiae.
Elegance in a box!

Before Eastfront, the last time I played a block game was many moons ago with Waterloo. As a devoted "hex & counter" wargamer, I have found Eastfront to be an excellent game. I have played Fire in the East/Scorched Earth, and Army Group South, all amazing divisional level games of warfare on the Eastern Front. The jury is still out as to how "realistic" Eastfront is as a portrayal of the Russian campaign. But each time I play it, I get a better appreciation for the subtle touches the designers put into this game. I give it a "10," not because it is a perfect game--no such animal exist. I give it this high rank because of the overall experience and enjoyment. After a few rounds with Eastfront, you get a better understanding of the critical importance of supplying an armygroup on the march. Campaigns ebb and flow as the supplies wax and wane. A few quick quirks in passing: given all the effort put into creating such a colourful and detailed map, what were they thinking when they made the map squares so small? It is difficult enough to fit four blocks in, but try having eight fight an extended battle. And as fine--and they are fine--as the wooden blocks are, the historical order of battle seems to fade into red and black squares where the individual strengths and weaknesses of units are lost in a bland conformity. There are a few more bones to pick, but there is much to admire and appreciate in EastFront.

This game doesn't show it's age at all, even though it is 16 years old by now.

In the class of medium-complexity wargames, this game is without peer. You've got truly nail-grinding tension as there is so much hidden information. You've got decision-making at a good, euro-game like level with little micro-management and almost no fiddlyness. You've got clean rules with essentially zero extranneous garbage. You've got scenarios of reasonable length. You've got a wide variety of scenarios, from the desperate ('41 and '45) to the tightly-matched clash of titans ('42). The pace of the game is perfect. You've got critical decisions to make at the tactical (managing hexside limits, techniques of cracking defensive positions), operational (where to spend valuable HQ steps), and strategic (how to spend production). You've got a great, realistic historical feel. Individual scenarios are quite satisfying, or you can link them into much larger games. And you can combine the whole thing with West and MedFront.

All in all, I'm hard-pressed to figure out what more you could ask for in a (war)game. Maybe you'd like some sort of card mechanism to add the variability of political events to add a little more strategic depth, but there are legitimate reasons for not trying this (WWII:Barbarossa to Berlin, despite its many charms, could sometimes seem like a bit of a mish-mash in this respect).

The game play takes some getting used to but seems to really give a feel of what it was like to coordinate armies on the eastern front. Two nit-noids ...

   One of the best military-themed games ever produced.  Challenging, exciting, and yet very "playable".  Much of this courtesy of the blocks.

If you want to start WWII wargaming on strategic scale - get this game! It simulates the whole conflict on the eastern front from 1941-1945 on corps/army level. Easy to learn with an introductory scanario, difficult to master! High replay value, because every scenario can be set up individually. It perfectly incorporates four basic principles of war: weather, terrain, command ability and supply attrition. Plays in about 5 hours per scenario (each scenario consits of 6 months). Uses wooden blocks instead of counters which stand upright. By this way, enemy unit strength remains hidden!
It`s simplicity (compared to other wargames) makes it shine. GET IT!

This is the best of the block games which I have played so far.  The rules are well written, the use of HQ's clever, the length of play manageable and the tension always runs high.

The ho-hum production values are my only complaint (Pacific Victory-like counter art would have been nice).

RATING: 8
A game definitely ahead of its time. The first WW2 East Front game that used fog of war and attrition. So far this has proven to be the best East Front game that I've played.

Too many hex & counter East Front games are highly brittle owing to the fact that they don't seem to model attrition at all and/or because of the satellite-level intelligence that's provided to both players. The Germans lost 1/4 of their force in the first 5 months of the conflict. How many supposed simulations model that? Not many. Here the Germans actually get dinged a bit.

In this game you get a real sense of the Germans pushing as hard as they can without the feeling that the Russians could collapse at any moment in the first summer. Yes, they'll be strained, but I've never seen the Russians fold in 1941, unlike just about every traditional hex & counter game on the subject that usually degenerates into "ZOC chess".

The mechanics are sound, the attrition makes sense, and the HQ and air rules are all well integrated. About the worst I can say about this game is that the VP conditions for the individual scenarios are on the wonky side, since you end up choosing to play for the long term or play for the win. I choose to basically ignore the VP conditions and play for the long term fun.

I definitely prefer this over Blocks in the East, far more reward for less effort.

Since I rated RitD a 10, it's not surprising that EF would not be anything less. Craig Besinque's hallmark is his ability to integrate logistics into the game system without using onerous rules. Yet through this integration of logistics, his games are really taken to the next level of wargaming. 

Beyond just being a typical Russian Front game of manoeuvre and attack/defence (and these elements are well incorporated into EF), players must also handle the logistics element in EF. One complaint I've heard in EF is that you can't blitz all the time in EF! Doh! That's totally missing the point about logistics management. EF is a game that requires skill to play well. Players must know when to blitz, when to manoeuvre for position, manoeuvre for attack and deploy their HQs. On top of all this, the block 'fog of war' system creates a very tense and exciting game in addition to being a very deep and challenging game.

Excellent block game on the Eastern Front from Columbia games.

Excellent production values. Excellent, simple but subtle play. Playable within a few hours to a day or two for the campaign game.

While looking simple and easy to play, it accurately portrayed the situation on the Eastern front during world war 2 in a play with subtelties enough to satisy a grognard.

I especially liked the use of HQs to command units and airpower. 

The Germans start powerful(with more up to strengh units and armored units and much better airpower but are hampered by lower production levels than the Soviets and much more expensive units(to buy or raise). The Soviets while numerous start with mostly an infantry army with some tank and mechanized units but they are aided by advantages in weather and cheaper to buy and build units as well as a huge territory to pull back to and better production levels.

And what I especially liked about it is that its replayable and a nail biter up to the end.

The only niggle I have is that it is also heavilly dependent on good die rolls using the bucket of dice system(rolling 6s hits etc.) but it does not mar the fun of the game(actually helps it).

Highly recomended and fun to play.

Only played a couple of times, but there were several points that turned my interest to other games:

- 6 month scenarios are not that interesting to me (prefer the whole sweep of a campaign), and the entire campaign would be very long.

- the hexes aren't big enough for the stacking limits.

- on Barbarossa, at least, you must play a very a-historical strategy (single thrust on one front with all HQ's) just to match history.

- while the mechanics are sound game-wise, are they really sound historically?  With Hammer of the Scots, it doesn't matter a great deal if the results are less than historical because the game is short - investing 40 hours in monster is another story.

ultimately sold.

RATING: 9
Excellent: Strategic - EastFront - Light/Medium

See EastFrontII comments.

Plus:
-The best playable 41-45 Eastern Front game outthere 
-Loads of interesting scenario's that can be played again, again and again. Ever getting tired of Barbarossa or Summer '42?
-Brilliant HQ system: so simple yet so clever 
-Very accessible and highly replayable

Minus:
-Not evocative due to the blocks and lack of chrome
-Components are functional. Board and Blocks could have been pimped a bit.

General comments:
Better than WestFront but in conjunction with it, EPIC. Playable and a more realistic simulation of the Eastern Front than the blocks might believe you to. 
I have hardly came a ccross a game that is so clean as Eastfront. No exceptions or errata and still extremely close to reality. 

An art of genious to accomplish so much by saying so little. Pure, clean, accessible, replayable, exciting, all you would ever want from a wargame.   
Of all games, this I played most should I fall blind one day, I will still be ble to play Barbarossa... 

See review.

Captures the feel of the Eastern front very well. Concisely written rules with sufficient detail for depth without unnecessary chrome.

The HQ blocks work brilliantly to model blitzkrieg tactics.

Managed to pick up a copy of this from a fellow BGGer. Have read lots of good things about it and decided that given limitations of space and that I am probably unlikely to ever want to play a mega Eurofront game that this was my best option. For me the subject matter is certainly of interest so  I am looking forward to some tense fighting!

Have now played a couple of times and the game is really begining to grow on me. Been the Soviets three times in the Barbarossa Campaign. Have learned to roll with the punches so to speak!

24/09/11 added the Volga Front Map to the set following a successful trade during the Euro Math Trade for September. Arrived today and looks good. Will try this out on the next play!

RATING: 9
Very impressive design. Simulates the Great Patriotic War very nicely. Players face the same sorts of decisions as their historical counterparts. Inherent play imbalance is ameliorated by Victory Point handicaps.

My only complaints are: this game takes a very long time to play; the 4 hour playing time listed is for one scenario! The whole game can easily last 18 hours! Also, the Germans can bunch up their HQs in Summer 1941, artificially creating a rampaging "Blob" of panzers which are virtually unstoppable. A "gentleman's agreement" must be reached before play begins that the German player will not resort to this gamey tactic.

Those two quibbles aside, this is a fantastic game!

After reading the rulebook twice I was [i]really[/i] excited to play, it looked like an amazing game that could really be a real favorite, then I played "Kursk", don't do that. It is suggested to possibly play this first in the rulebook since both sides are fairly equal, which is true and likely historic, it just makes it fairly boring overall its just one big front line war of attrition, the game went to what I thought would be a 9 to like a 6 or 7 most. My biggest disappointment came from the fact that when Reading the rules I thought there would be many opportunities for creative, strategic and even sneaky devious moves but in practice again it was just one big line down the center of the board, so play was mostly entirely tactical. Then I played Barbarossa...

Now in Barbarossa I played the Germans, and boy playing the Germans in Summer '41 is a lot of fun! Here you have some very interesting decisions on all levels, and especially once things start breaking open too wow, and the creative sneaky moves to come into play here too good stuff. Consequently and unfortunately, I don't think playing the Russians is much fun, challenging for sure, but not much fun you  take a real beating and are forced to cower at times. So the slightly disappointing thing here for me is you really should play a full year (this is suggested also) to give both players a "taste of the good stuff" so to speak, both get to be aggressors and then defenders, this is a 12 hour game (vs 6 for just 6 months). Another thing about Barbarossa is the VP conditions are definitely off if just playing the 6 months, many people have noted this, unfortunately I don't see where someone recommended a better VP total and after only playing it twice I'm not sure what it should be either yet.  

As for the game itself, I really like the rules overall, there is a fair bit of 'streamlined chrome' here(almost no exceptions), and the rulebook is very tight for a wargame. Rules are also very logical/intuitive/reaslistic overall as well, so even though there are 27 pages or so, it reads more like 18 or 20 and pretty easy to get through if you have played other wargames (esp block games) so really not that hard to learn contrary to what I first thought. Also very important to mention I think here, is the rules melt into background (where they belong) fairly quickly after playing so you can focus on "your game" not the game. HQ rules deserve special mention, instead of allowing all forces to move which can be cumbersome in some games, players have to make tough choices on which units to activate with the limited HQ's they have, and there are some other nice touches here pertaining to HQ's like airstrikes, rail movement etc. Cities did seem to be ruled too strong along with Fortresses, while you can cut some of them off it would be nice to viably attack some too but here the attacker is really at a little too much of a disadvantage I think. Buckets of dice works, and likely evens out usually, and all the other usual wargame stuff is here like Supply, ZOC's, rail, terrain etc with some cool stuff thrown in too like Para, optional sea movement/supply and more. One component complaint, hexes are too small with constant overcrowding and should have been 25% bigger or so, worst part they did NOT correct this in the 2nd ed, instead they made the map way bigger and left hexes the same size. 

So overall I really like EF, and I think its a top notch wargame (less some scenario and VP nitpicks) that maybe should be rated 8.5 and could end up 9 most for me but after playing 3 times I'm thinking it's not going to be the favourite for me I thought it would be when reading the reviews and then rules twice. Note I am biased more towards CDW like POG, Hannibal etc and I really should try playing another scenario next time (if not a full year) and should play the defender to see if its as unfun as it looks (I do enjoy a challenge though, but I want a win to shoot for too and with unbalanced VP's Barbarossa was not doable for Germans) I'm also actually wondering if I might enjoy Pacific Victory a little more (with a couple tweaks like Victory conditions for one) because it will likely be a little more dynamic with fighting in Sea, Air and land (note though I am also biased towards the PTO)

RATING: 10
There are dozens of games that cover this most popular of campaigns, but EasFront is easily the best.  It focuses on what&#039;s important, abstracts what wasn&#039;t, and puts players on a gaming thrill-ride with the fog-of-war induced by the block system.  Tremendous back-and-forth with lots of strategic options and tough tactical decision-making.  Perhaps best, however, is how this game neatly and elegantly puts logistics front-and-center with the HQ units.  Playing this game is like experiencing the Hagler-Hearns fight - ferocious, hair-raising, and a once-in-a-lifetime game experience.  While the rules may look a bit overwhelming at first to non-wargamers, they work sensibly and are far easier to digest than you&#039;d think.  No gamer should pass this one up!

I'm conflicted what to think about EastFront. On the one hand, it's a brillant design. It's the first non-card-driven wargame I come across whose gameplay interests me. None of the counting to get one more modifier, to reach the next row on the table. With comparably simple rules, a great depth is created by the intertwining systems of production, movement, combat and supply. The central HQ system is a great idea. Where other wargames focusing on the simulation part fail for me, EastFront succeeds as a game while still modelling the conflict.

Nonetheless, it's too long, too ponderous and too exhausting to get regular play. It would benefit greatly from playing it with an experienced gamer who takes care of all the small details and knows the ropes - how to tackle this fortress, how to set the targets right, where to fight, where to go for the supply lines and where to use these rare Supreme HQ moves.

As a design it's at least an '8', my personal enjoyment for now without a deeper grip on the system is a '6'. A '7' it shall be then.

Excellent block game which provides great narative with so few rules.

Gameplay is tense, scenarios feel very different. So Barbarossa is completely different to late war scenarios. Craig has to be applauded that engine of this game is able to handle both of these extremes without long special rules.

Why not give higher rating?
I am somehow missing some events or other aspects than pure fighting. I also find rather strange system than conquering of some front city will immediately increase your productions capabilities, etc...

But overall this is great game.

Played once, 1943 scenario.  The blocks give a little fog of war, but basically, this is a so-so eastern front game.  It doesn't provide the same tension as hex-and-counter games like War Without Mercy or even Defiant Russia.  I think maybe the block gimmick detracts somewhat from the strategy of where to commit your forces for me.

I'm not at all interested in the conflict being depicted (Hitler vs. Stalin, hooray for the... good guys?) but [b]this is a fun game.[/b]  Moreso than with other wargames, I find myself thinking a lot between games about how I'll set up next time, which part of the front I'll focus on, etc.  Also, I really like the supply rules, which let you damage enemy units just by making good moves.  The rules can appear daunting, but they're not that bad (fewer pages of rules than Axis & Allies... and the important ones make sense).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
While not a perfect simulation, in relation to the rules density and ease of play it pretty much is. The agony of decision making based on limited information is constant, and the way command control is modeled forces you to tough decisions throughout with the HQ step losses and limited rebuildability. Nice selection of scenarios, with both sides having to take turns as the offender. The perfect weight wargame for my tastes.

Upgraded to version II, this one given away in the European Wargame Chain of Generosity.

A fantastic WW2 game where you play out scenarios on the Eastfront.  It's a great game and isn't too complex.  The rules are well done and the blocks are used to great advantage for fog of war and step reduction.  Headquarters are activated instead of individual units.  There are 9 scenarios in EF and another 6 scenarios in Volga Front.

Though the rules are simple I'm ranking this as Medium weight just because there is so much going on.

Better (maybe) than Bobby Lee or Sam Grant; definitely better than HotS; about equal to Gettysburg; I guess the rules were easier to comprehend after taking in four other Columbia games; but there are enough differences to make rule-checking a bit more frequent than I would like; more after more plays.

After playing GMT and AH (old school) games, I find that Columbia's are a bit lacking. Combining combat reinforcements with Command & Control just doesn't seem to work all that well.

Excellent game.  This one ranks right up there with the classic (for its time) The Russian Campaign by Avalon Hill.  Eastfront's HQ system really works at painlessly simulating the role of logistics, and rolls in well with the fog of war created by the blocks.  This one's a classic.  Be wary though that Eastfront's excellent system does not transfer over too well for its' siblings Westfront and Medfront.  For a European theatre-wide game I'd recommend going with Europe Engulfed instead.

Where do I begin? The map is too small to hold the units and the artwork is confusing. The rulebook is poorly written and leaves out way too many things that would make playing the game easier, especially in the area of setting up the scenarios. The gameplay is fiddly and repetitive and as luck-filled as Memoir '44 when it comes to combat. I really don't get why this game is so revered - it's unlikely I would ever want to play this again unless it's with with someone that can show me the error of my way of thinking and show this game's hiddden (to me) appeal.

Blocks are entertaining but limited intelligence at this scale actually decrease realism. With a few large hexes, very limited "tactical" options and no operational feel. Significantly, gamers who are not interested in WW2 love this game, probably because it is so abstract.

After several plays of this game both stand-alone and in the full "Front" game, I've decided that it is not good enough to warrant regular play.  While the game does have some merit on its own, when placed into the full "Front" game it really becomes a mess of rules that can turn the game into little more than a book-keeping exercise.
 
  Because of this, I have traded away or sold all components from this series.

EastFront is an excellent choice for starting wargamers. It has the 'Stratego effect' of hidden pieces, some economy, building units, but most of all very simple combat and movement rules. Despite the simple rules, a lot of different strategies are possible. The only negative I have to say about the game is that cities are too strong defensively and that a freak dice-roll can cause a disasterous breakthrough you weren't counting on or prevent a breakthrough that should have been a given.

The continuous blitz strategy for the Germans in S41 is a bit cheesy and outright unrealistic with respect to speed of advance. A houserule of converting railroads like in Russian Front fixes that. However, the beauty of the game is that also that blob strategy is stoppable. The game is sort of a paper-scissors-rock game, any strategy can be countered!

The Barbarossa S41 scenario is the most fun especially if you give the Rusky a chance to have a go by playing W41 as well. I'd say the Russians are the most difficult to master, especially a good defense in S41. An efficient German advance with not too many stragglers is an art too. Plenty in this game for rookies as well as experienced wargamers.

As East Front simulations go, you can't ask for a more enjoyable game. There is some crowding in the hexes. The game does a good job simulating the historical campaign and offers some shorter scenarios. Not knowing what you're attacking with the hidden blocks doesn't have a lot of meaning since you have to keep moving forward, no matter what as the German, but it can be used as a bluff.

It takes a few scenarios to become familiar with the game since certain campaigns don't necessarily have to deal with all aspects of the rules. Kursk, for example, has little to do with supply problems etc. Still an excellent game.

Good block game.  Campaign is long but scenarios are good - about 4 hours.  Some of the hardest decisions are the economic ones - spend your points on headquarters (for future actions) or on troops for passive defence?  I prefer Rommel in the Desert which feels less attritiony, as buying back headquarters points each turn seems a bit inelegant.

RATING: 8
Great fog-of-war from the block system, the battles have interesting tactical nuances, and the HQ/command system is challenging and realistic. After being out of the wargame hobby for over 10 years, this was the first game I played upon returning. Rapidly becoming a classic, if it isn't one already.

Takes a game or two to get your head around, and some may not be inclined to spend the time on the learning curve.  Real depth becomes evident by second or third game.  Feels very different from most east front games, with a congested board stuffed with blocks and lots of attritional battles.

The best Eastern Front game I know.  Beautiful supply rules, rivers are very interesting, movement works well, the HQ/blitz system is great, plus of course you get the cool blocks for limited intelligence.  Absolutely classic.

I have to rate this game high because it was my first introduction to block games years ago and I've been hooked ever since.  Thank you Columbia and Craig for a great game.  I've been tempted to purchase the updated version, but sadly I don't think I can find anyone to regulalry play.

After one playing, I can see what the fuss is about. It's a wargame that never forgets that it's a GAME. No unnecessary chrome, and the blocks are such a magnificent example of useful simplicity.

RATING: 8
Probably the best of Columbia&#039;s block games.  Doesn&#039;t rely on the tactical battle board like so many of their other games, and captures all aspects of, well, the east front in WWII.  Airpower is abstracted (just fine by me), but the real beauty of the game is the elegant way logistics are handled - players must be conscious of the resuply cycle, which is not even a consideration in many games at this unit scale (corps/army).  The combat system is heavy on dice rolling, and I think it doesn&#039;t quite hit the mark in a realism sense (armour needs to be just a bit more powerful, but there&#039;s no way to roll a &#039;2.5&#039; on a D6), though I can easily live with that drawback.

2 plays. This is a lengthy brainburner which requires some serious learning of mechanics. The front doesn't seem to move very quickly at all, but you do get a good feel for the grinding bloodbath that was the Eastern Front.

Too complicated for most folks, I'd pass it by unless you've fallen in love with the theme or other easier blockgames first.

A really good, low-complexity game about the WWII east front. Excellent rules, good components and great replayability. Highly recommended

RATING: 8.5
Oh man,is this game delicious.  It is so easy for 8 hours to disapear playing this as the Germans trudge their way across Russia while the Ruskies hope for mud.  This game really takes some of the best stuff from Bobby Lee and streamlines it into a simple head to head bashfest. 

The pricey steps for the Germans make the quagmire of winter really painful (as it should be).  Moscow is such a temptation, but I really think that taking the south is a solid objective.  I can't wait to play this more.

Used to love these block games and owned several of them including this one but after actually playing them, I find them to be completely unsatisfying. I am not a hardcore wargamer, and did find the rules easy enough, but the combat left me flat. We played for four hours and nothing seemed to really happen, year after year....

Excellent game. I like the first one more than EFII because the map is smaller the hexes are bigger, and the placement is on the block. What a great East fron game. Plays pretty quick too once you get going on it. I have two copies not sure if that's enough!

This is a cComplex block wargame.  

Plan on allotting a lot of time, space and mental energy to this game.  It has great playing wooden pieces, well-written rules, and a series of scenarios that can be played either as (relatively) quick games, or as a long-lasting campaign game.  

This is a fantastic game, but it is not easy to get in and out of.  Plan to spend all day with this one, or to keep it set up for several sessions, especially for your first game.  

The subtleties of this game keep appearing like magic.  Painful magic.

I finally got to play this one. I played the Russians in the summer of '43. Supply lines and HQ are key. I would like to give this one a try again soon before I forget some of the things I learned from his game.
Things I did wrong: poor initial troop placement, I didn't make a few good armies

Things I learned : it takes a lot to knock out an army in a city or heavy terrain

I really didn't like the size of the map as the blocks are all very tight and it makes it very hard to see the surrounding terrain as well as to move without knocking stuff down. This game would definitely benefit from a much bigger hex.

Great game, though I've barely explored it.  Loads of interesting choices, and the HQ mechanic is brilliant.  It's funny how you always think your opponent is just a little (or a lot) better off than he is.

But like all wargames, hard to get on the table, and requires an invested opponent.

only half a play so far. liked what i saw, but seemed quite different to other wargames insofaras opponents OOS units were removed off the board during your turn..there's a lot to take in as far as terrain features, organising your troops etc but that will come i hope..2nd game (after a refresher tutorial a previous afternoon) we played the citadel scenario. I think we grasped the majority of rules fairly well, apart from a few minor and a few major (like we mucked up what happens in mud quite a bit) but enough for my playing partner to go 'right, next time, I know what I'll do different!'
It's a great wargames, but alas, like most of the wargames in my collection, takes some time to play and so won't come out as often as the Eurogames. Still, I like it, enought to finally rate it, and give it an 8.
My second play..we spent an afternoon going through the tutorial scenario and me clarifying points to my newbie wargamer as we progress through it. A week later we played the '43 scenario and all went well until we come across mud *again*..we mucked up the rules enough to have to call it quits..some points we got wrong..
1. restrictions of movement of units.
2. air raids was only SF should have been DF
I had managed to cut off supply to a huge soviet group but the mucked up the movement during mud weather so my super move became nul and void..sigh..This is a cracker of a game, and both of us are wanting more. Next game should be over the Christmas break..looking forward to it (I think I'll be Russian next time...)

It's a very clean, clear system with just enough fog of war and many apparent choices as to how to proceed for each side.  Each scenario plays in about 2 hours.

I've played most of the scenarios and they each have interesting things for each side to do, but I have no idea how to get the Germans their historical progress in the Barbarossa scenario.

Looking forward to many more plays.

RATING: 8
Still not played how much I wanted to (6 games including tutorials). The game is actually not very difficult to learn; supply lines need some analysis at first, but then become quiet obvious. This game erases my bad memories of the past AH wargames; it'simple to handle but with lot of strategy: nice trade-off. Unfortunately the map it's not big enough: occasionally you will have some problems fitting 8 blocks in an exagon with a side of 2cm! So you have to move the blocks out of the map befere resolving combat. Another interesting note: playing time states 4-6 hours; well, it never took me more than 3 hours to complete a scenario!

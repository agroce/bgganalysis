Love it, love it, love it.  I had a feeling that it would be good, but not this good!  Nice quick game that you'll want to play again as soon as you finish.  Well balanced in terms of luck factor (which is always a bug bear of mine) and deep strategy, yet easy to learn rules - brilliant.  Kudas Fantasy Flight you've created an instant classic.

I was surprised how fun I had. The realy big problem is: You must buy many little expansion to add the full possibilities. I'm one of these guys who think: the dice have no more influence, as the list and player skill. 

Now its 2017: X-WIng is a big part of my life. I played it thousands of times. I organized many tournaments and be a part of a strong community. Search for "Dalli" in the German community...

RATING: 2
Too expensive, too random, and way too long for a game so dependent on dice rolls. I really hate the special abilities, they bog down the game and make it frustrating. I might enjoy it a little bit, rating it in the 5 to 6 range if there was more emphasis on maneuvering the ships and none of the special pilot abilities and extra upgrades. Also I hate the figurines, which are essentially just chrome, they could be abstractly represented by a cardboard token or just a card for that matter for a fraction of the price.

Better than the Wizkids versions, this is the consummate Star Wars gaming experience. The quality of the figures is exceptional, the organised play (should you choose to participate) is outstanding, but even just as a two player game out of the box it lives up to the hype.  Adding more ships enhances the experience, and the larger ships add new missions and augmentations that greatly add to the replay value.

Ignore all the 2D physics and any depiction of "maneuvering and combat in space" and you will have a good time flying the spacecraft from the movies and immersing yourself in the Star Wars universe. 
For me, anything more than 3 or 4 ships per side and the game slows to an unacceptable pace. Too fiddly and too crowded for any fun. Just my 2 cents!

RATING: 7
Delightful in every way. I was a fan of Wings of War and this theme is far more enjoyable. The miniatures is what makes this incredible. But the game play is smartly easy. It is typical to rush a game - its so easy to move and attack, you find yourself often not planning much and crashing into each other. And that's not even a bad strategy if you have enough low-cost ships. Anyhow, I've sunk alot into the miniatures which admittedly might be fairly priced for the quality, but still can be very expensive. But whatever. Love it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun for non-serious gaming. You just can't keep the minis in their exact place all the time and that's just the reason why this game shouldn't be taken too seriously. Just let the dice fly and have fun.

My main game for sure. Can't stop playing really, even competitively. Great rules set, many upgrade options, superb components, high replayability, etc. Since it's dice-based though, the luck factor can be quite high sometimes. But it usually evens out over many games. The community of players is awesome and a big part of the fun is the squad-building itself.

Pretty fun for a miniatures game (of which I'm not usually a fan).  It's not a deep game (at least, not in a way that is interesting to me), but it is so strong with the theme that I enjoy it every once in a while.  The gameplay is solid, easy to understand, and interesting (for a while).

Another fantastic game by Fantasy Flight.  Although it is very competitive and offers an array of expansions in the form of various ships.  The game is split into three factions: Rebels, Imperials, and Scum and Villany.  Each faction has their pros and cons.  My main faction for this game is the S&V faction, flying the Firespray (Slave I).  You can outfit your ships with a variety of different cards, although, some cards might not be available in expansions for your particular faction.  So you will need to buy an expansion even though you can't use the ship in your fleet.  Otherwise a great game.

RATING: 8
Simple, entertaining, and quick, with excellent production values. The business model is cash-grabby, but the game itself is quite fun.

You FEEL like you're in an X-Wing or TIE fighter, swooshing around in space, blasting your opponent. The components are excellent, the miniatures look BEAUTIFUL, the rules are simple, straightforward, well-explained, and well-realized, and the game just works! If you're a Star Wars fan, this is a definite buy.

The gameplay is pretty fun, but the monetization strategy of this game killed it for me. I picked up two core sets on clearance and it was barely enough to get an interesting game out of it.

It reminds me of [thing=22532]Wings of War[/thing] but the maneuver sticks are better than the cards by far.  The plastic, the theme, and the dice...so Ameri-Trashy.  Ain't life grand?
Yeah, those ships can't perform those maneuvers in space, but ya know what?  They weren't supposed to do that in the movie, either, so this was following the same flawed premise, and did it nicely.  I like it: especially the maneuver thingies that you hide/reveal and the focus/evade/barrel roll idea.

Świetna gra w uniwersum Gwiezdnych Wojen, ale spodoba się ona również i osobom których nie miały z sagą nigdy do czynienia.
Świetnie wykonane modele oraz bardzo dobre malowanie figurek. Bardzo ładnie prezentują się na biurku. 
Jeden podstawowy zestaw bardzo szybko przestaje wystarczać osobom które złapią bakcyla. Posiadanie dwóch podstawek jest raczej naturalną sytuacją dla każdego gracza więc problem braku wystarczającej liczby kości szybko przestaje istnieć.
Gorąco polecam i radze uważać na swój portfel, bo gra strasznie szybko zaczyna wyciągać z niego dodatkowe pieniążki :)

I played this game just once, so these are mostly impressions that may change after multiple plays.

I'm not a fan of miniature games. I tried a couple but I always found them too long, too expensive and too boring because of all the dice rolling. X-Wing kinda surprised me instead.

The biggest strength of this system is its simplicity. It's quite easy to play and you don't have to rely on convoluted charts or long calculations to determine hits and damages. This leaves a lot of space for tactical and strategical decisions. The second biggest strength of the game is its strong theme. The movement in particular feels very "realistic" and gives you the feel of piloting a spaceship quite a bit.

On the other hand, I'm still not that big a fan... but it's merely for personal tastes. I recognize the merits of this title, but it's still a bit too long for me and it has too much dice rolling. Also the personalization of your army didn't excite me as much as I expected. Maybe with additional plays in the future my opinion might change.

To sum up: Good system, easy to understand and very thematic. Still not my cup of tea.

FAVOURITE GAME - An excellent tactical ship-to-ship combat game based on the Star Wars universe. You either choose to play with the Rebel Alliance or the Galactic Empire. The gameplay is quite easy: you secretly plan you moves and then execute them together with any special actions available. The combat is more or less a question of luck, as you roll dice, although having some option to modify the results. The starter set does not confer an epic feel to the game, but if you choose to upgrade your fleet by buying units it becomes awesome.

1st Play: This game felt a lot like wings of war, which make sense given they're the same system. The pacing feels off, with a round of combat followed by 2 rounds of maneuvering just to have another round of misses. The miniatures and production are top notch, the game just isn't as smooth as I would like. I'm also not a miniatures player, so I might not be the right audience for this. 

No 2nd play: Not that I'll never give this game a chance, but I'm not enough of a Star wars fan (or any mini's game) to really get into a system like this. It's well produced and the theme is excellent, just not for me.

Slick. 

Everything about this is a promise fulfilled in terms of the big-company, big-license game. Finally FFG gets the little things right: the rules are finally at-standard, the fans get their 'realism' and the game doesn't drown in superfluous components. 

The game is just fun, fun, fun. It's accessible (which Wings of War is not, strangely). It's fast (not only a 20-30 minute game, but turns move fast). It's got enough skill and granularity to keep you interested. 

Unfortunately, I gave up on it when it seemed like you needed a tonne of ships and playspace to make the to-and-fro interesting. If you want a customisable minis game, I think this is worth it, but if you want an affordable board game, might be too much $$$.

A very good remix version of wings of war. The minis are really great looking and decent in size. 

Game play is easy for both beginners and some complexity for intermediate gamers alike.

Like Wings, this game suffers a bit from the 2D-3D space representation. In that sense, the game lack that dimension to move those ships in combat.

As a wave by wave collectable, it makes the spending less painful.

Good introductory game

The rules, minis, collect-ability are all amazing.

I always wanted some ships as a collector but was really surprised how good the game is.
My only gripe against it is bad (from gamer perspective) supporting card packaging. Cards that suplement your ships are most often in packages with completely different ships (good for company business bad for end users).
But if you are non-tournament player just forget about the cards and print the rules from the net.

Its worth it.

Επιτραπέζιο παιχνίδι με μινιατούρες από την Fantasy Flight Games στο στυλ του κλασσικού Wings of War. Αρχικά να πω πως οι μινιατούρες είναι prepainted και φαίνεται να είναι καλής ποιότητας και πιστά αντίγραφα των σκαφών αν και δεν είμαι ειδικός επί του θέματος. 

Οι κανόνες είναι πολύ απλοί και λειτουργικοί. Ο κάθε παίκτης διαλέγει ταυτόχρονα και κρυφά τι κίνηση θέλει να κάνει το κάθε σκάφος του. Μετά με την σειρά το κάθε σκάφος κινείτε χρησιμοποιώντας το αντίστοιχο template (ξεχάστε hexes και μεζούρες) και επιλέγει ένα action. Αφού κινηθούν όλα τα σκάφη μετά αρχίζει η μάχη και ρίχνουμε τα ζάρια. 

Στο ταμπλό μπορούμε να τοποθετήσουμε και μετεωρίτες για εμπόδια, ενώ τα σκάφη είναι κάπως παραμετροποιήσημα αφού μπορούμε να επιλέξουμε τον εξοπλισμό που θα φέρουν. Σκοπός είναι να καταρρίψεις όλα τα αντίπαλα σκάφη αλλά υπάρχουν στους κανόνες και 2-3 σενάρια με διαφορετικά objectives.

Μου άρεσε που το παιχνίδι έχει γρήγορο ρυθμό και καταφέρνει να σου περάσει την αίσθηση του να πιλοτάρεις ένα σκάφος. Είναι πολύ διασκεδαστικό και αν έχεις περισσότερα σκάφη τότε μπορείς εύκολα να παίξεις και με περισσότερους από 2 παίκτες. Το μόνο αρνητικό είναι πως το βασικό σετ είναι περισσότερο σαν demo του πραγματικού παιχνιδιού. Για να φτιάξεις ένα πραγματικό στόλο χρειάζεται να πάρεις 2-3 ακόμα σκάφη. Παράλληλα θα ανοίξουν και οι επιλογές από κάρτες εξοπλισμού.

Όμορφο, απλό, γρήγορο, και εθιστικό. Δεν ξέρω όμως πόσες παρτίδες θα σας βγάλει το βασικό σετ προτού χρειαστείτε το κάτι παραπάνω.

2 core sets, with Force Awakens core set, Most Wanted, Imperial Aces, Rebel Aces, Millennium Falcon, Tie Advanced, Tie Phantom, Tie Bomber, E Wing, 2x Tie Defender, Lambda Shuttle, Inquisitor's Tie, Ghost, Tie Fighter, Z-95 Headhunter, Y Wing, B wing, T70 X wing, Decimator, YT-2400, K Wing and Slave 1 packs. 

36 ships. Hopefully I'm done. Fingers crossed Fantasy flight are going to back up their word re: supporting casual play - I'd love to see some heavily playtested new official formats restricting squadron building, or, say, a nice hefty hardcover containing the rules and dozen missions for a complete narrative-driven, RPG-esque campaign, like so much of the community has had a shot at.

I finally succumbed to X-Wing at about the time the Imperial Aces were released. Foolishly, I bought the core set for my brother’s birthday and we played it together. Then we played it again. Then again. And then again.

There have been few games in recent memory that have had such an immediately positive impact on me. It’s so simple; it’s so neat and logical; it’s so fun and thematic. There and then at the table we each agreed to sink a silly amount of money into buying more of these expensive little plastic ships.

That said, I don’t feel that X-Wing is offensively overpriced either. I’ve often been put off many other miniature games I’d probably love by the prohibitively expensive costs of starting the hobby. But here I don't feel ripped off when I pay around £11 or 12 for an "expansion pack".

X Wing also gets plus points from me because I detest painting models – and I think these ships are far nicer looking than the Star Trek (and now D&D Attack Wing) stuff from WizKids.

The ridiculous part of all this is that I’m not actually a very big Star Wars fan – though it might always have been the rabid, lunatic fans that put me off the franchise rather than the films themselves.

Anyway, in short, this game is insane. Stay the hell away from it if you have disposable income you’d like to keep in your pockets.

One noticeable downside is that it can actually take quite a bit of effort to get it on the table and playing when you have plenty of different ships if you don't invest in decent ways to organise your X-wing gear.

See Attack Wing above for the comparison.  What I'll say about X-Wing is it does have fantastic miniatures, and does a good job of emulating spaceship dog fighting.  For this reason I continue to buy both in tandem and my display space of tiny spaceships is rapidly overcrowding.

Only got it recently, but this is already by far my favourite miniatures game. The ships are gorgeously painted, and it is much cheaper than something like Warhammer. Only complaints with the core game are that the movement dials sometimes seem like they could be a little better designed, and that after playing the base set you immediately want to get more ships! 
All told, if you like Star Wars or wargames, this is a must buy!

Nice light strategy/tactical game. Rules and gameplay are simple while offering a lot of replayability. Unfortunately moving to a small town meant there was nobody nearby to play with and my wife had no interest in the game. Sold since the game went pretty much unplayed. Rather glad I did now because it sounds like the regular groups of players have turned to the Warhammer-like elitists that I'd rather not deal with.

I give this game an 7/10 grade for the squadron game and the rules that enhance the basic "Wings of War" mechanics.

I love Star Wars, and I love games.

Even with just the base game you can spend hours of fun...I knew I would expand and bought a tackle box to sort and organize my ships.

No other game I can think of has so such a high ratio of thematic depth to mechanic complexity, and no other table-top miniatures game can fit (core set, rules, multiples of each expansion) into a single small tackle box.  Some may decry the miniature price (about $15 for each fighter), but I would argue that those that complain, either don't care about the aesthetics of their game, or don't value their time (it would take me at least an hour to assemble, prime, paint, and seal a ship to the above-average quality at which these miniatures come out of the box).  I wouldn't say it is the best gaming experience in any one area (tactical depth, theme, aesthetics, etc.), but if all these categories were combined into a boardgame decathlon then X-Wing would be best overall game by finishing in the top-5 in several areas.

Love everything about this game, but sadly there is hardly anyone to play it with in my area.

Seriously though this game has so many great moments.

RATING: 8
Set aside nostalgia for a moment.  If this were a game about generic combat in space, would it be any good?  The surprising answer is yes.  The core mechanisms in the game are derived / lifted / borrowed from Wings of Glory.  Each ship has maneuvers that can be selected and a movement template that shows where the mini should end up.  The physical aspects of moving the ships is well thought out and works very well for the target audience (likely younger gamers).  And that's where you might think the game ends, but not so.  X-Wing combines a squad building and customization element into the game.  It is this customization and the rules framework (150 pt squads, 3' x 3' play area, etc) that really make this minis game shine.  When you add in the fact that you are playing with iconic star ships, you have a winner.  A solid and containable minis game that works well.  And that nostalgia... its not so bad either.

Absolutely lovely miniatures. I'm impressed.
I loathe the business model. I'm ambivalent, leaning toward dislike, about the gameplay. The basic idea of maneuvering your spaceships around is solid, and interesting. Measuring is way too fiddly, though, with lots of tiny bumps against the ships. What I like is how situations of correctly second-guessing your opponent's intended moves can lead to big advantages. What I hate is how large a role luck plays in the game, with dice rolls being far too swingy, and I had the feeling that turns swiftly start being pretty similar in feeling.

RATING: 7.5
X-Wing is an average game made good (maybe even very good) by it's outstanding production.  At its core it's a guessing game as players try to out maneuver their opponents on the table top.  Each side decides what all their ships will do simultaneously -- if you are clever/lucky and predict correctly you'll likely wind up in a better firing position than your opponent.

As in so many collectible games, a big part of the enjoyment will be customizing your squadrons.  Matching this ship with that pilot and those upgrades, trying to synergize special abilities and find killer combos is a big part of the game -- at least in "serious play"

The game plays simple and usually ends pretty quickly.  So much so that it's almost in the realm of a filler.

One downside is that its cost.  The base set isn't too bad but only enough miniatures to whet your appetite.  A proper introduction to the game probably requires at least another 2-4 ships (about 50 dollars more). If you DO decide to jump in and pick up lots minis, you'll also need to figure out a storage solution (something Im not quite sure I've accomplished yet). 

Also - with any game where dice have a major effect on the outcome, you can get some games that end abruptly, and others that overstay their welcome (as your fighters limply misfire at each other over and over again).

Ultimately the quality of the pre-painted miniatures and the very real sense of a swooping, spinning, star wars dog fighting make this game an enjoyable diversion if your willing to fork over the cash.

A bevezető játék után egy óvatos pontszámot adok a játéknak, de látom benne a fantáziát: a teljes játék akár sokkal jobb is lehet. Már a legegyszerűbb szinten (bevezető szabályok, 3 hajó) is jó kis taktikai játék, ahol azért szerencse is van rendesen: attól, hogy ügyesen manőverezek és sikerül ráfordulnom az ellenséges hajóra, úgy hogy az nem is tud visszalőni, még egyáltalán nem biztos, hogy el is találom. Szerintem ez a változat simán játszható 6-7 éves gyerekkel is.
Azt is el kell ismerni, hogy bár nem vagyok fanatikus, azért a SW figurák nélkül a játék osztva lenne kettővel (végül is a szerzők nem is nagyon csináltak mást tudtommal, mint egy korábbi játékot elővettek és megtöltötték egy kis SW tematikával). Elég veszélyes pénznyelőnek tűnik amúgy, minden újabb kis űrhajó egy vagyon.
---
Kipróbáltuk a haladót is, ez azért sokkal jobb, de még várok a felpontozással. Nem egy világrengető játék még így se, de megértem, ha a rajongókat beszippantja. Egy nagy terepasztalon 50 hajóval hihetetlen jó lehet, csak kár hogy az egy vagyon:)

This game is lots of fun. This is more the fact that it takes a lot of money to get the components. Same thing with Dominion, you can't play the base set on its own for more than a couple of plays.

Again, good game, if you want to spend all the money.

X-Wing has more than one resemblance to Wings of War / Wings of Glory, a game I played (without minis) but not loved.

I watched the original Star Wars movie on tv when I was six, then watched Return of the Jedi in a theatre the day after (yes, no Empire Strikes Back until later...), and my life changed. I probably watched every movie of the original trilogy 20+ times (and didn't care for anything else from the franchise, to be honest).
This to help understand that for me piloting an X-Wing is WAY COOLER than piloting a WWI fighter...

The game is fast and fun, the squadron building can be really interesting (I guess) and... you can make lots of mouth noises! What can you ask more from a game?

First Impressions: This is a very thematic tactical combat game, similar in many respects to Wings of War. Turn plotting is streamlined but combat is highly dice dependant, since the attacker must roll to hit and the defender can roll for defense. Ship choices, pilots and starting loadouts create endless variety. I really enjoy this game.

Excellent game, a lot of fun and excellent replay-ability. Reasonably high investment if you play in tournaments, meta-bloat due to design issues frequently invoke many in the community to declare that the game is "pay-to-win". Fantasy Flight is also blamed to some degree of not fully play testing expansions before their release, thereby creating such problems as a result. Despite these 'niggles', casual and Epic play is superb, mission play and the ability to create your own scenarios makes this game one of the most popular pre-painted miniatures titles.

A fun game that only lacks 1 thing at the moment: more ships.
With the 3 ships from the base game I just don't feel the epicness that Star Wars space battles could and should be.

[-]I think I will get more ships in the future and then the score will improve for sure.[/-] Heck, just playing with 2 base games (for a total of 6 ships) may generate a much more involving session.

Update:
In the end I traded the game away because I knew that if I started to invest into more ships that I'll open a can of worms which will cost me a fortune :)

This is a great system to play with miniatures. It seems almost everyone loves it.

I can't give it a perfect score though as it still is a collectable game which means its active life span to acquire extra miniatures is limited in time.

The majority of these games only last 3 years or so on a personal basis and after that you are stuck with lots of plastics/cards and an empty pocket. eg Dragon Dice - almost any LCG/CCG outside Magic - A&A miniatures...

This game seems to last longer and the Star Wars craze may put it into a higher orbit.

There is also an extreme good web based App for solo play and that is awesome because solo play extends every game's life cycle as you don't depend on finding other players for an older game.

So I would recommend a buy but I would also suggest: limit your purchases to 5 or 6 miniatures per side to keep control on your expenses.

Be warned. It is an extremely tense and competitive game and you WILL get caught by the "I need MORE XWing fever".

This is a great game set in the Star Wars Universe, which makes many ships recognisable to the fans. It combines (i) deck building like in a trading card game/ living card game, (ii) nice pre-painted models, (iii) simultaneous action selection and (iv) dice.
Since many interesting lists are only composed of two ships it´s also relatively cheap to start playing the game (you "need" some upgrades from different ship expansions though if you want to take it a little more serious). 
One of the most interesting aspects is the simultaneous action selection. You have to think what the other player will do while they do the same. So there is some room for surprises and a lot of skill involved in flying the ships effectively. 
Although this is a dice game and luck plays a role, the ability to outmaneuvre your opponent is more important. Some upgrade cards also let you modify your dice results.

I would recommend it to casual as well as more competitive players. The latter will probably get even more out of it (thriving meta game in store, regional and world championships).

Bought my first core set on December 22nd.  It is now December 27th, and I own the Falcon, both "Aces" packs, and pretty much one of every small Rebel and Imperial ship, less the scum set.

Where was this game when I was a kid?  Why did I take so long to jump in?

So much fun, even running solo missions with Flash-driven AI maneuvers.  

Can get expensive, but with a small ship costing just a bit more than a fast-food value meal, it really makes collecting easy and addictive.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this. I was leery of it with it being a miniatures game and was even more skeptical when I found out that it only came with 3 ships so the base game was 1 ship vs 2, but it played well and I think I would enjoy this a lot more with a decent sized fleet. I think there needs to be a lot more ship choice available though before I end up getting into this.

It's very simple, so easy to get into and good for multi-player, especially where the players have a mix of preferences for light vs heavy.  So in that sense, almost a social game.  I wonder about replayability, there isn't a lot of strategy so I doubt I'll be planning my next session much.

A really funny and dinamic game. simple mechanics, but if you look in deep there are more strategic move to use and make every game different. The luky part are obviously present, but using action and pilot ability you can limitate some of the luky part. Not a cheaper game, but the miniature are awesome and accurate.

Well, I told myself that I wouldn't get into another minis game because of the money pit, but I succumbed when I finally saw the game and ships in action. Coming from a minis background, I don't find the price point that expensive as expressed by others. The miniatures are painted and assembled; so that's a big plus for me. 

This is a mostly a tactical game where squad building and maneuvering plays a major part of succeeding on the board. Yes, there could be some randomness with the dice, but it could also be mitigated with the different abilities of the pilots and ships. Squad building can be fun, but I suggest one of the many squad builder's out there to make it simpler and quicker. This is the one I am using at the moment which has printable armies to boot:

http://xwing-builder.co.uk/build

What is great about the game is the way that the theme is captured with the gameplay and beautiful ships. Even though I am not a diehard fanboy of Star Wars, I found myself getting into the theme. I even watched the movies afterwards. Anyways, you will find yourself making pew pew sounds when you are involved in a battle and if you're not doing them out loud, then you are thinking about it.

Great stuff! Highly recommended; especially for dads and sons/daughters.

I like it a lot less than I did upon launch.  Mainly because it should be asymmetrical, but it's not. Too many TIE swarms?  No worries, the rebels now have a disposable swarm fighter.  TIEs getting blown up too easy?  No worries, you can just get this TIE we made up with shields and cloaking.  This all speaks to the point that pretty much the whole game is now EXPANDED FUCKING UNIVERSE which I refuse to acknowledge.  Not coincidentally, the producers of episode VII seem to be on my side.

1/13: I was very unsure about this game because I don't really enjoy Wings of War.

I was eager to play X-Wing, as I read so many praises about it: luckily, a friend of mine was even more eager than I and recently bought this game with as many expansions as he could lay his hands on. We immediately started playing it, so I discovered all those praises weren’t undeserved: X-Wing is decidedly a fine game.

Undoubtedly it reminds Wings of War but this similitude is only superficial: actually, by getting rid of the dedicated card decks and streamlining most manoeuvers, X-Wing improves Wing of War’s gameplay and makes it both easier and deeper, making for many more tactical options and unpredictability than the latter.

I can’t help but think the Rebels have slight advantages over the imperial fleet: they're not game-changing but relevant enough to force the Empire player to avoid any mistake. [i](August 2013)[/i]

[b]Update[/b] - I’m so fed up with this Star Wars frenzy which seems to have infected everyone lately that now I can barely stand anything linked to this annoying saga: moreover, playing X-Wing has become so bulky and time-consuming that I’m glad to avoid it for the time being.

Hence, I lowered my rating from 9 to 7 in December 2015.

So much better than I ever found Wings of War to be, and not just because of the setting.

The box it self is pretty neat, but without the extra ships it gets pretty old pretty quick.  Once you add a few ships, it gets awesome.

It gets a lot better the more ships you buy as the possible upgrades start to pour in!  Plus the big ships have a lot of nifty rules and abilities which keeps it pretty fresh.

Always enjoyable to play. It's easier to get to the table than Armada due to length and shorter set-up time, but turns feel like alternating between firing and K-turning and winning comes down to having a string of good dice rolls. Also the fact that I can't keep up financially with the new ships means this one won't see too much action sadly.

I've been agonizing all day trying to put my finger on what it is about X-Wing Miniatures that stops me from considering it one of my favourite games, because on paper its got it all.

Tiny, beautiful minis set in the Star Wars universe, battling it out for galactic supremacy... what's not to love?

There's amazing theme, wonderful aesthetics, heavy tactics and a smattering of luck, all in seemingly near-perfect balance, so why don't I LOVE this game?

And I'm sorry to disappoint, but I'm still not sure.

All I can say is that I've never walked away from a game thinking "well, that was excellent"... even if I've won. 

I think perhaps that every game I've played has gotten very predictable, very quickly, with not a great deal of movement and action variation (certainly in the core set). 

Sure, tactics are hugely important, but it seems to me to be a lot of micro management and I don't think there's enough scope for some 'big moves' that have the potential to upset the balance of power.

Maybe I'm wrong - perhaps its just fundamentally not my kind of game, but I reeeeally want it to be.

The agonizing continues......

Only played this game solo so far and am enjoying the theme very much.  Its definitely a light game.  Not much in the way of realism, in that I mean if you are following another ship, you should be able to follow it and make your heading changes according to what he does.  Instead you have to both secretly choose a maneuver and hope you guessed right, if not then for some odd reason he turned left and you turn right then so be it.  If you can deal with situations like that and like Star Wars I think you will like this game.  It is really fun, the ships look amazing and it plays pretty fast.  The rules are very light as well.  Another negative is the way this game is marketed.  If you get hooked your wallet will take a pounding by buying new ships at about $15 each, it adds up pretty quickly.  FFG definitely knows what they are doing.

It would be a 9 (it is, see below for explanation) but the stands break too easily and replacements are not readily available. If FF would put them up for sale I'd buy a supply of them and this score would be a 9. They were kind enough to send me a few free replacements but I'd be happier with a paid pack of rather more than that.

I really do like this game and would be very happy to play it more but set up, tear down and find the correct nerdy opponent is not so easy.

I would buy more of the minis if they were were in stock since they are beautiful little works of art. I've no interest in the ships larger than the MF or Slave 1. For me this is a dogfight game.

Scum and villainy are desperately needed in Europe!

Fortunately scum and villainy ships finally turned up and FF were kind enough to send me even more stands free of charge. I'd prefer to buy a big bag of them but this sends the score up to 9 again. This is a really great game supported by a great game company.

These days they even sell the bases! (Phew, they cost a bit though). Anyway I just got another few ships just to be nice. Two new basic sets, another Tie interceptor, another A-wing and another K-wing, the idea being we can use them as either Rebels, Scum and V or Imperials in disguise or any variations of proxying.

This game continues to play well and be very enjoyable.

Takes forever to set up, but this game is gorgeous in its design and simple in its execution.

While I'm getting a little sick of the metagame and the not-from-the-movies sets, that's MY issue, not the game's.

I always want to play another game once my game is over.

This bears obvious similarities to Wings of War, but brings a number of new elements into play, including the upgrade cards, pilot special abilities, etc. And let's not forget, it's Star Wars! I grew up playing X-Wing and TIE Fighter on the PC so this was a no-brainer for me in spite of the cost. I can see myself wanting to move away from straight dogfights and onto scenarios quite quickly though, so I hope they pick up the pace in terms of scenario design. I'm sure the BGG community will also start churning out decent scenarios to try. Enjoying this one right now, and my 7 year old is loving it.

RATING: 7
The pluses are obviously it's Star Wars and beautifully done right out of the box. Pretty easy rules that get a little complicated with multiple upgrades for each ship. The minus is plodding game play and fiddliness. Like all real-life-based fighter combat games, which I love, with several ships a side to make a decent battle, each turn takes several minutes so it's hard to keep the connection between lightning fast movie combat that we see on the screen and the glacial pace of this game. Add in the inevitable furball with ships' placement and movement, and template alignment- what a mess. Have to try the Hex version of this! All the gripes aside, the pluses outweigh the minuses if the fights are kept to a reasonable size, and upgrades are limited to a few per ship.

It's probably not my cup of tea, and it probably wasn't the best play of the game ever.

When I get my starfighters on the table, it brings back so many memories! But this game is more than just a money grab at nostalgia. The pilots and upgrades all represent the Star Wars universe so well. And I love the way you can move with the dials without needing to stay on a grid. It's probably the best table-top Star Wars game in existence. By that I mean it executes the theme with innovative mechanics and an easy-to-learn rules set. My rating of 8 is a personal preference because starfighter combat just isn't the part of Star Wars that lights me up and the rating comes from my desire to play as per suggest BGG ratings. But when I'm in the mood for starfighter combat, no game will beat this one. Ever.

Biggest complaint about this game is the poor packaging of the game. I don't play it often enough to research storing options of all the ships. I've got a handful of ships that fit in the box but the singles they sell...just sitting on the shelf. Everything from movement to combat feels awkward. It isn't that fun when you play with my current situation in which there are only 3 mini's for each player.

That being said, I would love to play this game with a massive fleet. It feels like this game thrives on chaos for it to be fun. I bet the fun factor goes through the roof if you have a massive fleet. Without ever having that options, its just a speculation however.

Core box is a little light on content, and it's dated anyhow for anything competitive but it's not just a miniatures combat game, it's components for a bunch of other options.  HotAC co-op campaign, Mario Kart, FFG missions (which aren't wonderfully balanced but w/e) multiple tourney formats, furball.  Well worth owning a few ships and a core even if you just wanna play around with em like toys (which they are).

The game has fun mechanics, but nowadays it's more about the right "build" than it is about outmaneuvering your opponent. The game is kinda like Android: Netrunner in that there's such a big tournament scene that it's hard to find anyone willing to play a casual game using a "fun" list. Therefore I think I'm done with this game.

Solid mechanisms, gorgeous to look at, star wars, what could go wrong?

Traded away my base set.

There's a lot of potential here and I can see epic battles or scenarios coming in the future. Basic set is good for reading the rules and learning the game and offers some fun moments but you really should have att least second basic set to really enjoy the game.

To me, this mixes two amazing things - [x]building games and minis. In this case you build squads, not typical decks, but it's just as fun. And it's Star Wars. And the minis come pre-painted. And that's awesome. The only knock I have on this game is that the space required and the setup time can make you turn to other shorter setup games, but once it's on the table, it's an awesome game experience. Love it.

I currently have every expansion and plan on continuing with playing this awesome game.

The ship miniatures are really pretty, but I don't find it that much fun to play. The times where someone actually manages to outmaneuver the other ships are too rare, and besides that there isn't much opportunity for clever play. It's fun for a few turns but then the turns gets same-y, especially if the players roll better on their defense than on their offense. It's better with scenarios that add something beyond "take out all enemy ships".

Maneuver and card-combos make this game what it is. And it is not a cheap game overall. I`ve dropped at least $400 on it so far and I still don`t have every piece. Piloting your ships is essential, and there are so many options to choose from: Swarm of small ships? Tank with support? Two tank team? Fast and maneuverable vs. slow and durable? Glass cannon vs. manipulation? So many options and counter options to choose from that this game leaves you satisfied and wanting more.

Since the game got worn out it hit the table less and less. So I decided to sell the whole fleet.

Great skirmish game. I love it. I own 2.
The planning mechanic where you set your maneuvers in the dial and you have to plan ahead with "I think you are going there so I should going here and you might be expecting that so I do something different."
Plus you have a squad-building aspect with a strong interaction between the ships, the pilots and the equipment. I really love it.
Quickly explained and it's a cheap variant of a tabletop game (as long as you play it casually with just the base set and maye a handfull of expansions).

...well well well...
After time passed by I reconsidered my rating. It still is a great skirmish-style game that can totally be recommended but for me it has lost it's shine. I still like it but it is not a game that I still wish to play as often as possible. Maybe it's time to let it rest a bit...

I was interested to give this one a try since it is rated so highly.   It is your standard miniature game, where you execute orders to try to get your minis within range of your opponent and blow them away.   

It was pleasantly simple, and the templates used for movement and range were straightforward.

Still, this isn't the sort of game that generally interests me.   I can see why some people love it though.

X-Wing Miniatures is one of the kinds of games that looks good when not in use and is great when it is. I don't have many opportunities to play it, and it is a huge money sink, but I had to play it to make sure I liked it before ordering more ships. Needless to say, I ordered more ships. Great game, even for someone not steeped in miniature gaming.

Massive improvement over the core mechanics from Wings of War. The addition of a movement DIAL (instead of cards) alone is an outstanding change. Plus the ship customization and Action system add much better strategic and tactical depth.

The game still suffers from a few old Wings of War problems though. Moving through other units still requires estimation of the final location. Also, the ships can wiggle a bit while attempting to move them. A felt play surface could help reduce this. I also don't like the official "rule disagreements" resolution system of rolling dice.

A smashing miniatures game; Star Wars in a box. The minis are amazingly detailed and well painted and the gameplay is fast-paced and fun. The vast number of modification cards that can be added to ships makes for a ton of replayability, as does the vast number of ships themselves. One problem with this game, however, is that there is some power creep in the higher waves of ships; but this isn't really a problem for the casual player.

BGG says I'm up to 11 plays; pretty sure it's substantially more than that.

This is a game I play and always enjoy, but I'm going to again express my mixed feelings about the whole thing, especially the most recent sets. Even though, again, I do enjoy it.

As they dig deeper into the EU, X-Wing does feel like it's selling cool toys, and not really a game. With the constant pinging around of the metagame with each new wave, and scenarios that are a really mixed bag, the play experience gets a bit uneven. I've actually found the epic ships - the CR90 and particularly the most recent Imperial Corvette - to be the most frustrating, with very sketchy scenarios and campaign systems and somewhat questionable playability on the ships themselves. They look absolutely great on the table. I just don't know if they play that well, except for the Rebel Transport which works fine just as a moving target for scenario objectives.

Anyway, the game is Star Wars, and it's good enough. But like everything from FFG, it's not hard to wish the i's had been fully dotted, and the t's crossed. Both Wings and Sails of Glory are much better games, but they aren't Star Wars :)

---

Been playing this a bit more recently, which has been fun. It's cool just to get the nice minis out on a nice playmat and mix it up. For infrequent play, though, one thing I find a bit frustrating is just how lucky the game is. Recently I was playing the Preystalker scenario, where the Imperials try to jump a single target ship. The scenario starts with the target at a severe positional disadvantage, with the Imperials able to unload one full round of fire without the Rebels able to do much about it. I decided I needed to dispose of at least one of the escorts first, before they could really return fire, before tackling the main target (the Millennium Falcon). The hail of blaster fire from the initial salvo did exactly nothing, and that essentially decided the game. The Rebels turned around, I was outgunned, and that was that. Because of the really swingy nature of the combat system, if the dice are fickle games can turn pretty quickly on the first kill unless your squad is really robust. Anyway, I still enjoy the game, but especially now - with so many ships and so many combos available, with such a complex meta-game and with so many unbalanced cards - it's a hard game to play if you're not seriously into it enough to be able to quickly prune the game space.
---
Mixed feelings. Lacks the grace and elegance of Wings of War, and there isn't as much interesting nuance to the tactics of X-Wing as there is to either WWI or WWII Wings of War, and X-Wing's damage system is very swingy. On the other hand, X-Wing does have cool squadron-building and pilot abilities, and it plays fast. On balance, fun, but I seriously doubt it has the staying power of its sister game.

I've never played a miniatures game before, but the combination my love of Star Wars and the focus on accessibility convinced me to give this a try, much like many other people I'm sure.

I'm sure this isn't unique to THIS game in particular, but there's something that feels cool and freeing about moving around a huge play space rather than a grid on a board. Everything about this game evokes the feel of a real space battle.

The minis themselves are lovely. I justified my purchase of the game just by telling myself that even if I hate the game, at least I'll have cool Star Wars toys.

I've only played with the base set so far and, fair warning, it's really, really not enough. It feels like playing the introduction to a system and not at all a full game. If you're looking for a game that is fun and replayable out of the box you're pretty out of luck here.

So let's see here: plus-points for: accessibility, pacing, length, bitchin' minis, variety of ships (in that they all feel different), and options for building your fleet. So what's on the negative side?

Disclaimer: Some of this is due to the makeup of the starter ships.

...but the luck factor is just too high. The system in place to mitigate the luck is the Action mechanic. The idea is, if you choose your actions smartly (based on what you think your opponent will do) you will be able to increase your odds of attacking or evading.

However, with the starter fleet any increase you can get your opponent can easily match, thus making it come down to just... pure luck. It's too easy for BOTH sides to easily roll the same number of dice (or close to it) and have the same perks (rerolling dice or changing their values.) Perhaps it was a mistake to allow Focus to have the same effect for defense as it does for offense.

There are moments where this game feels like a fun mind game of bluff and double-bluff, but because combat is so lackluster that's really ALL there is to the game (and really, there are better psychological games around). I'm sure this game is more fun with a greater variety of ships as the metagame of building your fleet becomes ever more important, but as it is the game feels just too shallow for me to want to really invest in.

So... mindless and expensive? Under what circumstances would I ever recommend this? Well, I believe games have an emotional component. And this evokes the Star Wars theme like basically nothing else... so if you want to spend half an hour indulging in the fantasy of piloting an X-Wing then this will do you.

Similar to Wings of War but with a less appealing theme (for me). Nice models and movement selectors instead of the manoeuvre decks and I like the ability to choose different pilots for the same ship model. The game though isn't very deep. It's all about outguessing your opponent and getting ships into a position where they can fire. This base set of one ship versus two seems like an underhand marketing ploy to make gamers buy at least one more set as three ships isn't much of a battle.

I avoided this one for the longest time. I saw the steep, long, slippery slope. Then two event conspired to pull me down: 1) A "friend" brought his collection over and set it up for a play, and 2) MiniatureMarket has a massive sale. As expected, I really enjoyed it and am now up to my neck in it.

I like that it's a fast-moving, fluid system that allows you to quickly get to the tactical choices in the dogfight. The miniatures make for great eye candy while playing--that's great while it's on the table, and awful when plunking down more money for more ships.

RATING: 10
The game is massively expensive (at least $140 MSRP to have a decent 100v100 fight), it relies a bit too much on luck (dice based combat), and is very fiddly (measuring templates, hundreds of chits, tons of upgrade cards modifying rules with rerolls, etc.)

That said, this is Star Wars dogfighting at its finest.  There is nothing more satisfying than completing the perfect maneuver that skirts the edge of an asteroid and brings your opponent straight into your crosshairs for the kill shot.

On top of that, the models from FFG are absolutely top notch.  The paint jobs, the attention to detail, and the iconic designs make the models themselves worth the cost of admission.  The fact that FFG provides rules for a fun, exciting game for which to use these models is almost gravy.

Ok went to GENCON and had a blast this year. So last year I tried out the playtest version of this and was not impressed at the least. So I was not inclined to try it this year figuring that FF didnt listen to the suggestions. We ll went by and my buddy decided to get a box set and a few blisters. I decided to give it a second chance and I have to say that they have a winner in this game. The pieces are slick and well made. The ships are sweet and the rules are very well put together. We played a couple more demos and by the end of the day the two of us were in for 6 box sets and about a dozen blisters of the X-wing, TIE fighter, TIE advanced and Y wing. We went back to the hotel and popped open the game with a couple of other gamers we met and went about doing a 150 pt game with each getting 75 pts. we were quickly in to a good fight and the dice gods were on my side by the end of it. I decided to go with 2 xwings and lots of add ons and the rest went with a couple of big guys and a lot of little guys. it plays smooth, has enough diversity between the two factions and the sides balance well. I recommend this game very highly and you should give it a shot. BTW on Saturday after 3pm they slipped models of the Millennium Falcon, Slave 1, A Wing and the TIE interceptor into the display case with a release date of winter 2012. The blisters come with extra counters and more pilot and upgrade cards so you should get them as well. 
Later and hope this helps,

This game captures some of the excitement I felt when I first saw X-Wings and Tie Fighters battle in the original movies over two decades ago.  But even if I wasn't a Star Wars fan, I would still have to appreciate the detailed models, strategy, and refreshing game mechanics that make this game shine.  The different ships and cards give great variation to squadron building and especially clever is that both players must secretly select ship movement (done by using a dial that is placed face down).  All of this creates a brilliant sense of anticipation and enjoyment as you wait to see if you correctly predicted your opponent’s next move in order to line them up in your firing arc.

I bought Wings of War...and eventually traded it away. The game just didn't do it for me. 

Later on, I was the manager of a game store and even helped organize Wings of War events because the owner of the store was into the game. Every time I participated, I genuinely hoped for a good experience - and every time felt I was just going through the motions to be a good sport. There's just not enough pay off in this type of system for me.

People claim X-Wing is much better. I see why they say that due to the mechanical changes. However, X-Wing still leaves me with the same inescapably unsatisfying feeling that Wings of War did - and does so every single time I've played it without exception.

This just isn't my type of game. Plus, the miniatures are VERY expensive.

RATING: 7
My first and only miniatures game.  I love the theme, the mechanics, and mostly the customization of forces.  Very reminiscent of the old TIE fighter video game, which was one of my all time favorite video games.

For me, the meat of the game is how to trick out your forces using the upgrade cards.  I would be bored silly playing with the 8 tie academy swarm, since they can't take their upgrades.  I also tend to enjoy the decision tree regarding movement.  There is a bit of the she thinks I will go here, but I will go here, but maybe that is what she is expecting because she thinks I won't go there doublethink that keeps movement selection interesting.

I am partial to smaller battles.  The wife tends to pick a build she likes, and that is my point target for the game.  It seems like you can balance the core set and wave 1 to favor a particular side based on points allowed.

I am certainly not into this for the tournament scene.  Since I love the customization so much, I think playing the same squad for multiple games (which I am pretty sure I have not yet done) would bore me. I like to sit back, pop in a CD of the soundtracks and take my new squad out for a spin each time we play.

Overall this game shines by having simple dog fighting rules anyone can jump into quickly, awesome miniatures, and an overall fun game.

The maneuver templates do have a tenancy to overlap other ships during the game and perfect placement isn't always going to happen. The game does not reproduce any type of three dimensions. Not enough official scenarios.

I rate it high because of the level of fun I have had playing it and the very high quality of the figures. I am also probably drawn in by the kick ass theme too.

Na veel onderzoek online te hebben verricht naar een toegankelijke wargame kwam star wars x-wing bovenaan uit de lijst rollen. Volledig nieuw in dit genre storten ik en een paar vrienden, die zelfs amper bordspellen spelen zich op deze game. Iedere aanwezige is lierisch over het spel. De miniaturen zijn van groot detail voor mij als leek is de paint job super.( vermoedelijk discutabel voor de pro printers ;-) ). De meegeleverde schepen ogen fragiel dus neem voorzichtigheid in acht! De meegeleverde tokens en kaarten zijn van goede kwaliteit, voor de kaarten heb ik zelf plastic hoesjes aangeschaft. Als je allereerst de 3 meegeleverde missies speelt wordt geleidelijk de game uitgelegd, langzaam besef je dat het spel doormiddel van upgrades aardig te diepte in kan duiken. De spelregels zijn goed te begrijpen mits je engels kan lezen. Binnen 10 min heb je het spel aan een medespeler uitgelegd en spelenderwijs na 1 avond onder de knie. Bij mij werd na avond 1 direct geopperd een vaste gameavond in te plannen. Met de basis set ben je waarschijnlijk een paar keer zoet en omdat je zelf missies kan samenstellen blijft het leuk maar ik merk dat hoe meer units je op tafel brengt de epische veldslagen nog beter tot zijn recht komen. 1 min puntje Is dat de basis zet maar 3 dobbelstenen van elk bezit, dit terwijl je een enkele keer een 4de nodig hebt. Ik heb 2x de basissen aangeschaft. Dit is verre weg het efficiënts. ( indien je toch wil upgraden ) Voor mijn persoonlijk een dikke 10. ( leeftijd aanwezige 25 - 30 )

X-wing does an excellent job of adapting and updating the Wings of War mechanics. In particular I like the addition of dice rolls, as well as the convenience of the manouver dials. The models are excellent quality, and I can see this will become a favourite in our gaming group.

RATING: 9.4
A great game, great theme, and great system! It is a blast to play, and a game where I think about the meta when I'm not playing.  Simply flying the ships around is so much fun.  Love the moments where your plans work out perfect and you are millimeters safe from another ship or obstacle! Love the heartbreaking moments where you thought you missed the ship or asteroid and you clip it, lose an action, and/or take damage! Love playing this even if I lose! Such a beautiful game to even watch being played! Not many games you can say that about! The dice chucking and set-up/take down time is the only thing for me that keeps it from a perfect score.

RATING: 9.6
X-Wing is a very standard miniature games, you set a movement, move accordingly with the innitiative/skill of every unit, and then everybody shoots, also in skill order. The skills of pilots and the add ons to the ships are really good, and they add a lot of strategy when you setup your squadron, and of course, miniatures are gorgeous!

Super fun game.  My kids had a blast with this one.  The only drawback with this game is that it is somewhat of a money pit.  You really need more than the base game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Well thought out mechanics, especially the simultaneous turns. Players are faced with tough and meaningful tactical and strategic decision making during game-play, as well as during the squad and equipment selection process. Strikes a good balance between customization and streamlined list building. Overall game balance is fairly good - most equipment and ship options are useful, and it's entirely possible to build semi-competitive squadrons that adhere to the fluff.

The main negative point is the relatively high amount of random chance. The maneuvering aspect is totally player-determined, but combat is dice based (and quite deadly and unforgiving). There are many dice-manipulation mechanics that players can exploitt, but relatively few dice are rolled over the course of the game, which results in a lot of variance in combat results. Despite this, the game rewards skillful play enough that skilled players can consistently defeat weaker players.

Update Dec 2016, 270 plays: Bumped the score up to 10. Continues to be one of the most interesting competitive two-player game I've played. The current competitive metagame is very rich, but relies overmuch on ability combos instead of maneuvering.

Rating for the entire game [family=18113]family[/family]. This deviates from my usual policy to rate base games and expansions separately, but I think the X-Wing base games just can't sensibly be rated without their expansions. They obviously weren't designed to be played with just a base game.
My rating contains a sizeable bonus for the existence of a large official, well-organized tournament scene, the fact that the official FAQ is updated regularly and that FFG is not afraid to change cards that turn out to be too weak or particularly too strong.
I would like the game considerably better if movement and check for viable targets were based on hexes (or squares) instead of the fiddly and imprecise maneuver templates and a line laser.
Moreover, expansions are published too frequently for my taste: The meta changes too quickly and it is too expensive to stay competitive.

A wonderful space dogfight in Star Wars universe. If that theme doesn't already attract you, the gameplay also quite good.

Ehh not a bad game, but takes too long to play for what you get out of it. Bad buy for me. If you're really into the modelling equivalent of deck building (spending your time optimising your squad) I could see the attraction but frankly Wings of War provides just as much game otherwise. Pass.

Awesome game, but the overall environment has gotten a little too competitive for my tastes.

This is a great and simple to learn dog-fighting game. The ships look beautiful and would be collectable on their own without the game. Easy to learn, but difficult to master, the different card mechanics to choose from make this game extremely replayable. With beautifully painted ships coming out in new waves all the time and the scope of the Star Wars universe, this game will be around for many years to come. In short, get it - you won't regret it.

Miniatures games have never been my cup of tea, and this game reminds me why:  (1) fiddly measurement/movement; and (2) a protracted set-up phase where you try to build your army within the point limit.  

All this planning and attention to detail becomes downright silly with paired with the game's central mechanic:  chucking dice.  Plus movement is rather chaotic, and it's often a matter of pure guesswork whether your move is the right one.

The miniatures are well made, but honestly, who (other than 11-year olds) cares?  If that's important to you (and you have $100 to spend), then you'll love this puerile dice-fest.

Very accessible and fun game that can be played as an out-of-the-box boardgame or a more involved competitive miniatures game.

RATING: 8.25
Nice variation of Wings of War.  I like the idea of adding attack and defense dice, but in my first play the dice didn't seem to work as well as I had hoped.  There was a lot of work for no hits, but since the ships all have low health maybe this is the intention.  I liked the movement wheels, and the notches in the base for the movement templates to fit into.  That solved a big problem with movement cards moving while moving ships.  Solid game & I would like to get some more plays in before passing judgement.

Update...After you add unique ship and pilot powers the game is great.  That solved all the parts I was squishy about.

I love everything about this game. 

It's incredibly easy to get into, there are a handful of rules in the base game and the movement templates take all of the usual hassle associated with movement in miniatures games out of this. Add to this a very high quality tutorial video from FFG (which is amazing, more of this please board game makers in general!) and rather than the usual one or two games to get into the rules it only took one or two rounds.

The game itself plays fast and is good fun. The miniatures all look fantastic, a little pricey but given the quality, and the fact that it saves me having to hand paint everything, it seems like a price that's worth paying (especially when compared to how much you need to spend on the average miniatures game to field a force).

Given it a 9 rather than a 10 because I'm not too sure about longevity. The next few waves of ships look great and are must-haves, beyond that they will be getting into obscure ships that don't have the same appeal, at which point you will be largely fighting the same dogfights over and over. The best way around this would be more scenarios and a full campaign ruleset, if they make that wave 4 then this has the legs to run for a long time.

RATING: 10
(two base sets, multiples of each expansion)

My initial ranking of this game is more a reflection of how often I would want to get it to the table than a declaration of its true objective value if measured in some kind of vacuum (like outer space! har har). Huh...not sure that made sense.

I love the game, so much so that I've bought enough of the expansions to stay competitive even though I know I'm not going to play it at, say, GenCon. 

But it's involved to set it up and put away (and I'm a hypocrite about that because I don't mind the effort with Heroscape). It's also a lot of brainpower if you're flying enough ships, but not in a complex way as much as a taxing/exhausting way. 

I avoided it at first because it wasn't Wings of War. And I was wrong for doing so. No, it's not WoW/WoG, instead it's yet another form of skirmish combat with miniatures. But we're talking the king of themes here and it works; if you don't feel like you're in the middle of an epic Star Wars space battle, that's your fault, not the game's.

Update: Increasing rating to a 9. In many ways, X-Wing is a combination of Wings of War and Heroscape, two of my favorite games of all time.

Okay, fine...my original 7 rating was too low, obviously (not sure what I was thinking). It sets a bit of a challenging hurdle to initially overcome (for the reasons stated above, and flying well is still not easy). But it's such a great game! Each Wave release has been well thought out without any obvious "feature creep", at least through Wave 3. And anything that produces a gigantic Transport and Corvette should be rewarded!

So I still don't get to play this anywhere near enough, but I managed to win a local store tournament and had a blast doing so, even if afterwards I felt like I had a migraine.

And now I'm upgrading it to a 10. It's everything I love in a game: Dice, board positioning (flying), sometimes simultaneous selection (allows for outguessing), and most importantly, the game outside the game, where you can always make tweaks here and there. Heroscape will always be my first love, but this is a close second.

Mesmo que você não curta jogos de combate, só a beleza das miniaturas já valeria a compra deste jogo. Porém a FFG conseguiu unir o útil ao agradável e criou um jogo simplesmente maravilhoso (visualmente falando) com uma mecânica simplesmente sensacional, exigindo o emprego de tática e estratégia e permitindo duelos espetaculares. 
O único problema é ter que comprar algumas naves separadamente. No mais, X-WING é um jogo fantástico e que cativa os mais velhos (pela franquia Star Wars) e os mais novos pelos ótimos combates que proporciona.

RATING: 5
Awesome FFG minis, good art and component quality. Rules seem quick and easy for a miniatures skirmish game due to the prebuilt rulers for the different maneuvers each ship can execute.

Can be modded as a multiplayer casual game.

I'm not that into the ship miniature combat system though.

My favourite game, my pride, my addiction! It's my first miniature wargame and I love every aspect of it. I can't get enough of it. I love the depth of squad building, lately I've tried a couple of missions and they are fun as well. It's super easy to learn, very hard to master. When you execute that tight maneuver and lend in perfect spot to attack the enemy's ship while you dodge his arc of fire? It's priceless! I'm never too tired to play this game.

Played the intro rules a couple of times with my 7-year-old. This is basically Wings of War, but plotting one move at a time instead of three and using a little maneuver-select dial per ship with shared cardboard movement templates instead of individual maneuver decks. This speeds up play a little bit, leaving room for chrome. The pilot cards, upgrades, and action system are ingeniously simple while adding all kinds of flavor.

Not rating officially until I play the full game with adults, but my kid and I had a blast playing the intro game (and he wants to try the full rules next). Unless my initial impressions are sorely mistaken, I expect to award this game a 9 at least.

RATING: 6
I guess it's ok. I get the appeal - you get a quick playing game with just enough tactics and customizations to keep it interesting.

But for me personally, it's just too beer & pretzels to be anything but filler. A bit too much luck, and it's not like the maneuvering is all that profound (although perhaps more than I'd like to admit). It's also easy to game the VP system, and come up with uber-combos that can be used to abuse the individual scenarios. I generally like meatier games at this point. The miniatures are pretty cool, though, and it definitely works well for large groups.

I'm thinking of using the miniatures with [i]Star Warriors[/i] to get the deeper tactical flavoring that I want.

I thought this would be a game my kids and I would really love. It just isn't that great of a game unless you enjoy fiddly tactical mini games.

Simultaneous move selection is kinda fun trying to outguess your opponent, but quickly loses its novelty.

The ship stems break very easily taking them on and off. Best to leave them on if you have a place to store/display them.

This game (especially the core box) felt incomplete to me. The mechanisms seemed good, the theme is beloved, and yet the game just didn't strike that chord.

I feel that this may in part be due to the components included in the core box. The base game comes with 2 Tie Fighters and 1 X-wing (along with all the tokens/cards/rulers needed to play). This was serviceable enough, but the dogfights felt shallow. We purchased a second core box to add some more ships to each players arsenal... and still the game felt unfulfilling. Then we purchased some different ship expansions like the Millennium Falcon and the Slave 1 to add some variety... and still the game felt unfulfilling. At this point, it was hard not to draw comparisons to games like MTG or Warhammer where it would take an endless stream of money and expansions to make the game feel whole.

Maybe the game would feel better if the gameplay wasn't focused around the point-based skirmishes (ALA Warhammer 40k) and had more of a story or campaign like its ground based cousin Imperial Assault. Ultimately, the game just felt more like a constant treadmill of buying expansions to shape that perfect fleet rather than a good game in and of itself.

A pity, I really wanted to like it too.

I am normally not a fan of miniatures-type games.  However, I find myself in the odd position of really liking this one.  The mechanics were very simple, almost intuitive.  For lack of a better term, they made "sense."  It was also surprisingly fun.  The best way I can describe it is Blue Max on, if not steroids, then at least meth.  The minis had loads of detail, and looked fantastic.  The base of the stands could be heavier, but otherwise, they were great.  I won't buy this, simply because I can't afford it, but I will play it anytime.

OK, my rating went from an 8 to a 7.  This has become the miniatures version of Magic.  Gotta get the new set, gotta have the latest ship, gotta make use new rules and new abilities, gotta play in a tournament, yada, yada, yada....  Yuck!  it was so much better with just X-wings, Y-Wings, and TIE fighters.  The base game is fun, but it's just too much now.

While perhaps not a blatant rip-off of Wings of War, it's similar enough that FFG at least could have mentioned it in the credits. 

The game is fun and fast enough not to outstay it welcome. Not as newbie friendly as WoW as you really need to build a squad beforehand. The up-side is that the games feels deeper with all the ways you can modify your ships (pilots, weapons, droids, etc.).

RATING: 7
Great ships and a fun rule set.  I want to love this game, but two main things get in the way.

1- It seems that I always get screwed by the dice rolls.  Bad luck generally, but I haven't played a game yet where a good maneuver actually paid off.  I either rolled like crap and died, or they rolled like a champ and killed me.  Not the game's fault, but it tempers my enthusiasm a bit.

2- Due in part to the above, the building of ships often leads to no great results, as they blow up without getting to use their bits and skills.  I try to avoid just swarm tactics, but the game seems to lean towards them more and more.

Ultimately, it's a good game that I just haven't had that one great experience with yet. Once I do, I am sure it will go up.  And damn, it always looks good on the table.

I'm always shocked when FFG puts together a playable game, but I'll admit that the bar is getting raised. 

X-Wing is pretty much a carbon-copy of the great Wings of War card game. But they sped up the game with longer distance moves and only one phase of programming. 

The changes are great thematic ones: lock-ons, proton torpedoes, a simple shield mechanic, and a robust pilot-skill for initiative. He might be standing on eth shoulders of giants, but I give a lot of credit to the great development work by Jason Little, kudos!

This looks very cool, but I am leary of the costs to really get into it.  
Looks like if I bought 1 Y-wing and 1 Advanced TIE pack, the sides would still be equal.  That still won't get me up to  100 point squad though!  It would be really nice to have 2 of each ship type, with 2x that for standard TIE Fighters. 

Ideal package: 2 Starter packs, 1 X-Wing, 2 Y-Wings, 1 TIE fighter, 2 TIE Advanced (=$110 CSI!)

If this were an $80 box with all the ships I'd ever need, I'd be more into it.  Paying $10-15 per expansion ship is hard to swallow!  At least the way it is, I can just buy the Starter pack and make sure I like it.

UPDATE: Ah, I know I'll love it.  Big squad pre-ordered.  Money can't buy me love, but it can buy Star Wars toys.

One of my new favorite games to come out in the last few years.  It reminds me of HeroScape. The game play isn't similar, but you get to pick out cool miniatures, and they have special abilities (different pilots and Upgrade cards). You build a squad based on point values, there are easy movement rules, and the combat with rolls for attack and defense is easy but fun.

The other thing about HeroScape it reminds me of is after you set up a game, you want to play a few more times because the setup and take-down is longer than an individual game. 

My son loves the game, and would probably love to play every day if he could.

It is a fun game to play 1 vs. 1, but is also a good convention game. I think playing a massive battle on huge tables at a convention would be a great experience.

At this point I think I'm ready to claim that XWing is the best of the Flight Path Games and better than Wings of Glory (but for different reasons). The game is tight, well designed, atmospheric and tense. Everything from production to editing and quality control is top shelf. It is just a great and competitive game. I've come to love the clear and separate factions that are balanced (Looking at you Star Trek) and love that the same level of component quality has remained constant (glace back at Star Trek). Also, the scaling of three different ship sizes is an amazing accomplishment and how it all works. My only gripe is that scenario play is really non-existent. Sure there's some here or there, but the default mode of a handful of asteroids and 100 pts became the default because it creates a tense game, but a samey game.

This may have been an obsession of mine if it wasn't for Android Netrunner taking up too much real estate in my brain. 
   The game is fun from the very first time you move a ship along a template, inducing the inevitable "neeeyowww" sound that all kids make when playing with toys. Movement and combat is fundamentally simple, made insanely deeper by the vast array of ship cards, pilot cards and upgrade cards in the game. FFG have done the Star Wars IP justice and created a beast of a competitive game. 
    However, matches do tend to end with little drama, with both players drawing the game to a usually inevitable conclusion as the single remaining ship is chased down over one too many turns. 
    Nethertheless, I'm usually up for a game and often find myself looking at my grossly under-used collection with a tinge of guilt.

Many more minis
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
I'm not real big on minis games.  The imprecision of it bugs me too much.  No matter how careful you are when you put the ruler in front of your ship and move it, it can slide a couple millimeters.  Pieces can be bumped, firing arcs can be ambiguous, and you never know when one of these minuscule errors is going to alter the outcome of a game.  Now, I'm nowhere near OCD enough that this is going to stop me from playing, but still.

X-wing in general is pretty well-designed.  The point-buy system is relatively simple: select a ship, pick which 'level' you want (how skilled a pilot is going to be flying it), match the icons at the bottom of the card to any add-ons you want to include, and repeat for the other ships.  The game plays quickly and smoothy: set orders for your ships, then each one moves, does an action, and shoots in turn order.  They've done a great job keeping it customizable yet simple.

My only gripes are that I think some granularity's been lost along the way.  The ships roll 1-3 attack and evade dice, and have some mix of shields and hull points, as well as a list of maneuvers they can perform.  This means that as far as the game's concerned, a lot of the ships have very similar (or the same) stats.  An A-wing is the same firepower & maneuverability as a TIE fighter, as a TIE advanced, and an an E-wing is the same as a TIE interceptor, as a TIE defender.  Likewise, a B-wing is exactly as tough as a Y-wing, an E-wing the same as a TIE advanced, a λ shuttle as a YT-2400 freighter, etc.  When you're choosing between such small numerical ranges, you're going to get a lot of ships that feel awfully similar, differentiated only by special abilities and equipment load-outs.  There are some of these things that just [i]feel[/i] wrong, especially if you've played the video games.  A TIE phantom is no more maneuverable than the bomber?  A Y-wing no more than the shuttle?  The Millennium Falcon's shields are no stronger than a B-wing's?  These sorts of flavor quibbles are pretty minor, though.
What really frustrates me is the way the game handles (or fails to) the 3-D nature of a dogfight.  I'm fine with the fact that this is all played out in 2-D on a tabletop.  Not having differing 'heights' for the ships is additional complexity probably best left out.  However, the actual rules are way too restrictive, imo.  If you ever try to do a maneuver that you can't complete due to another model being in the way, you have to cut your move short, you lose your action, and you can't shoot at the ship in front of you.  That last part is fine; if you're assumed to be flying above/below the other ship, so you wouldn't have a clear shot at it.  But the fact that you can be penalized so heavily (basically losing your turn) for an action that should be completely normal in a dogfight (diverting a little above or below a passing ship) really irritates me.  You can't even declare your intent to do this if you think someone's going to get in your way.  All you can do is try and outguess them, which might not even be possible depending on the number of ships near you.  Oh, and I think it's nonsense that the ships going later in turn order (with ostensibly the greater piloting skill) are the ones more susceptible to this.

So, initially I was turned off to this game because there were only three star fighters included in the Core set. The game was completely off my radar when I happened upon the rules on FFG's website. I read through the rules and was very impressed by the simplicity. I decided to try a demo of the game while I was at Gen Con and I was very impressed with the game play. I ended up buying two Core sets and one each of the first expansions. The rules are easy to understand and explain. The minis are great looking in my opinion, and game play is fun. I was able to play this game with my 16 and 11 year old children and they had no issues comprehending the rules. If you're thinking about trying this game, give it a shot. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I wasn't.

Man, I really dig anything Star Wars related. With the release of this one, I don't know if I'm going to stop buying any of the expansions.

The models are beautiful to look at, and has decent paint job. Well done!

Bought the starter box and a few expansion blisters over the years.  Game is very bloated right now, pages and pages of faq's on how cards work.  can be a fun game when not played with "try hards". Can't stand playing it at local shops because over the over competitive attitude at the shops.

This game acted solely as a toy collection for a very long time until finally another friend of mine both his first pack. From then on we got hooked. It is indeed extremely good game of miniature space battles. Hidden movement selection is beautiful mechanic. Design is almost flawless. The biggest complain are somewhat clunky ship overlapping rules due to the lack of 3rd dimension. It's 2D space battle game with beautiful, lovely well known star wars space craft models. 
It's good 1 on 1, it's good with 3, 4, even 5 players. Scenario based, free for all or just plain skirmish, I don't see the point where we get tired of it.

Not perfect score because of the price (core set is not enough), money drain and above mentioned overlapping clunkiness.

[b]Update:[/b] Long setup and transportation issues when collection grew bigger caused me to lower the rating from 9 to 8.
[b]Update:[/b] Rating modified according to a custom rating system.

[b]Favorite mechanism:[/b] Secret simultaneous movement dial allocation for every ship is ingenious. It speeds up the game and it's making it intense and unpredictable.

When I first heard about this, my thought was I didn't care for Wings of War so I'm not interested in this. Boy was I wrong! Rules are straightforward, gameplay is smooth, and components are amazing.

I want to like this game (and I do) - I have just never really been drawn to tabletop games that require measuring, etc. The miniatures are cool but they are also expensive.

Fantastic game but tempered by the significant financial investment required to enjoy its full potential.  The perfect solution is to find someone else who owns it and play their copy.

Edit: the Tie swarm is so overpowered that it breaks the game at a competitive level. It wins too easily too often that if an opponent plays one the game will not offer any level of enjoyment for a rebel build. I've dropped my ranking from 8 and I have lost interest in playing after losing a dozen consecutive games against swarms. It isn't fun to turn up knowing you will only win if your opponent is poor AND you are lucky...

Full Squadron Building and Customization. Low Cost Tabletop Quality Pre-painted Miniatures. Easy to Learn Rules but Deep Strategy. Superb Suspense with Hidden Movement Dials. Fast Gameplay (1-1.5 hr for most common game size). Captures the Feel of being in a dogfight.

A Masterpiece in Game Design, but flawed in execution in terms of balance and replayability. The lack of standard scenarios (as compared to Armada for example) significantly affect replayability and limit loadouts. In terms of balance, FFG hasn't yet mastered balancing various abilities as they are released and usually relies on the next wave, months away, to balance current imbalances that they could easily balance with immediate erratas.

Extra sealed copy for trade.

Used to love the game, but got tired of paying for them to fix their mistakes.  That is, A-Wings sucked, and would have had to buy an aces pack to fix (still didn't really work).  TIE Advanced were under powered and would have had to buy an epic ship (which I don't even like/play) to fix.  TIE Bombers and TIE Defenders weren't really playable, so will have to buy another aces pack to fix.  Just not worth it anymore, especially given tournaments were endlessly long given required 75 minute rounds and how many rounds you had to play to accommodate larger groups (PLUS the cut to top 4-8).  10-14 hour game days were not fun, and felt unhealthy physically and mentally.

One of the few games that I also enjoy watching others play (that and Armada). 
One of my most favorite themes put on top of a solid (yet an itchy bit too simple) skirmish engine, what's not to like? 

I don't have the money nor the time to truly dig into it, so it'll remain on a 8. But once I get to play I enjoy the process from prepping the ships to finally blast the rebels out of the skies ;)

There are multiple layers of depth and strategy here. What ships you take into battle, what equipment you assign them, and then how you actually handle the tactical combat all adds together to make a cerebral challenge where you're always second guessing yourself while trying to read your opponent's mind. Plus, it's fun to make sound effects. PEW PEW!!! BWOOOOSH!!!

I used to have Wings of War so I knew what to expect, but I was impressed with the added features that give you more to think about than just when to Immelman. These include special powers you can use if you didn't choose a stressful flight path and different pilot abilities. I found the flight programming much more interesting as a result. Not anything I’d want to invest in unless I had children, but I’d happily play somebody else’s copy for some trash-talking and other mouth noises.

I love Star Wars, but I don't love all things Star Wars (see: Episodes I - III and the ridiculous number of poor computer translations, etc.) I have only rarely played miniatures games. I really enjoy SW:XW Miniatures and obviously it's partly due to the theme. It feels like your in a dogfight from the movies. But it's also a really well-designed game. Your favorite iconic characters are right there in the game and have interesting abilities to make them play a bit differently from the generic pilots of the same ships. Much of the strategy actually happens before the game begins during Squad Building. Fantasy Flight has designed endless combos of pilots and capabilities that you can try out on the playfield (at least, if you acquire a few expansion ships). The actual gameplay can get pretty chaotic due to hidden moves and difficulty you'll sometime have in lining up a shot. I imagine that a real-world dog fight has a similar feel however. I recommend 2 core sets both to have more TIEs and another X-Wing, but also b/c you'll double the number of dice on hand which frequently comes in handy. FF should have included several more of each die.

Fast and easy system, although a ton of bits. The dials make it easy to plot maneuvers for multiple ships (although about 6 ships seems to be my upper limit). They also remove the slow down involving using maneuver cards. To be fair, Wings of War fighters would seem to have more options for maneuverability. The point costs for fighters seems a little wacky. In order for the Rebels to use upgrade cards, the Imperials would seem to have to field way too many fighters. Still a good game.

The tactical positioning of X-wing was really intriguing to me, but the army-building aspect, meta-gaming, and dice-driven combat were all huge turnoffs.  The hits and dodges combo was especially aggravating, as you went back and forth trading "I hit!" ... "no you didn't!" and then came back for another pass.

I realized that better builds might make that less of an issue, but then you get into the point where you have to build fleets to make the game fun, and then the game is really happening before you play, and that usually bores the crud out of me.

The mini's are really nice and game play is simple to learn, however a few more scenarios would have been nice.

My FLGS is working on a deathstar trench run for its first tournament which is cool.

Scenario one seems very heavily slanted in favour of the rebels.
Scenario two seems heavily slanted in favour of the empire, as does scenario three.

Tie fighters are really hard to hit if they keep trying to evade and therefore its difficult to stop them if they have a mission that is not destroy.

I am a little dissappointed in the TIE fighter and X-wing packs as of the 6 "new" pilots and  4 "new" pilots  3 and 2 (half!) are the same as the base game pilots

A-wings are fast and fragile as they should be and man Y-wings can take some hits. The ion cannon seems disgustingly overpowered as it is an action to shoot it not a shoot, therefore you can effectively fire twice.
 
Millenium Falcon was won at the local Kessel run event :)

Imperial Aces purchased as surprise gift for b/f ;)

Whilst I am luke-warm on this game the B/f loves it and so has all the ships, many in multiple. Rather than try to keep up with the collection I will list it under just the base game.

This game is the perfect blend of movement and actions. The dice can prove to be a bit swingy, sometimes a ship just always rolls dodges despite your best planning to make sure everything is shooting at it. With all of expansions there is great list building options though the purchase method to get official cards can mean more ships than you want. One downside of the game is all of the tokens it requires to play.

The definitive dogfight miniatures game.  Star Wars theme is just icing on the cake.  Great customization options, excellent detail, deep strategy and mind games, always keeps you engaged.  Only gripe is that they're a bit stingy on the upgrade cards.  I proxy for casual, so it's no big deal.

Summary: Awesome, but outrageously expensive rip-off of Wings of War.

Rating history:
1st play: :star::star::star::star::nostar:

1st play: DEC/14. I think I would love playing this game regularly, but only if a friend foots the bill and buys up all the figures. This game is expensive!

The other thing that bugs me is how much it rips off Andrea Angelino's Wings of War. 

So I like this game, but can't afford it. My solution? Buy/trade for some Wings of War. =)

Update: My comment below still stands; however, Fantasy Flight has done a poor job of balancing the game, such that for at least one faction to remain competitive requires $100+ of new materiel. This is far below what an old-style miniatures game (Games Workshop style) would require; nonetheless, you have been cautioned.

The starter box is not sufficient to play a full game.

However, with selected additional ships, the game is very excellent and still well below traditional miniatures game pricing. Highly recommended.

Would give it a higher ranking, but storage is a little annoying so i gave it a 9.  Then getting people to play that are not crazily into it to where they have everything ever made of it...that is a challenge. The components are awesome, but difficult to keep all together unless you spend too much money for a specialized container.So the fiddliness and some aspects of the community make this game harder for me to play...so I gave it an 8.

the base game and ships were a lot of fun. however, they ruined the game with a constant stream of revenue seeking new models with special rules that break the game. it like all mini games becomes an exercise of list construction in order to maximize rules exploits to give an advantage before the game even begins.

I mean, does a board game collector/Star Wars fan have issues with addiction and collecting? I don't own them all so I guess not. *whistles*
I started with a simple goal, collect all the ships that flew in the PC game tie fighter, the best flight sim of all time as rated by me and Coruscant gamer magazine.
Even though they inexplicably replaced the TIE advanced with the prototype (TIE advanced has cutouts in the wings damn you!!)
Even though it took till now to release the Gunboat (star wing?? the hell name..)

The game is great. 2 person battle, decently fast (30-90 min) and lots of different techniques and strategies. Local tournaments are also a good time, even for a beginner like me. Web resources abound as player aids. 

The game can be simplified to play with your kids, or can get decently strategic.  Grab your favorite ships and get blasting!

After the Star Wars LCG left a very bad taste in my mouth, I wasn't sure X-Wing was going to be great. Happily, my hesitation was totally wrong - I love this game. It has occurred to me that the best way to play Star Wars is doing exactly that - going out in the backyard and having lightsaber duels or flying around plastic ships and blowing up your friend's plastic ships. The latter is, of course, exactly what this game is, taking the fun of playing with Star Wars toys and providing a standardized rule set, and it's a blast. The ships are so varied by now (Wave 6 is out, Wave 7 coming very soon) that getting into the game at this advanced stage is wonderful - I have one of everything, two of many things, and three or more of a few faves; so many that there is a lot of depth to building interesting fleets from game to game. This is gonna be tons of fun for a long time.

Overrated. I should love this game, but it just falls flat. I love Star Wars. My favorite character is Wedge Antilles. My favorite movie is Return of the Jedi. I usually fast forward to the huge space battle at the end to see the dogfights. I love miniatures and the miniatures are awesome looking for this game. The components are all top notch. It is simple to play. Very customizable. But, and this is the killer for me, you end up flying around in circles. You take a shot, then fly in a circle for a turn or 2, shoot again, repeat. I have played several games and they last way too long and are terribly boring. This does not capture the excitement of Star Wars dogfights for me at all. Sure it might be that I need to have more ships than the starter provides, but the starter should be able to stand on it's own and it doesn't

The stupidest tiniest little cards with tiny little writing on them I've seen yet, I hate FFG for these f*ucking cards.

[b]And 3 Mini's [/b] in the box set, really? Whoever made THAT decision is an asshole, just disgusting and really prompted me to rate it a 1. That is their WORST money grabbing move yet, and they are greedy bastards to begin with, not to mention its just a re-theme of Wings of War without improving it in anyway, its just a big luckfest. This is a total abuse of the theme, and grabbing the cow right from its tits

I will make it clear that other than putting money too far above making customers happy, I have nothing against FFG (well I hate those tiny cards) and think they make some awesome games (that are usually not play-tested enough) and want to see them continue to do so, but NOT in the way they made this game available.

The simultaneous hidden maneuvering mechanic and the bluffing is what makes this game so fun for me.

The fantastic miniatures are the saving grace of this otherwise rather unbalanced game, where luck is the most important skill you'll need. The battles are too messy and fiddly, with ships bumping into one another left and right. Even the tournaments show how the game plays slow and swings on a die roll. Not to mention that the game rests heavily on the purchase of multiple additional ships. It's to me a pretty disappointing use of the franchise, considering that the game had some potential, if only the designers had put less emphasis on dice rolls.

It's Ace of Aces on steroids. I do appreciate the built-in flight path tools, the customizable aspects and the quality of the models.    From a game play perspective, too much of game time is spent in reconciliation of movement.   
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game has lovely models which might be enough to get some SW fans buying this and fortunately they're just the icing on the cake to a solid set of rules. 

Good use of special abilities and equipment, once you get beyond the core set (it is a miniature game after all not a board game) the force-building rules means you can really put together a force to suit you play style and is ideally suited to campaign tracking of a squadron for those of us so inclined.

Games have had a good tension and no 'system killer' loopholes have appeared and the possibilities of new skills, ships, weapon cababilities and even maneuvers means that the game should stay fresh throughout it's life.


EDIT: Spring 2013. Game continues to impress with the wave 2 ships adding some nice alternatives and new challenges.

X-Wing is a great miniatures game.  The ships are so awesomely detailed and the components are supreme all the way. Beyond that, the mechanics keep things simple but there is just enough decision making to make game-play not feel random. X-Wing is a very good "boys' toys with rules" sort of game.  The enjoyment of this game is greatly heightened by being involved with the subject matter and writing a little story while playing. Keeps things fun. There are scenarios to help change things up beyond the normal dogfight if that begins to get stale.  The best thing about this game is that - unlike ANY miniature - you can have fun with 3 ships or 30 (if that's what you are in to).  But there is no requirement to spend hundreds of dollars on it to make a complete game.  The small skirmishes can be just as intense as an all out war. Kudos to Fantasy Flight for keeping things real.  Can't imagine ever wanting another miniatures game.

I've had a couple of games now. Basic rules are very simple and it even works pretty well playing with my 4-year old. To me it's a bit too simple but when using a couple of the optional rules, upgrade cards and playing a scenario it starts getting interesting. Best of all: This game really hits the table and gets played! There is practically no setup time if stored in a good way, it is easy to adjust gamelenght by adjusting pointsvalue and it works for all members of the family.

Moderately fun but this is probably the only game of this type that I'm ever going to play so I'm not really sure how to rate it in context of other Wings of War clones. 

It's Star Wars.  The ships look cool.  You can be tactical with them for a few minutes. Pew pew. 

Here's a riveting quote from the most popular review: "Do I spend my focus token to get that extra damage possibly in, or hold on to it to help me avoid possible damage?"

Oooh. Decisions decisions... ;)

After seeing the extra layer of rules that were added for "epic" play, though, I think I appreciate and prefer the simplicity of the original small-ship squadron rules.

This game hits the sweet spot for me, between the nerve-wrecking decision making of Miniature Wargames, and the easy accessibility of Boardgames.

If you are a fan of Star Wars you owe it to yourself to try this. It is amazing.

After MANY playthroughs, i'll drop the rating on this a little. It's good still, but what I have against it is a couple of things.

1.) Usually the first combat pass is often the game-deciding battle; few of my fights have twists with different players taking the leads at times.

2.) Some obvious Strategies are taking shape. Currently strength in numbers trumps Pilot skill; Quantity > Quality. I would hope to see that balanced out.

Here's to hoping for Wave 2.

RATING: 7
Part of me hates to give a game a 10 because I am a firm believer that nothing is perfect. But honestly, outside of the fact that there is no standard play mat and the starter box is ridiculously annoying with its cut out top, this game can do no wrong.

Such blind love for this game (its my #1) does deserve some explanation. So the reasons why the 10 is deserved:

1. Wife loves it and is always willing to play
2. Its just plain fun (rules are very well done and simple) and it gets "gotta get them all"   addicting. 
3. Its awesome trying to anticipate your opponent
4. The quality of the components are amazing!
5. My wife loves it!!!

Edit: after a couple of bad experiences that led to a game night flop, my love for this game deflated a bit. I actually went as far as to sell it off. I am still not sure whether I regret this or not and maybe that uncertainty means I did the right thing by deciding to stop adding ships to my collection and sell it instead.

Pros:
- I am finding this core set slightly more balanced than the Force Awakens one, with Luke Skywalker nowhere near as powerful as Poe Dameron
- There are slightly more unique characters than in the Force Awakens one, especially on the Empire side.

Cons:
- It took us some time to realise that the X-Wings in both core sets had different command dials. So it is not possible to get Luke Swylwalker sitting in a more modern X-Wing for instance. Same on the Empire side.
- ships in the Force Awakens core set have more movement options.
- the value vs cost ratio for the old ships, especially the X-Wing, is very different to the new core set, meaning that for a game with a set amount of points, you wouldn't choose most of the ships and pilots of this core set vs the pilots and ships of the new core set. I think FFG could fix this easily, by reducing the cost of the ships and pilots in this core set by a couple of points.

One game of Luke vs. two tie-fighters: it was a lot of fun and has very simple rules.  Looking forward to breaking out all of the ships.

I have two copies of the base game.  This is enough for me to field about 65 points, though maybe 50 if I didn't use my other expansions.  I have barely enough space to fill the boxes while keeping the insert.  
  This game is a tactical dog fight simulation.  You command a squad of Star Wars themed fighters in a two dimensional shoot out, where out maneuvering your opponent is the difference between victory and defeat.  There is an element of luck to this game, but as quantity of shots matters most, luck is on the side of the aggressor. 
  The main problem with this game is it's price. Depending on how tricked out you want your fleet to be, you can easily drop hundreds of dollars on ships.

I really like this game. I've been playing it casually since it was released, and each time it is just as fun. The simultaneous choosing of the round's movements at the beginning of the round is what really makes this game shine. The "planned chaos" of each game is fun whether you win or lose.

Ship maneuvering and customization are unlike anything I have seen before in a miniatures game before.  These Star Wars ships are also beautifully modeled and painted in great detail (but also very fragile).  As long as you can get over the fact that movement is dependent upon a player's own hand-eye coordination (and not everyone can, myself included at times).

When X-Wing first was announced, I will admit I was a bit underwhelmed and, quite frankly, the game did not appeal to me at all.

However, as time passed and more expansion packs were released, X-Wing kept growing in popularity not only among the gaming community as a whole, but also for me personally.

Eventually, the game had become this "monstrosity" with a sea of expansions. X-Wing was featured on TableTop. My son kept carefully bringing up the question time and time again: "Are we going to get X-Wing?" A friend of mine kept asking the same thing. It was this odd paradox where it was becoming harder to resist buying into X-Wing, but also easier, since — knowing myself — I knew I would want to "have it all", were I to jump in, and that would get expensive fast.

In the end, I decided that I was not going to play X-Wing, that I was perfectly fine with "just" Imperial Assault, and that I had plenty of other games to enjoy.

And then — "stuff" happened ...

While I'm undecided as to whether I should thank you or curse you (whoever you are), my son thanks you. And, for that, I, too, thank you!

RATING: 10
Rates above Armada simply for the ease of play although I enjoy playing Armada more. The game is starting to suffer from serious power creep these days though and the errata is starting to get meaty. That stated, this game has so much momentum behind it and is such a cash cow for FFG (for very good reasons) I can't see expansions slowing down for quite a while yet. It could really do with a campaign expansion (ala the one for Armada) and really needs to get away from everything being tournament centric.

I love the minis, and the mechanics of the game & components are very nice as well.  I expect to buy expansions and continue to play (have played about 3-4 times now).  However, the scenarios that come with the game are not balanced and do not appear to have been fully playtested.  So my husband and I bought a set of WWI dogfighting scenarios and he's been working on adapting them for X-Wing.  We've tried one so far, and it seems to have been an improvement over the scenarios provided with the game, but there are still some balance issues.  I think to have a chance, TIE fighters should adhere to standard Imperial doctrine of 3-1 odds against Rebel fighters... even when the Rebels have a separate objective to distract them!  Otherwise the TIEs just can't last!

RATING: 8
Excellent lite miniatures skirmish wargame. Players secretly select how their ship (X-wing or Tie fighter) will move and then resolve shooting using a simple to-hit and save mechanic (using nice custom engraved dice) and applying several modifers that players must choose depending on their assesment of the tactical situation. Much of the game play is in out-guessing your opponent's movement choices to line up your ship for close range shots while avoiding them doing that to you.

Building and customizing your squadron for battle is a key component of the game (the meta-game).

Very good for multi-player per side battles.

Play is quick, the included pre-painted ships are excellent (although perhaps a bit expensive) as are all the chits and movement tokens. This is not a serious space combat simulation. Great fun!

RATING: 6
Amazing miniatures, nice gameplay that isn't too cumbersome so it the game moves at a decent pace. BUT-- this game would get old to me quickly because I am just not into dogfight games I think. Sparring with minis can only keep my interest going for so long. Still, if you are into this type of game, then this certainly seems like a good system with good production.

I love this game and I don't get to play it nearly enough. Simple enough to banish all the worries about Warhammer-esque tomes of rules, but with enough tactical depth to keep it interesting. Squad building, dice rolling, dogfighting; it's all good. So much opportunity for burning cash on shiny, pretty miniatures though... Oh god the next wave is coming out soon... my poor wallet.

Bought before 2012 holidays. Played with my 2 grown sons. Simpler than I expected. Well done by FFG to streamline something as complex as ship to ship miniatures combat to a couple of pages of rules and components that remove much of the movement calculations. Easy to learn, easy to play. And fun. We bought a 3ft by 3ft "Space/Stars" cloth from Walmart sewing dept as a table overlay and it really adds to the visual effect. We have just the base game, and though we can play a few battles for fun for about an hour or so, after that we are hungry for a deeper game and move on. But taken for what it is, we enjoy the times we spent with it and will be back for more...and perhaps a couple of expansions, including Han Solo's ship.

Simple, easy accessible "beer and pretzels" style miniatures game that is weighted down by way too many bland expansions and the unwillingness of FFG to fix imbalances in other ways than by releasing yet another expansion.   

Fun and simple..  

I find the 100 point tournament format (Standard) extremely repetitive and boring..  This game is for me at its best when playing campaigns, scenarios and epic format which i enjoy.

For tournaments i play Armada instead which IMHO is a MUCH better (but way heavier) game ..

Also: Expect expenses...

The best competitive miniatures game at the moment. Short playtime makes it easy to fit in to your schedule and you only need a couple of ships at a time so carrying the squadron around is not a problem.

Mechanically, it is very solid. Using templates to move precisely keeps unnecessary arguments to a minimum. Rulebook (webpage version) and errata answer every question if the players just look them over.

FFG reacts to OP builds and tries actively to boost less flown ships with new upgrades. The game is very well balanced at the moment.

AUG 2017 EDIT: The design of the new ships is beginning to falter. The competitive side is more and more dependent on abusing the right card combos than careful flying. The game is still very good but high-level games are not as satisfying anymore to watch or play.

 Probably I should rate this game a 9, because it is great. 
But FFG decided to sell things in a customer unfriendly way to maximize profit. F.i.  You want to have a specific upgrade Card but not this ship it is sold with, bad luck!
 Also pilots are attached to a single ship, don't you think that Skywalker would be able to pilot different ships?
 Also missions are only available with bigger boxes, not separately.
You get each three dice for attacker and defender, but already in the base game it is possible to use 4 dice each.  On the other side you will get a bunch of numbered tokens that you don't use unless you buy expansions.

UPDATE OCT 2, 2015:
I am back to enjoying this game, after a couple of recent sessions that really clicked. For one thing, the new Scum and Villainy faction acts as a counterbalance to the original teams: borrowing upgrade  cards between the three factions feels fun and thematic. I wouldn't want to juggle another system like this, but for now, I'm uping the grade, and working out ways to integrate it with my painted Imperial Assault set.

UPDATE OCT 14 2014: Features a problem inherent in many Fantasy Flight games. One player says Boom! Ha! Got you dead to rights! And another player says, "nope, because I have this teeny little card here that a person who dropped out of engineering school to play magic professionally before he went on to design games at Fantasy Flight says gives me a plus one defense that only triggers on the rare occasion when your plus one gives you a plus one on your plus one. So you missed." Thus, five minutes go by as you check the rules. I hear that people at Fantasy Flight aren't even compensated that well, they just like to plus one people to death.

--

Noooooooooo! This is money I don't have. And it's almost worth the money.

Then again, as someone with very little interest in Star Wars "deep cuts," I'm already looking at Wave Three ships and saying, "so, what's that, a bottle opener?" Wither the franchise?

EDIT Excellent game.  The more I play it, the more I want to play.  This game really capture the spirit of the old X-wing series of video game (my favorite being of course TIE Fighter).  The miniatures looks cool on the table and are nicely painted.  The rules are very easy to understand but not simplistic (I only regret there is no bonus attack when firing in the back arc of another ship).  The game is expensive when you want to start collecting ships but every new ship add something new to the table.  With all the new content coming up, it's going to probably cost me some money again but hey, when you love something, you don't count the cost!

A fun little game with excellent production values. A potential money pit, and (like many FFG games), it's too fiddly and long for the tactical depth on offer. Do we really need so many counter types, for example?

However, it is a solid game of anticipation, manoeuvre and attack.

June 2015: I just don't like it enough to want to play it again. It's a lot of fiddle (set-up, storage, etc.) and far too long for what it is, despite the neat manoeuvring mechanic. I just never feel like I have a decent amount of control over the proceedings (the ship selection, the dice and luck in where your opponent moves all play a huge part). Now I've both lost and won it, I can see it's a good game, but it just leaves me cold (win or lose), and actually *bored*, now that I've got used to the flashy presentation.

It's a dogfight in a box.

This was my first foray into tabletop wargaming, and I could not be more pleased with the gameplay.

It combines the best elements of deckbuilding with a brilliant tactical maneuvering engine that is deceptively simple to pick up, yet takes time to master.

The theme is absolutely on point - the glorious space combat of the Star Wars original trilogy; with the odd detour into expanded universe territory.  The models are beautifully pre-painted, if a touch fragile at the "joints."

It's all about finding synergy between the various pilots, upgrades, and ships - and then being able to execute that gameplan in a dynamic environment.

I have to deduct a point from it for one simple reason:  The out-of-box experience is woefully insufficient.  You can't even run a proper 100pt squad game with the core set.  I automatically deduct a point from all my ratings if a game's core set comes with the recommendation to buy a second one to get started.  I'd rather pay more for a beefier core set with more options than that first taste to get you hooked and dropping cash on the expansions.

Marketing aside, this is a phenomenal title.  Every person I have introduced this to wants to play it again, and that's as strong a recommendation as I can think of.

Interesting movement with the templates. I've played some amount of miniature games in the past, but this one seems like more outright fun from a non-competitive standpoint than those have. As we're starting to get stronger lists going the game's depth has started to show more, loving the mechanics, can't find much of a flaw yet. As we're now approaching much stronger lists the games are still getting more interesting and tactical. 

I can get over dice in miniature games, but still get frustrated with them at times. While the movement is interesting the templates can be a bit finicky. We've had a few issues with the quality of the stands and having [-]3[/-] 4 of them snap on us. 

[-]Now that we're up to 100 point lists but still learning it's starting to be a bit slow, this feels like it'll be remedied with more practice.[/-] 
We have indeed gotten better at faster play, I feel like I need to set a tournament clock up though, just to make sure we keep improving our pace.

Have a lot of stuff

A fun "move 'n' shoot" game set in the Star Wars Universe.  The base game doesn't stand too well alone, as the 3 ships just aren't enough to do anything terribly complicated with.  But within the game there is a great simplicity and accessibility that shows the system is sound.

This is a fun game that's easy to pick up. At first it seems too complicated and fiddly, but not all of those hundres of pieces and cards will be used when you play. It's a thrill to outmanuever your opponent, or cry foul when your opponent rolls nothing but hits. The rules are very well written, the components are (of course) phenomenal, and the game is highly recommended, even for those who are indifferent to Star Wars. UPDATE: I keep playing this game, again and again, for 2 years now. It's time I upped my score to a 9.

Probably the best streamlined "wargame" with miniatures out there. Unfortunately it business model not only makes you buy expansions, it makes you buy the expansions of the army you do not play as, just for the cards. For Star Wars Fanatics though, that may be a complete treat.
Solid system, absolutely recommend.
Do not try to play with more than 2 players though, it simply isn't worth it.

The ships, the pilots and the bravado is well captured in X-wing Miniatures. Rules simple enough to dive right in, meaningful decisions and tactics will keep serious gamers coming back

Big negative is not enough dice in the base set, and have to do a re roll in some situations. Never ending expansions to make yourself competitive detracts from an otherwise great game.

Solid 7.5.

Awesome miniatures; really the best I have seen for the price point.  IMHO, the cost, while not cheap, compares very favorably to other games with minis that are typically not painted, unassembled, and don't come with cards, counters, and stands.

Great theme; it simulates the fiction to a tee.

Easy play; after half a game you get the rules and are thinking about how to play well.

Fast play; reasonable size scenarios play out within 2 hours.

Decent depth; no, it isn't Whistling Death, but the combination of plotted moves, actions, special pilots, and buff cards keeps things interesting.  Missions, as opposed to straight-up duels, also add alot of depth.

Downsides:  I don't think the 100-pt 1:1 duel format is all that much fun, esp. the rebel vs. rebel and imperial vs. imperial battles.  The real fun is multiple players on each side in a big battle with some type of scenario to drive things, rather than just a cage-match.  If I rated the game based on the tournament scene, it would not be '10', it might be a '7' or lower.

I watched the movies twice in my life, and I used to find the star wars universe pretty cool, until now... because now I'm surrounded by starwars. ¬¬

You see, since I bought the game, it seems like it has changed me. I started to read more about the pilots and stories inside the main story; I bought the x-wing book series (I don't like to read books, but now I do); I bought a joystick to play x-wing :alliance (And I'm having so much fun); And I caught myself looking for a rebel pilot helmet; seriously.

So thanks, I have to recognize you did a great job, and I have to give this game a 10/10.

Edit: More games played and more factions coming out. From 9 to 10. This is how I wish Warhammer and Warhammer 40K was produced.

I love: The theme, the miniatures, the easy to use rules and template and the 1 model = many different pilots cards system of many different points value.

I don't mind: the dice randomness, the occasional Tie fighter blowing up very quickly and the small cards.
The price can seem to be a problem, until one realizes that it is cheaper than most other miniature games. 

The cons: X-wing suffers from a MTG effect, whereby some cards can only be found with some ships. Therefore, for total flexibility, you may want to buy all expansion ships at least once, even if you will not use them. Not a problem for casual play though, since you probably won't be making ultimate lists.

RATING: 9.4
The two paragraphs below are my original thoughts. After more plays somehow the game has just clicked. Randomness can be mitigated a great deal via movement and action allocation strategies. There are also some very nice synergies that can be utilized between various ship, pilot, and weapon combos. Now this may be my favorite 2 player game. We even played with 3 and it was great (2 guys played Imperial with 50 points each and the other guy got 100 as rebels). Setup is still a bear, so when we play it we usually plan to play 2 or 3 matches in a row only making minor adjustments in between. This gives me the "bang for my setup buck" that knocked the game for at first. 

This is not the worst game I have played, and I continue to get roped in to playing because my buddy has so much invested in the system. The game is just too clunky for what it is. 2 copies of the base game and numerous expansions equal loads of cards, tokens, etc to deal with. Setting up a basic 100 point game takes 15-30 minutes between unpacking, picking your pilots, secondary weapons, etc. Play can take anywhere from 30-60 minutes depending on strategy and dice. That is precisely the problem. I don't mind longer games where the dice can be mitigated (Stone Age, Yggdrasil, and Robinson Crusoe come to mind), but in this game they can't. So you spend all this time dragging hundreds of pieces out, crafting your ships, only to get 30 minutes in to the game and be blown away by incredibly bad or good die rolls. That is simply not fun.

The minis are well done and the rest of the components are nice quality, typical FF. Also, you can setup basic scenarios rather quickly that play in 15 minutes, so it is possible to have a 30 minute time from breaking it out to finishing a quick match, but these scenarios get old rather quickly. The escort the senator scenario, for example, basically consists of the rebel driving the senator straight across the table while the imperial side hopes to get lucky enough on die rolls to take him out. After many plays the die rolls do seem do even out some. Neither one of us win on a regular basis regardless of the strategy we use. I consider this to be a negative, however, as I would rather win based on strategical merit and good decision making than die rolls.

entre Yera y Ray deben tener como 5 o 6 cajas basicas, y unas 40 o 50 naves CADA UNO (de muchas de las naves 2, 3 o mas copias, incluso de las "medianas"). aparte de eso, Yera tiene las epicas (las "enormes", que se usan en partidas especificas con 2 tableros). necesitaria una tabla de la lista solo para poner todas las naves. y sinceramente, paso. :p 

dogfight puro y duro. con minis bonitas y coleccionables, y sistema para montarte tu escuadron a medida con diversidad de naves y opciones (casi todo comprando aparte, ZASCA!)

el juego basico trae 1 Xwing y 2 TIE basicos y con eso te puedes montar un 1vs1 y algunas misioncillas (tres). para aprender esta bien, pero con el juego basico en tres partidas te quedas con hambre ya. xD (ahi es donde luego te clavan bien clavao). 

el juego en cuanto a jugabilidad y normas es sencillo y directo, alguna que otra se nota que fueron a no complicarse la vida. 

muy buen juego pero "sabiendo lo que hay"

As far as nearly mass market minis games go, you could do a lot worse. FFG handles the meta with all the delicacy and precision of a jackhammer, though, which is obnoxious. but the balance is mostly okay. 
The theme doesn't do much for me, but I accept that I am in the minority on this one.
[EDIT] I'm now definitively done with X-Wing. FFG just can't handle a competitive meta at all--their preferred solution to perceived imbalances is to clumsily nerf things into the ground, lumbering from one post-tournament kludge after another. The JumpMaster has seen what, four successive revisions? 
Setting all that aside, though, to play the game well seems to involve denying your opponent the ability to play much at all. Building a good list is too often about ensuring that your gaming partner doesn't get to have fun (stress, tractors, bumping, arc dodging, etc.), and that's a huge turn-off for me.

Having played this a couple of times, it is a very good game but I don't really understand the hype.  I guess I am underestimating how great this is if you are a star wars fanboy.  

Downsides- total money pit with inflated costs-as-is, downtime becomes progressively worse every time you add another person, and in my opinion, the replayability is entirely dependent on buying more and more stuff for it.

Upsides - easy for what it is, a great two player experience with beautiful pieces that would appeal a lot to nongamers.  This is the sort of thing that gets people moving from buying an occasional something at target into being full on hobby board gamers and I appreciate that even if I don't want to stick my penis in this game box, which seems to be the general status of many star trek fanboy board gamers who have played this game.  Mechanically it is a streamlined system borrowed from Wings of War, another great game, with some extra stars warsy stuff tacked on.

Had a large collection but sold the lot as I came to the conclusion that the game was exclusively made to be a Power Gamers wet dream. I fuckin hate power gamers!

I got really fed up with buying so many ships and cards that you will never use as they are just not competitive. 
Without a ton of push the limit cards, you were nobody! It became a pointless game to own outside of the tournament scene.
When I sold everything @ the end of wave 3, the only viable empire build was the flying house brick, wall of tie's, swarm. Dull & dull & really fucking dull.
The idea of "rolling, turning, diving, going in again", thematically dogfighting in an infinite 3d space, appeared to be a complete joke

-------------------

Update, A new hope! 
Returned to the system when the revised core set piqued my interest again. After some research it seems from Imperial Aces onwards, a lot of retrospective cards started being released to make all the unworthy ships viable prospects again, and even fun to fly. Typical FFG this, play testing is always done by the fans long after the products are out there. But all the hot fixes have brought me back to the game, and I'm regrowing my collection of mainly, all now interesting to incorporate, ships. I have a regular casual play partner keen to dabble with 100 pt fun builds plus large scale home made scenarios. Things are thankfully rosey again it the X-wing garden!

RATING: 7
Despite my general dislike of the Wings of War series (and games with measuring in general), the theme intrigued me enough to give this one a shot. In general, I was pleasantly surprised. 

Each player receives a fleet of various ships and cards to go with them. Giving each ship a special ability provides excellent flavor and army-building potential, even before adding in the upgrade cards. Players will then plan their movement, with more difficult maneuvers putting strain on the ship such that it must make an easy maneuver before attempting another difficult one. Players must also decide whether to have their ships get defensive bonuses, dice bonuses, extra maneuvers, etc. All these choices do a good job of creating depth without feeling overwhelming. 

What really sets this apart from Wings of War (and makes it better) is the vast amount of units involved. A failed bluff or missed read in a game involving one-on-one combat can be absolutely disastrous. Spreading these bluffs over a whole fleet though creates an experience much more towards the middle of the bell curve. It seems to better reward bluffing in balance with tactical movement. That said, the endgame is weak because of this. Once players are down to only a ship or two each, the decisions are much less interesting. It's an oddly anti-climactic game. Another minor drawback, but easily houseruled, is the prohibition on pre-measuring before moving. Rewarding spatial and estimating skills seems very out of place in a game of tactical movement and dice rolling. 

Despite the comparatively boring late game, the frantic early action is very exciting. The pilots for each ship make it easy to personify the action, which is very fun. This is a game that seems to really require customization to be at its best and should lend itself well to tournament play. But for the kitchen table, someone with an interest in constructing these fleets will be a virtual necessity.

Epic survival by X-Wing Rookie 2, down to 4 Rebels vs just Vader, who evades about 7 hits from the Rebel ships then Vader finally finishes off Rookie 2 and then takes out the unscathed A-Wing in one shot with proton rockets! Then strips the shields off Rookie 1! But then finally dies.

Way too much fuss for so little return.

2013-08-13: Hey, it's Star Wars! And it really feels like Star Wars, too. Quite a bit like the video games of old. In fact, very much like those. And the Falcon and the A-Wing and the TIE Interceptor (which is my absolute favorite) just came out, too, and I'm sure the TIE Bomber and the B-Wing will be next. My collection might just be complete with those; I'll definitely get less than "as many as required to fill 100 points with the cheapest pilot" with any other ship any more.

2016-06-12: Update three years later: Well, I'm still collecting the crazy stuff. And until half a year ago or so, I regularly played the game, too. Currently, I'm playing a bit less (not at all for some months now), and that's a huge pity. The game is still awesome as ever, in fact, even more awesome because of the humongous variety that it offers. Balance is still great. The main issue for new players is probably the high buy-in, but competitive squadrons can be had relatively cheap when you know what you're aiming for.

I didn't find the gameplay particularly engaging and I detest the business model of having to invest a lot of money into a handful of plastic ships and a few accessories to play the game on a reasonable level. That its cheaper than things like Warhammer is true, but its still a vicious money sink. 
If they released a full point list that's competitive for 2 players in a single box for 50-80$ that would have been reasonable. 
The fact is, these paint jobs and minitures are not all that special. We'be been looking at SW now for 40 years. If I was to invest in a fleet game, it would at least have to offer something new.

Well, I you consider universe and material quality as a second factor, now I have tested Star Trek Attack Wing rules and scenarios; X-Wing interest while quite good ranks behind.

Despite mini quality X-wing could became quickly boresome as it lacks scenario or rules variety.

Just super fun! Easy to learn, quick to play, great looking minis. Customization options. Only point that would hold people from buying it is the $$ you will spend on all the expansion packs you will want. Great tactical fun, cool Star Wars theme, I don't know what else people could want.

(April 2014) If only I could play more I am sure this game would rise in my rankings :(  Great tactical combat system - lots of varied squad building options, but too few players in my parts...

(May 2014) Played several more games this month and I am becoming more and more frustrated with the dice fest of luck. There are seemingly times where one just cannot mitigate the luck of the roll and its supremely frustrating...

(May 2016) I haven't played since 2014... not a good sign.  At this point I'm holding out for my son to grow up.

It's an okay streamlined table-top game. It dosen't take hours in preparation or play.

But it is pretty light.. there is very little strategic depth. The spacecrafts are not very diverse, the board offers no change except meteors & the customiziation is too limited. It is all about maneuvering.. a little bluffing & a lot of eye measurement-skill.

In the end not enough meat for me.
I also find sci-fi not too interesting, so the theme isn't doing it for me either..

Too many ships released too fast changing the game way too much.  Old ships become obsolete, new ships are gimmicky and better than older ships.  In short, Magic the Gathering with a miniature interface.  I was a fan for the first 3 years and now I don't want to play.

I didn't expect much from this game. The randomness is balanced in a way that can cause you to go several rounds without scoring a hit. At first this may be frustrating, but it does simulate a space dogfight well enough. (Considering they're a made up concept at this point.) Still, once you get over that initial shock of slightly higher miss ratios than you might expect the game is solid simple fun.

I love playing the Y-wings.

GAMEPLAY
The X-Wing Miniatures Game brings the dog fighting action of the Star Wars Universe to the tabletop, Specifically the Episodes 4, 5, and 6 timeframe. The game flows well from turn to turn as the game turn has four phases. One, Planning phase, secretly choose your ships’ movement. Two, Activation phase, move your ships and perform an action to help your ship survive and improve your chances to hit. Three, Combat phase, resolve you shooting for the turn. Four, End phase, clean up the game space. The planning phase offers a fun battle of wits with your opponent as your try to predict their moves and line up you shots. Each class of ship is restricted in their choices of manuevers. The Tie Fighters are fast but have restrictions on short turns with no shields. The X-Wings are generally mobile and have some shields. The Y-Wings are slow very durable and have lots of shield. Most of the turn is spent during the combat phase to resolve shooting. Ships have attack and defense dice. The die rolls can be modified by actions and pilots special abilities. Damage points are scored on each ship and critical hits will cause disruptions to the ship and the pilot.

X-Wing immerses you in the Star Wars setting and gives a fun fast gameplay experience. Having the game in two dimensions was clearly in the interest of keeping the game moving. A more hardcore dogfighting simulation can be found in Wings of Glory a WWII miniature game (Which I also recommend).

COMPONENTS
The models are well detailed, simply painted models. If you are a model painter the painting can easily be improved on, but the out of the box quality will have most fans smiling. The expected high quality Fantasy flight production is in evidence here, thick cardboard for the movement rulers, everything is easy to read, and the art is top notch. All of the stats and abilities are clear and easy to distinguish on the pilot cards.

THEME
Full of star wars. Get to fly as your favorite character from the movie when you are the good guys, Luke and Biggs. While playing the imperials the pilots get sufficiently generic evil names such as Mauler Mithel and Night Beast. The first wave of expansions add Characters with each ship including Wedge and Darth Vader. The Second coming early 2013 will add the Millennium Falcon and Slave one.

WHO IS IT FOR?
Anyone who loves Star Wars will enjoy this game. Players 10 and up can enjoy the game. The quick turns will keep younger players engaged.

The game out of the box will let players experience three basic scenarios which are all fun and different to play. Be for-warned though. As with most miniatures games, to play larger more spectacular battles, multiple expansions are necessary. The game recommends battle of 100 points. Each pilot card has a point value with weapon and droid upgrades available. 100 points battle require between four and six ships per side. The base set comes with 1 X-Wing and 2 Tie Fighters.

(12/19/2015) Comment based on one play.

This is a great miniatures game that conveys the feel of a dogfight in the Star Wars universe. The designer has managed to take the basic mechanisms from Wings of War and improve upon them, to make a fast-playing, intense, and completely customizable game.

I played Wings of War nearly eight years ago, and was annoyed at the lack of consistency of the maneuvering through the use of cards. The play seemed forced and artificial, with a rather sloppy tolerance. In X-Wing, there are sets of maneuvering gauges that help with the movement of the models. Movement usually follows a 0 deg, 45 deg, or 90 deg turn, along with a movement "speed" ranging from 1 to 5 units. The desired maneuver gauge is placed in front of the base of the model. The model is then moved to the other end of the gauge, such that the aft of the base of the model touches the end.

What is a stroke of genius is the inclusion of "maneuver dials", similar to the sailing dials in Pirate's Cove, where each player secretly and simultaneously selects one of a handful of maneuvers. Every fighter in the game has a unique dial, each with a limited menu of basic and advanced maneuvers. The players, in initiative order reveal and execute their maneuver, along with selecting an action, such as focusing, target lock, evasion, or barrel rolling. If an enemy fighter is within their field of vision, they roll a number of attack dice depending on their fighter. The target also rolls a number of defense dice depending on their fighter as well. Hits are negated with evasion. Resulting hits are applied against shields and structure ratings of the target fighter.

With only two or three "hit points" per fighter, an introductory 2 vs 1 dogfight can be concluded in 30 minutes or less. The play is quick, but the spatial and vector decisions involved can be challenging--one really feels like they are flying an X-Wing or a TIE fighter! There is an element of luck with the dice throws, but thematically makes sense. Rules are short and easy to explain, and the game concepts are not that complicated. This is a good introduction to the world of miniatures gaming, due to the clean, simple rules, along with tools that allow for precise plotting. Initial rating is "8". I think this system has great promise, but realize it is a collectible. If a friend has it, I'll gladly play it, but will not spend a cent to get addicted to this gamer crack.

I'm not really a [i]Star Wars[/i] fan—it's just that 89% of my childhood consisted of nothing but [i]Star Wars[/i], [i]The Empire Strikes Back[/i] and [i]Return of the Jedi[/i].  I was 10 when my Mom took me and a friend to see some weird space movie on opening day...  If you were near that age and walked into it blind—[i]with a completely naked psyche[/i]—you get it.  It was like being pulled hot off the anvil and thrust into a screaming slave's belly...  Tempered in death and rebirth; shocking and permanently formative.  A fulcrum point for generational shift.

As a kid I built X-wing and TIE fighter model kits until my fingers bled and I hallucinated glue-fume Jawas; I would have strangled the children & little people inside the rough brown cloaks with my inflatable lightsaber for a game like this.  (Still would.)  So to say that the perfectly detailed, tiny model ships resonate would be a massive understatement.

Again, I am not a fan; I find anything other than the original three movies—the "Expanded Universe", crappy novelizations, comics, Prequels, video games, etc., etc., ad nauseam—to be baby laxative.

But [i]X-Wing[/i] is the pure, uncut stuff, a high as dangerous as time travel and I'm 10 again.

The same concept as Wings of War, but much better designed and with a much cooler theme.

X-Wing offers a DECENT damage probability distribution. As dice results are compared, the distribution is closer to gaussian, whereas in Wings of War there are too many zeroes and too many nasty cards (the auto-kill, fives, etc...) that bring high-variance nasty randomness.

X-Wing offers a lot more control, as you plan every move after your last move. In WoW, you plan three moves after your last three moves: no one can predict the opponent's third movement, and planes usually do weird things and engaging an enemy is very difficult, wasting your time flying in circles.

X-Wing offers a lot of mechanical variety, reusing the same miniature with different stats thanks to the Pilot cards. Wings of War does the exact opposite, having lots of redundant miniatures with the bloody same stats. No Pilot distinction in a game called "Famous Aces"? How is that?

X-Wing gets rid of the inconvenience of using cards to plan your maneuvers. The slider disks are perfect to plan your movement. 

X-Wing is the game that Wings of War should had been. 

I have:

2 X-Wings
2 Y-Wings
2 A-Wings
2 B-Wings

4 TIE
2 TIE-Advanced
2 TIE-Interceptor
1 TIE-Bomber

1 Millenium Falcon

Taking the dogfighting action from the original trilogy, X-Wing puts you in command of 1 Incom T-65 (Alliance) or 2 Twin Ion Engine Galactic Starfighter (Empire).

Pros:
+ Easy to learn mechanics and Combat
+ Point based squad building adds balance to both sides
+ Complete with all components needed to play included scenarios 

Cons:
- Needs extra dice to play (sold separately) 
- More ships are needed to better enjoy suad(drone) building.

After a few plays, the compounded dice rolling got to me. The game seems longer than it needs to be just because of dice rolls. I'm looking forward to playing Armada, which seems more strategic (albeit more expensive) than this game. 

This is still a fun one, but I won't be investing any more into it (except maybe to get the Slave 1, Imperial transport, and an A wing, which are the original trilogy ships that I don't have). I'll play it purely for fan service once the movies come out I'm sure :)

I'm not really a miniatures fan but I'll admit that the pre-painted ships are nice (presuming you're willing to re-mortgage your house in order to buy them all) and the movement mechanism is as smooth and clever as it is unoriginal.

My only real problem with the game is that I think that the multitude of card options gets in the way more than it contributes to what's otherwise quite a decent, light wargame. Obviously the cards lend a great deal of variety and I'm sure they're great if you want that collectible deck building feel but that's just not an element I'm very interested in seeing in a tactical miniatures game.

This was such a fun game to learn. It comes with two rule books; condensed and elaborate. The game is beautifully designed so that you can start playing immediately. And that is very appealing because the miniatures in this game are phenomenal. I can't praise this game enough for its high quality components. And since everyone knows at least something of the Star Wars universe, it's easy for new players to jump right in.

One side plays the Empire, the other plays the Rebels. This is a tactical miniatures game where movement is key. Like most miniatures games, both sides agree to an allotted set amount of points. You then spend these points building up a squadron of different ships, pilots, and upgrades. The more skilled the pilot...the more points you'll have to spend. But you just might want to because the person with the highest pilot skill gets to move last, and shoot first. Whereas taking a lot of lower skilled pilots lets you have that many more opportunities to fire each turn.

The customizable nature of this game gives it great replayability. You'll never play the same game twice.

A great miniatures game -- probably my favorite.  The concept and maneuvering is great, but I think at this late stage it costs a lot of money to get in, and the ships are now so far from the movies that it doesn't feel much different from a generic space miniature game.

Reminds me of the Mustangs game I have / had (selling it atm). Fun dogfight goodness. A bit pricy if you want to have really good time with lists etc. That's a huge drop in points for me.

The only thing that bugs me is the sheer number of ships that comes out... Being a completionist, this is getting out of hand so I decided to stop at up to scale minis... Everything else is a no go for me right now... Doesn't get as much playing time as I'd like, though everyone seems to be up for it whenever I bring this one out (rarely).

Terrific miniatures game.  Very streamlined rules and play, but enough options to customize your squad as you see fit.  Plays quick.  Even has some cool missions and possibly a campaign mode on the way.

Started as a birthday gift from Michelle (purchased from 401 Games and GermanGames), November 2012.  Now Have 3x core sets and the following expansions:
1x X-wing expansion (custom painted = added R2-D2)

The design and execution just makes me straight-up smile. Full disclosure that I am one of the biggest Star Wars fans anywhere, but I don't think that matters if you want a great game.

The miniatures look great, especially for the cost, and this is maybe the most rewarding AND accessible miniatures game I know of for someone just getting into the genre. Admittedly, it is not an all-in-one box miniatures game, but the depth you get is superb with the different units.

Combat and play dynamics are very fun, with enough luck present, but still skills backing it up. I love the different cards for pilots and upgrades and the dynamics of rolls for hits, evasion and other tactics.

It is also quite fun to put together a storage kit for the game and even your own regulation 3'x3' board. I painted and laminated my own with a black background and space illustrations.

This game is perfect and wears well. PS - be prepared to spend at least $150, in my opinion, to eventually get enough components for long-term lasting interest, although the starter will definitely let you determine if you will like it or not.

Star Wars: X-Wing started out as an awesome game but has now suffered from the vast number of expansions.  With each expansion comes a plethora of cards.  These cards, and the combinations they form, are now far more important than the flying itself.  This has turned the game in to Magic: The Gathering, Star Wars edition.  This is a shame as the game used to be so good.

Such a fun game! The mechanics are simple, the miniatures are amazing, and the gameplay is quick and fierce. However, I don't know where the game will go after the next few months: almost all of the widely recognizable ships (read profitable expansions) will have been made and the Organized Play aspect seems non-existent at this point.  While it is probably inevitable that the Prequel Trilogy will be brought into the game sooner rather than later, the game is excellent because it translates the tense galactic dogfights from the Original Trilogy from the screen to the table. These only slightly detract from the game, though, and I would highly recommend it to any fan of Star Wars, mini gaming, or casual fan.

This is seriously one of the best games ever created. Exciting moments galore. You can have just as much fun playing it casually as you can competitively. I think the designers did an outstanding job. Plus, they actually get design ideas from the current world champion players, on the expansions. That all works to make a super-fun game.

OWNED SINCE 2013
A really exciting game. Even my daughter, who usually does not play board games, likes this one. It is easy to learn and fast to set up. My first couple of games were fun, but they could feel too long towards the end. But, this was because I was playing with my small kids who, at age 7 and below, do not understand the game tactics too well. This made the games very one-sided. Now, after having played this game with another adult, this game is very good. Decisions feel meaningful and games can be very, very close. Also, I now have more ships. I think you need at least 100 pts. worth of ships, for each side, to really have the full experience. I can't wait to get more ships.
     EDIT: I have many of the ships now, and must say they all seem balanced in there own way and none of them have lost their importance because of new expansions- an amazing compliment for any game that there is no power creep, I hope FFG can keep it like this longer. Regardless of what people say and rate each ship I recommend you get what you want because I have found peoples opinions to be very wrong at times. I have enjoyed many ships that others hate. I really look forward to scenarios, and am interested in the big ships if it can make great scenarios. I plan to continue to buy more ships, not that I need them, but I want them and they add a lot to the game's variety. Playing with different builds gives the game new flavors I enjoy.

Rating is based on my current collection (almost all ships through Wave 5).  X-Wing is the most accessible miniature wargame I've come across.  Easy to rope in newcomers and non-gamers due to the beauty of the models and the popular theme.  Gameplay can be explained in just a few minutes, with powers, obstacles, objectives, and rules for large and epic scale ships layered in as needed.  Only downside might be price.

2-players game (yes, 2 players, if you are 3 and desperate to play, ok, do it, but remember that I told you) in which every player controls a bunch of SW ships and engage in a close space combat. The game is fun, I enjoy it, the ships are very nice, the idea of the game, even if not original, it is excellent: to plan in advance the movements and actions and then resolve and check if there are any interactions between ships, between a ship and an asteroid or whatever. That is very fun. But, and it is a huge "but", the issue is that, once you start buying more ships, and trust me, you will, it becomes more and more complex to prepare a game and the set up is a bit of a nightmare. You do not only have to choose which ships will be part of your fleet, you need to decide how many abilities, characters and weapons are going to carry every one of those ships and, every time you buy an extra ship, it comes with a lot of cards that have to be added to the collection.
The real approach of this game, is to think as if you were going to play warhammer 40k (or that type of game, Flames of War, Bolt Action... you understand), I mean, part of the experience is to plan the fleet in advance. Maybe decide with your friend: "400 points", and each one of you get to the table with your army ready, if not, get ready for more than an hour of preparation. Aside from that, the game is very good
Positive:
1. The minis
2. The mechanics
3. Very fun
Negative:
1. The set up is very tedious if the fleets are not prepared in advance

The core game is the same as Wings of War so a fun game, however in true FFG fashion they added all kinds of little nifty things here and there and it comes out quite well I think, you do have more choices to make here but of course its still mostly a tactical affair with a LARGE luck factor. 

So the SW license got a good treatment IMO and the theme does stand out, you do have to hand it to FF as much as they are milking it. (REALLY think 3 ships in the base game is criminal, and then who wants to buy 2 core sets to get more dice, movement markers etc and you end up with duplicate ships? Yuck) 

So a nice thematic game of bluff and second-guessing what your opponent will do (where he will fly). It uses simultaneous programmed actions like Roborally, and everyone playing has mostly all the same move possibilities. You reveal your moves and then move your ship accordingly, do an action if you want to and can, and then if planes are within range firing occurs. You feel the theme at work when you just pass by an opponent and must circle back to try and get him in your sights, only your not sure which way to circle, and things like droids helping you to heal, barrel roll evasions, and more. 

The one thing that seemed a little weird was the strong Pilots with high numbers fighting weak pilots didn’t really have any advantage except attacking first, which is important of course but I would have thought something like a Pilot who attacks a weaker Pilot gets to re-roll one miss each attack (easy houserule if wanted anyway).  Other than that lots of nifty add-ons here to WoW like targeting, shields, stress, etc good stuff. 

Only played with 2 and thought it was quite good that way (where as the core WoW game needs more), playing in teams should also be a fun option I would think too.

I've played this a lot live and online.  Live play is fantastic and beautiful to play. The pre-painted miniatures may be expensive but as someone who takes forever to paint, I'm thrilled at the quality of this product.  Granted, the base set is completely insufficient to sustain your interest for long.  It's a gateway into buying more miniatures and really exploring the possibilities. I would advise focusing on one faction (rebel/empire/scum) and buying a few of those models when you purchase this starter set, otherwise it'll get old quickly.

This game is great. I hesitated for some time before buying it but when I did I was absolutely delighted. The rules are easy to learn, very intuitive and very easy to explain. Even so the game itself is full of decisions and each time you plan your moves you have to consider a lot of factors. 

The miniatures are truly beautiful and just looking at the battlefield, especially if the game is being played on a special gaming mat, is pure pleasure.

Miniature war gaming is at the very core of this gamer.  Unfortunately, cost and availability became that downfall.  Star Wars: X-Wing was a pretty good filler for me.  Very simple to learn, very light, full of theme and some interesting programming mechanics, this makes for a good game.  It is easier to sell than, say, Warhammer 40k gaming sessions with friends.  My only gripes are that an "Epic" battle might consist of 8 figures total, and that it is very, very light.  I'm used to 100  models on a huge table, with charts, tables, books, references, and all that jazz that hardcore gamers would memorize.

System is fun, maneuvering ships around and trying to blast each other in to space debris leads to a good time.

I love this game. Full disclosure, I'm a huge Star Wars OT fan. Then again, fuller disclosure, I'm also a very image-conscious 25-year-old.

That being said, I still somehow am propelled time and again to walk into Barnes & Noble and purchase ship expansions ... usually being rung up by the same guy who judges me every single time. BUT IT'S TOTALLY WORTH IT.

I had never played any other miniature/wargame type game before X-Wing and, at first, I tried to resist the temptation to obsess about my miniatures ... my play area ... my pilot cards ... etc. Then I gave in and I haven't looked back.

This game not only is VERY fun to play (feels well thought out and balanced), but is SOOOO beautiful. I know various people who only collect the miniatures just because they are so well-made. Not only that, but everything is to scale ... which is just awesome. And we're talking about not only ships from the films, but also expanded universe ships. Ever wondered what the Outrider looks like next to the Moldy Crow? Me too. It's stupid cool.

This was also the game that introduced me to FFG who are, by the way, an amazing company. Aside from their quality of product being phenomenal (the widely accepted opinion), they really do care about their customers. I recently misplaced my Tie Interceptor expansion dial and they sent me a replacement free of charge. It's stuff like that that keeps me spending all of my disposable income on their products. 

TLDR: Great game with beautiful components from an awesome company. Fans of Star Wars, it's a no-brainer. Everyone else, worth at least the core set.

Initial rating: 5.0 (October 2012)

In theory, X-wing miniatures would be a great game for me. It has all the ships I always wanted to flight in the Star Wars Universe. In practice the gameplay is awkward and it doesn’t fulfill me. I’m a huge Star Wars fan, but that’s not enough to enjoy X-Wing Miniatures. I also don’t like Wings of War, so this kind of game is not for me. But I DO like this a bit more than Wings of War.

The miniatures are gorgeous (as expected from FFG) and they will be a money pit for the players who buy this game. :devil: Fortunately I’m not in that camp. 

I like that you only plan 1 maneuver and execute, for me, this adds another layer of tactical thinking and IMO reduces the luck I found in WoW. In Wings of War you have to play 3 maneuvers which I always disliked, but this come with a cost, the game is paced more slowly that Wings of War so it can take a longer game to finish. Also it has a lot of luck via the dice rolls. In our game the dice rolls were the determining factor in who won and who lost and if that holds true for all the games the rating will go even down. 

The game can be explained very quickly and plays under 1 hour.

The X-wing miniatures seem a lot smaller then the Tie Fighter ones. I wonder if they are not done at the same scale?

Bottom line if I’m going to play dogfighting, I prefer to play it in a videogame format. X-Wing miniature has great chrome but have little of interest under the hood. I won’t buy it and I don’t plan to play this often if ever.

Current Rating: 5.0

FF at its worst.  Repurpose some of the basic mechanics from Wings of War and throw money at it.  Fiddly to boot.  If playing without terrain, the best tactic seems to be to just fly straight at your opponent.  This game would be nothing without the franchise and the models.  Think about that last sentence for a moment.

Outstanding models and good tactical combat game.  Templates minimize the normal issues that can occur in miniatures games with movement and ranged attacks.  Many options to customize with pilots and weapons.  Already too much variety to keep up with, so I can't comment on the state of the meta game.

Really enjoy playing a plane combat easy to deal, without being too technical. The sad aspect of it is the the editor is submerging the market with lots of add ons that you need to buy to be up to date with your opponent in tournament.

Super Fun Miniatures game and was my first foray into Minis. Getting hold of the whole set is $$$ and does at times feel like you need to make sure you buy all sets or you won't have access to the best fits for the additional points. Truthfully after buying, I found that on TTS it was more fun as the set up was easier, the cleanup was non existent and the Move dials/Movement was automated and made it easier for gameplay... however There's nothing like the feel of these awesome Minis and the look of them in a display case... it's a must for people with nerdy friends and for those that like star wars... Also I wish they were easier to pack up and transport... but I'm assuming that's a gripe with all mini games.

X-Wing is an enjoyable tabletop skirmish game set in everyone's favorite universe. It offers some fun tactical decisions and memorable moments. As with games in this genre, though, the outcome tends to be decided primarily by the dice. I wish the base set came with more than three ships, but there is enough here to scratch the occasional itch.

RATING: 8
One of my favorite Star Wars games. Love the look of the minis on the table. Easy to teach, but great depth over time as you get a grip on pilot and tech combos. Fleet builds are fun to tweak as well. Once again, costs can be prohibitive to some players. Go to your FLGS and have someone demo the game for you, and if it's your bag a core set is pretty good value.

Re-rated as a 10, since the game keeps growing and growing, while avoiding power creep. Impressive game, amazing minis, fun gameplay. With as much invested in it as I have, I have to finally give it a 10. The only problems with it is some setup time if you dont have squads prepared. And ofcourse that one core set is only a taste of what the game has to offer (Even though I recently had a lot of fun introducing new people to the game with just a core set)

RATING: 7
The title hits it spot on. X-Wing, the miniatures games is an action packed recreation of the starfighter battles we came to love as kids. 

The miniatures are reasonably cheap and surprisingly well prepainted for their price. The core rules are easy and fast to comprehend, the execution swift and uncomplicated. The cinematic flair palpable due to the simultanuous planning, movement and the shooting sequences. 

It's the special rules that add (or convolute, depending on your point of view and the amount you like to introduce into your matches) even more spice into it. 

Due to the continued support of FFG there is also an abundance of ships and fighters and even small capital ships (like the Blockade Runner or Rebel transport) available for purchase, with the majority of them centered mostly around the Galactic Civil War.

It provides 3 game modes:
 
1. Dogfight: Where you have squadrons of up to 8 ships for each side battling it out against the other (Which is the default tournament system, btw.)
2. Cinematic: Where you play missions with sometimes unbalanced squadron sizes, but lots of neat mission objectives to fulfill (escort, sabotage, scout, capture the flag)
3. Epic: Where you have tripple or more the standard amount of ships on each side, including the capital ships 
 
Also, there is a very active FFG-supported League and Tournament Scene worldwide operating, so that there is almost always a chance to get into the competetive side of the game. 

I myself have come to see the game to better be played on a casual approach with missions, as a self created campaign or in its Epic incarnation, as the (dogfight) tournament system has become a rather fast paced race between armour and weapons and hence primary the participating player in it just the cashcow for the franchise. 

(This is due to the equipment cards system that provide the games special rules: Some fighters need special equipment cards that aren't included in their own expansion but in another fighter pack [and often in one of the opposing factions} thus forcing the player to buy into the other faction as well if he wants to be able to compete.) 

Once you cut yourself off from the "need to compete", and open yourself up to a more mission centric play, by reenacting duels with your favourite heroes or daring objective themed battles (more or less house ruling the game), it's there where X-Wing really shines. Of course, a quickly thrown down dogfight on the kitchen table doesn't hurt either.

Bonus feels, if you play the Star Wars soundtrack in the background and add a sound-app to the game. 

X-Wing TMG is in fact a Star Wars fans wet dream come true. Though it has to be approached with love and care to really enjoy it to its fullest.

The best Star Wars tabletop game/board game I've ever played. I have lots of expansions and can act out huge battles. It's very satisfying, though also very time-consuming.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Elegantly designed, high quality components, and most importantly great fun!

All of the various expansions are dizzying though. And even if you limit yourself to the very basic types of ships, the various different pilots and ship modification cards can get rather bothersome and too fiddly.

Thankfully though, you can ignore all of that and just use the basic ship stats and abilities! I think those upgrade cards and such are mostly there to prevent the game from getting stale for those who play the same ships repeatedly and don't continuously get more and more expansions.

Edit: Sold off my whole collection. Unfortunately this game has rapidly suffered from "Magic syndrome", where it's become impossible to find anyone willing to play casually. It seems you either need to buy all the latest stuff constantly and play competitively, or not at all...

A big shame, as this was a nice game. But like hell I'm going to put up with this foolishness. I suppose FFG makes big bucks with constant expansions and promotional events, but it really sours me as a player who doesn't want to turn a single game into a life-encompassing obsession.

I like the gameplay and the theme really is there. The lack of 3D in the movement actually feels ok. I'm not a fan of FFG milking their customers for money though.

Extremely fun and addicting miniatures game.  Able to be played in an hour or so (100 point squad, 3' x 3' area).  Lots of fun!  


Edit:  after playing this on and off for the better part of one year, this game still remains very fun.  Tournament scene is shaken up now and again, and keeping things fresh without overproducing enough minis to make it too cumbersome to get involved.

Update after 2 years:
Don't listen to internet whiners and tournament only players (much of boards), get this game and play casually!  Really great strategic movement game, even with turrets in the game.  Epic mode is worth the additional price of minis.  LOTS of fun and greatly balanced tournaments!

My plays of Wings of War were enjoyable, I rate it a '7'. Did my memory betray me and Wings of War isn't as fun as I remembered it? My three plays of Star Wars: X-Wing were ok but nothing to write home about. Only after reading [thread=865799]this review[/thread] I understood what happened.

The thing I enjoy in Wings of War most is the programmed movement part. I enjoy the tactical challenge of outmanoeuvering the other guy. X-Wing replaced the programming part with a single simultaneous selection of movement. Single movements will differ much more than in WoW raising the chaos/surprise factor noticeably.
 
The main improvement of X-Wing is the strategic customization of your fleet. Ships are very different, they can be customized with weapons, pilot skills can be improved etc. In WoW, the different planes are more a different flavour than a different meal, battles are smaller. To be honest, this customization is rather discouraging for me. I don't like to enter the game and already having lost because of a weak setup.

To be fair, I rate it a '6' as I like the basic principle.

Comparisons to Wings of War are both inevitable and fair. Like some others, I was put off by FFG's seeming hijacking of the WoW mechanics, but, in fairness, FFG has improved on them in most every respect *and* attached them to a mass-marketable theme.

Be aware that the pegs on this game have a flat edge unlike Wings of War pegs that are completely round. I tried to twist mine out as they were pulling out hard and I broke them.

However this game is better than Wings. The Point building system, buying optional powers, having optional pilots and the variety of ships really make this one shine. Hoping to get expansions soon.

[Wings of War]
Here was my problem with Wings of War. You could have games which lasted forever, because players made 3 moves in advance and you couldn't react to each other's moves. So both planes could drift really far apart, and it would take a long time to circle round.

[X-Wing]
X-Wing plays very similarly to Wings of War. Fortunately, the long templates and the ability to make one move at a time (reacting to other players) makes this game fast and brutal. The game is easy-to-learn, easy-to-reset and a lot of fun to play.

Played this game with my brother this past weekend and both of us had a blast, even just using the basic ships that come in the core set. It's easy to make this 2-player game a game for even more players by teaming up and assigning individual ships to each player. And once you start adding on the ships from the expansions, your options for play are limitless. By our second game, my brother and I were already dreaming up custom rules scenarios with moving asteroids, etc. Your imagination is the limit in this super easy to learn strategy game, with super fun mechanics which perfectly capture the thematic elements. For added fun, download a Star Wars sound effect app and go crazy with laser blasts and engine howls to make you and your friends feel like you're flying around the depths of space. The Core Set has everything you need to play, but I would recommend picking up two sets, or a copy of the new Force Awakens Core Set, to immediately increase the size of your squads and give each player a set of dice and maneuver templates.

The mechanics flow completely into the theme and make you feel like you`re in the middle of one of a dozen classic star wars battles or ones that could have been. Will not waste space on all the expansion ships I have, but it`s highly recommended. The only caveat is it`s a relatively high price point to get into, though not bad as far as miniature games go. Traded away my collection as it never hit the table anymore, but always down for a game with anyone who was two forces.

I enjoyed the game very much, but I got into one too many games that wouldn't end with two ships flying past each other. I gave this to my brother to make room for Star Trek Attack Wing, which is very similar, but more capital ship instead of dogfighter.

One of simplest and most fun miniatures games I've ever played. The minis are great, the options are great and the ability to play on any tabletop makes it a wonderful game.

This game is simple enough to be taught to family and youngsters, but offers enough variety in squad building and options for "serious" gamers to enjoy.

RATING: 8.5
I am a tad sad at how egregiously it rips off Wings of War...but I cannot deny how much fun we are having with this game.
I am seriously addicted.  The squad building is damn fun.
The "puzzle" into where to move to...how far/fast etc is fun.
The utter destruction of rebel scum is fun.
I cannot say enough how this game has rekindled my love for something I have not paid attention to since 1983.

A miniature skirmish game for people who like the setting or who want to try dipping their tos into the genre and are scared off by the other options. Or for those boardgamers who scoff on including tabletop wargames under the "boardgame" banner but do want to play this?

Good game. Rather expensive (even for the genre) but it somehow gets away with it? Honestly, the setting is very appealing :p

Easily worth a higher score if you're a fan of Star Wars.

RATING: 5.5
I was psyched to play this, love Star Wars, the minis look so darn cool, then you pick your captains and you customize the ships based on a point system... this seemed right up my alley.  we set up our ships and prepared to go to battle but ultimately I felt as if I spent the entire time measuring and turning around and measuring and turning around and measuring and turning around again.

I've heard people say you need a great big playing space, as opposed to the table I played on which was just normal sized.  I've also seen it played with a house rule that allowed ships to basically spin in place as a turn instead of moving.  I could see where these things would improve the experience but I still don't think I'd play again.

It's possible miniature games are just not for me.

INITILAL RATING = 4 (Oct 2012)
I am a star wars fan but Wings of War Deluxe set had 4 minis instead of 3 that this basic set comes with and needs 2 more battle dices. Too many expansions, to much money, same game, different theme. I owned WoW and trade it after a couple of games, i dont think that this one is better...i 'll pass.

LOVE this game, however I HATE that it is a dice rolling fate game. As in, depending on your roll will depend on your success in the war. So someone who has crappy dice rolls but good maneuverability may lose the game because of such inevitable things as the outcome of their dice roll.

Note: Very expensive if you get into it

Very expensive if you really want to get the most out of it but it is a very unique and fun type of game. Lots of pre-game customization will turn off the more casual of gamers but those who are into it can easily assemble a fighter squadron for friends to play with. Lindsay always beats me though so maybe I should have taken off a few points.

I've only played a few games so far, but I do enjoy the game like I do D&D Attack Wing. The games are a little longer and there is only one elevation.

[size=12][b]Why I like Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game[/b][/size]
+ The game is easy to teach
+ The mechanics work alright. 
+ There is high player involvement
+ There is decent replayability
= The game requires meaningful decisions to win the game in terms of how you move the ship and use your special abilities to mitigate bad dice rolls. 
+ The Star Wars theme works well. 
+ The game is short enough.

[size=12][b]Fixable dislikes in regards to Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game[/b][/size] 
/ I wish the map was more threatening with say moving asteroids. there seem to be variants in the forums that address this problem.
/ The game seems to lack a cooperative 2 v 2 or 3 v 3 mode. I did some research and there seem to be variants that address this complaint. If there are not then you could probably just divide the ships among the players. 

[size=12][b]Why I dislike Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game[/b][/size]
- I was not a fan of some of the ships. I think that the designer could have halved the number of ships and improved the viability of the ships.

The 'only plan 1 move at a time' change makes it feel very different from Wings of War - much lighter and simpler.

The WWII wings of war 'conveyor belt' move planning seems more interesting but this stripped down system is maybe better for the Star Wars version.

The figures and other bits are great - though expensive - and as a male born in the 70s it's very, very hard to resist getting everything!

Fun, quick, thematic. Captures the speed and "thrill" of SW Universe space combat; a little more interesting than the similar Wings of War/Glory system that has obviously influenced X-Wing.

People may argue the plus and minuses of the price - I'm in the "it's a little overpriced" camp. Will be passing on this one unless my son asks for it or buys it. Can't justifying shelling out $35 for the base set and another $12 per expansion when I can have 20+ starfighters in the "air" in "Star Warriors" from WEG, purchased all in for $30.

Light, tactical war game. Outguessing the opponent's move is important, but the luck of dice is much more critical. The base set is okay in itself for two players. If you combine multiple sets, you can simulate a massive, epic space battle. Fun to fiddle with those miniatures.

Got this while on vacation with my nephews to give us something to do in the evenings. Just got a single main box set initially, with an extra A-Wing, and Tie Interceptor. It was a big enough hit to go back and get another X-Wing, a Y-Wing, and Advanced Tie. 

The cool thing is the variations in the ship/character cards, and the different things those pilots can do. It was a big hit with the nephews who really aren't that interested in the other table-top games I own. A lot of that probably has to do with the fun of having a known character on the board in one of the ships, like Darth Vader himself.

I haven't tried out any other ships than what we first got, but I'll probably pick some up some used ones on Ebay some day. 

Its a pretty impressive game.

I had fun and would play again, but I think I'd prefer Heroscape. The ships can get a little chaotic when theres congestion and it becomes a game of guessing what everyones going to do, which isn't the type of tactical play I'd want out of a miniatures game.

I really love the simultaneous secret movement mechanic. (Wings of War, which is similar/inspired this, is also cool. But I like that you only choose one movement in SW, instead of three, which makes for a less chaotic game).

The minis and theming are great.

As a 501st member, I was heavily into this when it first came out...  But after playing it too many times, and running into some "endless loop" dogfighting (where I used the strategy of crashing into an asteroid on purpose to make the game end sooner), I kinda lost interest...

Love the ships, and the characters, but some of the gameplay just got repetitious...

RATING: 5
This game is not necessarily bad if you like analog miniatures games. Unfortunately, I prefer playing with miniatures in a digital space. Besides being very unlucky in the game I played I don't thinks at first glance that the game is broken or unbalanced.

I was a great fan of the "tie fighter" video game and I know a lot about star wars dog fighting. It reproduced slightly the same feeling because you have to judge the amount of movement you need to catch your opponent. So you are never sure how you are going to end up after movement.

The first problem I have with this game is that it is a star fighter only game. And if you do that, then you have failed to learn the whole strategy behind star wars navy. Capital ships are essential, and just having star fighters is plain boring.

The second problem is that it's an EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE game. You pay almost 15$ for 1 miniature. Come on, even in hero scape, you ended-up with 2 squads of 3 units for that price. So if you want to seriously play this game, you need to be a rich guy that does not know what to do with his money since you are going to spend many hundreds of dollars.

So I don't think it's a bad game, if you actually like analog miniature games.

Uh oh, another money-pit coming from Fantasy Flight.  The miniatures are nicely painted and the game is pretty tight.  Each side gets the same amount of points to spend for ships/pilots/mods.  Wings of War style of fighting to some degree in that each person selects a maneuver at the same time but only one move in advance.  Lowest ranked pilot flies first while the highest ranked pilot fires first - very important to keep those factors in mind as you maneuver.

When I have more than the base set expect this value to go up.

Edit: it has gone up, but I think the above still applies. I really like this game!!

Edit: lets face it, this game is a 10 for me. I'll always play this game, and I'm always thinking about that next ship I'll get. I don't have the budget to go willy nilly but slowly adding ships as you can find them for cheap is kinda like a fun minigame. :D

I really regret not getting into this game sooner than I did. I jumped in around Wave 6, and now I wish I got on-board when Wave 1 released! One of the best games I've ever played. I'd explain this game as an LCG meets Miniatures Game, and it turned out perfectly. The replayability is even better than most LCG's. The figures come assembled and pre-painted. It's just a beautiful game, very thematic, and a lot of fun.

Although this isn't typically my type of game it does present interesting strategies and tactics and was one I thoroughly enjoyed playing. That being said, in my opinion the best way to experience the game is competitively which can be brutal as you need to keep up with the release schedule and dedicate the time to play was is essentially a lifestyle game.

I was very suprised with this game, it is very fast. I was worried about the bigger battles taking too long.

Played this at 2 players.

Really enjoy this game. You feel like you are maneuvering a ship. It's tactical and strategic. 

With some luck to keep things on the edge. Very thematic!

Played it with team play of 2 against 2. I enjoy the team play more because I actually can focus on the special abilities of the ships and take advantage of them.

When controlling all ships alone it's a lot more to remember.

Ok granted this is probably my first actual miniatures game so perhaps I'm just not a fan of the genre rather than this game in particular. The way movement works with a sharp or steep curve to the left/right and different ships being able to maneuver differently is cool, along with the way the game resolves turn order so that you can use all your ships instead of just a couple each turn, but having to constantly measure if I can hit this ship or not and the inaccuracies of moving your ships around really bothers me and I wish I had my grid movement back. I've noticed as with a lot of Fantasy Flight games I really like some of the concepts but don't like how they play out.

RATING: 7.8
simple and fun game with mechanism borrowed from wings of glory.  You are allowed to customize your squards and the miniatures are v. detailed.  The only down size is that you need to buy ALOT more miniature for a fun game.  Another FFG money draining pit!!

1/10/18:

I have stopped "collecting" this game.   unfortunately the last couple waves have just come too fast, with too much, and really stretching the design space for this game in a way I don't like.    

I still love x-wing, but the new stuff is just alittle too much for me.

Such a good game.  I really enjoy out, I just have 3 complaints... 
1) they've done very well re-balancing some things, but there's still some work to be done
2) their huge ships need a bit of a rework, and as above, a little more balancing
3) while they do nerf broken things... currently the Uboat build by itself isn't broken, but it hard counters too many other builds... it needs a TIE phantom level correction ASAP

It looks amazing.  Let's get that out of the way.  It's not terribly good out of the box.  Let's get that out of the way too.  X-Wing captures the spirit of dogfighting almost as if it was Wings of War.  The defense dice ruin that combat, though.  The ship balance isn't great, but objectives kinda fix that.  Keeping up with the new waves of minis fix some of these problems, but then you're collecting minis and do you really want to be that person?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
This is hands down my favourite game. No doubt about it. I like Star Wars and some of the more iconic characters, but I'm not a fanatic. The gameplay itself is what keeps me engaged.

PROS:
-Easy to learn, hard to master.
-Simultaneous planning of maneuvers in activation phase.
-Maneuver templates for movement instead of hexes or squares. Love this!
-Very balanced considering all that's out for the game. And the designers are always working to keep every ship relevant.
-It's a dice game, but skill will win over luck.
-Production value. The miniatures are amazing.
-Replayability beyond dogfighting (which I'm still not tired of) with many official missions and not to mention fan-made ones like The Heroes of Aturi Cluster (http://dockingbay416.com/campaign/)

CONS:
-Pricey if you are a completionist.
-If you're getting into the game now, all the upgrades and pilots might be overwhelming.
-It IS a dice game and sometimes you set up that perfect shot and... roll all blanks!

Re-rated from a 9.75 to 9. The bloat due to the business model is ruining the game and power creep is real.

The game plays like advanced checkers, Tic-tac-toe 2.0.  It is bad. Fanboy extravaganza, this game has a rating that is far away from reality.  The game is an OK game but it is tedious by comparison to other more well designed dog fight mini games. I really wanted this game to be good but what I ultimately found it to be was a typical Star Wars licensed product, all surface glitz with nothing else to offer.

This game has everything I want in a miniatures game: Fast game play, tons of replayability, prepainted minis (which just look stellar!), unit customization, tense combat, oozing with theme, and appeals to both gamers and non-gamers of all ages (my eight year old loves it).  If you are looking for a definitive Star Wars spaceship combat system, then look no further.  And if you really want the full experience, make sure you play the Star Wars film score in the background.  My only complaint is that the smaller miniatures, especially the tie fighters and x-wings, are fragile.  Regardless, this game is worth every penny and then some.

On paper, I should like this game a lot more than I actually do.  It's good great looking miniatures, and it captures very well the experience of a dogfight, especially videogame dogfights like the ones in Red Baron, Freespace, or X-Wing.  Instead, there are four things that detract from my enjoyment:  1) I have played dogfight videogames before, I have already mined this vein and I no longer enjoy as much circling around each other waiting to get the broadshot, or the opportunity to tail the enemy, or whatever slight advantage one needs to win the dogfight.  2)  Without a grid on the plying surface, I have a hard time visualizing where my fighter and the opponent's fighter will next be.  I understand that this probably gets better with knowledge and practice, but it's like playing blind. 3) I usually dislike resolving combat though dice rolling.  I disliked it in Risk, and I dislike it in the Battle Cry type games, and this is no exception.  There is something unsatisfying and grating about tactics being irrelevant due to a bad roll of dice.  4)  Time investment.  Clearly this is a game that would require significant time investment and repeated plays to become reasonably good at it (for example to learn to better visualize movement).  5)  Cost -- exorbitant.  This last factor plays a stronger role because I usually am reluctant to like games that I cannot afford, probably a mixture of jealousy and self preservation.  So in spite of the excellent components, the good theme integration, the good mechanics, the bluffing and deduction element, the spatial element, the skill component, the customizability -- all elements that I usually like very much in a game -- I would only play this occasionally as a short dogfight, and will not ask for it unless I am in the mood for this type of experience and ready to win or lose playing blind and with my fate in a roll of dice.

Not being mad on miniature style war / battle games was semi reluctant to play this but the star wars theme made me try it - BOY was i wrong - This game is fantastic . play as either Empire or Rebels and allocate each side points - then spend those points on ships and pilots and upgrades - Rules are easy to learn and the game moves very quick - combat is dice based - very enjoyable but the only downside is to build up big selection of ships is quite expensive - I took a friends advise and brought 2 core sets which id advise any other new player to do - Ive added a fair few ships but 1 additional ship (xwing tie-advance) is about 10£ though they do come with extra pilot and upgrade cards.

This was very fun during the first 6 waves or so.  Now I have lost interest with both the game and keeping up with the many waves of minis.

Plus, the signature ship of the game, the X-Wing, always feels inferior.  As it is the titular craft and probably one of the most iconic of Star Wars ships (next to the Millennium Falcon, the TIE Fighter, and the Imperial Star Destroyer), that is a turn-off.

Wing of Star Wars is as good as the parent games in every way and has the added coolness of old school Star Wars. 

I like the pilot Actions better, and the templates/dial are way easier than the card decks from WoW.

It is pricey, but so are all mini's based games. 

Really best as a 2 player, but larger numbers work ok. 

If I had to sum it up I think x-wing takes a great flight sim engine from wing of war and adds a game on top of that.  Streamlining the movement to be perhaps less realistic (these are space ships) but simpler, and adding in the decisions of the pilot actions to add a lot of fun to the game. 

The deck building aspect of this also adds to the game.

LOVE IT!
Great 2 player game (maybe more, why not) with tension, fun and great replayability! 
It surely needs feeding (only 3 ships in the core set), but when you enjoy it so much it's worth it!
Only negative aspect is that it takes a while to set up, so not very appropriate for "a quick match".

Star Wars.  

Amazing mini sculpts.

Agonizing tactical decisions.

Oh man!

This is so different than any other game I own or have played.  It's refreshing to have it fill a niche that no other game does!  The high quality components and elegant rules are outstanding, and the Star Wars theme seals the deal!

Occasionally measuring movements gets annoying...and sometimes we accidentally knock the ships a bit out of position, which is no good!  Still, the movement mechanic is like no other game I have, so overall I'm still a fan.

I never expected to get into a minis game, but the Star Wars theme and a relatively low buy-in level helped. While I usually lose this game, the list-planning aspects and the tactical movement are incredibly rewarding by themselves. This game is also introducing me to a world of gamers outside of my usual group, which is pretty darn cool.

My favourite tabletop combat game, ever. The Star Wars theme drew me to it in the first place, having played Wings of War in the past with my gaming buddies. An elegantly crafted rules system. Quality components. Amazing, detailed miniatures. So many options and variants to choose from. Tactical and balanced. All of my gaming group own copies of the base game and all of the expansions. This has to be our go-to game of choice. When Fantasy Flight Games announce each successive expansion due to be released I just sigh and reach for my wallet...

RATING: 7
Initially sceptical of this being a straight 'Wings of War' clone, but it improves on that basic template to create a fast, tactical game of reading your enemy, positioning and good old luck. Fleet building is simple and the game can be easily scaled for new players.

(Edit) I'm actually starting to miss Wings of War's focus on manoeuvring and semi-deterministic damage, as it can be very frustrating and anti-climactic to out-fly someone in X-Wing, only to roll crap dice. Also too many turrets these days. Not sure how I feel about this one at present.

(Further Edit) I sold up. Couldn't justify so much money tied up in ships for a 2-player game I was falling out of love with. Had a fun few years, won some local tourneys, so no hard feelings. Bought SO MUCH STUFF from the proceeds of sale!

I've kinda soured on this recently. While there is a flood of new ships, I don't really feel like this game changes very much. It's not at all balanced so there is always the OP army you can build which unless against another of the OP armies, will dominate. I want to be able to use some of the ships I bought but they just aren't fun when they are almost guaranteed to lose. I think I'll be trading this away or selling it.

This game really is fantastic.  The theme is clearly awesome if one loves Star Wars, the gameplay is supurb, and the components are an incredible value for their detail and quality.
The reason I don't give it a 10 is because setup, if you don't already know what you want to field (and even then),can be and often is very long.  Cleanup is a chore as well.  Storage solution is a must for this game, if you go beyond a core set or two.
Gameplay is brisk, exciting, and is fun for people to simply watch.  This to me really helps, as those not in the game can spectate, yet not get bored as in standard board games.

Love it. Piloting your ships is intensely satisfying. The only improvement I might make would be that the missions are often a little dull if you don't want to play a straight dog fight.

This captures the feel of a tense dogfight superbly, the miniatures are exceptional and the rules are easy to grasp while still offering many strategic options.

This is the only miniature game I am ever interested in. And I bought everything, every glorious mini. And the rules shine with the same luster as the minis do.

2x

2 plays with core and Wave 1 (-Y-Wing). Had a nice time, a playmat is necessary and the dice put in a huge luck factor: that's something I have to get used to in this type of game.

I love the minis and the feel of the game. Especially when my opponent starts quoting Star Wars... :)

Edit: one minor drawback. Setting up and packing the game takes some time.

Edit2: I have grown in the game. I don't like making up squads ('deckbuilding'), but I just borrow squads from other players and adjust them a bit to my playstyle. I do like to try out different ships and I shouldn't take more than 3 ships, otherwise it's not fun for me. I really like the missions provided with the core set and the big ships.

Since I'm a fan of Star Wars I had high expectations on this game, but I was dissapointed. Although the minis are very well produced the game is not as exciting as it should be, I dislike the templates system for movement and how expensive the game is if you want to have just a decent fleet to 'play' (X-wing actually seems to me more as a collection product than a good game).

streamlined version of Wings of War. Buying it because the theme will attract more players than WOW.

Update- as a long time fan of both Star Wars and wings of war this seemed perfect. I've introduced the game to many gaming groups and the result is never encouraging. The game just doesn't end dramatically! 

I was very excited about the changes to the core system but after replaying wings of we I prefer it's I less system. I don't know what to do with this game now, thematically this game is more appealing then wings of war but WOW seems to be more satisfying!

Maybe the new ships will come with new scenarios that will spice up the game...

Update: I've bought all the ships and still haven't been impressed by the scenarios or how the actions work. This game will end up on ebay or donated to my office soon.

Update: this game has been completely replaced by GF9:s Tanks game. Real tabletop gaming (with terrain), no hard to understand actions, terminology, or custom dice... Just fast and fun epic battles.

Awesome use of the Flight Path system. FFG has been doing a great job with game balance, the models look great, and the game is overall reasonably priced. The way they package the upgrade cards is very business-oriented: in order to fly a completely legal (non-proxy) list you'll need to purchase lots of ships, sometimes multiples. 

This grows to be a very expensive game, saved only by comparison to other miniatures as reasonable.

Wings of War is a great system, we loved it, but got phased out eventually, as it way too often came down to circling around each other endlessly. With getting rid of the limitations of historical and physical accuracy, the game became more intense and dynamic, while remained realistic in its own universe. 

I don't care much for SW, but loved to play SW: Tie Fighter back in the days, and the fighters have kept their distinguished characteristics amazingly well. The customizable fighters and pilots, paired with the easy and intuitive control adds a lot to the WoW system, and the result is a fantastic tactical game, which easily can handle ten or so fighters simultaneously.

As a Star Wars fanatic, and a lover of games where you pilot an air/space craft, I LOVE X-Wing! Over the past 4-5 years, this game has received a TON of expansions featuring ships and characters from the Star Wars universe, and some that are really obscure knowledge from Legends. The only thing I don't like about this game (which says a lot, actually) is that the competitive scene is too meta-driven, and sometimes you just want to play for fun instead. Aside from that, X-Wing has everything you're looking for in a great Star-Wars themed game!

[COLOR=#FF3300]A very deep and satisfying flight path system game. I'd say for the moment, it's better than D&D:AW, but I am swayed towards it because a) HobbyShop sells the models and it's cheaper/faster to acquire it not just in LTU, but online as well (compared to D&D), thus giving a lot of different squads to try out and b) there's competitive play for it in LTU.

There's also a lot of room for one to improve in piloting not just the ship, but predicting the movement of other ships (which is awesome)

I'm not really into miniatures games or two-player games, so this one is already a tough sell for me.  But despite that, I like having it in my collection and have enjoyed my few plays of it.  I've primarily played this in the easier intro mode with my kids but have ventured into some of the more advanced rules a few times.  As a quick skirmish game I enjoy it and have been very pleased with the ship models.  Fairly high cost to build out a collection so I'll likely keep expansions to a minimum, but even with the core set and a few extra ships it's fun to play.

I liked this, the templated movement and relatively easy rules makes this quick to get up and running even with new players (just tone down on the upgrade cards and triggered abilities, getting the hang of moving around is enough for most beginners).

Playing is tense even if it's a dice fest - I still feel I lost because I played badly for the majority of games. Positioning is key, rolling badly just hammers home the point.

Not looking to ever be competitive in this, but there is quite a bit of depth even with a smaller selection of models so you won't tire of it quickly - and you can always proxy the cards.

Hard to explain my feelings on this one.  "Yea!  I love StarWars" and "Boooo!  I hate having to buy into expansions to get ships".  The mechanic is cool.  Easier to understand than I thought it would be.  I feel the need to invest in a felt space board to enhance play.  And that's my issue.  As much as I love it, I hate the feeling of wanting to invest more in it.  

At this point I can say that I have invested way too much in this game.  I have not added the expansions to my list out of shear embarrassment. But it is a fun game and I haven't stopped buying crap :-)

Update: Still love this game.  Seems the more shit I buy the more I still like it.  Wish there was better storage options.  Really looking forward to the day when they come out with something that makes me walk away

My favorite board game of all time.  The strategy that goes in to list building, asteroid placement, ship placement and maneuvering is fantastic.  FFG keeps this game very well balanced and interesting by regularly releasing new ships and cards that shape the current meta game.  Fun both as a competitive game and also by just sharing ships with a friend that wants to play.  I also have to say that this is a game that is really enjoyable to play even when you lose.  And each game you learn to play a bit better.

An interpretation of Wings of Glory, but somehow the (practially) reskinned mechanics don't work here.

Nice to have a Star Wars game that feels well-designed AND actually similar to the source material at the same time.

This game is a tough one for me.

I *love* Star Wars, and the notion of this tactical dogfighting game with the famous ships I loved and more coming out every few months was FAR too tempting to pass up.  My friend Brian got me into this, and he had most of the Rebel AND Imperial ships.  Not wanting to copy what he already had available for play, I ended up buying all of the newly available Scum & Villainy ships in one fell swoop, before we played the game maybe 3 times.  It then sat for over a year, for lack of people to play with, and also due to not having time.  Brian is imminently going to move to Utah for at least 8 months of each year, and he actually sold his holdings of this game in favor of Star Wars Armada.

It is also worth mentioning I didn't really enjoy the dogfighting as it actually played out, as many times this just led to a handful of ships juking successfully turn after turn.  Exciting to start, boring as hell to finish any given playthrough.

Shucks.

I ended up deciding to sell my holdings in this game to my friend Jason who is getting into it, and we have actually settled into playing through the player-made coop campaign every few weeks, and I love that.  MUCH More fun that the interminable dogfighting to me; and I don't own it any more so there is no more temptation to dump money into it.

The perfect game. This game has it all, really simple rules, but infinite playability. It's hard to think of a miniatures game that you can play with anyone, but this is it. Can you think of a miniatures game that you can introduce to an entry level gamer that you can also feel confident will be on your shelf forever? I sure can't. Love this game and absolutely the only thing bad I have to say about it is there is no reason in the world there isn't a factory issued play mat. But who cares? Plenty of star field play mats out there, and if you don't like those, have a banner printed, which is what I did. Look at a picture of this game in play, if you like how that looks at all, get it. Don't be a wimp and buy just one core set though. Get two and play it.

I have only played a couple of games of this so far and as I have a large-ish and growing collection Wings of Glory: WW1 Airplane Packs, Wings of Glory: WW2 Airplane Pack and aircraft for Axis & Allies Air Force Miniatures: Angels 20 the last thing I need is another aerial combat game. This is that game!

This game has a great theme, I was a little kid when the Star Wars movies came out and have always been fond of the Star Wars universe. This game offers the chance to play out space battle in that universe with wonderful miniature X-wings, Y-wings as well as a variety of TIE fighters and suchlike.

The game itself is pretty easy to learn. Anyone who has played Wings of Glory: WW1 Duel Pack would find a lot of the concepts to be pretty familiar. Each vessel is assigned an action (the breadth of actions available is determined by the capabilities of each ship) in secret each turn and in reverse pilot skill order executes that action and then may take another action depending on ship capabilities and/or pilot attributes. Once all actions have been executed those ships able to shoot then shoot at any eligible targets through rolling the specialist dice. These shots may be avoided again by rolling specialist dice dependent on the manoeuvrability of each vessel and pilot abilities.

The game itself plays well and is fast and fun. The individual pilot skills and ship upgrades can be altered each game (there is a points system to construct your forces) which gives a fair bit of variety and replayability to this game. Note that there is no consideration given to altitude so it is very much a two dimensional battle but that’s okay as it makes it much simpler without detracting very much at all from the experience. The miniatures themselves are superb and really look the part. They are comparatively fragile so be careful around small children but, gee, as I say, they look great.

This game looks to be well supported and has a pretty big following as far as I can gather. I can see myself getting into this one, no doubt to the annoyance of Mrs Fish. Still, when the Little Fish are a bit older I am sure they’ll love playing this with their old man. So, it’s an investment in a happy family future, isn’t it?

Star Wars: X-Wing ist zwar ein Miniaturen Spiel, jedoch mit relativ bersichtlichen Regeln und einem leichten Einstieg. Mit dem Basis-Set kann man sich einen guten Überblick, über das Spiel und seine Mechaniken schaffen. Im Grunde geht es um Weltraumschlachten im Star Wars Universum, jedoch von der Größe eher an kleinere "Dog Fights" erinnernd. Mit einem Papp-Rad stellt man zu Beginn eines Zuges die Flugroute seiner Schiffe ein, dadurch entsteht ein Überraschungsmoment und es gilt, vorauszuplanen und den Gegner zu durchschauen. Ausrüstungsgegenstände, Piloten und Bewaffnung sorgen für unglaublich viel Abwechslung. Die Miniaturen sind vorbemalt und machen einen sehr hochwertigen Eindruck, wie auch der Rest des Spielmaterials. Aber X-Wing ist mit seinen unzähligen Erweiterungen auch ein Geld- und Ressourcenfresser (Platz!), auf den man sich einlassen muss.

As a big fan of Star Wars, and especially starships, I love this game, A LOT.  I don't play as often as I would like, because of all the "build your squad" part is quite complex for the new players I introduce to the game.

[i]X-Wing[/i] is a very good Ariel space battle miniatures game! The overall game play is tight and simple to learn, the movement system is near perfect (pending those all too convenient 'whoops! knocked it, now I'm in range' moments..), the combat is random and often dynamic and it just looks incredible!

Unfortunately the more time that goes by the more fed up I get of it!

The Star Wars theme just doesn't excite me that much despite the amazing looking minis! This has been offset somewhat by the release of the Scum faction which has brought several interesting looking expanded universe ships into play, but there's several themes that are similar I would have rather played.

I've also always felt that X-Wing is very prone to 'gaming'. If you are just playing casually- throwing together something random and having fun with it, its a real blast, but try to play against someone competitively and the horrible meta-game comes into play, looking for every loop hole, strength and rule that can be exploited to the fullest. The internet is awash with people ranting about the current meta and its most recent game breaking builds and strategies. Its exhausting, and it saps the fun for people like me who just want to have fun with it.

The worst turn off though is the never ending expansions. [i]This game is never going to stop.[/i] Fantasy Flight Games will keep putting out wave after wave of new ships for all eternity, and I don't want to go any further with it. Owning just one ship from each wave must have reached £1000 at retail now, or damn near close. I've played the game 30 odd times, nowhere near enough to justify that kind of money. 'Just don't buy the new stuff then', I hear you say. Well that brings me back to complaint number 2- the meta-game demands I do, otherwise I will not be able to keep up with the newest combos, upgrades and fixes to my older ships that's making everyone else stronger. I feel I have two choices left- either abandon the game and only play it with casual gamers or stop buying stuff and play with just what I already have- leading to me losing every game I play against the still active users who are forever gaining newer and stronger stuff.

This has understandably soured my attitude to the game. Shame, because at its core its not too bad.

Progressive Rating: 8-9-8-7-6.

Really enjoy X-Wing Miniatures. Things to note are the ways you can upgrade your setup and resources to play with. There are squadron builder tools online, dice apps on the phone, and plenty of expansions to upgrade your squadrons with, at price points that won't destroy you. Dog fighting with heroes is the most fun I've had in a free flowing miniatures game.

This fills my desired slot for a "Wings of War" type miniatures game in my collection.  I like the theme and the components are fantastic.  We've started expanding play with additional obstacles on the play field.  I think obstacles and missions are critical to replayability.  Beyond that, Wave 2 will expand the fleet building options.

My one observation is that games seem to overstay their welcome a bit.

No me llama la atención el universo star wars. Y a pesar de ello me he hecho con la caja básica.

No es necesario coleccionar expansiones a no ser que

1. Seas un freaky del universo star wars

2. Que quieras hacer grandes combates espaciales. 

No obstante es un buen juego sencillo en la cual te puedes echar unos buenos ratos, la mecánica se basa en la intuición a la hora de maniobrar con la nave y la suerte con los dados a la hora de querer impactar.

Me gusta, lo recomiendo.

RATING: 5.9
Based on one extended game session where my pilot did pretty well (2 kills and lived to fight again) I'm not as impressed with this game as I expected to be.

I enjoy Wing of War/Glory as a light war themed game with aircraft shaped counters (it's no war game or flight-sim) and was expecting to find X-Wing somewhat similar but set in the Star Wars Universe, I was disappointed.

To me X-Wing is a puzzle first and a game second, even without using all the pilot and ship extra abilities (cards). For something that's meant to be recreating the lightning-fast action of a cinematic space dogfight there's far too much opportunity for analysis (paralysis) that drags out play time and prevents it from having anything like a 'realistic' feel. The 'hard wired' initiative system only compounds the problem.

There are some very nice ideas (EG the stress system and red/green manoeuvres) but I'll stick to the occasional game of WOW/G and leave X-Wing to the die-hard Star Wars fans and puzzle geeks.

Picked up two extra ships along with the base game.  Rebels had two ships and Empire had three ships.  I specifically got Darth Vader's ship so it could be Luke vs. Vader!  It was a lot of fun.  Pretty simple game rules wise, but getting good at dog fighting takes some skills.  I'm excited to play an actual mission!  Now if only I had the cash for the Millennium Falcon and Slave 1. *drool*

Of any war game or dog-fighting simulation, this is the one I will play. It has a ton of great design ideas and fluid game-play. Much less fiddly in comparison to other similar war games I've played. The simultaneous movement selection and having to "eyeball" the distance a ship could move is brilliant and fun. As a plus, being a Star Wars fan, the figures are really nice - almost decorative.

It's worthwhile to add that I think playing this in the competitive zone would kill my enjoyment of the game. Playing with new ships and combinations in such a casual way keeps this game fun and fresh and valuable for me.

What's not to like? The miniatures are nice even if you don't play the game, but the game itself is a nice simple combat system with enough luck to keep everyone on their toes but always with the likelihood that clever tactics will win out. The variety of ships and pilots and upgrades means that working out how to put a force together so that it all clicks is an interesting puzzle in itself.

A great quick-playing dogfigher game with outstanding miniatures at an affordable price. Little to no prep to play but nearly infinite options to expand the game if you choose to. There's not much with the basic game (with 3 fighters), but expanding with the expansion pack allows you to fill out your fleet how you want to.

One of my two favorite table-top games at the moment, and I've already customized my minis to a degree so I can identify them easily when playing with others.

Almost limitless potential for scenarios and customization. The engine is remarkably smooth and uncomplicated.

This game is FUN!  Flying around, dodging asteroids, attempting to outwit and out gun your opponent in the Star Wars universe ... nothing else need be said.

Well except maybe that this is a miniatures game.  What I mean is that you will practically certainly buy more ships to add to the base game after you've played it even once (that is to say increased cost).  You really needn't own every ship, but having a few really enhances the game.  And they all come pre-painted, that's great!

RATING: 9
Really great game.  I'm not a huge Star Wars fan and you don't have to be to enjoy this game.  If you are a fan why haven't you bought this already (don't think, do)?  Great models, good movement system, and expands nicely.

This is not a miniatures game!!!!  If you buy it with this expectation you will be disappointed.  It's a board game that has cool elements of miniature gaming in it, like to scale miniatures, points system, ship customisation, etc.

You will need to buy some expansions as the base game only has two different types of ships and things get stale after a while.  However you don't have to buy loads of expansions either.  I would recommend spending some time deciding which expansions are best for you.

The only issue I have is that it does not scale well to really large games.  You can have huge battles but expect them to take a long time, easily over 5 hours.  Having said that it was designed for smaller ship to ship games and not fielding every model you own (shame, I own lots).

After my first two plays, we have yet to see Imperials stand up to the Rebel force. This is contradictory to most of the comments I have seen which have stated the exact opposite. I suspect that this 'imbalance' is more due to us playing wrong than anything else. However, despite the lopsided games, everybody involved in these games have greatly enjoyed themselves despite the outcome. I'm optimistic that this game will only improve after more plays.

Update: My suspicion was correct. We were not playing Imperials properly by not using their evasion and barrel rolls enough. Both sides feel very balanced and each game is close. I absolutely love this game win or lose, and to me that is a sign of a great game.

Finally, something to replace Decipher's Star Wars Customizable Card Game as my favorite Star Wars game! Yeah, its only squadron-level dog-fighting, but it feels right. The size difference between the little snub fighters and the capital ships is immense, so a scale integration of the two is not really possible.

Despite the massive amount of components in the Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game - Core Set, the game play is far more intuitive than one would expect. Teaching the game is a very simple affair. Owning the game though is a costly endeavor, as no one is likely to look at the ships included in the Core Set and think, 'Yep, I'm done'. For anyone interested in adding more TIE Fighters and X-Wings to their collection, the Core Set offers the best bang for the buck.

As someone who doesn't have the time or inclination to paint miniatures, the pre-painted ships were a great draw. The models, and their support pillars, are really quite delicate though, so extra care must be taken during play and storage.

RATING: 8
What a great miniatures game.  If it did not have such a high upfront cost to get all of the cool ships that you would want, it would be owned.

I really thought it was cool that you can change the pilot that you are using, adjust the abilities that the ship will have in each setting so that the Millenium Falcon can be either a tough tank, or an offensive powerhouse.

The little cardboard pieces you use to move your vehicles is quite lame, but I don't see how else you could do it.  Sometimes you misjudge, and the rules for when you do are kind of irritating, but I am sure after a few more plays that would be not as big of a problem.

I never played with SW action figures when I was a kid.  Never got the point, really.  But THIS?  This makes me feel like a 7-year-old again.  Pew, pew!

For the second time at this Gencon, FFG takes an old property (in this case, Wings of War) and gives it a glossy new coat of sci-fi paint.  I'm not too proud to say that as much as I enjoyed Wings of War, this miniatures game is sooooo much better.  Be warned: The 20-minute gameplay is highly addictive, the short rules allow you to play within minutes, and everyone at the table will be talking about Red Leader and speaking into intercoms.

This game could very easily reinvigorate the miniatures market even more than Warhammer 40k and Hordes.  It's a game-changer.

A few things I don't care for in the game: 1. The imprecision of the movement with overlapping pieces. 2. How hopeless your plight can become if you lose your "star" ship early and have to slog through an hour of attrition. 3. The set up time is longer than the game itself due to fleet selection 4. Hard to be balanced when playing with someone else's set or two different sets. I do like its relative simplicity, flexibility, replayability, and beautiful miniatures. I don't think I'd ever turn down a game, but I'm not going to seek it out.

Extremely fun spatial dogfighting game with simultaneous movement/psychology. The theme is great too, although I wish Han Solo could swoop in at the last moment.

Immersive game play, depth of strategy and the high production value make this one of my favorites. I am very impressed by the depth of game play given the relative simplicity of the rules. 

There are some issues with the game, but I am a sucker for customize-ability (squad building) and expand-ability, which make many of the issues (such as balance) inevitable.  I think X-wing balances these issues well.  Also, the limited ship pool makes it possible for me to keep up the game with my limited free time (unlike CCGs or LCGs, which just build up variety too quickly for me to keep up).

RATING: 7
A little on the simple-side, best for two players and very expensive to get a decent number of ships.  I cant see any reason why this is rated so highly, except that it is Star Wars.  Had this game been any other franchise than Star Wars you would not see ratings nearly so high.

Um... wow. I haven't been as instantly hooked on a gaming experience since I first played Magic in middle school.

I don't like the expandable/customizable model, and the core set comes with half as many ships as it should. But the mechanics are rock-solid. Scenarios with turn limits or alternate objectives should be implemented to prevent endgame lag.

Absolutely fantastic competitive miniatures skirmish game! Just the right balance of blind luck, calculated risk, tactical acumen, and strategic thinking are required to play this game well. As an added bonus, it also happens to not only be the easiest miniatures game to learn and play that I have ever seen, but the models all come pre-painted (and are rather well-done too!) and are cheaper than you would expect!

If you have not played this game before and you have even a passing interest in miniatures games, you really owe it to yourself to give it a try. You might be surprised at how much you like it!

I was tempted to pass on this, given the countless hours I've spent painting Battlefleet Gothic and not yet playing a single game of it. But I was turned around by the fast pace of the smaller scale. As well as the fact I was going to buy the A-Wing model anyways because I've always been so fond of the design.

While I don't think it will ever rank up there as an all time favourite, it scratches an itch and it does it well.

This game reminds me of many of Avalon-Hill's 1970s-1980s games, in that Fantasy Flight has taken a simple idea--spaceship to spaceship combat with a Star Wars theme--and in its basic version come up with enough rules to put it in the medium-light to medium category of complexity. And that's okay, although it's going to take some time for two or more players to learn this game from scratch. Probably better to get taught by someone who already knows the rules. For example, unlike Milton Bradley's "Star Wars: Epic Duels," which was a game with miniatures, nice bits, and an intuitively easy-to grasp, clean gaming experience, "Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game" strikes me as more an argument for the superiority of video games in this particular context. Its 28-page rulebook, although in color and amply illustrated, is typical of many of the company's rule books--namely, wordy and written in so much detail that it has to be absorbed in multiple readings. However, players can start with the "Quick Play" version, which reduces the game to the basics of setting up, selecting ships and pilots, and moving and fighting. This is useful for learning the basics, and would be good for getting young kids into the game. For adults, however, a quick-play game or two and they've got the basics, and to really enjoy the game as designed, they'll need to jump to warp and start getting all the rules in their heads. To be fair, the 28-page rules book breaks down as follows: 9 pages of regular rules, a 2-page example of play, 2 pages of "additional rules," 3 pages of "advanced rules," and 4 pages devoted to three different "missions." The other 4 pages include a front cover, back cover "quick reference" guide, one page with an "overview" and one other page with a "component guide." And yes, I have played the "Quick Play" version, and yes, I've played with all the regular rules. Except for not having a board, and having to use a ruler to gauge whether one ship's firing field encompasses that of an enemy ship--a feature sure to produce arguments among highly competitive players--the design works. It depends a lot on what level of complexity you're seeking (as well as how much money you care to spend by purchasing the numerous additional ships). Good luck to two newbies trying to break this out of the box and work their way through the regular rules straight out of the box.  On the other hand, although it will take some work, it's not hard to understand. And yet...even though on balance I'd rate it light-medium in complexity, it's curiously fiddly to learn. Purchased new at Target, November 2012.

RATING: 5
A rather clean but costly game system, if you want expanded fleets. Manoeuvres are somewhat limited and the combat (attack/damage) system is too random for my taste. [I confess it's not the only sci-fi game in this case.] 

For once, my rating shows my below average desire to play the game again. [My other ratings reflect how I value the games.]

Obviously the theme is great, but was pleasantly surprised by how smooth the gameplay is.  The squad building is already interesting, even with only four ships released so far, and the games have been fun.  The second wave looks great, scares me with how much money I spent on wave 1.  With more games logged I will see if there is enough variety to bring the score up, or if the excitement of the theme fades and it goes down.

RATING: 7
Not a big fan or miniatures or pre-game element selection type stuff, but this played ok and I enjoyed it enough that I'd play again if someone else who was into it set up the scenario. Eerily similar in concept to Ace Of Aces and Wings Of War et al, as you'd expect, in that you secretly plan your maneuver and speed and then reveal / execute. It has a nice twist in that the best pilots move last and shoot fast, giving a double whammy. So a lot of the game is about guessing, double-guessing and then out-guessing where your opponent will go, aiming to have him in your sights and range after all the moves are done. If you did a normal move (as opposed to a high-stress move), you'll get to do an action, either a bonus mini-move or get a dice-manipulator token. The latter of which helps when you fire, which is a straight dice roll looking for hits, up against a defensive dice roll hoping for evades to cancel the hits. Play 'til things are blown up basically, unless you're playing a mission-type scenario. As such it's pretty clean and I'd say an improvement on the other games mentioned before. But the guts of it is out-guessing, which doesn't hold a lot of interest for me. The attraction is obviously how it brings the theme to life (even if it is at 1/50th normal movie speed) which it succeeds at, but not enough for me to invest.

Pretty sweet game.  Every sci-fi fan wants to pilot an X-Wing or TIE Fighter.  You really need to play with points to add the crew and weapons and other various upgrades/customizations. My only complaint is that the ships and movement tracks get bumped a lot which can alter positioning and firing arcs in a way that can't be accurately undone.

It is an OK game, I had to get out of playing it as I felt a necessity to keep up with all the ship expansions and due to the way FFG package upgrade cards with the ships you often feel you need more ships of a type than you need just  to get that card.

Also the rising cost of the expansions was making it harder and harder to keep up

I did find that the combat was very luck based, it can be mitigated to some extent but it often felt that it came down to who ever rolled better.

2012:Finally got to try the game yesterday. It was not as complex as I thought it would be, and thus easy to learn. We started with the "tutorial" game, and that was too simple, just move and shoot, so we moved up to a "full" 31p game after that, and that was a little more fun. 

I guess an 100p game will be even more interesting. 

For now I'll put the rating on a 7 for fun, but lacking complexity. 

2014: Have upped the rating somewhat. 

2016: After a year or so without playing I have started again, and also bought more new ships than I had before. I'm still not inclined to up the rating though. What I have realized is that especially since this is a two-player game the amount of fun it is varies much more with who you play with than the outcome in the game. 

The game has a significant random factor with the dice and many discussions after a game has been about how one won thanks to the roll of the dice rather than strategy.

A very thematic game, after selecting your crafts based on a maximum point allocation you must plan your movements in secret, without actually verifying that you won't crash and then shoot, both in a specific turn order. The game gets a little repetitive and if you fall behind, it is very tough to come back as you have less ships and one ship can dominate the game. Also battles are based on dice rolls, which can be frustrating at times. If you like the theme, you will likely enjoy it.

Played once in late 2013 or early 2014, 6p, one ship each. I liked it!

Oct 2014: Played two 100-point games. I had read that swarms were strong, so I conspired with my nephew on an all Imperial "cheap-ship" squad of 8-tie-fighters. We took on 4 cadillac rebel ships, and lost not a single tie. Obliterated my brother and my other nephew.

We restarted, using the same Imperial TIE squad. My brother shifted to the Falcon and a couple of cheap Rebel fighters, what he could afford for 100 points.

We lost this time, mostly due to a terrible 4th turn when I did not turn my Ties tight enough, and he picked them off one by one with the Falcon. It didn't hurt that the dice didn't cooperate very much, so perhaps a 3rd run same setup might have gone differently.

Either way - I love the game, and there is a place if you can afford it, for this and for ST:Attack Wing But, most people can probably not afford to do both.

Now, with the two new games announced from Fantasty Flight with the Star Wars label (Armada, and some ground-based version), I wonder if this game will fade into the space now holding the Star Wars Miniatures of many gamers, and my brother in particular. I dumped by Star Wars Starship Battles minis for $150 to someone just when X-Wing was being announced back in 2011.

As much as I like this game - I think I'll only be playing my brothers copy until the Next Big Star Wars Property comes out.

Dec 2015: Played a bunch of Armada, love that. However, tasted some games of Epic X-Wing. Ok let's do this. Now fully invested in X-Wing too, bought about 35 ships off eBay for $210, and have since added to it with two epic ships, and several additional Wave 5+ ships, with a big Cool Stuff preorder sitting out there. Have played another 10 games or so, and listened to probably 10 hours of Podcasts. I'm hooked.

May 2016: I have sold hundreds of dollars of my unplayed games, and purchased everything available for this, including duplicates, and epic ships. I also purchased extra copies of core sets and given them to two young guys I have also hooked on the game. I'm working on my 50th play, and only now have passed the obsession point. We were literally playing this 3-4 nights a week for about a month, the most I have played any game in my life. Partially, this was due to having a lot of free time, and partially the two ready opponents who are single and with a lot of free time as well.

However the game is really fantastic, with so much to explore. And so many great podcasts and websites and articles, and a really robust tournament scene (which I will likely never have opportunity to participate in, but it certainly makes for a vibrant game).

July: my buddies have burnt out, didn't make it to Veterans, I'm still super hooked, just spent $92 having HotAC printed deluxe.

April, 2017 - haven't played in a while. SW Destiny now here, and that's taken up my extra game cash. I picked up the custom rebel Tie, the Scum Protectorate fighter, but have skipped most everything else that has come out with wave 10 and 11.

My two regular opponents are now entering their early 20s and work, school, life has them pursuing other interests. My boys don't care for games much anymore either. That leaves my brother, three hundred miles away, and my only opponent. Makes things difficult.

I did give away a starter set to my friend Dave, who has an young son, but is a super geek, if not a gamer. He played a game vs. his wife, which I soured him to buy and AWing and an Interceptor off of amazon, so that's a good sign. He's unlikely to ever be more at best than a once a quarter gamer, probably more like once a year.

So I'm feeling like the arc for XWing is probably over.

Simple, but fun with the right setup and mission. 100pt forces are needed to play at a minimum. A single base set is just a demo of the game and only lets you see the potential. 

Be prepared to drop $100 minimum on the game. For a table top miniatures game that's a good deal.

I give this a range from 6 to 8 on score. Overall though it's probably more of a 7.5 It's an Ok game for the most part. Probably on par with something like Memoir 44.

There is a distinct difference between casual play and competitive play.  Casual play is outstanding as it can be thematic and focus on 'flying' skill and maneuvering.  Competitive play is (as of mid-2017) becoming somewhat burdensome as the game has a very distinct 'meta' in which squad building and combinations of pilots and upgrade cards often feels much more important than actual gameplay.  That being said, this is a very fun experience as the core game is extremely well designed.

Preliminary rating: 8, with a chance to go up. 

This game is fun, fast, and thematic. I've player 4 games with just one core set, and one 100 pt./side battle. Both are really fun in their own way. If you asked me right now, I'd opt for a 60-70 pt. game, as the 100 seemed to drag a bit.

11/15/12: Bought 2nd core set.

12/27/12: Changed rating to 9. Now that I've seen the Wave 2 ships, I see that squad building is going to have a ton of variety and be very interesting. This game is just outright fun to play, and I'm now fully on board for 100 pt games, though they will take 60-90 minutes to play.

09/25/13: Dropped down to 8. I really like this against evenly-skilled players, but the setup time for a one-off game can get ridiculous.

Just tried it.  It's simply Wings of War, but in a bad way.  A copy that is pure hype, if you want to copy something do it well.  The only "good thing" is the dice roll instead of those cards and the lovely minis, however, the final result is horrendous.

(10+ plays)  We've had a couple of games where the game mechanics and theme played out so well with the drama - this whole system works far better than I expected.  Even with the base tutorial scenario, you can have a Tie Fighter a dogging the X-Wing - so he just can't shake him or the stress token - until that desperate moment where just the right guess sets up a focused shot.  Explosion.  Game over.  Let's try a DIFFERENT mission!  ... sure, which one?

Yeah, this is a great one.

Wings of glory's meta gaming big brother. If you like games where you pay more money regularly to get the best game winning combo's then this is for you. If you want a game where you can play pick up games versus anyone and not suffer meeting "that guy" then avoid X-wing like the plague.

Nice minis, which are well painted. A pretty good ship to ship combat game. But you really do need tonnes of the ships (including duplicates) to get the sort of space battles seen in the movies. Only really worth while, also, if you know someone else who's also really into it as the pre-game squad building is really important.

A lot of fun while both sides have 2 or more ships at their control. Less so when the game is down to 2-3 ships total. You end up in a Scooby Doo situation, where both players circle each other for an unnecessary amount of time trying to get hits.

I didn't play this very much as i get tired of non progressive games very quickly. All though this may not be something i play much of in the future i do massively appreciate the beauty of the game, from the paint jobs on the models, to the amazing system for stacking conditions on you mini's. All of this game is a must have for a collector in my humble opinion. 

The game play its self is very smooth, i was able to teach two new players at a time in maybe 15 mins, i got total tabletop noobs, and new gamers alike to play this game with me in the short time it was on my table. Beauty.

Similar to Wings of War, but with much cooler bits.   I suck horribly at this kind of game (programmed curving movement) as I always misjudge the angle/curve/distance and I also zig when I should have zagged.  That all being said, I really look forward to playing this more.

This game itself is great but I do not like the way it evolves. At first I was ok with upgrade cards that were only in certain sets to force you to buy them all as I have all and even multiple copies of some but I hate the 3rd faction they introduced last year and now even the new core set that killed the game for me. Very little inovation - reskinned TIE fighter and X-Wing with pilots named after greek letters. It feels just like cheap rip off of the original core set same way as the SW7 movie was cheap rip off of the OT.

RATING: 9
This game is really fun. You control a squad of Imperial or Rebel starships and fight against your opponent in a tabletop dogfight. The rules are simple to learn and the combat system is great. This game really gives you the feel of flying a starship, as each ship has their own maneuver dial and can move differently from another starship class. The ships can also be fitted with upgrades that is customizable to your playing style. 


I still have the original box, but all the components are stored in 2 Plano cases. I also have a custom made 3'x 3' star playmat.

This game is so much fun to play, both the game itself and the metagame.

The game itself has a lot to think about on different levels. You're trying to outguess and outmaneuver your opponent, and thinking through which actions will give your ships the best effectiveness. It does take 5-10 minutes to teach, but it offers a lot of strategic depth. The minis also look amazing on the table and make the whole experience immersive and fun for my inner child who just loves playing with cool toys. :)

The metagame is almost more fun to me. Fantasy Flight does a great job of keeping balance in the ship-building options while constantly adding variety and fixing older ships that didn't quite work. There are lots of different builds that are effective and it's fun to play around with online squad-building tools trying to find a fun and effective combination.

Own two of it, actually...

An OK miniature game. Gameplay didn't blow me away, but the minis are gougeous! I'd have it even if I couldn't play it.

Bad thing, just 3 ships in the base box feels kind of lame imho. But, wth, I'm buying it.

EDIT: Downgrading because of the lame X-Wing. It's the ship that gives name to the game, and it has become just crap.

It's like playing some Street Fighter where Ken and Ryu are clearly underpowered.

I may be back to it when they release a fix.

Overall the game does feel a good deal like the property they ripped off/learned from, but adds a bunch of stuff that I can see appealing to some, but adds a quirkiness and level of complexity that does nothing for me.

Wings of War is great to me because it uses nothing but cards (and a range ruler), and so has a low price impact, and then also really accurately reflects historical aerial combat. 

Star Wars Xwing Miniatures is just... two steps removed from that, taking WWII dogfighting, applying it to space, and then making a game about space WWII dogfighting and extrapolating its rules from WWII dogfighting games. Wut?

RATING: N/A
I'll take "things I never thought I'd like" for $400, Alex. 

I was never a miniatures gamer, have no interest in them, do not want to paint any miniatures, and ordinarily I have no draw to theme or realism. Neither do I have any interest in hovering over a table making sure my elbows don't inadvertently knock into something while holding a ruler and quibbling about whether or not line of sight is obstructed because I'm a millimeter too far to the left and so can't shoot you. I also have exactly one DNA strand in my body that is sympathetic to science fiction. It is a Star Wars strand (no prequels, please). 

I'm kind of stunned at how simple this game was to learn, but also by how much there was to do, and manage, and have fun with. The game is a simple sequence of making orders, flying a ship, taking actions, fighting, and then resolving. Then you do it again. It all flows really well, it's clean, it's intuitive, and you can mix and match abilities to try and gain little efficiencies for those different points in the sequence. Maybe this game you add some crew to adjust your special actions; next game you choose a different kind of torpedo. It's customizable and variable, and for this Star Wars fan it's a lot of fun. 

Ultimately, I honestly don't even really care if there's a highly strategic game here at all. Right now it's worth the price of admission to play this with my son and chase each other around the dining room table, making laser noises and hunting down one another's best pilots. 

Although [i]what[/i] a price of admission. I have zero interest in the expanded universe ships (what the hell is an E-Wing?) and do not want anything to do with the larger sized models; this fits in one reasonable-sized box in a closet, and that has a lot of value to me. It's a bit annoying how the core set is only three ships, but I picked up a couple extra ships and I'm pretty sure I'm calling it a day with this one. When I was researching this, I watched a few video reviews and some reviewers were already pointing out how some expansion packs were correcting imbalances to make certain ships viable, so I think some Power Creep with this is inevitable. 

I have negative interest in tournaments and have no intention of ever playing this against anyone other than my son and maybe a friend who also knows Star Wars well. I can certainly see how people go down the rabbit hole with this game and end up with 48 TIE fighters and a two-foot-long Tantive IV to escort across a giant table over a two-hour battle, but while I like this game , I don't like it [i]that[/i] much; this is a 30-minute game for me. Any longer and it gets more than a little repetitive, so 2-3 small ships at a time is perfectly OK.

While I prefer historial setting of Wings/Sails of War/Glory over the Star Wars, I have to say that FFG managed to get the mechanics right here. Gameplay is very smooth and enjoyable. Only real gripe for me is that Card decks are not sold as stand alone. Getting the upgrades you want requires to buy a ship you do not need. 

Well, made myself a reference sheet for all the cards, so we can build our squadrons with all the available upgrades now.  Works for me and my group.

This is such a cool game, specifically the spatial dogfighting. Zooming around the table and dodging each other's firing arcs is a riveting tactical experience.
However, X-Wing is massively bogged down with fiddly design.  Half of play time is spent updating tokens, dealing with clunky positioning rules, and sorting out who can do what and when.
On top of that, actual combat is heavily skewed towards randomness.  The best tactics and god-like dogfighting ability won't save you from unlucky dice rolls.  After a few plays, it begins to feel like it doesn't matter what you field or what you do, who wins is up to fate.

I decided to try it when I saw that they would release the Millenium Falcon and boy am I glad I did! There is a perfect balance making it a light beer'n'bretzel game and very immersive tactically at the same time. Games are quick and fast-pace, not much dragging. Squad building is very fun and there doesn't seem to be must-have pilot for the moment; some are clearly better and safer choice, but the game is not won before it start by poor squad building.

I really wanted to rate this higher, but after a year of playing I have had too many games come down to the results of the dice.  With the imbalance of the falcon's 360 degree death turret, there are still too many flaws in this game that kill the "who is a better pilot" aspect of the game.  That being said, the game is extremely thematic and with the exception of a few flaws, highly competitive.

Certainly don't begrudge gamers going nuts over this - clean, tense and fun game with great looking minis and enough add-ons to create campaigns and an immersive universe. 

Personally, never been a tactical plane/ship/car fighter fan. This does it well, but still the move and shoot genre just doesn't quite do it for me. More interesting than Wings of War, I think, but WoW is a little quicker and this can overstay its welcome. Would have loved this as a 14 year old (to replace Car Wars) but doesn't offer enough now to play anything more than a diverting dog fight.

Great miniatures that really captures the look and feel of Star Wars combat. The game itself is solid, with nice components, familiar mechanics, and a nice pace. That said, it's the meta-game that hooked me. I don't even want to consider the time playing around with builds on my phone or computer.

I had a comment written here previously that was made before I properly got into the game. I said it didn't do enough to excite me. I was wrong. Maybe I just needed to take a proper crack at it. Maybe I needed the variety of more expansions to be released (I initially bought it when the Falcon was released) but I'm hooked now. My go to competitive game besides Netrunner.

2017 update: Fell out of love with X-wing due to the competitive meta being awful for over a year because of a poorly balanced expansion. Still a good game at its core though and maybe I'll get back into it once they've ironed out some of the problems.

This is a great game and can even be modified to let my younger nephews play it quite easily.  The big downside is it can turn into a money pit with all of the expansions.  I'm also not a big fan of the set-up time, as you go through everything to try and outfit your ships.  (This isn't a problem with the base game alone.  It is a product of having a large amount of expansions.)  This probably wouldn't be an issue if I played more, but it just doesn't get to the table all that often.  

With all that said, once you're set up and ready to go it is a lot of fun to play.  It's also fun collecting your fleet of ships (if money permits.)

I can't believe I'm writing this, but I LOVE THIS GAME. I didn't expect to--in fact, I had buyer's remorse after placing the order, but for no reason.  This is a beautiful game.    Two core sets and a few expansions later--I'm a convert. Highly recommended for fans of Star Wars, or just those who love a great thematic tactical    game experience.

RATING: 4
The people rating this as 10/10 have probably either never played another board game before or are blindly following their Star Wars fanboy-ism.

The game relies VERY heavily on luck (as in, rolling the dice), and even the best strategy you can possibly come up with becomes absolutely useless if you manage to not roll a "hit" or if the opponent manages to evade. Not to mention, most abilities of the crafts and/or the pilots still require you to roll at least a success.

The playmat (which costs a whooping €50) is just a black cloth that doesn't even provide you with a grid to properly place the ships: in fact, you will have to be EXTREMELY careful whenever you want to do anything or you risk altering the positions of the elements on the field. Too many times you will accidentally modify the placement of something with no way of knowing their previous position.

Finally, this game also includes a quite strong element of "pay-to-win" (although it's not the only game that does that, for sure) for many reasons: first, it's IMPOSSIBLE to play a standard match with just the basic set, as the typical fleet strength is 100, which is way higher than the ships included in there; second, in order to create a balanced team you will need to buy additional ships which are also not cheap.

Overall, this is a game I would not recommend even to Star Wars fan, as it is flawed in its fundamentals and there are other similar games that play way better than this, with much less focus on pure luck.

EDIT: Also when touching the X-Wings you have to be EXTREMELY careful, as the laser cannons of the ships from the Force Awakens and the Leagcy set are very fragile.

From a wargame background, this game hits a good price point and works for a light game.  If you're not looking for this to replace your current Warmachine, Malifaux or Warhammer game, it's worth it.

One suggestion: Don't play Imperials vs. Imperials.  It makes for a very long game.

Simple miniatures dog fight game.  You each select a few ships.  You simultaneously select the flight pattern for that turn (movement of 1-4 inches).  Then you move all the ships and take a shot if anyone is in the attack arc (and range) of your ship(s).  Last ship surviving wins the game.

My 11-year-old daughter and I had a great time playing this game.

It's a good game.  I only have the base set.  I'm not sure that a bunch of different ships would enhance the game that much. but I'm not a Star Wars collector.

Simple enough to play with my six-year-old, but with enough depth to make it interesting for adults.  That's good game design.

Plus, the theme.  Oh, heck, the theme.  The game makes you feel like you're in a desperate shootout with Imperial Lackeys/Rebel Scum.  It's really a perfect marriage of theme to game mechanics.

We've invested in a lot of the expansions, and we just have a blast lining 'em up for dogfights.  Plus, the metagame aspect of building up a force before a game is a lot of fun, and is teaching my kids good stuff.

We've also started playing a campaign game at our FLGS, which has strong RPG elements.  My two boys (5 & 7) love this, and they're enjoying identifying personally with a pilot.

This isn't really my sort of game - miniatures, with no board and movement measured by "rulers" which come with the game - yet I found it quite entertaining when I was introduced to it by another member of my local games club in January 2015. I can see why this game has such a wide following, and has so many expansions with new ships and abilities - I think these would add a lot to the game. And yet, while I quite enjoyed it, this isn't a game I ever see myself actively wanting to play - no matter how many expansions might be added. I've not played it since that first game, and I'm not sure I ever will again.

RATING: 8
Components (ie, ships) in this game are FABULOUS! As I've got older, I have less time for painting and want more time for playing - so I've been happy to sacrifice looks in game. Well, x-wing has it all. The ships look very accurate to the movies/books and have an extremely nice pre-paint job. I originally bought the game just for the models alone, as I'd be happy just keeping some for display purposes (what kid of my generation didn't want a Millennium Falcon beside their bed!)

Getting past that, the game mechanics are extremely solid. I appreciate that the individual ships aren't the cheapest - but with a core set and a couple of extra ships, you have all you'd ever need. 

For tournament play, it's a little annoying that some of the best pilot/equipment cards can only be found on ships you might not want to purchase (ie, on the large ships which hold no interest for me) - but that's not going to annoy most players.

The next annoying bit is finding somewhere to play - not everyone has a kitchen table big enough to house the size that the play area should be. But for casual games, making do in a tighter space is fine as both players are similarly limited :)

Overall, I really enjoy x-wing!

This game combines two very important things: lots of meaningful decisions in squad-building AND fun, exciting, fast-paced game play.  In that way it provides a rewarding experience during and between games.

We've played a 3-player short introduction game. The scenario was 2 X-Wings versus one Tie-Fighter.

This is a tabletop game where the rules are not so complex. I like the components that help with the navigation of the ships, like curves of different angles. There's luck involved with the dice that determine hits and misses. But I think that good navigation decisions lead to victory, especially when each player controls several space ships. In this case, a good navigator will provoke a situation where he has several space ships simulataniously fireing at a single defending ship. This is a very tactical game.

This base game contains only 3 ships: 1 Tie fighter and 2 X-Wings. I guess there need to be more ships to have a tactically satisfying experience. Maybe it's better to right away buy two boxes instead of one.

 I read the rules and like all great games it seems like this one is easy to execute but full of subtlety. Looks like a very elegant system to use to achieve aerial combat. Its slightly 2d, but I think Fantasy Flight did a bang up job.

I have played a couple of games so far and I am still digging the basic concept. The ability of building squadrons and trying out different combos is so far a lot of fun. 

I would not have picked this game up for the cover price, but with a buy in of 12 bucks from Target I now have 4 core sets (oonly have punched or opened 2) and at least one of all the fighter expansions. Otherwise the buy in is high, but if you can find it cheaper go all in.

I might buy another Star Wars game if it come out but not by FFG. They just regurgitate the same old crap. I'm sure this one will have a second edition any time now...I used to enjoy FFG then I saw how there business is modeled towards it's consumer and it's just shite. Oh but enough about FFG. This game is okay. That's about it. Star Wars makes it seem better than it is but it's just okay. Another mindless dice chucker.

A neat game that is more than just pretty minis.  Compared to Armada, it is faster paced but with more variance.  Each roll and each maneuver has much more randomness, but you will make more of them over the course of the game.  So, it's not necessary high on luck, but individual outcomes can feel that way.  I prefer Armada's more steady pace with more emphasis on planning one really high stakes maneuver well.

While Armada has a few balance problems, they seem small compared to what happens when you play X-wing seriously.  In armada, a couple of price tweaks and everything works well; nothing clumsy, nothing major.

10-03-2014. I admit, I am not a miniature gaming guy. I admit, I love this game. I must say, I've played mainly scenario 1 repeatedly. 

I like the simplicity of the movement and combat system, after 2 games I've introduced 2 other people to the game and it went over perfectly. The robustness of the game allows you the modify and change stuff on a whim, while keeping a nice balance. Unofficial variants work great (screw 2' x 2').

Games are tense, dice heavy and easy to execute. Hidden movement with dials is very fun, since you need to get into the head of your opponent. Cards with different abilities are provided for and add great flavor to the game. Importantly, (almost) all information you'll need is on the cards/ship to help you memorize/notice your options.

I admit, I think some of the things in this game are a little clunky but I admit the design far outshines my downsides listed here. For example, I think that all the counters are not so interestingly designed and well executed as they could've been (dull!).  I dislike moving the pieces using cardboard rulers and such that allow you to push over the figures. Also, the figures get in the way of maneuvering. I guess these are all small gripes inherent in miniature gaming. As mostly a boardgame enthusiast, I guess a grid would've worked just as well.. I get really annoyed by me pushing over other people's figures the whole time though ;).

All in all. A new favorite game for me.

I'm a heavy-duty Wings of War player and I find it amusing as hell how long it takes to play single moves in this game.  It's not a problem, because a typical game runs maybe eight moves.  People die quickly in this one.  But as with all things FFG, the simple concept has been deluxified with dozens of special rules in play in each game, likely different every time.  FFG sure knows how to pour chocolate sauce over top of everything.

Enjoyed playing it last night, hope to play again soon.  

As luck would have it I was with a bunch of good guys that didn't care all that much when ships weren't placed exactly right or things got bumped.  I could see how this game could kick off some real fights with people who gave a damn though!

This game is great. Not only has it got great looking components, but the rules are easy to teach as well. Still, it's a game in the 'easy-to-learn-hard-to-master-category' as good tactics will win the game more often than not.

For a miniatures game, this is relatively inexpensive. You can provide two players with enough options for variable army lists for the same amount of money a rulebook and starter army would cost in most miniature game systems. And the miniatures are pre-painted to a very good quality, so this game doesn't need any investments in paints and brushes.

Squad Building gets me back into the vibe of my old LotR-miniature game tournament days.

Giving this game a 6 is quite upsetting. The game was easily my favorite of all time (I easily have over 300 plays). But being a living game more items are added in and the power creep was just getting out of control, forcing me to stop playing.

RATING: 10
Consider this a rating for the game in general, rather than this specific set.

X-Wing might be the best miniatures game I've ever played. Like all minis games it's clearly a money pit, and it's a difficult game to get into because of that. But the gameplay itself is just about perfect. It's immediately accessible, partially because everyone understands Star Wars, but also because it's fun at its most basic level. It'd be reasonable for someone to buy just a few ships along with the core set, and they will have enough to keep them busy for a while. But FFG is betting that people won't want to stop there, and it's not hard to see why that is. This is a great game.

This game's squad-building system is very interesting, and requires a lot of fun trial and error. It makes the luckiness of the dice seem less pronounced and gives you a sense of ownership over your team. 

Its main mechanisms are fine, if sometimes a bit fiddly (this is my only miniatures game - maybe I'm just uninitiated). The combat dice seem to undermine your best-laid plans a bit too often, though many of the cards allow you to augment your results.

Played the game 5 times. One game with the 3 ships from the starter set, the other 4 with multiple expansions. This game is amazing with expansions and upgrade cards from expansions. It is especially fun to play with someone who loves Star Wars and can quote the movie during the game. I love this game!

Update. 
The more I play this game the more I like it. I love the squad/upgrade building system. 
Update.
Love the game even more. I am about 30 games in and love the game even more. 
Update 
putting my whole collection up for trade because of how clunky and clogged up movement can become when multiple ships collide. This aspect of the game really diminished my enjoyment of the whole system.

A fantastic dog-fighting spaceship game system. The rules are clear and simple, but when coupled with the ships individual abilities and the gear you outfit them with offers excellent customization and opportunity for clever play.

My games of this haven't been very strategic quite honestly.  It's just fly your ships into each other, and see who gets lucky with dice rolls.  Wanted to love this one, but maybe I'm just not good at it.

RATING: 10
(x3 Core Sets) This is definitely "my game." Other games? Those are what I play so that I don't burn out on X-Wing ;) But in all seriousness, this was my first intro into tactical miniatures gaming and I play it pretty rabidly.

EDIT (2016): Still a favorite game of mine, and I still collect it rabidly, but unfortunately, I rarely find time to play as often as I used to. I aim for a game every one or two weeks now and feel lucky when that happens. Still really love the game though and still have to have everything for it!

EDIT (2017): No longer actively play or collect like I used to. Still in my collection and I still enjoy it quite a bit, but gone from my wishlist are new expansions. :/

This was fun. Would I have thought this was as much fun if it wasn't Star Wars? Probably not.

I can't get over how expensive this is. You only get three ships with the base game, and they don't even give you enough dice for every pilot's abilities. (Luke can roll 4 attack dice, but they only give you 3.) Of course, you can buy a pack of 6 dice for another $10! Or...what makes the most financial sense is to just buy another base set. So now you're at $60 (if you buy online), and you only have 2 x-wings and 4 tie fighters. Y-wings and advanced tie fighters are blister packs for another $15 retail. The Millenium Falcon will be $30!!

The worst part is that I know my boys would LOVE this game. LOVE IT.

Completely addicted to this game, despite my initial resistance to the "collection creep" of so many expansions. Every time I play is a blast (no pun intended), and collecting all the cool little ships is hugely appealing to the little kid in this 40-year-old body. I think it's a great balance between on the one hand being very playable with nearly any combo of ships you might try in a casual setting, to having all sorts of interesting depth when you're trying to optimize squads for a competitive setting. It's very accessible price-wise, to pick up a Core set and one or two ships that you think look cool, but of course can get expensive if you start to try to be completist or really competitive. In the end, though, I also love that player skill in terms of flying your squads on the table is a huge part of it, and it's not just meta-game analysis and buying special cards to be competitive. Pew pew!

My standard for miniatures skirmish games is WoW minis, and I didn't think this was as fun.

Nice quality game, but setup time can be a bit to long, and requires some time to play with a little to singular repetitive game-play for lasting appeal.

As a gauge, he didn't mind if I sold it on compared to other games he would like me to keep.

This is a fun miniatures game. It plays incredibly quickly, and you don't need to use a ruler to measure a certain number of inches for movement, which is a huge plus for me. It's a bit random, but the fast paced game play leads to an engaging, enjoyable game.

Gaming really doesn't get any better than this. X-Wing is fun, fast, and infinitely replayable. I can see myself loving this for years and years to come.

Playing this game feels exactly as it should - like a real dogfight in space. The Star Wars theme shines through beautifully, and the miniatures are GORGEOUS.

One of my all-time favourite games.

Good fun with the kids. During first play combat devolved into a turn fight and wasn't very interesting. Second play we tried a mission from the rule book and it it was much more interesting.

Update: Played a few more times with Epic ships, missions, and standard 2v2. It continues to impress with is relative simplicity, but depth of play. I really should play it more.

Such a beautifully produced game and a clean rule-set that conjures up images of space dogfights. Never played a miniatures game before, so was unprepared for the time invested in setup. With the game already set up though, this would be a treat to play.

Refreshing for a 'board' to be so open and have rules enforced by ships and movement templates.

A great game with a great international community of gamers. If you fall to it prepare to spend tons of money in spaceships.

Loving it so far.

2-8-13.  Upgrading this to a 9.0.  Always thinking about this game (at least when work isn't distracting me).  Every time I read about a new build idea, I want to immediately try it out.   This game has legs, it is awesome fun to play, and a nice a mix of skill & luck determine success.  I want to play this until I feel like a master of the system (how I used to feel after playing a MOBA for a long period of time).  I love this game.

4-1-17:  Downgrading just a bit to 8.5  I still think this is a great game, and it's probably the only miniatures game I'll ever play.  I'm dinging it because of set-up and time to play.  I've never been able to finish a full 100-point game in under 2 hours, and it just gets a bit exhausting towards the end.  Maybe it's because I'm slow and my friends are slow, but this is definitely not a 30-45 min game.  I should note that I stopped buying new ships early on and have a very limited collection, which I'm very happy with.  There's too much bloat in the game nowadays, and I don't want to be checking a FAQ every time I play.

A great minis game set in the Star Wars universe. Dog fighting is fun and the game is very thematic and true to the IP. A lot of unnecessary expansions have been released lately, but you can also just buy multiple copies of ships that are actually in the movies. Worth playing.

I was drawn to this game due to the style of play. The freeform "board' being a designated play area you move around in, measuring and calculating appealed to me. I am not a major star wars fan, but I do like the movies, so it was worth a go. 

A good friend and I found it extremely fun to play, and immediately after "testing" it out with just the core set, I set forth and got another core set and one of each expansion, which is rare for me to do. 

It's a very interesting game with a lot of re-playability, since no game plays the same twice in a row. Highly recommended.

In the end however, the ever increasing amount of minis that they kept pushing out killed this for me. I just feel utterly abused by FFG at all the pieces they keep trying to get me to buy. In the end, you're into this FAR more then what it's worth.

Wings of war meets Techno Witches with a thick layer of FFG Chrome (pilot cards, abilities and lots of die rolling for battles!). Oh, and hefty licensing fees to Lucasarts for the SW theme!

Only gripe: it's rather overpriced. The base set gets you...three (ouch) ships and associated bits and pieces.

They should sell cards seperately for those who would prefer proxies instead of having to purchase expensive minis to expand the set.

Update: A WWI plane movement system doesn't translate well to a futuristic space battle. It's fine for a Sopwith Camel to trundle ahead slowly but not for star ships. The license is excellent but somehow, it just doesn't gel for me.

I can't picture two adults actually playing this game together without whoever suggested the idea getting embarrassed.  Realising it's a game monkeys can learn they have tried to complicate it with the expanded rules but when you look at these you realise that they are really only canceling each other out, so what is the point of the extra rules.

Lovely quality components, and like my love ww2 planes we all want to love this game...But we all know it's a money making scam that we gladly get sucked into to...overpriced, offers too little for price and keeps expanding...

Top components, improved gameplay etc over wings of war/glory, but like WOW it's just well...

It's a game for kids or one that you play with the kids.

There is so much to like but I just don't think their is a way to make the system work without a radical overhaul.

Although I do think taking the components of this game and using them with my wings of glory planes certainly makes wings of glory more playable.

Playing it with kids it's a high score, maybe 7.  The components are a 10, but the serious game play is about a 3?
But seeing as I play this only with the kids I have rated it appropriately, and am Happy to buy or trade items for this game.

tight little filler game that can be squeezed in on a school night. not the most satisfying game experience, but worthwhile when in the mood to push some chipboard and plastic around.

The set up and table space needed for this game is a bit awkward. I also feel you'll need to buy the other ships to get this game at its full potential. I do enjoy this game. I love reading my opponents and figure out what their intentions are. I just dislike the spacial awareness and measuring aspect of this game. It feels cluttered and one small displacement or accidental movement of the pieces can disrupt the game heavily.

Elég nagy gondban vagyok az egyik legjobban felkapott játék értékelésekor. Egyrészt minimális a világról az ismeretem, 1-2 Csillagok háborúja filmet láttam, másrészt a játék a Wreckage-hez hasonló asztalon vonalzóval tologatós játék. A Wreckage-re anno pedig jó szívvel adtam egyes osztályzatot. Szóval nem könnyű. Az alapjáték három hajót tartalmaz, ami nevetségesen kevés pár játék után, szóval muszáj kiegeket vásárolni. Cserében nagyon szépek a miniatűrák, jól kidolgozott az egyes pilóták tulajdonsága, jól kigondolt a harc menete. A legjobban nekem az tetszett, hogy a hajóknak mindig muszáj mozogniuk így mindig érdekes szituációk alakulnak ki, nem fordulhat elő az, hogy x méterről állva lövöldözik egymást. A játék időtartam is jól belőtt. Szóval ég és föld az élmény a Wreckage-hez képest, de azért mégiscsak a vonalzózás a lényeg itt is. Aki Star Wars fanatikus, annak biztosan óriási élmény lehet a játék, de nekem, aki nem is fan és nem is rajong az ilyen típusú játékokért nem igazán "ezzel akarok játszani" játék. Szóval nagyon nehéz pontot meghatároznom. Tessék ezt a fentiek szellemében nézni.

Something of a guilty pleasure. Not in the sense that the game isn't good, but rather that it's very expensive. I guess you get your moneys worth all the same - the pre-painted ships look fantastic and if you can safely store them and all the associated materials without it taking over your living space, it's worth a look.

Is the game any good? Absolutely. It captures the dogfights of the films extremely well and is fast-paced and exciting with lots to do without getting overly complicated. It also (obviously) looks terrific in play. The only negatives are again the cost of buying the ships and the storage space this will take up. If you can figure something out and you're in any way a Star Wars fan, you need to give this a go.

Pros:

+ Double-blind action selection is always a win for me (rewards predicting opponent; I feel you should be rewarded for knowing what an opponent is going to do)

+ The game is quick and the dice-rolling is fun

+ Nice to look at

Cons:

-Slippery slope problem once the first ship dies

-I find measuring stuff to be a little clunky and at times ambiguous or subjective, though I understand this is the norm for miniatures games

Neutral:

*Stuff like variable play area size etc. makes the game feels casual for me, which is a fine mindset for this game because it's fun/funny to mess up your moves and crash into stuff and to take risks where you estimate you can ALMOST clear that asteroid or other ship... nope, doh!

* Seemed too simple at first, but that's because I didn't get the maneuvering yet and one of the ships I used was pretty simplistic (YT-1300). By the end of one play I "got" the game though. There aren't many rules/options but the ones that are there efficiently provide a full experience

For someone who never plays tactical minis game, this is an easy entry. I had 99% of the rules down in 15 minutes and rarely had to ask any questions. The movement, firing, and special abilities are all simple but crucial. Although our game seemed a tad slow, it did not dissuade me in the least from wanting to play again. And I'd like to play with missions to see how they play out. All in all, one of my highlights from 2012. I may be buying into this in a big way.

Minis are beautiful. Gameplay is fast and interesting. My only complaint is the price of collecting enough stuff to make games more interesting. The start box only comes with the absolute minimum to even play the game and isn't very interesting without more ships. I don't want to have to spend $100+ to make this fun for more than 2-3 games...

This game excites me.

Pew pew pew.

The tie phantom was completely laughably overpowered, which meant that my strategy was void when more than half of my ships got obliterated by it with two lucky attacks. These ships had managed to outmanoeuvre it and shoot at decent range about four times and came out with no hits.

But it was good fun. Quick, thematic, customisable. Star Wars goodness...next time I'm going straight for the phantom with everything.

AMAZING. I'm not much of a "collector", but every single expansion I've purchased for this game has been fun and rewarding.

RATING: 6.5
I would rate this game at an ~8 but being a big Star Wars fan since I was 4 years old, I have some personal gripes about the game. First I'll list the immediate Pros and Cons:

Pros: Optional campaign-like missions, well painted minis, easy to learn mechanics, advanced team-building, and tournament level gameplay/events.

Cons: easy to break/very fragile plastic stands and you need to keep an eye on errata updates due to ever-changing meta.

Now for my personal issue with the game:

The mixing of starfighters from Episode 7+ and the Original Trilogy really bothers me. Darth Vader was dead before Kylo Ren and the First Order ever existed, they shouldn't be able to be flown together. If they had separated the two eras into different "sub-games" I would have been okay with it but I understand that there are only a few ships available from the newest trilogy hence why they put them together.

I would have liked to see this game split into three different games with each game representing one of the three different eras depicted in the films [The Clone Wars, Galactic Civil War, and the First Order/Resistance Eras].

Fun out of box, but I think it could get boring real quick if you're not willing to spend the money to expand your fleet options. That makes this a very expensive game - especially when you realize how much money you've spent and how you need to spend even more to protect it. But if you can afford to buy enough of each ship type to make nearly an entire 100-point fleet out of a each ship type, your options for fleet building really open up.

Single rounds are short (30-60 min), so I think the real fun is going to come in building a fleet, playing it, and then playing it again with a slight variation. The more you learn how various ships/pilot interact, the more fun it will be to try new combinations.

Really looking forward to lots of plays in years to come.

The game is well constructed, with beautiful miniatures, but there was a reason that I gravitated from games like Warhammer to games like Blood Bowl.  I want games where you can count the spaces, not measure with a ruler; games where the determination of line of sight is a clear determination, not subject to opinion and possible argument by the participants.  

Simply put, I think this game was beautifully executed, but too fiddly.

Good fun game to begin with. We started with a single starter but went up to two starters and two small ship packs almost immediately. Compatible with the kids too - we can just each take a ship or ships. Sometimes battles did seem to bang on a bit too long so we needed to call time.

As time has went on (2 years now) the collection of ships has grown and the game is played more strategically.

I'd definitely say we have enough ships now and would really love if they did card packs. Of course its easy to print cards for this game with the information available on the internet.

Starter set comes with too little dice. Out of the box you need 4 in each colour so why supply 3??

It's obviously a good game.  The big problem with it is the Star Wars universe itself with basically two factions.  SO the source material limits it.  It's suitable for hardcore play.

The person that taught me the game on my first play didn't have a good handle on the rules, which resulted in me not being all that impressed.  Two friends that are huge star wars nerds convinced me to buy into it though now that a third faction has been released with each of us picking a faction (meaning a lot less money to get into it.) After going through the rulebook myself I am blown away, this game is great, & can't wait to play it again.
Edit: Still loving this game, I quickly broke out of sticking to one faction, FFG knows what they are doing.

Not a huge 2-player gamer. This is interesting, but ultimately just feels a bit slow for what I'd want. Without the theme the game would not be rated nearly so high. My rating is based on the game mechanisms alone.

EDIT: Lost a half a point due to all the complexities and things added in future expansions. There are a ton of imbalances in the game now and some really annoying things to deal with if someone abuses certain combos. Still an OK game overall, but not something I'll seek out unless I'm really, really in the mood.

Faster and more streamlined than wings of war, AND IT'S STAR WARS, what's not to love!

you need two core, three core would be better and the x-wing and tie expansions. the core comes with extra templates, dice and tokens.

all the best pilots are in the expansion packs Wedge, Backstabber and Howlrunner, so they are must haves.

The game hinges on 100 point battles
three core and the expansions will give you 4 x-wings,
a worthy x-wing squad.
but more importantly you will have 7 tie fighters one of the best squads in the game.

later on add the falcon, slave 1 a single tie advanced (for Vader)

later still add in 1 interceptor,and 2-3 b-wings(B-wings are incredible)

The interceptor aces pack is out so buy two of those then you can have 5 interceptors.

tie bombers are cool, but I have yet to make them work, (I have 3)

y-wings are fun, but not necessary. I own 3.
a-wings look cool but more often than not waste points. I have 4.
unless you want the cards, don't buy the shuttle, it is awful. I have 3.

The moldy crow-hawk290 puts too much of a target on it's back to be a viable option, but the cards are nice.

first tournament:
first decide which side you want to play, rebels or empire.

next, how many ships will you be comfortable flying in the set amount of time?

Tournament rounds are usually 75 minutes, if the time is less than that, I recommend not taking a swarm (6 or more ships).

how many different dials are you going to be able to fly at once, different dials can cause confusion.

for rebels I recommend keeping it simple. 

Two Falcons,
one falcon
----- and 2 x-wings,
----- and 2 b-wings,
----- and one x and one B
4x
2x and 2b
2x and 2y
3b and 2a

all the above lists are highly competitive, it depends on your piloting skill and upgrades on how well they work.

The rebel side has a little more hitting power and in the current state (meta) are a little better.

for imperials, more ships is usually better.

6-7 ties
5 ties and vader
4 ties and 2 advanced
2 firesprays with HLC
one firespray and 3 or 4 ties

or if you want to run something hard

one or two shuttles plus bombers.

above all have fun, sit down between rounds, drink plenty of water, eat.

I thought this game would be  hit with my son.  He didn't care for Wings of War...we were bad pilots and ended up flying around the table without being able to shoot at each other.  I thought the cool mini's would attract him too.  Well, he did like the mini's but he is not that much of a Star Wars fan anymore.  I played with both kids and there was more action, but they only thought it was ok.  When I suggested we could pick up more ships they both said they were not interested in controlling more than 1 ship.  I thought about picking up Slave 1, but they just were not that excited about the game.  With their excitement being low and the cost of the game being high I put it up for a math trade.  I am looking at The Battle at Kembler's Cascade for our spaceship combat game.  We do have and enjoy Quantum though.

For now my rating is a tentative one based on a few short plays with son Sam (he is not overly interested in playing again) and on my expectations of what the game might have to deliver given the opportunity to get some play.....

X-Wing was smoother than I thought it would be. I like that they've taken steps to balance out crafts and crew so that you can play with 2 ships/fleets and have some impression that they are equal. But beyond that, there's nothing here to make me want to pick this up over Wings of Glory; this is more cumbersome and has more rules.

It's perfectly fine, but it's just a shame that FFG feels the current need to remake everything with a Star Wars licence.

Update: Just over a year later and I've gotten into X-Wing in a big way. My own personal way in was through the fan made Arturi Cluster which made the game co-op (against an AI). Whereas usually FFG games like this are intended for a player to build an army or deck and take it to a tournament, Arturi allowed players to work together and so the large combos and overpowered chains are for all players' benefit, making the game much more accessible and appealing.

From there I've developed a taste for building squads and the depth of the game has slowly revealed itself. And what a wonderful game it is. It has some serious luck elements in it and a lot of the game is about managing and mitigating that luck. Suddenly the meta is interesting for the first time for me.

Rating up from 7 to 9.

The old-school X-Wing and TIE Fighter computer games are some of my favorites of all time.  While this doesn't capture *every* element of the game (I'm probably going to design my own shield deflector/redirection mechanic) it really does bring back so many memories of my youth.  The core set does not come with enough ships, so expect to pay at least double the cost of the base set in order to really enjoy this.  It's a lot more tactical than Battleship Galaxies (and I sometimes use pieces from it as NPCs when playing this) but there's some strategy involved when playing missions that aren't just "blow the other guy up."

playing this game both at turnaments and just with friends, I can say this game is bloody amazing, the only "NAAAGGGH!" there is with this game is that some of the older ships are slightly underpowered compared to the newer ships, and needs a lot of rework to be playable. - regardless this is the best miniature game in the world.

X-Wing is a perfect miniatures game, bridging the gap between board/card games and miniature games.  It is very simple for a wargame but still complicated enough for some serious enjoyment and mastery.  

The game does the Star Wars theme amazingly well,  you actually feel like a pilot, and the movement system is extremely unique. 

This game is my 2nd favorite Star Wars game of all time, next to only Rebellion, and I have highly considered raising this game to a 10 ranking.

Really good game with a neat concept, I like the building your fleet before a battle aspect as well as the movement and fighting mechanics. It is sometimes hard to play near younger players as they think it is a toy haha. If I had more ships I would maybe rate this higher, but just the base game is plenty to keep you busy for a while and learn the rules.

Edit 1: Have around 21 ships (16 unique models) and really have been enjoying the game.

Love this game.  Unfortunately, I gave it up for a while to play Star Trek: Attack Wing.  X-Wing's ships are costed correctly, so much so, you really have to make hard decisions on what to include in your fleet an what to cut.

I play it whenever I can...locally, regionally, Nationally, and at Worlds.  I'm not the greatest, but it sure is fun!

Updated Dec 2017: having playtested this for FFG for the past few years and seeing the core mechanics of the game change, I have sold my entire collection, including 5 years worth of promo cards, device, templates, etc.

This is an excellent 2 player tactical strategy game. This is the one miniature game I play which is important because the cost of the expansions adds up quick. It is important to find a local group of x-wing players because this is far too complicated for a family game. For those looking for a list building game which makes you think about your strategy before, during, and after a game this is an excellent choice.

 It requires a bit of an investment, but it's incredibly fun as a hobby.  The game-play itself is a great mix of strategy, tactics, skill, and luck.  It's fast-paced, with basically no down-time from start to finish, which makes playing a match super absorbing.  I've been really enjoying it as a hobby, as the organized play community is thriving, and what could be better than hanging out drinking beer and playing X-Wing?

 The squad-building aspect is another layer that adds lots of replayability to the game, as there are basically endless viable configurations of ships, pilots, and upgrade cards to experiment with.  There's so much variety, that everyone can have a different approach to the game, and Fantasy Flight has done a nice job of steadily releasing new ships, while keeping the meta in balance and fairly diverse.

The games always devolve into ships just running into each other and moving around each other blindly, and victory comes down to pure luck of the dice. Watching some of the tournament games online confirms that this even happens with more experienced players. The luck of the dice can't really be mitigated, so it's not uncommon to roll four or five dice to try to get that last hit on your opponent, then watch as you roll poorly and they avoid any damage.
This has to do with the even dice distribution. You're as likely to roll a hit as your opponent is to roll an evade. I like the Summoner Wars approach better where the attacker is more likely to roll a success, so it keeps the game length down and those big dice rolls are more reliable. The game also drags on for way too long because of this. I haven't actually finished a full game because we usually call it quits after just one or two ships get destroyed and well over an hour has passed.

All of that aside, I like a couple of things about the game. The variety, especially with a few expansions, is really high. For each ship, you've got several different pilots who all work a little differently, plus lots of different upgrades to choose from each game. Another big selling point is the simplicity, once you get past a few fiddly rules involving ship collision and obstacles. You just program your moves, move your ships, attack, and repeat. 

Sold.

I'm not a big miniatures fan, I've always been a huge Star Wars nerd. X-Wing is almost good enough to make me plunk down serious money on these ships.

I'm sure the game itself has a lot of strategy, maybe a bit of depth, but the way time flys by (git it?!) when you're wrapped up in this game blows my mind. We'll sit down for a simple dogfight and the next thing I know an hour and a half has passed. That would be fine, but I often feel like very little happened in that hour and a half. 

It's also alarming how large of an impact dice rolling has in this massively competitive game.

I have one core set, one of each up through wave three, and plan to add the Tantiv, rebel transport, and imperial aces expansions. That is pretty much it for me. I do enjoy the game greatly, and think it managed to condense the wings of war style into something better, but I am only so much of a star wars fan. FFG has plenty of my monies. I won't keep feeding them more over ships I don't recognize from books I didn't read or games I didn't play.

RATING: 8.5
Base Game: 8.
(Unofficial) Coop Mode: 9.
Average: 8.5.

Amazing theme, great basic gameplay, great toy factor, amazing variability and replayability. A game that rewards skill despite having a ton of different customizations available. Practice does make you better, there are very few games that actually do this. FUN!

So, what do I not like in the base game? One, the game comes in many small piecies. I don't mind the prices, but hunting for specific expansions to get what you want is not something I particularly enjoy. Two, it's a PvP miniatures game, which requires some commitment to the game from all players, and that reduces the ease of introduction quite a lot.

The custom coop mode of X-Wing is worthy of further notice. Heroes of the Aturi Cluster succesfully turns X-Wing from a PvP to a Coop, which is an amazing feat. Some aspects really need some reworking (level up system and player ship balance) but others like mission design, scaling and campaign design are spectacular. It's a 0.7 version as of Feb2016, so that explains it, but overall it's already an amazing system.

Awesome miniatures game.  Fully enjoyable even with a basic core set.  Game play is quick and intuitive.  Much easier to pick up than other rule heavy games.  It is also based much more on skill than other games.  I recommend this game to anyone wanting to get into war gaming.  The awesome star wars universe is just a plus.

RATING: 8
Like many miniature games, the core set is not great by itself, so plan on buying at least a few expansions. Money aside, this game is my ideal game. Its relatively easy to learn but very hard to master. This game also has a fair bit of RNG to add variety to each game. If you don't happen to like the game play mechanics, flying around detailed Star Wars models is pretty fun in itself. If you get into this game, you will find that you will be thinking up new squad lists in your free time,,, well at least I do. 

As a side note, I would recommend Scum as your first faction as the upgrades used in most good scum lists are relatively self-contained in Scum expansions as opposed to Rebels or Imperials, whose sought upgrades are strewn throughout many a faction.

Wanting to play with the wife and adult kids.  Our son's first Movie was the original Star Wars film, so I think we all love the genre so much that little things that bother others wont bother us.  Also, I tend to love games that are either 'love it or hate it' types.  So far, I'm more a collector than a player, with just some solo play to learn it.  Hoping to teach to my daughter and her boy friend soon.  There are some mechanics that are reminiscent of other aviation games, like moving from lowest level skill to highest and shooting from highest to lowest is the same as Check Your Six.

20$ to anyone who can play a whole round of this game without making some Star Wars reference, or sound effect. Anyone?... That's what I thought... It's impossible. The theme in this beauty shines through magnificently. I could really see in my minds eye: Luke Skywalker finishing a tight loop in Red 5, slipping in behind Darth Vader and bombarding him with laser fire. What a great game, highs and lows, narrow escapes, special upgrades. I love it. The Star Wars theme works excellent. Lived up to my excitement for it.

The mechanics are better than Wings of War/Glory. They are more intuitive. The game plays fast and it is a lot of fun. The regular version (which is the actual game) is easy to explain to 8 year old kids. The game comes with introductory rules but I don't see using them since the regular game is rather intuitive. The spaceships are extremely well done and just for them you will be satisfied with spending your money on this game. The advanced version, where you add droids and other equipment in your ships, adds quite a bit of strategy, which I am not sure if it is necessary. The regular game rocks on its own. Just put the star wars music, and this game reaches a new level of excitement! Great job from Fantasy Flight!

RATING: 7
I love miniature war games, like Warhammer, but I really don't have the time to assemble and paint my army. X-Wing comes with pre-assembled and pre-painted miniatures and is Star Wars themed. 

The game is easy and quick to teach, set-up and play. You do need to help newer players with making their forces, though. I usually solve this by asking them what they want to play, and I'll make their list for them. Some players prefer to look over all the cards and make their own list. Let them do that if they want, but that does mean they can get overwhelmed before the game even starts. 

I've got enough (though, certainly not a lot) of miniatures for Empire and the Rebels to play with a couple of different setups. I'll sporadically buy a new ship if it looks cool, but I'm not actively pursuing new purchases.

I'm a wargamer and I own a lot of this. The base game is an excellent theme with excellent fundamental mechanics. A great movement system with exciting choices. Really delivers the feeling of flying in a dogfight.

Expansion bloat, combined with the combo nature of FFG's upgrade system makes this game difficult to understand and fundamentally less enjoyable. The presence of turrets  (ships that shoot 360 degrees) heavily mitigate the reward for skilful flying and thus the charm of the game.  The number of component's in this game effectively makes this a 90-120 time commitment for what feels like it should be a 45 minute game.

Great system badly in need of a reboot and some simplification.

RATING: 9
Absolutely brilliant game. The game that got me into a genre I didn't think I'd ever enjoy; miniatures games (I tried warhammer 40k and hated everything about it). At it's heart x-wing was simple, elegant and had a surprising amount of tactical depth. 

It's a shame that the tournament version of the game has shaped the game as a whole as simple dogfights are by far the most boring way of playing the game. I think FFG have released too many pointless new ships and cards. It's become over-complicated and fiddly. A lot of the rules are on cards and FAQs. I had a look at the latest FAQ and it shows what a bloated monster the game has become. They've turned a lithe Han Solo of a game into a corpulent Jabba the Hutt! The simple order of a turn has been split into sub phases. It's all a master class in his to ruin a game through unnecessary tinkering. Thankfully the bloat can all be ignored and the game enjoyed in its original form in so-called 'casual' play. I think it would be good if FFG released more scenarios and campaigns and fewer ships and cards.

I still enjoy flying the classic Star Wars fighters against each other, and missions are really good way to enjoy the tactical positioning aspects of the game. I'll have to try out Heroes of the Aturi Cluster for a co-op campaign game soon.

I really liked this game.  It is definitely something that needs pretty immediate expansion as it is a better game with more pieces as you need to put more thought into which action you are going to use and take every round.  With the base game, it kind of just runs into, 'ok, aim fire, miss, ok, turn, aim , fire, maybe a hit, ok, turn'  like a chase game.  As you become familiar with it, it is much better to use the point to 'buy' your fleet.  It is also really fun to do the scenarios.  The expansions are really excellent and fun.  Overall, a great game, but needs expansions fast.

I own 2 of this set for the 6 minis which cost a lot more as single expansions. I purchased 19 other expansion sets as follows:

Tie Advanced (3)
Millennium Falcon
Slave I
A-Wing (4)
Tie Interceptor (4)

I purchased a 3' x 3' felt space pad to play on, and plan to purchase all the upcoming expansions for this fantastic minis game!

Having played my first game, a huge DeathStar Trench scenario at ConnCON in Stamford 2013, now I'm psyched!!! I want to play this as much as HeroScape, and can't wait for more minis!!! Nice bits!

WHile I have played other games like this in the past, the 2 player variant in the starter box will leave you wanting more and was lacking tactics and just hoping for the right die.

Fwoosh! Excellent. Great that FFG include some 'quick-start' rules, but oddly, it's one the few games of theirs that actually need them. Press on and play the full rules, there's not a lot to get your head round with the core set. We bought 2 core sets to give us more ships which works out a lot cheaper than buying expansions, though you don't get the unique pilots but at least it bolsters your numbers before adding some more esoteric fighters.

Fantastic miniatures, terrific theme and very high production values.  The system is a bit clunky in my opinion though.  It covers everything but all seems to be bolted together and the rivets are showing.  Only played 4-5 times but I struggle to see the elegance in this system.

Initially I thought it was just that I needed more minis so I bought another base set, the millennium falcon, etc and tried again.  No passion.  No feel.

As someone else says if this wasn't Star Wars then no-one would play.

Hmmm - revisited after a long break.  Played a couple of multiplayer games with my kids and a few friends.  Had a ball and a lot of laughs. A bit beer and pretzelly but fine for what it is.  The cards and special abilities make it great.  Not sure I would play seriously as it is a bit gimmicky but like I said - great fun for kids and friends.

The smartest miniature game around. Since it's ships with momentum and vidibility arcs, the heavy reliance on terrain of other games is instantly removed. That saves a lot of trouble on many levels. Plus everything you need for a game easily fits in a backpack!

Solid game, a few mechanics that separate it from Wings of War (now wings of glory).

The movement dial is the best innovative aspect.

The miniature quality is good 7/10 (10/10 compared to Wizards of the Coast minis). A tad bit fragile though.

FFG's card and counter quality is A+ as usual.

Lacks replay value but may change with new releases. 

Overall enjoyable, recommend for hardcore and casual gamers. Simple enough for young kids as well.

Rebels are a bit over powered. 

Worth the price.

I did not have high expectations for this game, as I did not like my one play of Wings Of War much. But I reallt enjoyed my first two plays of it, and so did my friends and 10-year old son. The game feels pretty streamlined, is easy to teach (especially considering that it is a tabletop game) and highly customizable with amazing looking spaceships. The miniatures really look the part! Be sure to buy at least two additional ships (I got another X-Wing and the Advanced Tie-Fighter) and play one of the missions at the back of the book. That way, you can also easily play this game with four players.

X-Wing is a fast, fun and exciting game of ship to ship combat in the Star Wars universe.
The fact that you can play so many different ships from the franchise also means that game play will never get old and that they will continue to rake in the money as we purchase new ships.

Good quality miniatures with decent paint job for your money. The game itself is a simple flight-path game in the tradition of Wings of Whatnot. Plays faster than many of its predecessors (still takes quite a while) yet offers amiable range of choices and tactics. A must for Star Wars space combat fans and worth a try for almost anyone old enough not to swallow the ships.

Simple but with hidden depths (a bit like me..) this skirmish-cum-strategy minis game has a lot of potential. Absolutely requires the right blend of forces (and the TIEs seem a bit overpowered using just the core set) but a fine start to what I hope to be a long-running series.
Revision, 09/02/15: With expansions, the game opens up into something quite spectacular. I've updated the score from 7 (core game) to 9 (core game + expansions) as mechanically it's good anyway, but the expansions not only add buffs and models, they also improve the mechanics (large ship sizes, Modifications, Boosts, Ion rule tweaks, cloaking... the list is almost endless). An indispensable game!

1st update (Oct 2013)[9.5]: I love this game very much. It's so simple and easy to teach, the theme appeals to a very broad audience and it can be a very nailbiting experience. The only negative aspect is the cost. Despite my love of the game I've been considering selling my collection, because I cannot see an where the spending should end.

Still a fantastic game!

The game system is a 6, the miniatures make it a 7!
... but beware of collectible nature of it, it gets expensive fast.

[+] game system is easy, gameplay is smooth, squadron building can be fun (with enough expensions to choose from), miniatures are gorgeous, love the theme
[-] must buy expensions to make it worth, expensive! 

Note: there is a point where 1 squadron is doomed, game should end there (at players discretion) and never drag on till the last ship is down.

UP: I recently discovered the co-op/solo campaign "Heroes of the Aturi Cluster" (developped by fans), it has rules for AI imperial ships that are pretty smart. The campaign requires a lot of ships to be enjoyed entirely, but with few ships you can still play a few scenarios. There's a lot to print & assemble for full effect, it's obvious that a lot of work was put into that and it seem to work well. There's an experience system and "levelling" up your pilot between missions, very cool overall, I recommand checking it up (download available from FFG)

Really enjoy the game, but it's hard to say what I really feel without first getting more out of it with different ships and playing from both sides. We'll see: I just ordered an A-Wing and a TIE Interceptor to open things up.  9.1 to a 9.2 After playing a few games with the Slave 1.(12/27/13)
So a year later, what do I think? Just good old fashioned fun. It's like being a kid again, and the excitement of playing with the coolest toys with your best friends. The theme of dog-fighting and Star Wars melded with (unique) dice rolling and expandable fleets and upgradable ships and the sequencing of abilities and the unpredictable chaos of movement, angles, and arcs makes for some great times. Would this be as good and re-playable without expansions? Maybe not, but is this something you'd ever want to not keep growing?

After one game feels like a Wings of War Light. The theme is interesting, but the collective aspect is not necessarily my thing right now.

I don't know how much fun there will be in the long run using the basic fighters and how fast the game will be with several fighters on each side.

Update after second game, now with multiple ships and 70 points. Two hours to solve the fight of 5 ships was way too much. It will probably get faster with experience, but it still feels quite doubtful especially, when the game feels quite luck heavy.

I'm happy to play again, but I'm not convinced yet. :)

Okay, long comment because I think this is a really good game but I want to clearly explain why I don't rate it higher. The game pretty much feels like this to me: spend 10 mins maneuvering. Either I've outmaneuvered my opponent (yes!) or I've been outmaneuvered (no!). At which point a perfectly-lined-up perfectly-timed shot is taken....which probably does nothing. Or even if it does something, it might remove a damage or a hull point, which is pretty much nothing.

10 more mins of maneuver for the same result.

Then 10 more mins of maneuver for the same result.

Etc.

OR

Everyone flies into a big cluster in the middle, people crash/collide, fire is concentrated, etc. and tons of stuff dies. Now either one player has an overwhelming advantage so the game might as well be over, or both players have just a small force left so begin the 10-mins-of-maneuver-for-that-one-perfectly-timed-shot cycle and repeat for the next hour.

So that's the part that just isn't my cup of tea. I totally get that many people would love the constant maneuvering, and I'm happy they love the game. But I think maybe my background of chess and Warhammer Fantasy has me disliking that. In both of those games, maneuvering happens at the beginning. You arrive at a position that you have carefully planned and worked for, and then the crap hits the fan and you find out which player's ideas were stronger and more well-thought-out. With X-Wing it feels like the planning and maneuvering is often pointless because outmaneuvering an opponent several times a game only to come up empty on the dice was pretty common. And I LOVE dice. I love randomness and chance in my games, just not the way it comes out in X-Wing. Also, how many times in the movies does a pilot outmaneuver another pilot, get behind him, get off that perfect shot, and then not destroy the enemy fighter? It seemed not only anti-climactic but anti-thematic as well. Still a beautiful game though, without a doubt.

Possibly this could all be solved by somehow eliminating defense dice.

Very very boring game. Similar to Wings of Glory, but simpler and less satisfying. Wings of Glory languishes down at 500-something in the BGG rankings and this doesn't... Because Star Wars.

Star Wars are great popcorn films, but they don't compete with the First and Second World Wars, which were tragic, moving and important. Go read some history and play something that celebrates the courage of people who fought, suffered and died in their millions fighting Hitler. 

Other problems with this game compared to Wings of Glory. In Wings of Glory, you can buy four planes and have a good game. Star Wars X-Wing is a license to print money by FFG. I played the core set with three ships and it's not a complete game. You have to buy other ships, which no one else seems to mind. Because Star Wars.

It's too luck-based with the dice rolling so, even when you get near the other ships, you'll probably miss. Oh yes, and for what is basically a casual skirmish game, X-Wing has FAR too much deckbuilding. Before you can miss a shot, you'll be choosing pilots, ships, blah blah. This is because the game supports a tournament scene, which Wings of Glory doesn't. Because Star Wars.

If you're considering this game and aren't a Star Wars fan, I'd recommend picking up four planes for Wings of Glory. It's cheaper, the planes look really nice, and you can teach your kids some history. The difficulty of Wings can be customised too - you can play as an easy skirmish, or you can add pilots, height changes, etc. Even better, there's no dice rolling so the game ends quickly. Get into firing range of another plane and they take a random damage counter. Destroy two of four planes and the game ends.

An okay game.  A light year better that Starship Miniatures Battles that WotC put out.  However, in the end this game never really feels "fun" when I play it.  I love Star Wars and want to collect all the miniatures though.  In the end I'll probably use the miniatures with the West End Games Star Wars: Star Warriors rules, or integrate with the Fantasy Flight Star Wars role playing game.  Just never feels "fun" on its own.

X-Wing is a beautiful game, with great minis and a nice movement mechanic. The problem with it is that, if you buy the core set you can't have a nice game to start, you have to buy other ships to make it a great game, and that's just sad.

Wings of War was a great game. Dogfighting is fascinating anyway, but those gorgeous bi-plane models absolutely fired my imagination. When Fantasy flight announced that they were converting it to Star Wars, I nearly exploded from the excitement. They delivered too. Nearly everything they have added to the Wings of War game system has improved it. Dice combat is always more fun than drawing cards and having unique pilots, equipment and other modifications to customize your squadron have really opened up the game space in every way.

Worthy of it's own place among my other tactical flying games. Fantastic figures and relatively fast play make the game appealing. It's not WoW and it's not A20 mechanics but shares some similarities with both. Good stuff, especially if you like Star Wars.

An elegant little dogfighting game that's evolved (by FFG's 'living card/minis game' model) into something a little more top-heavy. Competitive play is very pricey, but $100 buys a core set and a handful of expansions -- enough to give you months of superb tactical minis combat. It's unquestionably worth it: between the exquisite core design and the bliss of flying iconic Star Wars ships ('pew pew pew!!' sounds not included), X-WING is a stone classic. Enthusiastically, unreservedly recommended to anyone who ever dreamt of beating Han Solo's time on the Kessel Run.

I do have many additional ships for the game, but there really is no need to list them all here.

Here's the deal: this game is excellent.  It is tactical, fun, exciting and challenging.  If you are a Star Wars fan, it is a no-brainer.  The one thing that scared me off of this game for years was that I thought it was going to be a money sink.  If you are going to play casually, it definitely does NOT have to be a game that you drop a lot of cash into.  It is visually beautiful and worth checking out.  

EDIT (February, 2017): I wrote the above comments prior to getting involved in the competitive scene, and I do believe those comments still hold true.  I didn't like the competitive aspect as much as I thought I would, but I still love this game and will happily join in on a tournament once in a while.

I think X-Wing is a great "lite" skirmish game.  The game moves quickly and stays tense thanks to the way players lock-in ship movements in secret, creating a delightful second-guessing element.  The dice do just the right thing here: creating tension but not being so random as to completely spoil good strategy.

The squad-building is where the game really shines, opening up customization and many additional features and tactics.

I enjoy that the game is superbly simple to teach, quick and exciting to play, yet manages to offer variety and depth enough that will keep it fresh for a long time.

Oh...and the models are incredibly gorgeous...

[i]X-Wing Miniatures[/i] improves on the Wings of War system in places, but every positive change seems to be balanced out by a negative.

Why X-Wing is better than WoW: cardboard movement templates, a theme that many gamers know and love, an updated critical hit system, it's fun to roll dice.

Why X-Wing is worse than WoW: insta-death (= bad die rolls), player downtime in large battles, an underwhelming base set, price point.

It was easy to remedy the instant kill in WoW, since all you had to do was remove the pilot death card.  There's no such option in X-Wing, since dice govern all damage.  So after 20-40 minutes of set-up players can be knocked out immediately if they don't roll well on defense.  That sucks, especially when there are 90 minutes remaining in the game for everyone else.

The initiative system adds flavor and strategy to the gameplay, but it also adds a ton of downtime when more than a few players are involved.  That's enough to kill my interest in X-Wing right there.

Lastly, to hammer on the value issue, X-Wing is WAY overpriced given that no one in their right mind would be content with the pitiful number of models included in the base set.  So fans of the game are dropping $75+ if they're dropping anything at all.  That's acceptable for obsessive fans and most miniatures gamers, but anyone who doesn't fall into either category (like me) is bound to flinch.

Am a euro gamer by heart and miniature game dont interest me at all and plus am not the biggest star wars fan in the world, but i give it a go to see what all the fuss was about. the first thing i did was look at this as just a game and i was very shocked how much fun it is and the wife likes it to which is a bonus. The next day i got some expansion pack so be aware u buy it and want more.

Definitely a big step forward in miniature-gaming.  The play is quick and easy, yet it still manages to really EMBRACES the theme.  Above all, it feels so much like those old 'X-Wing' and 'TIE Fighter' games from LucasArts, it's like an explosion of nostalgia wrapped in a irresistible theme that is combined with perfect execution!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
This is an easy but great game. In the footsteps of Wings of War, but with a better pace and tons of possibilities. Expansion packs add welcome variants to the gameplay, because the base kit - even though interesting - can only go so far. Buying them can be a bit expensive and it is wise to share resources with regular opponents. Game length is proportional to the number of miniatures in play.
Lady Luck (dice) has an important role to play but the game highlights the maneuvering abilities of the players nonetheless.

X-Wing does an amazing job of capturing the feel of epic, small scale dogfights.  I love the simplicity of the rules, and the minis, oh the god the minis!  It's like I'm 9 years old all over again.

I don't know if it's mostly because of the theme but I enjoyed this much more than Wings of War. 

The movement is handled well by the dial, and I liked the red/green mechanism. The combat dice are cool too since there are a couple layers to it. 

The action system is nice but we took focus 90% of the time which led to a good amount of null combat. I don't think this is a flaw in the system as much as me not using the locking action as an X-wing. So I think I'd just have to play a bit more and determine the situational use of each.

We did have a bit of circling for a while, with a lot of misses/evades due to the focus action. Like I said, it's probably because we're both relatively new to the game but I'd like it more if it sped up a bit. I'd also like to see a fight with a few different units on each side but that would get expensive very quickly.

I have played this game a few times now and it's a blast to play. Having a squadron of ships at your command and the tactical nature of the gameplay is very enjoyable. The game itself is very easy to understand and isn't overly rules-complex. It also looks amazing when you have it all set up...

The only real knock that I have against it is the fact that you really do need to buy quite a few ships to make it worth your while. At one time I thought that I'd like to get at least two of all the ships but have since settled on getting one of all of the original trilogy ships instead.

For something that's as entertaining as this is, it really should get to the table more than it has. The last time I played my set was at the end of 2013, and the last time I played it at all was at GenCon 2014. It would be nice to break this out sometime soon.

The mechanics of the game are great: Flying around, programming your movement, using cards to power up your ship. The issue is that the base game provides three ships. It just feels lackluster from the base game. Costs too much money to add even 1 more ship.

I'm extremely excited about and proud of X-Wing. It was incredibly awesome to be involved with such an amazing property and tackle a dynamic, memorable part of the action. Even as a starry-eyed kid with daydreams of becoming a game designer, I never dreamt that one day I'd be designing a Star Wars game!

This is fun.  Simultaneous action selection in a wargame is new to me... but it makes each turn really interesting as you try to jockey for position against your opponent.  Of course... its all for nothing if the dice don't cooperate so that helps keep things light and fast.  Its also addicting to buy those little expansion packs for a few more cards and ship options to update your squads.  I'm looking forward to exploring this further!

I have to admit that the components are gorgeous  (I am not fan of Star Wars), the rules are easy to grasp and it is very enjoyable, However, X wing has too many rules  and exceptions for my taste, you spend a lot of time learning how to play your squad and learn from others. As mid-heavy gamer i prefer to spend time trying other games than deepening in a non-priority game. Too expensive and collectible are my principal cons. And I have too many games with direct conflict.

Nice variation of Wings of War. Real selling points are original(and expanded) Star Wars universe, really great looking ships (the pre-painted miniatures are top-notch). FFG captured the magic of original SW. I might like more the non-dice approach of WoW, but all the stuff that X-Wing adds feel really appropriate to Star Wars feel. I can't really complain.

Huge ships finally snapped my spine and I started to collect this game.

edit: I'm probably not going to buy anything from Scum & Villainy faction. Its introduction left me cold. The magic of x-wing for me is the rebel vs imperium conflict. I'm hoping that they will release more huge ships in the future.

After a couple of years cautiously observing from a safe distance, we finally took the plunge and grabbed a starter box plus a few extra ships. Haven't played it much yet. Not sure whether it will grab us or not. 

Prepainted miniatures games like X-Wing suffer from 'neither one thing nor t'other' as far as I'm concerned. They're too expensive compared to boardgames (because you don't get everything you need in one box), yet they're not as rewarding as 'proper' miniatures games (for which painting, making scenery, etc., forms a large part of the enjoyment). Still, we'll see...

Movement and manoeuvres is really something in this one. In my first big game I crashed into my own ships very often and could not hold formation. I need a lot more practice. There is a lot of luck from the dies but it mitigates over the course of a game. The ships don't go down easily, there's a lot of attrition battling going on. This could be due to our inexperience though. 

It's very fun to field different squads and to test out different strategies. Overall I think this is a great game.

I love this game. It isa great 2-player, semi-casual game of tactics and dog fighting, with the coolest space theme out there for ships shooting ships. I play this with a few friends, and they all love it, and a few opponents is all i need to continue enjoying this. I used to play MtG, and this satisfies my collection disorder, and allows for others to play my collection, which is more manageable, and affordable than an MtG collection.

Rating used to be much higher... until I got sick of it.

Dogfighting gets old rather quickly (to me), new expansions only brings up new permutations to rather a convoluted system as it stands right now, lack of faction identity, reliance on luck (or mitigation) spoils the competitive scene and due to its popularity the community grew a bit toxic.

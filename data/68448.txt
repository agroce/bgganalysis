I like the central drafting mechanic, and the tech tree that exists over the three phases, but something about the game has never really resonated with me (I prefer Sushi-Go, and I think it's because 7W takes too long for what I get and the strategy in terms of defensive drafting doesn't shine nearly as much here).

At the very least: The best board game I played in 2010. Currently my favourite board game.

This game takes civilization building to a whole new level and plays in 30 minutes no matter how many people are playing (from 2 to 7).

Players only directly interact with their immediate neighbours and everyone selects and plays cards all at once. These two mechanics keep the game very fast-paced and fun!

Players can also choose different paths to victory: You can go military and try to beat up on your neighbours, go for science and try to get massive points in the final turns, go for wonders for unique benefits... so much more. No two games will be exactly the same. The same strategy will not always work.

The only thing I dislike about this game is the make-shift two-player variant, but the box does not even advertise that it can be played with two players so I'm fine with it.

Quick fun card drafting game with amazing artwork and a cool theme. Multiple ways to earn points lends itself to replayability. Initially disliked it because I was expecting to game to have more of a civ building feel but once I figured out that the game wasn't trying to be that it became great.

I admit this one is growing on me. I wasn't sure what to think of it the first dozen or so times we played it. I guess I expected more than a card game - more chits, more stuff to move. But there are a lot of things to like here. The downtime is zero; everyone plays at the same time. This also means the game can scale between 2 players and 7-8 players easily without increasing the game time much, if at all. Also, the game does not outstay its welcome. It never lasts longer than 30-45 minutes, which allows you to play through multiple games in an evening.

We introduced the Leaders expansion recently and think it is a great addition to the base game.

6-1-14: Bumped it up to an 8. Easy to teach, quick to play, and scales up very well from 2 to 7 players.

10-3-14: 18 months ago when we first bought this game, I rated it as a 7. After playing it a few more times, I bumped it up to a 7.5. Then after a few more plays, bumped it to an 8. Then an 8.5. And now I've increased the rating to a 9. I can't think of another game I've increased its rating after playing it so many times. I've played lots of 2, 3 and 4 players games, as well as a few with 6 or 7. When everyone has had a few plays under their belt this is a very competitive, tight game.

7-13-16: Bumped to a 10. This is one of my favorite games.

This really needs more plays. It is rather easy to learn and plays quite fast as well. But we have most often played it two (the play count is quite off), and while we actually like the dummy player, it gets a bit old. We have played it with more once or twice, and we enjoyed it quite a bit more.

But now we don't want to bring it to the table when it is just the two of us, and we have more interesting games for 4p+.

Card-drafting civilization building that scales very well and plays quickly.

I can see why people love this game; it plays quick, it has replayability, and it can accomodate 2-7 players (!), plus the theme "fits".  I'm not sure it has much in the way of strategy or control, but again because of the short playtime this is tolerable I guess (any game with card-drafting as the central mechanic seems tactical at best).

Setup/space is a bit of a pain in the ass, considering its a quick card game, so you almost have to have a big table and play several games back-to-back for it to be worth it.  2-player is a bit annoying for this very reason(s); that said, the "dummy" mechanic, which I usually do not enjoy at all, is implemented pretty well.  The cost and box-size/shelf-space is a bit absurd, when you compare it to say, oh Dominion.  This game also seems very expandable, and the Leaders expansion seems to be a must buy for me.  And oh, this is really a very very simple game to jump in and play, despite what the simpleton SdJ jury voters might lead you to believe.

Own the [boardgame=92539]Leaders[/boardgame], [boardgame=111661]Cities[/boardgame], [boardgame=154638]Babel[/boardgame] and [boardgame=133993]Wonder Pack[/boardgame] expansions, as well as the [boardgame=110308]Catan[/boardgame], [boardgame=83445]Manneken Pis[/boardgame], [boardgame=99315]Stevie[/boardgame], [boardgame=127838]Louis[/boardgame], [boardgame=156119]Wil[/boardgame], [boardgame=166329]Nimrod[/boardgame], [boardgame=231167]Leaders Anniversary pack[/boardgame] and [boardgame=231168]Cities Anniversary pack[/boardgame] promos.  This expansion (Leaders) adds another round of drafting, which leaves you with a hand of 4 leaders, 3 of which can be played during the course of the game.  The leaders allow for specialization/ways to score points/quick money etc., and add to the gameplay.  Really a simple addition and a must-have expansion for fans of 7 Wonders.

Highly competetive card game with simple rules but complex strategy. Rarely used draft mechanics allows for a lot of player interaction. Randomness vs. skill is well balanced.  Definitely many skill levels exist.

Plays fast (7-14 minutes online, 25-40 minutes in real life), with simple set up and clean up. Strategy and experience depends on number of players (personally prefer 2-4 players).

Still feels fun and fresh after 5000 games.

Amazing art on the cards. Highly recommend sleeving cards due to barely acceptable durability.

A masterpiece.

I like 7 Wonders more every time I play it. At our last play, we finished a quick three-player game and immediately turned around to play again. I love games that hit that under half hour mark and still leave you hungry to try to improve on your previous performance. 

It offers more flexibility beyond Sushi Go and is kind of like a +1 step to it, though some people in my game group seem to think that it's wildly more complicated. It's really not, but perhaps I overcomplicate it when I explain it -- need to work on that. 

It's nice that it plays 3-7 players, though -- we are always on the lookout for games that are good at 5, 6, or even 7 players.

7 Wonders is really close to my ideal light game. It takes a while to explain (for newbs, I prefer [thing=192291][/thing]), but when you sit down with people who know how to play, no other game plays so smoothly, accommodates such a flexible player count, and providers such a satisfying experience. One of my favorites.

RATING: 10
One of my favorite newer strategy games.  

For me, the elements of a great strategy game include: 

(1) More skill-based than luck-based,
(2) Winning strategies change with circumstances,
(3) Straightforward / simple set-up, 
(4) Balanced gameplay,
(5) Does not drag on after one side has a decisive advantage, 
(6) Entertaining theme

7 Wonders scores high on all of these attributes.  There is a slight learning curve in 7 Wonders and it might take a round before the rules become clear to new players, but once everyone knows the rules, it's a a simple game that can be played in about 30 - 45 minutes, while also packing in a lot of strategy.

I enjoy this game immensely, however it disturbs me that people can play in error (or CHEAT!) without causing any sort of disturbance. I don't care for games like that for some reason. I don't play with people who cheat, but it's impossible to detect with an error is made by another player.

I also don't object to the "misprint" of the Military cards, and consider the brouhaha a bit misguided nitpicking... but this is my opinion.

A big beautiful game that is right in the Euro game wheel house.  It's simple and it exploits modern tastes in drafting and card combos so it's no suprise it's popular.  But it's not any better than Ticket to Ride, Carcassonne, or Settlers of Catan and it doesn't do anything that Race for the Galaxy or Fairy Tale don't already do.  I have no need of it, but I'll play someone else's copy.  I'm repulsed by the publishing company's use of hard to acquire promotional items to sell the game.

I tried hard to like 7 wonders, and it's ok, but not great, imho.  

For me the issue is that I feel like I would need pretty detailed knowledge about the cards to able to access its strategic depth. 

You buy your resources and economy stuff in Ages 1 and 2, while you're going to score a big chunk of your victory points from cars bought in Age 3. Obviously you can't see the Age 3 cards in ages 1 and 2, so unless you've memorised how much they're going to cost, all of your resource purchasing just feels like guesswork to me.

I'm fine for games to have a learning curve, but I want to feel like I can at least _access_ the puzzle within my first few plays, even if I need more practice to solve it or beat experienced players. I've played probably 10 times now and I still mostly feel like I'm making educated guesses in Ages 1 and 2, and then being constrained by those guesses in Age 3.

In terms of positives, 7 wonders is good to have around because it's so flexible in terms of player count, it has cool art, it's quick to play and it's a plausible option for non-gamers (as long as you have time for two games, and assure them that by the second game they will understand).

Sushi Go Party, however, checks all of these boxes as well. Having recently acquired SGP it remains to be seen how often 7W will come off the shelf now....

LIKE: The card draft is fun and the table talk when someone passes you a great card, or pointing out someone has an edge. Fun and relatively quick, great game. (We usually play with expansions.) I enjoy the small amount of engine building.

DISLIKE: Shallow theme and the strategy is not deep either. Cards are iconified, so looking up what effect every card does is a drag.

OVERALL: Fun game. Great for larger groups. Not sure if the leaders expansion is necessary as it adds to game length.

RATING: 7
3 plays in a row in the first outing. I've now played with 3, 4, 5 and 6 players. Initially, we were all very confused about the game (and none of us are slouches at gamin') having no idea on strategy. It's clear the first game will end with many cards unable to be played or not helpful at all - e.g. learning that new resources really *can't* be added by the third age is extremely important. Combination are really confusing at first. You have to keep in mind several things: your resources, your neighbors resources, cards that produce other cards, and then evaluate each card based on cost - i.e. can you pay for it with your own resources or do you have to buy from a neighbor? Do you take this opportunity to build your Wonder? There are many variables - it results in a bit of AP as you trim the possible cards down to the few that produce sufficient benefit for the cost.

Given all this, I don't think this is a gateway game at all - it's more a filler for gamers. Speed of play is definitely a huge bonus here since you can dismiss the first game as a learning experience and give it another go without pause.

One key we discovered was using the included scoring pad. It's *far* easier to score everyone card type by card type - with one person recording the values for each: "Ok. What did you get for purple cards?" I'll be sure to do this from now on.

In the end, this game is fine and certainly fits a niche - those times you're waiting for others to arrive or filling time between things. But is it a game I'm anxious to play? Not really. It isn't terribly interesting.

7 Wonders didn't stand the test of time since it has become a little monotonous. I'd like to see more variance from game to game. It's still a good game but there are times I do not fancy it.

7 Wonders satisfies one of the most primitive human needs, that is accomplishing something. In every game you can see the progress you make right in front of your own eyes. You may miss a turn or two but your achievements last. On the first plays this is what gets you hooked. 

A few plays later you start to worry about your neighbours, and yet another layer of the game unfolds. Now you are not only trying to play your own game but also hinder your opponents'. This is what satisfies gamers' needs. Every turn you are facing trade offs between the best card for you and the best card for the next player.

However, just like I wrote before, it does not take too long until you have been in almost every conceivable situation and the game becomes a bit repetitive. Your decisions become obvious and the game reduces closer to what it was on the first plays, i.e., the satisfaction comes from building the civilisation not from competition.

I also have to say that the resource mechanics and especially how you pay for the cards is rather counter intuitive. New players have needed quite a bit of explaining and some practical examples to learn how the game plays. Personally I do not like teaching 7 Wonders.

Awesome game! Can't wait to play again. Recieved as gift.

I really do love this game. It's fast, light, easy to teach. I love that there are multiple paths to victory. You can't just focus on one and expect to win. Also nice is that while you can play a military strategy, it is not overwhelming and a player can completely ignore it and still win the game.

I think 7 Wonders is very well balanced, and great fun for large and small groups.

Had originally rated this an 8 but dropped it down to a 7 after several plays. I can't but help feel that once you know how to play, it becomes quite luck driven as to whether you can draft the required cards. Still quite fun though. Is a much better game with 3 or 4 as you see cards mutliple times and the luck factor reduces from players who you have no influence over.

A classical "gateway" game, though a bit more advanced than other.

It can be easily taken in a small bag in vacation.

Dry and only one among many for me. And I hate cards being placed under each other so I cant see temple or market or laboratory - game just tells me not to care about theme and meaning of my actions. This is fully subjective but there's no fun to me in a game where I'm told I'm building something while I just collecting vp's. And mechanic by itself is not fascinating enough to make me forget all mentioned earlier.

Light and quick-paced game that still offers a bit of richness and strategy when there just isn't time for something more complex.  That said, all of the iconography can be hard for new players to pick up right away.  

The 2-player variant is actually quite good for enhancing the strategic aspects of the game through skillful use of the free city.

Fun game. The real strength of this game is in it's short length, relatively easy rules, and ability to accommodate 7. The depth is limited and more about reacting to what's going around on the table around you than building any long term strategy.

RATING: 8
I really like this game. It plays really fast, doesn't need too much explanation, but has some difficult decisions in it. It's not a 'complex' game though. There's a bit of player interaction with the military cards, which I like. The best thing in this game are the many ways you can win. You have to adapt your strategy to the ones that your opponents play and it's also depending on the cards you get.

In short:
• not too long or complex
• many ways to win
• great artwork/card design

Fun drafting, easy for beginners, needs to come with symbols cheat sheer for up to seven players. Passing around the rule book and the one reference sheet in a large game impedes game-play. 

Expansions are a necessary supplement as the base game drags after a while.

RATING: 7.7
The first couple of games seemed random, but once you're familiar with the cards you'll find you can have a strategy and you'll start to see many risk vs reward choices. If you pay attention you can start predicting what others will do and what cards you're likely to be passed. It's also very large group friendly. Great game.

RATING: 9
A classic civilization building game that scales elegantly and will take just as long to play at 3 or 7 players (though 5 is probably optimal). This was one of the first modern games I got into with a card drafting mechanic and tableau building mechanic. It has withstood the test of time and will likely be a staple in my game library for many years to come. The only drawbacks in my opinion are that the iconography can present a steep learning curve for new players and since you can only directly influence the play of those to your immediate left and right, certain people in the right position in the turn can benefit wildly from being next to novice players and others just the opposite by being next to experienced ones.

Wonderful skilful game at 3, possibly 4 players.  Random luck fest at higher numbers that relies far too much on what board you happen to get and how your neighbours play.

I find it best with 3.  Larger tables mean that unless everyone is of similar skill you can't stop someone from winning.

I don't get what all the fuss is about, it takes ages to explain it to new players and with it going up to 7 there is likely someone who doesn;t know it, and then your strategy is entirely dependant on what your neighbours give you/are dealt (it's possible all the cards you want end up in the same batch). It works okay I guess, the luck isn't too bad but it just doesn't have any depth to want to play it again and it doesn't work as a filler because people over think it too much or are new and have 30 minutes of rules.

7 Wonders is a perfect filler game. It scales well from 3-7 players and can be played in quite a short time period. There is really no down-time as action-chosing is simultanously. The different wonders lead you slightly into a certain direction, but the fact who is your neighbor and which cards come up determines pretty much your strategy. 7 Wonders is a family friendly game, which I enjoy playing from time to time.

Rating after one play, but I really enjoyed it. We felt completely lost for most of the game, but it has a nice mechanic, and worked very well as a 5 player game. I can see this one coming out a lot.

Update - we've since played it several more times, and this is going to be a common game for us, I can tell. Everyone likes that it plays quickly, and there are some nice decisions without being too much of a brain burner.

Yeah, early impressions were good, but I think this is one that will really shine with repeated plays, and my group just doesn't love it enough to play it a lot.

It's also fast and scales up to 7 (8 with expansion) without any significant increase in playing time. I do find with more players the cards you get tend to suck more and you're somewhat at the mercy of your neighbours, but still, great game. My friends definitely love it.

As I play more games I am slowly realizing that drafting cards (and building decks for that matter) are not my preferred game mechanisms.

In this game one has to continually examine cards, keep one, and pass along the others until everyone has kept a certain amount of cards. Then points are tallied up based on the cards drafted as they fall into "families" (military, science, etc.).

There is a bit of a leaching aspect of your neighbour's cards which I liked.

Familiarity with the type of cards in the game and their function is needed to succeed. 

Its simplicity is its brilliance but it's simply not something I want to play over and over.

Euro to the core.  It is an optimization exercise that is prevalent in the genre.  You are trying balance a whole lot of doo-hickies:  some give you instant gratification (victory points) while others get you nothing now, but may get you more future gratification (bigger victory points).  Some doo-hickies in combination won't score you VPs until the end of the game, while others keep you from losing VPs during the course of the game.  If you overload in one area, you lose, so you have to balance and optimize.  (I asked on more than one occasion, "Are you SURE Knizia didn't design this?")  It's a common mechanic, but by selecting a card to play from a hand of cards and passing the rest around can keep cards out of the hands of those who may benefit more from them.  It is like [thing=13823][/thing] with more doo-hickies and a [thing=12][/thing]-like scoring system.

If you flip for Euros, you probably own it, and if you don't and this type of optimizing/puzzle-solving is your thing, then why heck don't you already own this?  Don't you know this won a whole bunch of awards that I cannot even pronounce?  

If this isn't your thing, then run far and fast.  Me?  I'm indifferent.  I like optimization puzzles for a couple of tries, but they get old pretty quickly (which is why I'm happy to let others buy them and play their copies).  I'll play it, and for a short filler for 3, I may even [i]recommend[/i] it, but it's not one that I would run out and buy, nor is it one that I'm going to center my game-playing night around ("Sorry, I can't play [thing=91][/thing] right now.  I've been waiting all night to get into this game of 7 Wonders.  Can I take a rain check?")

But in defense of it, it's one of the better Euros that I don't own and maybe the best 3+ player Euro that plays in about 20 minutes.  It's not worthy of "game of the year" hype, since it's really just another Euro, but folks who vote on this probably never played anything but Euros.  For instance, I watched the BGG-produced video in which the lady said, "Don't be intimidated by the complexity."  10 minutes later, when I finally stopped laughing, I commented that she's obviously never played a wargame or anything by Fantasy Flight.  Hint: it ain't complicated. As a matter of fact, it's greatest charm is the combination of its simplicity, it plays in less than 15 minutes, has more choices in it than its peers, and that after about 5 games you should be ready to play with anybody, and because of that, I kind of like it: it's a filler that doesn't [i]feel[/i] like a filler.

If I were rating it against other Euros, it would probably be an 8, but compared to a world of awesome wargames and Ameri-Trash, it gets a 6, but that's how I roll.

after one play: so and so. quite random and you only care for your left and right neighbour. everybody kind of plays for himself as everybody resolves his card simultanously. You don't have any influence on other players except (very limited) on your direct neighbours. The scores are only calculated at the end, so that you don't really know how well you or other players are doing (except you spend a lot of time calculating the score for them in your head each turn).
It's not a bad game, but I just wanted to list a few concerns from my side.

Видел как играли продавцы в магазине. Очень понравилась. Пока поиграть в нее еще времени не было. Игра на англ., но правила на русском прилагались.
Игра от 2 до 7, но если два игрока, то есть еще один город за который ходят по очереди. Поэтому советуют знакомится с игрой при трех и более игроках...а уж потом можно и вдвоем играть.
В выходные сыграли в троем. Даже не зная правил партия заняла всего около часа. Игра всем понравилась. Победа была неожиданной. В следующий раз будет нужен более точный расчет действий )))
При изученных правилах игра занимает около 30 минут. Всем пока нравится.

Absolutely wonderful game!  Easy to play, easy to teach, easy to grasp, difficult to succeed (and there are different paths to consider).  Very well done!

So why a '9' and not a '10'?  Well...  It gets stale.  The replay value isn't off the charts, or at least it's not high enough.  I have +30 plays of this (guesstimating, probably more) and it's gotten stale.  Also, while fast for a multiplayer game (very fast), AP can set in and stall everyone while one person puzzles it out.

But really, play this!  It's very, *very* good!

A simple mechanic, extraordinary graphics and a nice idea for this strong filler. The wide player range and the short playing time make this game hit the table very often. Without expansions it gets repetitive after a while and it would be a little too simple. Fortunately Leaders and Cities really enhanced the potential of this game.

The gameplay is simple, but it also comes with very interesting choices to make. I don't understand, why so many people complain about the low interaction. Now this is true with too many players around the table and it's also true that all you can do to damage your opponents is to pick cards that would be too powerful for their strategy... but this what draft is all about! It DOESN'T mean that there's no interaction, because you have to foresee what your opponents want to do. What cards have the chance to come back? What card do I need to pick right away? Choosing the right card at the right time is crucial to win the game.

What do I need to get during this age to score the most points? Which card from this hand can come back in 4 turns? Is it better to pick this card that gives me a lot of points or this one that gives me less, but it would be too good for her/him? This is of course indirect interaction, but does the game really need some "take that" to be better? For sure not for me! 7 Wonders is great as it is.

Rating without the expansions: 7.5

Short and engaging game. Tactic, strategy and a sense of accomplishement in only 30 minutes, few games can offer so much. You can play with 2-7 players, but I think that the game is better with fewer players (3-4). The 2-player variant is not bad, but is quite a different experience that with more players.

The best card development game until now. Selecting cards by drafting and placing them in front of you doesn't give you much competitiveness, but since everything is worth points at the end, you have to really figure out which way is the best to get in front of all your opponents (cultural victory, economic or warfare). For first timers it is hard to grasp the end scoring, but after a few plays everything settles.

Bought from Games Lore at the UK Games Expo, Birmingham, 26/5/2012. Very good Euro type card game. Quick "filler" game plays in 30-40 minutes for 3-5 players. Have not played with other numbers yet. Little direct player interaction and you can only really influence the players to your immediate left or right - or in a 3 player game everyone! Plays differently with differing nos of players. VERY good game. I love this design.

Great game, fast and with enough complexity. The different card type strategies have different weights, so the problem with the base game is that the Green/Blue cards strategy is always better than using military strategy. So using the expansions makes this game better for other paths of winning.

7 Wonders takes up a lot of table space - as soon as the fourth player. The fiddliness is a dealbreaker; icons and tokens litter the playing space and scoring is byzantine. This inability to track the game state means the game is pointless as a competitive pursuit, yet there is too much going on for this to be a casual game. 

I'll play it if you want, but I'd rather play Race For The Galaxy as a competitive many-playered card game.

I like this game, but not as much as some of my friends do. It's very complex and has a lot of options for strategy, and I think that's really great. However, some of my friends are very slow with picking cards, and that makes the game drag on and become less fun. perhaps I would enjoy it more with a different group of people, but for now it's a good game, and I'm usually, but not always, up for it.

** My roommate and I bought this together, and it is one I will let her have when we move out, and likely not repurchase.

Great game. It would be very hard for me to refuse to play. I like the card drafting mechanics a lot, even if your whole game is heavily affected from the initial wonder you get.

I love drafting for its limited turn choices for overall strategy. However my group enjoys 7 Blunders (golf scoring) just as much as 7 Wonders. 7 Blunders is just as balanced. This does not legitimize the game for me. The dominant strategy is mainly, "what gets me the most/least points?" since you have to know the guilds to stylize toward one guild. Which you can't do. If I want to play a civilization builder, I also want to create an efficient engine. See Race For the Galaxy. I don't request this for the table, but I happily play both variants.

The first time I played this game, I was underwhelmed.  It was short and ended abruptly.  We played again, and then again, and by the time we played the 4th game, everything started to click.  Every game, and we've played tons now, feels different.  There are limited choices, but you have to make your strategy as you go.  If you try to stick to one strategy, others will block you easily, and the cards will not come to you the way you need them to every time.  The game has gotten longer because we all think a little bit more each time we draft a card.  I love this game, and I will play it any time with any player count.  

My only wish is that there was a better symbol system for building chains of buildings.  It's too easy to overlook or just miss that you have build a preliminary building.  Sure, as time goes on, you begin to memorize them.  Also, some more randomness in the cards, so your unsure which ones will be in the game.  That would be nice.

Excellent game, very replayable, with very interesting tactical concepts. Short timeplay, very fast set up. Easy to learn. Disagree with opinions that say that there is a lot of random: you see the cards, you choose one, you pass them to your opponent. There are no secrets there. But useless to play with strategy. The essence of 7W, to me, is the fast analysis and reaction. Strategy must be changed each turn (which equals to not having one at all).

I do like this game... and despite having played it at least three times, still feel I've never really grasped the rules; gameplay; intracacies and scoring system.

NOT a simple game; DEFINATELY a game which will favour those who've played previously, whilst leaving new players somewhat in the dark (and lagging behind on points).

That said, I actually won the 1st game I played, simply by collecting cards I saw others were not.

My wife really enjoys this game; which may sway a Christmas purchase. 

More table time needed before final conclusion.

This is what user scud-o (I think that was his name) described it as: a "second-step" game. The iconography is a tad bit complex for anyone who has had no experience of designer games. If a player has played at least gateways, it won't be a problem, and will be an ideal game that will appeal to all sorts of gamers, ranging from novices to Martin Wallace fans.

It is a weird game: it is a filler, and yet, at the same time, it is a very deep game. It is multi-player solitaire, and at the same time, is highly interactive. One MUST constantly be aware of what their opponents are doing, and play one's cards accordingly, or you WILL lose! This results in an extremely tense game after the first few rounds. There are also two interesting ways in which a player can get rid of cards that they don't want, and (even more so) don't want their opponents to have, which strikes me as remarkably similar to the Space Race Track in Twilight Struggle!

The artwork in 7 Wonders is gorgeous! And, while the game's not "dripping" with theme, it is nevertheless very well themed indeed! An excellent civ-building game that I enjoy even more than Francis Tresham's Civilization.

My only significant criticism is the size of the player boards: it is fairly difficult keeping your played cards neat and organized. That wouldn't be a big issue for me, except given the ridiculously high price that is charged for what is essentially just a card game, the buyer should be given more.

7 Wonders definitely will be a Hall of Fame sort of game!

Gorgeous game, with many clever mechanics. As with a lot of euros, the theme is kinda pasted-on (it feels more like card-collecting than civilization-building), and conflict is kept to a minimum, but it plays fast with no downtime. However, scoring is a pain in the ass (way too long and complicated). I have recently lowered my rating for this game because in the end, its success in my house was really a big flash in the pan. Now that we've stopped playing it, no one wants to pick it up again. Like this chewing gum that tastes great for a few seconds, then loses its flavor...

Set collection and drafting with some asymmetrical positioning to make it interesting.  I'm not sold on the need for the leaders expansion, but the cities adds some new elements.

If everyone playing is familiar with the game, there are a lot of second-order strategies to pursue.

The theme translates surprisingly well since all you're really doing is choosing cards. I love the ancient civ setting.

The various routes to build up your tableau are well designed. Unfortunately, the symbology is a bit idiosyncratic. It can be quite mystifying at times for new players. 

But it's fun! 7 Wonders has set the bar for strategic card drafting games these days. It's not incredibly deep, but it is a very enjoyable game. Probably more of a '7' for me without expansions. But Cities and Leaders keep it pretty fresh. And occasionally playing with Babel is nice too.

Great game! Played fast with up to 7 player.  Each game about 30 mins and we can keep playing for a few rounds.  We all just want to try again and again to get higher score.  Each game feel different as you can do different things and use different strategy.  Fast and fun.  

I had so much expectation for this game, and yes, it's definitely one of the highest rating game I've so far!

Nice filler game with an ancient theme that can be played in 20-30 minutes allowing for multiple games. Better with 3-4 people it can go up to 7 but manages not being a party game. Very much recommended for what it is. A quick light strategy game.

Extraordinario juego para pasar un rato agradable con los amigos. Las mecánicas principales son el draft de cartas y el set collection. Se expica rápido y aunque las primeras partidas se pueden hacer más largas, cuando le coges el rollo las terminas en 40 minutos. Funciona a 2 jugadores aunque quizá lo ideal es jugarlo a 4

RATING: 5.5
Some people love drafting in and of itself. I'm fine with it as a mechanism for balancing starting positions and/or for letting people target a particular strategy. But, always, I want that to be a preparatory step for -the game-. Here, that is the game. There's no further game. Pick out items from a menu, pick out more items from the menu, and then...pick out more. For me, it ends before I ever actually got anything I ordered. It ends with a big pile of things I wanted in front of me, all unfulfilled.

No theme. No interaction between players. All you do is sit and stare at your hand and shuffle some things around in front of yourself, and try to organize them in a way that the game makers decided was more-or-less score-worthy.

If I'm going to play a game with no theme, I'd rather play Sushi Go. It's the same game, but with less pomposity, and whimsy and light enough that you can chat with the other players. But, really, I'd rather play Shadow Throne. Theme, bluffing, strategy, and interaction. Most importantly, it's actually a game. Set collection just really isn't. It's a cheap cheat to make it seem like there's more depth to your game than there really is.

Everyone loves this one. If we are going to play a hand management game, it's going to be 7 Wonders over Catan or Ticket to Ride.

A modern classic. The draft mechanism lets the game play fast. The game is well balanced and different strategies can lead to victory.

2-7(4)

As a multiplayer this is ... not bad. I'll give it a bonus for quickly handling lots of players. I find that, not intuitively, building your wonder actually doesn't seem all that powerful, whereas it feels like it should be a major focus. I do think it plays best with four or so in that you still want to be aware of everybody's tableau (e.g. ensuring somebody doesn't get too many science points). The balance at this point feels okay. Some good ways to score with military, science, trade buildings, and sometimes guilds. It can get awfully crowded and be awfully hard to keep track of your resources (sometimes people don't realize the goods they have available, or which buildings they can build for free).

I don't think I'll be playing the 2p variant any time soon. It's just additionally wonky to me with the neutral city, and it loses much of its pace there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
1st impression after 3 plays at Pacificon 2011.  Mechanism is MtG draft, down time is minimal since everyone is making choice at the same time.  Seems to scale well since certain cards are removed based on number of players.  Most game lasted may be an hour once you figure out how to play.  with the left-right-left rotation, you really need to be on your toes especially with the military cards.

Finally had a chance to play this with Niall and Greg.  Great game.

Bought from BGG marketplace Alexd for $28.  2nd ed.  This has the Manneken Pls promo.

RATING: 9
Draft has always been my favorite competitive Magic: The Gathering format, so I guess I'm not too surprised that I'm a fan of a game that is purely drafting.  Plays fast and accommodates a range of numbers of players.  Great card quality, with cards being nearly full-art, but a weird size makes them harder to sleeve.  Has the unfortunate feature of being one of those games that really cares about how the group is seated when there are different skill levels.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I like that the game can be played with a few players (3) or with a lot of players (7) and it is still the same game (basically).

Scoring seems chaotic at first (Q. Wait, you mean everything scores points? A. Pretty much) but eventually it all makes sense.

Not sure how much re-playability the game will have long term.

7 Wonders combines card drafting with some light engine building, leeching off your neighbours (you can purchase resources that only they produce and several cards will score you points for their buildings), and an arms race. For a quick, simple game, it gives you quite a few things to consider. 

The most interesting decisions are about how much of a production engine you need and what it should produce.  Those decisions are less straightforward than in many efficiency games because of the ability to make use of what your neighbours produce - provided that you have money.  There is also some balancing of present versus potential reward in your card choices.  

Rather less interesting is that the game offers but three main ways of scoring victory points (military dominance or collecting science or civil cards)and a winning strategy will probably pursue two of those routes. The individual wonders and how you tailor your play to make the most of their rewards are almost all the game offers by way of strategic variation.  Certainly, after 10 or so plays it feels tapped out to me.

The artwork and production quality are both good.  I found the plentiful icons rather easier to grasp than in many other games. My one gripe is with the out-sized box and the inflated price that goes with it.

Christmas present from my brother. Civbuilding game, that is more like magic draft light. But thats fine. It won't take long to play a game and there is no waiting for other players since you take your turns simultaneously.

Easy and fun to play. I also like the graphics. There are enough choices and interaction. Plays well with any number of players. What's not to like?

Update: I find the game more enjoyable with 4 or max 5 players. With only 3 everyone has access to all materials and its very easy to focus on one category scoring a lot of points. Also if 2 of the 3 players fight over the same category they both just loose to the third player. 
On the other hand with 6-7 players the game turns more chaotic.

10-Jan-2015 Traded A Study in Emerald for a copy of this :)

Played this for the first time. I'm not sure about it; I enjoyed how quickly it played and everybody resolving their own stuff at the same time. I didn't really like the drafting phase because of all the choices! I might enjoy it more if knew what was going on better and what cards were coming up in later ages.

I've played this twice now, really enjoyed it the second time, even though I was the only noob playing with three other experienced players. A must have.

9/8/15 - Finally got to play this game over the holiday weekend, and though we were all weirded out about the symbols and what we were supposed to do, it surprisingly went quickly, and was well-received. Jessica especially picked it up rather quickly, and in almost every game so far has put up 30+ points, and I'm averaging about 40+ in my five games (with no freaking wins). Tanya had two abysmal games and three wins, so take that however. All in all, though, we all enjoy it. Now to get Clara to play!

8/8/15 - Just received my copy. Quick scan of the rules makes me hope it's easier to pick up then the rules would suggest (not for me, but some of the people I play with). Can't wait to break it out.

I really love the draft mechanic of this game.  It's one of the few things I enjoyed from when I played Magic: The Gathering.  It's quick to teach as well as quick to play (at least for my group).  And some of the finer strategic points were picked up by my group fairly quickly so it made for challenging games straight away practically. 

The 2-player expert variant is also very enjoyable for myself and my wife!  This will likely be part of our regular game rotation for quite some time.

RATING: 7
When you strip it down to its essence, it's a card drafting game, with the attendant benefits and drawbacks (one new or weak player at the table can really hand victory to his or her neighbors). Lots of moving parts, so it can be a bit hard to get your head around at first, but all those moving parts really add replay value.

RATING: 8
Fast paced with everyone taking terms simultaneously while "drafting" cards for their civilization. The entire game is just drafting cards, but there are so many options on how to build up your city and other players' choices will effect you. The game is a little difficult to teach someone, but after one 30 minute play-through they will understand. 

Great balance of german-style building, and player interaction.

My only concern is long-term replay-ability, after 20+ games it's still the same small set of cards.

Without the Leaders and Cities expansions, I always feel that it lacks much of the complexity I enjoy.  Played with the expansions (including the Great Projects of Babel), this would be much higher on the list.  A game that can play up to 7 or 8 players in under 40 minutes with this amount of depth is astounding.

That said, I only own the base game since all of my close friends and family members have the whole collection. I really enjoy the dummy player of the two-player game, but since my wife and I don't have the expansions, we never play this at home. 

Honestly, I like Sushi Go! better than 7 Wonders.

No idea why this is rated so high. It is certainly 'OK', but does not seem special to me - lots of mechanics very familiar from other games, where the whole seems to be less than the sum of its parts. I have no objection to playing it, but there are plenty of much better games out there.

I think this is a good game for what it is.  yes it's a draft and the interaction is just not giving your neighbors what they need, and it's pretty random with the draft especially the more ppl that are playing.  But the funny thing is, everyone is on a pretty much level playing field.  I'm sure some really smart folks could count cards and do some crazy probabilities, but I don't think it would help that much.  although it is a bit of a pasted on theme, i like it better than puerto rico's.  you just try and get as many VP as you can and every round is kinda exciting to see what you will be passed.

The game pretty much plays itself at higher player counts, so I prefer this with 3-4 players.

Don't understand what the fuss is about. Mediocre game. Drafting to hose others leaves you in a weak position against everyone else, so the natural way is to play like you are playing solo. Very little meaningful options. Strategy is mostly non existent because cards don't go full circle and it is impossible to foresee what you will draw. 
Theme is transparent and another thing i didn't like was that almost everyone was looking silently at his cards. =>social interaction ~0 

A game i would rather avoid, unless there is no other option.

Clearly, passing cards is a fun mechanic (remember doing that in hearts?)  Scales very well.  Makes a lot of gamers happy; definitely a phenom.  I like it, not so much love it. If you like card effects games, this and Glory To Rome, I believe are the most elegant in execution.

RATING: 7
Well, this is a nice filler(ish) game. It plays fast, it's fun and even non-gamers can enjoy it. There is little to no downtime and always tough decision to do with the cards. Of course luck of the draw plays a big part in the game and it can be a bit random, so tactical decisions usually outweigh strategic ones. I love the art and the quality of components. I'd also say that this needs at least 4 players to be interesting. Overall a game that is never boring and the winner is surprisingly hard to detect before counting up the scores.

Well, this is way more fun than last year's hot game [thing=36218][/thing].  The passing-hands-around is an excellent mechanic that makes sure everyone has something to do all the time and that the game scales well.  And the brightly-coloured oversize cards are attractive.

I think the strategy may not be all that interesting though.  In fact I'm kind of hoping someone comes out with a more interesting game with the passing-hands mechanic.

RATING: 7
The game can accommodate a lot of players without too much of a downtime thanks to the draft mechanic, which is unusual for euro style games. Unfortunately, the game shows its age, as different civilizations are bland, uninteresting and an afterthought. The game itself doesn't evoke its theme, and you won't feel as good if you finished your wonder compared when building a few key buildings. No epic feel.

This works well with up to seven people because everyone plays simultaneously, so you don't have to wait for six other people to take their turns. The downside is that your neighbours don't affect you much, so it sometimes feels like seven people playing solitaire together.

I like that it allows several different ways to win, so if you are behind, you usually have ways of catching up. The downside is that it doesn't allow for much long-term strategy, you just have to make plays one at a time.

It has some good features and some flaws, but overall I have fun playing it.

I have only played this one twice so far, but I do enjoy it. I like drafting, and the civilization theme, while feeling a bit pasted on, does appeal to me. My rating may change after additional plays. 

update: I've played several more times since my initial comment and I still feel the game is pretty solid. I can't quite put my finger on what it is that prevents me from rating it higher, though I do feel 8 is a really good score (as you can see I tend to be tough in my ratings). I have not gotten to check out Cities or Leaders yet, but it will not be long until that happens.

RATING: N/A
No rating here because no full play through. We really wanted to like this one since it is so popular. But it just did not work. 1st of all it is a drafting game and those types of games need more than two players to make them work as good as they can. 7 Wonders comes with a 2-player variant but it is a dummy player called the Free-City where players take turns controlling it to assign cards to build it up. That isn't a "dummy player." It is a part of players' strategies. Plus that is so fiddly. It's just one more thing to have to keep up with. So with more than 2 we are sure it works very well. But as with most other drafting games it doesn't do 2 very well.

It takes a bit of time to set up/sift through the cards to make sure you are using the right ones for the amount of players, but being able to play up to 7 people is an incredible bonus and barely adds time to the game. Absolutely deserving of all it's awards.

This game is amazing. A civilization building game that can be played quickly and without a huge amount of setup. This can be played with non-gaming people if they are willing to learn a little bit. By the time age 3 rolled around on their first game, my family had caught on and understood the game. They were even having fun, especially competing on the military side of things! I'm always willing to play this one. The 2 player version is solid, but not as good as 3-5 players. I've never played more than 5. Overall, 9.5/10.

A very cool filler. It plays really well from 4 to 7 players, without increasing playtime.

I think the drafting mechanics is brilliant and everyone I present this game to seems to agree with it.

But I get the feeling that it doesn't matter how many players you're playing this game with, it always seems like a 3-player game, for you only get affected by what your right and left neighbors do.

In that sense, when you're playing with many players, it seems to me that victory is much more a matter of circumstance than of smart playing, because in order to win, you're gonna have to be the top scorer on the two or three different 3-player games happening simultaneously around the table.

In other words, 7 Wonders with many players is a game with quite a lot of chaos going on, over which your control is pretty limited. That is why I'd rather play it with only 3 or 4 players.

After one play with 4: An enjoyable activity, but I'm not sure how much strategic depth there is.

Quick and "deep" filler.

Turns seem forced and there is little to no interaction with anyone but your neighbours. It is well designed and uses the fun idea of card drafting. I just don't really like it as there is not enough going on of interest. Usually there are about two or three cards that will work for you. Pick one of them them and hope you get passed something good. Or look at the person next to you, what card works for them? Use that card to deny them.

Easy to learn even though the icons look confusing.

I think it's a fair design.  Commend the scalability in terms of time - which comes with simultaneous actions - but I haven't actually played it with more or less than 4 players.  I love drafting Magic and Agricola, and this didn't even begin to scratch that itch for me.  Overall I thought it was okay, and wouldn't mind playing again, but I didn't find myself interested in scoring paths and thought the game would benefit from even more simplicity, especially in the third round.  Didn't really think about the game after playing, and it made me want to replay Innovation.

I'll rate this one as an 8 for now, with potential to go up with future plays.  I enjoy the drafting, and I think it's great that there are a ton of ways to score points.  There's a ton of symbols to learn, but it seems a little easier to decipher them than, say, RFTG.  More plays needed, but I like it for now.  A great quick game for a lot of players.

SECOND PLAY: Still really like it.  Four plays well.

If you wanted to play a board game where resources moved along a conveyer belt. Sometimes your neighbors will buy the right things you need if you depend on them. Sometimes they don't. Sometimes you will have the biggest army among your neighbors. Sometimes you won't. The game feels like it rewards strategy for a game that can only build strategy in retrospect. It just isn't deep.

RATING: 7
I can see the appeal, but I don't think card drafting is my forte.  My biggest issue with this game is how unbalanced it can be when playing with multiple skill levels.  New person doesn't understand to not pass all the science to one person?  Game over.  A game can also be ruined if you are the one sitting next to someone who is collecting science, because you are forced to take their science cards, often at the expense of your own game.

Overall, I think this is a good game, and I am happy to play it.  But I'm not sure it deserves quite as much praise as it gets.

Won this in the G4GG Summer Secret Santa!

I enjoy civilization building as a theme, and this game really captures that feeling while maintaining a concise playing time. I like how the game abstracts a board by making each player worry only about the civilizations to their right and left.

Not so great with two players, as my wife and I have discovered, but I'm very glad to have this around for when people are over and when the kids get old enough to play it!

Very solid game that delivers on its play time and easy of play but still retains a fun factor for experienced gamers.  There is an interesting mix of planning and luck - you don't always get to do the former and your opponents don't always get the latter.  Is it a gamer's game?  Not really, but it was good to see it win an award.  The design is well executed as is the production.  I am normally against the hype machine, but this time they might have it right.

Preliminary view is that I think it is a bit thin, but for a 30 minute game there is a lot of interaction and interesting variation in strategies. That said, I do not care for the two-player variant.

Wasn't thrilled with the game my first play through, but that was just because I found the fast pace of pass and play drafting not to mesh well with these staggering monuments of civilization.

One thing that I like about this game is that it scales extremely well up to 7 players without adding downtime.  I was concerned that this might be too light, but that doesn't appear to be the case.  The multiple paths to victory seem pretty balanced.  I think that it is much easier to explain than Race for the Galaxy and Glory to Rome.

One of the best things about this game is that it is fast.

I played this with 6 players and it just doesn't work with that many players. You are entirely dependant on the players to your left and right and have no interation with anyone else.

Simple to play once the rules have been explained, after all it could be argued you only make 18 decisions over the entire game.
Rewards some specialisation as working to all things is going to lead to low scores in each. But you can't put all your effort into just one area. (Or so I think.)

Very nice game. Fast, easy-to-learn and with many options. I was amazed by its design since I think it is very hard to construct a game that plays with 7 in the same time that it takes to play it with 3.

So simple and yet so interesting! Always in for a game!

RATING: 6
Pleasant game that I can repeatedly play in spite of it being more pastime than a compelling game.  It is mostly saved by very good production quality, short tight game time, and accommodation of a large number of players without getting slow.

The ironic thing is that while this game has many layers and lots of detailed balanced interaction, it turns out to be quite shallow.  Normally this dooms a game to low replay value.  In the case of 7W, the investment to a play is so low, and the gameplay so tight, that I still do not mind replays.

In other words, it is a tasty little candy, not a satisfying meal.

A go to game for when you 3 to 8 players and time is a factor (can pretty easily play in 30 to 60 minutes even with people not very familiar)...and one of the very best games that allows for 6 to 8 players.

The only thing I don't care for is how little control you have in a game (especially at a larger table), also it can be a little frustrating when you think things are going awesome and every card you played flowed well only to find out you ended up in 3rd and don't really have any idea what you could have done better.

My friends and I thoroughly enjoyed this game once we got over some initial frustration learning the rules.  There's a 1/2 hour YouTube video which explained the mechanics extremely well.   The things I liked about this game were the quality components, the ease of play, the good mix of strategy and luck, the fast pace, the short duration, and the Euro style (which I'm new to), while maintaining a military aspect.   I'm a wargamer who so far has only been able to get new gamers to play Risk, cos it's most familiar.   But it can get cutthroat and can leave bad feelings.  I love that everyone stays in the game until the very end.  And I didn't even mind that I lost both times!  There seems to be endless replayability.   It played well with 5, but I can see how it would play just as well with 3-7, which is another really nice thing about this game, since many other games have a much narrower range of "optimal number of players".

Among the greatest medium-light games and simplest civilization games. This game is the benchmark for private drafting games. The idiosyncratic frequency of the number 7 is quite clever: 7 wonders, 7 resources, 7 card types, 7 scoring vectors, and probably some other ones I'm missing.

This is one of the games to pull out when you've got 30 minutes and a flexible number of people.

I really love this game.  It's best with 3 or more players.  I am frustrated that it was marketed as a 2-7 player game.  The 2 player version requires that you play with an extra "free" city and the flow is strange.   They, of course, later came out with 7 Wonders Duel  but the cheapskate in me hasn't wanted to spend the money on a game I already have that "kind of" works 2 player.

Not bad for a card-driven game.

The drafting mechanic makes you consider your decisions, consider the decisions of those around you, and really change your strategies based on what's on the board.

RATING: 8.2
The initial reason for this high rating was that after the first game, everyone immediately wanted to play again. The game feels _fun_ (and retains that feel after playing more). The game also has longevity, and a subtlety which you only slowly learn to appreciate. I'm much more excited about playing the game now, after 30+ plays, than I was after 5 plays. (Was in fact nearly uninterested in the game after 10 plays.)

Plays very swift, but is not as light / devoid of meaningful choices as one might expect based on other comments, particularly in a 4-player game. There's several opportunities per game of screwing over your neighbours by handing them only bad choices (which can include gleeful taunting), and the different strategies you can follow in the game do each have their own distinct feel. Paying attention to your neighbours is important, but in the end you're going to have to accept that no matter how well you play, luck will remain a factor in this game. As you play the game more often, though, and play with a table of equally experienced players, you'll learn that the choices that lead to a win are subtle and very fine indeed, and the game becomes a very careful balancing act in building up your resources (or ways to acquire them) _just_ far enough to enable to you to more efficiently build a better mix of point-scoring cards. Yet add a single inexperienced player to the table, and it's all thrown out of whack again.

The 2-player version works surprisingly well, and I'd rate that a 7.5

RATING: 7
For me, the biggest negative about this game is how having a weak player to the left/right of you is one of the best assets in this game. Simply put, this game is all about evaluating the best VP-return for yourself and your opponents. Thus, a card that gives you the most VP may actually be a bad decision if taking another card would create a bigger VP-spread between you and your opponent. 

That being said, the game plays a large number of players very quickly and is filled with interesting decisions. I never feel bored with this game and I never feel like decisions are too obvious. I wouldn't call it a deep game but there is certainly has enough interesting decisions to entertain most gamers. Overall, a great design.

It feels forever since the last time I awarded a perffect 10 score to a board game. My first impressions of this little gem were a bit negative; I just didn't get what all the fuzz was about after a couple online plays.

And then, it clicked. And how. This game gives the initial impression of being yet another exercise in multiplayer solitaire, and with little control to top it all out. Instead, there are myriads of fways you interact with others, from the outright commerce and military issues, to the more subtle interception of highly needed cards by your neighbours. And the "control" issue? It's just nonsense; the game has so varied uses for each card, you can almost always adapt what you've got to what you need.

A great game I can't wait to buy and play it over and over again.

Update (July 25th 2011): I bought it, and played it face to face. It's even better. Great, great game.

UPDATE: I still love it, but it's no longer amongst my favorites. Perhaps I've played it a bit too much? Down to a 9.

7 Wonders fills an unusual void in my collection.  Plays up to 7 (but not a party game) and the game lasts 30 minutes.  

It's got a fair amount of satisfying tactical gameplay.  I suppose it's what people call a "super filler"  

I dont know anyone who loves it, but everyone seems to like it and thats pretty much how I feel.  I like how it plays, but I love what it can do for a large group of gamers who all want to sit at the same table together.

It's a solid game and a perfect '7' on the BGG scale (go figure!)

RATING: 10
A civ game in 30 minutes, well kind of...

On your turn you play 1 of your 7 cards, then pass the rest of your cards to another player, you receive 6 cards, play another card and so on, until you are passed 2 cards, at that time play one and discard the other. That comprises an age, play through 3 ages and finish the game and count points... It's that easy.

Let's see how this game holds up with more plays.

Seems that the most viable option for scoring a lot of points is through green cards (science points) and through purple cards (guild cards). Improving your Wonder is probably a good ideia since you can get rid of a useless card or, even better, a powerful card that one of your opponents wants.

Plays from 2 to 7 with no extra time loss. Since everyone plays simultaneously.

Edit: It has been holding up pretty well, this game is very addictive! But after adding 1 or 2 expansions and then going back to the basic game it feels too simple, but still this is a must have.

Hand-drafting and per-round simultaneous play means no downtime. And because the game hinges on making tough (or, sometimes, obvious) choices about what is in front of you, it never feels like you know exactly what is going on in the game world at large, and thus are in the dark about the ultimate victor until the points are tallied at the end. Everyone is fully involved at every stage. Just great! (And all the expansions just make things better).

Nagyon jó! Gyanús, hogy meg kell venni... Szabályok nem túl bonyolultak, és a hossza is meglepően rövid (max. 1 óra), pedig elég soktényezős, jópár út vezethet a nyeréshez! Kiegyenlített is, volt olyan 5 személyes játék, ahol hárman azonos ponttal végeztünk. A kártyaleosztás mechanizmusa hasonlít az Agricola haladó kártyaelosztásához, meg a Fairy tale alapmechanizmusához.
---
Na megvettem. Amilyen jó maga a játék, olyan siralmas a minőség:( Az egyik csoda pl. durván el volt szakadva, a felső dobozrésznél a ragasztás semmit sem fog.
---
Kár a kivitelezési hibákért, mert maga a játék ma is meggyőzött: ez az a kategória, amivel bármikor játszanék, főleg hogy ilyen rövid.
---
Kipróbáltuk ketten is, így kvázi háromszemélyes, mert van egy fiktív játékos. Meglepően jól működik, kifejezetten élvezetes így is!! Nagyon sok olyan taktikai lehetőség bukkan fel, ami a többi létszámnál nem. A harmadik csodát felváltva irányítjuk, ezen keresztül kihatással lehetünk a pénzáramlásra, a harci erőviszonyokra, a másiknak nagyon fontos lapoktól tudunk megszabadulni, stb. Vigyázni kell, hogy nehogy végül a fiktív játékos nyerjen:)
---
Elsőre is tetszett, de csak 40-50 parti után kezdtem el igazán megszeretni! Fantasztikus, hogy a jól kitalált alapmechanizmusból mennyit ki lehet hozni. Szinte korlátlan mennyiségben vannak új csodák a neten, amik nem nehezítik a játékot, csak a varianciát növelik. Az egyik legnagyobb újrajátszhatósági faktorú játék szerintem, ha valaki nem riad vissza a sok kiegtől. A félhivatalos paklikkal együtt eddig 5 kieg pakli van a játékhoz, mindegyik egy új színt (szó szerint is) visz bele, persze mind együtt már talán túl bonyolult, de lehet válogatni...
Még ha a gyerekkoromban gyakran játszott játékokat (Snapszer, römi, amőba) számoljuk is, akkor is az 5-6 leggyakrabban játszott játékom közt van, nem véletlenül. Fel is nyomom 9 pontra:)
---
Nem hiszem, hogy volt már olyan játék életemben, amivel 50 nap alatt 70 partit játszottam, a 7 Wonders az első ilyen. És még nincs vége a házi bajnokságunknak, de már így is elmondhatom, hogy ez a játék a kiegekkel együtt gyakorlatilag megunhatatlan. Már az alapban is sok játék van, de ha váltogatjuk a Bábelt, Leaderst, Citiest, vagy akár kombináljuk ezeket, mindig annyira más-más élményt kapunk, nem is beszélve a sok csodáról, hogy simán lenyomható folyamatos alkalmakon akár 50-100 parti is. Mi még pár hétig nyomjuk, aztán félretesszük egy évre, de tuti elő fog még kerülni hasonló maratoni játékfolyamokra, mert nagyon szeretjük az alapot is és az összes kieget. A házi bajnokságunk egyébként nem elsősorban egyének közti verseny (bár az is), inkább azt próbáltuk letesztelni, melyik csodák az erősebbek. Az eddig megjelent 15 gyári csoda mellett 24 rajongói csodát is versenyeztettünk. Sokkal több van fenn a neten, ez a 24 már egy 2013-as szűrésünk eredménye, akkor kiválasztottuk és legyártattuk a legötletesebb, legleteszteltebbnek tűnt csodákat. Így tehát 39 csoda versenyzett, és mivel 3-an voltunk, hármasával küzdöttek meg egymással a csodák, mindegyiknek 3 parti jutott, hogy mindenki minden csodával pontosan egyszer játsszon. A 13 győztes csoda és még a 2 legjobb második továbbment a rájátszásba, onnan hasonló módszerrel továbbment a legjobb 6, majd a legjobb 3 került a döntőbe. Itt tartunk most. A döntőben egy gyári csoda lesz, a Manneken Pis (mellette a Persepolis és Atlantis nevű rajongói csodák). Általános tapasztalat, hogy nagyon jól szerepelnek a kevés szintes csodák (ami logikus is, hiszen akciókat spórolunk velük), pl. Manneken Pisnek az 1 szintű oldala volt nagyon erős. Másik tapasztalat, hogy általában a viszonylag egyszerű csodák a jobbak: semmi varázslat, egyszerűen pénzt és pontot adnak meg esetleg fegyvert. Jellemzően a 10 pont + 5 pénz meg még valami kis extra kedvezményt adó csodák számítanak nyerőnek, de pl. Manneken 1 szintre ad 7 pontot 7 pénzt és 1 fegyvert. Kivétel pl. Róma, amelyiknek az egyik oldala teljesen speciális, de nagyon jól szerepelt (Róma 7. lett). Általában kevés az olyan csoda, mint Róma, amelynek mindkét oldala versenyképes. Volt olyan csoda, amelyiknek az egyik oldalával szinte mindig nyertünk, a másik oldalával meg szinte sosem. De a verseny szempontjából ez nem számít, mivel mi döntjük el, melyik oldalt választjuk, így egy jó oldal elég lehet a legjobb csoda házi címhez:)
Kíváncsian várjuk az újabb kieget, bár nekünk már az eddigiek is szinte kimeríthetetlen újrajátszást adnak. Hogy mást ne mondjak, pl. a Bábel totál más játékélmény, mint bármelyik másik kieg vagy az alap.

edit: after a few more plays and after trying among the stars..pfff..it just isn't up to it for me.

First Impressions.  I played the game 3 times in one sitting with 4 and 5 players and the game worked fine enough.  I just found it a bit too light and the choices arbitrary.  There isn't much tension in the game.  It really is damned if you do damned if you don't when choosing the cards to play.  My excitement for the game quickly deflated.  I felt like there weren't much interesting choices to be made.

Good, relatively fast game regardles of player numbers.  The card drafting is a neat mechanic, but I think it is very off-putting for new players who will nto know/understand the cards combos and end of game scoring.  Hated this the first time I played it, Liked it the second time since I knew better how to strategize my draft. Worth keeping around if newcomers can put up with not having a clue what they are doing the first time around.

So far this has been the default game when hosting gatherings, after a couple rounds most people get the hang of it and are typically eager to play a second game.

As someone who is more interested in heavier games I'm always pleasantly surprised by 7 Wonders. It is just a great card game.  The game length is perfect and it scales well from 4 to 7 players.  The two player variant is flawed, but that's what 7 Wonders Duel is for.  Playing with 3 leaves a little to be desired but is still fun.

It's no wonder this game is ranked so high!

I can only think of 2 downsides:

1. I would like the military/combat to have a bit more subtlety and variation than it does, but not sure how to do that without weighing the game down.

2. I just want each game to last a little longer!  (fortunately, the Cities expansion helps with that)

This is the landmark for future card-game fillers! It is FAST, it accomodates up to 7 players, it is elegantly designed, and it is easily taught to everyone who has at least played a couple of other games.
It is almost tactical, with very little chance to plan a strategy, and I don't know if it will stand the test of hundreds plays, but it is definitely engaging and worth exploring!
A note on pruction quality: artwork is gorgeous, cardboard is thick and durable, but the cards are very thin and show signs of being worn out after the first couple of games... Hopefully adequate sleeves will become available soon!
Update may 21st, 2011: after 15 plays, I am still not sure about the game. The random element is high, but in such a fast paced game this is not a great problem... Nevertheless, I would lower the initial rating (8) to a 7.

call me a party poo-poo head, but I just can't get much excited about a game where so much depends on getting lucky sitting down around the table. will your opponents be willing to pass the coins your way and not the other, will they build much resources, will they go military-heavy, will they concentrate on hate-drafting more than on constructive-drafting... my decisions matter, but I'd like them to matter more

RATING: 8.1
Excellent game... quite unlike anything else in my collection. Only 2 downsides; 1) While the game is actually quite simple, the first teaching game for new players is often difficult, due in part to the bunch of (very well designed) symbols you need to understand, and also to the multi-faceted end game scoring which you need to experience once to know what to aim for in the future. 2) Not a huge amount of obvious interaction, limited mostly to denying cards to neighbours. Both minor problems with a game I've taught and enjoyed with gamers and non-gamers alike.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Base game: A good game but with no meat in it. Most of the decisions in the second half of the game are obvious. I prefer to play this with fewer people to have whatever control on what cards will come back to me. But again, with fewer players I rather play Dominion than this.

With expansions: they do add the meat :) Especially Leaders are a must have if you own 7 Wonders - they force you to play each game differently.

This is a quick, fun game with many different viable strategies to win. I've had many plays, and have yet to see one clear cut strategy that rules them all (though the science path is my favorite for all the free builds and calculation involved in scoring). I enjoy the card drafting mechanic; this keeps the game well balanced because it doesn't involve luck of the draw, as well as the strategies it opens up and interaction between players. Also, the box layout is well thought out, which I greatly appreciate in a game.

RATING: 7
I did play this twice, and I really find it to be a well made, fun game. To have the cards be shifting constantly and hoping that another card comes around to you is fun and makes one a bit anxious. 

The first time we played it, each time I saw the new age's cards I just thought "HOLY CRAP I CAN'T MAKE ALL OF THIS" and loved how quickly they progressed, yet still built on themselves. I'm sure that this is a hard to master game, but it IS easy to pick up.

RATING: 8
7 Wonders is a game that manages to play 3 to 7 (maybe more with expansions) players within the same timeframe and the same amount of tension (regardless of player-count).
This game's design is just a brilliant piece of work!

The game itself is themed around being a mayor of an antique city and building and improving that city (and it's wonder) through 3 ages (an age lasts for 6 rounds).

Each round you have to use one card of your small deck of cards (starting with 7) and giving the rest to your neighbour on the left.
This is another marvellous design that generates a decision making conflict right from the start of the game:
"I could really use card A, but I can't give my neighbour card B nor card C - What should I do?!?"

One of the most famous Drafting Card Games. With a simple mechanic 7 Wonders turns into a fast and big game that can be very enjoyable for 7 players at the same time. That's awesome, but all must be said, there's little interaction between players.

7 Wonders is great and surprisingly deep for a 30 minute game.

A great game that can be played with 3 to 7 people fantastically!  That's worth a high rating in and of itself, but I find this one to not be UBERLY strategic.

Everybody's favorite. Easy and fast to play, a little bit of depth and strategy. Artwork is beautiful. It stands the test of time very well and handles multiple players very well.

RATING: 6
What I like best is that every time I start thinking a single strategy is dominant, I realize that I am wrong.  Very well balanced.  It doesn't quite pay of as a 30 minute civ. games as the mechanics are a little too naked to let the theme breathe.  However, I'll take fluid and engaging mechanics over great theme here.  It is excellent how such a slight game creates the illusion of a heavier game -- not an easy feat.

RATING: 7.8
Need to play this more.  One weakness is that there is actually quite a lot going on so its not perfect for teaching new players or inexperienced gamers where there are now drafting games which are more approachable whilst still being fun for experienced gamers.  Another weakness is it maybe doesnt have the depth that games with drafting but extra elements too offer.  Still a lot of fun and a very scalable game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
After many plays I downgraded the rating as I believe it's too chaotic for what it is! Too much luck involved - at least in a 4+ players game. Some strategy may apply in a 3 player game, but for a 3 players game I would choose another game.

One plus is that it can be played in 5-6-7 players!

I prefer to plan my game out pretty early on, and while this can be done to some extent, it's highly contingent on the cards you get handed. Not a deal breaker, there is room in my collection for this game, but it will only be hitting the table a few times a year.

I feared hardcore gamers used to bigger games would find thisone too light, but surprisingly, lots of my gamers friends find it very fine and interesting. Excellent replayability.

The scaling with player count is very nice, especially in terms of length of game.  Simple to teach the concept, but very difficult for people to learn strategy without playing through a game.  Personally, I feel the decisions aren't very interesting, and highly reactive to the card draws/seating positions.  I can see how it would be more enjoyable to many though.

This is probably the only game that can play up to 7 players - multiple pathways to victory to employ, player interaction and doesn't increase the downtime even with increasing players. Card drafting at its best, more meaty in comparison to Sushi Go!

RATING: 7
This basic mechanism for this game, card drafting, is pretty simple, making it easy to learn.  Simultaneous actions also allows it to scale up well.  Once you know the cards, you can work out your strategies in the first era.  However, you never know whether you’ll ever see the cards you need to execute that strategy.  So even the most skilled player can’t guarantee a win.  However, there are few enough basic strategies that replayability isn’t infinite.  It will probably get boring after a few dozen plays.

RATING: 7
This is a good game.  Much of the praise it has received is deserving.  The artwork is great and the gameplay is fast and fun.  It has a hard time living up to the hype though, and the criticism it gets for lack of variety and strategy is probably deserved as well.  Overall though I like it and will play it a lot.

RATING: 9
Despite the fact that I've lost 70% of the games I've played (are there times when one just has to accept that he's really bad at a game and can't hope to win?), I think 7 Wonders is really solid.  Maybe because I've lost so many times I like it all the more.  

Lately I've played with the same people a few times, and it's been very interesting to try to balance the need for subverting someone else's building potentials while trying to simultaneously construct a solid of my own infrastructure.  This constant tension ... and seeming simplicity of choices in front of someone at any given time, makes the game beautiful.  Shoot ... I think I just talked myself into upping my rating of this game as I wrote my comments.  That's what tells you this is a solid game.

It took me a while to warm up to this. Coming from Magic, drafting is one of my favorite mechanisms. I first planned on getting Fairy Tale, but watched some play throughs and felt like 7 Wonders would be a much more rewarding experience. I enjoy how quick the game can be, even with seven players. There seems to be many paths to victory. Also, the art and theme are just beautiful. I've also purchased Leaders, Cities and Babel. Leaders really improves the game in my opinion. I'll soon be trying out the additional expansions.

RATING: 7
Very good game. My wife always wants me to play this with her. She would probably rate it a 9. 

Pros are quick playtime, and easy to learn. Almost everyone I've taught it to picked up exactly how to play it after the second game. Strategic play comes quickly after that.

Cons are it seems a bit repetitive once you're familiar with all the cards although the varied cards from the drafting mechanic mitigates this a bit. Sometimes bad results can't be avoided due to what's handed to you or lack of a required resource

RATING: 8
(3-8 Players, 30 min, CLASSIC) A civilization-building game featuring nations from across the globe in a contest of drafting. Each turn, players choose one development card from their hand to play, in order to acquire natural resources, build buildings, raise military, or develop sciences. The remaining cards are passed to their neighbor! What you choose is as important as what you give away!

RATING: 9

RATING: 4
7 Wonders is a very 'attractive' game for a variety of reasons. The symbology gives an appearance of complexity, depth and 'geek cred', the game has at least the impression of 'building a civilization', there are unique 'powers' (civilizations) to play with, and it accommodates up to seven players in roughly the same amount of time (which, admittedly, is pretty impressive). Of course, everything comes with a cost, and 7 Wonders is no exception. 

In 7 Wonders' case, the downside comes mainly in the form of [i]interaction[/i] -- or more accurately, the lack thereof. It is difficult to imagine why I would want to play a game with six other players when I only have the ability to interact with the two players adjacent to me. And that interaction is often overly subtle for my tastes. Burying a card in your Wonder to deny it to an opponent is a good strategic play, but it happens so quietly that it simply isn't [i]fun[/i]. And when the player count is >4, any ability to play strategically is also dramatically reduced, making each decision less meaningful.

Furthermore, every decision in 7 Wonders feels essentially the same and [i]feels like it carries the same weight[/i]. It is exceedingly rare, if it ever happens at all, that a turn poses a very difficult, fun decision -- a problem which is exacerbated when the player count reduces the ability to play with any semblance of strategy. Some games offer limited victory points, while others are classified as 'victory point buffet' games. 7 Wonders is an 'action buffet' game -- except all of the courses are the same. Compare this to Settlers of Catan, which offers the same choices every turn, but adds [i]noticeable tension[/i] because you are trying to make that key trade with another player that will help you advance your game. In 7 Wonders, your opponent just silently hands you some cards with an implied "Eh, just take one. I may have taken the one you need, but you'll never even know until the end."

Like Agricola, scoring is also a huge letdown, and is quite anticlimactic. Surely a ~30-minute game could have employed a scoring system that doesn't require a pencil-and-paper version of Excel. The scoring is balanced (perhaps overly so, to the point of being artificial), but uninspired and negative fun.

[url=http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/811970/theres-gotta-be-a-better-way]This review[/url] is an excellent summary of much of my feelings about 7 Wonders: [i][7 Wonders] fills a need that it had to create. ... Nothing about 7 Wonders serves any reasonable game function. Instead of a fun social experience, it offers a way to sit around a table of seven people and never have to speak to them. I can live with that in a game with fewer people, or a game that just felt more satisfying.[/i]

I don't mind playing 7 Wonders a bit, but I don't enjoy it as much as other games, and don't consider it to be nearly as good of a game as it gets credit for.

Card drafting for up to 7 players. A 30 minute forgettable filler.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Great game that plays as fast with 3 players as it plays with 7 (which is very rare). Probably the best drafting game out there and one of the better entry-level ones. I dislike the iconography a bit, it can seem scary for newer players. It's fine when you finnaly grasp it but it can be a pain at the start. Second thing, the cards that you build could be a little bit more complex (for example, green cards are pretty much the same in all three eras, red cards are just "+1 more sword" each era, blue cards are "more points than before" etc). the Guild purple cards are very interesting and I would like to see more of that, the gold ones are nice too. The game should be fine with the Cities expansion tho. It adds exactly what I think it needs.
Beside those 2 things I loved the game. It's fun, has a lot of ways to win, plays fast and has more theme that I gave it credit at the start (tho not as much as I would like). A very easy purchase in my opinion.

RATING: 3
First play. Suprised at how fast it plays. I felt pretty swamped by the options and didn't see the gobal picture at all. I'd be happy to play again but I really don't see what all the raving is about. Not sure I'd want to buy this.

Second play and I am left utterly cold by the experience. Its clear that its a game where success comes with knowing the decks and what is coming up. However the decisions are formulaic and limited and I felt bored by the lack of depth and non existant meaningful interaction between players. Rating dropped to a 4 for what is for me a soulless experience that I really do not want to repeat again.

Third Play: Struggling to find a filler for 6 at evening end I found myself at the table with this again. What I said after second play x 4. There are no informed decisions. You just decide whther a card gives you more points or stops your neighbour getting more. Just a really trivial numbing experience that I progressively dislike and down grade with each unpleasant outing.

What's great about 7 Wonders is it's so simple to learn and takes almost no time to play. The more you become familiar with it, the faster the game goes, and you'll end up playing several rounds a night. However, my issue with the game is simple. You could change the theme of 7 Wonders, name it anything else, and it would be the exact same gaming experience. Breeds of cats, ball clubs, auto manufacturers, etc. Completing your wonder, is so unfulfilling. And even with 7 different wonders available with slightly different modifiers, they somehow manage to give you the exact same experience, and won't change how you play the game. Honestly, nobody remembers the name of this game. It's simply referred to as "that quick one." But, like I said, that's exactly why this game's a winner. You don't have to invest a lot of time, thought or energy. And, with a little luck, you'll have several winners throughout the night. Not a bad thing, and keeps me reaching for it.

Fun drafting game that feels like Fairy Tale, with a civilization theme that while thin, adds for some neat mechanics and  depth. Which resources do you need?

A seemingly simple card game that provides tons of interesting choices!

Great game for larger groups. This game is simple to learn but has a lot of embedded strategy. The best part and sign of a well developed game, is multiple strategies work well so each game can lend itself to a different play style. A lot of cool elements (resource gatherning, building, some player interaction, etc.) for one game. It also plays quickly which is always a plus. This one can be played multiple times in a night.

RATING: 9
Fantastic, most likely deserving of a much better write up than I can muster here, exhausted from this years TN Game days, but I had to get this in the list and extol its virtues as best I could. This is without a doubt one to chase down and pay retail for if you have to in order to own it. from artwork to mechanics it all comes together and delivers a very satisfying experience. Building wonders, buying from your neighbor, even the way combat is not ignored,but not a major focus of this game, gives one a lot of of the sense of scale its trying to convey. Clever card passing mechanics are not new, but they are executed very nicely here, and for me at least, are a part of the draw of the game. Each decision is fraught with internal hand wringing as every great choice for this card has at least two others, and then that many that are bad. This process continues until just about the time to see where your neighbors really fit in, and then it all kicks it up a notch. It is an excellent way to spend time among friends, give it a try you will not be sorry!

7 Wonders is a a solid game with a multitude of fairly balanced paths to victory. I have seen players win with a strong focus on either science, military, or victory point cards. A mix of card types also seems to work, but diversifying does not seem to be as strong as specializing.

The wonders seem fairly balanced, and very rarely does one player take a run-away victory. The beauty of this game is that there is literally no down-time. Everyone plays at the same time. Occasionally one has to wait on other players to make a card choice, but this is minimal.

The biggest con to this game is the lack of player interaction. Very rarely does a player actively change his/her card choice based on other players's cards. Another small downside is that it takes some time to sort the cards at the beginning of the game when there is a different number of players between play sessions; however, compared to other games, setup time is still fairly short.

I look forward to trying the expansions that bring new mechanics into play. Overall, if I am looking for a quick game that accommodates up to 7 players, this is currently my game of choice.

Great fun. Feels like you're only playing with the two players beside you and it can be kind of chaotic but I'll play it anytime.

Raised my rating to a 10.  This is my favourite "light" euro.  If I was a boardgame "pusher", 7 Wonders would be the gateway drug I would use to establish my cartel.

Easy to learn, plays fast for all players counts due to simultaneous player actions which keeps the game moving.  Players can play off of each other, a variety of strategies, choices, and it feels different enough each game to keep it interesting.

The strong point of the game is that there is almost no waiting time for the players between rounds. In the entire game time, all players are involved without the need to wait for the others players to finish their rounds.

Rules are not to complicated. Around 15 mins of rules explanation. Maybe the first game will be a little confusing because not always the scoring is understood from the beginning, but after this, players start to enjoy it a lot.


Also, plays well with more players.

[url=http://ballearicus.blogspot.com/2012/01/7-wonders.html]7 Wonders[/url] es de esos juegos que cuando lo juego y a medida que la partida avanza, me empieza a dar un poco lo mismo lo que hagan los demás. Al principio miras un poco lo que se está bajando a la mesa, sobre todo tus vecinos. A medida que avanza la partida, la mesa empieza a llenarse de de cartas y la información te satura un poco. Cartas y cartas se apelotonan pese a intentos vanales de los jugadores por ser ordenados en la ubicación de las mismas. Siempre tengo la sensación de estar perdiéndome algo en alguna parte de la zona de juego. La sensación de “me da lo mismo lo que hagan” se agudiza a medida que avanza la partida, toda la atención se centra en que carta voy a bajar en este momento y como consigo los recursos necesarios para financiarla. 

Para el que suscribe, la perdida de interés por jugar a 7 wonders se intensifica en cada partida que juego. Esto no quiere decir que sea un mal juego. Solo quiere decir que no es un juego para mi. Me niego a pensar que uno de los juegos que ha estado en todas las quinielas, de todos los concursos del mundo, que es uno de los mas jugados y que mayores alabanzas a obtenido por la comunidad lúdica mundial en general hasta la fecha, pueda ser malo. Simplemente no es un juego para mi. Seguramente el no saber apreciar las deidades del juego es culpa mía.

I enjoy this game, though it's definitely not my favorite. I very much prefer it with 4, 2nd with 5P, and would pass at any other count if given the choice of another game to play. I've played it surprisingly well at the WBC (surprising to me) so I think I'll try and suck it up and see if I can get any better at it--- one in my group really enjoys it. I think playing with some of the expansion monuments would help reinvigorate my interest in it a little despite them not being present at the WBC. Need to get a copy for myself so I can check those out. It's been a little samey,and doesn't excite me really at all.  Still curious about Duel, mostly because of 2P nature and its presence at the WBC.

Interesting and very quick drafting game. Very good and flexible filler as it can be played with up to 7. There are some interesting decisions to be made in the game, but mostly the choices are pretty straightforward once you've chosen your strategy. Artwork and overall look of the game are superb. Quality of the components is lacking to put it mildly.

After some more plays I'm discovering some deeper game play. Esspecially the interaction between players is much more interesting than I initially thought. Seems there's more to this game after all.

Hype is a strange thing.  Sometimes it blows my expectations way too high, and other times it makes me dislike a game without even trying it.  In the case of 7 Wonders I think my expectations got a little out of control.  I love the drafting mechanism in Fairy Tale, and I love civilization-building games as well.  Then people talked about how it was easy to teach and could play with up to 7 players and I was absolutely chomping at the bit, expecting the next great game for my family.  So when I finally played it, unfortunately the only way for my excitement to go was down.

Now, don't get me wrong, it's a really fun little game.  However I didn't really feel the theme at all when playing.  It just kind of felt like we were playing cards.  And I didn't like that you have to have a significant amount of trust in the other players, not just that they're being honest, but that they understand when they can and cannot play a card.  I'm concerned that this will bog down with non-gamers and I'll spend a lot of time checking other peoples work.  Still, I want to get the game and try it with my family, but my excitement has dropped off significantly from where it was.

I like a game that plays so quickly and scales so well with more than 3. It comes across as light-hearted. Decision-making that is fun, sometimes tense, and a strange kind of controlled randomness that makes card games so appealing. The draft mechanic is the game's core reason for existence,  and its appeal. Of course it is.

Unrelated to 7 Wonders:

NOTE WHEN SCORING: a 7 is "usually willing to play" but if it's a 7 because it's relatively short, give it a 6.

Quick to learn, easy to play, not fiddley.  A great casual game.

Well, scoring at the end can be a little annoying.

My first vote was "9" as it played really smooth and nicely and brilliantly simple. I also felt as though i had a lot of options to choose from.

But after playing it 3 more times it became dumber every time i played it. I felt with every single game more that i don´t really have a choice what to do, because there is only one way of gaining points. There is no interaction or communication at all and you don´t have any idea what the other players are actually doing as everyone is playing just for himself.

The mechanism still is nice but i think that there is a better way to use it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fun and easy game that still requires at least some sort of strategy. Great to pull out as a filler with a large group.

One con is that it feels a bit random who wins. I'm not convinced that there is much depth with regards to strategy. But I guess one doesn't always need that.

Honestly, after a while this is a bit hit and miss for me. I won't ever turn down a game and if I'm tired then this is perfect, but it doesn't scratch that itch I have for depth in games.

RATING: 6
The big trend since Dominion has been "Deck-Building Games", which try to evoke the fond memories of MtG drafts, but have all been missing another important aspect - the drafting of cards.

7 Wonders brings back that wonderful feeling of card drafting that I enjoyed so much, as you pick a direction and try to bend your strategy that way.  And, much like MtG drafting, there are clearly superiour strategies (build up a solid resource base, or militia), but an inferior strategy (science) can win if it is under-drafted.  The "pick-and-play" mechanic means you can see everybody's strategies in action, making it much easier to decide your path, which makes the game very accessible.  I love the resource buying mechanic and the "competing only against your neighbour" simplifies a game that could get very complex with large numbers of players.  For such an intelligent mechanic, I'm surprised how simple it is to teach and learn.

Another thing I like - building on your wonder lets you hate draft and "bury" cards instead of passing them on, even if you can't use them, which is a lot of fun.  However, you can only do this a limited # of times and have to do some leg work first, or pitch it for a very small reward (3 coins).

Finally, the player boards allow some customization and encourage different players to pursue varied strategies.

I've played this with 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 players.  The game sings on 3-4, where you can apply some drafting strategy and reasonably expect to get cards back.  I enjoyed 5 as well.  6 was a bit of a luckfest, but still ok, and 2 was not worth your time.

7 Wonders is just a very intelligent game, with a lot of great ideas put together in an intuitive package, that furthermore plays quickly and isn't too heavy.  Thumbs up from me.

Card drafting game that has a lot going on. The game plays in a short amount of time, but the cards are so busy it's too difficult to know what's happening on the other side of the table let alone on each side of you. It's important to know to try and prevent opponents form prospering, but the makeu of this game doesn't allow for it so it minimizes strategy and loses it for me.

I like that it plays quick. I don't like that it feels a little too "group solitaire" in nature. I prefer the game at 3 players because I feel this gives each player the most control possible in affecting his or her opponents. I think at that count it really minimizes luck and allows for a deeper level of strategy by providing more opportunity to see the same hands passed around.

First play with 3 players went well.  Seems like there is a lot to like here with plenty going on but not too much to overwhelm for a short game.  In that respect, it reminds me of Glen More... very different games except that they both pack a good amount of game into a short, simple set of rules.  I still like this after my third play.  I'm seeing a few minor issues with the game like drafting inequality for neighbor players, but it is a fast game so I don't see that as a serious flaw.  I'll play it if someone wants to, but won't ask to play it.

Good game. A lot rests on the final round, though. Often hard to tell who is poised to win, which means you are running an independent strategy. If you play close attention, though, you can influence the table. If you are the only one doing it, however, you'll be quickly spotted as the Alpha.

A very well-made and balanced game. At first it seems like players don't have too much of an impact on the results, but a good knowledge of all the cards is needed to pick the correct card in each turn. It is quick and can be played in up to 7 players, but since everyone plays at once, it does not get slower with more players.

Love this game.

RATING: 4
A game I pass gladly over: it’s boring and usually played at hysterical speed, with no time to think about the card you’re to play.

Interaction is almost nonexistent: you just get some cards from the player before you, draw one of them and pass the remaining ones to the next player. Even trades (to be made with both said players only) don't require any talk but are performed quickly and silently, every player on his own: you need it, you pay it, you take it.

Finally, don’t even think the themed Wonders are central to the game: you usually finish to build them early in the game, the bad cards you received from the player before you being the only motivation.

Edit: after a few more plays, rating lowered from 5 to 4.

I usually enjoy this, although maybe it's taught me that card drafting is not my favorite mechanic. Specifically I don't enjoy situations like: the person to whom I'm passing is going for science, so I may have to spend the round building/burying science cards at the expense of my own plan.

Great game - don't need to say more than that.  Perfect for larger groups (or indeed smaller ones)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Advanced Fairy Tale, with different starting conditions/powers and a civ theme. Neat! Looks to play well with any number up to 7, as you only really interact with your immediate neighbors. (And there is a fair bit of that interaction besides just the card passing.) Only concern is that in a bigger game, you might as well be playing some other game than the person across the table from you. But, hey, what do you want from a game that plays 7 well? :) 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Absurdly enjoyable for serious gamers and casual gamers alike. Scales well, so a seven person game doesn't take longer than a three person game. A bit of a struggle to teach, but easy to play after one game.

RATING: 8
One of those games that is so perfect as-is I don't feel the need to add expansions that introduce complexity. It's great, fast, and absorbing as it is.

Admittedly when we have seven players and someone suggests this game, I'm now likely to hesitate, but only because I played it out. Just about a perfect design.

RATING: 8
Solid drafting game with a good progression arc--playing in the third age feels completely different than the first. Also interactive beyond merely hate-drafting, with military conflict and the ability to utilize your neighbor's resources. Scales well. That said, I think the base game would ultimately get a bit too same-y, even with the unpredictability of which guilds were in play. See my comments on Leaders for how the expansion fixes that.

RATING: 6
Kudos for innovative gameplay. However, it still relies inordinately on sheer luck. Picking a strategy or two is uncomplicated but if one hand happens to contain several of the cards you want, nothing can save you. Reversely, if 'your' cards are evenly spaced out among all hands, you will win the game easy. This is partly because you effectively have to live with your choices at the beginning of the game with little to no option to change your strategy.

Played once so far and loved it. I'm a huge fan of the card game Fairy Tale, especially the card drafting element. This is Fairy Tale+++ with a re-theme. There's more to keep track of, more choices to be made, and a small economic factor to keep track of.
 That re-theme is also important to me, because I've always had a hard time getting a game in a pink box called Fairy Tale to the table.
Love how this can be played in 25-35 minutes no matter how many you are playing with. 
Simple to teach and easy to understand. 
There are multiple paths to victory, and things get interesting when two or more players choose to go the same route. Can be played cutthroat, looking at what your neighbors are building and trying to deny them what they need, or can be played casually, with every player minding his own business.
Good for hardcore gamers, gateway gaming families, and even very casual game players.
With some more play I'll probably bump up the rating.  

Edit: Okay, I've played this a whole buncha times now, and my thoughts on the game have changed. I still think it's a fantastic game, and all the pros I mentioned in my original comment still hold true, but there is definitely some overhype here. It's fun to watch the game shoot up through the BGG rankings, but #1 family game and 14th overall? I don't think so.

Too light for my taste. Nothing serious strategy wise.
It doesn't press the players too. It's always 90% obvious what you have to do.

It may be fun for larger groups because larger groups don't really care about strategy, they just want to have a good time but for 2-4 people wanting to play a meaty game, 7 wonders is not worth it.

I like that it plays fast and it works with 2-7 players, though it is better with few people involved. What I don't get is the major hype. After a few plays, you have seen everything. There is not much strategy involved, since you only play the cards you randomly receive. Clearly overrated.

// Certainly my favorite game with the drafting mechanic.
Other games distill down the same thing, but I like the
civ/city-building theme of 7 Wonders more than, say, eating
Sushi. This is one of those games that may seem a little
overwhelming to a new gamer mostly due to the iconography,
but typically they'll have most of it figured out within
just a few rounds. Overall, this game is fast, has
interesting decisions, and is approachable for new gamers,
all of which are good qualities to have.

It's light and relatively fast, simple game. It's good as an introduction to board games and that's why it's so popular I guess. There is little interaction involved so everyone is building it's own engine. You can hate pick cards during the draft but since I mostly play it with beginners I won't do it ever. With more advanced players there are lots of more interesting games to play.
It's good - but I'm not super excited about it.

Ever wondered how its like to game with 7 people all at once? Give 7 wonders a try!

Little downtime with the card-drafting mechanic, lots of decisions and multiple victory paths. Although the only interaction is only with your neighbours, its still a race to see who has the best combination for their wonder!

Also, the game has good sturdy components with fantastic artwork!

RATING: 5.5
A fun game of card drafting and interacting with your "right and left" neighbors (ala Scream Machine).  The fact that it holds 7p and plays fairly fast (45 min) is great too!!

UPDATE: A good (not great) light-weight game that is almost entirely based on card-drafting (others in the genre are Notre Dame & Fairy Tale).  I would argue that it is not multiplayer solitaire because you can impact almost anyone at the table by denying them a card (e.g., burying it to build your Wonder)... but the game does feel a bit solitaire-ish since you can only have significant interactions with your immediate (left + right) neighbors.  I think the game would benefit from some kind of central competition like the national customers in the game Scream Machine (which has the same immediate neighbor interaction mechanic)... and it wouldn't surprise me if an expansion is in the works that fills this gap (perhaps a gladiator showdown or some kind of commerce goal cards?).

The fact that it holds 7 and plays fast is a big plus because it is a good game for bridging gaps during game days/nights when you are waiting for more people to arrive.

UPDATE #2: still my favorite card drafting game so far, but it's feeling more solitaire-ish than I would like.

Sure, card drafting is fun, and this game plays fast, but Pelopponnes is a far better "civ-lite" game.  In fact, not once have I felt like I was actually building a civilization in 7 Wonders... Basically you are card drafting to escalate VP generation in several different "tracks" of resource types.  There is definitely an advantage for the players who know the cards and can plan out future combos.  I'll definitely keep playing it, but it doesn't scratch that strategy game itch for me.

I enjoyed my first playthrough, although I felt a little out of my depth as I wasn't familiar with what the decks were likely to offer at each stage. I ignored the military side of the game and got punished for it in some ways, but invested heavily in inventions/engineering/the green things, and that would've been enough to win me the game - except for the big military player next to me, who managed to get a card in the last round that gave him loads of points for his neighbours having inventions/engineering things. Whoops. I think this is a game where it can be pretty uncompromising if played against experienced players, but I did enjoy it. I didn't *love* it, but it's something I'm interested in trying a few more times.

I can't think of any games that can play with such scalability, such a short playtime and such ease of learning while simultaneously packing so much in. It doesn't have the complex theme or epic quality of some games because no game that is played in 30 minutes by up to seven players will. What it is able to give you with so little cost is something that no other game I know can give you for the same investment. It is not likely ever to be the main attraction of a game day, but it probably the best filler game I've ever seen.

Edit: I've downgraded to an eight. I haven't been as enthusiastic to get this title out as I once was. I still think it's an outstanding game, but I am less convinced now that there is as much to explore as I once thought. This is quibbling, though. It's still a classic and I'm happy to play it, especially when I have four or more players in need of a filler.

Edit: It's now a seven. It occurs to me that every time there is the perfect time to get this game out I just don't want to do so. There seems to be more fussiness than actual decisions. It's not so much scaling as facilitating several three player games as much. It's still enjoyable, but the shine has worn off. It's a lesson for me, I think.

The Leaders expansions adds an amount of depth missing from the base game. I would rate this game lower, if not for the Leaders expansion. Overall, a good game that plays quickly. I expect it to become a more "complete" game with further expansions, but maybe I am expecting more from it than it can deliver.

- pleases everyone: younger and older players
- rules are easy (with expansions it is more difficult to play)
- one of the best card games on the market now IMO.
- strong theme

- next game syndrome (very strong)
- not expensive

I had to get rid of plastic organizer from the box to fit both expansions to keep them with the basic game - Leaders, Cities ;) 

MASTERPIECE! :)

Beautiful visual design and concept. It feels great to build up your city. 

Similar to Dominion in the central mechanic of "play cards that use my resources to either build more resource capacity, or cash in on my existing resource capacity". But unlike Dominion, the theme and card names make coherent sense, and there's some satisfaction in playing an impressive card with a cool design.

Excellent core game mechanic where everyone plays simultaneously. There is no negotiation, and all of this makes the game go quickly but always play a bit differently. 

I wish the player interaction were a greater part of the game, though; you don't have the same kind of "DDAAAAMMMNNN YYYOOOUUUU" moment you can have in Catan when someone blocks your growth. Decisions seem relatively easy each turn.

Winning depends on who has accumulated points in half a dozen different ways by the end, which is the way some other games, like Smallworld, work too. This preserves the sense that anyone might win, but it's anticlimactic and it means strategic decisions never feel high stakes.

So it's a great looking, accessible family game, if a little intimidating at first with its seeming complexity; it's really a very simple game. Fun and light, and a real challenge to beat a clever player.

Of course, the real test is how often my kids ask to play it, which is often!

One of the best card driven games I've played.

7 player game: Won with military might and Strategist's Guild which gave me 11 victory points with my neighbors having 11 -1 tokens

5 player game: Alexandria. Won with Science and Civilian buildings. +10 point guild for grey cards to the sides.

4 player game: Won with 15 civilian + 14 guild pts.

3 player game. 51 pts. Mostly Civilian. came in 2nd to guy who did Science with 53 pts.

3 player game: 67 pts. Rhodes. Won with mostly Military and guild cards.

4 player game: 52 pts. Alexandria. Won with balanced approach.

5 player game. 79 points. Gizah. Won mostly with Military 12 points, Guilds 17 points, and the Wonder 20 points. Second place through 5th place had 51 points to 48 points.

Just couldn't get into this.  A little too much for the non-gamers to handle and a bit too light for the veterans.  I think this has a very nice meta-game, once everyone knows all of the cards, but it just doesn't get to the table enough for that.  I will say I do like the 2-player variant in this game, but I own Duel.

A beautiful card drafting filler with cheeky amounts of interaction that consistently ends in tasteless scoring.

I really liked the idea, might need to play it more, but it felt silent and singular, like the common complaint of Group Solitaire. Playing with a group that actually and competitively considered the tableaus of other players wasn't much better, either, especially when playing with seven players and it was rather impossible to see those of the players across the table.

Card drafting, set collection and tableau building card game. Players choose a card from a starting hand to play and pass the rest to the right (or left depending on the round). After picking up the hand you've been passed, you select another card to play and keep passing until you've played six cards for the round. There are several ways to concentrate points, and tracking the cards as they progress about the table is a skill that will have to be developed to do consistently well. Ideally you are pursuing a line of play different from your neighbors so as to avoid trying to collect the same types of cards.  

I very much like the card drafting mechanic and see a possible application of it to Agricola for the Occupation and Minor Improvement cards at the beginning of the game. Another big plus is the low downtime and how well the game scales from two to seven players. Amazingly (baring players with a bad case of AP), the overall playing time is relatively unaffected by the number of players!

The swiftness of the play, yet with decent depth, makes this game an awesome filler. Definitely a keeper - I think this is going to be hard to displace from the top of the list of our filler favorites.

Provisional rating - I like it

Not sure how much replayability there is here - the card pool is rather limited and you get it in 'ages'

I like drafting games so this helps - it's good as a filler, and goes to 7 which is great. I wouldn't want to play it all evening though.

As a 'civ-light' game I'd rather play Peloponnes. For draft, I think I prefer Fairy Tale but 7 Wonders is easier to explain, easier to play and easier to score ...

Constant action keeps this card drafting game moving and fun. It's a little hard to teach to non-gamers because you have to cover all the different types of cards and that takes a while. However, one complaint I have is that you only interact with your immediate neighbors.

This is a really solid drafting game, that is really quick to play.  Even though it is on the easier side, I think it is still just a touch above gateway.  Most new people seem really overwhelmed by the game at first and this can put them off.  I think introducing them so something like Sushi Go first would be a much better option - although even that game the drafting can confuse people who do not understand how to draft.  

Overall I think 7 Wonders is a great second tier game.  This is what I base my rating on.

Great Game, quick to play, lots of fun, and quite gorgeous looking.   Limited strategy for beginners, and it is hard not to simply take Science all the time as it earns huge points.  So I found that there was limited options and direction in the base game.

The Leaders expansion adds those options and direction.  It is a must have for 7 Wonders fans.   The leaders provide you with bonuses for certain aspects of the base game.  So you have something to work towards.   I cannot see myself ever playing it without Leaders.

The drafting cards aspect is a nice touch to give you actions to do for all players at the same time. The cards are all labeled for the number of players for ease of setup and solid cards for all players. it has fantastic replay value but see cities EXP to affect players a bit more and adding little random to the draws. Once players know how to play this game you can finish a game in under 20 mins. That is one of the reasons along with the replay-ability is why this game is played a lot in our house.

The best feature? It plays fast. I know there is no downtime and a lot of strategies. Could be true but I think this is a sort of solo game. Everybody tries to get the most from the cards they draw, but there is no interaction among players. This is one of the worst drawbacks for a game, i think. Still nice to play, just because it's fast but certanly not a true masterpiece as it's ranking could suggest.

I was going to get this for Xmas but they sold out. I'm pretty glad they did, actually. Our friends acquired it and though it's nice to play as a lighter option, the strategy is quickly grasped. I'd say its even lighter than Dominion, whose niche I would put it in as a quick, light, easy to learn game. 
Production values are middling, but the art is good. It's fun, but not THAT fun, and I'd certainly rather play Agricola any day of the week and twice on Sundays.

7 Wonders poses as a light gateway game, but winds up being just a little bit long to teach to non-gamers, but too simple for gamers to really enjoy.  It is a bit of a one trick pony - once you get the hang of valuing the cards, the draft almost plays itself.  But the draft is the whole game.  So there's not much there.  

We played this one about 5 times before it was played out.  At this point, I would play it if others wanted to, but would not ask for it or recommend it myself.

I like drafting games and I study the ancient world as my day job, so you'd think I'd be into 7 Wonders. But after at least 5 plays with various friend groups, I just don't really see it. The game feels thin and random; the theme feels tacked on, a mishmash of ancient cultures that have nothing to do with one another. For a light drafting game I'd much prefer Sushi Go!, which is smaller, cuter, and easier to explain.

This will be either a 7,8, or 9 depending on further plays. Cards are nicely done and are easy to interpret, so it gives the non-gamer crowd a chance to grasp their significance. In my first play, I didn't think the choices were too difficult, but the selection of card play is interesting, as one has to consider his two neighbors in both what he plays and what he passes to his right or left neighbor. UPDATE: Already upgrading to a 9 with my second play. The boys enjoyed this as much as myself on their first play - quite an accomplishment. High hopes for this now. UPDATE: Now a 10, with both the Cities and Leaders expansions, with a medium/heavy rating due to the plethora of card icons to learn.

7 Wonders is a fun card drafting, tableau building game. Probably the biggest selling point is that if everyone knows how to play the game, you can easily play in 30 minutes (even with the full 7 players).

BUT it is not the gateway game I was hoping it to be. It can be a bear to teach because of all the symbols. My friend who plays games at my place and has played complex games like War of the Ring and A Game of Thrones Board Game struggled immensely with 7 Wonders.

But overall 7 Wonders is a fun game that I don't see ever leaving my collection. Every turn is packed with meaningful decisions and it is not as multiplayer solitaire as a game like Dominion; you really need to look at your neighbors and pay attention to what they may pass you, what you don't want to pass to them, and what resources they have.

I highly recommend 7 Wonders, but not as a gateway game. Play Sushi Go! first with non-gamers.

RATING: 8
After my first play, this game continued to grow on me.  I found the player interaction and resource management fascinating.  There is a learning curve for new players due to all the symbols, but once that's mastered the game plays very fast.  I would have enjoyed it more if I had some time to explore the cards, instead of being thrust into the game by other players.  The different paths to victory (military, scientific, buildings) keep the strategy interesting, as well as the the numerous leaders and the 7 different wonders themselves.  I may have to pick this one up.

A very good, intelligent filler. Too random with lots of players, I think. I'd like to try it with only 3 or 4, so I can see some cards come back to me, can manage to be careful about what other folks are collecting, and can actually build a strategy for my game.

   7 Wonders is a great game in terms of its presentation, playability, and scalability.  Easily the top ranked game in our household, my only regret is that we do not play it as much as we should.

   The deployment of cards on the basis of inherent resource values attributed to other cards / civilizations is a great alternative to exchanging physical tokens for resources - something that new players might struggle a bit with, but that an introduction to a lighter game like Splendor might alleviate.

7 Wonders is one of the games from the 2010 crop with staying power, if only because 7-player games that can finish in 30 minutes are exceptionally rare. Gameplay is nothing extraordinary but pleasant enough for gamers and non-gamers alike. Card sleeves are a must - the card stock ranks amongst the worst I have seen.
----------------------------
The Leaders expansion gives it a welcomed strategic dimension.
----------------------------
Rating for a 5-6 player game. I prefer to play with 3 players because you get to pick two cards from the initial hand, and that is what a draft is all about.

Played four player and all had a good time. Seemed lighter than I had predicted. I won the first game (by a point), and this is usually not a good sign for repeated playability. Losing seems to motivate me!

RATING: 7
Based on one play Essen 2010.

The number 1 game on Fairplay at Spiel 2010.

It´s a card drafting game. If you play with the card drafting variant of Agricola, then you know what this game will feel like.

On the plus side, 7 players with instruction included got this done in 75 minutes. I think 4 experienced players can get this done in 40 minutes.

Update:
Even with AP players, it only takes 25 minutes to play. An okay filler. The deck gets tired fast though even after 3 plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Fast card drafting game with cool theme. I played a prototype of the final game and am thus not able comment on the component quality.

Definitely a must for those who enjoy card drafting and a solid game for everybody else too. I'm not a huge fan of neither card drafting but I gladly play the game another time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Played 7 times.  I'm getting the hang of this more and more, starting to make decisions based on what's going on with my opponents.  I really like the booster draft mechanic in this game.  It manages to provide a rich game experience in building up your civilization in just 20 or 30 minutes, tops.

My rating of 9 corresponds to play with 4 or 5 players.  With 3, 6, or 7 players I rate it an 8.

I get that this is something of a puzzle and after a while it's likely to be optimized and not as much fun, but I predict that getting to that point will be a blast.  Plus there is the Leaders expansion out now, which I will get if the base game ever starts to get stale.

I can guess that this won't last too long without an expansion (as much as I hate to say that).
However - it'll be fun while it lasts! Unique (it's been done before but card drafting has never been so much fun!) multiplayer format of civilization building. Light yet strategic enough to be tough(ish). Enjoy the ride!

Verrrrrrry addicting.

Up there with Carcassonne, Ticket to Ride, Dixit and King of Tokyo - all great games to attract casual and non gamers and still meaty enough for us (we know who we are :p )

EDIT: When teaching the game I always ask them to stick with it until the scoring phase. That's when it all becomes clear and their faces illuminate. First game is always a drag, it gets so much better afterwards though that it's worth it :)

RATING: 10
The drafting mechanic makes a great game for up to 7 players (or 8 with the City expansion.) All players can act in parallel which keeps the downtime minimal. The downside is that there is almost no direct interaction with the other players, except for war with your neighbors.

I prefer the game with 3-5 players, because with more players you cannot observe what all of the other players are doing, you cannot take into account all the cards that are in play and the other players' strategies. And you basically only get to see each hand once, so you cannot hope for a card to wheel. With 6-8 it feels much more luck-driven and multi-player solitaire than with less players.

So much fun! I thought this would just be another Dominion but its not. It is completely different and a ton of fun. I love the dynamic of the different strategies. Should you battle? Just go for victory points? Build your wonders? Great game and it also moves very quickly and is relatively easy to learn, so having a top notch game like this that only takes about 30 minutes is a true find.

RATING: 9
Nice, simple rules and yet engaging gameplay. Not usually a fan of drafting, but this is a great drafting game. Want to buy now. Plays very quickly once you know the rules, and the wealth of wonders (each one is double-sided) means you rarely play the same game twice.

After having had the game explained better to me I like it a lot more. Sure, the game is more about maximizing opportunities, but you also have to keep an eye on what your two neighbors are doing.

I like it.  The rules are clean and simple, the play is fairly quick.  It's a nice light game.

I think the hype is a little unusual though, because there really isn't a whole lot to this game.  There are limited paths to victory (greens are all or nothing, for example), and games seem to get a little boring.   It feels like a game badly in need of expansions.

Appropriately 7 Wonders gets a 7.

Jan 2011:  Upped to an 8, after it plays far better than I thought with a larger number of players.  Still enjoying it and would like to add this to my collection.

Surprisingly engaging.  Easy to learn, lightning quick, but decidedly more strategy than might be expected.  Plays well, but quite differently, with different player numbers.  Even the two-player variant keeps the same feel.  (Nonetheless, kudos to the publisher for listing it as 3-7.)  I do wish the cards were a bit sturdier, but they're really beautiful.

Update 2/2012: I may have overplayed this a bit.  I still like it, but I'm almost never the one suggesting it now.  It's still an awesome achievement -- easy to teach, works with a wide range of player numbers, and plays incredibly quickly.  But there are a lot of games I'd rather play.

This is the game I always play with my French friends whenever I get to meet with them. They love the game even more than I do, and play even more, I never seem to be so victorious with them! The theme is not really important but the gameplay is super fun! I love the drafting. I love the set collection aspect. I love building those wonders. The game really shines with all the extensions in my opinion: yes even with the rage-inducing Babel. Love it!! Keep in mind it might be a bit tricky to teach, beginner usually don't pay attention to 'playing twice the same card' on their tableau, and there are TONS of symbols to remember, but I think the iconography is good enough it is reasonably manageable.

Tried this with 5 friends at Bastard Café in Copenhagen. Gorgeous artwork doesn't make up for a tiresome gameplay. It has a solitaire feeling as you are just passing cards and taking the one(s) you need to complete wonders and score points.

I would never invite friends over and say "Hey, come over for a 7 Wonders game night." I would probably play it as a filler between other bigger games.

[b]7 Wonders[/b] is a pretty simple card game that uses  drafting as its primary game mechanic. It's good, but the game didn't come with enough variety of cards, and I feel the games are getting a little repetitive already.  It is pretty obvious that the game was designed around releasing many expensive expansions.  Also, the game comes in a huge box, whereas a box 25% the size would have sufficed. I guess they didn't want you feel ripped off by the price tag.

RATING: 7
With 2, the game has the most control, as the hands move back and forth, so you see the "other" hand every other turn.  What complicates this is the dummy player - unlike with 3 or more, he doesn't have a hand that rotates, but one that comes out a card at a time.  Thus, you'll know what cards are where, but there is a small amount of doubt as to when those cards you haven't seen will show (one of them won't).  You can use the dummy player to enrich yourself and/or screw your opponent, so there's more strategy than with 3+.  This is a fun, fast game, but no matter how you play, no terribly deep.  Great filler, sadly at non-filler prices.  If you pick this one up, be sure to get some sleeves - every Repos game I've owned has had cards that show wear after only a few plays.

There's enough going on here to make a gamer happy for the 30 minutes it takes to play the game. Nothing earth shattering, but a good, solid, quick game. The real bonus is the number of players supported. Since everyone takes their turn at the same time, the game takes ever-so-slightly longer with more players as there is typically at least one player with AP in the group. But with people who know the game, it's a 30 minute party-game-for-gamers.

I would love to play with folks with lots of experience, as I have only played with at least 2 new players each time I have taken a seat with this one.

Nice, light, smooth, civ-building card game - the card equivalent of Roll Though the Ages and fills a similar spot.  A lot to admire in the super-streamlined design that can cope with seven without slowing unduly.

We have really liked this when we can get a 3rd or 4th player. The 2 player variant was not very fun due to the time having to be spent playing the dummy player. Hopefully 7W: Duel will be a better 2 player option.

:thumbsup: [b]POSITIVE POINTS:[/b]

++ Great, light-medium weight strategic engine-building card drafting game, with smooth gameplay, with many paths to victory.
++ Great scaling between all player counts, by adding more cards. The official "expert 2-players" variant works very well and makes the game more strategic in my opinion (but takes longer to play and affect the gameplay smoothness). 
++ Great replayability from the variable card draft mechanism, the variable player's Wonder Board used (plus side used, A or B), the limited number of Guild used in the last Age (purple cards), the number of players and your neighbors strategy used during the games.
++ Easy to teach, fast to set-up and fast to play (even at high player's count when players know how to play).
++ Great game insert which hold everything in an orderly fashion (base game and expansions, but to put everything in the core game box, you'll need to get rid of it unfortunately).
++ Great card graphic design, that is clean and clear.
++ There are expansions available for this game (which is useful to refresh the game when we have overplayed it).
++ The Leaders expansion really add a layer of depth and possible long-term strategy without adding bulk to the base game, as it's essentially just a pre-game draft (to choose our leaders) and then, just one more action per age to do (recruit a leader).
++ The Leaders expansion is also the best kind of expansion in the sense that you can easily decide to play with it (or not), with minimal setup and take-down time.
++ The Cities expansion add more interaction between all the players around the table (and not just your neighbors anymore) by including the black cards. This add a 7th round in each Age, which does add some variability to the game when you have played it a lot (This expansion is best with more players).


:thumbsdown: [b]NEGATIVE POINTS:[/b]

-- Take a lot of table space (beyond 5 players, a normal kitchen table may be not enough!).
-- The replayability in 2-players game can be a bit lower (for the base game only), but is still really high with expansions (especially Leaders).
-- Even though the official "expert 2-players" variant work well and is more strategic, it take longer to play it than a 3+ players game.
-- The components between the base game and the expansions (and between the expansions themselves) have slight color mismatch, thus it easy to know that some cards are from an expansion or not.
-- It seems like the expansions are a bit expensive for what we get (especially the Wonder Pack), but if you really like the base game, they are still worth it.
-- Using the Cities expansion add a bit of setup time as we now need to include black cards equal to the number of players for each Age deck.
-- Using the Cities expansion also add too much randomness and chaos to this well balance game (for low player counts). The 7th round also lengthen the game.

The complicated scoring makes it hard to parse the good plays from the better plays.  The tight scoring at the end makes it critical to eke out that extra point or two, but it's hard to tell early on exactly what will do that.  If this game were more like Dominion, merely an efficiency race for simple VPs, I would rate it higher.  No game should take longer to score than to play.

14 plays - not bad - but I think I've hit that point where I'm not enjoying it that much anymore. Apart from the niggling issues of balance and control, I think probably 7 Wonders biggest problem is that the pacing and narrative are wrong. High-stakes decisions are made early with inadequate information, and rather than build to a conclusion 7 Wonders actually becomes less and less interesting, and the game drains tension, with each passing age, until the 3rd Age when almost all the decisions are automatic and little you do matters. Which is a shame. There are of course reasons to break the rules of narrative structure, but you need to really know what you're doing if you want to change things up. I don't think 7 Wonders does.
---
Having now gotten a significant number of plays of this under my belt, I like it. It's great that it packs a fair amount of interest into a 30-minute game that easily scales to 7. But ... I can't shake the feeling that there is less here than meets the eye. Once people get the hang of the game it seems like scores become very clustered (a recent game was 52-51-49-48), which is not really  a good sign. Or, the game can be decided by some guy who never builds any Military and allows a neighbor to score a ton of points off of a single 1-point military card. Given there isn't much depth the underlying game here, it's rather chromy, and it feels like your fate is as much in the hands of others as it is your own - Military and Science can both be swingy. Still, it has many good qualities as well, it's clever and fast and fun and flavorful and colorful, and I expect to be enjoying it for a while.
---
Played twice at BGG.con, fun, but a bit over-hyped. It's a nice medium-weight that plays very fast but doesn't pack the punch of, say, a Beowulf, Blue Moon City, San Juan, Race for the Galaxy, or even Small World. It seems clear that it's going to become pretty samey pretty fast. But it does play fast, and does cleanly support 6-7 players, which is huge - nothing else in my collection keeps 6 or 7 players as engaged and moving as quickly on a game with some substance. This alone will assure it a spot in my collection for some time, I imagine.

I'm really curious as to whether there is a "life extension" plan for expansions for the game. Clearly it'll need something if it's to rise above disposability. Also clearly, new player mats aren't going to do it; we'll ultimately need more variety and range in the decks. The path forward is not entirely clear.

As Modern Art is a distillation of auctions and Can't Stop is a distillation of push your luck, 7 Wonders is a distillation of take-and-pass drafting. I'm always surprised it gets so much love for being original since Fairy Tale did a lot of the same things. That said, I think 7 Wonders is a better game, especially with the expansions.

Definitely one of those "let's play one more time!" games, which is actually fairly rare in our group.  A lot of that is simply because the entire game takes 20 minutes, but within that 20 minutes is a very interesting game!

7 Wonders reminds me a lot of Fairly Tale, with the "play a card and pass the rest" mechanism.  However, 7 Wonders adds quite a bit of depth to the system, as you now have to pay even more attention to your neighbors and how you interact with them.  And this added depth doesn't come at the expense of much added complexity, which is great!

I also enjoy how each player starts with a different wonder, which will sometimes slightly drive your game strategy.  I actually wish they drove your strategy a little more heavily, but it's a nice touch as it is.

Overall, a great little filler that feels like a full game, and plays 7 to boot which covers a hard to fill niche!  My only concern is with staying power, as games start to feel very same-y a few plays in.  For a "one more time" type game, it really needs to feel different from game to game, which I hope future expansions address.

plays quick and is simply a deck drafting game. You pick a card and pass the remainder to the person next to you. I suppose you can end up in a little microcosm of only paying attention to the players immediately next to you.

The starting point for drafting games. Games takes 3 rounds, with some variation in the cards in round 3. Very fun game, but can be somewhat difficult to understand what you're actually doing (what to keep and give away/use otherwise). I really like drafting in Magic the Gathering (the pinnacle game for drafting imo) and this game is one of the best in its genre (without paying lots of money every time you'd like to play, in contrast to MtG).

Love this game.  Have now taught it about 5 times.  Just short in complexity to be a 9 now - though elegance may get it there soon.

Advanced to a 10 (August 14th, 2013).  This has become a favorite of my family.  We spent a lot of money at Staples to get fairly professional looking sets of the Lost Wonders and we love the Cities expansion.  Play at least two times every time I visit them.

We have been playing this a lot with our group. We really enjoy it and the expansions. We are using it to introduce gaming to friends as well. We tried the 2 player variant and found it lacking. made our own where we each control two wonder boards and use the conflict rules from Cities Team Play. Was a lot of fun. 

update again:
Still hits the table often and is enjoyed by everyone we teach it to ]. By far one of our favorite games.

RATING: 5
An ok game that is way overrated and doesn't quite work for me.

I dislike 7 Wonders for several reasons, but one thing which really bugs me about the game is that it doesn't teach me how to get better, rather, it obfuscates strong play. Not that I've played the game a huge amount, but in my few plays I never felt like I was developing skill or understanding what the game really wants me to do. It's kind of point-salady but because it's simultaneous and disconnected and I can't quite figure out what decisions my opponent's made and can't understand how they built up more points than me. Sure, someone may have some awesome combo but how did they get to that point, what thought processes went into what resources they took, etc. 

It also suffers from very little and localized player interaction.  In a 7 player game it doesn't feel like you're playing with the majority of players.

Very good, fast game for 3-7 players, although the price is too high. Theme doesn't matter, and cards could have standard size.

The special rules for 2 players are ok, but the best is to play with 3-5 players.

Solid game. A little heavier than a gateway game because of the scoring. Plays surprisingly fast, even at large player counts, because of the simultaneous card draft.

This is a nice enough game when you want something quick that doesn't involve TOO much thought. This gets a lot of play with us for the simple reason that it scales really, really well. And even though I'm sort of played-out of the game by this point, I'm still up to play just because it's so fast.

Even though it scales well, I think I prefer this game with a lower player count (three is my favorite). There's a little more strategy involved when you know you're passing the same decks back and forth, and it makes for some tenser choices.

I have a problem with this game, though, and that's that it's quite difficult to interfere with other players. I enjoy plenty of low-interaction games, but the drafting makes it feel like you should be able to stop someone who's running away with the win, but unless everyone is cooperating it's really hard to do and often doesn't feel worth it.

Luck of the draw is obviously a big factor as well. You only win if you pick a plan early game and stick to it, and that's hard to do when you might just get bad pass after bad pass. But in a light, breezy game like this it's not really a big deal. Don't treat this like the serious game it isn't and it's fun enough.

Update: I really don't care for this game anymore. What was once a middling experience is now irritating. If someone goes uncontested Sciences, they win. So someone always has to fall on the sword and contest Sciences - usually letting another player just play for points and sneak in a win. I will play it when everyone wants to play because it's so short, but I'd be more than happy to never play again.

You have to control a third city every other turn and it makes the game a lot slower and kind of ruins the idea of the game. But if you like a challenge it's certainly entertaining if you are only two people. 

The theme of the game is ancient middle-east and nothing special really. This game would be better with more humor. Buying rocks is limited fun.

This game is awesome. It introduced me to drafting, a mechanic I now love. Lots of paths to victory, lots of choices to make. It's a bit multiplayer solitaire, but I won't knock it too badly. Also awesome in that it doesn't scale time with more player: 4 player takes almost the same time as 7. I will always like this game.

As much as it pains me to bandwagon-jump, you have to give it up for a simple game that plays quickly and ably handles 3-7 players. That fills a pretty sweet niche. I don't think its very deep strategically at all, and it's a bad sign that after my first play I didn't berate myself over all of the things I should have done differently. It's pretty straightfoward. But did I mention simple, fun, thematic, plays fast and handles up to 7? 

Edit: I have to amend to say that after playing with various player numbers, I think this only really plays well with 3 or 4. That said, I think - despite the large box - it's unfair to judge this as anything but a filler, and it works really well as that.

I have played this game 50+ times and it hasn't gotten old yet. It is a great game and is usually the first one out on our board game nights.

1/3/18: since I wrote this the game has gotten quite old so I bumped it down from an 8 to a 7. I think I'll keep it in my collection though since there are not many games that play so quickly regardless of player count. I still like the game but the strategy is not that deep and there arent many interesting decisions to be made.

Very nice and rather quick game. We usually play 2 player with Cities and Leaders (soon also Babel). We vastly prefer the 2 player variant over the regular "more than 2 players" game, as it allows for a much more focused and strategic/tactical game.

The amount of fun this game is is directly relational to the amount of time it takes to play. The faster you go, the more fun it is. Make sure you have a good strategy for teaching the rules. Lay out all the different cards first and give people a chance to look over and ask questions.

Most definitely a great filler. The biggest asset of 7 wonders is of course that it can accomodate 7 players and provides with real decision making in a very short time frame.

This is obviously not the best card game out there or th best civ-building game either, but one has to recognize the elegance of the design and how much it accomplishes in such a short time frame for so many players.

A must have in one's library.

RATING: 8.5
This is a great game. It plays extremely fast (around half an hour) and plays 3-7 player in ALMOST exactly the same way - and in the same time!

It's a good light civilization card game which I think fills a unique niche; I cannot really compare 7 Wonders to many other games. The symbols and how the ressources work can be hard for newcomers to figure out at first, but once they have tried a game, they know what to do the next time - which will probably be right after the first game as it's such a fast game! 

Even though it's a fast game, you actually feel that you are building your own small civilization, especially because of your own unique wonder (which are all pretty well balanced, and I like how there are 2 different sides to choose from). 

When playing with 3 players there is much less luck as you will get your starting hand back and everybody have access to the same starting ressources and influence each other militaristic. If you are playing with 6 or 7 players, there is more luck involved as you never know which cards will be passed to you by your neighbour, but I don't mind this aspect. 

Regarding strategy, I think that the different paths are pretty balanced though it does seem that, in our games, the blue civil cards have been granting the most VPs, but the green scientific cards and red military cards have won their fair share of games too. A good mix of the different cards can be okay too sometimes, but it really depends on how many players you are, which wonder you have and which cards you are dealt etc., so you cannot declare a superior strategy... I also like the guild cards and how they are mixed into the deck randomly.

The expansion adds a little something different to the game and I can't wait to see the rest of the expansions. The promo wonders Manneken Pis and Catan are okay wonders but not some I use when playing with fewer than 5 players.

This is one of those games you want to have in your collection. I recommended it a lot - not many games can play 7 players like this in 30 minutes!

My recommended number of players: 3, 4, 5
Best with: 4

Great filler game with some strategic decision-making compressed into 21 cards.  I find the somewhat abstract resource concept is a bit difficult for non-gamers to understand, though, so I think it's unlikely I'll use it as an intro game again.  ... seemed pretty simple to me.  :)

The first time I played this game, it was unlike any other game I had ever played.  Love the drafting mechanic and multiple paths to victory.

Expansions definitely make it better, but it is difficult to teach the game with Leaders and Cities to a new player so I don't get to play them as much as I would like.

Definitely one of the games that got me interested in modern board gaming.

I have played this game with many expansions, combinations, and groups of people. I just think it's a great design of a game, and innovative, even if it's not the first drafting game. The lack of interaction of players that are not "neighboring" is the games biggest fault, but I still like the game. The addition of the Babel expansion adds more interaction, so the option is there. I really don't think there's another civilization type game out there that can accomplish what this game offers in the 30 minute time frame, especially with a high player count. It's a permanent addition to my closest because it's so easy to pick up and play, it's fun, and it plays quick!

A very quick and well designed card game.  Definitely NOT a multi-player solitaire as a lot of card-based board games tend to be (I am thinking of you Dominion, and you, London) as much of your scoring throughout the game is dependent on what others are doing.  

My wife claims the Wonders are unbalanced, but I don't know if I agree.  Some are better than others, but I think you have to cater your strategy to the Wonder that you get at the beginning of the game, rather than being stuck with one particular strategy.

7 Wonders is a great, quick game for a larger group. It can probably seem a little overwhelming at first, but I think most will be able to get a good grasp of it with one play-through. It *does* offer rules for a two-player variant, but it's fairly clumsy, and a far superior two-player version has since been released in 7 Wonders Duel.

A very fun game, and my favorite of the drafting games.  It can be a challenge to learn and teach (it takes about 15 minutes), but it is straightforward and intuitive once you pick it up.  It scales nicely to bigger groups, meaning it doesn't take much more time to play with six people than it does with four.

Is more fun with expansions; I have tried the "Babel," "Cities," and "Leaders" expansions.  I do not recommend teaching the game with the expansions, but they are worth it for experienced players.  I love the Babel and Cities expansions; I am just so so on the Leaders expansion.

Finally had to up my 7 rating to 8 because I really do love this game.  I think this is ok though since I bought the Manneken Pis promo, technically I have 8 wonders.  

This was my first experience with the card draft idea and like how it normalizes the burn of a bad hand or the advantage of a great one.  I don't know what it is about the actual game play that I like but I always enjoy playing it.  It's a great quick playing game that plays a whole bunch of people.

7 Wonders is one of the most versatile games that I have in my collection. It plays from 3 up to 7 players with no issues, it  makes great use of the drafting mechanic, and it typically plays in about 30 minutes. It is… “The Superfiller!”

And that’s a key point. This game does not offer the substance of, say, Puerto Rico, or Agricola, or etc. etc. And I’m OK with that. Every time I’ve sat down to play this game, I’ve enjoyed it. Waiting for others to show up? Bust out a game of 7 Wonders. Have 30 minutes to squeak in one last game? Bust out 7 Wonders. The only issue with the game is teaching “newbies” the iconography on the cards. But once they overcome that initial barrier, the game flows very smoothly.

A couple notes--I actually prefer playing this with less players, as you can see the hands of cards twice in a phase and try to anticipate what you will see again. Also, with groups larger than 4, you really need to police everyone’s turn. Otherwise, a few get ahead of themselves and then it’s a mild train wreck to fix. It's a 7 rating for 6 or 7 players, but an 8 at anything less.

Update: I ultimately ended up trading this one away. My resistance to playing with more than 5 players, coupled with the fact that I can think of more enjoyable "superfillers" for 3 to 5 players meant this just wasn't hitting the table. Too many times I felt victim to simply not getting a critical card because it was never passed my way. It just wasn't fun!

Decisions, decisions... Choosing the right card can be so hard! Or surprisingly easy, but sometimes that's not a good sign...

The box is too big for its contents and badly designed. This is basically a card game with smallish "wonder" boards, so they could have stored everything vertically in a box slightly taller but half the width, or kept the same size box and have room to store the expansions with the base game. Lame!

Very short but very intense game. All you need to do is  to gather the most victory points and you can gather them by several ways. In every turn you may do couple of actions and every action will bring you victory points. The trick is to choose actions that will give you more VP than other players. 
This game is very good with 3 and with 7 players. There are at least 5 different strategies that you can choose.

One of the hot new card games that I think would fit in well with my collection and game group.  From what I've read, there's not a ton of player interaction (otherwise known as "take-that"), which I view as a good thing.  This is something my wife and other casual gamers would enjoy.

[b][u]Update[/u][/b]: Introduced this to my game group, and after the first game everyone immediately wanted to play it again.  And a 3rd time. We still haven't figured out all the strategies yet, but it's good fun, a very interesting game, and doesn't take too long (30 minutes).  This looks like a big hit already.

At first, I thought it was amazing. But on subsequent plays, I find myself more and more bored by repeated drafting and nothing else. Could easily be the most overrated game in the top 20.

RATING: 6.4
Cool concept for a game.  I have a little problem with the lack of interaction and how little you can affect what someone else is trying to do.  It seems like once you get to the 3rd age especially, it's better to just work on maximizing your own civ rather than waste the action trying to affect someone else.  Might be fixed with an expansion.

Slightly on the fence for this one. I love the fact that it plays quick and that you - usually - cannot tell who's winning until after the last round. On the other hand, it might be a little too quick and random? For now, I like it, but I can see this getting old quickly. Also, it's pretty pricey for what you get...

Just got this for Christmas.  So far, I have played with 2, 3, and 4 players.  I enjoyed it with 4 players the most, can't wait to try a full 7-player game!  It's a fun, fast-paced game, I would definitely recommend giving it a try! **edit** played 6 players, and holy crap, it's awesome!

After six plays, I have enjoyed myself playing this game, but it's a very different experience with the different numbers of players.  Still trying to wrap my head around it.  But it seems like there's a good mix of luck and skill, and it will probably see the table since it has a relatively short playing time and can handle lots of players.  But I'm really not sure how to play well yet.

Easy to learn, plays fast, and there are numerous ways to win.  This is a staple of my gaming group's collection and it's pulled out almost every time we get together.  Highly recommended.

Edit (9/15/14):  The base game is still superior without it's expansions, but having played it numerous times, it does get a bit stale.  It's still a very good game and I break it out every once in a while, but it doesn't stand the test of time as well as other classic games.

:indigo: :( :what: :D :D :) :) :) This is a good game, and it's a worthy addition to any strategy gamer's arsenal -- it plays quick and it's relatively easy to grasp if you put in the effort (but it's not strictly a gateway game, there's a few too many things to explain to people not used to this sort of thing), it's capable of playing any number of players from 3 to 7, you can play it light if everyone's doing so or you can really dig into the strategy and make it a deeper experience, and the whole thing is done in less than an hour, much less than an hour if everyone's played a few times before. It's unlikely to be my first choice unless time is a serious factor but it's usually fun.

Best with: 3-4. Playable with: 3-7. Probably fine with 2, but why bother?

I like how this game allows for so many players and as they say, the more the merrier! The only downside of this game is if you don't get any trading cards or all the trading cards happen to get picked by people across from you rather than next to you. That disadvantage makes moving forward in the game a bit tough, but altogether it's a fun game and I think the theme is incorporated really well also!

RATING: 10
In my opinion 7 wonders is very close to the perfect type of game I want to play. 

1) It accommodates a broad variety of player groups, from 2-8, so it's almost always an option depending on the party
2) There are a variety of ways to win, and you can't be so self-centered to ignore what your opponents are doing, you often have to react to what they play (and don't play)
3) Everyone takes their turn at the same time.  This mechanic can be rare to find in games but I absolutely love it, because you're almost never waiting very long for other players to finish their turns.  
4) The game has a huge variety in terms of how it can unfold, you'll never play the same game twice. 
5)The learning curve is about mid-range, you can understand all the basic mechanics of the game in a few minutes, but it takes some time to familiarize yourself with all the cards.  You may not truly understand the impact of scoring until you finish your first game and see it for yourself
6) Once everyone knows what they're doing, the game is a short enough length that you'll often want to play multiple times in one sitting.    
7) I like the art style quite a bit!

There are a few shortcomings that I find mostly dismissable, like the fact that being randomly assigned a civilization can force you to adopt one strategy over another, but these are smoothed over by house rules and in later expansions.  I'd recommend 7 wonders to any of my friends, and if you haven't played it at least try it once.

Gets better the more I play it. Great at any #.

update: Part of me is sick of this game but it's enduring popularity in my game group is undeniable. Always easily playable, fun, breezy. The end scoring always brings groans and laughter. It's a game we can always pull out that everyone agrees on. Like many of us, I grew up playing classic card games (for me Crib, Canasta, Hearts etc) and 7W is the one designer boardgame that gives me the same feeling as those card games of my childhood. That pefect blend of strategy, tactics, and luck where if you win, you accomplished something and if you lose the cards were against you:)

Also for some reason I have often thought 'shrug' about 7W when not playing it but when I am playing it I always think 'this game is amazing'..

Cracking game that delivers some very important game design lessons. Turning each player into nodal resources is a wonderful way to supply interaction without supplying interaction (?). It is very easy to get on the table, plays up to 7 (8 with expansion) and does not run into any substantial amount of "dead time" what so ever. For newer players this game is wonderful and one of those games you can always rely on as a fall back. This will stand a very long test of time.

To me, this game is a nice filler with quality pieces and a "think as much as you want" attitude.  Every time I've played this, it was very relaxing to me.  The final goal of victory is fun to try to obtain, but it never really bothers me even if I get crushed because the game just doesn't feel cruel like that.  Though I guess it feels like the final scoring is kind of a bummer after the passing around fun of the initial part of the game.  I'll always play it when it comes out, but never suggest it.

Keep - 2017

Got a few plays under my belt now and I'm getting more comfortable with this game. I get how it plays, but I still seem to be unable to come up with a strategy that works. I think I've come in dead last every game I've played, but I still enjoy the experience and want to play it again.

So I suppose that counts for something.

Update: I've managed a few wins now. I think I found a couple strategies that work, but they feel a bit limited.

Update 2: Had this game quite a while now and have gotten a number of plays under my belt. Each game plays very different depending on the group. I really need to get the darned expansions played sometime.

a very fun & fast game that scales well even with 6 & 7 players.

it can be a touch challenging to teach ( particularly with expansions ) but one of its best aspects is that once everyone knows it, you can knock games out in 15 to 20 minutes.

despite the games being so short, you do feel like you are generally building towards something and over time you learn that to win consistently at the game you cannot play solitaire and need to balance being reactive to some long range planning.

each expansion added more swinginess & a larger luck factor. the game is still fun with expansions but going back and playing just base, I find this is when the game was best balanced.

Very impressive.  I have only played this twice...one 3 player and one 2 player game.  The game is easy to teach (especially if one is familiar with resource management) and easy to learn.  It is full of strategic decisions.  There are so many ways to gain points players always have options, even when a card they were hoping for gets snatched up by another player.  The turn angst about which card to play is fantastic...and it  increases as the game progresses.    Very fun; plays light but has a much deeper core...all in 30 minutes.

And now after several 4 and 5 player games it shines even more.  It's a great little game.

An enjoyable game, It's reasonably complex yet still easy enough to teach new players in a short amount of time. Gameplay is a little dry as you are basically taking a card and passing your hand to the next player. However, there is enough variety in the cards (and wonders), and in what you can do with them, that I don't mind it too much. I love games with good artwork and 7 Wonders has great artwork. Quite honestly this games biggest plus is the short amount of time it takes to play. I tend to like longer, more strategic games, and was pleased to find that 7 Wonders was a short, fast paced game that has a good amount of strategy.

RATING: 8
One of the "have to play" games of modern board gaming and I have yet to meet anyone what didn't enjoy it. For the uninitiated, it's a quick card game that feels very much like Sid Meier's Civilization series. You can win through military, science, culture and the like. Super quick if everyone has already learned how to play. Perhaps a little too much to teach someone totally new to gaming, but anyone with some XP under their belt won't have any trouble picking it up. (A science victory is the only complicated part to learn, since its scoring is exponential.) All in all, a fantastic game that's also great to fill in short gaps of time while you're waiting for a friend to finish another game. Great on its own, though all of the expansions are very worthwhile.

This is a fantastic lightweight (ish) game that easily flexes between 3 - 7 people (haven't played the 2p version, and I doubt I will now that I have 7W: Duel), yet is deep enough to reward tactical responses to the card drafts AND aiming towards an overarching strategy. It might not have enough meat on it to satisfy a brain-melting game-level hunger, but there's a reason why it has the most plays out of my collection.

The more I play it, the more the two player variant grows on me. The free city is more of an afterthought, but getting that extra card cycling from it is surprisingly exciting. With all other player counts it is a decent game as well, which is amplified by its relatively short playtime. There is a lot of strategy in the game, but a lot of the time you just never know how it will turn out because of the other players taking cards. Still a great game that I would not be opposed to playing a lot more

There is more player interaction than I'd have expected. The various scoring methods provide divergent paths to victory. Yet, you really only have 18 decisions in the game, so its never going to take all that long.  

I appreciate a quick yet satisfying game that scales to 7p and is only about 30-45 minutes to play.

This is a great game to serve as an introduction to friends and family who aren't hardcore boardgamers.

RATING: 5
7 Wonders is yet another titles in the card drafting filler to super filler category that has been popular for the past few years. It basically gives players a Fairy Tale type draft where they take turns placing cards to produce resources which can then be used to erect military, science and VP cards. As is usual for these types of games, specialization is usually much better than the smorgasbord, which limits the strategic space of the game, and its ultimate variability. In a decent twist, there is also the ability to use resources from your neighbours for a cost, a bit of interaction that is often absent from these types of games.

As with any drafting game, there are some tough decisions to be made in terms of the pass, but honestly, it's not all that difficult (read: interesting) to play, and there doesn't seem to be a lot of variation in the cards. I don't expect this to have much in the way of legs. Vis a vis its most obvious competitor in Fairy Tale, I think it's a touch worse, as it has a much larger space requirement and set-up/tear-down/play time. Not a bad game, but not a particularly great one either. Unnecessary given the existence of FT, which distills the same basic concept down into a 10 minute, small box title versus a 25-30 minute one in a huge box.

Simple, smooth and enjoyable but I don't see enough variation to make it highly replayable. The fact I managed to beat a veteran player on my first turn speaks volumes about the games learning curve. I can see why it's so popular and I would certainly play it again but I have no desire to own it at this point.

Bought May 2011. Played the pc version and it appears to be a decent game but I'm curious how well it will go f2f and if it has depth or would play well with non gamers. It is a good game but it always seems to fall flat for me for some reason.

Simply amazing. The hand rotation and the people directly next to you really changes your in-game decisions.

On top of that, you need to weigh every pickup for its value. Do you take the 8 point VP card, knowing next guy in line can build the 7 pointer in the same hand you're about to give him? Or do you try to get rid of it and hope that 8 point card makes it back around for you?

I haven't played the 7 player version yet (where you only see every hand once).

Plus, the scaling adds no more time than it takes for the players to make their decisions as the game is always 18 plays.

And so do all the family (aged 10 and 13, although we got it when they were 7 and 10). It was a hit from the very first play, which doesn't always happen. 
Some folks complain about the convoluted scoring system, but that's our favourite part!! Always love a bit of maths while scoring.
Several routes to victory, gorgeous artwork, intuitive mechanics. And the table looks so beautiful at game's end.

RATING: 5
I really feel that the game is stuck between worlds. It is WAY too complex for a quick gateway game but too simple for a light weight strategy game. I'm sure I could become better at the game if I understood all the building chains but the question is WHY. Why would I sink in so much effort to mastering a game that gives me so little control. Sometimes it is easy to pick the best card but other time YOU HAVE NO IDEA. Plus the game is nearly impossible to play well the first time. Sushi Go's simplicity actually makes me feel that my decisions are more meaningful as I can actually weigh the importance of the cards I choose.

That being said, the game isn't bad. I actually enjoy it a lot at 3 players because you can keep track of your opponents which informs your decisions more.

Fun, quick, multiplayer solitaire. I like the card drafting mechanism and you do have some control over the players to your left and right by what cards to send them and build. While you have some control I found I was just caring about my actions and what I can build. This might lessen once you know the cards, but I can see this game wearing out its welcome fairly quickly like Dominion did.

Update 2/2311

Maybe I have just not played it enough to tire me out of it, but I am finding that I am really digging this game. It is still multiplayer solitaire, but it is quite fun. It is not a really deep game, but who cares.

Jogo maravilhoso. Leve, rápido, simples, com o grau ideal de intervenção no jogo dos oponentes, e uma boa gama de decisões para tomar na escolha de cada carta! Sempre no clima para mais uma partida :) 
Cada jogador tem uma Maravilha para aprimorar, e tem 3 eras para fazer isso, o que restringe a duração do jogo. Precisamos de matérias primas e manufaturas para baixar cartas de desenvolvimento em ciências, militarismo, pontos de vitória e comércio, bem como para construir as etapas da Maravilha. Balancear seu jogo é essencial. (Ainda não testei a variante para 2 jogadores).

We've played this so many times! I love that it can support so many players. It's not too difficult to understand and each game offers slightly different challenges. I do find that I tend to recycle the same strategies. Downside: it's too complicated for many of the newer gamers we invite over but no longer my go to when we have more experienced gamers willing to play. As a result, it's been a while since we've played it.

This is a good game requiring a balance of building for the future and taking opportunities to score points. I need to play it more to be able to speak with any credibility on its replayability and variety of strategies. Responding to what other people are building makes this game far more interactive than it seems.

There are different ways to go about balancing your play to get a win. In one game I thought I had done poorly by going for far too many resources and goods at the start but the last round was incredible and I ended up with my highest ever score. 
Scratch that new highest score 84. 4 of each science (16x3+28=76). Blue = 1st round 2point and 3rd round 4 point I think. Military = -6. and mined a guild in the last turn for opponents blue cards (8 points!)

Kicsit bajban vagyok az értékeléssel, mert nagyon ritkán kerül elő a 7 csoda, pedig alapvetően egy nagyon jó játéknak tartom. 

A gyűjteményem első card drafting játéka volt (azóta lett még Sushi Go, ami egy sokkal könnyedebb játék ugyanerre a mechanizmusra, illetve a Kincsvadászt is később vettem meg, ami szintén hasonló módon építi a játékos kezét), és nagyon kedvelem ezt a mechanizmust mivel lehetőséget ad nem csak arra, hogy az ember a saját céljait tolja előre, de ad egyfajta kontrollált, rejtett konfrontációra is lehetőséget a többi játékossal, amikor kifejezetten úgy játszik valaki, hogy ne adjon tovább egy nagyon jó lapot a mellette ülőnek a kezében lévő lapok közül. 

Érdekes módon maga a card drafting a tapasztalatok alapján ebben a játékban kifejezetten nehezen tanítható meg kezdő játékosoknak - az említett két másik játékban ugyanezt sokkal könnyebben abszolválják, szóval nem érdemes olyanokkal leülni 7 csodázni, akik még nem láttak card drafting játékot. Ez valószinűleg azért van, mert sokfélék a kártyák és nehéz az elején mindent átlátni: a mechanizmust, az opciókat, a kártyaszíneket, stb.

Fantasztikus játék. Előnyei:
- 7 játékossal is játszható
- akárhányan játsszuk, 30 perc alatt megvan a játék (szabálymagyarázattal 45 perc)
- akár kezdő játékosoknak is remek, profiknak is megfelelő

Hátrányai: korábban kis szerencséről írtam, ami azért sokkal erősebb, mint eleinte éreztem... no és az is hátrány, hogy "csak" a két szomszéd lapjaira kell igazán figyelni, a többiek kevésbé fontosak.

------
This was one of the more popular prototypes at the Gathering. Or I guess it's more of just a preproduction copy, since I think it's basically done. This is a card game that feels kinda like a board game. With drafting. So sort of like Fairy Tale, but the cool part is how each player is directly related to what each player to their left/right is doing, but only indirectly related to the other players. All game play is in parallel, which means the game scales from 2 (or maybe 3 I don't know) to 7 players, with effectively no added time per player! That is really nice. This got pretty positive feedback from most players, as far as I could tell. I'll definitely be looking for the released version.

RATING: 5
Over time I have developed a healthy sceptical attitude towards eveything that gets hyped in an unnatural fashion; and when 7 Wonders fell victim to this ‘disease’ I decided to let the game be until I was able to give the game a go in a quiet setting. So I didn't try at during Spiel 2010, didn't purchase it there either. Without doubt it would be a reasonably nice game, but no more than that, really.

And 7 Wonders turned out to be that, with one or two things which make it stand out from the crowd. First it is very accessible. The main mechanism of passing cards around means you cannot plan very much, and instead have to make do with scavenging and hoping for the best. Ever since Notre Dame used a similar mechanism I've been of the opinion that this [i]doesn't[/i] promote player interaction: players just react to what they're given, build whatever is best to build (which sometimes is a guess), and from time to time take a look at their opponents when there is a [i]really[/i] good card in there. Second, 7 Wonders plays very well at high player numbers, although to be honest the design cheats to accomplish this: it simply limits interaction between players to the immediate neighbours on the left and right. (In other words, there's seven overlapping 3-player games played at the same time.) Still, in clubs and the like the tendency exists to put Citadels on the table when there's 6 or 7 players and there is demand for something quick: that Citadels is not conceived for so many people is besides the issue. Fortunately, that title can now retire in style as 7 Wonders fills the gap nicely.

Those are truly assets for the niche the game fits in. What remains is a simple collect-resources-and-transform-into-VP game with, entirely expected, multiple ways to victory. The basic structure is very simple (as expected again, because of the ease with which you play as a newcomer); on the other hand, it leaves very much open the question what remains of the game when played more than a few dozen times. 7 Wonders is very tactical in nature, and the decision space limited: those are not assets for an extensive longevity. So while I can understand [i]some[/i] of the attention the game is getting, I certainly don't understand this sort of chivalric romanticism:[q="Greg Schloesser"]7 Wonders is an amazing design. There aren't many games that can pack this much tension, decisions and strategy options in a 30 - 45 minute time frame, while accommodating up to seven players. The game seems to have all the elements to give in great longevity in a hobby where most games fade to obscurity after just a few years. It also has all of the elements that should make it a front-runner to capture industry awards such as the Spiel des Jahre and International Gamers Award. Although this is a year wherein there have been numerous promising games published, 7 Wonders seems destined to rise to the top.[/q]There is, however, a genuine mystery surrounding this game: why on Earth gamers were willing to spend €40 on a box containing 7 small player boards, simple wooden discs, some simple cardboard chits, and about 4 packets' worth of playing cards. My suggestion would be to wait until the game takes on a much fairer price of approximately €25—and for that, the game's rating is lowered by 1 point.

[b]Update[/b] I don't really notice the difference when playing with 3. There is a tad more control over what gets played by whom, but not enough to up or lower the rate I've given the game. It remains friendly material, and it beats Citadels... But I won't purchase it myself.

[b]Update 2[/b] That 'owned' flag is not me. It's my partner, you understand.

Gra, o której słyszał chyba każdy, kto chociaż odrobinę interesuje się grami planszowymi. Klasyk, must have każdego gracza - zresztą nie bez powodu. Mechanika draftu i oddawania kart wymaga czasem zrezygnowania z własnych korzyści, żeby popsuć plany przeciwnikom. Ogromną zaletą jest wykonywanie przez wszystkich ruchu w tym samym momencie, więc partyjka zazwyczaj jest szybka, możliwość zagrania nawet w 7 osób (z dodatkiem Miasta 8) - ogromny plus, bo chyba nie ma drugiej takiej gry, która spełnia kryteria tematyki i czasu rozgrywki, jednocześnie przy tak dużej liczbie graczy. Rozgrywka za każdym razem inna, wymagająca do samego końca. Dzięki zróżnicowanej punktacji prowadzonej dopiero na zakończenie, gra aktywnie się do końca.

Meh. If I'm going to play something civ-ish, I want some meat to it. This is way too abstract and way too nice to hold my interest for long. Was fun for the first couple of plays.

RATING: 7
A good game that I'm not in love with as much as most, but with a group of 4-7 people it does well. In each of three rounds you are drafting cards from your hand. But each turn you only take one card and then pass the rest on. While some will come back to you (depending on the number of players) most will not, so you have to be judicious with what you take, or sometimes deny other players. You can score in a variety of ways, such as military, science, economy, etc. I still rate it a 7 currently, but probably only because I don't play it too often.

This game was much hyped, but after two initial, 4-player games, did not hold my interest. 

Recently, however, my wife and I have enjoyed several 2-player games, and are looking forward to more plays.  Still need a few more plays for a proper evaluation.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Excellent game for light game players when the crowd demands that everyone needs to play in a single game.  Will usually pull this out if we have a large group and I'm the only one capable of running/teaching games.

Once you get the symbology down, it is a fairly easy game.  I do agree that the game is pretty shallow, but this can be resolved by adding in the expansion(s).

Lots of avenues for success. High replayability, even back-to-back. Well designed game pieces and cards that display information in an easy to read manner.

However, many unique card abilities make referencing the cheat sheet a must and there's quite a bit of math at the end to tally Victory Points, which is a bit anticlimactic.

I seem to be getting worse instead of better at this game, but that isn't impacting my enjoyment much.  Like Dominion, you can have a lot of fun playing even if you aren't winning, and the short playtime and wide range of supported player numbers make it often a good choice.

RATING: 7
This game is perfect for me because it only supports three players and I only have two friends.  If I only had one friend, I'd have to play with a "dummy" player where I'd pretend I had an extra friend at the table and that is even sadder than only having two friends.  If I somehow made a third friend with a name like, let's say, "Henrietta" who, I dunno, worked downstairs in Processing and I dunno, had a cactus on her desk that she put little hats on for different holidays, well, I'd never get to play with her since she'd be across the table from me, since if I sat next to her, it would be weird, right?  So I'd pass cards to Jeff and Jeremy, and never to her, which means I'd never get to "accidentally" slip and brush against her hands and we would never get married and have four dogs named after my favorite breakfast cereals, Chocula, Cap'n Crunch, Twix Rabbit, and Special K with Strawberries.

So it's a fun three player game, but I will never find love.

7 Wonders reminds me of a fun type of poker game I played back in the 1980s called "pass the trash".  7 Wonders is simple, cute and fun to play.  I prefer this game with 4 or more players.  The expansions 7 Leaders and 7 Cities are really what made the game for me and raised it from a mediocre game to something most of my gaming friends can sink their teeth into and enjoy.  The theme of trade and conflict in the ancient world of the Mediterrainean has a nice touch to it.  The game pieces and cards are colorful and nice.  Originally, I used this game as a filler game when first purchased, but I was surprised by how much the game was nominated for play thereafter.  If you are looking for a game that plays in under an hour, I highly recommend 7 Wonders with the expansions.

RATING: 9
A brilliant little game.  Players are faced with a myriad of choices that slowly start to disappear as each round progresses - and the decisions made early on can have major effects later in the game.

What is satisfying is that there is no one clear path to victory.  A balance of buildings might work, or perhaps a strong military, or even the right combination of scientific knowledge.  Each game is different than the last, and every player decision affects everyone else.  A delight!

The cards and boards are beautiful to look at.  If I had one complaint it would be the cheap box insert, flimsy directions and unnecessarily large box.

I like this game because it has relatively simple mechanics that someone new can pick up in a few minutes of explanation, but is actually a fairly complex game. Unlike many other games of this description, I often see new players do quite well - or at least not get trounced - in comparison to more experienced players. Therefore, we often finish a game and have new players want to start a second game right away!

This game is fun,.... but it just feels like your playing by yourself most of the time. Everyone is on their own board, doing their own thing, sometimes influencing players next to them, but never farther than that.

This may be the first game I trade out of my collection in the future.

Great game for big groups as well as small groups (it plays 3-7 players). While it plays well for big groups, there is a lack of interaction with players who aren't sitting next to you.

I love the way this game is played, I love the artwork, I love the different Wonders and their different play styles. 7 Wonders is just about everything I want in a game--it is competitive, it is beautiful, I have never played anything like it (but I'm still rather new to this gaming scene) and there are a million different viable paths to victory.

Is it a board game or a card game though? I'll never know.

What else you gonna play when you got a group of 7.  Honestly, it is fun because you are always playing.  It takes up too much space and the cards often get displaced on the table.  It can be hard to know if you are doing well relative to others, while playing the game.

RATING: 7.5
Hesitant at first to pick up a drafting board/card game, still I had played Magic the Gathering in the past.  I had also drafted it quite a bit and did enjoy that particular aspect of the game.  I didn't know how it would convey into a board game design as the main feature of play involved.  Picked it up after reading and viewing some reviews, and started off a Friday Night as the main attraction.  It sure did hit the main attraction, after the first initial play with five people in total, it broke the ice with us. We talked, laid a card, talked (looking at what people had done), picked another, and so on and so forth.  

Not every game brings out so much discussion and badgering like this game does for my group.  Hearing, 'look at how much science he has,' or, 'holy ****, that is a lot of Military next to me,' it gets the blood pumping for me.  We had six plays of the game that weekend.  I suggested I sleeve the cards to everyone, and the response from everyone was the same, 'yes do that.'  With just that phrase, I can tell I'm going to get a long mileage out of this game; so I better make sure they stay nice as long as possible.

One of the games that brought me into gaming.
Like the drafting and the art.
Though once being one of my favorite games, after playing it a quiet some times, it looses some of the flair it first had. The set-collecting feels flat after a while.

Note sure that one of the expansions currently out there could solve that problem for me.
But still a perfect game to get someone into playing board games.

RATING: 8
Clever mechanism to keep playing time low with many players (all players take their turns simultaneously) - an extremely big plus in larger groups! This definitely makes 7 Wonders my most preferred strategy(ish) game for 6 or 7 players (or for 8 with [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/111661/7-wonders-cities]Cities[/url]), because many of the alternatives tend to have problems with too much downtime between turns. But I also like it a lot with fewer players, it is even good with 2.

It has a high level of luck compared to most other games I love and is probably more tactical than strategical. But there are still several ways how strategic planning can pay off and deep considerations can be made and give definite advantages.
The still rather high level of luck means the game is well suited to play with and appeal to beginners who have a chance to win even in their first game - but in contrast to many other games for which this is true, it's still also thrilling for the more experienced players, at least for me.

I hate hidden trackable information (HTI) in games (see my profile) and thus don't like the rather strong incentive for the memorization of hands in 7 Wonders - I don't want to play "[url=www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/7688/memory]Memory[/url]". But I'm willing to tolerate it in this otherwise excellent game! Besides, the bigger the group (in which 7 Wonders particularly excels compared to other games), the fewer hands will come back to you and the fewer returns you get from memorizing cards.

Another minus is that the two sides of several of the wonders could clearly and thus should have been balanced better. This is most obvious on Ephesus, where the B side is clearly and reasonably undisputably stronger than the A side. On Rhodes and Alexandria, the B side is too close to clearly dominate the A side as well in my opinion - but at least it isn't as clear as with Ephesus.
I am not quite sure how this could have happened particularly in case of Ephesus as it is really obvious if you add up - wasn't it a design goal to make the two sides of each wonder as equally strong as possible?
This is particularly annoying for me because I prefer to draw only the wonder randomly and let the players choose the side. The game would be better if it were a real choice more often.

This is a great light game about drafting, with civilization theme. But unlike fairy tale (which only set collection game), there's a great amount of mechanics in this game. Also, each player will have their own wonder (with different ability) making the game really flavorful. 

The game itself is very tactical, with some degree of strategy. There's no winning strategy. You must be able to look at your opponents, and draft accordingly, whether try the strategy that they're not doing, or counter draft. Also, the game is quite easy to teach (if you're experienced teacher), and lots of fun, making it great game for gateway.

After few play this game seems to be very good in any number of suggested players. And there aren't many games for 7 player of such quality. And the short gameplay time is a big advantage, too.

After number of game sessions where this game has been an enormous success I must raise the rating to 10. This game is truly addictive, replayable and so much fun.

After 2 years spent with 7 Wonders I must say, that there is no other game, that hits the table that often. After so many games, there is not the "wow" factor or the feeling of freshness anymore, but still the game is very addictive even after such a long time (and the Cities expansion made a huge step forward to replayability, because it adds some variety and randomness (in the good meaning) to the base game.

RATING: 9
Components: Nice, over-sized cards, though they really start to fill up the table after a bit. Wonderful art. The iconography is clear but too small in the 'costs' corner of the cards, making it difficult to audit my neighbors as the cards are played.

Experience: I went into my first game thinking I would invest heavily in raw and manufactured goods, so that I wouldn't need to rely on commerce with my neighbors. This ended up pushing me toward a brown/gray/blue strategy, since I found myself continually strapped for cash. Other players focused more on commerce, or on science. I hammered my neighbors with military, but they were able to compensate in other ways. Very interesting.

Seems to be well balanced, and I expect that as we become more familiar with the cards, the game will become more competitive. With complete knowledge of all cards in circulation (except for the guilds in Age III), and with better knowledge of the build chains, one could employ different strategies with better clarity than I was in this first outing.

I appreciate that my neighbors can't muck with me too much (other than taking my cards, and vying for military might). Nearly every card is attractive to build. Whereas in Agricola the game mandates that I have a little of everything, this game, like Stone Age, seems to push me more toward extremes: specialize in a few different scoring methods, and let the rest fall to the side, otherwise I end up being mediocre in everything.

I'm beginning to feel like Science is too good, as more often than not the player who scores the most in science is also the winner. I also want a bit more direction in terms of final scoring (somewhat provided by the Leaders), to prevent me from just making the same choices every time.

Like in Kingsburg, there isn't much in this game to make me try new strategies; our group is in a bit of a rut with the types of cards we play.

I used to think this was the perfect game, and I still think it's excellent. The theme could be integrated with the gameplay a little better though. It just feels like you're playing cards and not actually building a civilization. That said, for what it is, it's superb and a must-have in any collection because it plays so smoothly and quickly even at higher player counts. It's simple enough to be a "gateway plus" game, but meaty enough for experienced gamers. The game design supports multiple winning strategies and rewards smart play.

RATING: 10
I really enjoy this game. It comes over first time as a little complex, due to the number of symbols on the cards, but one play through is all it takes to grasp the game.

I like the quick drafting style of card selection that brings in resource collection and construction in a nice easy manner.

I prefer the game on it's own, without expansions, which is why I've never picked any of them up.

I rate this a 10 as I've never not enjoyed it, whether it's been 3, 4, 5, or 6 players. I can't see there being a time I would turn down playing this.

I'm not a fan of drafting games so a predisposed not to like this. Although my main grip with this game is that the starting wonders feel unbalanced and it makes a huge  difference what wonders the people on either side of you end up with. This is made even worse with the expansions. Don't sit next to Mannequin Pis with Rome opposite you in a six player game.

Agree with other criticisms. Same bad passing mechanism as in the Fairytale game.
It destroys strategy, makes for bad AP (look at players to side, try to figure how to not give 3 players 3 cards they or their neighbor(s) can use) ,and is confusing. Your military can only affect neighbors- too bad the nation away from you is building a bigger VP army! And your goals change thoughout play. I dub thee: 7 Blunders.

Easy to learn, fast, and contains almost no downtime due to the simultaneous drafting mechanic. Despite its apparent simplicity, it offers a fairly fulfilling strategic experience which only gets richer with each expansion you add. There is not really much player interaction, even with the expansions included, but the drafting does allow you to hinder your opponents' progress indirectly by playing or discarding a card you think they may desire. 

One of the most impressive aspects of 7 Wonders is how well it scales. It is very fun, challenging, and engaging with 3 as well as 7 players and plays just as smoothly and quickly with any player count.

Played this a lot immediately after we got it, and enjoyed it a lot too.  Really like the elegance of the core mechanic - play one pass the rest on.  Artwork is nice.  Cards really need to be sleeved as they show wear quickly (and they get a lot of use).  To keep it interesting you need to play with different numbers - the game changes completely from 3 to 5 to 7.
After having for longer the difficulty of predicting scoring and seeming arbitrariness of strategy can be frustrating.

[b]What I dislike:[/b] as discussed, I don't like the Cities or Babel expansions - they don't add enough fun compared to the complexity added.

[b]Colour Blindness:[/b] The Black Cities cards are not always clear, but that is more due to the lack of familiarity to the iconography

With as many plays with 3+ as with only 2, I prefer it at lower counts.  At high player counts, it's light and fast, but that's about it.  There's not a lot to decide.  And then it ceases to be anything resembling fun if one of the 6 or 7 players goes overboard with AP.  If I want a serious game of 7 Wonders, I'll play it 2-player.  But I don't much do that even.

A note about my rating:  It was about 3 years between my first plays of this and acquiring it and finally playing it again.  All during that time, it sat near the top of my wishlist.  Its praises kept ringing in my ears, and my anticipation and expectations kept rising.  This worked to the detriment of my enjoyment of 7 Wonders nowadays.  I want to rate it higher, but it's not something I want to play very often.  Though I don't know that I'd turn down a game.  I think it's a solid game, but I'll usually go for other tableau builders like Uchronia or San Juan over this one.  They lack the drafting, but are more satisfying.

Fast playing and interesting civ-building game with the twist of using a rotating hand draft mechanism. Cards are a bit too big for what they are (same info could easily have been put on standard cards), resulting in overuse of table space and hard to sleeve. Knowing what's in each of the decks is fairly important, and I could see a six/seven player game where you get *one* draw from each "hand" as much more tactical than the three player game where you get to pick two and can hope that cards come back around to you. 

Provisional 8 for now because it's quick to set up and play. The fact that we played two games in a row was a good sign, I felt. Science cards (greens) may be too powerful unless other players prevent them from being chosen through wonders or discards, and even the second is no good against a player with a wonder that lets them take discarded cards.  Three may be the sweet spot for this particular game, but only time will tell.

Everything this game does it does fine. But it doesn't feel like it does anything especially well. Once you're a few turns in, the cards you choose are fairly obvious and hate-drafting is rarely worth it. There's a little engine-building but not so much that it feels really rewarding when that engine works just right. There's some set collection but I'm not convinced that set collection is capable of making any game good on its own merits. And, finally, the paths to victory are pretty heavily unbalanced and subject either to luck of the draw or how much the people playing are willing to set themselves back (usually to their peril) in order to prevent the leader from winning. I mean, I'll play it without complaint, but nothing here excites me.

It's competitive without being aggressive, the mechanics are (providing you stick to A side) easy to pick up, and even a new player can overcome an experienced one with the right hand and quick thinking.

While I wouldn't say I play it regularly anymore, I rarely say no to 7 Wonders when it gets pulled out at a party.

RATING: 8
7 Wonders is an enjoyable medium euro game. It is easy enough to understand and play, offers tough choices, encourages interaction and scales from three to seven players. In addition it plays simultaneously and at a fast enough pace. Regardless, 7 Wonders is not a thematically strong game and most plays of it are not very memorable. A mechanically solid, if slightly unimpressive, game.

Deserving of its praise. Especially from phase II onwards, the choices you have to make are interesting and strategic. Nice balance between solitaire building aspects and  interacting/messing with your neighbors. Scales beautifully from 2 (we like the 'free city' variant) to at least 6. Great artwork, great pace. Explaining to new players can be a pain, although its easy after you played it once. Does not hit the table as often after a while.

2-7 players, 30-45 minutes, light medium, card drafting/deck building

https://boardgamegeek.com/article/21720247#21720247

This is easily one of my favourite games.

I've played a dozen games with 3-7 players and it is great fun everytime and with every player count. It seems rather complex at first, but it plays rather naturally after a few rounds.

In its core this is a card drafting / tableau building  game over three phases, where you want to build up your resources at first to be able to build your own economy, military and science and if possible, you personal wonder. To do this, you choose one card to play and pass the other cards to your neighbour. When all the cards are played, then intermediate scoring takes place (on military power) and the next phase starts. After phase 3 the game ends and final scoring takes place.

There are several paths that can lead to victory, but it's usually best to focus on one or two routes. Keeping a close eye on your neighbour is very important as you can benefit from his resources, goods and -especially in the last phase- from the cards he/she has played.

All in all, I really like this game. It plays rather fast, so you can play a number of games on a single night. I rate this game 9/10 and would play this again anytime :)

Really impressed at how well this works with any range of players.  It's fast, easy to teach and fun.  I have a feeling this will become a go-to game for us.  My only concern is that it may lose some luster after repeated plays since there aren't that many paths to victory, but the card draft does make every hand interesting.

Fairly steep learning curve for newbies. It usually takes a full half-hour (after going over the rules and playing the first few rounds) before people catch on.  By Age III, most people understand the game well enough that they regret a few decisions in Ages I and II, so that tells me they're getting it.

A fun game that somehow manages to capture the feel of building a civilization in a short period of time. As cards are passed you need to quickly decide how best to utilize what you have been given, even if it means abandoning your original strategy. There is a small amount of interaction, mainly in deciding whether to keep something to benefit yourself or to go with the lesser card in order to deny it to an opponent who needs it more. You also need to plan with an eye on what resources you can buy from your neighbors, and to be prepared to deal militarily with them as well. The game scales pretty well, with a different challenge depending on how many are playing. 

While the expansions add variety, the smoothness of the base game gets messed with just enough that I feel the original is the way to go. I keep the expansions to add as a change of pace.

Cards are sleeved. Base game box includes Leaders and Cities expansions, Wonders expansion and several promo cards. I also have the Broken Token insert.

this one just didn't do it for me.
It felt like you had to invest more than what the game could possibly ever give back to you. If you want to play it well you might not have to MEMORISE ALL cards in the game but you should have a rough feel for what kind of options there are. In that respect it felt almost like a trading card game or LCG to me (learn all the cards and find the best combinations). 
It felt a bit pointless playing it with compeltely new players. The basic "draft" gameplay is very simple to teach, but players are then usualyl at a complete loss of what there actually supposed to do with the cards or which ones to collect. You do learn pretty quickly how some of the cards work but it didn't feel worthwhile to me... and then the game ends in a huge point salad of counting and adding up points on a little note pad....  arrghhh!!!!

While i didn't want to give it too low a rating after having only played it a couple of times i now feel that i have very little interets in revisiting it.

Quick and light, but player interaction is next to nil.  At the end of the game I have to look up to see who I'm playing with. This has a lot to do with  the card drafting mechanic. I generally don't complain about solitaire in games but I wish this was more interactive.

Antoine Bauza really hit the jackpot with this "broadband" game (and the sales numbers validate this sentence)!

7 Wonders apealls equally for the family, for parties, for gamers - it's the game that offers the most quality on account of it´s versatility!
Altough fairly simple, it´s mechanic is not perceived at once by non gamers, however, by the end of the first game, they usually get it without problems.
This is the only game capable of providing a taste in creating a civilization with such an easy set of rules, based on a card drafting and a set collection, that plays itself in no more than an hour and doesn´t get any heavier or longer by having a higher number of players - this is truly remarkable and (i think) a unique feature among the world of boardgames. Very well done!

7 Wonders in as interesting game as it scales from 2 to 7 players, and it popularised the drafting mechanism. Some people hate the 2 player variant - however, I (and prominent reviewer Rahdo) rave about it.

Next to Settlers of Catan, this is one of the first modern "board" game that I've played.

Great family and large group game. A classic.

Pros: Simultaneous play, low downtime. Great introduction to player interaction through simple card drafting mechanism. Civilization building theme with simple tech trees. Relatively quick gameplay and setup. Good cardboard components and art. Iconography is easy to understand at a glance. Comprehensive rulebook.

Neutral: Not infinitely replayable but there is a lot of game in the box and there are several expansions which add new cards, mechanisms, and length. Due to the different types of cards and icons in play, the first game is a throwaway learning game unless you understand card drafting and civilization building.

Cons: Weak cardstock but just playable without sleeves.

The rules are intimidating as all get-out; just start playing and work it out as you go.  By your second run-through it'll take you an hour for a game - by your third it'll be more like 45 minutes and you'll have "got it".

This is one of those games where there are half a dozen different ways to score.  Trying to pay attention to all of them will just bury you in detail; just pick one or two to concentrate on to begin with, til you get a feel for what works and what doesn't.

Very entertaining.  Watch who you sit next to!

For a first-time play, it was pretty fun. Only one person in the group had played before, but was rusty on the rules. So it was definitely a learning experience. However, once we got the hang of how things worked (prob. messed up the rules a lot) it was a pretty fun game. Waiting to cast judgement on it until I play a few more times.

Fun drafting game, but it's missing interactivity.  

I think the game is best with three people, as you can control what cards people get more easily and you have the opportunity to see the cards you pass again, which allows for planning.

Regardless of its flaws I still have fun building my thing when I play it.  It's basically just one quarter of Through the Ages though, which I'd rather play.

I'm looking forward to playing again with experienced players to get a feel for the meat of the game which I think has the potential to be really good.

I really enjoy the surprising complexity of this fast-paced tableau-building card game.  Several times I've figured out strategies that lead to regular wins, only to have those strategies fade and fail when my opponents' adjust their own play.  Plus there's nothing else that can support seven players with such little downtime and overall game time.

Almost all of my plays are for 5-7 players, the range I prefer.  Under 5 the game changes and military becomes much more dominant, and with 8 players the randomness of cards received is too great for much any strategy at all.

The civilization theme helps a lot.
This is basically a dumbed down version of Fairy Tale: draft and instantly play the card you get, instead of choosing the order in which you can play it.
To catch up with the less depth, the game get more complex, with several scoring systems.

Additionally, to have a broader success, it suffices to blow on the hype, have a big box and an insane price tag... this is what you need to reach the top 15 on BGG.

Fantastic card drafting game that works very well with all player levels. More than 5 players can get a bit analysis paralysis, but it is a great game to play when you have a big group that you don't want to split across multiple games.

Easy to teach and plays up to seven players makes this a winner for me.  There is a slight learning curve to the strategy, so an experienced player should easily win over the newcomers, but with a short playtime you can usually get a few games in one sitting.  Production value is great.

Well-designed civilization-building card game.
Nearly impossible to create a 100% balanced civilization, so there's quite an interesting strategic dynamic involved in selecting your pathway to victory: will you build up your military at the expense of science? Will you be ruler of the marketplace at the expense of your strength in battle? I definitely recommend this with 4+ players if you can, because this just adds to the depth of strategy. However, most of my games have been with just 2 players, and it still has engaging gameplay.
Certainly one of my Top 20 favorite games.

2-7

Voorbereiding:

Elke speler krijgt een wonderbord en 3 munten.
Verwijder uit de 3 kaartstapels de ongebruikte kaarten (afhankelijk van het aantal spelers).
Selecteer willekeurig paarse kaarten voor de tijdperk 3 stapel en schud deze door de stapel.

Speloverzicht:

Er zijn drie tijdperken: tijdperk 1, 2 en 3. Punten worden uitgereikt aan het einde van tijdperk 3. Aan het begin van elk tijdperk krijgt elke speler een hand van 7 kaarten.

1. Kies een kaart: 

Elke speler kiest en speelt een kaart gesloten, daarna draaien alle spelers simultaan de kaart open.

2. Mogelijke acties: 

a/ bouw de kaart open (je kunt hetzelfde gebouw niet twee keer bouwen)
b/ bouw de kaart gesloten als een Wonder (van links naar rechts)
c/ leg de kaart op de aflegstapel en neem 3 geld van de bank

3. De volgende hand: 

Elke speler geeft zijn handkaarten door aan de naburige speler. 

Tijdperk 1 en 3: in wijzerzin.
Tijdperk 2: tegenwijzerzin.
De laatste kaart van elk tijdperk die alle spelers overhouden, gaat naar de aflegstapel.

Gebouwen:

Geldkosten: de kosten worden aan de bank betaald. 
Gratis bouwen: het gebouw kan gratis worden gebouwd. 
Grondstofkosten: de aangegeven grondstoffen worden geproduceerd door de stad van de speler en/of gekocht volgens de handelsregels. 
Gratis bouwen (keten): Als een speler reeds een kaart met hetzelfde symbool heeft liggen, mag hij alle kaarten met dat symbool gratis bouwen.

Wonder:

Grondstofkosten: de aangegeven grondstoffen worden geproduceerd door de stad van de speler en/of gekocht volgens de handelsregels.
 
Productie:
De grondstoffen van een stad worden geproduceerd door het wonderbord, de bruine kaarten, de grijze kaarten en sommige gele kaarten. 

Om een gebouw of fase van een Wonder te bouwen zonder handel, moet de stad van de speler de grondstoffen produceren zoals aangegeven op de kaart van het gebouw of op het bord van het Wonder. 

Grondstoffen worden niet verbruikt tijdens het bouwen. Ze kunnen elke ronde tijdens het hele spel gebruikt worden. De productie van een stad kan nooit verminderen. 
Handel:

Elke speler kan alleen handelen met de twee naburige steden. 
Elke gekochte grondstof kost 2 geld, te betalen aan de eigenaar (spelers kunnen nooit weigeren om grondstoffen te verkopen). 
Een verkochte grondstof hindert de eigenaar niet om zelf deze grondstof in dezelfde ronde te gebruiken voor zijn eigen bouwen. 

Na elk tijdperk volgt er een militair conflict.
Elke speler vergelijkt het totaal aan schildsymbolen op zijn militaire gebouwen (rode kaarten) met het totaal van elk van de naburige steden:

a/ Speler heeft meer schilden dan zijn buurman: +1 fiche (in tijdperk 1), +3 fiche (in tijdperk 2) en +5 fiche (in tijdperk 3). 
b/ Speler heeft minder schilden dan zijn buurman: -1 fiche 
c/ Speler heeft evenveel schilden als zijn buurman: geen fiche.

Elke speler krijgt dus, afhankelijk van de situatie, 0, 1 of 2 fiches op zijn speelbord.

Na Tijdperk 3 tellen de spelers hun punten:
1/ punten op militaire fiches
2/ 1 punt voor elke 3 geld
3/ punten op het wonder
4/ punten op gele gebouwen
5/ punten op blauwe gebouwen
6/ punten op paarse gebouwen
7/ punten voor groene gebouwen

There are not many games that play great and quick with 7 players, but this one does. You only need a big table!

[i]Notre Dame[/i] without the rats, and a light [i]Through the Ages[/i] veneer to boot.

It's fast, it's fun, it accomplishes what it set out to accomplish. One or two plays will be required for newbs to understand all the possibilities, but considering the short playing time this shouldn't be a major issue.

But, ultimately, just too light for my tastes. Just filler, really.

What I liked:
* Nice Length to Complexity

* Scales well with 3-7 players
* Easy to teach/learn

What I didn't like:
* If another player isn't being kept under control on the other side of the table, there is nothing you can do.

Close to a perfect game for me.

RATING: 8
One of the few satisfying games that can handle large numbers without taking forever to play. True, this is achieved by essentially being multiplayer solitaire with some minor interaction with your immediate neighbours. Interaction is obviously via war points, but also via denying cards to your downstream neighbour and avoiding what your upstream is collecting. The drafting mechanism is handled well and the different ways to score provide a nice illusion of strategy and control. The cash and resource management doesn't get in the way of speedy play. A good game to start a game session or to wind down after something meatier.

RATING: 7
7 Wonders is a nice game that i randomly enjoy playing although it doesn't hit the mark as I like but not love the game.
The very first few plays with new players always go with the sentence "I don't even know why i need to collect these". After few plays players start to get the logic and the game goes though very well.
The game works well almost only with people who has few plays behind their back.
A way more casual alternative, if you don't have a fix player group, would be Sushi Go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game plays very differently with six or seven players than with three. In the former version, you pretty much do the best you can with the hand that's passed to you; you don't know which cards you'll get or when you'll get them. The three-player game, on the other hand, permits some planning, as you see each hand twice and can predict somewhat the cards that your opponents will be interested in. I enjoy both versions.
The variety of ways to score is impressive for such a quick game, although with 6 or 7 players, collecting the blue cards seems to be a tough strategy to defeat, and the science cards seem to be a losing proposition unless the other players are asleep at the switch.

I have finally played the elusive 7 Wonders.

It wasn't a bad experience and I'm sure with multiple plays I would see the strategy come out a little more.

It seems to play almost like a deconstructed RftG, which is fine.

I'm going to have to try to get another game to see if the rating will go up or down.

I did tie for 2nd place with 56 points during my first game (7 players) against people who have played numerous times. I think the person (who was to my left) might have won because I and the other tied 2nd place player (to the winner's right) gave him the victory based on cards he drew.

Received (along with [gameid=83445])in trade for [gameid=15363].

Includes Expansions: Leaders

Meh.  This is a nice game because it is accessible for all players.  The Leaders expansion does add a little strategic depth to it, but not enough in my opinion.  I also have issues with the fiddlyness of playing and passing.  It is frustrating when everyone plays, and then someone says...crap, I cheated because i doubled buildings or underpaying etc...

I understand that there are several more expansions coming.  I have heard 7 expansions is the target..just money grubbing IMO.

I prefer this to Race for the Galaxy, not least because I think that the military side of things is handled much better here ;-)  Fair amount of replayability, and I like the way that the Age decks vary with number of players.  The 2-player variant is actually quite a challenge.

A bit disappointed in this game given its high ranking on several lists. Doesn't seem like there's much strategy or point in trying to focus on a particular path. Just take the best card available this time, go to the next hand, and repeat until all three ages are over.

Its fun, just not necessarily a great game.

I really enjoy 7 Wonders. The theme is great—who doesn't want to build up their own city, and raise their epic wonder to legendary heights? I also like that it is non-adversarial, which makes it an easy sell for family game night. I've heard it said it can grow stale over time, but through several plays already it shows no signs of losing its luster.

Pros: great design / well balanced game / obviously well thought out / great components.

Cons: just doesn't excite me very much.  

Analysis: the initial experience of playing the game numerous times was a good one.  The game was fun enough, especially the card drafting mechanic.  But I didn't get a sense of the overall theme of "building" something.  The card names were superfluous and the powers/abilities of the cards linked with the card names didn't matter (like Dominion in that sense - like a pasted on theme).  There are multiple paths to victory (more military or more science etc.) but I never got a good feel for what might work better than others. Almost like the game is TOO well balanced in that regard.  Which makes it seem almost like it is random in terms of which path to take.  

After all of that, it was still enjoyable enough and I would probably play it if asked.  But it just fell flat despite the great production and obviously good game design.

[2011-03-24 Rating: n.a. -> 6.5]

After playing 7 Wonders numerous times on Brettspielwelt and also face to face, I finally settled down to give this one a 6.5. After reading the first positive reviews, I was eager to give this one a try. The first two games went really well and I had a lot of fun. But the more I played it, the less I liked it. I mean, it's fun to build your own little civilization, but it feels more like a pastime than a game.

Because there are about a hundred ways to score points, you just have to take a route that no one else follows and hope that you'll get the cards you need or at least some cards that give you more points than your opponent. There is no real long-term strategy or hard decision making. I guess, this game is just a little too light for my taste.

Not sure I understand all the love this game gets.  Simple fairly obvious decisions.  Best with 3, as you scale up decisions become less meaningful.  Fast and frequently requested so it will stay in my collection, but I don't see it as a permanent addition.

It's an interesting game, but every game of it feels the same to me. I don't feel like there's much worth strategizing over, since you're at the mercy of whatever hand you're passed. I'll play it with people, but I'm never the one to suggest it. I think there are better games out there for large-ish groups. I will say that I do like the fact that it's quick, and you are never waiting on someone to finish a turn before you can do something, so that gives it a bit of a bump.

This is a very fun and quick game to play that scales to ANY number (well starting at 3 players).  Why does it scale up so well?  Because everyone plays their turns at the same time!

The core mechanic is a Magic: the Gathering style booster draft.  Everyone looks at a hand of cards, chooses one card, and hands the rest of the cards to the player next to them.  Once everyone has chosen a card, everyone plays that card at starts the process over by looking at the cards that were passed to them. 

Each card has a cost to play (just like in Magic) and a benefit.  The benefits of the cards follow a civilization style chart where you can get prerequisites which allow other cards to be played for free.

There are several types of cards: Resources, Marketplace, Military, Science, Civic, and 1 other (they were purple, but I can;t remember what they were called).  Resources and Marketplace enable you to play cards, and the others give you victory points.  

After 3 rounds of booster drafting (just like in Magic, where you pass left, then right, and then left again), the player with the most victory points wins.

7 Wonders plays very quickly, is not too taxing, and is very enjoyable.  My only fear is that it might not have too much replayability, so my rating will go up if I start to see that there is a lot of hidden skill.  In all, this game is highly recommended by me.

Is this a game or a shared experience? Where are the meaningful choices? This is an entry level game with too many rules and symbols to attract new gamers. This is a "line in the sand" game for me. If someone rates this higher than a 7, I'm playing games for much different reasons than that person. Absolutely, unequivocally over-hyped game that has zero interesting or difficult choices; it gives people the illusion of strategy and so many people buy into it.

Despite the fact that the "User Suggested # of Players" indicates that this is "Not Recommended" for two players, I honestly believe it's best with two. (I'd have to give the two-player version an "8".) This is due to the control you have and to the fact that every other turn you get to make decisions for two players (you and the dummy player). As soon as you add a third player, your decision-making is cut by one-third, though it's still a decent game (probably a "7"). But as you add more players, you lose more control, and I have no interest in playing this with more than three. Despite my complaints about the scaling, this is a well-crafted game with some very clever mechanisms. But if I'm going to play a multi-player filler, I'd rather play something with no set-up time.

One of the best games i've ever played, that both gamers and non gamers like! Smooth mechanics, tough decisions between great and excellent choices in every turn! By the end of the game, just before scoring, everybody feels confident and happy with what they have created!  That itself is the best compliment to the game! 
It s a game where there are many roads to victory! So you have to pick one, but ignore none. Otherwise you stand no chances at the final scoring. A must have!

My gateway game into the board gaming world. Easy to play and many strategies in winning the game. This game is also scalable to as many as 7 players which is an added bonus. I liked the card drafting game play which was one of the first few gaming mechanics that I was exposed to. Gaming time is decently short which allows many rounds of re playability.

I was on the fence with this game for so long and decided to borrow a friend's copy.  I wanted to make sure it would work with my family of players 6,9,11,14,16 and mom and dad.  It was an instant hit with all of us!  My 6 year old loves it and begs to play it.  

Ordered our own copy right away with expansion boards and we play it everyday.  My 6 year old even won a game!  As a homeschool mom I love games we can all play together so this is top on my list!

One of the best games this year. The only reason it doesn't get a higher rating right away is that I'm a bit concerned about the replay value of it. Will it still be fun after 10+ games? I guess so really.

Other than that it's an awesome game. Scales well with any number of players, plays immensely fast and still manages to give you a feeling of having accomplished something. Really like the way you interact with your neighbours as well.

Am I the only one reminded of Fairy Tale? Does much of the card drafting in the same way as 7 Wonders.

RATING: 8
It's a really fun game, though it really does play best when you have more people.  While it's easy to learn the rules, non-gamers seem to have issues with the card UI and understanding what they need to do, etc.  Main complaint would be that it's best played with a group of people that are quite comfortable with the game, as newer players can get stomped pretty easily.

RATING: 7
7 Wonders is about drafting.  That may sound silly, but it's important because many people come to this game looking for a different kind of strategy.  For those who enjoy drafting for its own sake, 7 Wonders delivers.  You need to be attentive to your neighbors so that you aren't fighting them the same points and dragging yourself down versus the table.

Because of this, playing with players that don't think about the drafting and doggedly pursue set collection based on whim can produce unsatisfying games.  With players that really like to draft, the game gets better and better.  Not an amazing game, but one that is very solid as a short, fun experience.

Plays well at all player counts and those who claim it's less deep with more players are simply less familiar with larger draft table dynamics.  In fact, I think three player is the least skill intensive player count.  Judicious selection of expansions can make the game even more interesting.

I heard so much about how it was an awesome booster draft.  It's not a booster draft if you play each card as you get it.  It's almost Rat-A-Tat Cat.  Totally pointless game with maybe one choice that requires thought each time.

RATING: 6
Can't decide whether this is a 7 or 6.  I like the drafting element.  I like the chaotic planning this game delivers.  But how much planning is there really and how much is this just a random draft.  I can appreciate that it plays with 7, but with that many it really becomes a crapshoot because you can't plan a strategy based on what you've seen.  The cards won't make it around again.

That said, the fact it plays quick was enough for me to rate it a 7 instead of a 6.  Games with a lot of randomness need to be quick games and this does accomplish the fun in a short time.

Update: Dropping to a 6 after 3 plays.  It's just too light for my taste to rate any higher.  It's good for a sporadic play here and there.  The shine is wearing off quickly.

7 Wonders was a game that I initially found very attractive.

a very fun card game. The theme is lost due to the card draw and placement focus. You do not get a sense of building but rather playing cards. Otherwise a very nice and tight stretchy game with lots of replayability. Not is good as Dominion. Similar to race for the galaxy but easier to learn but same amount of strategy.

Players whip through three epochs building up a card based civilization.  Uber-quick game where players choose a card and either build it for function, trash it for gold, or use it as one of the three foundations for their wonder.  Repeat 17 more times, passing your cards around the table, so they circulate.  You also have six battles with your neighbours.  Tote up points for all sorts of things 25 minutes later. Beautifully designed super-filler, gorgeous art (although the icons could be clearer), and it garnered an immediate repeat play.  Turns are blisteringly fast, in fact it feels a lot like playing Spacebeans, if that makes sense.

Tactical, but difficult to play strategically.  Not much tuning your engine to be better at something - just choosing where you'll be taking your points.  A bit thematically dry.

Played 3 rounds of this with the neighbors. I managed to win all 3 times; Ali and David tied all 3 times (twice for second, once for last).  I think everybody had fun, though Candace may not have.
Neat mechanics with the resource building and buying from your neighbors (unless you need one more stinking glass and nobody has it!).

03/23/2012: Having played additional games of this with the neighbors and about 5 games with coworkers, this is a really good game.  No one strategy is dominant over the others.  Already purchased Leaders, and can't wait to try that out.  Only real ding is that Science (Green) seems to be an all-or-nothing strategy.

05/02/2012 - got to try out leaders this past saturday, and it was a LOT of fun. I got Rome as my wonder and nobody else really embraced the Leaders concept. Not surprisingly, I won; future games with these peeps will definitely involve more leaders.
tempted to raise this to a 9, but there may not be enough variation to justify that.

A favourite in my house that sadly doesn't get played nearly enough! 7 Wonders is a set collecting and card drafting game which is set in the ancient world, when great cities commanded power and architectural wonders were erected to transcend the ages. Players will each lead one of these ancient cities and through three ages of card drafting, build a civilisation, commercial success and military powerhouse to win the game. Card drafting simply put for those who don't know, is where a player has a hand of cards, keeps one, passes the hand to the next player whilst simultaneously receiving the remaining hand of the player on their other side, then puts the kept card into play in the game, paying any costs depicted on the card (in 7 Wonders at any rate, other drafting games do not always require this). In 7 Wonders this happens over three rounds (or Ages) before the game ends and points are tallied up to reveal the winner. Card types include resources which you can use to buy other cards and pay for wonders to be built, which in turn give you additional points, items or powers, military strength, which is tested at the end of each round and the people with higher strengths than their immediate neighbours receive VP whereas those with lower totals get -VP. There are also civilian card which simply give VP, science cards which must be collected into set to score, commercial cards, which give out money and points throughout the game or at the end of the game for various reasons and finally guilds which award points based on the colours of the games in each player's tableau and sometimes those of his/her neighbours. 7 Wonders is a great classic game that I never tire of playing, especially with the various expansions. It plays up to 7 people but 4 or 5 is the sweet number I think, 7 can be awkward as it is more of a team game, while 2 player is downright awful and those out there who generally only play with one other person would be better suited to 7 Wonders: Duel

Quick to teach the rules and short playing time makes this a great gateway game, while still being interesting for experienced gamers. The different wonders are nicely balanced and provide extra replayability.

One caveat is that despite the box saying 2-7 players, it really doesn't work with 2 or 3. Essentially this is a 3-7 player game since special rules are required for 2 players, but it doesn't work well for 3 either.

A good game, but it falls a little short of the hype, to be honest.   Lite civ-building.   The drafting element has a cool wrinkle where you play each card before selecting another.   But, there doesn't seem to be as much "hate drafting" here as there is in Fairy Tale because that game has conditional scoring cards that really require more risk assessment.  One cool thing about this game, however, is that it really plays well with 7 people, which is a rare feat.  With multiple paths to victory, this game should see plenty of plays, but since Fairy Tale scratches the same itch (mostly) in a third of the time, 7 Wonders might not see quite as many plays in my estimation.   Setup time for 7 Wonders is a problem.  I did appreciate that each player's wonder gives different rewards.   But, really, it boils down to "pick a card & play it".  That's all there is.   Rating 7 (ha-ha).

Either I haven't work things out yet or there seems to be something amiss to me.  Throughout the game it is hard to get a feel for the current player placings and therefore you are uncertain of who you are trying hinder.

RATING: 9
A slight-step above a gateway game, 7 Wonders is a classic.  I first played this a long time ago in my early days of Euro-gaming with a not-so-friendly group at a meetup and no one would really explain the rules.  However, I was STILL able to get a grasp of the civilization and engine building aspect of accumulating resource cards to build more cards.  It was logical, intuitive and felt very natural.  
Instinctively thinking I should just try my best to diversify, when the scoring came at the end, I actually came somewhere in the middle range compared to the other players.  With the exception of the Science cards, the scoring is very simple and straight forward.   Often when I introduce this to new/non-gamers, they get this déjà vu feeling they’ve played this before; that’s how instinctive this game is (very much like Splendor).  

While my first experience with it was tainted by the players at that particular meetup, I’ve since played it many times at meetups (with friendlier people) and came to love it.  

The game is fast and a fun activity when you have a lot of players who don’t want to split up into two groups.  As far as strategy, well… while experience at knowing what cards will come up during each age has its advantages, it really comes down to the luck of the draw as to what cards are passed to you.  You can try to block or exploit advantages, but there is a lot of luck in the game.  I’ve seen first time players win a number of times (although they almost always had a LOT of help from their neighbours).  And the scoring at the end is a chore (best to get the computer application to do the math for you).   
The amazing artwork is some of the best I’ve ever seen in a game and gives 7 Wonders a very classy feel.  You very much feel you are building a civilization from ancient times.   

Some people may critique the game for its lack of interaction (especially against players on the opposite side of the table), but the simultaneous selection mechanism eliminates downtime and all players are considering their selections concurrently.  Thus it makes the game feel fast as everyone is constantly engaged in play.   There aren’t many games out there that can accommodate 7 players that aren’t straight-up party games.  That said, I’ve never played this game with less than six players and usually play it with the full seven.

This is one of the most unique games in my collection and certainly one of the most strategic at such a high player count. Its gorgeous art, mixed with its quick play time and its generous player accessibility, make this an awesome game.

[b]5.8.2011 Update:[/b] Now that I own this great game and have the responsibility of teaching it, I have come to realize that it is quite the burden. It isn't on par with teaching a monster like Puerto Rico, but it definitely takes time and ruins the ability to play this quickly if there are any newcomers present. I might have to drop my rating a little.

[b]6.20.2011 Update:[/b] Finally played a 2 player game and I can report that it is fantastic. The ability to use the 'Free City' (we called it Bob) as your pawn to both help yourself and hinder your opponent is very fun. The ability for this game to scale from 2-7 players negates my above setup complaint. Rating stays.

[b]9.6.11 Update:[/b] Two things have this game firing on all cylinders lately: most of my game group finally knows it (therefore doesn't need to be taught) and the addition of Leaders! Rating goes up and added to my Top 10.

[b]8.17.12 Update:[/b] I continue to look forward to playing this game. I never turn down a chance to play it and it always impresses new players. Rating increases and it moves up to #5 in my Top 10!

CLUB COPY. It's OK for a light game. I can't comment much yet as I've only played once.

RATING: 9
I liked this game from my first play, and still do after many more.  It's a wonderful (pun intended) system of interlocking card types, resources, shifting incentives based on your neighbors' actions, variable player powers, and so on.  

There are subtle, but very important, differences in the game when playing with different player counts.  This is due both to the number of shared neighbors as well as the extra cards put into the deck for the additional players.  The game does a good job of balancing these additions, but it's still a little uneven.  
Some deride it as little more than an activity, but I've seen that skillful play will carry you through most of the time.  Yes, you can get screwed by cards clumping up, or by another player who decides to snipe a bunch of things you were counting on, but it is a card game after all.  Yes, playing with the full 7 is kind of chaotic, but show me a 7p game that isn't.  (And I still feel like you have more control than it might seem, at least on local events.)

The game's got great replay value, solid expansion potential, and plays in a fairly short timeframe (though setup can be a bit of a chore).  
If I have one gripe, it's over the changes between the 1st and 2nd printings of the game.  I don't miss the wooden money from the 1st ed, but it was awfully nice to have the wonder names and power descriptions in English.  The newer printings are language-neutral, but that means new players get confused by even more symbols, and have to refer to the manual more often.  
Oh, and while most of the wonder boards are a real choice between the simpler A and more complex (yet still balanced) B side, at least one (Ephesus) is just flat-out better on the B side, and should never be played as A.

RATING: 4
It's convenient that the game scales so well to player counts as high as 7, but the reason it can do it is because of a mostly solitary experience. I don't like draft-and-pass as the primary way of interacting in a game: denying one neighbor one card usually has a limited effect, a high opportunity cost, and is done in secret. Further, the learning curve is surprisingly steep. There are lots of icons for new players to learn. And to play strategically by knowing the odds of future cards coming your way, you really should know all the cards that are in all the decks at each player count. If you don't, early game choices may feel arbitrary, and late game choices may feel like straightforward selections of which cards give you the most VP in each disconnected turn. Sold my copy.

Fun relatively quick game. Works well with 3-7 players as advertised so makes for a good filler game in lots of settings. There's definitely luck involved but there's enough strategy to mitigate the randomness. Solid, not sure how often I'll play it in the long run but certainly worth playing.

RATING: 9
Nice topic, nice game, fast pace. Kids like it.
There is an initial lack of player interaction and a risk that the mechanical optimization of card-picking becomes scripted after a few games.
But the card-passing mechanism forces (unlike Dominion) to balance between scoring high and preventing others from scoring high (kids get that too). Leader extension makes it a bit longer, maybe too long.

Fun at first then it becomes repetitive. The drafting mechanic is nice, every time your strategy changes but in few games you will try them all. It is more fun to play against advanced players, but then again, there are other games.

[b]Update:[/b] After playing more games with experienced players I raised the rating from 7 to 7.7; It's fast and fun and pushes us to play more games in one sitting.
[b]Update:[/b] After few more plays it was evident that 7 Wonders is a blast when playing infrequently, especially when everyone knows what they're doing. Upgraded to 8.3.

RATING: 9
Gyors játék 5 emberrel is, valszeg 7-el sem lehet lassúbb.
Amolyan Dixit a stratégia játékoknál: gyors, pörgős, ugyanakkor itt azért tervezni is kell, és előre látni. Nyilván a kártyák ismerete a játékot pozitív irányba befolyásolja, de ez együtt tanuláskor nem akkora baj. (Mármint, h tudod, h milyen kombók jöhetnek ki, mire érdemes figyelni).
Ugyanakkor az ára erős túlzás kategória, nem véletlen említettem a Dixitet: nagyjából annak ára lenne a reális érte.
Amúgy egy tökéletes játék, van egy party game érzete, pedig nem az - valszeg a sebesség miatt-, és ugyanakkor meg komoly tervezést, előre látást is igényel: mit vegyek ki ami nekem jó, de hagyjam-e bent azt, ami másnak viszont nagyon jól jön, stb.
Igazából a játék nálam 9-es lenne,(kategórián belül, abszolute nézve inkább 8) az ára vitte 8-asra.
Síelésre pl ideális lenne, ha vmi komolyabbra vágynánk, de mondjuk nem egy igaz gamers gamere.
Ugyanakkor a doboz is erős túlzásnak tűnik, kisebb is kényelmesebb lenne, de valszeg már a kiegekkel terveztek.
Amúgy kinézetre jó, minőségre jónak tűnik, és a játék izgalma is megvan, kérdés persze 30. játéknál is megvan-e ez. /Mondjuk amennyit én játszok 1 játékkal, ez nem igazán kérdés/indok/.
Update: Azért a kártyák minősége hagy kivetnivalót...A játékról: azért van benne szerencse adag rendesen, legalábbis kevésszer játszó játékosoknak biztos: jöhet rossz kártya sor folyamatosan, amivel nem tud mit kezdeni a játékos. Ami persze valószínűleg a kártyák ismeretével, és gyors terv váltással kiküszöbölhető.
Az általam eddig játszott 2010-es esseniek közül az egyik legjobb.
Az ár -hisz ez csak 1 kártya játék- ellenére megkapja a 9-est, majdnem :-)
Update x: szóval továbbra is kellemes játék, szerencse elég nagy, de gyors, és picit azért gondolkozós, és 7 fővel is max 1 óra...

This game is as near perfect as you get. No one ever feels left out, there's almost no down time and every game can be won by anyone. I've not played a game quite like this before. I love it. I've not introduced it to anyone who hasn't enjoyed it. There is a bit of a learning curve to this one but once past it, you'll be playing as well as anyone else on the table. The only down side I can see is that once people are very familiar with the game they may know exactly which cards to look for early on in the game giving them a clear advantage, but I don't know how much of an advantage. I'd love to see more cards but the way it plays right now is beautiful.

My new nickname in my gaming circles is Zevin Wonders - short for Zevin wonders why this game was ever made.   That's not true actually, I do respect the game designers for making such a widely received 7 player game that can play in 30-45 minutes.  What just boggles my mind is why everyone likes it so much?  You have limited control over your strategies.  It's not a true drafting game in 5-7 players(which is the number of people who tend to gravitate towards this game b/c of the lack of game choices with that number) because you will never or rarely draft in anticipation of getting something back.  So there is almost always a best card to draft, little to no strategy in drafting something in one pack because you know it combos well with something in another, and in my experience, if you sit next to one or two pacifists, you have about a 99% better chance of winning the game.  Science is rarely viable except when coupled with the leaders expansion or as previously stated if you're next to some hippies that 1 age I warrior can bash into 18 points in your favor.  Some starting civs are significantly better than others.  This game basically comes down to one giant luck box.  All of which I would be totally okay with if EVERYONE didn't ALWAYS want to play this game.  There are 7 of us left at game night.  Me: "Let's play a 3 and a 4."  Others: "Well 7 Wonders plays   7." Me: "sigh..........."  If everyone else out there wasn't so damn enamored with this game I'd aptly give it a rating of a 7.  But thanks to the mindless zombie rending flesh craving this game triggers in otherwise sane individuals, I felt it my civic duty to all that is rational and just in this world to do my part to keep this game out of the top 10 BGG games.  Thus Zevin Wonders, you have a special place in my heart as the only game I've ever rated a 1!  Mazel Tov!   Addendum - I heard through the grapevine that 1 ratings may get thrown out as spam.  I cannot in good conscious let that happen, thus I shall reluctantly raise my 7 Wonders rating to a 5.

I love drafting. Drafting was my favorite way to play Magic back in the day. So that's a plus for me. After five plays I enjoy the game and I'd be happy to play it again, but I am not feeling so eager that I can't wait like I do with many games. I spent a lot of time during the games I played helping to teach others and not worrying a lot about exploring strategies for myself. The five plays I've had don't feel like enough to get a definite picture of how well I'll like the game in the long term. I am very interested in adding it to my collection because it is a good game with a short play time for 2-7 players. I believe I will enjoy it and it will be good for many of my gaming situations, but I'm not necessarily expecting it to become one of my personal all-time favorite games.

Took me a long time to play this insanely popular game.  It's easy to see what makes this so appealing.  For one, it's super easy to learn but provides deep gameplay and difficult decisions.  There is just the right amount of player interaction for my tastes.  The best thing about it is that playtime isn't increased with player count so it plays 7 in the same time as 3.  Really cool and tough to pull off.  I also love that depending on which wonder you are constructing you get a unique player ability.  Really nice game all around.

... this is such a poor game .. Solitaire, but without the fun .. NO interaction/NO tension/NO strategy--NONE -- why is it so highly rated ??? .. just because something is popular, does not mean it is good !! ... (my latest experience listed below) ... just shoot me billy ...

I was caught at TABS into a seven wonders match with seven chairs filled with seven people around a table surely seven foot square ...
... the person on my right nudged me and exclaimed .. 'HA ! my army is all powerful, and will run roughshod over you ! , here is minus one point!' ... and to the person on my left, I gently said , 'oh, I am so terribly sorry, but would you mind awfully much if I bought some wood from you please?' ...

... and the four other individuals across the vast expanse of tabletop, whom I could barely see ... where but in yonder galaxy a far far way away ... nary a shout, nary a wave, nary a nod, nary a wink .... same game . different universe .. I could but fairly be playing solo ....

... we seven, upon finishing seven wonders, embarked yet again, on another seven wonders quest -- and yet again --- galaxies apart, the four disappeared in their rocket ship spreading the word to far flung , as yet, unexplored, vast nether regions ...

... why were the gang of four present ?? why did I play seven wonders, not once, but twice, at the end of a long day in the Canadian legion with but two cups of tea and chips ??? ... upon wrapping the second seven wonders, we proceeded to stack chairs and put away tables -- it was later than late -- the four outer galaxians had returned -- we chatted aboot the moon ; the stars ; the space-ness of space -- the four ruminated upon wonders built ; armies crushed ; wood purchased ; leaders leading ; space conquered -- whilst I -- forlornly gathered my coat, my hat, my bag , and with lonely angst, retired to Bedlam .......

A nice, quick filler that has multiple paths for scoring and scales well. But a bit over-priced for what you get. And printing to the edge of the cards is always a poor design decision, especially when you skimp on the card stock. Cards sleeves were a must. Will see how it holds up to multiple plays.

RATING: 8
With four players game is fabulous.  With three or five players it's decent - there is a little too much to keep tabs on if you're not familiar with the cards. I found the game really horrible with 2 players (I recently played Among the Stars 2 player with a BGG user variant.  You could apply that to this game and I'd like the 2 player more) because the dummy player felt cumbersome. With 6 or 7 players, please refer to the rant below:

This is one of the most consistently silence inducing games I've ever played, except when people see that Altar card for the first time.  Other than that, gameplay usually takes on the atmosphere of a ghost town with chatter only resuming when it comes time to dole out victory points.

All the same, this game has enough sumpin' sumpin' to make me want to play it again.  It's just that every time the game ends I feel a little unsatisfied, a little bit hollow on the inside, like I just drank a zero calorie beverage that wasn't water (me being really bad at the game and not quite understanding it might be a factor here).  Seven people quietly sitting around a table looking at cards.  It's kind of like the museum of board games.  It's pretty to look at, but is it fun to play? 

This game is a wolf in sheep's clothing.  The gameplay itself is simple, but there's a lot going on with card distribution, card types, and how the cards relate to the wonders.  Or maybe it's actually a sheep in wolf's clothing.  At first glance it seems lean and fast, but when you consider how everything interlocks there's actually a ton of delicious fatty meat to chew on.  I think if I could break through the barrier this might be one of, if not my favorite game.

RATING: 6.5
initial rating after a few plays ... rating 6.5 - it feels like a 7.5 after initial playing, but rating goes down with successive plays.... likely will settle at a 6.

pros 

plays fast and has a feel of strategic planning
which will allow you to achieve a certain amount of success.

cons

only an illusion of control or strategy and you're play, aside from guessing what cards you will be passed to you, likely doesn't determine the outcome, especially if there is a weaker player at the table.

i'd rate this as a solid B - happy to play, but more of a fun activity then a game. will not purchase.

This game started as a 7 for me, and now is down to a 4.  I think the issue is the more people you play with, the less fun it is.  3 seems to be the right number; that way each person is interacting with everyone in the game and not just their neighbors.  Eh, I think I'm ready to just see this one leave our collection.

RATING: 10
i love this game!  it plays well with any number, but i especially like it with six or seven.  it is never the same game twice, and i find i can suceed with many different strategies, albeit competing against the successful science card collectors can prove challenging!  we have played this games with nieces and nephews, uber-gamers, old fuddy duddies, and even a neo-gamer college kid from Taiwan, who could barely speak English (she is very smart!).... point is - everyone who plays this with us loves it!  i wasn't sold on leaders the first time i played it, but have come to enjoy it.  will have to rate that expansion separately; and am looking forward to exploring the cities expansion.

I'm not sure why everyone thinks this is so great. It's not a bad game, but I don't understand the hype.

Also, people need to seriously hurry up with their drafting.

RATING: 8
Players draft a hand of cards and choose amongst cards for resources, set collection, trade bonuses, military focus, or cultural buildings. Three hands of cards and the game is over, making it a welcome addition to any game night. It can be difficult to explain the iconography to new players, but once it clicks, everyone seems to enjoy this. Cities and Leaders expansions add some specific strategies that players might otherwise not choose to adopt, which is welcomed. For a game that has short play time as a selling point, it always seems like I want it to last a bit longer.

30-60m, best with 3-5. 20+ plays.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Game that appeals to everyone. Easy to explain, easy to play, fast and dynamic. A success for those who need their games are short. The only downside is that direct confrontation is only done with the players that are on both sides, while the rest did not interact too.

I knew I had to buy this game after one play. It condenses everything awesome about drafting Magic cards without requiring another 3 hours of play to see who drafted the best. 

The design is elegant and extremely easy to pick up. It is the game most in demand when I go to social gatherings. Everyone always wants to play it again. Numerous people I have taught 7 Wonders to have gone out and bought the game a short time after.

When I first bought this game I had a hard time getting it to the table. A lot of my gaming partners deemed the symbols to annoying to deal with and would rather play other drafting games. Overall I enjoy the game but I believe with expansions my rating would be higher.

Have an original version that gets played often. May have to replace at some point because the cards are getting so worn from overplaying!

This game fills a very unique niche: an easily explainable  card drafting game that scales beautifully from 3 - 7 players.  The game time doesn't even increase dramatically with a higher number of players due to the simultaneous nature of the game play.  Sounds great, right?  For a lot of people it is, the game is already rated 73 and it hasn't even become available for the general North American public.  For me, I just found it to be boring and too light for my tastes.  It's not even that I dislike 7 Wonders because I could easily play it if asked to by people.  I just don't consider it to be a game I want in my collection.  I wonder if it's the whole 'drafting is the game' that bothers me.  I'm not fussy on Fairy Tale or 7 Wonders but I love the optional card drafting in Gosu and Agricola.  I wish I could better articulate what aspect of the game makes me feel the way I do about the game, but I can't.  Oh well.

RATING: 6
Having played this over 50 times now, it's starting to wear a bit thin, however I still have fun most of the time I play it. It's frustrating to pin this game down. I can't tell if it's the most brilliant or overrated game I've played. Seems best with three or four. Any more and it's too much out of my control. One of my biggest problems with Puerto Rico is the whole kingmaker aspect of it. It's very present in this game, and probably worse, but at least it only takes 20-30 minutes.

Based on limited plays - I think this will go up when I properly give it time. Minimal downtime, and I actually really enjoy the scoring at the end (which I know frustrates some). Scoring was also very close, important in a gateway game. I wonder how much deepe it gets when you play it lots. I think that, given how quick the game goes, it's very satisfying. Seems to get you thinking without disadvantaging newbies a lot, which is great.

RATING: 6
I could see my initial 9 rating dropping, but after one play, I can't stop obsessing about this game.  That hasn't happened to me in quite a few first time plays.

Yet another initially intimidating, but ultimately simple game.  Once you get through the rules, the game flows smoothly and quickly and you find yourself questoning why the rules explanation took so long in the first place.

Edit:  After several more plays, I really don't enjoy the take a card and pass style of drafting games.  It makes it near impossible to plan ahead and I want strategy, not tactics.  And given it's mostly tactical, it's not well enough balanced for that.  I'd play again at this point, but the mood will have to strike.  I can see the rating drop further.

RATING: 5.75
Engine building game with some interesting mechanics, including hand passing after every turn and multi-use cards. Suffers from weak theme integration and cumbersome two player rules. Dark, muddy art not to my taste. Tiny icons hard for 50 year old eyes, especially when they must be seen in another player's array across the table. As a two player game, rates a 5; with three, a 6.

RATING: 6
Card drafting at its most pure. 7 Wonders does what it does well, but what it does is not particularly interesting. The interaction between neighboring civilization is great in theory, but is rarely strong enough to influence the decisions of players in a meaningful way. The game also feels abridged to a fault, preventing the game from fully embracing its epic scope. There are several different strategies to pursue, which gives the game longer legs than you might otherwise expect, and certainly lends to its popularity. Its certainly a fun game, especially at the medium player counts, but one that has been outdone over time. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
This game should be viewed as a filler, and with proper expectations, can be enjoyed for what it has to offer in about 30 minutes.  I love the angst produced from having multiple great cards to choose among or being forced to pass a card to your neighbor that they can greatly benefit from.  There are five ways to score significant points including military, civilian, scientific, guilds, & some of the player boards and I've seen wins with heavy specialization or diversification.  What path one chooses is strongly tactical so flexibility is a must.

This is a great Multi-player game. There are enough winning conditions so that different paths can be engaged by different players in the same game. The card drafting keeps everyone on their toes, and situationally aware. If you blink, you will miss what your neighbors are doing and could lose the game. The only drawback to this game is that you need a really big table for laying out all the cards and pieces in a 4+ player game.

Bonus pro
--Very easy to get to the table due to being a good support for 2-7 players to get a quick play.


Pros
--Works very well with any applicable player count
--RELATIVELY easy to explain and get an attentive group of non-gamers playing
--Always ends with the sense of accomplishment, whether or not the scoring went well

Cons
--Feels moderately random due to limited strategy options
--Can feel samey after repeated plays
--Not terribly interactive

Overall my satisfaction has waned up and down on this game, where currently it's on a high.  Not a terribly deep game, but, it's great depth for "family game night" and is a very solid filler otherwise.

I am interested in expansions, but this game is a complete box that really needs nothing more. Value is amazing. Plays to 7!

A solid light drafting game that will seemingly scale really well. There's probably more interaction than your standard engine building card game, and more importantly the interaction is more accessable than Glory to Rome or Race. Overall, I thought the game was pretty good, and I see this title having potiential in my group for a go to game for 5+ players. I'm looking forward to future plays. 

60 Plays in and I think I'm done with this title. It's a little too random for my tastes. The expansion definately increased my willingness to move on.

RATING: 9
I loved the Draft-Mechanic in MtG, and I love it in 7 Wonders. Its a great little game that can be explained and played very fast. Sometimes the choice of which card to take card is obvious, but most of the time you really have a tough decision to make. Do I deny my opponent a good card? Do I need money? Do I want to advance my wonder? Do I want to specialize on a certain card type, or scatter the chances over all colors? I also like the choice between different starting-wonders and the great card artwork and the symbols that are easy to read and understand. The only minor letdown is the quality of the cards, but I double-sleeved them, so I don't really care about wear and tear.

Nice game. Attractive components, smooth mechanics and a wide, wide range of possibly strategies.

I can see why this has been such a big hit in 2010. So-called "Civ-themed", plays fast (even with a large group) and interesting tactical decisions to make with (apparently) multiple paths of victory. What I like is that it's not a multi-player solitaire. There's ample interaction with your neighbours and not just through the card-drafting.

But hype is probably just that - hype. The Civ theme is pasted on. It's at heart a "get production then convert to VP" game using a card-drafting mechanism. Which is not to say the game is uninteresting, but the theme could have been anything. If you're looking for a deep Civ theme, this is the wrong game. 

It's also not a very strategic game. Decisions you make are largely tactical (some may say "forced"). There's a lot of "going with the flow". And I'm not sure about the multiple paths to VP thing. Seems like you must go for the green cards to have a shot of winning.

The 'screw your neighbor' component is really lost with more than 3 players because it becomes too difficult to choose cards to affect the game.  The only strategy becomes choosing cards which are best for you.  Science can also be a bit too difficult a strategy to build around, so one entire component of the game is really lost to balance.

RATING: 9
Card drafting is one of my favorite mechanics and it's executed very well in this title. The hype for this game is well deserved for how well the game scales and for the multiple paths to victory. It's not a filler, but it's not a civilization builder either. The iconography presents a small learning curve for gamers, but a large learning curve for casual gamers. The end game scoring can also be cumbersome at first. It only takes two or three games to get completely over the learning curve but it's there. Your first few games will be fairly random as you're not sure which cards are the most valuable at the time.

I don't play it enough to warrant getting the expansions.

Excellent game - nice to find one that will take so many people, and is fast as people make decisions simultaneously.  Building up resources is satisfying and the passing of cards between players adds interest.

RATING: 8.5
A very enjoyable game. All its mechanics interact nicely, there are many paths to victory (which is something rare for a game this light) and the fact that all players play at the same time reduces the downtime to a minimum, for a reasonably short game. Great for introducing people to the gaming world. I've played it dozen of times before finally getting tired of it, but I've heard that the expansion takes care of that.
Be careful though with the unwilling king-making: science victory will always win if no one tries to stop it.

Gorgeous art, appealing theme and interesting mechanics have combined to capture my imagination.  Sadly, scoring is a chore and the non-intuitive symbols make it unnecessarily difficult to teach to new players.  AP-prone players also make the game unnecessarily painful.
Tried the David Weiss solo rules: the AI can be kind of stupid at times, but the game was fairly fun to play.

6 is probably too low because it's such a short game that doesn't offend, but I sure didn't feel like I was building anything. There can't be that much strategy as the 5 player game I played, all 3 new players finished higher than the 2 experts who had 15+ plays. I'd play a few more times to see if there is anything there.

This wasn't as easy to dive into as I thought, esp for non-gamers.  This was disapointing because I thought it was supposed to be more of a family game anyone could pick up. The symbols require a fair amount of reference the first few times through. I think once people play it and get the hang of it they like it.  Most of my plays have been 3-5 players, would like to try with more.

This was the second "hobby" board game that I owned, after Pandemic.  It is relatively easy to play and quick, which brings it to table frequently, however it also seems simple and I'm worried that it'll start to get boring.  It may be time to add an expansion.

RATING: 7
(As of [b]3[/b] plays) A light card game that takes the drafting mechanic of [GAMEID=13823] and uses a thin but mostly effective civilization-building theme to expand upon it. Some strategy involved, but its greatest strength is its ability to accommodate up to seven players without slowing down gameplay. Good for casual gamers, but a bit too complex for non-gamers, perhaps?

[b]1 year verdict:[/b] Hasn't been played often. My regular gaming group isn't very interested, but I am holding on to it as I think it would work well with some of my non-regular gaming buddies. Too complex for my relatives at this point in time.

I'm enamoured with the drafting and simultaneous play at the heart of this game. I also appreciate that players are encouraged to invest in a few different paths to victory, rather than a single one.

RATING: 7.5
A little complicated to teach initially due to the iconography, but lots of fun, especially due to the simultaneous decision element and the fact that the points are generally very close in the end.

The other excellent aspect of this game is that it immediately scales to 7 players, making it one of the few games that we can play when everyone turns up!

I haven't played this one for a long time and it is probably having to go over the iconography again that is the main hurdle to playing again.

Loaned to Tim O'C for Agricola 4/3/17 to October 2017.

Excellent civilization building drafting game. Basically simple to play and scales up to 7 players without taking considerably longer to play, but it's also absolutely amazing with 3 and 4 players. The only hurdle is that the icons take some time to understand. But luckily there's a pretty useful player aid.

RATING: 6
It’s a reasonably good game that came on strong for me but subsequently faded a good bit. The gameplay itself is good – choose one card from a hand given to you and pass the rest to the left. The choices are simple but very tough – to build infrastructure or military or science or just score points? That the game scales well up to 7 people is another plus.

But after several plays of it, the game started to feel samey and the experience stale. The game is simply not that deep after all. A lot of the time you’re guessing, not playing strategically, and the decisions get less interesting as the game goes on, not more. By the last round you’re locked into a strategy and just hoping cards that you need show up. 

It’s OK on occasion for a large group, but when I saw them starting to make expansions, I knew I was out. This is the kind of game that does get samey and does need expansions to liven it up, and I don’t think it’s worth it to chase them. Moved it on and don’t regret it.

Finally gave into the hype and bought it.

I love, love, love:

- the two-player expert variant adding much more strategy
- being able to civ-build in half an hour
- the gorgeous wonder boards on thick cardboard

I dislike:
- the sorta-meh card design--very functional and not super pretty
- that the cards are black-bordered(?!?)

Final verdict: Quick civ-builder that plays simply but deeply.

Not compelling to me, though it works cleanly.  The game is worse with more than 3 people because some pairs of people aren't neighbors.

A true classic, and one of the few games that both unexperienced and hardcore gamers can enjoy. Quick to play, but with great depth of strategy and a number of ways to victory. The expansions add replay value to a game that already has plenty. If you call yourself a gamer, you must own 7 Wonders.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
7 Wonders is a very engaging game that offers many scoring paths and ways to get points.  The ability to purchase and sometimes use your neighbors resources and abilities is quite creative.  At the same time, it is not terrible confrontational: the battle system is just one of the many ways to score points, and the victims aren't crippled by losing and still can even have a chance to win.

What frustrates me is the difficulty with developing a long term strategy.  The cards come as they may, and it seems that you have to build what you can as it comes along.  Sometimes the card flow fits in with your plans, and sometimes not.

The two player "Free City" variant is interesting and almost feels like a different game, seemingly more strategic with many more opportunities to mess with you opponent when controlling the free cities.  

In the end, 7 Wonders is quite a brilliant game.  It's best attribute I think is that it plays well with any number and because of the mechanics, doesn't suffer any increase in downtime as the number of players increases.  It is also one the very few games that is playable, and plays well, with that dreaded number of 7.

There are lots of things to think about in this game... almost to the point where there's too much. 

One of the disappointing things about it is that your card drafting is half (if not more than half) figuring out what cards you might have to keep to deny your opponents vs. drafting what you need. 

It's fun, and short so that if you draft poorly, you aren't sitting around the table for a long time waiting to lose.

This is a very enjoyable game. Perhaps it's because it's so short. Perhaps it's because there are a variety of strategies leading to a win. It seems that the order that you get cards matters a great deal and that of course is completely out of your control. It also seems that a balanced approach to gathering points is more effective than loading up heavily in one or two areas.

After just one game, I had to say I didn't understand what the fuzz is all about. New mechanics, though. I guess the expectations were too high. However, after a number of games, I must say it's almost the perfect family+ game. There are so many strategies to go for, and it's always hard to know which card to pick. The interaction between the players are really great, both when it comes to the military power and resources. The game scales so well. You only need to concentrate on your neighbouring players, except for with the sciences. I love the war fight in this game. The only minus point in this game is a couple of (maybe) unecessary rules when it comes to the names/titles of the cards.

A really solid drafting game, 7 Wonders is reasonably fun, but kind of a bear to teach.  I have most of the expansion content for it, but frankly find myself not using it, even when we have it in play (ie Babel tiles that never get chosen).  I actually appreciate how much theme is put into subtle things - like the Great Wall of China having its name in Chinese characters, and giving you a military boost for using a lot of stone.  Still, it's not a game that I [i]love[/i], and when I'm playing at the higher player counts where 7 Wonders really made its name, I'm more likely to tend towards party games.

Like Puerto Rico, this is another game where I actually prefer the 2p variant.  The ability to "hate draft" using the dummy player adds a layer of strategy and interaction that can often be missing from the higher-player-count game.

During my first plays, I looked at it as multiplayer solitaire, but as I've become more and more proficient, I find that the game has many subtle tricks, and that you really have to see what everyone else is doing.  I once played this 6 games in a row, and it still didn't get old - there are always new tricks to try (and I really sohuld stop the pure science strategies)

Wanted to hate this game but recently played it and it's a fine game. I'd say it's largely solitaire with minor interaction via the draft and goods commerce with your immediate neighbors. Seems like it should be a mess but it is surprisingly not. Once players are familiar with the basic game it seems like most games will be pretty close.

Since it plays so quickly you pretty much have to hope for the best in some regards because you can't always count on getting what you need. Maybe some long-range plan will work out but more likely you'll need to be flexible and make the best of what comes along. Fortunately, it seems like the game offers enough opportunities to make a decent go of any hand. And before you can curse your luck it's over.

Great for a short engine-building game.  Unfortunately, I don't like short engine-building games, and I find this pretty dull.

RATING: 9.5
Unbelievably great fun and depth for the time it plays in.  Lots of replayability!

7 Wonders + Leaders + Cities + 5-7 players = Awesome!

The Leaders expansion works even better with the debt aspect of Cities which makes for a terrific experience.  Combining both expansions makes money more tight by giving players the opportunity to buy one leader card each Era.  When used in conjunction with *both* expansions, it makes the debt aspect even more powerful as it affects more players - and when it does it's quite brutal!  More players also means more opportunity for debt events and other things to mess with you.  Great stuff, and amazing the depth that can still be played in about 45-50 minutes of playtime!  Grade: A+

7 Wonders by itself (no expansions) = 9/10 (still an "A" because it plays well under 1 hr.).

I love the drafting mechanic in this one and there are just enough different types of cards and strategies to make it interesting to play over and over.  I can see needing expansions for this eventually, but I'm sure there will be plenty of them.  The game plays so quickly that you can easily set it up and play a couple at a time, much like with Dominion only more so.

An amazing family game.  No downtime.  Very intuitive game play.  Very tacticial play though.  I wish that the game rewarded more long-term strategy.  Perhaps expansions will help with this.  Leaders expansion is a step in the right direction.

Similar to RFTG, with the simultaneous plays, and very similar phases and goals, but a much more approachable and new player-friendly mentality.

While the focus is still on strategy, there's less of a luck of the draw element, and more of a, gauge the other players to determine your strategy component.

First play may take a while longer than the estimated game time, but the game moves far more quickly when all players are experienced.

Crafty game with a lot of moving parts. With many paths to victory, a good player must find what benefits him the most while hindering others. I love this deep and subtle aspect of the game. While experience does offer some advantage, nothing is guaranteed strategy-wise, making the game sometimes feel a little chaotic or random. 7 Wonders is easy to pick up and scales well (so far, from 2-4). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Only played it once, 2-player. It was fast, fluid and fun. I understand why it has had so much success. I'd happily play it again, especially with more players, but my kids were too young and I didn't see ever getting my copy to the table so gave it to my brother's family.

Update: Having inherited another copy, I've played it a couple more times still as a 2-player game. I love Duel, but I still don't (yet?) see why people dislike the 2-player variant. A game of 7 Wonders can be played so quickly, with interesting and agonizing choices and a breezily fun theme, I respect this design more with every play. I can see how it might benefit from expansions after a reasonable number of plays but then – hey – expansions there are and apparently they're great! My 8-year-old has now played this and adopted it, and I can see it hitting the table relatively often. Huzzah!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Seeems very interesting. Only downside is min. 3 players.
update:
Well, it IS interesting. I like the quick pace and build-up, plus the variable player powers and the short playing time.

More depth would make it the perfect game.

BTW the 2 player variant works very well.

Maybe I should increase the rating.

RATING: 8
Fills a niche: a "dessert" intellectual game, perfect for that last half hour of a long gaming session where the players are too tired for another brain burner but also not in the mood for a pure fun filler like King of Tokyo. 7W may be the simplest game I know that offers interesting, and sometimes agonizing, choices every single turn. It supports more players than my gaming table does and the beautiful artwork does not hurt. After a dozen plays, I suspect that the dominant strategy is to spread investment on all civilization dimensions; specialization is a losing one. The Leaders expansion may mitigate that.

Rating history: 9..8..9,8,9...|8

DEC/11 RATE:9 Played this with 6 people and was completely taken with it. It's not really a civ game, it's a set collecting game that uses drafting, but I like drafting games, and this is more fun for me than Fairy Tale.

DEC/12 RATE:8 Just received this is a trade and played 2 players. It didn't quite have the magic. But I was tired and cranky, so maybe that affected my enjoyment. Or maybe the 2-player game is just not as magical.

DEC/12 RATE:9 I now think the 2-players game is amazing. The additional layers of trying to withhold from your opponent and supply the "fake" players with resources you can buy inexpensive all works very well.

20 plays in: 8. Still solid, but obviously most plays are like other plays. I prefer it with Leaders expansion. (Oh, and forget everything I said about it being a good 2p game. There are so many other, better 2p games.) JUN/15.

RATING: 8
Another interesting card game which begins a genera.  I find it interesting that you interact with people only adjacent to you, yet you are trying to get the best score of all the players.  
     None of the games have lasted over 30 minutes.  Graphics are nice and colorful.  It feels like a well thought out and tested game.
     Another game that lends itself to expansions, I am sure.
     Although I have read that some feel it has similarities to Dominion or Race for the Galaxy, I don't agree.  Yes, they are all card games, and you are building something, and the most victory pts. wins the game, but the mechanics on all 3 games are so different.  I own all 3, love all 3, and could play all 3 back to back and not feel redundant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
After several plays I've come to the conclusion that this is a game of chance.   I have sometimes struggled to get a key resource because the right card has never come round.  Also if the neighbouring players don't bother with army building it's very easy to pick up VPs cheaply.  
I have only played it with six or seven players and it may play differently with small numbers.

Received as a gift in a local Secret Santa exchange. Thanks! Very cool and original, and I can see how it could be highly addictive. My wife likes it too! If only we'd discovered it before we became parents, it probably would have become our latest "go-to" game, alongside Carcassonne, Ticket To Ride, Kingsburg, etc. I've had some other successes introducing it to new players: it's incredibly easy to teach.

If you're an iPhone/iPad user, I strongly suggest the 7 Wonders Companion app: it's a lifesaver during scoring. There's an Android app too, but the iPad app is nicer and gives you another Wonder to play with.

7 Wonders 七大奇蹟 3-7(4)
After 20 plays of 7 Wonders, with expansion Leaders and Cities, I still crave for more opportunity to play. With Leaders, it adds a nice layer of strategy to the already-thinky game. With Cities, it adds more interaction between players. I was very fond of this game right out of the bat at the first play. Though my group of friends had shut it off completely with distaste. Over the years, me and one other had persisted and insisted to play 7 Wonders despite their mockery with numerous tries, and eventually we prevailed! We have changed their perception with time and shown them how good 7 Wonders is. I appreciate the design of the game a lot; in particular it is probably the only game that can accompany large group and be finished under and hour with right dose of complexity and weight.

+Great art/theme

This game is a favorite with my fiance and friends. Set up time is low, game play is quick, and the rules are fairly easy to teach. The scoring is a little difficult for some new players, but overall this is a good game to get people playing board games

RATING: 7
One of my first exposures to card drafting games

Pros
-Plays quickly (30 minutes)
-A few paths to victory
-Player interaction
-Drafting is fun
-Different civilization powers (each civilization also has an alternate set of powers) - seems to be they are all very balanced
-Game scales with number of players well (you have to add or remove specific cards)

Cons
-Player interaction only occurs with players on your left and right (an issue when there are many players)
-How well you do depends on the people to your sides
-Need to keep track of what resources people have (minor)
-Fine line on balance of power when there are few players
-Difficult to explain how to pay for building to non-gamers (resources are not income and refresh each turn instead of being consumed)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fast card-development game that takes up to 7 players; the art looks amazing. The interaction could be strategic rather than tactical, but I can't say for now.

I've been suspicious of the massive hype, and "but it's fun!" responses to criticisms of shallowness and lack of replayability. I really enjoyed my first several plays of the game but have cooled somewhat.

Race for the Galaxy has far more depth in the same playtime; Dominion has more variety. 7 Wonders seems to repeat the same scoring methods each game, just with different balances.

Despite having the promo, I'm of two minds about actually getting the game.

The mechanics of 7 Wonders are simple. It's a simple concept that allows for the different types of cards to really shape the fun in the game. Overall I really like 7 Wonders, and I like it more and more every time I play it. I do think that expansions with new card types will really help this game open up to more variety and strategy. 

Oh, and the artwork by my favorite artist (Miguel Coimbra) doesn't hurt either.

RATING: 7.5
I like it, even though it feels highly tactical. I love that it's short enough to be liked among gateway gamers, I love that it's a game you can play with just 2 people, or 7 people! 

At the same time, I don't find it ingenuous (which is why I am surprised at how popular it is), and I wonder if it can sustain my interest over the long run. I think the people I have played this with are prone to sticking to the same strategies, making every game very similar.

RATING: 5
Good game from time to time. Good replayability and artwork.

A lot of options and dilemma when choosing a card :
- should i open the game with that resource ?
- should i go for military to anticipate the end of the turn ?
- should i let myself collecting scientific buildings ?
- should i put in my tableau this huge 8 points civil building ?
- should i discard this card or build my wonder to prevent my neighbor to take it next turn ?

The choice must be made by paying attention to your opponents.

Still trying to find a strategy but it seems very difficult as it depends upon the number of players and indeed of your wonder.

However, I have two complaints :
1/ it isn't a civilization game as it is written almost everywhere
2/ you don't feel yourself building a wonder

EDIT : want to try 5 players configuration. Until now, for me, 4 players configuration is the best one.

EDIT : do not want to play it with more than 4 players (less control)

I didn't care for it.  It just didn't seem like there were enough choices.  Once you start down a route, you have to continue.  I'll play it if it's on the table, but I won't buy it. (11-22-10)

Updated 11-20-12...well it's been 2 years since the first review and a rating of then 5.  I now would like to say I own all of the expansions and am moving my rating up to a 7.75  It is an interesting game, I still think if you miss draft in the first round though there is no escape.

Un juegazo que ventilas en 30 minutos + o -, pero que en ningún momento te da la sensacion de ser un filler, sino un juego con importantes decisiones tácticas. Se puede jugar bien desde 3 a 8 jugadores (con la expansión), presentando según el número distintas sensaciones, cuantos menos más control, cuantos más el caos se hace patente.
La interaccion entre jugadores es limitada, si bien siempre puedes "perjudicar" a alguno con tus acciones, o beneficiarte de sus recursos o construcciones.
En fin, buen juego, muy adictivo y felizmente poca duración lo que te permite encadenar varias partidas pudiendo hacer un "minitorneo".

Quizás si lo jugásemos mucho más en el mismo grupo y lo exprimiésemos, tendría esa tensión que noto que le falta. Dicho esto, es un juego que me gusta y que jugaría más.

All I have to say is this game brings me back to the very first computer game I ever played - Age of Empires.

The same basic premise (with less stress on military prowess) exists, but the game is more fun to me at least due to the highly social yet competitive nature of the game.

I don't know of a game that fits as much strategic decision making into such a short period.

It plays a great range of player counts, has great art, etc. - it's just a great game.

Talking about card games, I preffer, deeper games as Race for the Galaxy, for example.
In the other hand, 7W is a light, fast paced and funny game! The people that I've taught this game always say they liked it a lot.
About it's components, I'd like to mention that are very mediocre (specially talking about the quality of the cards), but despite that, I think 7W is very recommendable to play with family, non-gamer friends and for short game sessions.
Finally, I'd like to say that IMO 7W is over rated in the BGG's boardgames rank.
So... not the best, but not too bad; not too complex, but fast paced and funny... Certainly you geeks will hate or love it. No middle ground!

RATING: 7.9
Nagyon érdekes, elég egyedi mechanikájú játék. A kártyák miatt van a szerencsének is szerepe, főleg több játékos esetén, de azért jól lehet benne kombinálgatni. A grafikák gyönyörűek, a kártyákra kell egy védő, mert nem annyira bírják a strapát. Egyetlen hibája talán, hogy a működés és a téma viszonya nem túl szoros. Nem nagyon tudom beleélni magam abba, hogy én most itt egy ókori civilizációt épitgetek. 
Bármikor szívesen játszok vele egyet, biztos hogy nem fogok megválni tőle.

I don't mind this game, and would be happy to play it again, but it is for me the most wildly overrated game on BGG. Oh, and I REALLY don't want to be in a game with more than about 4 players, because it's just too weird to have someone across the table from you win when you had virtually zero chance to influence their play or even be aware of what they were doing.

Good card game that scales well all the way up to 7 players. Lack of player interaction hurts it a little but still a great game for a big group.

RATING: 6
A civilization filler card game. Gameplay is rather simple, certainly much more so than, say, Race for the Galaxy or even Dominion. You receive 7 cards, choose one of them to play, and pass the rest on to the next player. Cards provide resources or money which allow building more advanced cards, or victory points right away.

There is a little bit of strategy in the card drafting with fewer players, but with more, it becomes entirely tactical. It's going to be interesting to see if the game can hold up with further plays. It is, however, a little too simple for its own good and doesn't offer enough diversity to be steadily engaging.

Very nice, easy game.
Pro: with every player-card you have to play differently (different powers), that makes it more changeable and entertaining. Nice card drafting system which allows the game to get harder as the players improve. different ways to win.
Con: you will have to play a few times to consider all factors, cards still in play and other players movements. But that is also a pro of this game.
You don't know who wins until the very end, that's something I particularly don't like at games.

Finally had a chance to play this game. After having played duel, this came across as much breezier. At first I was disappointed by the lack of depth, but though a couple plays, I came to appreciate it for what it is. I liked that it wasnt too crunchy. It can handle its full complement of players just fine. as long as you understand that its not a mega complex game, its great for new and or casual gamers alike.

RATING: 8
This is a nice mix of strategic choices and ad-hoc decisions. The different boards aren't perfectly balanced but it is good enough to enjoy the game and have a real chance of winning. You have to find a way to maximize your points but also have an eye on your neighbours. Sometimes it is more important to deny them a card than to play a certain card you want.
The game scales quite well with up to 7 players without adding much downtime. I like it a bit more with 3-4 players as you see most hands twice and can plan ahead what propably will come back to you.

RATING: 8
Good production values: cards are fine; cardboard chips, battle victory tokens and player's wonder boards are good quality.  The art is good, nothing mindblowing, but solid.
The design of the game is good and clever. It doesn't feel very thematic, because you focus more on resource management, getting victory points and hate drafting, but still, you are building a city/civilization on your board, so the mechanics match the theme just fine.
Gameplay is fast (45 min per game), with some good tactical decisions to be made, but not a lot of strategy. Knowledge of the cards and resource management is key here. It's not a gateway game, because for a non gamer there is a lot of stuff to keep track of (what resources do I have, which ones do I need, what buildings can I buy for free, how to score points, how to use science cards, how to limit the points of my neighbours, etc.), but it's not a difficult game to explain, understand or play, just really difficult to win if you don't have the experience. A new player will need some plays (from 2 to 5 probably) before he or she can roll by themselves. It's a really good second step game, with a little more depth to it, but still fairly easy.
To sum up, the game is fun, not complex, but with different options, difficult choices and good replayability because of variable powers of the wonders and number of different cards. And finally, it scales really well, up to seven players!

Requires at least a second play to understand the differences and ramp-up over the three ages.

Received two copies, one from Game Surplus and the other from CoolStuff on December 13, 2010. A third copy from Thought Hammer arrived on December 14, 2010 (which I sold to a friend).
2/16/11 - 22 plays later I rated it: 9.5 . Not quite yet ready to give it a 10 but I do think this one will ultimately be the most played game I own. Excellent filler. Best game I've found for my family. A great lunch-time game. It moves quickly, no down time, scales from 2-7, offers just enough decision-making to keep in interesting, but not so much that AP sets in. It's fun to play. If luck enters in, then it is light enough and quick enough that no one gets bent out of shape.
Why not rate it a "10." If it has staying power, and if it were a tiny bit more strategic, there would be no doubt.

RATING: 6
Not enough strategical variance; does not hold up well to repeat play.  At a table of 4+, there are people that might as well not be at the table with you.

It's cute, and I typically enjoy card games, but this one is even more fluffy than I expected.  It was on my wantlist after the first play, but quickly fell off after I got to play it several times.

I haven't tried the expansions but it's possible they add more meat; my rating is "as is" out of the box after several plays both f2f and against the AI.

Blacktown Gamers - 4 player - - nice instruction and game, definitely worth a try again (provisional 8) (2/1/11). After a few games, I'm less enamoured with the game. Like the concept, not thrilled with the scoring. Willing to give it a few more goes, but probably would not suggest, so rating drops from an 8 to 6 (19/6/12). Game at CanCon14 has increased my interest - rating up to 7 (26/1/14). UPDATE I like it, just not as much as many others (Rating 7.152 Jan 17)

3-7 players, best with 4

Nice mechanics, but I want more out of it.  Like 7 ages instead of 3.  It just feels a little too insubstantial; but still a solid classic.  Have not yet explored the expansions; perhaps they will bring deeper gameplay, but I don't believe they extend the length of the gameplay.

7 Wonders is a great game that works well with 4, but gets better the more players. It can be played with the family and is not too difficult to teach and learn. There is a good variety of strategies to win and the puzzle to get as many points as possible is very interesting. I do wish the game had a little bit more interaction as you are very focused on your own cards and then a little on your neighbors, but still this is a great game.

Also own:
-Leaders: I like the Leaders expansion as it gives you a few more important choices to make over the course of the game.
-Cities
-Babel: Have only used the great projects yet, which was an interesting addition. Will have to play this more.

7 Wonders is a real interesting card game and takes a different approach to set collection mechanics that I highly enjoy.  It is easy to understand, fast to play and it is really helped along by the almost simultaneous game play that can happen.  It readily supports between 3-7 players. The artwork is beautiful. The card drafting mechanic is solid and feels unlike other games. 7 Wonders is a statement of gaming and a prime example of how great a card game can be.

RATING: 6
Mindlessly enjoyable with a fiddly setup that makes it less friendly to play. To be specific, When I say 'fiddly' I mean selecting cards for the number of people playing and all the "bits" - it's not a big deal, but makes it not totally gateway friendly (not to mention the icon-itis).

RATING: 5
Pretty quick game that scales decently well up to 7 players. Good introduction to drafting mechanics, but not much beyond that.

Outcomes are way too dependent on how the cards happen to be shuffled into packs. Players are forced to choose a strategy by the end of the first pack [if not before!] and if the cards you need are bunched into one pack in either later round you are toast.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Best with 2 Players! 
With more than 2, esp. if they are new to the game, probably a 7 or 6.9 - it slows the game down too much.
The "dummy player" mechanic in 2p works very well, makes the game more strategic and adds some depht.

The game was OK, but I never thought it lived up to all the hype I had heard about it. I may have to play it few times before I fully grasp the feel of it. I played it at Gamestorm 2014, but wasn't really enjoying myself that much because I didn't feel trained up enough on it to know what I was doing, and I wasn't getting a lot of useful help.

The simultaneous action selection helps keep the play time down no matter how many are playing. 

For me this is more interesting that alternatives such as 'Sushi Go' that shares the card drafting and set collection mechanics because it also has an touch of resource gathering/engine building. Not to mention a more interesting theme.

The first two times I played this game it felt like a solid 9, but my rating declined quite rapidly after that. After a few plays when everyone already knows the rules, it plays way too fast (20-25 minutes) for the winner to feel like his/her victory is well deserved. Still, I wouldn't mind a game or two if someone suggests it, and now I class it as a good gateway game for non-gamers.

7 wonders definitely has it's fans but I am not one.  This game is highly one dimensional, and it's one dimension is usually a small part of other games - drafting. 

Not to say you can't strip something down to it's bare essentials and have a pure and strong game, but 7 Wonders isn't that game. In fact I find the game highly suspect after a few plays.  It seems players not knowing the nuances of the game have just as much chance to win as others do.  

Recently I played a game after long hiatus, and had forgotten what most cards did.  I played against 4 other strong players (who have played this game alot) and to my amazement, after playing rather ho-humly , I won by a country mile.

Designs like this are the equivalent to chewing on a cloud.  Harmless and tasteless and not very filling.

Save the hype for a better game!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
This is a decently fun drafting game that takes entirely too much energy and time to teach to the table, at least in contrast to the lightness of the game itself. I'll probably end up ditching it in favor of the two-player version.

A great lighter game.  There is enough game here to sink into a bit, but it moves quickly and rewards thinking ahead. While there is some planning / strategizing, particularly in the 2 player variant, the way cards are dealt adds some elements of surprise.  Overall, I liked this game a lot!

I saw a meme that summed up 7 Wonders perfectly, it said:

Round 1:  What am I doing?
Round 2:  Why are we going the other direction?
Round 3:  I'm confused.
Scoring:  Oh!  I get it!  Let's play again!

This game is a good, mildly vicious, game.  It's one that is great if you have limited game time (45 minutes or less) or you just want a quick game before long games.  Simple play; pick a card to take or buy each pass through three rounds.  Complicated scoring (have someone good at math!).

The quintessential gateway drafting game. There is a reason this one is on top. It plays fast with any player count. It has interesting decisions to be made throughout the whole game. Various scoring paths and each wonder gives you an different feel to how you should approach the game

Lots of modules and expansions out to enhance this game. The only thing I'll say is I prefer it with about 4-5 as there is a better chance of the cards coming back to you once.

Fun game with little-to-no downtime. My main issue with it is that it can feel like it is playing itself in that your options seem to dwindle more and more and often you end up playing the only card that makes sense... no other options work, meaning you really only had one option to begin with.

Wow! I mean - WOW! I wasn't expecting anything good. But it IS good. The game works, has many levels of gameplay, interesting way of interaction (rather subtle) AND is interesting. At the end it seemes like I was playing on the autopilot, but all in all it was a pleasent experience. I'd be glad to play more.

EDIT
After playng Greed - 7W seems really uninteresting - too much of building up for next rounds with uninspiring cards with no other effect - OH! I just got a stone!... or maybe I'm just getting old. :)

RATING: 5
I don't know how to categorize this game.  It's somewhat like a light Race for the Galaxy or Glory to Rome, yet there does seem to be a little more interaction.  Not as 'solitaire' as I expected or heard it to be.  A good game that plays very quickly.  May get tiresome after a while, but plays in so short a period of time and accommodates up to 7, so may be a keeper.

Much better with 4 players than 5.

Every game feels quite similar.  There is a real lack of "freshness" after the first few games.  I'd much rather play Dominion or RftG than this, unfortunately.  I can see why some people would really enjoy it, but not for me.

Fantastic civilisation building card game. Accommodates up to 7 players (which is great!!) yet, due to its almost simultaneous turn system takes roughly the same time every game.

7 Wonders has to be one of my all-time favorite games, primarily because it is so flexible. It can play up to seven at a time, but because everyone acts together each round it still doesn't take very long to play even with a full table. It's relatively easy to play and every game is different. I hope to see more games come along with similar mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Wonderful game that easily plays within 30 minutes if everyone knows the rules. New players might feel overwhelmed with the iconography during their first play. This usually goes away by the second time they play. By this time they will also know what type of cards to expect during the second and third age which is another fact that might influense the enjoyment of the first game.

RATING: 3.2
Game with 7 players devolved into a collection of independent, simultaneous, local games between your neighbors.  The best player has no way to "bubble out" of such a scheme, being trapped as a local maximum.  Moreover, the gameplay itself was not immediately obvious as a first-time player, biasing greatly toward those who are more familiar with the rules.  The gameplay is alright for a large group of people, but not really that much fun (and with more people, turns into independent games as noted above).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Not entirely sure yet. The art is beautiful, but the components are pretty poor. The price is high, considering what you get for less, also from Asmodee, in games like Claustrophobia.
The game play is definitely more interesting than Fairy Tale, but takes longer. And I have yet to see how much it boils down to solitaire, since blocking seems more difficult than Fairy Tale (where you can discard 2 of your 5 cards).
I still want to play with fewer players. I imagine there is more strategy involved when you are able to see cards passed to others again when they come around a second time.

UPDATE - I've enjoyed this much more in my recent plays. The components in the new edition are stellar (love that my card sleeves fit!), and we've been enjoying the 2-player variant quite a bit.

Acquired December 2010 

October 2011 - Our family group has really enjoyed this game during the past year. It has quickly become one of my favorite games, and I expect we will play it for many years to come. The fact that it plays in a short time frame, with up to seven players, makes this ideal for us. It is an outstanding design, and must have been extensively play-tested before publication.

November 2012 -- This is still an amazing game, to me. I would enjoy playing it more often, because I tend to forget the best tactics between game times. Maybe we will get it out more this coming year.

2013-November:  I have enjoyed this game every time I've played, although I have seldom won it.  It's just a great game.

Feb 2013: Just got this game. We've only played it once, but I afEB lready love it. Update: Play this weekly with my lunch game group at work. LOVE IT!!

Update Dec 2013:  Downgraded from 10 to 9. Have played a few more times. Still like it very much, but it just doesn't have quite the same appeal after several games.  I am finding it fairly tedious to teach new players.  It's supposed to be easy to learn, but I'm just not finding that with most new players. My best 7 Wonders Pupil was a 9 year old boy at a family game party.

It's nice to have a game that functions well up to 7 players, and I like drafting mechanics. It does take up a *lot* of space and it's hard to play well until you fully understand scoring, which makes it a little messy for the first-timer.

Update: After another exceedingly dull session of this gussied-up pass-the-crap game, I'll do my best to pass on this crap from now on.

Another title in the growing list of multiplayer card combo construction games. At least this one has the blessing of simultaneous play, so no long waits for it to end. It doesn't bother me enough to want to avoid it. 

Fluffy confection for those with hearts that go all a twitter over the sight of a killer combo.

RATING: 4
Not a bad game, but nothing great either.  I never get the sense of actually building anything.  Compare that to the rather similar Among the Stars, where I get to build my own awesome city of a space station.   It's neat that it supports 7 players, but then it is very difficult to plan on getting any particular cards.  I just played for the first time in a couple years.  I won a 7P game (by 1 point), but still didn't feel much accomplishment.

RATING: 6
A light worker placement civilization building card game - what more could you want. You have just 3 lots of 6 turns to select (draft) a card from an ever shrinking hand of cards with which to gain resources, buildings, and VPs. Each turn you select and action one card and then pass the remainding cards of that hand to the player on your left and recieve the remaining cards of another hand of cards from the player on your right - I think I'm feeling dizzy. No direct player interaction but you must be conscious of what the other players are doing in order to avoid passing on a card that could profit them to much. Scales brilliantly for up to 7 players - it is mostly multi-player solitare! Components/art are good but not outstanding.

Great filler type card game! There is a sense of strategy and building of your own city which appeals to lots of the people I play with...but you really have to pay attention to your neighbors and spend some brain-burning time running the best options through your head points wise. It's one of those games I'd enjoy playing once on a game night...but then move on to something else. (Whereas I could play 2-3 games of Dominion.)

RATING: 8.25
Best feature is how well it scales for multiple players as everyone takes turns simultaneously.

Simple basic mechanic of drafting 1 card from hand...and passing on hand. Card has a primary use but also two other possible uses which increases the options and thus choices.

Helps to know something about how cards change in each age else can get somewhat stuck later...but easy to tell new players about that.  In essence the first round (age) is about building your production engine, whilst the last age is about scoring victory points - with middle round being a mix.

Nice that there are several viable strategies (i.e. different paths you can choose to get VPs), with decision of what card to draft providing the tactics.

Interaction is important, is with your neighbours and is generally indirect.

This game is LOADS of fun. I love the drafting mechanic. Some decisions are easy; others are excruciating. I'm not sure if the rating will come down with repeated play - I think I've only got 3 or 4 games under my belt - but until then this is a well-deserved 9.

RATING: 7
In a full 7-player game I got locked out of resources and couldn't build past the first wonder. I typically loathe games where I can't do anything truly useful during my move (see Catan), but I'm still intrigued by the many paths to victory players usually have. At least this one doesn't overstay its welcome like epic games of punishment such as Eclipse.

I heard a lot of buzz about this game, and I must say I was very dissapointed. Not only was it extremely light, but it was quite boring. How is this any better than other card games out there. RftG, Innovation, Thunderstone, Dominion are all more enjoyable than this. I have become very skeptical of new card games at this point, and this is exactly why. The only innovative mechanic is passing cards to other players after a play, but it usually results in minor strategic decisions. I also very much disliked the placement of information. Cards stacking on cards makes it difficult to read what each building is, and if you splay them, each players board takes up a huge amount of area. Won't play again unless there is little to no choice and I'm bored.

The more I play the more I love it.  Fits most types of gamers.  My wife loves conflict and is more of an ameritrasg fan, where as I am more of a euro guy, and we both love it.  For the conflict players you can build a whole game plan designed to grab a variety if cards while actively selling off or building wonders with what other people are building around, while the euro gamer can at the same time play their hand without looking at anyone else, and both can be very successful.  At first glance and after the first game or do you may think the game isn't very deep, yet somehow everyone I've taught it to had told me that after a night of playing it they woke up that night thinking of strategies and ways to play out their wonders.  Great game!

I really like this game, but for some reason it doesn't make it to table quite often enough.  Getting up to speed with the rules takes a couple turns so if you're not playing regularly (or if you have a new-to-game player) then each time you play there's a steep learning curve.  It really is a tremendous game, though.

Very nice game, plays fast but still manage to offer you interesting choices. Not sure how well it plays with 2 players.

You draft cards while playing one each turn, using resources that you and your neighbours produce.

It's incredible how much the game is influenced by other players' choices: you only interact with people on your left and your right, but (without direct conflict) you have to take in account their choices.

Distrust expansions: just like many other simple and fast games, it does not need it. It has replayability enough and does not need the elongating addition of leaders.

RATING: 6.5
Pro: the game is quick and has some depth. Con: not much strategy, more tactics, quite a lot of luck because you give most of your cards to other players. Overall: good game, but surely not a connasaire game - too quick and without serious depth.

Fantastic short game, I also own Mannenken Pis, Catan Island and Leaders expansions. A really nice filler and along with Carcassonne my only entry level game. In my book Seven Wonders is a tad above Carcassonne although both are just excellent little games. Only drawback is the quality of the deck, but this can be solved with special sleeves. Fast, funny, easy to grasp, and very recomendable for beginners but very funny for gamers too, an instant hit and a classic. Deserved hype, two thumbs up for this wonder of the boardgame world.

What i like:
-30 minutes play regardless of the number of players
-plays well from 3 to 7 players
-game's art
-easy to play with multiple strategies and without broken ways to win
-a great game to attract non-gamers to the boardgaming world
-Family game with a nice theme

What i dont like:
- if you dont have a standard gaming group, sometimes its taking time to setup the game(discarding-keeping the corresponded cards to the number of players etc)
-The only way to stop someone, is by denying him some cards.
-Players' interaction is minimum to none (wars at the end of each Age is the only real interaction to the game)

Bought in October 2012.

This is one of the most popular games at the monthly night I host, [guild=1459][/guild]. I've taught it to loads of people and almost all of them follow the same pattern: overwhelmed at first, takes them one whole game to understand what's going on (I always warn them that this will be the case!), but they immediately want to play again.

I've played it loads and still find it fun. The simultaneous play means that even 7-player games are quick.

The 2-player variant is also surprisingly interesting.

One of my favorite games to play with 7 players.  It seems like it is more difficult for people to understand with the pictography on the cards.  I keep thinking that it is a game that non-gamers can learn, but they typically seem to have trouble with it.

I have both expansions, and the extra wonder pack, though I've played with the base game much more than with the expansions.

One of it's best qualities is that it doesn't take any longer the more people you add.  It just packs a lot into a short amount of time.

I think the ipad scoring app is great, and makes that part of the game go pretty quickly.  I've never actually used the Cupertino wonder though.

My husband and I like 7 Wonders and rate it a 7, but I don't think that it will become a favorite 2-player game for us. Although the free city (dummy) mechanism works well, it slows things down because the players take turns selecting and playing a card for the free city. This means that one player's turn tends to take twice as long as the other's, and the added downtime in a game that is designed to have no downtime at all dampens the fun a bit. Still, we enjoy exploring various strategies and seeing their results, and we are glad we have this game in our collection.

Extremely disappointing. Your place in the table, your Wonder and the cards you receive will condition most of your chances to win, rather than the very limited set of tactics you are offered. Not complex enough for gamers, too complex for non gamers, will be a hit for those who found Catan or Carcassone amazing. The fact that one my gaming groups loves it is exasperating and "forces me" to buy some expansions in order to see if this can improve and become a game determined by skill and not luck.

Side note: their first game they will be utterly confused. Right after they finish, their light bulb will turn on.

Filler game

Side note 2: I'll never turn this game down because it's so fast and easy to play, even with alot of people. That being said, even though people react to each other, there is not alot of confrontation with other people. Well you do use other people's cards to a point. Anyways if you want blood, it won't be found here

This is the gateway game that brought me to BGG. I really enjoyed this game. Simultaneous turns really cuts down on the problem of Analysis Paralysis and twiddling your thumbs while your opponent takes their turn.

I think I just really don't think drafting is a great game mechanic? I mean this is a good game, but it's never wowed me. I prefer Fairytale as an actual game and Sushi Go for teaching someone a new game or for new gamers. 

Seasons is better too if you want a crunchier draft. The only thing this has going for it really is being "old reliable" in that every one knows it and is comfortable with it. 

-problems with drafting mostly being accessibility due to cardpool knowledge, the cool thing is playing the card and doing the effect rather than just picking it, and it takes a long time to essentially just pick cards

Great game with excellent aesthetics and theme.

Pros:
+ Impressive artwork,
+ Well made smooth mechanics,
+ Game has very short play time - half an hour or maybe less (if players know rules well),
+ The game is strategic and interactive - players are quite dependent on other players actions, however game itself has low random chance.

Cons:
- Replay value is not very high, however, if you are playing game quite rare and not many times in row, replay value is still decent and you get some new experience in game,
- Resource cards are meant to be put under Wonder's board,  but it's not very convenient to do that,
- If you want to play game many times or very often, you will probably need expansions, because it will be not enough variety and replay value with just base pack.

Personal: best about this game is that it works good with 3 and with 7. The draft mechanic is one I love (like in Notre Dame). Can have the feeling that some strategies are too powerful at the beginning, but you will find it is not the case. This is that kind of game that fits perfectly the duration of the game with what you expect from an easy game

Exp Cities: Not a bad expansion, although things included are not so needed. The diplomacy and the credits are goo, but not basic to enjoy 7 wonders

Exp Leaders: adds one round and the feeling that you have some strategy to follow during the game

7 Wonders may just be the most versatile game in my collection. It's easy to play, only lasts about a half an hour, and scales equally well from 2 to 7 players. That's a valuable game that slides neatly into a lot of different situations.

There just aren't many games for six or seven players that play as smoothly and effortlessly as this. It works so well because you really only need to pay attention to your immediate left and right neighbors. Because of its facility at handling a large table of players, I think a lot of gamers mostly play 7 Wonders at the upper end of its player scale. But if you've never tried it with just two or three players, you should!

At the lower player scale, there's more opportunity for planning and more ability to steal valuable cards from your opponent. Getting passed each deck multiple times definitely adds some meat to the game. The two-player version is the meatiest of all. With two, both players alternately control a neutral third player. You'll want to use the dummy player to help yourself and screw your opponent - which proves to be a lot harder than it sounds.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
7 Wonders never gets old, with or without the expansions. The drafting mechanic is absolutely great, turns are short, fast and furious. The fact that cards are revealed simultaneously significantly shortens the time it takes to play the game. This does not limit the multiple strategic options you have. I personally tend to go for a technology victory, but since my friends now this I like surprising them once in a while. While in essence you are playing cards, the beautiful board and cards make me really think that I'm building an empire.

This game is all about "drafting." If you don't know what that is, then think of a large family gathered around the dinner table. 
Dad takes a plate of assorted meats, and picks out the particular cut he wants. He then passes the plate to mother, who does the same, but when it reaches the third or fourth family member, most of the best cuts are gone, or the specific favorite you were looking for is already sitting on brother Biff's plate. 
And Biff,that sniveling but-monkey, will use his prime cut of beef to wage bloody war against you, costing you precious victory points. Maybe you sister took all of the "science" meat that you were trying to accumulate, or you took that one slice of baloney, not because you wanted it, but because you know cousin Freddy desperately wants it, and there's no way you're going to let him have all the baloney, so he can make a sandwich later; a sandwich that lets him get another slice of baloney for free on the next turn.
That's drafting, and that's 7 wonders.
It hangs onto it's civilization building theme about as well as Dominion does - and that means, not very well. You never feel like your actually "building" something. You're just trying to get the right cards to maximize your points, and maybe denying cards to the person on your right or left, depending on which way the card draft is moving.
If you've ever played a game with drafting mechanics, it's probably due to this game, which is the best example of the mechanic, but, it's also the WORST example because it demonstrates how luck-centered drafting games are. It all depends on the draw of cards, and your luck of being on the receiving end of someone else's inattention. 
After all rounds are played, it may be difficult to tell who won, but's it's always easy to tell who LOST. Because when you lose, you usually lose big, and that would be okay if the game had some fun built into it. 
It doesn't.
And the process of determining the winner involves so many calculations and conditions. The game just ends, with a big deafening thud of Math hitting the table.
I know some people who really love this game, and have all the expansions. I get the "game" part of it, and it all functions and works very well, but it just isn't fun, at least, not for me.
It's more like an intellectual exercise pretending to be a game, that isn't very intellectually exact, due to the luck involved.
Those who are good at 7 Wonders, are very good, and they will win again and again, and want to play it again and again, while the rest of us have moved on to things like Ticket to Ride or Shadows over Camelot - games that are actually FUN.

Good game, played with 7. It can be fun but to do as an activity and all share in it. However, there is not really much interaction except with the people beside you until the end. One good point is that the length does not feel to drag, it ends at an appropriate time for the depth. Would play again and a preferred choice for lighter euro games.

Great game, has more plays over the past 5 years than any other game in my collection.  We always play with the Leaders and Cities expansion.  I highly recommend adding leaders as that makes the game much better.  If you have the money add cities as well, but if not it isn't a huge loss.

Surprised I've played this as much as I have, considering my poor opinion of it initially. I'm a big fan of Fairy Tale, and I've often felt that this was a bloated version of that. 

However, my opinion changed as I got to play it more. There is reason for the love. Drafting is fun. Always will be. The choices here can be tough. I don't love the military "cold war". And I don't love the need to collectively stop the player going for science. But the Wonder system is wonderful. I love how building your wonder gives you meaningful ways to trash a card an opponent may want. 

I will never own a copy. Everyone else does. But I'm happy to play it from time to time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A civilization themed game where you each round pick a card depicting a building which you either build, use for money or use to build you wonder. The rest of the cards are then passed to you neighbor.

What makes this game special is that it is a game that plays up to seven players in a short amount of time and yet feels more of a game than most of the fillers. Besides that, it is a polished and slick design. I am a little addicted to the drafting where you pass the card and the balance between making a good move for yourself and passing a great card to your opponent. The game is almost purely tactical, because even though you can have a plan on what you want to do in your game oftentimes the cards that are passed on dictates how well you are going to do. What you can do is to mitigate the risks.

7 Wonders always leaves me flat and I don't see how the game gets as high of a rating as it does here. No matter what strategy I pick (military, science, point cards, etc.), I never feel as if my strategy is "working". You never find out if you have won until the very end. The last time I played, the winner had 47 points while the worst player in a four player game had 40. You never feel as if you are separating yourself throughout the ages. Is that good balance? I guess, but it doesn't resonate for me. This game rarely hits the table, although it is a nice palate cleanser in between meatier gaming sessions.

Liked it less than I expected. Tying trade and war to seat position was clever, but aside from the military system I thought the theme was under served. I never felt like I was building a civilization -- I was just collecting color sets and trying to play the optimal card from the semi-random set received from my neighbor. It is a pleasant game and it does have a "just one more" quality but I wasn't especially disappointed when it went back in the box.

Played 10+ times with 7,6,5 &3 players. It is not doing much for me yet though I like that it plays in 30 mins and it handles up to 7. Playing Dominion would be my choice for 2-4 players but with 5-7 this could work with our group. Early raters seem to be giving this high marks, I worry this might soon feel samey with little depth to explore. While I gather more experience I will for now give it a 6. Jan 11

Okay, I have to confess, I now like this game. The first two times I played went poorly. It wasn't explained to me well, and I just didn't get it. Well, this has changed.

RATING: 7.5
This is the first game I bought when I started to get into board games. I have about 5 or 6 plays on the game from before I knew about BGG and the play tracking so I have played a bit more than it says.

I really like this game because the drafting mechanic is one I am familiar with from MTG, and I really liked the theme because I am a big fan of games like Civilization and Rise of Nations. I like how there are a bunch of different ways that you can win the game. Another feature I liked is that you can only interact with your two neighbors, so if you are in a game with 4 or more people you aren't able to directly effect some of the players in the game.

I want to get more play with this game and I am looking at expanding it in the future after I get some more play out of the base game.

I like civilisation building but don't have the time, or the geeks, to play Advanced Civilisation or 7Ages these days. 7 Wonders is nicely reductionist; some of the flavour of a good civ game (trading, developing technology, military considerations, building cities and wonders) but with 0% fat.  Negotiation, diplomacy and geo-political manoeuvring, are elements that I would not usually sacrifice, but then this is an aromatic light bite rather than a 6 hour banquet.

There is a good reason this is the top ranked family game. The best aspects of this game is that it is quick to set up and can be played in 30-40 minutes.  It is easy to learn but has enough strategy to make it interesting. And anyone can win.
I think it is best with 4 or more players.  With 3 players all resources are available to all players, some at a price of course.  
When my family received Settlers of Catan, we quickly bought all of the expansions and played very often.  This has now occurred with 7 Wonders as well as we play very often.
Virtually all of my Plays shown are using both Leaders and Cities as well as the extra boards.

Deck building meets civilization.  Plays quick with plenty of interaction.

Artwork is fantastic and once you learn the symbols, very functional.

Just a very good game as someone coming more fully into this hobby. My wife loves it, our families have really enjoyed it. It's quick to learn, fun to play, and once you understand the scoring everything is even better (takes one full game to really get it). I would recommend this game to anyone, especially because it introduces the card drafting mechanic in a clean and simple format, in a game setting most people can enjoy.

There isn't enough player interaction for me to get into it. I guess I just don't like games where the main interaction is denial of resources. I don't enjoy watching what other people are doing in their mostly separate game over on the other side of the table.

Update: It's growing on me a little bit. It's a game that almost everybody knows how to play at this point, it plays quickly, and there's plenty of depth. It fills a niche.

Though it's not the most amazing board game ever, 7 Wonders does have a few very key qualities that make it great: length, depth and number of players.  2-7 people can play a comfortably complex game in less than 45 minutes with little to no downtime for everyone involved since players all act simultaneously.  The civ building theme is completely pasted on though, so it's hard to feel like you're actually building something, not just making optimal card choices for points.

good game... for about the ten first games, after that you get bored since it's mostly the same thing over and over again. Images are nice too... I wouldn't buy the game, but it wouldn't bother me to play it once or twice a year. I prefer deep replayable games like agricola, Arkham Horror, Eldritch Horror, Tales of Arabian Nights, or card games better made like Seasons, magic the gathering, Testament of Duke de Crecy, etc. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
7 Wonders is both fast and light, but is facetted enough to open many avenues to follow on the path to victory. There is not a lot of deep strategy going on, since all the decisions have to be taken on the spot, and the different paths to victory remain rather intractable right up until the end. It is a very tactical game with a big element of luck ("the unexpected") involved. This game is repeatedly being faced with sets of options to choose from and trying to figure out which one will help bring together everything in the end.

I like the way the theme is implemented both in game art and in the rules. As far as the latter is concerned, I  specifically like that there are so many different paths to obtain victory points, and that some of the choices one can make later reconnect to other choices. Certainly, there are much more invovled civilisation bulding games that are much better in the simulation aspect, but none are as fast, as rich in choices and as colourful. This game has a very particular flair, which makes it very attrctive. 

I mostly play this with two or three players, because then the game acquires an additional strategic element, which adds quite a bit of depth. The only thing that would keep me from recommending 7 Wonders unreservedly is the fact that you don't get a lot of material for your money.

At first glance, it fits a lot into a tight time space.  At second, there isn't all that much to fit in.  Interaction is very limited, random factors are high, and something seems a little off about how the military system works.  Fine for the occasional filler, but not much more than that.

A very solid drafting game. Not extremely complicated, relatively easy to teach, and enough luck so that new players have a decent chance. However, doing for example statistical analysis on the cards, and remembering exactly what you pass and not can take the game to the next level, where it has a surprising amount of depth.

7 Wonders may not be as innovative as some have said, it matters not, there are few if any games as complex as it to be played with 7 players (even if it isn't a very complex game to begin with), and none as satisfying.

Really fun resource management card game. This is one of our go-to games for new players or when we can't decide what to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The game's simplicity belies the strategies and decisions that are present.  Players must make decisions as to which cards they seek to construct, realizing that by concentrating on a few categories they will likely be forced to neglect other categories, most likely to their detriment.  Further, this decision is influenced by the strategies being pursued by one's neighbors.  It is also wise to keep an eye on what resources your neighbors are producing -- and what they are not producing -- so you can plan accordingly.  

Choosing which card to keep can be tough, as there are usually multiple cards that are beneficial and fit your strategy.  Plus, the knowledge that you will be passing a desirable card or two to your neighbor is troubling.  Sometimes a card would be so valuable to your neighbor that you opt to keep it instead of a different card that you coveted more.  While these decisions are angst-inducing, their resolution is generally quick, so the game moves along at a brisk pace.

For me, the only knock against the game is that you can only significantly influence and be influenced by the players to your immediate right and left.  You have little real influence on the remaining players and, indeed, may not even be able to see what they are collecting.  Since you are not concerned with these other players, however, it does have the benefit of keeping the game moving along as there is little need to assess their holdings.  

This drawback, however, pales in comparison to the excitement and brilliance of the game.  There is a persistent tension of trying to collect the cards you desire.  Yes, much of this is dependent upon the cards you are passed, but everyone is forced to pass along valuable cards.  So, the odds are good you will be receiving cards that are beneficial.  It is fun and challenging to construct a set of cards that enable you to construct more valuable and beneficial cards as the game progresses.  It is not exactly an "engine building" game, but it has some of the elements.  

7 Wonders is an amazing design.  There aren't many games that can pack this much tension, decisions and strategy options in a 30 - 45 minute time frame, while accommodating up to seven players.  The game seems to have all the elements to give in great longevity in a hobby where most games fade to obscurity after just a few years.  It also has all of the elements that should make it a front-runner to capture industry awards such as the Spiel des Jahre and International Gamers Award.  Although this is a year wherein there have been numerous promising games published, 7 Wonders seems destined to rise to the top.

Enjoyable, relatively simple and fast game of card drafting - although not as simple and fast as "Fairy Tale", which has similar mechanics. It's very nice that it supports up to seven players without adding much playing time or chaos, since the actions are simultaneous and you only have to watch your immediate neighbors. However, it is a bit weird to have no interaction with other players beyond those two.  Also, it's extremely hard to assess how you are doing in relation to your opponents, given the convoluted scoring system. The decisions are very simple and I'm uncertain about "staying power".

Interesting quick game.  Not a mind blowing game, but at a quick play time and easy learning curve, it fits a niche.

I like that it plays up to 7 players, but the 'cards' that get played might get grouped to much in a 7 player game.

So, after a few more plays, it's still so-so.  Quick play, but I'm surprised how some people don't get the game explanations.

Also, I normally find the more the merrier in games.  This game I really think loses things after 5.  There's way too much 'bunching' of types of cards on 'sides' that may randomly occur to make it so one or tow people get completely screwed without any recourse.  (Not always, just some times).

A fantastic game which is well designed. usually played in 30 min. Easy to teach and easy to learn.
To me, it's more self-development rather than competence with each other. If you are the only person that wants to compete or set sb up, the target will have a hard day, but you will as well.
It'll be better to play online (prevent lie) or with a calculator (help better calculating score, which always takes around 10 min or so.)

Korábban valamiért nem tetszett, de most egyik kedvenccé nőtte ki magát. Mondhatom alapműnek is.
Tervezem beszerezni hozzá a Leaders kieget is (ami beszerzésre is került).
Igazi klasszikussá vált nálunk, nagyon jó benne, hogy társasokkal ismerkedőknek is könnyű bemutatni, játszani, azonban az idő múlásával a játék mélységei is jobban megmutatkoznak. Kevés a holtidő, mivel mindenki egyszerre gondolkodik, választ lapot és épít. A játékot jól ismerőkkel pedig minden gyorsan pörög és már lehet is a pontokon izgulni. Ha 50 pont felett vagy, akkor már esélyekkel indulsz az első helyért. A legtöbb, amit láttam, az 71 pont volt az alappal. :D

RATING: 6.5
Slightly interesting but a little bit disappointing in that it doesn't offer much strategy past the hand you are looking at. 

As a light game it has too many symbols to be inviting for casual players or non-gamers.  Even with a reference sheet the learning curve is a bit much for what the game offers. 

Players looking for something more strategic have been disappointed each time I've played this.

Not a bad game, but definitely underwhelming compared to how much this has been hyped up to me.

I waited a while before finally buying and trying this game. Waiting this long was a mistake. this turned out to be a lot of fun and a family favorite.

The deck drafting is innovative and it seems not one strategy is a sure win. I've won and lost games using the same strategy. Sure there is some luck and randomness in the card drafting but there is still a level of strategy and innovation to the game.

All I know is if someone is proposing to play this game, I never say no because I always have fun playing it. highly recommanded.

Plays fast, supports a wide variety of player counts, somewhat interesting decision structure.

Overplayed in my group, because of its support of large player counts.

7 Wonders became my favorite 'board' game soon after purchase.  The different strategies and approaches to victory are vast and can change easily based on the number you play with as well as whom you are adjacent to.  It seems like it will be complicated to learn, but most people fully understand it within the 2nd age of their first playthrough.

Mine. Regalo de los chicos de 2015 :D

Despues de dos partidas, debo decir que es un grandisimo juego. sencillez de reglas y a la vez multitud de alternativas. 

quiza tiene el defecto de que el factor suerte (como resulte el reparto de las cartas y lo que empiece a jugar cada jugador) puede condicionar rapidamente el desarrollo de la partida. en ese sentido hay que ser adaptable y buscar el balance entre conseguir resultados a corto y a largo plazo. 

le doy un hermoso 9 y liderazgo en el departamento de juegos de cartas no fillers. :)

RATING: 5
It is awesome that this will easily accommodate 6 or 7 players, but to be frank while I like it I prefer Fairy Tale. Other than the occasional glance at another player's tableau, I didn't feel like the drafting mattered much. What's left, then, is the card play itself, which is slightly more engaging but pretty simple and dry. There's also a serious problem in that most of your high-stakes decisions are made at the beginning of the game when you have no information.

It is a fine filler game, but lacks player interaction and depth / real decisions. More players mean less control, which makes it even more luck dependent.

Funny thing is, that most people call this a great game, as you can play it with up to 7 players, but actually, this is only half-true, because...

1) as I stated above, it gets more and more luck dependent, as you'll never see the cards again.

2) you won't have anything to do with the other players at all. 

It would be better to just play 2 different games, unless you like completely random games.

Joc de cartes amb mecanisme de draft, es tracta de buscar combinacions entre diferents tipus de cartes i fer el màxim de punts possibles. Incloú comerç (tot i que l'altre jugador no s'hi pot negar), interacció "militar" i asimetria entre els jugadors. Molt ràpid de jugar i escala molt bé de 3 a 7 jugadors (ja que realment només jugues amb els jugadors del teu costat).

Tot i que és un joc perfecte per iniciats, resulta complicat d'explicar. Temàtica molt enganxada.

Actualització després de més partides: tot i que el joc no funciona malamament del tot amb molts jugadors, es torna molt poc controlable, ja que de la "mà" que reps en cada torn, no te'n torna gairebé cap... El joc té sentit jugat a 3-4 jugadors.

RATING: 9
Pretend you're some sort of despot from...a couple of thousand years ago or so and trying to pimp out your main city to show who's the prettiest.  Well, that's a crude way of describing 7 Wonders.

Not entirely unlike Civilization (video game), as the unnamed ruler of a foreign kingdom, you have a plan to elevate your city to greatness, building civic structures, boosting your military might, investing in science and commerce whilst making sure you have the resources to construct a Wonder of the World.  Thing is, you're competing against a bunch of rivals with similar ideas.

The game is played simultaneously - everyone chooses a card, acts upon it and passes the hand on to the next player which means that everyone has a fairly balance chance of getting both favourable and unfavourable hands whilst screwing over rivals and being screwed by rivals.

This goes on over three eras where the resources needed to constuct buildings increases and competition gets fiercer and fiercer.  And then the scoring at the end of the game where one's decisions will either go with or against a player.  

Great game, quick learning curve, many different strategies to try, less competition factor and more focus on your own achievements.  And be sure to download the unofficial scoring app which lets you upload your scores to BGG!

Could be also rated 10. Great game with lots of depth and replayability, if all players understand drafting. Lots of unrecorded plays as well. (28.3.16) 

7 Wonders is still great. My favorite way to play is probably with just the base game, but I don't mind the expansions and they can definitely spice things up when played with experienced players. My favorite one is Cities which adds some variability without dictating strategy. Extra wonder boards are also nice. Leaders I dislike because it makes the game more swingy and really does not add that much. Best with 4 or 5, but still good with any number from 3-7. Takes the best part of MTG (drafting) and leaves out the boring part (playing out the games). (1.9.2017)

This makes it to the table quite often with several different groups of people, definitely a household favourite. Very popular among less-experienced players who want a game with a little more meat.

I'm reluctant to give 10 for any game, but 7 wonders is genuinely outstanding with only a few minor flaws that only become apparent after a lot of game play.

Works well as 2-7 player game, but it's always exciting when we get 7 players because we get to use the 7 player cards.

Delightfully complicated, takes probably 3 games to understand what you're doing.  Complex enough that it keeps your interest even when you play it regularly.

Quick to play: we've done a full game in 15 mins once when all players were focused.

Card choice is always tricky: you always want several of the cards.

The real magic of 7 Wonders is that despite the complex rules, with often many players at different abilities and ages, somehow the games are almost always very close.

One of the best new euros in some time.  Only complaints are odd sized cards (hard to sleeve) and don't play with any AP prone folks or you will sit around watching them look at cards.

Other than that, this is really a good one.  It plays fast, maybe half an hour, scales really well, has multiple paths to victory, and the different wonders along with card draw make every game different.  Military is balanced with science, is balanced with other strategies...  really a great euro and one of the best to come out in the last few years. 

Fun per minute and great scalability get this game to an eight.  If it was a 45 minute game that didn't scale, I'd rate a 7 or less.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
While ostensibly a game of card drafting, 7 Wonders is really much more about deciding where to commit resources. Each turn, a player selects a card, passes the rest of the hand, then plays the card. The card will either generate points towards winning in some way or else enable future cards to be played. This is the crux of the decision: resources for the future or points now. Since virtually every card does one (or both) of these things, it is far less important which particular card one takes. 

The scoring is reminiscent of Knizia, with some being interactive, some cards scoring multiple ways, etc. Like other games of this ilk, the complex scoring comes at a price as the last few minutes of the game will be spent doing addition to see who won. It plays very quickly and I could see playing this multiple times in a row. One of my favorite features is the wonder boards, which provide variable player powers, and nudge (but don't force) players in a certain strategic direction. It works well with almost any number of players because you are really only concerned with the players directly to your left and to your right. That said, with more players, the tactics of trying to "wheel" a certain card will not come into play.

There are a lot of euro-style mechanics neatly packed into this short game. It does have a very meaty feel considering it is essentially filler-length. The ability to accommodate so many players is a nice bonus as well. For its niche, I don't think any game has done this better, but for something deeper (or for thrills) you will have to look elsewhere.

RATING: 7.5
There are a lot of things that I like about this game.  It's easy to teach and fun for newbies, and yet it has lots of depth.  It doesn't have a turn order or "first player advantage" because all players choose an action and reveal them simultaneously.  It also can play up to 7 players with little change in playing time because you basically only interact with your immediate neighbours.

There seem to be many strategies to follow.  But it's important to realize that sets of sciences (green cards with different symbols) are worth 7 points each, so it's always good to go for breadth even if you're going for depth in a particular symbol.  Also, it's good to put up *some* sort of military card so that your neighbours don't win free points from you for free -- that is, without changing their play to prevent your military power from equalling or surpassing theirs.

Going for all blue (bonus points) isn't as good as it looks... need some diversity in green and red and even yellow to keep your options open.

I admit it handles 7 players without problem, and gameplay is really easy. I understand why it has so much popularity, specially with non gamers. But it is not very deep, and it is too light for a civilization game. Way too expensive now, and a pretty large box for only a deck of cards. May be in a few years we will get a copy.

In my opinion, this game is good but not great. This is largely based off the fact that I don't think that deck building and card-drafting alone make a game -- there needs to be something that follows.
-----------------------------------------------------------
Update: September 2014. 6 --> 5
This is OK but not good. For a game which could and should move at a brisk pace (since you are only making one decision per turn), there is still far too much information featured on each card for a game of this weight. Despite the game being a simultaneous action game, and also one with baked in strategies (which in turn means turns in which the 'obvious move' will appear directly after the first quick scan of the cards), the slowest player(s) set the pace. 
-----------------------------------------------------------
Update: July 2015. 5 --> 3
I can now say that I've actively avoided playing this game. There are so many other accessible card games that offer more meaningful decisions for their time frame.

Really liked it after 1 play in Essen. Think it needs a couple more plays before I buy it.
Having played it a few more times I wouldn't say no to a game but I don't really want it in my collection.
It's a great game for new gamers but it lacks interaction for me despite you being forced to interact with your neighbours, which is odd.

This got played into the ground when it first came out, but after a few years off, I once again see the appeal. Back up to a 6.

===

It's a reasonably fun card drafting game, but that dreaded "multiplayer solitaire" feel pervades. After a mere 6 plays, it's really starting to feel samey to me. A brisk tempo and short play time help a lot though, and keep it in the realm of quick opener or closer. Still, this one doesn't have the legs I'd hoped it would have, and eventually I see it settling around a 6 or even a 5. 

Note on the 2nd edition: Nooo! They took away what language was present and replaced it with incomprehensible icons! This thing already had too many icons, this just drags it down and makes it even more inaccessible. BAH!

I like to play this game, although it is a bit too random for my tastes. No matter how I plan my strategy it always fails miserably. 

Upsides:
 + Not too long
 + Even game even when playing with people with different experience
 + Very nice looking
 + Love the drafting mechnanic
 + Theme is complete inoffencive

Downsides
 - A bit too much luck
 - Can be a bit complex to explain for new players
 - Promises more strategy than can actually deliver.

INCREDIBLE GAME! You would think that a simple civ building card game would not warrant a 10 score but this is not just a SIMPLE CIV game- this is a gaming achievement! Gameplay is challenging but never too difficult to understand, the artwork is outstanding, and the components are top notch! A no-brainer, perfect 10!

The theme seems really quite interesting and right up my street. However, the game itself is overly long for what it is and extremely dull. Card drafting is not one of my favourite mechanics and for a long time this game was single-handedly responsible for putting me off the mechanic entirely. "Oh, your game has card drafting? Then I think I'll pass!".

More recently I have encountered much more interesting games that use card drafting and so have decided that it isn't just the mechanic that puts me off 7 wonders... it's just a boring game. I've played it quite a few times now but don't think I will again.

My family and I really enjoy this game.  Be warned, though:  it may take a few games before you can fully appreciate the strategy involved.  This was a situation where my wife and son seemed to pick up on the fun of the game after the first play, but it took me about 4 or 5 games before it started to click.  That would most likely explain why I didn’t win my first game of this until our 8th play or so.

Winner or not, I discovered how to play the game and started enjoying it more and more.  We have only played it with 3 players, so as much as we enjoy it with us 3, I can only imagine it being that much more enjoyable playing it with more (I am almost afraid to, since I think it may cause our 3 player games to go from fun to somewhat boring, if that makes sense).

The one downside is that even though it is called “7 Wonders”, it would have been nice to have a larger selection of wonders to have a little more variety.

In any case, once I figured out how to *really* play the game, this became a top-5 game for me.  Technically, I should say this became a top-5 game with the addition of the Leaders expansion.

Solid game- probably a good gateway but I think it gets far too much dap from serious gamers. I like drafting, but the group make-up can really determine how the game plays

In that respect, it's a game that is frustratingly hard to win against groups of new players unless you take science as a strategy, which is stupid against any group of experienced players

This a great light Civ game that plays quick and has tough choices on each turn. A bit of luck helps, but doesn't make the game any less fun. You need to plan ahead for later rounds and also keep on eye on what your neighbours are doing to be successful. A lot of fun in 30-45 minutes.

[Initial Impression: 7]

Fast-playing resource management game that has a simple primary mechanic, but also multiple routes for earning VPs. This makes it pretty intuitive and quick to explain, but also gives it a relatively deep feeling for such a quick-playing game. There is a lot to juggle and the combination of starting boards will provide a different feel, so clearly there is a lot to learn and plenty of room for strategic variance across many games. Doesn't immediately leave me feeling like I'd want to play it over and over like I do with Race for the Galaxy or Dominion, but scratches a similar itch, and reminds me a bit of Stone Age in a way. Definitely interested in trying it again.

RATING: 7
After 2 plays: The game is good, but I don't see many paths to victory. The earlier blue cards seem very weak and even the later blue ones aren't that helpful. Looks like the best strategy is to build up your resource engine and military in the first half and grab the greens and purples in the second half.

I really like this game.  It plays very well with 3-5 (all I've played so far.)

There are a few minor iconography tweaks I would make.  Specifically keeping the Coins and VP symbols in the same place for the small icons in the upper center of the Yellow Cards.

Looks like this will hit the table often as it plays quickly and has some legit decisions to be made during play.  Passing your hand of cards after each play keeps you up on what your opponents are doing as you don't want to pass them a great building they may be able to build for free.

It is a common game in the BoardGame Club we play it frequently. It consumes literally wide number of players, but it isn't enough good to buy it to my personal collection. I feel the interaction between the players not enough to satisfy me. I mean, this is a great game, but it is enough to play it once or twice a month.

Pros / Cons:
-Great variety, rare to see the two very similar games.
-Easy to teach rules, clear simbols on the cards.

-Lack of interaction between players.
-It can become boring after a few games.

Nice blend of strategies here, and especially in a game with more than 3, forces you to keep an eye on your neighbors and try to adjust your play accordingly.  Gives you a lot to think about without too complex of rules, and with the card drafting mechanic, ensures that you can try to deny other people or at least have chances at the same cards.

A bit on the random side that can be too hard to mitigate, and it can be completely futile if the person who wins sits next to somebody new or not paying attention much.  I guess that part of it pushes me more to a game that is solitaire-esque with a lesser amount of interaction.

7 Wonders is Draft & Go, ultra-accelerated, but so nicely balanced in the cards that there is strategy, apparently several strategies, and games can be quite close.

Bauza has done it again; while drafting has never been my favorite mechanic, he turned drafting into an art, creating a flexible, quick-playing civ-lite game which retains strategy without downtime.

This is just another terrific game- wow!

Solid drafting game.  I feel like it's a bit overrated by the general public though.  Most of the games I've played feel very much the same when I've played them.

PL: Grałem w tą grę zaledwie kilka razy, ale można powiedzieć, że jestem jej wielkim fanem. W jej wypadku działa zasada: im więcej osób, tym więcej zabawy. Gra we dwie i trzy osoby nie ma sensu. Prawdziwa rozgrywka zaczyna się dopiero od czterech graczy. Gra jest ładnie wykonana, ale bez większego szału - po prostu zwykłe karty i kartonowe żetony. Największym plusem tej gry jest możliwość obrania strategii zwycięstwa w zależności od losowanych kart, albo posiadanego cudu. Praktycznie do samego kończ rozgrywki nie wiesz, kto ma przewagę i kto zostanie zwycięzcą. Gorąco polecam na posiadówki z większą ilością osób.

EN: I played this game just a few times, but I can say that I am a big fan of it. In it's case the principle "more people, more fun" is working. Playing with two or three people doesn't make sense. The real game begins with four players. The game is nicely done, but without much distraction - simple cards and cardboard chips. The greatest advantage of 7 wonders is the opportunity to pursue a strategy of victory, depending on your cards, or a miracle, that you are building. To the end of the game it is hard to say who has an advantage, and who will be the winner. Highly recommended for plays with more people.

May give it a different rating after more plays. This game is a lot of fun, so far, and is fairly light weight. It takes a little longer to explain to new players than the reviews would have you believe, but it still doesn't take a ton of time. I expect the play experience and strategies to be unique based on the number of players. Randomness and luck are factors, but it's not too much of either.

Still not convinced that this game is as strategic as it appears, but that it is mostly choosing a strategy based on your wonder ability (if any) and playing your best card available each turn.  Still, it is a FUN game, quick and can accommodate up to 7 players.  Update:  There is definitely some strategy in choosing your victory path, then trying to deny your neighbors the cards they need.  I updated my rating to a 9.  Later downgraded to an 8.  After several more plays, I am convinced that "strategy" is almost non-existent and am downgrading my rating to a 6.

A clever game that takes drafting cards to another level. Each round of the game, a draft of cards is passed around which contain improvements you can build for your civilisation - if you have the appropriate resources or can buy them from your neighbours. Each improvement scores you points, sets of developments score you points and in the end, you need ot have the most points. A fun, light game, but in the end not so wonderful that I need to own it.

RATING: 6
An interesting twist on "Screw your neighbor" or "Pass the Trash" poker games. You have seven cards, and after choosing one to play, you must pass the rest to your neighbor to your left (or right depending on the age). The only problem is that ALL of the cards are something you want! The problem is which one will maximize your production or points, while limiting the benefit(s) to your neighbor.

The mechanism is so absurdly simple, making for an extremely light game, or so I thought. There are agonizing decisions to be made with every card. Further, the cards you set up early in Age I will affect your ability to score points in Age III; there's plenty to lament on what you should have done or not!

My only quibble at first is that this game requires some memorization of the available cards in order to do well, similar to Glory to Rome. However, the learning curve is not as severe, as there is very little to read in terms of text on each card; the symbology is straight-forward and easier than Race for the Galaxy.

The game shines in the fact that it can scale up to seven, with no appreciable or proportional increase in downtime, finishing in 30-45 minutes. Card selection and play is simultaneous, so downtime is the relatively same whether there are two or seven people playing (well, there may be more of a chance of an AP-induced straggler with larger groups). Initial rating: '8'.

Update (10/02/11) 10+ plays: This game has definitely peaked. It's still not bad as a quick filler, but people are starting to grumble about the stale nature of the game--people have figured it out. Will an expansion help? I'm beginning to not care too much to get one. Also, teaching non-gamers may be a bit too much for their first game, so this is not as good a gateway game as I thought. I'm dropping this down from an '8' to a '7'.

Update (12/15/11) 19+ plays: I introduced this to my gaming club at work at the annual Xmas party to great success--everybody loved it. A hint to teaching larger groups: teach no more than 3 newbies at first, and then have them teach the next three newbies for a 7-player game (which is what happened). The drafting mechanic and card choices will require a lot of hand-holding for the first Age; having three "veterans" (each with one game under their belt) definitely helps to guide the new-newbies. 

I've concluded that the 7-player is totally chaotic: there just seems very little one can do to "steer" their destiny. It is also somewhat dependent on the left and right player/neighbor binding. Players that are new or inexperienced may not necessarily build optimally (for them), and indirectly may affect what I can build. There seems to be a coupling of what I can build relative to what resources my neighbors are building. If they don't build up, I spend actions building up resources and forgoing juicy victory point buildings. I can't quite articulate it, but something about the player binding really bothers me. I will need to play a number of times more to figure it out.

* * *

After reading the comments of users who rated this a '4' or below, I am beginning to understand the negativity. 7-player is a total crap shoot since you will never see the cards you've passed over. It is a much harder game to grasp for newbies, since they will not know or appreciate the interactions of the cards or the combos that are available.  It probably is a better game at 4-player, since some of the cards will cycle back to you, providing some strategic options, rather than solely tactical ones. The game has a rather short half-life. Still, it was a breath of fresh air when it came out, and one has to give it kudos for the amount of excitement it generated for it's ground-breaking design; it was a candle that burned brightly and quickly at both ends, and now it's time to move on....

Update (05/27/12) 34 plays: If there are 5-7 players, I will grudgingly play, if we are still waiting for more players to arrive. The game is no more than a social vehicle. I don't care anymore if I win or lose, because of the various issues raised earlier, as it just seems pointless to try. Dropping to a '6'.

Update (01/02/2015) 41 plays: Yes, it is fun to play once in awhile and agonize about the cards you want to play. Then, the randomness and chaotic nature of the game starts to seep in, and I see it for what it is. It is a great game in terms of game design, making it a good introduction away from the lighter gateways. However, for gamers looking for meatier play, it soon becomes like a meaningless exercise in futility. It is still a "6".

Though rife with shocking nudity and Masonic devilry, the game functions well enough for what it is, a "super-filler" that hosts up to seven players in 30 minutes.  It's pretty, engaging, and the small decisions are nice.  At the end you're rewarded with an awesome/mediocre/just-plain-sad tableau that tells the story of your soaring/forgotten/broke-ass civilization.

[i]But...[/i]

The game suffers grotesquely when players don't counter-pick—the player who manages to seat themselves between two milquetoasts will win with a shockingly massive score.  We're talkin' 37-42-52-[b]87[/b]-33 shocking. 

"What the hell were you doing?!" I ask Ms. 87's neighbors.

They blink as if slapped.  "I was building my civilization," they say.

"For the love of God," I rave, "Why did you keep passing her [i]exactly what she needed?![/i]"

"Well," they mumble, "I had other things to do."

"Yes," I gurgle through clenched teeth, "Like making sure she doesn't double all our scores!"

So, yeah, this game requires mouth-pooping in order to work.  When everyone keeps a scatalogical eye on their neighbors—and even up- and downstream some—it's a nice little card drafting game that's over quickly enough that you don't notice the undigested corn.

When playing with people who refuse to poop in their neighbor's mouths, I [i]strongly suggest[/i] you sit between two of them in order to maximize your score.

[b]After 25 plays:[/b]  Much better (I'd rate it an 8) with the [gameid=92539] expansion.  Leaders allow you to focus your strategy (just a little), or at least build some synergy.  Or, with a poor selection, have hilariously random historical figures running your show.  [i]Hatshepsut in Rome?![/i]  ~LULZ

Expansions owned:

[thing=92539]Leaders[/thing]
[thing=111661]Cities[/thing]

[thing=154638]Babel[/thing]

[thing=133993]Wonder Pack[/thing]

All beautifully ensconced in a Broken Token insert!

Pretty fun. It can be difficult to teach to parents and grandparents. Kids, on the other hand, seem to pick up the rules and iconography really quickly. I like how quick and smoothly the game can go with people who know what they are doing. One flaw I've noticed is that it's easy to get comfortable doing the same strategies every game which makes replayability a bit limited.

RATING: 7
Nice drafting game.  My main complaint is that it is fairly easy to make mistakes and almost impossible to tell when your opponents have done so due to the simultaneous nature of the game.  I very often wonder how a person could have managed to buy so many expensive buildings with so few resources.  Having said that the simultaneous gameplay has allowed the very difficult feat of producing a seven player game with almost no downtime.

I got Sushi Party Go because it was similar to this (which I don't own, but have ready access to) but 7 Wonders is deeper and the added complexity adds a lot more interest for not a lot more hassle.

This is one of the best within it's genre.  Solid play, very fast paced and easy to pick up and easy to learn.  It has a set number of rounds and plays a decent number of players.

I don't know why people rave about this game so much.  They created a new categorization for the Speil des Jahres and this game won but I don't know how much this is due to the new category.

The entire game is about drafting cards, there is only so much you can do in a larger game.  With players of vastly different skill levels you can find people getting advantages that you could never alter no matter how hard you try.

If played in the context of experienced gamers who have played this game at least 3 times previously, and all players are similarly astute about drafting to block or maximize advantage then I would probably rate the game higher.  But for the environment where no one game gets to be played dominantly for two months, then 7 wonders is difficult to play well but easy to play randomly.  In some cases people win and don't realize how or why.

My personal variant is that I want to outscore the people to my left and right, the absolute highest score doesn't matter to me.  I also like to look at the delta between the players to my left and right, if I beat both those players by a decent margin and they have similar scores I consider that better than a higher overall point spread over both players if those players have vastly different scores.  Something like the product of the two deltas, compared to other players product of the two deltas.

The game can be played quickly, and I suggest allowing less time for each draft as things progress - keep it moving quickly.  Some people in my group grind over what to do and have 2 or even 3 drafts backlogged waiting for them.

I really dig this game, top 5 party game imho. I like how smooth the game flows(base game, not much experience with exp.), learned how to play in a fairly quick, and taught a friend how to play in about ten.  After reading the quick-sheet, the icons were intuitive thereafter. The two player option is not terrible, but no where near the experience of a real third player (and plus). a 7 player game got a little tough with resources, but still went quick.

I found this to be surprisingly enjoyable. It's not great as a two-player - you essentially take turns playing a 3rd, dummy player, but it's fun in a large group. One nitpick is that, since you only ever interact with your direct neighbors, with a group > 4 there will be people whose outcome in the game you have almost no control over. Not much strategy in that, really.

It's an okay game.  It just feels like it is missing something.  It's kinda sorta really straight forward.  The decisions don't feel difficult enough for me.  Or maybe a better way to phrase it is, the decisions don't cause enough tension for me.  It feels like the complexity is added for the sake of making it more complex.  I rather play fairytale.

Overall a good game. It plays quick and there's multiple paths to victory which I'm a big fan of. We played about four games, and I felt like, at least with the group I was playing with, that I had come close to cracking the game. I expect that if I were to play with some experts that I would get the floor wiped with me. But I feel like with a couple more plays I could memorize how much of each resource is available in a round and build up off of that. 

Don't get me wrong, it's a great game and I had a lot of fun and the time to play hits what I would call a "filler game." It's quick (30 min or so) and all around good.

I love the fact it plays up to 7 players. There is definitely a learning curve to this game due to all the symbols. One bad thing I would have to say is that, I wish the point system was given on how the scientific symbols scored on the back of the rule book or on some reference card. The points you get from the scientific symbols are on a random page in the book I have to sift through. It's difficult to remember because it scores 1, 4, 9 points for duplicate symbols rather than a pattern like 3, 6, 9.

Unlike many games (such as Dominion), in 7 Wonders you are forced to adapt your entire strategy depending on what cards you get—which I like because it makes the game less repetitive.  However, it ends up being a mathy point salad, which I don't like as much.

I’ve heard 7 Wonders called a good gateway game, and I really don’t think it is; but what I think it is is a good gateway engine-building game. [thing=143884]Machi Koro[/thing] is a good gateway game, but not a good engine-building game. The ‘engine’ there is another way of saying putting all your eggs in one basket, and that’s effective in Machi Koro, but it’s not engine-building.

But in 7 Wonders, you’ve got not only engine-building, but also logistics: You want to build your engine, but you’ve also got to plan ahead for your wonder; you need to build the things that will let you build your engine. Aim 7 Wonders at a group of new gamers and watch them scatter, but wait until they’ve learned [thing=13]Settlers[/thing], [thing=41090]Magnate[/thing], and [thing=25554]Notre Dame[/thing], and 7 Wonders will be the next best thing: real engine-building, a step into [thing=28143]Race for the Galaxy[/thing] and [thing=35677]Le Havre[/thing] and [thing=19857]Glory to Rome[/thing] and [thing=31260]Agricola[/thing].

The grudge I have against 7 Wonders is that I like it less than Magnate [i]and[/i] less than Le Havre. Le Havre pays off its complexity debt; Magnate has a debt more suited to its gameplay. 7 Wonders is just a little more complex than it needs to be, and it has a little bit of a Feldian feel to it: There’s a lot to keep track of, but not as much actually going on. Subsystems feel like little scoring minigames related to each other only in that when you choose to play one minigame you can’t play another.

I like 7 Wonders, and I look forward to playing it as a family, but I look forward to playing other games even more. It’s not a game to discard after we’ve moved on to better games, but it isn’t one of those better games, either.[color=#ffffff]a9Z4MnAx[/color]

One of my favorite games of all time. It plays every player count well(2 players is "interesting"), it's easy to teach and plays in a very short time. There is a good amount of game in the base, but I feel the expansions greatly helped in making varying strategies and increasing the game's replayability without adding too much complexity. Personally, my favorite is Leaders, since it adds the most to the game and will refresh the experience to those who may be burned out on base 7 Wonders, followed by Babel and then Cities. 

I think if no more content was made for 7 Wonders, I'd be completely happy at this point. The game has provided many hours of fun and enjoyment with many different people of experience.

Pros: Can handle 7 players in ~30-ish minutes. (Though most card drafting games do)

That being said, I don't look at it as a go-to intro to card drafting--because since 2010 there are more card drafting games that are more accessible (ie: less different icons). It's okay if you want to play with 7 people, but can't bear to break up into two groups, so you can play this game where you only pay attention to what your two neighbors are essentially doing instead? Which might be why it's been voted as "best with 4". But at that point, you could just play something else...?

Great game, but the base game is very tactical in a lot of cases with little room for planning ahead, which gets worse as you add players. Not a huge complaint, but it is more fun to see a plan come to fruition. I'm curious to try it with the leaders expansion.

Dropped off quite a bit after playing much more. It's still fun but like Dominion, if the other players aren't into it the game drags a bit and becomes very mechanical.

This game fills a space that not many games occupy. It's short, but doesn't feel like a filler. It scales really well, but more players don't necessarily add more playtime. Very enjoyable and the theme is strong enough to help the mechanics make sense.

RATING: 6
A simple card drafting and 'engine' game build around some fairly bland cards. There are plenty of different directions in which to diversify, but the Science cards represent such a powerful scoring multiplier that unless several players collect them, then the lucky recipient will probably be the winner. The game really needs the players to be self-balancing here, otherwise anyone who keeps being passed those lovely green cards is a shoo-in to win. The problem with all games of this type is that no-one knows the future, so putting down any card is a gamble as to whether you'll be able to build on it further. The same charge could be levelled against Race for the Galaxy, but the formula works better there because end of game cards are in the deck from the start and so give you a clear target to aim at. This is light, unchallenging fun, but nothing to go overboard about.

[b]IF ALL THE CIVILIZATIONS DEPICTED IN THE GAME HAD BUILT THEIR EMPIRES AND LEFT THEIR MARKINGS ON THE HISTORY BOOKS THE SAME WAY THIS GAME UNFOLDS, I HARDLY BELIEVE THEY WOULD BE ONF ANY RELEVANCE TODAY[/b]

It is not usual for me to come across games I don’t like, for one reason or the other. If those games are about civilization building and historical elements, the probabilities of it not making the cut are astronomical. But then again, if it wasn’t for games like this, I wouldn’t like my historical and building games so much.

7 Wonders, despite the unjustified fuzz about it, is not a great game. In fact, I dare say it’s not even a good one at all. The whole drafting mechanics supporting it are clearly broken and tend to turn the game into an all-out mess on the table when experienced players play with beginners. But in the spirit of fairness, I must say that my experience with this may not be the best base for an objective verdict, especially because I learned to play it with another 6 guys at the table, with a friend of all of us explaining the game. From the get go, the game is clearly the most boring and chaotic experience ever when played with more than five players, maybe even more then four. However, that’s the closest I’ve been to actually playing the game, so writing about it from that perspective is the best one I have. Sadly, I don’t think I will ever play 7 Wonders again. *Sigh*

The draft mechanics are interesting and it was pretty simple for me to understand them since I am a rehabilitated Magic: The Gathering player. The only problem with this is that most of your game depends on the luck of the draw factor that comes with this type of games. If you need a certain card, there’s actually no real certainty that you’ll get it, because after drafting a card in each turn, players get to see what the others choose, so blocking choices for the other players, king-making decisions or radical changes in one’s own strategy (Which for me makes the game nothing but a “win some, lose most” ordeal) forced by not getting certain cards are way too common and frequent in a game that plays almost unnecessarily fast. There’s no actual strategy behind this game, only feeble tactics and very weak decisions.

Maybe with a lot less players, with some time to read the rules quietly and at least a few minutes to make a good, conscience decision on which card to choose and how to use it would make the game a lot more interesting and complex, but for now, I’m keeping away from that game. Too bad, especially because the arts and graphics are gorgeous and the whole them stroke my History buff nerve.

[b][i]II. Sliders[/i][/b]

Abstract [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Themed: A Civilization building game based on the 7 Wonders of the Ancient World is definitely my kind of game and despite the fact that the cards in the game are useful for any player and civilization, the idea of all of those cards being so simple and basic are perfect for a game where the players vie for the best Wonder for their people, especially because most civilizations started pretty much in the same way.

Simple [b]___[COLOR=#FF0000][4][/COLOR]______[/b] Complex: When playing with faster players, more experienced ones or whatever, taking your time for each decision is impossible, so you tend to look for the “best” card you have at that moment, without considering if the card itself might help you with other projects or endeavors within your own personal board.

Strategic [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Tactical: Card-drafting games this quick and unstable are almost impossible to be thought of as “strategic”, since most of the decisions you have are limited by the hands you get from the other players and the previous cards you got on your board. Certainly, some long-term building or collecting could work just fine, but those possibilities are way to constricted by the low chances of getting the exact cards you need or want.

Luck [b]_[COLOR=#FF0000][2][/COLOR]________[/b] Skill: Skill on 7 Wonders is shown not in the cards you choose every time a new set is handed out, but how well you end up using them as a whole in the end. Meanwhile, the luck of the draw factor plays the most central role in this game, with the exception of the draw consists on a set of cards of which one must be chosen, the rest possibly handed out to be permanently lost. There is only an illusion of control in this game.

Fiddly [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] Elegant: Something worth mentioning is definitively the elegance of the rulebook and the rule set. The game plays smoothly and it’s almost never a necessity to have the rulebook close by to consult on this or that special rule. The very simple mechanics are very well exploited, and the rest depends on the player’s decisions.

Indirect interaction [b]______[COLOR=#FF0000][7][/COLOR]___[/b] Direct interaction: The military cards in the game are nice and it puts into the game the aggressive competitive element needed in all true civilization building games, which is the armed power. Some cards are better, some cards are cheaper, but it’s always fun to see the reaction on the other players when armies are way too big to be stopped. However, the idea of only being able to attack the players right next to you, makes the whole army side of the game a bit lame and boring, and way too limited in certain occasions. Also, the idea of needing sometimes the resources of your neighboring players is interesting and very adequate, but it happened pretty much the same as what goes on with the army cards.

Cutthroat [b]_______[COLOR=#FF0000][8][/COLOR]__[/b] Friendly: Playing to win, to be the best builder, to be the strongest general, to block other players decisions or just to collect certain cards or colors or whatever the players want at the time is possible, and I suppose it’s fun enough. Decisions in the game are the basis for everything, so playing like a dick just to annoy other players or playing on one’s own terms is just as good.

Heavy use of language [b]________[COLOR=#FF0000][9][/COLOR]_[/b] No language needed: The game is almost in all senses text-free and as mentioned above the elegance of it makes it almost completely unnecessary to reach for the rulebook every time a doubt shows up. Symbols and combinations of symbols are easier to understand and make the game somewhat faster and lighter.

RATING: 8
Is a good large-group game, with multiple paths to victory. Fast paced and generally fixed duration, once people are familiar with the game play mechanic.

Can have a bit of a learning curve for first time players, as the third age cards are generally dependent on what resources / path to victory a player is taking. But, first time players can generally get decent scores muddling through.

RATING: 7
High-quality filler with some depth to it and plenty of replayability.  This is a quick card-drafting game made engaging by fear of one's neighbors, greed for the best cards, and a certain amount of calculated risk.  Somehow I ended up playing this over and over again, without ever really intending to--that's the sort of game this is. (Seventeen already? Sheesh.)

The problem I have with the game is that it has almost no interaction. It seems like people only focus on what they r doing instead of looking at what people r doing (although you should). Then it's not easy to estimate how well you are doing compare to the others until the final calculation at the end of the game. I think the game is very strategic but it's no fun at all.

I get that this is broadly considered a modern masterpiece, and I can see why. Drafting is a fun mechanic. There are lots of strategic avenues in 7W that play out across rounds, so over the course of the game you can build a decent shot at victory even if your first round feels like you got stuck with stuff you didn't necessarily want. The short playtime means you can get some genuine strategic depth out of 15 or 20 minutes.

Here's the thing, though: I don't love it. I've found 7W consistently difficult to teach to new players - not because of mechanical weight or because the rules are extensive, but because the iconography and the way strategies develop over rounds is complex and intimidating. That gets better over the first few rounds, but I have tried 7W on a few different groups now, and every time it's a lead balloon. People are so confused initially that even though they're finally "getting it" by the time the first game ends, there's no desire left to try again.

[b]Sushi Go![/b], meanwhile, hits most of the same notes in a much cleaner, faster, more accessible way (and is also infinitely less irritating to score). And [b]Among the Stars[/b] gives me the mechanic, with more strategic depth but without the iconography or endgame scoring math homework, plus the added visual splash of the space stations being built and what is (to me, anyway) a more fun theme. Sorry, 7W. I guess you're just not for me.

This is a little too complex for family gaming, and I'm not sure the complexity is actually justified for the depth of the decisions you need to make (e.g. does the tech tree really add anything to the game?).

Being able to affect only your immediate neighbour (to a first approximation) works around many problems inherent in this sort of game, but (if you'll excuse the tautology) means you have very little influence over most other players.

For a quick, light game it's OK, and going up to 7 players while remaining quick is nice.

We really love this game.
The first time you play it, it seems a little bit complicated. But once you learn how to play, you get so fast at it that you wish it were a longer game. It's not something I'd recommend if you want hard core gaming, but you can set it up quick and start having fun when you don't have hours available to dedicate to a game. Most games last only about half an hour, so if your looking for a game that doesn't have a lot of down time and is quick to set up and play, I would recommend this game.

A double-edged sword, this game is.  On the one hand, it can be hard to maintain a strategy throughout an entire game due since you are basically at the mercy of the cards.  On the other hand, there aren't many other games out there that have as many avenues to victory, can support so many players, and play as quickly as 7 Wonders.  It's easy to get burned out on this game since it's played so often (due to the aforementioned quick play time and flexible player count), but I don't think I'd ever turn down a game.  What the hell, it's only 30 minutes right?

I enjoy 7 Wonders well enough to play it, but not quite enough to own it (especially seeing as everybody else in the world owns the game, it feels like). I vastly prefer it with 3 or 4 over any other number. I don't tend to like dummy players (as with the 2-player game) or not seeing much of the same "pack" ever again (as with the 5+ player game).

Sometimes I sort of wish I still had 7 Wonders, but then I get over it. Maybe if an expansion comes along that really kicks it up a notch for me, I'll rebuy it. Leaders definitely isn't it.

--Jan 22, 2013--

I occasionally play 7 Wonders. Every time I do, I like it a little less. I will now play it every few months, but never twice in a row. I do not believe any expansion will get me to rebuy 7 Wonders. Funny-- I don't usually take a game from a 9 (which I think 7 Wonders started at) down to a 4 (current rating). Ouch!

RATING: 7
Quite fun. Hard to impose and stick to a strategy though, and who wins often feels a bit random, and at the mercy of the players directly next to them paying attention and sacrificing what they are doing to prevent it. 

Like: It's possible to win in a variety of ways. Card drafting as a mechanic is fairly interesting. 

Dislike: Every game plays out fairly similarly. Reliance on other players to pay attention beyond what they themselves are doing. Some players take way too long to make simple card selection decisions.

First played at Ludo-Outaouais in November 2011.  I wish we'd had time to play more than once, as we didn't realize the importance of some types of resources until the third Age.

Anyway, I like the mechanics of this game, and especially like that everyone plays simultaneously.  We played with 4, but playing with 7 wouldn't add much to the length of the game, nor would there be much downtime for players.  I think that's the best feature of this game.  Everything else (various ways to obtain victory points, theme, etc) are all a distant second.  It's an OK game... not my favourite, but it fills the need for a quick non-party game for large groups.

Nice, fast game, especially for many players, since the time hardly goes up at all with number of players. You mainly care about your two immediate neighbors, and everybody decide on a move at the same time. The major weakness is the chains of cards paying for each other. Those chains are hard to plan for and easy to miss, which may slow he game down. That is a bad thing for a game where the fast gameplay is a major feature.

I have mixed feelings about this. I really like the theme and ideas, but after playing Sushi Go! I now can't shake feeling that it's just overcomplicated for what it is. 

Having said that, I think my main problem is that everyone I've played it with hasn't liked it and so I never been able to progress beyond a basic learning game. That makes Sushi Go the better option as less effort to get it going.

I think there may be extra nuances to this game that would emerge with greater exploration. I keep it in the hope I find someone enthusiastic enough to give it a few decent plays, so I can evaluate properly.

RATING: 8
A game that takes seven players and plays in ~30 minutes?  With civ-building?  Sign me up!

One disadvantage: Relies very heavily on card-drafting.  If one or more players is weak at card-drafting, it'll unbalance the game.  You need to ensure that all players are equally matched, or keep an eye on everything that's going on at the table and kibitz a little when you see a player's tableau getting out of control.

This a very beautiful game to look at.  The cards are a wonderful bit of design and the game mechanics are elegant and varied.  So, why don't I rate this higher?  I think the first 20 times I played it, I enjoyed the game.  But, after that, it starts to wear itself out.  It's a game that's very lightweight.  There are games that actually explore aspects of ancient civilizations and are a bit of a learning experience.  This game does none of that.  To some extent, it's empty calories.

RATING: 7
Very entertaining draft/deck-based game, with an interesting them, good artwork, and balanced mechanics from 3 to 7 players. The game is a bit slower at 6-7 players, and definitely works best with 4 players. The icons and symbols are a bit hard to grasp at the beginning, and there are a few rules that you will definitely overlook in the first few games, but this game is definitely more entertaining than Dominion, and more open to non-hardcore gamers.

7 Wonders is a great game!  The setup relatively quick, games take roughly 30 minutes, and a great deal happens in a short period of time.  While there are quite a few symbols for a new player to learn, 1 or 2 plays through will get you up to speed.  There are many different strategies that you can employ and the game can vary quite a bit depending on the cards you are dealt and the actions of your neighbors.  The cherry on top is that it works with 3 - 7 players and still feels balanced.  I have not tried 2 player.  After playing it more than 20 times I may not suggest it as a first pick, but I am almost never disappointed with it.

Simple card-drafter that can accommodate up to 7 players. Unfortunately, players only interact with their immediate neighbours (the player to their left and right), and even those interactions are largely passive-aggressive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great looking fast game, where 3 seems the sweet spot and 2 an interesting option. Gets much better with the B side of the wonders.

After many plays I've decided to modify my initial rating. Now, I believe that the game should get 6 for 4-7 players (5 for the gameplay +1 for being something that is not a party game but can still acommodate up to 7 players), 7 for 3 players and an absolute 8 for the 2-player experience (especially with the B side). With the 2-player officila variant, the game comes through as quite deep and involved,retaining its speed and grace. I highly recommend it.

Oh, one more thing. 7 Wonders is one of the most beautiful games I have (+1 rating), being at the same time surprisingly expensive (especially when you think about the quality of cards)and put in an obviously too big box (-1 rating).

Overally: still a solid 8!

Liked this a lot.  Core mechanic is card drafting (i.e., pick a card to play from your hand, then pass the hand to the next player).

Game appeared to be immediately in the comfort zone of folks who have played card-collecting game draft event; however, it did not take long to pick up for those of us without that background.

Some similarities to Race for the Galaxy in that you are trying to build up your civilization's resources and accomplishments in a fashion such that your cards actually complement each other.

Another big plus is that the game plays quickly.

Only a few plays in.  And only 2-players with "Bob".

Still, it's a darn good game.  It does almost everything right.  It's interesting, with out that much rules overhead.  I could really see pulling this one out with the quasi-gaming family.

It's not going to take the place of RftG, but that's not the target audience.

There are enough interesting decisions and strategic paths I would keep coming back for more.

And it's pretty to boot.

One of the only games in existence (that is worth its salt) that engages 7 players and plays fast as lightning. Can get a bit sick of it for this reason, but this is to take nothing away from being what all draft games aspire to.

7 Wonders is a miraculous game in civilization. Unlike other civilization building games, 7 Wonders has simple rules. Above all, this game has considerablly shortened the playing time. Unbelievably, as a civilization game, 7 Wonders takes only less than 30 minutes. Although the  playing is short, players still can experience the original civilization building. Of course, 7 Wonders is not a classic civilization game, so that this game cannot offer the same fun with other classic civilization games. 7 Wonders shows highlighted elememts of civilization. Nevetherless, this is almost the only civilization game which allures normal users to enter real civilization world.

01/2017: Finally bought a new copy on discount through Amazon (US$30.99 +shipping); despite the exchange rate (30%) it's still better than CAD$60+taxes.

Bought at a discount because it was pre-owned and there's a ding on the corner of the box.  Also, four Age I cards have defect (replaced by Asmodee for free - 07/15.)  The iconography in this game are self-explanatory so I am planning on teaching my friends' kids how to play despite them being 7 and 9, respectively.

One of my favorites to take to a party where there are people who may not play boardgames.

The first "designer" board game I purchased on my own.  I had owned Catan and Carcassonne previously and 7 Wonders blew those games away.  

Fun to play, easy to teach - always a few interesting decisions every age (esp. the 3rd).  Have recorded 70 or so games with my group so far, and through it all 7 Wonders has stood as the best of the bunch.

For me, the game has little to offer anymore - I've nearly mastered the strategies.  The game is still a blast to play because the group really enjoys it and it brings us together in a resonable play time.  A classic for sure.

A great game. Easy to learn BUT because of the many icons it is not easy to teach to new players. It is quick to play, so it gets played a lot at my house. My kids, ages 8 and up, understand and enjoy this game. The parents can handicap themselves (start with less coins or start the kids with extra)when playing with younger players. Although the theme has been done before, the way it is played is unique, and it fills a spot in my collection no other game does. I highly recommend it in anyone's collection.

I don't grok the love that this game gets. Yeah it plays 7, but in practice it's just as if multiple 3-player games are happening at once. The icon-filled cards are quite confusing; I would never bring this out with nongamers. But what really sinks this game for me is the spreadsheet scoring at the end. For a game with supposedly no downtime, it sure feels like tedious sitting there at the end while everyone sits there calling out numbers while someone else writes them down or plugs them into an app.

Well I think I have played this game enough times to rate it now. While I applaud the concept of creating a fast paced 7-player civ game I really think the multiple paths to victory in this one are mostly just a skin to disguise points and they don't do that very well. Sure the game is enjoyable enough, but it is also kind of boring. I can only win by playing Green, and I can't be bothered playing green anymore. Victory, especially in large games, is mostly random. It does kind of depend on what your neighbours do and take, like if one of them plays no military then you need very little military to gain a lot of points. 

So yeah I think I have done my dash with this game. Rating is based on initial appeal, I've probably cooled to a 5 personally, but I think with gamers who are less into the strategy and control elements of games than I am will likely enjoy this for longer.

This is a mildly amusing and unoffensive card game. The only real negative is that the end game scoring takes a long time relative to the gameplay. It's really nice that the game scales so well to large numbers of players with no downsides. I see this game as useful mainly as a filler for relatively large groups of gamers.

Excellent illustrations, good graphic design, standard drafting, unbalanced wonders, sub-par interaction, disappointingly tactical, overwhelmingly shallow.

Best with 3 since you get to see your starting hand a second time, and you have to interact with BOTH your opponents.

The supported player counts and the playtime, coupled with theme, are 7 Wonders' saving graces. There are a few choices early in the game that you need to be thoughtful about, but after that it feels like the game largely plays itself. Resources don't seem like enough of a constraint by halfway through the game, and there are few interesting tradeoffs to make with each hand that is passed to you.

Resource and set collection game where you pass cards around the table and try to pay for the best cards to ultimately collect the most victory points. Nice looking game but I think the game may be a little over-rated because it is not a particularly unique idea or game strategy. The cool factor related to the 7 Wonders of the World and game graphics helps it score. You require a fairly balanced group of players to keep better players in check from chalking up a big advantage. Good, fun and fairly quick game for 6-7 players because of its simultaneous card play, but not the years best game IMO.

Card drafting, three rounds. Sits large number of players but only your neighbors influence your resources. Promotes some interactivity with trading resources and building wonders allows you to "hate draft" cards that would help your opponents.

total waste of a good theme.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It does just what it says it does, it plays 3 to 7 WELL and does it in 30 minutes flat. Its a filler with a weak theme so don't expect more, it does play well, it plays fast with no downtime and also keeps you interested. It also has that let's play one more game addictive quality.
 
I was leary about a game of just a pure draft and thats all but it works out quite good and shit it plays 7 players, how many games are decent and play 7 in half an hour?  That and it’s easy to teach mean its a great gateway game and this puts it on the wishlist for me.  

You are building up your player board by drafting cards, once you know the cards (which only takes one game really) you can do some planning on how you want to  build combos on the table (set collection). It's nice that the player boards push the envelope all a little differently too, so one board encourages to play a certain strategy and another board a slightly different one. 

The obvious comparison is to Fairy Tale but I'll do it versus Dominion. Dominion probably has a little more depth just because the cards you are drafting are face up and open to everyone where as here you know what you’ll probably get and probably need but it isn’t as certain. Once you own cards things are kind of flipped around because once built here they are on your board and stay there where as in Dominion the cards randomly come to you and you don’t know how they will combine. They are different games but fill the same niche of a good 30 minute filler, personally I give this one the edge due to scaling and no annoying shuffling, this game will likely make its way to my shelf.  

I do think replay with the current cards is limited to maybe 20 plays tops and some will be bored of the cards after 5 - 10 games. For me this isn't as big as problem since I want it for a filler only and for family outings *BUT* the BIG box and BIG price really mean they should have included a lot more cards which might stop me from buying it at the current price. Note the cards are a good thick stock but black rimmed and not that durable and this means unsightly wear on edges, and the cards are too big for regular sleeves :(

It is kind of OK but you are constrained by luck of the cards and the resources available to yourself and neighbours.

But what do I know? Took me a year before I decided that Dominion was good enough to merit me buying my own copy!

Would like to try with 3 or 4 players - plays so far have been 5 or 6 players which means you never see the hand again and some hands are just so "juicy" you want more than one pick from them, but that might just because there are more cards the more players you have.

Zuiderspel 9/4/2012, Eindhoven. Kort spel (30 min), waarin je je wereldwonder moet uitbouwen gedurende drie "eeuwen". Veel verschillende types kaarten die punten opbrengen, waardoor je op het einde een hele rekensom moet maken om te zien wie gewonnen is (tijdens het spel zelf is het niet altijd zo duidelijk wie aan het winnen is).

PRO:
7 Players; Simple to Teach and Play;

CON:
I feel the overall randomness of the cards you are given, and the actions of your neighbors, strongly outweighs the strategy you employ. 

I think that there is a chance that if you look at every card you can [legally] play each turn (maybe also including setting up your wonder if your have that capability as an option), assign a number to them each, and then roll to see which to do, you could still end up winning the game. The only argument with that is the preference you would show to science symbols, and possible military depending on your neighbors. 

In references to the actions of your neighbor: A neighbor that ignores military can give you an easy military victory each age, and a neighbor that doesn't purchase cards to block your sets of science symbols can let you walk away with a lot of points for the win.

This is an amazingly lite game of civ.  Even my dad was able to learn it (not a gamer) and whup my butt.  You get a big hand, play a card, pass the hand to your neighbor.  To play many of the cards, you'll need prerequisites (like a mine to make a necessary resource).  You build up victory points through various types of cards.  Very quick, little forward planning, challenging to make the most of each hand, very enjoyable.  Games unfold pretty much the same way every time so replay is somewhat limited.  Good for a once per session filler, especially if you have a lot of players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I was a little cool to this after my first play.  It took until the middle of Age Two before I "got it", and even then, I had no idea what types of symbols and cards were to come in Age Three.  It's clear there's a lot of replay potential here, and it's clear that, like RftG, there's a lot of value in knowing the general composition of the decks, even if you don't have the card list memorized.  It'll take 2 or 3 more plays before I can rate this fairly.  

Update: the official two-player version of this is underrated.  There's a lot more screwage and tactical play when you a) see each hand three times a round instead of once or twice, and b) can manipulate the dummy player's board to mess with your opponent.  I think I prefer the official variant to the "just deal three hands and take turns playing for the dummy" variant.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Much the way Dominion is the standard for deckbuilding games, 7 Wonders is the standard for card drafting games.

The chances I won't keep it in my collection are pretty low, but I don't find myself wanting to teach it anymore because it's not as much fun when a new player plays irrationally (makes sitting next to one really important to have a better shot at winning). It can also take up to an hour to play with new players due to explaining symbols and clarifying rules.

It's a classic, but I really don't see it as a gateway game anymore. For players new to card drafting, I recommend Sushi Go! as a better introduction to the mechanic.

Great fun, like Civilization on table top, mechanics take a few rounds to get used to but once understood you can really get into the strategy of it.

Great game for old and new gamers alike with the added bonus of scaling well up to 7 players with little to no increase in down time. In addition, the short play time make this a great game for casual gamers as well. Easily one of my favorites to introduce to new people. Nothing beats the feeling when the light goes on in their hands and they want to play another round (or ten!)

Symbols take away from the accessibility a bit but once players become used to them, this game flies.

After the first couple of plays, I rated this game 6/10. I absloluteley love the concept but at the same time I would had liked the games to be a little longer and deeper.

This is where Leaders and Cities comes into play and once I got the expensions, it had brought the game to another level. The expensions not only adds a few minutes to each game, but it added considerably more depth and strategy. This is one my favorite board game and everybody just loves it.

I really enjoyed this game the first time it was introduced to me, so naturally, I bought it.  I then moved and no longer had the large, veteran gamer group as before.  Every time I want to get a game going with a new group, I must explain everything over and over which helps me love the subtleties of the game even more.  Unfortunately, the newcomers complain that it is too difficult for them, so they ask to play Monopoly (shudder) instead.  Still would love to play this game - it left a sweet taste in my mouth from the first time :)

It's pleasant enough - and flows smoothly if everyone is willing to progress the game at roughly the same pace.  It becomes awkward with players working at different speeds, and the point-salad scoring is probably great once you've played enough to know everything that could come along, but I'm not going to ever do that.

I don't see this as a family game at all - and how it has reached number 1 on BGG in the family game section, I just don't know - well I do, most people have a different family to me.

Easy to learn, fun to play, quick and the more you play the more interaction you can feel. I.e. in the beginning your sole interaction are with the two players on either side of you but, later, you may start to have the wherewithal to think about another player's development and how you might hinder them.

There are so many strategy options in the base game alone that I am not sure why I have any expansions. Easily one of my top games, but I don't rate it as high because it's slightly over the head of my 8 year old and he's a core member of my gaming group.

A bit of a steep learning curve in the first couple rounds, especially for people new to board games, but it's a lot of fun!  Once you get through a couple rounds everything is easy to understand.  I introduced 4 people to the game this weekend and they all loved it.

RATING: 9
Excellent gateway game. The first half of every new player's first game you can see their mind is just BLOWN. After that halfway point, though, you see the pieces start to click into place. By the end of the first game (which should only be 30 or 40 minutes), everyone I have taught the game to totally gets it and wants to play again. Great!

Great game that keeps climbing in my list of top ten games.  Just enough strategy to please the strategy gamer while still fun for those who aren't as fond of strategy games.  What really makes this game great is the simultaneous turn sequence which allows up to seven (or 8 including expansions) players to play a complex game in a relatively short amount of time.  All new players seem to forget the rule of no duplicate building and have a hard time understanding prerequisites during their first game.

Initial Rating: 8.0

Thanks to all the hype out there, I was expecting an amazing game, 7 Wonders is a great game but not what I expected, I love civilization games and this one is not one of them, the theme is pasted on but I can get around that. I think it is one of the most versatile games out there, I like that it can handle 6-7 players in a short time frame, but the ideal in my opinion is 3-4 players, anything more and the players see too few cards (which greatly increases the luck factor), the game is not very deep, almost always it is more tactical than strategic as you react to the cards than you receive,  I consider it to be a "familiar" Race for the Galaxy (as both games seek synergy between cards) which by the way I prefer and recommend over 7 Wonders. On the bad side, the cards are of a very low quality, must sleeve ASAP. In conclusion I like 7 wonders, it is a very good game but I think it is over appreciated, I will buy it once the hype calms down.

Nowadays I find myself less interested in playing  this game, for me, it just doesn´t have a high replayability factor, I feel almost all games are played in the same fashion. I need to play with an expansion soon to see how the game changes.

Also counting the points at the end is a bore.

By standards of a 30minute filler game, it's great.  I'm not sure that I see the second coming that the lovers promised but it fills it role very nicely and occupies a niche relatively uniquely.  It's more Fairy Tale than Tresham's Civilization but within its obvious limitations, its great.  Not a Top 10 Game by any means but solid.

It's difficult to get inspired to make a creative comment about 7 Wonders.  It is what it is.  The drafting is interesting, and I'm sure there's a whole metagame around denying important cards to opponents while keeping a coherent strategy oneself.

In the end this isn't my type of game.  If I'm going to play a thematically challenged 30-minute card game I would rather play Dominion.  In particular I can't imagine playing 7 Wonders again without the Leaders expansion.

Very nice lightweight card game that plays fast and scales well with different numbers of players.

Simple mechanics, multiple ways of scoring points, and you need to keep an eye on your neighbours.

Especially early in each round you look at the cards you've got in your hand and think 'hmm, I'd like to pick about 3 of them', but you're only allowed one...

16 Jan 2011: I took my copy to my local game club (York's Beyond Monopoly - it's here on BGG) yesterday. I got into a 5 hour (including explanation) game of FFG's new Civilization, and jealously looked across to see my copy of 7W in constant play for the full 5 hours! 

I did get in a 4 player game of 7W at the end of the day, but to say it's going down well in these parts would be something of an understatement...

***Update***
While a great game not the best title of 2011.  Turns out 2011 was a stacked year for games.  Castles of Burgundy wins that title.  

I've not played this game for awhile now.  Not sure it has much fanfare in my group...I still think it's a solid title and not one I'm compelled to trade away.  Bumping my rating down to a 7 but still look forward to playing this from time to time.

I love the draft format.  I think I will enjoy this game more once I take the time to research and understand the upgrade paths.  As it is, I feel like I am just randomly picking cards without regard for an over-arching strategy.

I wish that there were more cards in each age.  I am used to Magic draft where there are three packs of 15 for an 8 man draft, as opposed to 7 "packs" of 7 for a 7 man draft.  There is not as much room for signaling, wheeling, and general maneuvering with so few cards.

This is a perfect game. The mechanics are simple and new players learn quickly. It accomodates up to 7 (a running theme, in keeping with the title) players with no lag in play time or boring waiting periods. It can be a genuine surprise to see who has won at the end of the game -- unless you keep meticulous track of what everyone else is building, which, admittedly, some people do consider fun.

I can think of nothing bad to say about it. It's one of the first nerdy games I was introduced to and I was hooked from the start. I, in turn, make it one of the first games I introduce new gamers to. It hasn't misfired yet.

7 wonders is an amazing game.  It is probably my favorite short term strategy game.  It packs tactical and strategic decisions in a 30-45 minute game.  Because everyone is acting at the same time, there is very little downtime.  There is luck in what cards you draw in what order, however, most of the time, your decisions matter.   The Cities expansion adds needed additional variety and depth.

I have played this game several times with my gaming group, but mostly with large groups. The first several times that I played it, I had thought it was awesome: So many different card types, so many different ways to score points, using resources that either you had previously built or paying for the resource(s) from one of your two neighbors. It was the first card drafting game I had ever played, and it had interesting mechanisms.
Fast forward months later, and it seems that the people at my gaming club have outgrown the game. While we would always play the game about once a week, the game just does not hit the table as much these days.
Because I was able to find it for a cheap enough price, I decided to buy the game myself (I would not have thought that I would have originally, since there are a lot of people in my gaming group who already own the game and I try to buy different games so that I can bring different games to play at the club).
I decided to teach the game to my family. We have played 3 different games so far. 2 of those games were 3 player games and 1 of them was a 5 player game. However, all 3 of those games were won by my father, using almost the exact same strategy every time. He would build a lot (but not all) resources early in the game, and then come Age III (and Age II, to start somewhat) he would gather and build most of the high scoring straight-out blue victory point cards. If you have a bunch of blue cards that you are able to build because of your variety of resources you built early on, and sprinkle in some military, and what do you know you have almost an unstoppable path to victory. I swear, there was one game in which my father gathered 30 victory points just in blue cards (8+6+6+4+3+3=30) While you can also scoring points from science cards, you need to commit and hope for specific cards, and on average / card may only net you 3.5 points/card. Whereas with blue cards, even snagging just one can give you 3 to 4 points minimum, going up from there. Also, my father was also able to execute this strategy in a 5 player game (although 2 of the players were new to the game in that particular case and were just catching on the strategy towards the end of the game), too, so although it could be that only the 3 player game is flawed.
Although I have not played any further games with my family, I believe that this game is so unbalanced, because I believe that the above basic strategy can be executed time and again and become a dominant strategy to winning this game.

I'm in minority of being bored by this game. Build a civilization, light and breezy with simple card draft (pick a card, pass remainder of deck to your neighbor). Not quite a filler but not quite a game either. Nothing wrong with it...passing-deck-around not my cup of tea. San Juan and Glory to Rome are superficially similar but feel a little more like I'm really doing something in front of me with other people. This feels like I'm playing cards over the internet.

Solid drafting, resource management game.  Yeah you are really only playing against the person to your left and right, but this one just never gets old for me.  Leaders expansion is a must, Cities I could take or leave.  Haven't played Babel...seems like this turns it into a whole different game.  Duel IS a whole different game.  7 Wonders is in my collection to stay and will be a favorite for quite a while.  Love.  Love.  Love.

I enjoy the fact that each game can feel different if you want it to.  I am sure there is an optimal strategy for each wonder, but I don't play enough, and frankly have no desire, to figure that out.  More just a fun light game to play with a bunch of people.

Non-gamers have a very hard time with the rules of this game. For this reason, it is actually a poor choice for the main situation where people want to play it - as an opener in a mixed group of 6 or 7.

Pros: 
- Plays very fast on everyone's second game; can take under 45 minutes with 7 players.
- Nice, consistent iconography (YMMV!)

Cons: 
- Heavy rules considering the length of the game.
- *Not* a good icebreaker in mixed groups - Too complicated.

I've only played this once so far, but I think I really like it. As has been mentioned elsewhere, the card drafting mechanic makes for a nice, quick game. It's the kind of game that is fun enough at first, but the strategy and game play get much deeper the more plays you have.

Update: I have played this many times since I originally rated it, and I really enjoy it. What it has that other drafting games don't is a phased approach that allows you to build on previous rounds (Ages). It's really a brilliant game.

Bought this and it became a massive hit amongst my gaming group within the first year. Although the concept can be a little tricky to explain to new players, once they've seen a round or two played it normally clicks.
Really enjoy this. I particularly like the way there are several routes to victory with valid strategies for each of the different kinds of cards.

Wow, one of my first game purchases ever! Still a solid game, but it would have been traded away by now except for two things - 1.) Rach loves it 2.) I won a professionally Pnp'd copy of several fan expansions which are quite neat. - August 2013

Joguei uma vez no Encontro Semanal do Porto, cortesia do Pedro, acompanhado ainda pela Maria João e pelo João. 
Gostei imenso. Tem uma das melhores mecânicas de jogo que já vi. Muito bem conseguida. É no entanto algo complexa para menores, apesar de não ter dependência de língua, e é igualmente desaconselhável para jogar com quem não está a habituado a jogos de tabuleiro. Entretém. Recomendo bastante para grupos de adultos com alguma experiência.

The box says 2 players are possible... it lies.
Basically, it's card drafting with the hopes of getting the right combination so that you "build" your monument, but that's it: once the card is taken, you do nothing with it. Too many players = no chance at choosing multiple cards per round.

PLUS: easy to learn, plays quick
MINUS: boring -- doesn't encourage table talk or player interaction

RATING: 7
The basic gist of the game is to play cards to get access to resources and money, then use resources and money to buy cards that get you points. You can buy resources from your neighbors on either side if you don't produce them yourself. Military cards create a kind of majority game with your neighbors - you get points if you have more swords than they do. Each player is also given a play mat, and each mat shows a different wonder that can be built in 2 or 3 stages. The benefits that come with each stage are unique for each wonder. The game play is simple. Everyone is dealt a hand of 8 cards. On a turn, you play a card from your hand and then pass the hand to your right or left. Play a card, pass. Play a card, pass. The last card in each hand is discarded. Do that for 3 hands (there's a different deck for each hand) and then the game ends. It probably plays in less than 30 minutes with experienced players.

I think the game's main strengths are its short play time and high possible player count. It plays up to 7! The game play is pretty strong for such a simple game, although I suspect 90% of your decisions are based on what you need more than what your neighbor needs. Of course, the box is 4 times larger than it needs to be, probably to house the massive number of expansions this game will probably inspire. This game is worth having for me simply because of the player count. If it only played 4, I might not bother trying to acquire it, but since we are trending high on the player counts these days, I think it has a place.

7 Wonders seems at first much more complex than it is... it's a great quick play. I was the one who had to explain the rules to everyone (since I had played several solo games myself) and I learned that in the explaining, I missed introducing all the various ways one can gain Victory Points. I think new players should play several games one after another to get a "feel" for the game.

When my group dynamic changed, I needed a shorter game that can play as many as possible.  This was a grand slam in that regard.  Everyone is playing all the time, and everyone has a lot of fun.

A solid 7 for this one, based on about a dozen plays thus far.  Not sure I like the marketing hype (reminds me of Agricola) where they didn't have sufficient English editions at the start then suckering everyone into buying one.  Anyway, hope to get my copy soon.  Game plays quickly, multiple scoring options, but the card-passing mechanic has been seen before (Fairy Tale, Notre Dame) and there's not alot that's terribly new or innovative.  Think it's going to be alot like Dominion for me, alot of play at first, then kind of a lowest common denominator game, when people can't agree on what to play.  The darling of this year's Essen crop, it's shooting up the BGG rankings as I write this -- but long, term, does it really deserve anything higher than a 7?  The ability to play with 7, however, is a big plus, however.

Sept. 2011 Update:  Still maintaining my rating of 7, and should add it's probably the one game most played over the last six months, not so much because of a desire on my part, but just that  it's become a "lowest common denominator game" that everyone is willing to play -- it's quick, if you don't do well you can blame the luck of the cards, it plays with 7, etc.  I suspect it's alot more likely that the game will get played less and less as time goes by, and the one thing I am hoping for is that someone adapts some of the more creative elements here into a meatier game -- sort of like how Martin Wallace has taken Dominion to a new level with "A Few Acres of Snow."

You'll rarely refuse to play because it plays fast (although setup time is not negligible), but it's too light to be loved. I think that knowing each card for each era, including its cost, could boost the enjoyability very much because you could plan things much better.

Quick and neat with little downtime.  Good ideas, but the simple min/max points from different categories is kind of boring.  I don't have the WOW! impression I had with Dominion but it has lasting power.  The Leaders and Cities expansions are nice additions.
Update:  actually, 7 wonders is pretty cool.  Definitely a strategy game rather than a tactics game, which is my preference.  Seems to play different every time ... not sure why though.

I went into this game biased, as I have been keenly interested in the Seven Ancient Wonders of the world for some time, have devoured books on them and even created this geeklist last year on games related to the Siege/Colossus of Rhodes (one of the Wonders). So, kind of a given that I'm all over the theme of this one. The art doesn't disappoint, absolutely beautiful and detailed, and so much better than the underwhelming Tower of Babel art (another 7 Wonders game). Some of the best art I've seen this year.

The gameplay itself is a pretty straightforward card game of building and developing, kind of a light civ game arc. What I find really cool about this one is the overlapping "trios" around the table; you're intensely involved with each of your neighbors, who are each also involved with both you their other neighbor, etc. There is also a ripple effect around the table based on cards played/drafted/passed. Very interesting dynamics and not one I've seen before. It's not as "group social" as for example a game of Bang! or Werewolf, but it's still far from solitaire.

It's a perfect game to play in those 30 minutes where you have 4-7 gamers already and are waiting for the last few to trickle in so you can split into 2 tables.  Up there among my favorite card games along with Biblios, Citadels and Verrater.

This is an empire building game in which players have a hand of cards from which they select a single card and then pass the remaining cards to the next player. Some cards generate resources and others require those resources but generate victory points. Some cards can give you cash and there are also cards that as you have more in a set give increasing amounts of victory points. There are also military cards and these are needed to keep up with your neighbor. It is also possible to buy resources from your neighbors. I like that the game seems fairly simple to learn, but offers various paths to victory.

Great depth for the amount of players it can handle. Some mechanisms can be a little counter-intuitive (how to use/buy resources) or complex (scoring with science) but feel like it flows well for new players past the first age. 

Love the tension of having to pick a card now or hope that it comes back when the hand gets around to you again. Also deciding between cards that give instant point gratification vs. long-term potential is always fun. Great game!

Great game. FEELS like a great civilization game but plays like a simple, quick card-drafter...without losing the pros of either. Main problem is that it just doesn't work well with two. Dummy player is awkward and there's no easy way to get around it do to left-right player mechanisms. Also, science scoring. There's nothing WRONG with it, but it trips up every single new player and they either fight for it when they shouldn't or largely ignore it to their peril.

Fast and fun, 7 Wonders lends itself to repeated plays if only to play out the "what if" scenarios. Having dominated one game with a military strategy, only to have it fail miserably the second time, I can appreciate the ability and the need to adapt your strategy based not only on the cards that are available, but also to the actions of your neighbours. To that end, the game feels more controlled with 3 players, as you can try to counteract what your competition is doing. Beyond that, and there are one or more players that you will have no influence on - a limitation that can be at times both exciting and infuriating. Ultimately (and, as always, with the right group) 7 Wonders ends up being a surprisingly fulfilling yet still wonderfully short and fast game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I've played this exclusively with 4 players in a family-type setting, but I've quite enjoyed it.  We've played a lot of Sushi Go over the years, so we're well prepared for the drafting aspect of it, and I like having something (a little) more meaty to put on top of the drafting.

My son picked up the game very quickly - as with other tableau / engine builders he doesn't really worry too much about what other people are doing, he just wants to build cool stuff.  So far, that means you can count on him rushing the Wonders or Military, but I'm sure that as we get more plays he'll change it up to focus on Science or Cash or whatever.  

This will definitely be getting more plays, and I'll have to revisit.  I'm also curious how it plays with differently sized groups.

7 Wonders has grown on me more than any other 2010 release. Went up from an intial 7/10 to 9/10.
---
7 Wonders topped out all the Dominion clones as the buzz game of the Spiel 2010 in Essen. To be fair, it's not one of them. It's more a full-blown boardgame version of Fairy Tale coupled with the desire to design the ultimate 30 minute civ light game of building up your tech tree. The surprise is that it's successful at conveying that you are building a civilization in this short time! Combine this with the ability to host 7 players as well as a good accessibility for new players and you have a clear winner - even for people like me that are not to keen on engine building games where knowledge of each card is vital for good play. It's not as deep and varied as Dominion though and probably not as expandable.

14 Feb 13 Really enjoyed this game to start with. A lot of fun adjusting building strategy on the fly as you get various hands of cards to choose from. Then couldn't win it and started not to like it. Encouraged by group to keep playing. Finally had a win and a tie for win and am now enjoying it again. 
What we love the most is its playing time. Around 30 min (sometimes less) no matter how many players. Extraordinary!
Want to buy the Cities expansion.
Have moved this game from a 7 to an 8.
8 Mar 13 Okay, love this game again. Have now won a few times, so losing doesn't bother me anymore. Oddity - Sometimes, it's hard to figure out why you actually won. Sometimes, why you lost. Bumping this to a 10 as it always hits the gaming table before we play anything else. Have just bought Cities. Am waiting for it in the mail.
UPDATE - 2 Sept 16 Still love this game. Awesome. Don't like the Cities expansion much but really like the Leaders expansion. Still a 10. This game has real staying power. Now own 7 Wonders: Duel and that is equally brilliant. Great to be able to play a 2 player game.

Beautiful components. I would play this game for the pretty pictures alone. Incredibly balanced though. Maybe not the first game I would pick for a non-gamer though.

Edit March 2017:

Doesn't scale well with more than 3 players. Not enough control. Typically those who have uncontested military will win.

Outside of building the wonder, this game feels backward. It completely lacks risk vs. reward. Instead of working hard to acquire resources to achieve big payoffs, it's just a bunch of small decisions that yield 4 vs. 5 points. Pleasant, but not engaging.

It's quick and fun, and quite attractive with it's art.
The balance between different strategies impressed me.
Never "exactly-the-same" game twice, so there's huge enthusiasm to play it again and again!
Playing with fewer players maybe is more attractive because of adding some strategical depth.

I don't like playing this with higher player counts. You won't see any of the cards again during the draft. I'm not convinced that the cards added for each player count scales appropriately. Also, your seating position can really hurt you in this game. For 3-4 players, I enjoy playing this

Love the tension of card drafting--perfect mix of strategic planning with just enough randomness to keep you on your toes. Scales from 3 to 7 players effortlessly; with 3 or 4 players, it's a tight, strategic battle, but as the player count rises, the game opens up and feels more random and casual (which is generally ideal for larger groups).
Definitely a gateway+ game since it takes longer to explain than the typical gateway game, and since the game builds up over 3 ages, it takes a play or two to understand how choices in the early game affect the later game. However, once new players get the hang of the iconography and flow of the game, it's easy to play (and get to the table).

The only thing 7 wonders has going for it is that it's game that can be played quickly with 6-7 players. Though with that many players the draft seems to lose what little strategy it had: the whole game becomes an intensely tactical affair.

Can't imagine wanting to play this with fewer than 6 players though. There must be a lot of easier filler around.

This game was out constantly when I first bought the game. It is the easiest of all the games I have played to teach and learn. That said, it is easy to learn but to understand properly use the cards I think a few games is in order. by the second game that is. I really enjoy both 2 player games and games with more than 2 people.

I have few complaints about this game besides the guilds which sometimes are super beneficial to a single player but that is it.

RATING: 6
Really good and quick strategy game as far as card games go, and plays just as fast and well with 7 people as it does 3.  Doesn't hold rich historical insights, but the art on some of the wonder boards spawns good images for roleplaying games. 
So overall a good and fun game, but card games (with some notable exceptions!) don't hold much of an allure for me in comparison to strategy games, wargames, or roleplaying games.

los componetes son muy bien logrados y la ilustración muy bonita.
El desarrollo del juego es bastante ágil y la mecánica utilizada de rotación de mazos hace que la planeación a futuro sea difícil ya que en el próximo turno de ese mazo es posible que no encuentres la carta deseada. 
Quizás uno de los juegos que mejora con la inclusión de mas jugadores.
Proximo objetivo conseguir las expansiones con el objetivo de completar la serie de 7 Wonders. Pero hay que resaltar que el juego por si solo es demasiado completo y de alta rejugabilidad.

What's not too like? Since it can accommodate up to seven gamers, it's very easy to get to the table and even the people who are all like "No, you guys play, I'll just sit here and read this book" are usually up for some 7 wonders. In addition to that, it's also just a fun novel citybuilder with player-interaction (competitive and not), a great theme and the feeling of actually building up a marvelous civilization. Sadly, there's not that many cards, so after a while you feel you've seen it all.

A very quick game, which is easy to learn. Nevertheless, it has enough different paths to the victory. Interesting aspects are buying resources from neighbours and also the cards with rewards depending on the results of neighbours too. In other words, it is not enough to look at your own board only. It is essential to know, what your neighbours are doing, what cards do they need and what cards could be used to your advantage.

Itin greitas ir lengvai perprantamas žaidimas. Be to, turintis pakankamai nemažai skirtingų kelių į pergalę. Įdomus resursų pirkimo iš kolegų aspektas, taip pat kortelės, kurios duoda efektą priklausomai ir nuo kaimynų rezultatų. Kitaip sakant, neužtenka žiūrėti vien tik į savo lenta, reikia domėtis ir tuo, ką veikia kaimynai, kokių kortų jiems geriau būtų nesiųsti, o kokias lengvai galima panaudoti savo naudai.

Played this game so much in my college years. In fact, it was the only time we had an actual board game that played all 7 of us together.. But now, it has gone a bit stale for me as there better games out there. Also, the lack of player interaction outside of your immediate neighboring people are non-existent and therefore, you have no control over their victory progress

Better than in games where you all your cards are hidden that is.

If you've played a lot of for example Fairy Tale or Dominion it will be easy for you to pick up 7 Wonders. It is kind of a building drafting game with reasonable amount of player interaction.

RATING: 5
The resource system seems to be there to ensure errors are made, and makes it just too much for it to be a true gateway or a truly quick game. Most of the high scoring cards being based on your neighbors' cities means that what you do matters little compared to capitalizing on what they do. Military is a false interaction, where actually focusing on it is terrible strategy: if you have to invest a lot, you're losing ground compared to all non-neighboring players.

RATING: 7
This was an initial hit with my group but we've cooled on it significantly.  The mechanic of passing hands is certainly unique and interesting.  Frankly though it feels like the same game every time I play.  Get resource cards early, try to get sets of green, maybe go for war cards depending on what your neighbors do.  Ho hum.  The leader addition adds some to the game but honestly not enough to make the game feel any different.  Honestly, and I can't explain why, many people I've played with just can't grasp the cost of cards and can't figure out how the card hierarchies work.  I find myself constantly playing rules police which greatly takes away from my enjoyment of the game and probably takes away from the enjoyment of everyone else as well.  I haven't cooled enough on it to let it go but at the same time I haven't been suggesting it for play anymore.

RATING: 7
On the one hand, it's a very fast game. On the other hand, it's... a very fast game. You do the old resource acquisition/victory points conversion routine, and then you look up and see whether someone else got a better deal, and whether your suboptimal plays intended to curb the guy next to you were in any way worthwhile, and whether the other guy next to you similarly managed to screw himself and you. Some cards will be hideously effective in the right position (and useless to the person charged with keeping them from getting there), while others are a crapshoot. I think this might belong to a category of games that just don't interest me that much (San Juan, Saint Petersburg, Dominion), but I'd play it again to make sure. It is after all a very fast game.

First impressions confirmed: I am not good at this and I don't care to be. But it's very fast.

Later impressions: It is in fact better with few players. Adding more dilutes the draft and means you will be competing against random scores across the table you have no meaningful relation to. Can be a 6 with two or three; can be a 4 with five or more. Still very fast.

Last (?) impressions: A 7 with three, deduct one point for each player above or below.

I find myself entirely disengaged from this game, in part because the theme seems entirely irrelevant. It feels like a messy, contrived and inefficient way of collecting cards. As a consequence I just sit and wait for my turn, with no interaction with anyone, and hope than nobody suffers from too much AP, or tries too hard to calculate what some other player has scored so far. I never care whether I win or lose or what is happening to my collection of cards. I understand that there’s some skill involved, but for me there is just too much luck and not enough strategy – the fact that I won my first game against 2 very experienced players is enough for me to never want to play again. With larger groups the luck increases and there's less and less reason to hold onto any card that doesn’t directly help you.

The best way to increase your chances of winning this game would be to have a perfect memory. Since I don’t care about it enough to try to remember the cards, the probability of me winning is a random function of the actions of the other players, coupled with my own rather haphazard decisions.

Nearly perfect.  I mean it...absolutely perfect, for what I look for/need in a game.

It handles up to 7!!!  In a quick and streamlined fashion. (Although you lose a lot of "control" over the game and its outcome...)
It offers tons of choices.
It's expandable (which I eagerly anticipate).
It's portable.
It's fast to set-up, play and re-play.

Only niggle is that :
1) it is easy to make mistakes during scoring (there's just a lot to keep track of)>  So, everyone help each other with your scores and all should be fine.  

2) it's a tad luck driven depending on seating arrangement, Wonder draw, Guild draw, etc.  But it plays so quick it doesn't truly affect the score imo.
If you have a rash of bad luck, just play again!

Great theme, I love it. Also, I have to adore the game for a very simple reason: it has made drafting popular again while still comaing across as a relatively simple mechanism. It doesn't scare new players off.

However, I must admit I have played it enough. These days, when it hits the table I'd prefer playing something else. I can't even bring myself to fully commit to a running game, just going through the motions.

But yeah, still a great game.
Also love the alt art boards!

The guy who beat me twice, and mercilessly, has won 9 out of the 11 games he's played, so apparently you can be good at 7 Wonders, but it's clearly going to take me some time to figure out how. How much do you really adapt to your wonder? What do you actually do that's different every time, people-who-are-really-good? 

Anyway, it's so simple, intuitive, and quick (no matter how many people you're playing with!) that I can't imagine not loving it.

Fun drafting game.  I am consistently terrible at it, but still seem to nearly eek out a victory, or at least come close.  I think an intimate knowledge of the cards and what could potentially come your way is what you need for any kind of long term strategy, and even with that there are times where you simply can't do exactly what you want to do without a card tabling, and that usually doesn't happen (and flat out CAN'T happen in the 6-7 player variants.) Strong game overall.

With 6-7 players it's pretty light and easy to teach other players usually can't hurt each other too badly, which is usually a good thing with larger groups.  

With 3-4 players it's very strategic and filled with meaningful decisions, usually a good thing with smaller groups.

The art is beautiful, the game plays quickly the system is clean and easy to understand.

RATING: 7.8
7 wonders is a very good game:

PROS

1. It is popular with lighter gamers even though it has a fair amount of depth to satisfy more involved gamers
2. It is efficiently paced, never drags.
3. you are allowed to be clever, and the game rewards you well for good decisions. 
4. very rare to to be done over by luck if you are a good player.

CONS

1. Easy for a player who doesn't know what he's doing to frustrate someone who does know what he's doing through unbalancing the game dynamic, so can get annoying.
2. First few plays will be a bit uninvolving because you do need to generally know the cards to get into it properly and enjoy it/work out a strategy
3. Depth goes to a point, after which there is nothing left, therefore not top 10 material. Once you hit the glass ceiling (takes a fair few games, so lots of life there) it gives you an empty feeling and becomes a game you dont mind playing and enjoy but would not really go out of your way to play particularly...

I like 7 Wonders. I don't love it. The casual gamers I know like it far more than I do, likely because of two key virtues. One is that it's a 30-40 minute civ game, when most of them take several hours. The other is that the drafting and simultaneous selection minimizes downtime. I don't find the game sufficiently deep to hold my interest. There isn't enough opportunity to carry out strategies with a high level of confidence, or develop creative strategies based on what other players do. I rarely think "next time I'll try this approach." Games that make me think about my next play always rate higher in my books, and 7 Wonders falls short in this regard. Even so, I enjoy playing 7 Wonders because people I enjoy spending time with love playing it. That's the main reason it will remain in my collection. The expansions have added some interesting elements, but not enough to change my overall rating.

RATING: 7.5
This gets a lot of play based on the short length, and scalability from 3-7 players.  You only get ~18 cards to play each game, so practically every decision point is agonizing.  It is a game of almost pure tactics, with very little long term strategy.  Also, for a game straddling the "gateway/family" line, it can be difficult to teach to newbies.  This is the reason I haven't ventured into any of the expansions, since I frequently find myself playing this with first timers.

Not much to say about one of the best boardgames of all time. Game looks gorgeous, plays fast and there is enough weight for gamers and non-gamers (Although Sushi Go Party! might be a better start for non gamers). If anyone said lets play this I'm already setting it up to the table. Also these opinions are without any expansions for the game. I think I would like this even more with leaders or cities expansions.

After so many games the novelty has worn off, but the game is still very nice. For some reason I seem to be unable to win it, probably have to look over my (poor) strategies. Lately I've included the Leaders and Cities expansions as must haves and start to think about them as part of the base game.

A clever game of drafting cards and building up your resources and buildings.  Nicely plays a large group because of simultaneous play.  A game with zero downtime!  Nicely done!  The famous criticism for this one lies in that you mainly are only paying attention to the players to either side of you, so the other players aren't affecting your gameplay and vice versa.

A filler, and better with as many players as you can get to the table. I find the 2 player variant too predictable. Its not the greatest game ever, nor indeed is it worth the hype that seems to have surrounded it on this website.

7 Wonders is a such a beautiful game.  I'm a sucker for nice artwork.

But it's functionally nice too.  There's just enough player interaction - in terms of competing for cards and military power - to keep it from being group solitaire.  However, there's not so much interaction that someone can devastate your plans or play kingmaker.  I like games that strike that balance.

This is perhaps the only medium-weight game I've seen that has you saying "let's play it one more time--right now!" after every game.

Card drafting to the core, 7 Wonders does great with both gamers and non-gamers. I can see how the limited interaction with non-neighbors could lead to some frustration, but I believe this will mainly be a problem when playing with a group of mixed experience levels.

Easy to teach, plays fast and is a lot of fun. There are so many strategies to win and it's possible to switch strategies mid-game if necessary.

This is a strong game with wide appeal, made better by expansions but fun on its own. Easy to get to the table for people with more than passing interest in gaming, but unsuccessful with game-resistant family members. Still working on perfecting the method of teaching, as eyes tend to glaze over when going over rules (might just resort to YouTube videos in the future). Hasn't come to the table super recently (only because we've tended toward newer games in our collection), but likely to make its way back to the Top 5 once the new game smell wears off. The companion app is well worth the effort - scoring is by far one of the most tedious parts of the game and the app streamlines scoring and logs plays well. Haven't yet used the app-specific civ, though.

RATING: 7
I'd say this game is about a 7, but easily gains an extra point for being the best filler, period.  I'd give it 8.5, even.

This game is simply a must-have.

No matter who, what, when or how, you can always get a game going.  You can play with gamers or casual players alike, or even people who have never even played games before.  You can play with 2 to 7 players and you can explain the rules in about 5 o 10 minutes.  It plays under an hour, no matter the number of players.  Again, it is simply the perfect filler.

But let's be honest, gamers will not enjoy this one as much.  A lot of luck is involved in the draft (especially in the 3rd phase), the quality of your neighbors, and the purple cards.  It can be a bit frustrating for the hardcore gamer who feels played a good game, but loses nonetheless.  But generally not enough to refuse to play.  However, it makes the experience for the casual gamer extremely pleasant.

We pretty much always end our boardgame nights with a game or two of Seven Wonders.

One of few games i own that can be played by up to 7 players. Despite that adding players just adds more people to the "hand passing ring", you are still only really looking usually directly at the player to your left and right anyway, so a 7 player game still feels like a 3 player game (of course not the same, but similar). 
But it is a very quick game, and you get the reward of building up your city and upgrading buildings for free is fun! The quick play time, means you want to play again straight away!

Not seeing the wonder here.  As far as family games go, this is not one I would spring on non-gaming family or friends.  It plays quickly because of simultaneous action resolution, i.e. the drafting mechanic, but with no sense of joy and no feeling of connection to the other players that you typically get from playing the best "gateway" board games with non-gamers or lighter-style gamers.  
I've had far more fun and more social experiences playing Settlers (if they think fondly of Monopoly), Ticket to Ride (if they like traditional card games) or Bohananza (if they like games at all and humorous haggling, basically).

This is a hit. Played it four times now and I'm impressed how different the games felt. There is always at least one ressource very scarce, which even leads to several later buildings not being played. The impact of the 2nd step of the wonders is not minor as well. And we even didn't try the "B-sides" yet. Overall I've got to say, that the very high price was worth it. I'm really satisfied with this buy. It's Dominion-esquely good or even better.

Great fast game for up to 7 players that you can easily play in 30 minutes. Very easy to teach new players. Great filler game after you play your other game(s) and you don't want the night to end, but don't have time for a longer game!

Szuper játék! Kell idő a szabályok elsajátításához, ahhoz meg végképp, hogy rájöjj, mit érdemes megtartanod, építened, és mi az, amit nyugodt szívvel továbbpasszolhatsz. Vagy várjunk csak... Lehet, hogy mégsem, mert azzal pont jót teszel az ellenfélnek? :)
Mindenesetre egészen gyorsan lemegy egy parti, és azért érdemes tervezgetni, gondolkodni, még úgy is könnyed szórakozás. :)

A tentative 6 after a single seven-player game. Felt very punishing for not having an efficient plan in place from the start, but I ended up scoring a lot better than I expected to. Not sure if this cancels out. Only being able to interact with adjacent opponents felt greatly thematic, but a bit pointless to have everyone else there.

Excellent game that is easy to learn but has an incredible amount of strategy with multiple ways to victory. My first "advanced" board game purchase and one of my favorites of all time. Great theme, great variability, great art, and elegant gameplay. Best with four players in my opinion. Playing with a full 7 players can be a bit chaotic.

I've played this a few times now.  It has been received rather well by a number of differing people.  I don't hate it, but there is something that annoys me about this game.  It is almost too slick, too programmed.  It's like Muzak, instead of real music.  I feel like the game flow is overly produced, and I have no chance to do anything remotely unexpected or original.

This game is good, but I always get the feeling you will get points whatever you do. You can never really be proud of your strategy. You won military, but the other guy won economic and the other one science... or every one screws each other strategy and everyone end up even. Beautiful game with a great feel, but I quickly get bored.

What can be said about 7 Wonders that hasn't already been said? It's a wonderful (dohoho) drafting game that focuses on equal parts points engine and opponent screwing. 7 Wonders plays fast and offers plenty of options to attain victory, but does focus heavily on iconography which may be a bit challenging to new players. However, it's intuitive enough that most players will want to play time and time again.

Easy to learn and teach. Generally welcome with casual and committed gamers. No real shortcomings and it scales astonishingly well with different number of poeple (3-7)

Leaders is interesting expansion to change the game and add variation. 

Cities adds some welcome player interaction. Of the two i think city is the better expansion.

Never liked this game as much as everyone around me seemed to, hence the less than stellar rating from me.  It's all just "ok".  Maybe its that I'd rather play a much more involved Civilization game if I'm going to have that theme on something.  Or maybe its even that 7 Wonders Duel is so much better from a design perspective.  I'd still gladly play this one but it's all so very "so what" these days in my mind.

Great design where player count doesn't impact game length. After a few cards the choices become more obvious so its a bit limiting. Drafting is fun and I think it is a bit better with less people. You can start to gauge what will table and what will not make it back to you. Fun and quick but scoring is still a bit long.

RATING: 7
The real deal when it comes to "civ-lite" - almost to the point of being super-lite given the short playing time. But in spite of how quick the game is to play, there's a good deal of strategy and tactics packed in, and you really do have some sense of building up an ancient city over hundreds of years of history. Once you're set up you can easily play several hands in a matter of a couple hours, and while the cards are generally the same your hand from turn to turn will always be different, giving you different difficult choices every game. A solidly designed game, and I only wish the cards were stronger so they didn't need sleeving.

RATING: N/A
Wonderfully balanced game that I think plays well with all player counts. I like the idea that only the players to your immediate left and right really impact what you do in the game, but you're also racing others around the table. Would add to the collection, but Repos is on my shit list...

RATING: 7
Includes the Expansions:
7 Wonders: Catan (English/German first edition)
7 Wonders: Cities (English first edition) (2012)
7 Wonders: Leaders (Repos Production English First Edition)
7 Wonders: Wonder Pack (Multilingual first edition) (2013)

The tower part of the Babel expansion quickly got old. In a game where you only play 18 cards, having something that can change the rules to the extent that you are stopped dead in your tracks is too much grief to bear. I had to ditch that expansion.

7 Wonders is a good light card drafting game with a ton of expansions. The problem is, people suggest it whenever we have six or seven players, and that is the worst version of the game. By far, the base game is best with three players, since you will actually get to see the cards you pass to other players come back to you twice. Also, warfare plays a more significant role when you border the only other players.

I have also been having a lot of fun with the Cities expansion, and I definitely prefer that version of the game. Diplomacy further marginalizes warfare, but that's OK, as it gives you cards you can easily use to build stages of your wonder. I'm not sure the three player game works with Diplomacy, simply because it can completely destroy a military player's engine. But then again, with Cities you get to play another card, so four players becomes a great option for 7 Wonders + Cities.

Another bonus to 7 Wonders is the fact that it works beautifully as a family game.

[b]My thoughts:[/b]
Somewhat simple/repetitive, but I love the addition of leaders to the game to create a more unified strategy. Also science seems like the way to go if you want to win more often than not and with leaders it can become way powerful. Great replayability despite how little variation there is with the cards-thanks to the drafting and wonder board element.

Feels kind of generic. Pasted theme. Get money and buy cards. I wondered where the fun was. 7 player solitaire with very occasional interaction. Just read a review that reminded me of the scoring and damn that was painful to remember so I lowered my rating. Adding up the final score took too long at the end of the game and unless you are rainman you have no idea who the winner will be until after spending 10 mins totalling up the score.

Love drafting mechanics. Great replayability with the multiple different boards and 2 sides for each. Game is extremely better the more people you have.

Good theme, fascinating drafting mechanic, plays quickly and has multiple routes to victory.

RATING: 6
Slightly more than a “gateway,” this popular drafting game has a lot to like. Plays up to 7 players (although I like it with 3-4 much better), plays in about 30 minutes with experienced players and appears to involve meaningful decisions all result in a good all-purpose game for most collections. Despite this, I consider it well within the “filler” category and do not take more seriously than it deserves. As with many card games, your choices may be obvious depending on what cards you get. Also, your neighbor’s actions can influence your outcome as much as your own. With random Guild distribution, the luck of the draw can determine if your path will be a successful one or not. Also, some wonders appear to be better than others under certain situations. Nevertheless, I find it a fun game to play. I am often more interested in trying a certain strategy or achieving a certain score and less concerned if I end up winning or losing.

It does take a while to explain (15 min or more depending on the listening skills of the other players), but this game is completely worth it! There are endless strategies depending on which wonder you play with, and what type of cards reach your hand first. I run out of friends willing to play with me long before I get tired of playing.

Отличная драфт-игра для больших (до 7-и игроков) и малых компаний. Простые правила, минимальная продолжительность игры (30-60 минут, которые практически не зависят от кол-ва игроков), чувство удовлетворения от сотворения чего-то своего - всё тут есть.

Дополнения немного меняют игру, но в целом делают её ещё лучше и насыщенней. Повысил рейтинг до 9/10.

Great card drafting game. A bit dry with 3 players, and a bit too luck-driven with 7, but great with other numbers. I prefer 5, but both 4 and 6 work well. Interaction is indirect, but constant: you have to continuously keep in mind what your neighbours are doing, as you are affected and can affect them in multiple ways.

7 Wonders isn't all that deep or interesting of a game, but it has two saving graces that makes it see plenty of play: even with higher player numbers 7 Wonders plays exteremly quick and has almost no downtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Bit of a learning curve as playing it requires knowing the contents of the deck (and scoring is multi-faceted) but once up to speed is an accessible and fast-playing Civ game.

That being said this is the game's largest appeal. It stops short at mechanical depth as it is... a drafting game. That's it. If you want quick(ish) Civ in a draft, this is your game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Card drafting is an excellent mechanism and should really be used in more games. Downside is that even though it is a fairly simple game it can be somewhat difficult to teach to new players. Works with 3 all the way to 7 players...2 not really.

This is a clever and well designed game which I can bank on enjoying. I think the hype has overtaken reality a little here - this is definitely not a gateway game like several suggest. For one, it is not an easy game to teach unless the players are receptive.

Rather, this is much more an impressive "gamers' filler" for my mind.

After my first 3 plays I would have given that game a 3 rating, since people didn't explain the rules to me very well and I didn't really know how it works and it was a real mess. However I bought it and I bought it just for the reason that I really liked the theme and the cool artwork and I generally love card games and card drafting. So after I bought it and read the rules myself and got to learn the game I started to love it. I don't like victory points collecting that much and don't like Eurogames or games that are very close to Eurogames, so it just gets an 8. If there would be a little more player interaction and less "solitaire" in it, it would be a 10 rating :-)

This was one of the first "designer" board games that I was introduced to a few years ago. I love the drafting mechanism (it blew my mind the first time I tried it) and often use it to bring in new gamers. As a historian, I love recognizing the places and especially the leaders. Unless I am introducing it to a new player, I never play without the Leaders expansion.

Okay quik card game. I didn't have the feeling i was accomplishing anything but i see why a lot of people like it. 
Problem might be a weaker player to your right might help you get the win. 
I took hard looks and tI left the player to my left behind me. Probably should have played more for myself.

edit: I was thinking of picking this up . but there are plenty of games I would rather play with nong gamers or/and gamers. So the most correct rating would be a 5.

If I decide to pick it up, I'll up my rating again.

edit: decided to get it as it is such a hit with many and if you want to introduce new people to the hobby this isn't too bad.

Very creative and inventive. Taking the drafting mechanic created by CCGs like Magic The Gathering, and making a game around it. The only thing that I suggest about this game is do not judge it based on one play. The first time you play it you are more or less playing to learn how cards work, and what you need to focus on. After that first play the game becomes much easier, and you really start to feel like you know what you want to do with the game. The only true gripe I have is not with the game itself, but with the rules. The rule book is kind of dry  and a little bit confusing. To be honest I learned to play this by watching a how to play video. Other then that though wonderful game and truely a modern day gem.

Everyone I talked to at BGG.CON really liked this.  I briefly saw people playing it and wasn't that excited, but then talking to arkibet at the airport afterward convinced me to take another look.

[b]Update:[/b] bought this as a birthday present for myself.  8 games so far, 3-6 players, I haven't won once.  I've been beaten by 8-year-olds, first-time players, and people who don't even [i]like[/i] games.  THIS GAME IS BROKEN

[b]Update after 45 plays:[/b] everyone in my family will play this (including my wife, who generally hates games), so that's good... [i]but,[/i] this game is "just OK" to me.  (The Leaders expansion improves it significantly, as it gives you more long-range goals than "well, I'm Babylon, so I guess I'm going science.")  Normally you get to make 18 decisions per game, and as the player count goes up, you have less information on which to base those decisions, so gameplay is mostly seeing whether the cards go your way.

(Several times now we've had games where someone's gotten hosed--being unable to finish, or even [i]start,[/i] their wonder because other players are burying the cards they need, or because they just got unlucky--and this can make the game not-so-fun for that person, because there's nothing they could have done to prevent it.  At least the game is short...)

So, I like that it's simple and approachable and scales to many players (and I think it's fine 2-player with the "free city" rules included in the game), [i]but[/i] it's so light that it's basically filler.

This is an OK game, despite long explanations of how to play, the game plays quickly and is easily picked up, and in most cases where others have been taught they new people are keen to play a second time. This happened at Christmas where I taught 4 others how to play before Tea when we had one game, they then wanted to play a second time after tea. This is actually a rare occurence with most games (immediate replay request) and says something about its initial appeal. Don't know if it will stay the distance - I will probably get browned off with it after the 4th expansion set......

There was a large unrecorded swath of 7 Wonders games that we played when I first acquired the game, probably dozens of games that ran one into the other.

I still love how well the simultaneous drafting helps keep even large games moving along quickly.

RATING: 7
Good game. 7 Wonders is a quite abstract (theme is just pasted up), but it doesn't mean the game is bad. It actually offers lot to do and no downtime WHICH mixed with the short playing time MEANS that the game works. There are some issues too: very small icons (and unnecessary big pictures) in cards which makes it a bit too hard to really get the overall situation clear. Another minus is, that every game feels a bit same than previous ones, because you play every game with the same cards (and use almost all of them). But still... yes, 7 Wonders is one of the best games released 2010 although it's far from GREAT. Vut sometimes all you need is a game, which you are play again and again... and I'm happy to play this game every now and then! ;)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.

I've played this game about 10 times now, and I still don't find it very exciting or immersive. The theme is a bit weak, and you can't really tell who is going to win until the very end, unless you REALLY pay attention and count people's points constantly, which is pretty difficult.
The good thing about this game is that it can accomodate up to 8 players with the expansion and can be played in less than an hour.
I'd recommend it for more casual gamers.

December 2013 - 7 Wonders is probably my favorite "gateway" or "flex" game. It is smooth to play, always enjoyable, and the fact that it plays quickly with 5-7 players is a real treat.

If you're not in the mood for a bluffing/betrayal game like Avalon, Coup, Saboteur, Resistance, etc but want to entertain 6-7 people, bring 7 Wonders out.

Awesome drafting game.  Will always be up for playing this game. Really enjoy playing it with people that already know how to play due to the strategy of the game and how quick it will play if everyone already knows how to play.  Awesome part of this game is that you can play with 3 or 7 and still takes almost the same amount of time. I haven't played with any of the expansions as of yet.  Looking forward to picking up some to see what it adds to the game.

It's fun enough to play as it has almost no downtime, ppl can drop out when they want and it has a nice buildup. We use this to get a big group together.

Impressive card drafting game that weirdly feels like a cross between Fairy Tales (drafting, scoring) & Catan (resources).  Also somewhat reminiscent of Glory to Rome with cleaner & faster play.  Very fast with impressive depth & strategy given the short length.  Scales ridiculously well, supporting up to 7 players with gameplay that remains consistently interactive for all (since all play simultaneously).  A must have.

It wasn't until finishing my first play of this game that I realized just how good it is.  Like just about everything.  Tough decisions, multiple paths to victory, plays super fast, easy to set-up, clean-up.  Only thing lacking is maybe player interaction, but there is enough of that for me.

RATING: 6
The concept is interesting, it is one of the few card drafting games that I enjoyed to play. One of the reason why is because the memory aspect is not very important. You don't need to remember what are the cards in circulation like in fairy tales.

The problems in this game is that as the game progress it gets much slower and annoying. At the beginning of the game, you follow you instincts and what you need. But as you progress through the game, all cards have resources requirements, which requires more calculation. 

And then at the 3rd age, everything gives points. So you are always trying to calculate the Victory point generated by every card in your hand to know what is the most valuable card. So it now becomes just long, annoying and not fun to calculate.

Else, I would say the the game play is pretty simple and ingenious, and I quite like the fact that you can use adjacent player's resources by paying them.

In general, It's a relatively good game. I would not mind playing it again.

LIKES:

* Plays 3-7 equally well but with a bit of a different flavor.  However, I find I prefer 3-4 player counts to allow for some potential planning ahead knowing you'll get some cards back from your starting hand.
* Each monument has different special abilities which bring some LIMITED extra replayability.
* Several viable different ways exist to score and win.
* I enjoy the card drafting element that is central to the game.
* Makes an excellent filler that plays in 20-30 minutes and is easily and quickly taught.

DISLIKES:

* Each person's display takes up a lot of table space.
* Lacks many interesting decisions.  
* I do have some concern about replayability as the game may feel samey after a while.  However, there are allegedly expansions coming out which may help provide difference in play.  This is not a deep game by any stretch.  After 8 plays, I am feeling a good bit more "meh" about this game.  I expect to keep it around since it is easy to teach and understand for people and plays 7, but this isn't one I expect to be clamoring to play very often.

Heten játszottuk, ebből egyvalaki ismerte csak előzetesen a játékot. A szabályokat az első játék alatt teljesen sikerült megérteni, szóval könnyen tanulható. Ha a tanulást leszámítjuk, elég pörgős, gyors játék, szerintem nem nagyon lehet 3/4 óránál tovább elhúzni. Minden cselekedet párhuzamosan történik, emiatt egyáltalán nincs benne holtidő, amikor várni kellene a többi játékosra.

A játék alatt mindenki építgeti a saját csodáját, és ha nem lenne elég nyersanyag hozzá, a két szomszédos játékossal lehet kereskedni (ez a kereskedés nem igényel interakciót: egyszerűen odaadod neki a cucc árát, és ennyi (a nyersanyagok nem materializálódott formában léteznek), azaz ha valaki kereskedik veled, akkor ezt abból veszed észre, hogy odarak eléd néhány pénzérmét).
A többi játékossal való kapcsolat kimerül tehát a kereskedésben és abban, hogy próbálsz a lehetséges lapok közül olyat beépíteni a csodádba, amire vagy neked van nagy szükséged, vagy amire a melletted ülő játékosnak lenne, ám te éppen ezért elhasználod előle. A nem közvetlenül melletted ülőkre csak még közvetettebb módon lehet hatni: felhasználni olyan lapot, ami majd két vagy több kör múlva neki nagyon jól jönne... De ezzel nem nagyon foglalkozik szerintem senki, csak a közvetlen szomszédaival és önmagával.

Interaktív elem a játékban tehát alig akad, de mégis sokat kell figyelni a közvetlen szomszédok lépéseit, nem lehet csak magunkra figyelve játszani (vagyis lehet, de tuti nem fogunk nyerni).

Mikre kell figyelni?
1. A saját haderőmre a szomszédaiméhoz viszonyítva (ha erősebb vagyok, plusz pontot kapok, ha gyengébb, mínuszat).
2. A nyersanyagforrásaimra: szinte biztos, hogy legalább egyvalami hiányozni fog, amit a szomszédjaimtól kell majd beszereznem kereskedéssel. Érdemes tehát olyan nyersanyagforrásokat beépíteni a csodánkba, hogy a szomszédjainkéval együtt teljes legyen a paletta.
3. Figyelni kell a technikai mérföldkövekre: saját részre ugyanabból a típusból minél többet összegyűjteni, de a szomszédjaimnak minél kevesebb összegyűjtésére módot adni. Ennél a pontnál érdemes az összes játékos csodáját figyelemmel kísérni, hiszen láthatjuk, hogy az egyes technikai vívmánytípusokat hányan gyűjtik - ha sokan, inkább másik gyűjtésébe érdemes belekezdeni.
4. Sok speciális kártya is van, amik szintén a szomszédjaim lerakott lapjaitól függően juttatnak engem különböző előnyökhöz.

A játék nagyon sokrétű, ez a pontozásnál jól látszik. Mindenkit 6-7 szempont alapján pontozni kell, és e részpontok összege lesz az adott játékos végső pontszáma. Sok pontot lehet szerezni a technikai vívmányok összegyűjtéséből. Sokat ha a seregem nagyobb a szomszédaiménál. Sok összegyűlhet, ha közvetlenül győzelmi pontokat építek a csodámba. Ha a játék végén marad pénzem, az is pontot ér. A sok speciális lap is pontokat ér, a legkülönbözőbb dolgokért lehet velük pontokat szerezni. És akkor egy csomó minden van még, ami most épp nem jut eszembe...

Szóval gyakorlatilag bármit csinálok, pontokat fogok kapni érte. Ha sikerül jobb kombinációkat összehozni, az sok pontot ér.

A játékban a fő döntési helyzet az, hogy az adott körben a legfeljebb 7 lehetőség közül melyiket válasszam beépíteni a csodámba. Ez gyakran nagy dilemmát okoz. Egy kevésbé fontos másodlagos döntési helyzet pedig az, hogy ha mindkét szomszédommal tudok kereskedni, akkor melyiküket válasszam, azaz melyiküket erősítsem a pénzemmel. Egyéb döntési helyzet nincs, de az elsőként leírt tényleg súlyos döntés, hiszen azzal határozom meg, hogy mit csinálok az adott körben - el lehet rajta gondolkozni rendesen, és tipikus, hogy háromszor is meggondolja magát mindenki, miközben kiválasztja a lapot magának.

A játék szinte teljesen nyelvfüggetlen. Néhány csodához tartozik egy egymondatos speciális képesség, ami szövegesen van megfogalmazva, de ez egyáltalán nem okoz nehézséget. Minden mást szimbólumok jelölnek, amik kifejezetten könnyen megjegyezhetőek, egyszerűek. tehát egyedül a szabálykönyv elolvasása igényel nyelvtudást, a játékelemekre lehet mondani, hogy nem.

A játékélmény: pozitív. A főbb tapasztalataim: könnyen tanulható, gyors, folyamatos és valódi döntéseket igénylő játék (azaz nem csak báb a játékos, akinek mindig pontosan tudható, hogy mi az optimális lépése, hanem ténylegesen az ő kezében a döntés a jövőjéről). Tetszik, és akarok vele máskor is játszani! Úgy érzem a további játékok vele növelni fogják a rá adott pontszámomat.

I don't know why I waited so long to try 7 Wonders, and its not that actively avoiding trying it, but when I finally did get to play i thoroughly enjoyed every second of it. This game fits right in my wheel house for what I enjoy and look for in a game. Multiple strategic paths to choose from, quick playtime, ease of understanding for new players, and difficult choices all mark this as something that I need to have in my collection. I played my first game with both the Cities and Leaders expansions and that may have been a little bit too much for first time players in terms of iconography in the game, but with quick summaries on the rulebooks even those were not a problem most of the game. This game is simply a fun, and I can't wait until I can play it again.

4-7p

2p variant:

8p variants:

1/  With 7 Wonders base set and Leaders exp. (Catan Island promo board)
Note: Due to limited numbers of cards, Catan Island B cannot be played at the same time as Hanging Gardens B.

SETUP:
1. Remove the blue Pawnshop (7+) card from Age I. Use all of the other cards.
2. Remove the yellow Bazar (7+) card from Age II. Use all of the other cards.
3. Choose 8 guild cards and shuffle them into Age III. Set the other guild cards aside. We will use them later.
4. Use every leader card. Semiramis is required. If you do not have a rule set aside for her, I would recommend: "Cost: 3 Coins. Power: Semiramis can learn from her defeats. Every negative military token acquired counts as one war power for the upcoming ages."

GAMEPLAY
1. During Age 0 (choosing leaders), deal 4 cards to every player, and build your Leader deck as normal (take one, pass to your right). This should use 32/36 cards.
2. In each Age, deal 6 cards to each player. Instead of the normal rule, where you choose between 2 cards on your last turn and discard the unused card, you will only have one card to play.
3. Play as normal, following the rules for the Leader expansion.

CHANGES TO WONDER/CARD ABILITIES
1. Colosseum B, 1st Stage - Draw 3 Leader Cards instead of 4
2. Hanging Garden B, 2nd Stage - Draw one more Leader. You may immediately play an extra Leader Card from your hand by paying the usual cost. (This is the same ability as Catan Island B, Stage 1)
3. Mausoleum A, 2nd Stage; Mausoleum B, all 3 Stages; Solomon Leader Card - Choose one other player, and look at the cards they used for their Wonder stages. Choose one of the cards and immediately play it for free. Replace that card with one of the unused cards (pawnshop, bazar, or the 2 extra guilds).

---------------------------------------------------------

2/  With 7 Wonders base set and Catan Island promo board.

SETUP:
1. Remove the blue Pawnshop (7+) card from Age I. Use all of the other cards.
2. Remove the yellow Bazar (7+) card from Age II. Use all of the other cards.
3. Choose 8 guild cards and shuffle them into Age III. Set the other guild cards aside. We will use them later.

GAMEPLAY
1. In each Age, deal 6 cards to each player. Instead of the normal rule, where you choose between 2 cards on your last turn and discard the unused card, you will only have one card to play.

CHANGES TO WONDER/CARD ABILITIES
1. Hanging Garden B - Not playable.
2. Catan Island B - Not playable.
3. Mausoleum A, 2nd Stage; Mausoleum B, all 3 Stages - Choose one other player, and look at the cards they used for their Wonder stages. Choose one of the cards and immediately play it for free. Replace that card with one of the unused cards (pawnshop, bazar, or the 2 extra guilds).

---------------------------------------------------------

Variante pour Leaders:

Draft L02

Chaque joueur reçoit 5 cartes Leaders, en défausse 1 (face cachée) avant de passer les 4 cartes restantes à son voisin de droite. Le draft se poursuit alors comme L01 et chaque joueur se retrouve donc avec 4 cartes Leaders pour débuter la partie.

Draft L03

Chaque joueur reçoit 5 cartes Leaders. Le draft se déroule comme L01 mais quand les joueurs reçoivent 2 cartes de leur voisin, il en choisissent une et la deuxième est défaussée (face cachée). Chaque joueur se retrouve donc avec 4 cartes Leaders pour débuter la partie.

Précision pour L02 et L03 : si vous jouez à 7 joueurs, vous avez besoin de 7 x 5 = 35 Leaders à distribuer sans compter les Leaders supplémentaires que nécessitent le plateau « Rome » et éventuellement le plateau « Bruxelles » (A) s’il est placé à côté de « Rome ». Pour éviter la pénurie, les Leaders défaussés lors du draft (L02 et L03) réintègrent la pioche et peuvent être réutilisés par « Rome » et « Bruxelles » durant la partie.

Really great game, and the best in its category. There's a reason every drafting and set collecting game is inevitably compared to 7 Wonders, and it's not just because it was one of the first designer games to be successful with the mechanics, but because it's still the best at employing those mechanics. The expansions make this game even better, with more replayability and even tougher decision making.

This game will be a fantastic experience for a group of gamers who know it well and are competitive when playing. The general game play mechanic is sound and the paths to victory are balanced. Problems lie in the flooding of iconography for new players, who never seem to really know what's going on until near the end of the first game. If they are willing to play another then all is well but most that I have played with were not interested enough for a repeat play. There seems to be some issues with components quality too, with the insert inside the (stupidly oversized) box useless and the cards wearing very quickly.

A Race for the Galaxy light, that can be relatively easily played with new players.  A little faster than Race, a little less downtime (the choices and combinations are more obvious).  A hit with the family (one of the few times were J or E asked for another game).  Since I love Race, but E does not like it so much, 7 Wonders is a keeper, that fills the role of a challenging-enough fast game (30+ minutes).

I do not find the interaction much more interesting than in Race.  In particular, the social interaction is not much more present.  In both games, I spend about as much time thinking about what my opponent are doing than in Race.

Rules: I forgot quite a few rules, up to my 3rd play (at least).  I don't remember having so many problems with Race, whose rules are maybe a little more streamlined and natural.  Rules I missed up to my 3rd play:
1) I forgot the change in the rotation direction between Ages.
2) I missed the rules that resources can only be bought from wonders+brown+grey cards (not from the yellow, commercial cards, which represent interior markets).
3) I missed the rule that earned coins cannot be used immediately. For instance, they should be put *between* players and collected along with the cards passed along (or by themselves, for coins passed in the reverse direction). 
4) I missed the rules that cards must be played face down before any action is started.

Easy to learn and multiple ways to win. Pretty art on the cards. Fun, quick and light game for social occasions! Science seems a bit too powerful though. Also you need to think a bit on your strategy, so not a good game to play if you and your companions are tired. The game isn't very meaty as the mechanic is just drafting cards. A good game nevertheless.

RATING: 6
This game is great for a scenario where your gaming with a large group of players, and many of them are new to gaming.  Everyone can stay together and play one game that moves quickly and is relatively easy to pick up on.  The issue is a player needs to completely understand all the symbols before playing or that player can hold up an entire round.  This can isolate new players and feel overwhelming.

Taking the scoring system literally, I would rate this an 8.  I rated it a 9 due to sentimental reasons.  Everyone in my family loves it and it was really one of the first designer board games that I purchased and enjoyed.  If I wouldn't have enjoyed this game so much there is a good chance I wouldn't explored other games and the hobby.

[b]Wonderfully scalable card drafting game that plays super fast for a large group.[/b]
r{[i]7 Wonders is a good, quick microcosm of a civ game.[/i]}r

SYNOPSIS
Players start with unique resources and goals for building the wonder on their player boards. Then the card drafting begins. Each opportunity to pick a card provides good decision points throughout the game such as when to gather resources or build out with the resources currently available, when to choose a favorable card for oneself or remove from your opponent's reach a powerful card for them, when to build up military or science knowing that it will affect how those around you draft their cards thereafter. Finances are a concern to manage well all throughout. Each age ends with a concise battle for which one can prepare by building up defenses or attacks. There are different routes to victory including through use of military, science and culture cards.

COMMENTS
Often this game's ability to scale extremely well from 2-7 (8 with Cities expansion) without adding much to play time is given as one of its positives, but I'll also add the game play itself is noteworthy. It does an admirable job of mimicking civ building by way of card drafting. Plus it does so elegantly and quickly.

PROS+, CONS- & NOTES*
+ Tons of variety and replayability with this one.
- Focused reliance on immediate neighbors during game play results in lack of interaction or concern for other opponents.
* I recommend checking the math of neighboring opponents for accountability. Honest mistakes can happen if left unchecked.

RATING: 6
Mechanics of simultaneous game play works well for keeping kids involved, as compared to turn based strategy games.
The many different game elements and complex scoring model makes optimal strategic play too cumbersome for the fast action the format creates socially.  So best for groups to play more socially than competitively.  In other words, make a reasonable choice quickly instead of looking for optimal choice and everyone will have more fun.

This was my [url=http://www.daveexmachina.com/wordpress/?p=4805]Game of the Year[/url] for 2010. It looks like a chaotic mess, but it’s super easy to teach and pick up, and it plays lightning fast. Out of the box there are lots of different ways to approach it and mix things up a bit, and it can be easily expanded. It scales easily from three to seven players, and since the action is more or less simultaneous, adding more players doesn’t increase downtime. Everyone I’ve played it with has enjoyed it and been up for another game of it immediately afterwards.

I've only ever played it with new players.  It's hard to grasp on your first play (true of lots of games), so it'll be interesting once everyone has played it a few times.  I really like the drafting mechanic, withholding cards my neighbor needs.  The quick play time with many people.  You do need a big table to play with more than 3 or 4 though as the tableaus can get big.
Plays surprisingly well with 2 without losing the feel of the game.  I like trying to setup the dummy player to pay me money.

I like 7 Wonders but it seems a little incomplete. There is little doubt as to why 7 Wonders will be expanded 7 times. This is a Euro game so it takes awhile to memorize all of the symbols, but it's worth the price. Take a moment to purchase Cities and Leaders, however, as they fix the problem of army buildup and enhance the science track. This game is absolutely nerve racking and the winner really isn't known until the final tally. Well worth the play, but not my favorite game.

I'm not sure how to rate 7 Wonders. It's so much fun to play, and yet at the same time it's just not all that much depth to it. 

And yet, I'm hard pressed to name any game that plays up to seven people in about half an hour that's actually interesting. I guess time is really the key point here; no matter how badly you might be doing, it'll be over soon. And you can just play again. 

Or to paraphrase a friend of mine:
I don't feel bad about losing; I can't imagine feeling good about winning; I make some decisions, am informed of a result, and go about my day.

We had been curious about [thing=68448][/thing], especially after all of the attention that it had garnered when it was released.  It sounded almost like a holy grail---this was a game with good decisions and great artwork that scaled from 2-7 players.  How could you not have it in your collection?  So when we found it for a good price, we ended up getting a copy (as well as a copy for my sister).

When my sister visited over the holiday break, we took the three player game for a spin.  I think part of the hype of [thing=68448][/thing] is justified.  It's a very attractive game with great artwork.  My wife and I always enjoy these types of tableau-building games, so we felt more or less at home already.  However, it's still fairly easy to pick up and almost ventures into gateway game territory---my sister is not a hardcore gamer, but she was able to enjoy the game pretty quickly.  At least in the three player game, there's some nice interaction with the card drafting and you have to pay attention to everyone's tableau.  I wasn't a big fan of the iconography (some of them still remain a little confusing to me), but it was still an enjoyable game.  I can see how it would work with more as well.

However, after my sister left, my wife and I broke this out for just the two of us.  Generally, we don't mind dummy players too much---we enjoy [thing=6249][/thing] and [thing=66188][/thing], but the dummy player in both of those games is relatively easy to use.  In [thing=68448][/thing], the dummy player mechanic felt needlessly complicated.  Instead of just looking at your own tableau, you now had to look at the dummy player, so it felt like you were playing two boards.  Instead of just dumping cards, you had to consider all of the options that the dummy player could actually build, which actually took us a little bit of time to calculate all of the available resources, which card would benefit us more than our opponent, etc.  All of this was on top of the same type pf calculations you had to do for your own tableau.  Perhaps it will get better over time, but it felt like too much effort.  

If it was just the two of us, we would probably pass on [thing=68448][/thing], but it's a good game to keep in the collection when more people are over.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Strategy vs luck: I think there's a good balance here.  There's definitely a lot of strategy, and the strategy involves what the people next to you are doing a lot, and what the general populous is doing as well (if everyone is going for green cards, then you should definitely not do that strategy, for instance).  But there's also quite a bit of luck, to the point that you can't be guaranteed that the best player always wins.  So I wish the strategy-to-luck ratio were a little bit higher...but hey, this is a gateway game to eurogames, so I don't really consider that a serious problem.  Just a quibble.

And then there's the best part of the game: the drafting mechanic.  It makes the game even more interactive because you're thinking about what you're going to give your opponents.  This might be the best game with the drafting mechanic although it's not the first.

There are multiple paths to victory, but I've noticed that a lot of the time, the person who won had to get VPs from almost every category to do so.  Not all the time though; I just witnessed a winner do it from basically only 3 categories.  So again, that's a quibble.

Replayability: good.  Even without the expansions I've played this many times and not had issue.  I can always go for different hybrid strategies and there are not only 7 wonders, but two sides to each wonder, which each play differently.  Combine that with the fact that I'm dealt different cards each round so no hand will ever be the same, and you have pretty high replayability.  There's also slightly different compositions of cards for different numbers of players.  

Now I will say, replayability isn't perfect because after all, you're pretty much always just building cards.  But that's where the expansions come in; I just played Babel and it's great.  It adds extra options for each turn and gives me a chance to add even more strategy to the mix.  

Are all the paths to victory balanced?  Well, sort of.  But again, it really matters on what people around you are doing.  You could waste a lot of turns on a war with your neighbor to have more red cards.  Or you could waste time doing green cards when other people are also doing them and decreasing what's available for you to score big.  So, while a couple of types of cards are oftentimes stronger, it's very situational, and I like that.  It basically means that this game doesn't have to worry about being extremely well-balanced.  (And from the best I can tell, they are fairly balanced btw.  Maybe reds are a little less than others.)

Theme: I feel the theme pretty strongly, mostly because of the art.  Every card has good art on it and your boards are really nice panoramas.  Now I will say, do all the mechanics necessarily fit thematically?  Such as the drafting mechanic?  No, not perfectly.  But the drafting mechanic is what makes this game great and I'm not sorry for it.  And then there's several other things that contribute to the theme, such as warring and trading with your neighbors, and each country/wonder being a little differentiated, and the global supply.  So I have no complaints on the theme.

Component quality: great.  The only thing that could be better is metal coins; but pretty much no games have those, and hey at least these look like coins even though they're cardboard.  The art is really beautiful too; one of the top 3 games I've ever seen in terms of art.  Overall, they paid attention to detail with these components and nothing seems crappy.

Length is great.  We oftentimes play in only an hour.  It's really impressive to pack an awesome euro-gateway-game in only an hour.  The game basically doesn't get any longer for having more players (unless multiple of them are newbies and you keep having to help them individually).  But even with noobs, it doesn't take more than about an hour.  This is amazing.

It does feel samey after a while without expansions, and the expansions haven't clicked for me yet.

Because this game is so well-rounded, and it is outstanding in the length category (can't think of any game with a lower length-to-strategy ratio), and because I only have 3 minor quibbles with the game, I rate this highly.

Each time I have played I find it just lacks 'fun' - I am not a big fan of card drafting to begin with and the game has to be something special for me to like it and not be the main mechanic of the game... but in 7 Wonders it IS the game.

To add to that 7 Wonders is convoluted beyond belief, many tout it as a 'simple' gateway game, I disagree with that notion as it takes many, many playthroughs until you can develop any kind of strategy. Seasoned players that know the cards and combos have a huge advantage over those that don't.

It took some getting used to with all the rules and everything but once the ball starts rolling you will have people requesting to play it again. The interaction isn't much to shout about; you only directly get to interact with players on your left and right, that's it. However the theme is great and downtime also minimised with everyone drafting a card at the same time each turn. It can even be played up to 7 players, what a party!

I enjoyed 7 Wonders, and if you are a fan of the new wave of euro engine card games (Race for the Galaxy, Dominion and it’s imitators) I would strongly recommend that you try it out. While direct comparisons to those other games are superficial, there’s no denying that it’s becoming a genre.

The main draw is the drafting mechanic. While it’s as old as Magic: the Gathering booster drafts (about 15 years), it hasn’t been heavily explored yet–Fairy Tale is about the only other major game to try it out. It has the virtue of keeping the game moving at a decent pace (everything in 7 Wonders is keyed off what card you draft, including a couple of “pass” actions which require discarding a card). While things can seize up with players who are unfamiliar with the cards (my game was one veteran and five newbies), and experienced group should finish a game in 20-25 minutes, probably faster with a smaller group.

As much as I enjoy 7 Wonders (and I do – I will happily play it again soon), it’s a little hard as a fan of rich, meaty euros not to notice a couple of places where 7 Wonders could have been more interesting. The resource mechanism is a bit dull – it promotes some player interaction and keeps the rules density low, but the decisions are rarely tense. Either your neighbour has what you need or she doesn’t. Frankly, this is a problem with most post-Caylus cube-pushers (7W doesn’t use cubes, but the feel is similar), so it’s hardly fair to single out 7 Wonders, but a problem is a problem.

Also, the elements – military, economic, science, monuments/structures – are distinct silos. With one notable exception, there are no instances where building up your science helps your military or improving your economic power (beyond basic resource production) makes scientific progress more efficient. In some cases, playing a card will let you play a card from another silo for free later, which is a nice touch, but it only comes up if you see the relevant card and if playing it will help you out more than the other cards you have to choose from at the time.

Finally, it’s weird that the purple guild cards – analogous to 10-cost buildings in Puerto Rico or 6-cost developments in Race for the Galaxy – score points based on your neighbours’ position. It creates an incentive for your right-hand neighbour to take a different path than your left-hand neighbour, but the main effect is to give you much less control over which guilds are useful to you. It’s bizarre that the capstones of your game have nothing to do with what you’ve played up until now.

Nevertheless, these are quibbles. The card drafting is fun, that game’s arc is a little forced, but reasonable for a short card game and once you know the cards better, the game will go quickly. Like the start worlds in Race for the Galaxy, the different powers of the different wonders will help to keep the game from feeling *too* much alike from play to play. Unless you are completely europhobic, it’s certainly worth trying out. It may not be every gamer’s cup of tea, but the overhead for trying it out is low.

While there is no direct interaction in this game, there is plenty of indirect interaction in buying "resources" from your neighbors, though I dislike that besides hate drafting key cards there's not much you can do to players not adjacent to you. There are a lot of icons but they are pretty intuitive.

I understand why there are only enough cards as enough for the starting hands for balance issues, but I wish there was more variety of which cards came up. I feel like this game will get quite a bit more stale in the future unless you constantly play with different player counts. The different starting wonders do add some variety but I don't think necessarily changes up your play style by a huge amount.

Despite these flaws this game seems to have good strategic depth especially for such a short game (I am only at the level where I am only concerned about what I can do to boost my own points, whereas a better player could figure out how the cards drafted would help their neighbors, and an even better player could extrapolate further), plays a wide range of players at least somewhat well, and has great artwork.

I enjoy games in which a deck is passed and you have to strategize and make a risk-reward decision with each hand you are given! It is fun seeing how each player decides to build his or her deck, be it with raw resources (my traditional strategy), military power (usually my husband's choice), or science and structure building! It is not overly competitive and easy to play through if you want a quick half-hour game.

A crowd-pleaser, plays in half an hour regardless of number of players (up to 7, 8 with Leaders), very little downtime, beautiful art, lots of variety.

Over time, it has lost some appeal to me, being a bit lighter on the strategic side, although Leaders has helped give it a bit more spice again.

This started out a 9, and is more like a 7 now.  It's not the game's fault though, it does what it does very well.  We've just played it to death.

This is a great game. Easy to teach. Easy to play. And never boring (unless one player take 5 minutes to make each selection). Plays well with any number of players (except for 2, it should not be listed as a 2-player on the box). I enjoy the fact that the different starting boards force you to go with a different strategy each game. And unless we are playing 7 Wonders as a filler, we end up playing two games in a row (three if we need a tie breaker). Also, it's easy enough for kids so this is a good fit for families.

This is one of my favorite light games. The base game has so much to offer and the expansions build perfectly on top of the base game. The only problem with the game is that, while it says it can be played with 5-7 players, the game excels at 3-4. The few games I've played with more than 4 players is just a crap shoot. Every game I play I try a new strategy, slightly changing up what I did in the pervious game. If I have 45 minutes to kill, this is the game I want to play.

Good fun. I enjoy it, but now I have Among the Stars I think I would have little reason to play this, except it does not take up as much table space as AtS! But a solid game.

Edit: I have now played the 8 player team game (Cities) and it was a lot of fun. It becomes a very different beast when you are colluding with your partner. I would happily play this again, but it does really need everyone to know how to play in advance. A lot of fun though.

RATING: 7
4 plays with 5, 6, 7.

I have to start off by saying that I don't think that I care for this game with 6 or 7 at all. It simply takes most players too long to make their decisions for a game this light. 

I've said it before and I'll say it again; this is an upgraded Fairy Tale and that's a high compliment in my world.

A game like this should be played fast and dirty. You can always play again or even several times in a row.

Update:

More plays and I'm still interested in exploring the game space more. There certainly are strategies at hand here. We always make sure that the purple/bonus cards that are being used are fully revealed and explained to allow for some long term strategy and planning.

My only real frustration is that often you lose by mere points through no fault of your own. It's still short, fast, and interesting. Certainly a fine replacement for Fairy Tale of which we have played far too much.

Simple drafting game.  Remarkable in that the player count doesn't really affect the game length.  Neat synergies, but you have less control than you might imagine.  This isn't to say that there isn't strategy, but there's a larger luck component than initially hinted at.

Got 7 people who want something meatier than Bang! to play? Here is your winner. 7 Wonders features simultaneous turns, keeping the pace up no matter how many people are playing. It works with 3 players, but some dynamics change when you have 4 or more because certain actions are restricted to the players on your left, right, or both. I'd try to play with more than 3 whenever possible, but the game is still a lot of fun in smaller groups.

Teaching this is a pain, what with all the icons and the various scoring systems.

As far as play goes, it's a tactical drafting game. Take one card from a set -- either the one that's best for you (usually) or the one that the guy next to you really needs (occasionally), then give the rest of the cards to that guy. Rinse and repeat.

Some sort of strategic plan tends to emerge about halfway through the game, but the eventual winner seems to owe a lot to how useful his neighbor's tableaus end up being. The Leaders expansion helps set up a strategy sooner, but I'm not sure how much it mitigates the luck-of-the-neighbor effect.

RATING: 8
The most versatile and most-played game in my collection next to Splendor, it sits in kind of a board gaming holy grail. Has a place in every game night from 3 to 7 players, with any number of new and experienced gamers. It is the only satisfying medium weight game that can play 7 and has interesting decisions without dragging all night, but also really lights up at low player counts where you see the same hand more than once and really try and work out what your friends are going for.

Simultaneous turns keep everyone happy, and the wonder building is easy to understand. The more I play it, the better it gets, but I do need an expansion or two to be really excited about a game of it now.

It is obviously not perfect; the eventual payoff of any decision becomes more random the more players you add, and Halikarnassos is awful unless players are discarding cards you need (which would be terrible; better to take them yourself or build your wonder than waste a turn).

I am interested in playing 7 Wonders, especially as a lunch time game with 5 or more, though I don't feel much need to own it.  Roll Through the Ages fulfills my 'light civ-game' needs (plus that plays 2).

Very good card-drafting game with an awesome theme. 

It can be overwhelming to learn at first (it's very difficult to predict what will be effective in the later rounds when you haven't played much before) and there are tons of choices to make, but it feels very fun and rewarding to watch your strategy unfold successfully once you've gotten the hang of the game. 

I'll say that Sushi Go is a better card-drafting game for newer players, as the mechanics are very similar but the design is much more approachable.

A medium-weight civilization card game.  Experienced players can have a lot of fun with this and play it quickly.  One down side is the game takes about as long to teach as it does to play.  But the complexity is not so bad.  Like most card games you will enjoy it more as you learn the cards and combinations.  Excellent artwork.

I would not view this as a perfect gateway game though as I have played with non-gamers and groups have struggled with this.

Card game con meccanica draft.
Ad ogni turno si sceglie una carta dalla mano e si passano le restanti al giocatore successivo.
Con le carte è possibile produrre risorse con le quali costruire edifici, meraviglie, tecnologie ed opere di guerra.
La cosa positiva è il poter adottare la strategia che si ritiene migliore per poter fare più punti possibili, variandola durante il gioco in base alle carte che capitano in mano.
Rigiocabilità praticamente infinita.
Molto consigliato per i neofiti

Upon intial play it felt like the game played me more than the other way around.  Drafting seemed to leave mostly obvious or unimportant choices.  Maybe further play will reveal more dynamics than at first impression.

This game takes all the great things about Settlers of Catan, makes it more complicated, but makes the game player faster.  The most unique feature of this game is that all players take their turn at the same time.  This game is fun and FAST!  The strategy will twist your brain into a knot.  The game play is different ever time.  I have never seen another game where everyone takes their turn simultaneously.  Brilliant!

I am a big fan of the meaty economic games and this is pretty far removed from that which makes it so odd that I would choose this game as my 2010 game of the year. No game scales as well as this one because no matter how many players there are it is essentially a 3 player game at most. Even though you really only have 1 decision to make that decision has a lot of ramifications. This takes the draft mechanic a step higher.

Short, but satisfying civ-lite engine building based upon a drafting mechanic.  Great with 3 - 6.  2-player game is fine for those days when you want to play, but don't have any other bodies, but it certainly is not ideal.  High replayability due to varied victory paths.  Some surprise endings - very competitive, regardless of skill level (thus far).

RATING: 6
A light, gateway game that is fun if you don't take it too seriously.  Civ building by selecting a card from a hand, and then passing the hand along. 

A good game for a larger number of players.

There is enough here to keep a board gamer interested, but not so much that a casual player would be overwhelmed.  You can learn this as you play.

The only part of the game that could be confusing to someone new is the scoring (you score on several different categories).  That and you cannot really keep track of or impact players that are not next to you.

While entertaining, you will not really feel like you have built a civ or a story....Zzzzzz....  see TtA for that.

9/2011 First of all: This game takes just as long with 2 as with 7 players; the 7-player ability is a great bonus!
First game was a lot of fun; the following games felt more like solitare.  Is it just another multi-player card game, or is there something more? Will certainly play again.  Looking forward to see if the expansion makes a better game.

Very difficult to rate this game. The mechanism is a bit difficult for beginners, yet there's not enough meat for geeks.

Wow!!  I have been pleasantly surprised with this game.  Often times, when something gets so much hype, you play it and go, "meh".  Not with 7 Wonders.  I have only played it a handful of times so far, but with its short play time and so many options available, I can't wait to get it to the table again.  Finally, something that everyone in our game group actually enjoys!!

Now I'll have to "patiently" wait for the Leaders expansion...

RATING: 7
It's good, but perhaps over-hyped. It's entertaining enough while you're playing, and quick enough to give sufficient reward for your time, but I suspect it is quite possible to play 'optimally' from your available choices and lose by a reasonable margin due to the vaguaries of your positioning re neighbours and their choices, hand order etc - frustrating if you're the competitive sort, but acceptable in such a quick game. I do think there are better choices out there in this category though, perhaps Augustus, for example.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Best game that can accomodate a group up to 7: fast game play (30-40 min.) and everyone plays every turn so little down time.  It's easy to learn the game but with experience the complexity comes in your selection of a strategy.  Only negative is a big variable is how well your neighbors build resources.

Nice little civ game that plays quickly and play time that is not sensitive to the number of players since the main game mechanic with passing and picking cards goes as quickly with 2 as with 7 players (similar to ex Fairy tale). This also lead to almost no downtime in the game. 

It seem to be well balancend (to early to tell with only a few games played) between special ablilities among the wonders. Plente of different strategies to choose for victory and so far high replayabillity. I will most certainly hit the table several times as a filler even tho the feeling of it is more of a 'real' game.

This is a gorgeous looking game; the cards are probably bigger than they need to be for functionality, but the great artwork justifies this.

I like that this game plays well with the full range of players, and this is all thanks to simultaneous play, and the fact that only your immediate neighbours impact your game directly. 

Depending on how the cards fall, at times there's not a lot of interesting decision making involved; it's hard to form a strategy in the early game, because you have no idea what guilds will come out in the final age, and in the final age, it's often just a matter of choosing from among the cards you can play which one will score the most points. This is therefore definitely a lighter game, however it is not a luck-fest; the game rewards careful play, and in our group there are one or two who regularly do better than others.

I don't know what it is about 7 Wonders that I don't like, but given the choice between playing it and something else  (that I don't rank 5 or less) I would always pick something else.  It's probably the multiplayer solitaire feel of it, the low level of interaction among players, or the feel that the game plays you rather than you playing the game.  I have now played it multiple times (more than the ones reported on BGG) with the Wonder Pack expansion, and decided that I do not wish to play it again unless to please others and be in good company.

Crear una  civilización con recursos proporcionados por las cartas que se sacan al azar es el objetivo de este juego. Se requiere de algo de  estrategia y suerte con las manos que le tocan en cada ronda. Es fácil jugarlo con solo dos personas..El diseño es bueno, pero la calidad de las cartas deja mucho que desear. El juego se basa en pasar cartas todo el tiempo lo que garantiza un desgaste acelerado. Por esta razón a mi copia le conseguí forros de plástico. Algunos puede pensar que es difícil a la hora de mezclar las cartas...Pero no lo es ..y si  aseguro juego para largo.

7 Wonders is wonderful for handling 7 players so well.  However, I've taught many people this game and it consistently fails to have impact.  I'll explain the rules, Play a game and no one wants to play again.  Mechanically it's very interesting, but it just fails to connect so often.  Eventually I found that Between Two Cities is a better game for high player counts, it's less complicated to explain and has more interaction between the players.

7 Wonders is a great game, particularly as a gateway. It is a drafting game with simultaneous card play so that games are quick no matter the number of players. Because of this and its low complexity, this is a good game to start or end sessions with. It's good for building up one's playing area, while still interacting with one's neighbors, either through trading, military, and guilds. It offers multiple routes to gain victory points so as to not become too stale. 

Though a good game, I am burnt out from playing it so much. I haven't tried any expansions, but maybe they could breathe life back into it for me.

RATING: 7
This is the game you would get if you mixed Citadels with Glory to Rome. It seems to scale quite well -- we've played with every number of players allowed. It is relatively quick to learn, everyone had a good handle on it after one play. (There are a lot of symbols, but they are easy and relatively intuitive.) It plays quickly too. The cards are thin and seem they would damage easily -- you need sleeves if the game will see the table regularly. There are supposed to be 7 expansions eventually, but I think that would definitely ruin the game. (We found the expansion symbols are not as intuitive as with the base game.) We have all of the expansions for it so far, but only Cities gets used much. (We don't tend to like expansions that change the flow of a game.) All in all, I'd recommend this game as a "must" for any collection, but expansions aren't necessary to enjoy the game. Nothing else plays quite like it and the high player count (that actually WORKS) makes it even more unique.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's amazing how different it plays with 3 people and with 7. Great game, relatively simple and can be used as a gateway game for people who aren't really gamers. A good option for a larger group. It's nice that you can play pretty well just paying attention to your immediate neighbors, but that there is some mild advantage to be had from paying attention to the whole table.

This game has seen more play out of every other game in my collection, bar none.

A decent game that works fine for two players.  Some people even say it's best with two players, because the dummy player creates new opportunities for strategy.  I love the ancient civilization theme.

I'm really enjoying 7 Wonders.  It plays quickly, and despite having 7 different types of cards, play is pretty intuitive (at least on side A).  This has become a staple of our game group, and one we pull out to teach to friends when they drop by.

RATING: 9.5
I really like the simplicity and depth of this one, plus it's great that the number of players doesn't slow the game down.  There are so few games that can even play 7 players, and it's still quick and fun anywhere from 3-7 (I haven't played 2 yet).

RATING: 5
I don't really know why, but I just don't like this game. Is it the cards, the shallowness, the lack of options, the solitaire nature of the game, not seeing how you are doing as opposed to the rest, the lack of interaction, except passing a bunch of cards to your left neighbor. I really don't know, but this successful game doesn't feel very successful to me.

Maybe it is the fact, that during this game, you not once look your opponent into the eye and there is no time for socializing.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Probably better described as a heavier Fairy Tale than a lighter Civilization, 7 Wonders sports a lot of smart decisions – a hassle-free resource and trading system, limiting interactions to your direct neighbours, borrowing the no-money-down building chains from Attika and, finally, putting the whole thing through three well-differentiated stages.

The 30 min playing time causes a strong urge to have another go directly, and the only niggling doubt I currently have is whether the strictly limited pool of playing cards (with only the guilds as a dynamic element) might impact the urge to have another go in a couple of months. On the other hand, we’ve only touched on the potential depth that could come from trying to throw a wrench into your opponent’s plans as much as developing your own, and with increased interaction like that, the replayability would increase strongly.

***UPDATE*** 11-2-11 - Played it two player and enjoyed it very much. Thanks Donovan.


[b]First impression of the game?[/b]
Feels like Dominion or Race for the Galaxy. I'm glad I got to try it. After a first play, I'm not eager to run out and buy it.

[b]What are the highlights?[/b]
I like the interactivity between neighboring players. The card passing mechanic is cool but the change in direction seems arbitrary. The graphic design of the cards is beautiful and well thought out.

[b]What are the drawbacks?[/b]
There is a lot of iconography that I'm sure once you've played it enough, you would get the hang of. The game play seems a bit simplistic and flat.

[b]Who would enjoy this game?[/b]
Gamers who enjoy Dominion will dig this. I just don't see it having the expandability of a game like Dominion.

[b]Who would [i]not[/i] enjoy this game?[/b]
I think this game is pretty hyped right now. Hardcore gamers, if smitten at all, will lose interest quickly.

[b]Would you play this game again?[/b]
I would give it another go...the group I played with seemed underwhelmed and confused by some of the mechanics, so I don't feel I got an accurate feel for the gameplay. As these types of games go, I would rather play Race for the Galaxy, San Juan or Dominion.

7 Wonders was the third official entry and was purchased after the wife and I played it at one of those infamous game nights where the Uber-Nerds showed up with their duffel bags of board games.

This is a fantastic game and will always be one of my favorites - there's plenty of strategy, but the gameplay is fast-paced.  The theme is really engaging and the components really reflect that with gorgeous in game art.  It's also really accessible to new players - although they likely won't truly get until after they've played a couple of hands, but no matter since 7 Wonders is short enough that you can play multiple games quickly.

It's an ok drafting game. Nothing to offend anyone here, but no real excitement either (save the art on the baths card)  I am surprised by the high rank of this game (11). There really isn't much here, pick a card and hope you get passed stuff you can use later. Sure grandma, and the neighbors cat can play, but personally I like a little more meat in a game.

Easily an 8. The game is shockingly, stupidly simple in play (take a card and pass the rest, done), but offers a huge variety of option and opportunity for building and victory. A huge amount of fun and strategy is packed into a remarkable designed and superbly balanced game.

Raising my score to a 10. Played 2-player variant. This game is just so beautifully designed. Incredibly simple to play, yet there is so much going on you just can’t keep track, but it never feels overwhelming. Possibly the most perfectly designed game ever.

Great card game. You must choose between play a card for yourself or a card to rest points to your neighbour. 

Edit: This is the game that we play most with cities and leaders the game gets a lot of extra stuff. However, I'm starting to understand the critics from other people. I don't know what to do to win this game. It seems pure chance. Yesterday a guy who barely knew what he was doing won. Still I keep the score 8.5. I enjoy this game and wanting to try Babel expansion.

A very good game in which you actually build and improve your civilization.

The mechanisms link to the theme, as I really feel I'm a building a civilization when playing.

Plus, the playtime is only about 40 minutes or so, which gives it a great flexibility.

Its only flaw is that it could provide a little more interaction between the players. For some people, this only (minor) flaw kills the game.

At first it seems a little chaotic and random, but after some plays it starts to make sense.
It is very essential for the strategy you follow which Wonder you have and which Wonder the players on your left and on your right have. You should always pay attention to the cards the other players play, but this is easier said than done. For the amount of time you have to spend, this is a realy deep game.

Extremely well crafted game mechanic that fuses both luck and strategy into it. Each turn, players not only have to decide which area to develop, they also have to observe neighboring players to see if they could benefit from them or hinder their progress. Whether the players invest in the present or the future depends on the opportunities presented to them on that particular turn. This makes the game fun and exciting every turn. And the game plays fast (about 30 - 40 minutes) even when there are 7 players. Highly recommended.

This plays so fast regardless of how many people are playing. That's so rare. My husband liked this enough that, after we played it with friends, we had to get our own copy.

We happen to like the two-player variant. It adds an additional layer of strategy as you have to take turns controlling the third city.

Mi parte favorita de 7 wonders es que lo pueden jugar hasta siete jugadores y el tiempo dedicado no se incrementa. También me gusta mucho el tema, pues aunque no es muy profundo, ayuda a que los nuevos jugadores se interesen; es bueno decir que vas a construir tal o cual edificio para que haya un sentimiento de satisfacción. Es bastante sencillo, aunque la falta de texto en las cartas hace que las referencias a las instrucciones sean constantes (al menos en la primera jugada).

I enjoy this game and it's great for larger groups, and it works well for relatively new gamers.  Drafting means minimum downtime even at higher player counts.

Very nice game - among the hottest from SPIEL 2010!

A quick card game that fits a space between pure fillers and games with more dedication. It has strategy, randomness, a little interaction... 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
On one playthrough, this was a 7; after a second, it's an 8. This is a really good game, worthy of its hype.

The drafting mechanic is fantastic, the cards are gorgeous, and the play time is so brief that it has a Dominion-like "Let's play again!" factor to it. The fact that it scales smoothly up to seven is pretty amazing.

The symbols on the cards, as well as the big flowchart in the rulebook, make this look much more intimidating than it is. I won my first game -- a serious rarity! -- against two players who'd played before, which tells me that it's easy to pick up and would probably be a nice gateway for non-gamers.

Between the guilds and the drafting, I can see plenty of replayability in 7 Wonders.

RATING: 9
After 7 plays I now understand why this is popular.  I am a fan of Fairy Tale and this is an improvement.  Still light, still addictive, still fast.  The scoring system is the only 'fiddly' part if you can call it that.  Our 4P games take maybe 20 minutes.  There are some hard choices throughout also.  But, do not expect anything but a fun filler here.

After 30+ plays, this game has a solid staying power for a filler.  It is a solid 9.  I prefer 4p over 3p and soon will get a chance to play 5p.

Rating based on 5/6 players.

Not a bad game by any stretch, but in larger groups you cannot interact with people not next to you (which also gives people a big advantage depending on who they're seated next to), and as the hands are stretched among more people you cannot make educated guess as to what cards will be available when the hand returns to you. Both of these factors make it really hard to do any sort of planning, and I felt like I was just guessing what to do the whole time (and I still managed to come in a strong 2nd both times). I can imagine myself liking this game a lot more with 4 or fewer players.

A great introductory game to its genre. Only things bringing this game down in my ratings are two points: A) The game doesn't involve players beyond the direct neighbors, so player interaction is very limited. B) The game needs more depth to have replay value. 7 Wonders unfortunately will only last some 15-20 plays before it has been played out.

RATING: 4
I like the theme and card-drafting idea, but not my style of game for a couple reasons:
1) The game play results in very little social interaction (e.g. people consider their deck in parallel, looking at the resources of their neighbors, making a choice, passing their deck over, and waiting until everyone's done... then repeat).
2) For large numbers of players (6-7), you have essentially no ability to impact the farthest players. Also, for large numbers of players picking a lesser card to spoil a neighbors strategy is not a winning strategy, since you lose ground to many more players in the meantime (sort of a tragedy of the commons), thus large-player games devolve into multi-player solitaire.
3) The scoring is somewhat convoluted; it is difficult to accurately compute your neighbors' scores (e.g. if you want to determine who you should pay for a resource), which means either operating partly in the dark or else dragging out your turn/increasing dead time for other players.
4) I feel like the key way to become better at this game (after playing 5x, winning 1x, and twice being within 2 points of winner) would be to memorize the distribution of cards so I know exactly what's coming, probability of future free-buildings paying off, etc. That doesn't feel like fun to me.
5) Later on in the game, your path feels mostly-chosen. For instance, if you've been investing in science, you must continue. If you haven't, then you can't switch. So the choices become less and less interesting over time.

Perhaps I had high expectations simply because of its awards and ratings, but I was expecting better. Definitely worth a few plays, but I don't think it was worth owning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
First I have to say, that the game is actually quite good in some ways. Its quick, quite easy to understand, you can even develop some strategy to build your way to victory and if you're good with planning in minutes, with a little bit luck, you'll get what you planned. So why so low rating? Yeah, I have to admit that this game is not for me, basically because its gathering quite lot of things, which I usually don't like on games. First of all it lacks any atmosphere, for me its just counting and counting...as an typical euro game, but in euro game, the counting can get you to victory, because euro usually don't count with luck. So guess what... in 7 wonders, there is a lot of luck. There is possibility that you will or not, get the card you want. You have to always count with choices of people, sitting next to you from both sides. Based on what they already have, how much money they have and so on. And that's the only interaction, you have during the game. Yeah, watching the table of your neighbor. Maybe some trading. That's not good enough for better rate, sorry. I have to admit that it was innovative with pick and pass mechanic.

An easy enough game, though some concepts you may have to be careful with when talking to new players (the fact that you don't use up resources seems to confuse quite a few people).

We played this at BGG con with a new group. Neither Erin nor I had played before. I didn't really "get" the game going in, but by the end of our first play, I feel that I understand it that much better. Part of my difficulty understanding the game was due to the explanation I received. Sometimes it's hard to learn a new game at a convention, however simple the game may be, and this was no exception. It's interesting how all you do is draft. I like the variety of options, and feel it plays well with 6-7. I'm glad I own it, but I'm not sure how often it will get played.

3 / 5 - Good

Alarm bells have to start ringing when I can walk up to a table with 4 experienced players, learn the game, and beat them on my first play. But it's engaging enough and the card-drafting mechanic is addictive and under-utilised generally. It gives one a deliciously warm glow inside to remove a card from the deck that you know the player next in line wants desperately before passing on the deck :)

RATING: 7
Overwhelming when played for the first time. Many paths to victory. Player interaction is minimal and indirect, but better than Dominion in this regard. Player boards and cards can really clutter a table. Important to make sure all players are playing at the same pace, as it is easy to "play ahead."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.58
Rating:

Game quality: It's better than Settlers of Catan due to the lack of randomness, and that's about it. Just a number of things going on for a decently done mechanically nice horse and pony show, but it never felt engaging or dynamic on the level you would think one of the big named games would be. No clue how I feel about card drafting. It kind of felt awkward but more plays are needed.

It's a lot to take in for a new player. I'm still not sure how important certain aspects were. It was a quick run through of the rules and we went. 7.

Would I buy this again if I was starting over: No game gets the "Should I buy this or not" treatment more than this game and thus it is a perfect candidate for a 5. 5.

Do I want to play this if asked: Maybe not long term but certainly at least one more play. A game I judged early and now looking back I think I would view it as being higher, but I don't know until further plays cement it either way. 8.

Overall: 7.58.

Rating Potential: I don't see it going down unless I decide it isn't worth the purchase. Gut feeling tells me it might be worth it. I have a feeling this goes higher and becomes one of the few games that went up over time in part because I changed as a gamer.

Keeping the rating for now after a second play. My issue so far is that I have been taught it via a Con so in the spirit of time saving, rules have been missed. Add in playing it two years apart and  I can never get a real good grip on the game. Still a five for the willing to buy it if I was starting over, but I'm leaning on this being a no. My guess is Lewis and Clark officially kills this.

Ordered Nov 8th 2010
Received Dec 8th 2010

I really can't say enough good things about this game.  It plays in about the same amount of time with 7 as it does with 3. With a couple of new players in the mix you'll play about an hour and with seasoned players, about 30-45 minutes. 

7 Wonders is definitely a "gateway" game. It's light, that is, not overly thinky; chess it is not! However, there are plenty of agonizing decisions to make and plenty of ways to screw up your own plans as well as those plans of the people playing to your left and your right.

New players may need some help on their first game; there are a lot of details to go through but after one game, I've yet to see even non-gamers not "get it".  It might feel a bit overwhelming the first time but the second and third time, you'll get it. Kids seem to like it too (great family game) with younger ones teaming up with an adult to make those fun decisions to deny dad those cards he really needs! :-)

Got it for Christmas and have played 8 games so far.

The game plays very fast which means you are constantly making decisions on which cards will help you the most and which to keep away from your opponents.

The drafting mechanic coupled with the ease of using resources and not having to keep track of a bunch of tokens just makes this game gold.

I'm dying to get a 7 player game in.  So far I have only played with 3 and 4 players.

Update: After 13 games I rate it an 8. Leaders and Cities add a lot to the game.

Played 10-15 times.

I rate it a 7 after three plays. Rating will probably go up after a couple more plays when I know the cards and know what to expect in each era. The game scores high for being quick and for accomodating seven players. A very useful game to have in your collection.

My *only* complaint with this game is that it's hard to put together a strategy. Often what seems like a good idea is trumped by someone else doing something trivial.

A really mediocre game. In my PERSONAL OPINION (don't start PM'ing me saying that it's just my opinion, because it is), this game is really overrated - all you do is collect cards in turns, almost no interaction between players, just people sitting together doing whatever each wants to do. If you want to play a civilization control game, try Through The Ages: A New Story of Civilization. Yes, this game is shorter and easier but again, there are other way more fun medium-duration games than this (for example Citadels would be a comparable game to this one and way more enjoyable, forcing intrigues, bluffing, teamwork)

Simultaneous drafting makes this game great choice for even 5+ players unlike most games. Good with less than that too of course. The artwork is pretty good too. Replayability is pretty good, especially with Leaders expansion. It's a surprisingly dry game for a Bauza game once you've grown familiar with it, but even then it's pretty quick and never boring.

2-Player Comment:
*7 Wonders has built-in variant, which is pretty intrusive neutral player. It's bit dull to manage it every second turn. I disagree with BGG "Not recommended" though, 7 Wonders is decent game for two, but it shines with 3+.

Fun drafting game. For some reason many people in my groups don't like this game but I don't really understand why. I'm usually up for playing it but I really don't like playing with new people. I just don't have the patience any longer to explain everything several times because people don't get it. I always tell people there's more strategy to it than only looking at what your two immediate neighbors are doing.

I know a lot of people like that you can play this with up to 7 and not increase the play time, my preference is not to play with 4 max.  With 5-7 players, I feel like you're playing a different game than most of the table.

Initially rated it a 7.5.  Now, with several play sessions under my belt, I am enjoying it more and more.  Easy enough for my 7 year old nephew to play, but strategic enough that most of the adults will finish the game with a higher score than him!  Fun game for a bigger group.

RATING: 8.5
Civilisation building by way of card drafting from communal hands of cards, and ancient wonder construction.

When I initially played this game I was new to the hobby and wasn't so sure about it.  There is some initial iconography to get used to, and some scoring quirks to understand.

Further plays and experience in the hobby really changed my mind.  This game scales incredibly well, plays quickly, and has a range of different strategies available.  Once learned, the rules are pretty straightforward and I would see this as suitable for family play.

There is interaction with one's neighbours via military (rather than declaring an attack, this is automatically resolved at the end of each era based on relative military strength) and all others by what cards you leave in each hand as it makes its way around the table. 

Great looking artwork, although the cards aren't particularly sturdy so I recommend sleeving them.

One's ability to win at this game will really depend on how alert one's opponents are and who they are paying attention to. 

Can be a bit chaotic with more than 4 players, particularly if someone gets out of order with the simultaneous action cycle.  There is an official 2 player variant which comes with the game (even though it is listed as being for 3-7 players).

Not the deepest game going around, but it doesn't try to be.  What it does in the time it takes, it does really well - a really great game.  After many plays, I am still keen to keep playing, although after a dozen plays I was keen to start adding expansions.

Jópofa játék. Az első játék alkalmával nem nyűgözött le, a következőkben egyre jobban tetszett, aztán megint kevésbé. Úgy érzem, hiába vezet mindig más út a győzelemhez, minden játék egy kaptafára megy, ráadásul az ember hajlamos csak magára figyelni játék közben, ami számomra negatívum. Ettől függetlenül néha szívesen játszom vele.

There are certain games I feel like I ought to like, but I don't.  This is one such game.

The good news is that it's a quick, easy to play, game, that moves quickly.

I just didn't feel very involved while playing this game.  Most of my decisions were dictated by the contents of my hand, as opposed to being real, strategic decisions.  The theme seemed to play very little role in the game at all.

A lot of people seemed to like it, but it just didn't get me engaged in it.

7 Wonders is an evergreen game. It will always sell a ton of copies per year and that's because of it's accessibility. Drafting is one of the simplest mechanics to explain/teach in modern board gaming. Take a card, pass to the left, take a card, pass to the left. That's where this game falls short for me. It does nothing unique or special. Even the theme is rather weak. Theme is not integrated into the mechanics at all, and for that very reason, any theme could be pasted over the mechanics and it would be like nothing changed. Wanna use resources to build parts of a space station? How about layers of a cake? It all works the same, so theme is kind of nonexistent. I never felt like I was building my wonder. Hell, half the time I forget what wonder I'm even playing.

It's not a bad game. It sells well because it is a solid drafting game that is so accessible. The light weight of the game makes it simple for new players to grasp onto, but the decisions that you make aren't exactly deep and complex. Just take a card. Nothing that you take is bad for you. I'm rating it a 7 because I'll play it, but my heavier-gaming preferences yearns for something with a little more depth.

Everybody agreed that this is nothing special after playing it once. Autistic gameplay, one builds up a set of cards while only interacting with the left and right neighbour. And it depends strongly on luck. But after some months it turned out that it is the game we played most often. Because it is accessible, flexible with a player number from 3 to 7, and it does not take very long to finish. And it is good fun. So I have to give it a better rating than I originally thought I would.

This game fits right in my wheelhouse.  Plays with 2-7 people equally well, so I can play it with my husband or a whole group.  Only lasts about 45 min, requires some strategy but is not too heavy.

Mechanically interesting how resources are shared via drafting and simultaneous play, with room to sabotage your opponents. Whilst others in my group adore it I can't help but feel the game is too abstract, I don't ever feel like I'm doing anything just collecting some cards. The scoring seems quite arbitrary with how it's calculated, for me only adding to make the game more abstract.

Such a great game, with several qualities that make it a top choice to come off the shelf. It supports up to seven players - frequently a necessity. Everyone plays simultaneously - awesome, we don't have to wait a half hour for each turn. And it's just cards, so we don't have to spend a half hour setting up a board and lots of tokens and whatnot. It's ease of setup, speed of play, and support of many people make it the best choice a lot of the time.

Not much interaction. Had 6 players playing, 3 were new to the game including myself. I didn't really know what I was doing during the whole game - just wanted it to end. I won the game and the other 3 players who knew what they were doing actually came in last. The two players beside me: one that knew the game very well(last place) and the other new to the game like me(3rd place). I won without knowing much - that says a lot about the strategy. I don't understand why this game is so highly-rated.

I've only played this a few times as 2 player game with my wife, but each time was enjoyable. This game is beautiful, with great components, great replayability due to the unique wonders and cards, and short (so you can play several games in a row, or several other games in an evening), and scales well for 2 - 7 players. I actually wish the game lasted a bit longer so players can set up more of the really sweet card combinations, but like RftG, part of the experience is time pressure. So far, an excellent game.

*update* played several 3 and 4 player games and enjoyed each game. Not much difference between 2-4 player games. fun, quick, and light.

Interesting Drafting Game (you have a hand of cards, equal to the number of players, and you take a card and pass the rest on)

Each card you draft will be played on the turn you draft it, and can give you bonuses, and more ways to buy upgrades.  It's important to maintain balance, but also to specialize a little.  Your neighbors will effect you the most directly, and at the end of each round of drafting, there will be the opportunity for some bonus points.  

I really enjoy this game.  It's fairly simple, and not particularly hard to learn.  Each "Wonder" has a different play style and strategy.  I strongly encourage playing this multiple times, and with 7 players!

Excellent game. Played 2 times the 2 player variant, 1 time with 4 players. I loved all plays even if I had to explain everything. Beautiful art and nice theme and above all (I play games most with 'non-gamers') short gameplay. Some even want to play again and again (as I do). Multiple ways to score points and multiple opportunities to change tactics. Even if you lose there is a sense of winning because you have built your own goals/city/wonder!

I also managed to "sell" this game to friends and family: it's really accessible (just after the 'symbol-hurdle') and it plays with 2-7 players.

I have the game for quite a while now and still play it with everybody and with the Cities expansion it's highly replayable.

It's a tactical game overall, with luck but also a layer of strategy and certanly more interaction between players than many other eurogames. It has some of the best artworks ever and brings a pretty fun and fast experience almost every time (despite setup can be long). Expansions are a must since the game lacks variety after several plays.

I will track at this entry all my plays of 7 wonders + Expansions.

The basic idea is simple but the sheer variety of cards and the different card-based mechanics in play make the game a bit daunting for non-gamers. For gamers the small amount of strategy involved doesn't seem worth the effort of playing the game. So the game feels like it's in no man's land--too complicated for non-gamers and not meaty enough for gamers. Will revisit the game with expansions.

The lack of interaction and strategy ruins this game for me. The gameplay is completely reactionary and you can barely influence what happens to other players, except those next to you (and even then its very limited).

Your options usually are extremely limited and the hands basically play themselves. 

This game boils down to sitting at the table, and watching someone run away and win. Sometimes its you, sometimes its not. Not too much you can do about it really.

Not my type of game.

I don't usually like deck building games, but this isn't too torturous. I think the feel of building up your city really improves what would otherwise be just a "get good cards and hope they all work together" game. Once everyone is familiar with the game, it becomes more like a multi-player solitaire. Strategy is pretty limited and so far, those with the most blue cards wins. However, it plays quickly and is easy to learn. If this was a meatier game (it's a filler) I'd probably rate it a 6. But it plays fast and is worth the time investment. Edit: Just downgraded to a 6. Played Olympos tonight and it is a much more successful "civ" game than 7 wonders in the same amount of time. I can see 7 Wonders appeal, just for some reason, I'm not a huge fan (I think I just do not like drafting/deck building card games). However, still worth a look!

7 Wonders is a fantastic empire building game in which players attempt to build resource-generating assets and use those assets to purchase various improvements to their empires.  Some assets focus on scientific progress, military might, economic gains, or just straight victory points.  Players can also construct various stages of their chosen wonder (e.g. great pyramids, hanging gardens, etc) that provide them with various bonuses.

The game uses a nifty hand rotation mechanism in which players switch hands in a clockwise or counterclockwise manner each turn.  As such, players must balance choosing the best card for themselves each round with preventing their neighbors from accessing beneficial cards from a given hand.

I have now played this game 5 times and 4 times within the last 2 months.  I don't necessarily see the balance in this game or why it's rated so highly.  The player interaction is extremely low and you have very little if any effect on players who aren't your neighbors unless you play what is called a "screw you" card.  At that point all you can do is take it.  The most interaction I have had with other players in the game is when someone asks, "Is everyone ready to play your card?"  If you're into card games like Magic & Pokémon, I can see why you might like it.  However, this game is not for me.

After being forced to play this awful game again, I have lowered my rating from a 4 to a 3.  (5/10/2017)

After being forced and berated during another play of this, it's now down to a 2.  (11/8/2017)  After this last play, I did some research on this game and found out that the base game is ok.  It's the Cities expansion that kills this game for me.  Since then I've informed my gaming group I'll play 7 Wonders, but without the Cities expansion.  We haven't played it since because they don't want to remove the expansion out of the game.

After two more plays of just the base game, I like this much better without the expansion.  However, it still suffers from not being able to get cards you're after.  I understand this is probably one of those games where you have to play what's given to you, but you cannot determine that until probably halfway through the game.  I have raised my rating to a 5, but it'll probably stay here and not raise any higher.

Based off a handful of 3-player games.  Thought the game was great, but not necessarily deserving of it's hype.  It does offer some decent strategy for a quick game that plays larger groups.  I'd much rather play this with 6 than some party game..

Update:
After playing the game with more, I've actually found that I really only enjoy it with 4, maybe 5 at most.  Even then, it's just an okay game.  I'll play it, and even bring it out in certain situations, but it'll never be the highlight of a given night...

Wonderful game.  Well balanced with continual interesting decisions, although a moderate learning curve and the neighbour-only interaction means a weak player can really heavily favour their neighbours.  My main criticism is the scoring, and set-up/pack-up feels much too slow and tedious, which takes a little away from the game.  Playing on tablets would be an ideal experience!

And while the simultaneous selection makes the game fast, it doesn't seem to encourage much table-talk which is unfortunate. However, I still really enjoy the game.

This is one of the few games that is good for a large group of 6+ players.  It is light and plays quickly, but still has some strategic decisions.  The one thing I don't like is that it is very difficult to influence players other than the two directly to your right or left.

06/21/11 Played a five-player game. For a relatively short game there are several strategies that can be used.  I agree with many on BGG that say it is over priced for what you get (8 player mats, some cardboard tokens, and three decks of cards). To me that shouldn't cost $50 retail. The art work is nice. But its not $50 "nice", as those cards are *very* thin. Its a good thing the owner sleeved them (which is yet another expense). I look forward to playing it again.

OK filler. I am afraid the lastability is going to be big issue. Too soon you have seen all the cards and combinations and that eats the fun out of game rapidly.

I think 7 Wonders is a bit overrated or maybe it got hyped too much, I don't know.
Don't get me wrong, the game is not that bad. But it is, for what it is, too simple. The draft mechanism is (almost) the hole game. The decisions are not that game changing. There are multiple ways to score points and if you did not get the cards you wanted you try to collect other types of cards. In this regard 7 Wonders lacks on depth. Therefore I like the Leaders expanion, which gives the player more direction from the very begining. So it gets more focused on an entire strategy.
Maybe I should also take a look into the Cities expansion.

Anyway I would rather play a fast game of Sushi Go with a similar game experience.

Not as good as 7wD, which is the ultimate 7 Wonders for me, but nonetheless i enjoy this game, which is a simple drafting game and has more depth to it then one might think. I seem to be the only one who likes this though :) 
For me on the same level as Splendor, easy to get to the table, easy to explain, easy to play, Splendor for the setcollecting and 7w for the drafting (while still having some setcollecting).

7 wonders is a great great game. One of my favorite game ever. The theme is awesome, the mechanic is quick, easy and just great. You really feal like you build your civilization when you play a card.

RATING: 9
Played this game with 2,3,4,5,6 and 7 players.  Enjoyed this the most with at least 4 players.  Hardly any time commitment per game once you're used to the different icons.  We sometimes sit down for a quick game then find ourselves playing it 8-10 times.  It's addictive because you find yourself thinking that you'll do better next time.

As you get familiarized with the different cards, you may find yourself flying too quickly during the draft.  You definitely have to take time after each selection to see what ALL your opponents are doing... not just your neighbors.  Counter-drafting is a key aspect of the game that can lead to resource denial and other strategies.

Although easy to learn, having experienced players playing is when this game will shine.  We've found that beginners tend to skew the game in favor of their immediate neighbors.  Multiple beginners lead to solitaire-type play where they just concentrate on whatever is in front of them.  This can sometimes lead to runaway victories.  The best way we've mitigated this is by teaching beginners basic drafting strategies while we teach them the game itself.  It's easier to do this during a sample game that goes through at least Age II. And remind them that there are no resource cards in Age III.

That being said, once all players are well versed with the cards and the different basic strategies, then the games become much more competitive and balanced.  We've had margins of victory as little as 1 or 2 multiple times.

This is a terrific game with tons of replay value.  Sleeves are a must.

Great, great game.  It was a pleasure to discover and so fast you want to play another one right after.  It's a keeper and a game everyone should play at least once.

A huge bonus is that it plays as well with 7 players compare to when you play it with 3 players.

Thumbs UP!

It's not a bad diversion, but it's not a Civ-building experience, no matter what anyone says. I think Military, with its ability to score twice, once each for the players to your left and right, is, overall, too powerful.

The artwork is lovely and the mechanisms are nice and simple. I like it, but I am not gripped by it.

07-2012 - finally got a chance to play this one for the first time and got to see what the hype was about. Overall, I found it enjoyable and liked all the different options and paths (always a winning formula for me with any game - give me more than one way to win, and I'll like it). While I'm not sure I'd suggest it at this point if it was in a pile of games to potentially be played and it was my call, I'd like/love to play it if that's what the group elects to play.

Uses a form of community card drafting that allows everyone to see what's available (also found in Notre Dame & Citadels).  This allows a form of blocking opponents by choosing a card before they have the chance to even see it, depending on turn order.

Plays quickly no matter how many are playing, though interaction tends to be with your right & left, any influence on the other side of the table in large games in indirect at best. So it's one of those 3 player games where you can finish worse than 3rd.

As with all drafting games, some will instantly know what to do & keep the game going too fast for those who want to study the cards in minute detail. Some medium is required to keep order, but that's OK.

Mildly intriguing card-drafting game with somewhat forced theme. Relatively high degree of player interaction for a euro-mechanics game with card drafting and taking neighbours into consideration when making plays.

It is passably entertaining at up to four players. With more than that--I played an eight-plater session once--nudges it increasingly further toward an un-overseeable mess where you have no idea of who does what or where you are in the race.

My weekly group reacted very enthusiastically about this game. They demanded another play after the first one, and another.

Remarkably fast game, nice artwork.

Thanks to the changing hands of cards and buying stuff from your neighbours it's a lot more interactive than something like race for the galaxy.

Got bored with it after 12 plays. Haven't touched it since 2012 and rather play something else.

Not a bad game for a large group.  Because the play is simultaneous it's nearly as fast with seven as it is with three.

It's pretty simple and despite some gorgeous artwork isn't all that thematic.

I really enjoy the drafting mechanism.  I also like the aspect of just being able to buy from your immediate neighbors, which makes the available resources very different for each player in a larger group.  Along with the fairly quick play time, multiple available point strategies, and scalability up to 7 players, this has become a great choice for lunch games at work.  Totaling points at the end becomes a bit cumbersome, but not enough to hurt the game overall (and would probably be easier if we actually used the included pads).

I feel like this should be light enough for a gateway game, but it is not.  While experienced gamers should pick this up with one quick explanation, newer gamers will have a hard time remembering all of the symbols, and have a hard time grasping the science scoring.  Still a wonderful game, that plays up to 7 in a world of 2-4 player board games. A quick game that plays up to 7 and is quick , around 30 mins, makes this a must have imo.

Plays really fast and there are some interesting decisions to make based on the cards you see. This might be too early to say for sure but it feels like sometimes you are hamstrung by not getting enough resource cards passed to you. Very good game especially with the length of time it plays in!

You just can't go wrong with 7 Wonders. Whenever I have game board newbies at the table, or even veterans, I'm always going to pick this up as a recommended play option.

Perfectly harmless. Mild amusement can be found in this, and if played rapidly it's a fine pastime. That said, unless I'm having 6 or 7 players who are low on time or low on interest in longer games or more "party" style games I don't see myself choosing this. Not hard to learn, symbols are simple with a few exceptions that need to be handled on a case by case basis, you feel you have some agency (though I doubt the extent of it at least for higher counts), you make something then you score it and ta-da. I can see the popularity in the same way I see it for Ticket to Ride. Not quite my preference.

Game in a Nutshell: Draft cards that build up your civilization. Some cards give you available resources while other need resources to build.

Played as: 2,4,5,7 player

Played with: Vanilla (2,4,5,7); Leaders exp. (5 player)

Pros: Nice, quick, medium-light game that does a good job of giving you a sense you're building something. Simultaneous drafting frees the game up to potentially move as fast with 3 people as with 7. That also means there's minimal downtime. Has a natural flow to it. Nice big cards with colorful artwork. A nice change of pace from some other games built on an overused mechanic.

Cons: A lot of iconography that isn't very explanatory on it's own. A little explanation text on the cards couldn't have hurt. Kind of a messy game when things start getting stacked up. Because of that, it has a learning curve to it that's slightly beyond the weight of the game. 

Other: I think this game has a place in just about every collection for it's unique way of allowing up to 7 people to be making meaningful decisions without interruption through the course of an entire game. I still can't think of another that does this on an individual level.

Best Use: A "heavy" filler.

I unboxed this and overall the components are nice. I love the larger sized cards. My only beef so far is the quality of the cards themselves. Just looking through them and I saw the edges fraying. The stock is decent, but the edges will show wear in one game. The printing quality is not up to par for me. In a card-based game, the cards should be higher quality. The rulebook is clear, although it has a few mistakes (nothing impacting game play). The game plays quick and is full of decisions (more so than you would expect, given the basic mechanics). It is easy to get several games in with 4-5 people in about an hour.

This game is more fun the more people you have. It's a great social game - it plays quickly and it is light enough to allow for casual conversation at the same time.

I enjoy figuring out the best strategy to take based on the cards that I have to choose from, especially since I've seen almost every strategy win if executed well. There is no one path to victory, but at the same time it doesn't leave the options so open-ended to create massive AP.

The game is kind of low in depth. To really get a satisfying tactical interaction with the other players requires them to have substantial play experience. Definitely would rather play Seasons if we have 4 or less people. (I rather enjoyed a game I just played with some very experienced players, so this might be worth another go) Nov 2013 Update: With Cities Expansion, this has become worth playing in my mind.

Not so difficult to introduce to non-gamers also thanks to the short playing time (its strong point); even if the group don't understand the game mechanics at first, you can have another round . We love the two players variant, more strategic and less luck/draw dependant.

"Ok- here's how we play.  You get seven cards, and you are going to draft one card each round and pass the deck on."
"Then what?"
"You score."
"Check.  Then?"
"We enter the second age.  You draft some cards."
"And then score?"
"Yep."
"Then?"
"We draft some more cards."
"And score?"
"And score."
"Then the game gets started?"
"Nope, son, that's the whole thing."

Passable lunchtime entertainment.  Like the variable boards.  But how anyone would want to play this 50 times and call it an 'instant classic' is beyond me.  Almost totally solitaire.

I like this game more every time I play it. The last two games have been 58-58-54, and 65-60-59, with all players trying different strategies. It plays quick, has interesting decisions, and doesn't outstay its welcome. I like the game with the Leaders expansion even more!

I have a weird relationship with this game.  I nearly always want to play it, but I don't feel like I'm getting much better at it.  Sometimes a game will end and I won't be sure where I went wrong.  But I know I'd be happy to play it again.

The fact that this game goes to 7 players without too much of an increase in playing time is one of its strengths.  We've also played it a few times with the 2 player variant, and I don't mind it, but there's other games we'd usually choose if there's only two of us.

This is a great game at any player count. Say what you will about the two player variant, but I think it offers tactics not available in a regular game. The gameplay is always quick and offers quite a few paths to victory. There is a good amount of hate drafting which I think goes unnoticed in some drafting games. This, however, does make it frustrating when playing with new people. You do need to pay attention. As far as "solitaire" games go, there's more player interaction than you would initially think. My all-time favorite game and with plenty of expansions, it never gets dull.

A fast, card drafting game with a Civilization-like theme. It doesn't scratch that Civ itch for me but it's a fun game nonetheless!

Great weekday game as it plays quickly, but has a lot of depth.  Lots of strategies are possible and its a pretty game.  Swapping cards gives it a different feel and allows you to block other players from getting certain cards.  A lot going on but easy to teach.  I also enjoy the official 2 player variant, as usually we play our games with two, and with the free city 7 Wonders plays well with 2.

7 wonders is a fast played game. The amount of players doesn't prolong the time it takes to play because everyone does their thing at the same time.

Beginners do several mistakes because they don't understand the rules or don't remember them. There aren't many rules though.. After the first game every player understands the basics of this game but sometimes beginners keep on collecting same named cards which is against the rules.

Wonders are not equal so it makes games very different every time. It's a bother because your wonder makes you inclined to collect certain way those points. Then someone nabs your card right before your turn. I think ruining the game of others is easier than succeeding yourself.

This game is fast, idea is average and it is visually good but doesn't give us the feeling of "awesome!!"... I usually get exited about new game but this doesn't spark us that often. When we take this game out we usually play it a couple of times before forgetting it for a while.

[u]04-Jan-2013[/u]:  This was the first big "hit" for my family after I got into this hobby, and it's still one of Mrs. Mo's favorites.  After the initial learning curve of figuring out all of the different cards and which ones can combo together, this game has been a [i]wonder[/i](Ha!)ful addition to our family game time.  Games are almost always close.  There are several strategies available to gain VP.  The art is great - except for two semi-risque cards that don't seem necessary (Baths and Altar).  And this is just a fun game.

The card drafting mechanism is not unique to the game world, but it is so in my collection.  It's such a tough decision in the early part of each round of which cards to play.  The choices are plentiful.  The resource management is a game in and of itself.  Do I build a bunch of resources and just go for big VP later on or stay minimal with the resources and build cards early that will allow future free buildings (if they come your way).

Lots of good stuff in this game.  Easily one of my favorites for it's variety of scoring, artwork, play length, and scalability.

[u]24-Jan-2014[/u]: Still high on my fave list after all this time.  Plays fast.  Always a close game.

This is a great Euro drafting game that has a legitimate amount of depth, especially with expansions. The game is over far too quickly though, which can be good or bad, but you can always play again. Very good for 3 or more players and scales relatively well, although as with many Euro games the other opponents on the table not immediately beside you barely affect you at all other than maybe screwing your draft, so while you can play with 7, there isn't really much incentive to do so.

RATING: 7.5
A mini civ builder where each player starts with a civilization containing certain powers when they begin building it's wonders.  Players get a hand of 7 cards, play one, pay any building costs and then hand the next 6 cards to the left.  You can interact with the players on the left and right of you by purchasing their resources and in a round by round cold war where the player with the largest army gets points and the player with the lowest loses points.  You continue drafting and passing in this style until there is only one card left which is discarded.

The game is played in three rounds and there are a number of combos, mainly in reduced building costs (build for free if you have this other card, etc.).  For a thirty minute game that plays up to 7 players it's quite effective.

RATING: 9
*Aug 2013*After 3 plays, game gets a 9. I'm curious to see how long the *ahem* wonder lasts, but right now I'm seeing quite a bit of longevity and fun!

If my fondness for this game fades, I'll look into Cities expansion

*Dec 2013* After 24 plays, plus 6 with the Cities expansion, this game is no longer one I am dying to play any longer. 

If setup was simpler, I'd probably break it out more. With 4+ players, game is hands down improved by Cities but with 3p, the base game is perfect and fun as is, even for veterans. 

The game's one con is that it's too complex for what it is to introduce to newbs. The game doesn't present its options well enough to newbs, even with a good rules explanation. So it sits in that weird position where it's a great filler to play with a lot of people.... only setup (especially with Cities) is kinda fiddly (helps if others assist) and everyone needs to have played at least once or twice prior. 

Still, it took quite a few plays for my love affair to fade....... At a low estimate of each game taking 30 minutes (some took longer, such as when intro-ing to newbs), I've gotten 15 hours of play out of it. At least 12 of those were filled with the excitement of loving the heck outta this game. Definitely a worthy buy for most gamers, even if not a permanent keeper.

Lightish card draft-style game that gives a nice, slight Civ flavor.  Grab a card, pass hand to the left, grab another card, pass that hand to the left, etc.  Really fun implementation of some M:tG draft-style stuff (remembering card layouts, aggressive drafting, estimating likelihood of getting what you want, etc).  There's the significant advantage to players who've played before, though.  Advanced play becomes highly specialized down certain paths.

everything works and initial plays probably rival initial plays of dominion/thunderstone.  a bit more decision making than those two, but will have a much shorter initial life.

not really a 'deck making' game and barely a 'drafting' game (in the vein of a MTG draft).

nice production value from Repos again.

A neat game that accommodates up to 7 players. The downside is that drafting interaction becomes almost meaningless once you see less than 3 cards from the initial 7 being passed back to you. The reason: part of the fun is deciding on some fringe cards than are good for you and that you can plan/hope for to make it back to you.

The idea of selling 7 expansions of this makes me regret my buy. I am somewhat of a completionist and the around 17-20 Euros for Leaders or Cities are a disgrace; there is by far not enough content to warrant the money.

RATING: 7
This is a fun drafting game that plays well at all player counts (well, maybe not at 2 players, but now we have 7 Wonders: Duel). The fact that a 3 player game takes just about as long as a 7 player game is probably my favorite thing about the game as I can play it with larger groups, but this can also be seen as its primary problem. Effectively, you are only worried about playing the person to your right and your left while everyone else in the group will not effect you. Also, the symbology can intimidate new players who will the prefer something a little quicker and lighter such as Sushi Go! 

Overall, once you understand the card play, the game is pretty quick and can be fun, but I find there isn't much long term planning when playing at the higher player counts. Also, I prefer heavier games that utilize drafting (like Blood Rage), but I'll keep this game on hand to play with friends who don't like to play the longer, meatier games in my collection, but still want something gamier than a quick filler.

The Eighth Wonder is how this game gets such great buzz on a site that seems to pride itself on how "above" they are on such simplistic, shallow games.  There was nothing new nor novel here.

Este es un gran juego para cuando tienes muchos jugadores y quieren algun juego no muy largo y divertido, ya que pueden jugar 7 jugadores y hasta 8 con la expansion de cities. Me encanta el hecho de que no hay casi tiempo muerto, ya que todos juegan al mismo tiempo con la mecanica del draft, el unico tiempo muerto es cuando algun jugador se atrasa y hay que esperarlo, pero no se pierde mucho. 

Por lo unico que no le pongo el 10 es porque cuando me junto a jugar juegos de mesa normalmente hay gente que prefiere juegos mas sencillos (normalmente las mujeres) y terminamos jugando Dixit o King of tokyo, y cuando me junto solamente con los mas jugones, somos normalmente menos de 4 y preferimos otros juegos para ese numero de jugadores, pero cuando lo llego a jugar con 4 o mas jugadores que nos gusta, se pone muy bueno.

7 Wonders is my go-to game for 5-8 people either with more casual gamers or as an evening starter. Even poor or inattentive players can have a good time without feeling disengaged. Downtime is minimal, you can complete the first game quickly, and shuffle up for another try (the "real" game for the new players). Players can force a different strategy every game or follow the signals of their neighbors. Few games bridge the skill divide so successfully without resorting to heaps of randomness. The expansions add nice variety.

At first I was a little iffy on 7 wonders but the more I have played it the more the game grew on me. Still not my first choice to pull out, even with a bigger group, but it certainly is good for when you want that feeling of accomplishment like you built something in a shorter play time compared to many of the bigger civ games.

Will get significant plays due to the group size it can support and how fast it plays.  Lots of good options to take to win.  Only thing I don't like is that I don't feel connected to the group who are not directly next to me.  Yeah I see what they are doing and can think if they may pass me cards they aren't collecting (green for example) but everyone tends to play with their "heads down" in this one.

RATING: 9
The box, cards, contents, manual and quick reference are all great. The base game is a lot of fun to play. You are constantly passing cards and taking cards. The way the ages are split into three is a great concept, and you'll find yourself flying through the first age and slowing down in the next to the more familiarized you get.

The only trouble we had in the beginning was actually learning how to play the game (I wish it took you through a few turns as a player). I'm new to board gaming, so maybe this was just just myself being unfamiliarized with this type of game.

I also find the military strategy a bit lacking compared to straight-lining to science or buildings. 

I can say that the Leaders expansion sort of fixes this issue giving some more military strategies as well as a more clear goal as you play the game.

Overall, a great game to play! I recommend 3 or more players.

The second step in introducing people to drafting (after Sushi-Go).  It's fairly light weight and I almost want more cards in each round of drafting.  Clearly inferior to Duel, and I wish they'd make a 2nd ed with some of the things they learned after making Duel (Such as gold cards and trading and the graphical design for chained buildings).

Next (second) level gateway game---that is I only play this one with new players when they've proven they are able to handle easier titles. Having said that, 7 Wonders does a great job providing pretty decent tactical gameplay, without significant AP issues. A must have for gaming groups in the 4-6 players range.

RATING: 7
Played once with four players and once with seven.

A short card-based game where players build up a city, getting points for various things that have been built.  Players must choose between building resources, building military power (there's no direct conflict between players, though), building science (to collect victory points), and abilities that get points or money from what your neighbors are doing.  

Players are dealt a hand of 7 cards, they choose 1 to play, and then pass the rest to their neighbor.  This repeats until the cards are exhausted, at which point a brief scoring occurs and it all happens 2 more times.  

The game allows players to interact with their two neighbors, but nobody else.  This is both good (it prevents you from having to look across the table lots), but also bad (as your score, and your abilities, depend greatly on what the two folks next to you are doing).

I'm mixed on this; it's a heavily random game (I couldn't build any advanced resource supply cards for most of the game, as I never saw them), but it's short enough that that's not a huge problem.

Update: After playing it with seven, I've realized that the game changes dramatically with the number of players.  When we played with four players, each person knew that they'd see at least a few cards from their original hand again; with seven, you never see those cards again.  So, the game turns into more of a card-counting game, where you go "Okay, if I've got this card there, and it's only one of two in the deck, then I'll likely never see it again".  The game is also hugely dependent on your neighbors, which can be a good or bad thing ...

Draft and play cards to improve your civilization for most points.

Plays: A dozen?
Type: VP engine = a game where you build an engine to collect victory points most efficiently.
Complexity: Light.
# of players: See BGG.
Playing time: 30 mins.
Player interaction: Opportunity prevention.
Randomness: Medium - initial 7-card hand.

Replayability: Medium, this probably has some depth to explore.
Fun: Not so much, I find the experience dry.
Memorability: Not really, VP engines don’t create stories.

Thematic integration: Strained.
Components: Good. I find any game that requires pen-and-paper scoring fiddly though.

Who will like this: Strategy gamers that want lighter fare before or after the main course. Family gamers that want to move into strategy games.

People say that this is a good gateway game, but I would disagree. In order to have any idea what to do, you need to have a good grasp of the cards that are due to come out later and what resources are required to build them. Without that knowledge, there is no agency so you are just playing randomly. From my experience, this has put off new gamers while not having enough depth to keep more experienced players interested.

Really great that it plays lots of players so easily and still scratches that strategy game itch.  Lots of agonizing decisions, but there's my one major fault with the game (and it's a personal preference, not necessarily a flaw): you're constantly deciding between doing something that advances your civilization and purposefully picking something else so that your neighbor can't get it.  I don't like having to play defense the entire game.  And yes, I realize that's what the game is all about, and that's how drafting works, so like I said, it's just not my style.

Legjobb benne, hogy valahol félúton jár a családi és a stratégiai játékok között, még akkor is, ha komplexitását tekintve inkább utóbbi, mint előbbi.

Az mondjuk kifejezetten zavar benne, hogy játék közben kevésbé látni, hogy ki hol áll pontok terén, a végén elég sokszor van meglepetés. Bár mások szerint meg pont ettől izgalmas.

Nagyon jó tabló építő játék egyébként, ami néhány év alatt megkerülhetetlen klasszikussá vált. Kiegészítőkkel még tovább lehet bonyolítani, bár néha már-már a játszhatóság határai súrolja az analízis-paralízis benne, ha telepakoljuk a kiegészítőkkel is.

Really love this game. Everything from the theme to the art and components is great.

Kind of like Fairy Tale, but more elegant and easier to approach. Better with fewer players, three or four is good. I like the game, but end up playing couple of games and feeling bored - the card pool is so shallow it gets a bit repetitive soon.

So it's fine, good if you need something fairly light that works well with a wide range of players, but for heavy rotation, I prefer Dominion's near-endless variety. Then again, I'm definitely a variety kind of gamer (nah, that's just my excuse to own 30+ Age of Steam maps).

My initial rating was 8, but 7 is more honest (and more appropriate), as I'm not that likely to suggest 7 Wonders. My mom loves the game, and I think I'll probably get enough 7 Wonders whenever I'm visiting her. (Dropped to 6 later.)

Ok, there is a lot wrong with this game - fiddly setup, reliance on iconography instead of clear, explanatory text, almost zero player interaction.

And yet, its assets far outweigh its liabilities: not including setup, it seriously is done in like 20 minutes with a group of four, and really no more than 40 with seven. And it plays seven in that amount of time! Seven players!!! Furthermore, the rules are incredibly easy to learn, and the only real struggle is figuring out what some of the cards do. At the end of it all, and in spite of its lack of interaction, it's somehow actually enjoyable - NOT the enjoyment of crushing one's enemies and seeing the lamentation of their women but the simple enjoyment of building a sand castle.

As predicted, this game got old fast with lots of players. Playing with 6 or 7 is just not that interesting to me. It doesn't feel interactive, and you never see the cards in your hand(s) again. It might be okay as a quick filler, but games are never that quick, so I'm always left wondering why I didn't just wait to play something else.

At the lower end of the player count, this does become a somewhat interesting game, and I must say I am impressed with the 2-player variant. It's nothing special--I'd consider it a "change of pace" from Dominion--but worthy nonetheless.

Given the prevalence of this game in every gaming circle through which I circulate, I no longer see any reason to own this game.

Likely the best drafting game out there.  I love card drafting in general coming from MtG, and this game delivers.  

There is a lot more depth of strategy than meets the eye.  Knowing the age 3 building costs and guilds and knowing what to prioritize early goes a long way in winning the game.  The strategy also changes significantly based on number of players (ex. military is much more powerful with fewer players).

Honestly, I really enjoyed this game at first, but I think it's a bit overrated now.  It's chief benefit is the short playing time and range of players.  The artwork is nice, and it's a pretty good little game, but it's not that deep and I'm a little burnt out on it, so I traded mine.  I may pick it up again, if they add some expansions.  It needs some variety.

Did receive again in a trade.  Not my fave but good for non-gamers, so I may pick up a couple of the new expansions.

Another great option is that it plays seven people so it's possible to enjoy a group game with a bit more depth than Incan Gold or Saboteur.

Civilization building in its most concentrated form- all of the resource management issues and paths to victory make for a really great game where strategy must shift based on the resources available.  Each game plays very differently than the one before, which gives this a lot of staying power.  Love it!

Even with 7 players, we can finish this deep thinky game in about 20 minutes.  7-Wonders is an amazing, masterwork of elegant game design!  The base game is really finely tuned and well-balanced and in each round you are presented with tough and interesting, fun choices.

I really like this game, but there's a phenomenon I've noticed with it: learning it isn't super fun, and it's rare that anyone wants to immediately play another game with it. It isn't super intuitive, and it's certainly doesn't make the gamestate clear while playing, only at the end. It also is barely interactive with other players. That said, it really is pretty fun when you get a group of people who are experienced in it.

We also always get the guild scoring wrong.

Végre kipróbálhattam, 7-en játszottuk, köztük 4 új (velem együtt), 3 tapasztalt, ilyen sorrendben ('csoportokban') ülve. Miután elmondták a szabályokat megmondtam a végeredményt, és nem tévedtem: az első az a tapasztalt játékos lett, aki az I. és III. kort tekintve a kezdők után következett (a többiek sorban a dobogón), az utolsó pedig az a kezdő, aki a 3 tapasztalt után jött elsőként..

Negatívum tehát, hogy igencsak számít az ülésrend. Csalódás volt számomra még a játékosok közötti interakció hiánya, mert bár figyelni kell a másikat, és hatással vagyunk egymásra (ez tetszik is), ez igaziból csak pontokban mutatkozik meg, játékban, akciókban igazából nem (még a vásárlásnál sincs semmi, csak megveszem a nyersanyagot a szomszédtól és kész). Ez szerintem nem is igazán interakció, csak csinálgatja mindenki a saját dolgát. Ez kifejezetten nem tetszett.

De! A pozitívumok: pont az előbbiből adódóan (mindenki csinálja a dolgát egyszerre) gyorsan lepereg, az említett 7 fős játék is 1 óra volt magyarázattal együtt. Előnnyel indul, aki ismeri a játékot, ez mutatja, hogy van benne stratégiai mélység, amit ki kell ismerni, hogy jól játsszuk. Van is kedvem játszani még vele, hiszen tényleg jó játék, de a Dicsőség Rómának! ezerszer jobb!!!

7 Wonders ist ein schnelles Spiel, in dem Karten reihum gedraftet werden. Die Karten stellen unterschiedliche, antike Gebäude dar. Dreh- und Angelpunkt sind die namensgebenden 7 Weltwunder. Zu Beginn sucht sich jeder Spieler eines dieser Bauwerke aus und versucht es im laufenden Spiel fertig zu stellen. Für den Sieg ist dies kein Muss, jedoch bringen die Weltwunder zusätzliche Siegpunkte. 7 Wonders ist für mich jetzt schon ein Klasiker, der wahrscheinlich auch in 10 Jahren noch auf den Tisch kommt. Die Regeln sind relativ einfach, die Möglichkeiten komplex und vielfältig. Der Rundenablauf ist flott, Downtime gibt es quasi nicht. Mit den zusätzlichen Erweiterungen (Cities und Leaders), spielt sich 7 Wonders immer wieder anders.

I LOVE simultaneous play. I have an attention span on the shorter side for games, so this beauty is perfect for me. So great for large groups as well. Don't, however, try and teach a large group of first timers. Best to learn in small groups then combine forces at a later date. I made that mistake initially and it was total chaos that really turned me off to the game for a bit. Now it's one of our groups favorites, played at almost every session. It's really fun when you get to the point where you know the game well enough to incorporate hand management into your play and can manipulate the cards that are available to the other players.

RATING: 8
Wasn't greatly impressed with this on my first play, mainly due to the chaos of joining an 8 player version with lots of newbies and a very rough game rule explanation. After a few plays its starting to grow on me and I can see its appeal as a quick, reasonably involved filler for a large group. Once players are familiar with the rules, which are short but not entirely intuitive and the symbols are sometimes too abstract (not unlike Race for the Galaxy), 7 Wonders moves along at a quick and satisfying pace. Am keen to play a few more basic games before introducing the expansions, which I believe only improve the base game.

>>I think 7 Wonders is still a good game but the base game appears to lose its appeal from being repetitive, and even experienced players still struggle to re member what the various icons mean. The Cities expansion adds some variety, but again with more cryptic icons!

>>>God I'm crap at winning this game but it is good fun, and really shines as a fast game for large groups. Works well during lunchtime at my workplace with any sized group. Yes, it's a game of drafting with neighbours but it's also interesting to see how the larger game is progressing. My only niggle is the constant reminding people how the rules work and what the icons mean.

Once you have learned the symbology (which is more intuitive than that of Race for the Galaxy), this becomes a really fast filler game that scales unto 7 players without slowing the game down.
There are plenty of different strategies you can adopt and with 14 possible starting card options the game has true re-playability.
It is rare to find a game that lives unto it's hype!

I always enjoy this one...even after almost 30 plays. The decisions feel interesting, the play is wonderfully fast and doesn't slow down with the addition of extra players much at all.

It offers a nice mix of resource generation and ways to use those resources. I like the drafting mechanic but admit that it can limit the game to the experience of the other players - in other words it is possible to have other people's decisions limit what you can ultimately achieve.

I suspect that it could lose its charm if you were playing 5+ games a week but then again at the time frame it probably won't.

Tends to always throw up close finishes too - usually a sign of good balance.

One play impression: I can see why 7 Wonders rates so high with others.  It's a fast playing drafting game, it feels like you are civ building, it has lots of strategies that you can pursue, and its easy to learn but harder to master.  The artwork is great and relly helps pull you into the theme.  I learned that your choice of cards in the first round is really important because the two rounds after that has cards that can be only be played as long as you have the prerequisites in place.  I went heavy on military cards when it seems that the green (science?) cards are the way to go to ensure victory.  I'll definitely read the rules before my next game to ensure I have a better understanding...

One of my current favorites. Got my sister, nephew and nieces hooked.  A "go to" game in my family. +1 for going up to 7 and +1 for (reasonably) consistent play time regardless of the number of players.

RATING: 9
This game is, in my eyes, a perfect game design. It looks beautiful, the mechanics are good, the downtime is minimal and it scales well from 3 players and upwards. You can also choose your level of complexity; it is as fun to play "casually" as it is if you really pay attention to what others are getting, what cards to pass on or not, etc. 7 Wonders is just always fun to play, even if you don't win!

I really enjoyed the simple gameplay and asymmetrical competitive nature of the game. Its like Age of Empires, the board game. A little afraid of over complicating the experience with the expansions, since its so slick to play as is.

RATING: 7
I've played 7 Wonders well over 50 times, and as much as I enjoy it, there's not a lot more for me to see here. I was okay letting my copy go, especially since games like Blood Rage exist. Still, this game gave me plenty of plays before I grew bored with it, and it's one that I can objectively say is an amazing design.

RATING: 4
Quite a disappointment, this one.
I thought it could have a little bit more depth. Some good mechanics, but very light game. To easy to play, I'm afraid it will not have many replayabliliy.  I think the game was funny, but nothing to offer in game strategies. It's to much easy to get all that you want. Nothing special here.

This is the first card drafting game that me and my wife added to our collection.

We have really enjoyed playing this game and anytime that we have more than 4 or 5 people in the house, this is the game we pull out.

However, I will say that the replay value on this game is not the highest in my opinion.  I think I have played it 10 or so times and I have lost a bit of interest in it.

Elegant mechanisms where simultaneous turns mimimize the downtime. However, without knowing the many different cards it is difficult to set up a strategy and if you sit between two aggressive players, you suffer double since you both get attacked and lack trading partners. Still, this is probably the best of the many card drafting games out there.

The first time I played 7 Wonders, I immediately knew it was a keeper.  It's a lot of fun to see how your little empire builds up over the course of a game, and I love how there is no down time.

Superb game. 
Still have not come up with a good strategy for playing this game - I feel like I'm making it up on the fly every time. But the art is great, the notion that everyone is playing simultaneously is very good, and it is a lot of fun.

Problem: This is another game where analysis paralysis could set in and slow everything to a crawl. Don't be that guy.

Just a very enjoyable gaming experience. The indirect nature of the interaction ensures no one feels picked-on.

Challenge: 5/5
Plenty of tough decisions, that just keep on coming. Lots to analyse but with so many unknowns, your intuition is often the best bet.

Theme: 3/5
You get to enjoy building up a city from humble beginnings. Trade and conflict with your neighbours adds to the theme. The fantastic artwork also contributes.

Overall: 5/5
One of my favourite games and can be enjoyed by gamers and non-gamers alike.

I didn't get it. The game-play was the same as Sushi-Go, but there was all this extra stuff. Even after 3 games I had no idea what I was doing, and ended up losing because I was just taking random cards from the ones handed to me. None of the strategies I employed seemed to work, and I just got frustrated. I would give it another shot given the chance, but they'd have to really work to get me to enjoy this game. There are too many better games out there that I'd rather play.

2 Players:

Enjoyable and multi-layered game, a light version of Civilisation with enough routes to ensure that tactics can change on the fly.  I enjoy the way the game opens up through the three ages, also the challenge of playing with different player boards and taking turns to activate the Free City.  This game is likely to have a secure place in the collection for a long time to come.

I fear Antoine Bauza will be confined in my mind to the realm of games the idea of which markets fantastically while the reality ends up underwhelming after a play or two. Here are the numerous issues with 7 Wonders:

- For the amount of interesting decisions you get, the game is really hard to teach.
- There are 7 ways to score victory points at the end of the game. Some of them imply several mathematical operations. Because of that, determining the leading player or the viability of your current plan is a chore.
- You barely interact with your neighbours and the potential drafting shenanigans are totally incidental. You can't even refuse a trade.
- The tech tree is stupidly hard to learn by heart, there is only one player aid for the whole table and, to make it worse, the ratio of cards of each type is dependent on the number of players.
- You can't count on a given guild card fitting your plan to be present in a given game (let alone then tabling to you); thus the whole guild card type is about randomly giving a swingy amount of endgame points.
- Counterpicks are not a thing because they penalise you alongside the bashed player while helping everybody else.
- Amongst all the choices you have, you're lucky to ever get more than two that are contenders for "best move this turn". The game is quite autopiloty, especially in later parts.
- Being able to care about what other players do would require a turn order rather than simultaneous play, which would unfortunately triple the play time.

As a result, nobody at my table is laughing or smiling or talking, aside from the occasional forced trade. It's pretty much a solitaire experience - and not even a good one.

This game is virtually impossible to settle on a consistent winning strategy since there are so many variables including number of players, personality of players, random playing boards, and randomness of card drafting. I enjoyed it more when card selection was done in turns instead of simultaneously, the latter ended up feeling like I was playing a very hectic solitaire where I had no idea how I was doing until the final scores were tallied.

RATING: 9
Quite a sleek design. Plays fast and is a lot of fun. I like how it offers simultaneous play so it moves smoothly even with high numbers of players. And you really have to think, both to decide what you want, and to make sure other people don't get what they want.

In fact the design is so streamlined I don't think I want to buy any expansions for this. I'm worried that it will dilute the experience.

RATING: 4.75
- Aucune interaction avec les joueurs à l'autre bout de la table;

- En ne pouvant recevoir deux fois le même paquet de cartes à 6 ou 7 joueurs, il est impossible de choisir deux cartes dans le même paquet. Contrairement à d'autres jeux de "draft" (Citadels, Fairy Tales, Magic), il n'est pas possible de constater, au cours du draft, quelles cartes ont déjà été sélectionnées et quelles ne l'ont pas encore été. De plus, l'ambiance est bien souvent celle-ci: On attend que le dernier joueur ait sélectionné sa carte (petits temps morts), puis, lorsque c'est fait, on regarde notre propre zone de la table, sans trop s'attarder aux autres joueurs.

- Il est impossible d'acquérir des cartes de ressources à l'Âge 3. Cela implique donc de devoir sélectionner à l'Âge 1 les cartes ressources lorsque cela est possible, à moins que nos voisins immédiats fassent le travail pour nous et que des cartes style "Comptoir" nous soient disponibles. Bref, la rejouabilité est peut-être un peu altérée par ce détail, car la première phase du jeu semble être assez "scriptée".

- Des joueurs expérimentés semblent être avantagés, pouvant tirer profit de mauvaises décisions de leurs voisins moins aguerris tout en étant relativement peu vulnérables face à ces derniers.

- Jeu un peu trop court pour autant de matériel utilisé.

One of the few games that others friends have that I tried, then one of them bought it for me. Not my favourite Drafting game, and barely gets any time at the table, nice to have in the collection though as it can play quite nicely with more people.

Elegant, almost perfectly balanced mechanics. The best thing about this game is that there is no universal strategy, you need to be flexible and react to what's going on. Slightly random.

After 6 games, updated from 8 to 9.

After ~30 games, updated from 9 to 9.9. Only minor (even unnoticable for most people!) issues with balance prevent me from giving 7 Wonders the maximum rating.
The ramdomness I mentioned before is actually not important, as it's counterbalanced by the drafting mechanism.

Quite a fun little game that packs a whole lot into relatively quick gameplay. I found the idea of trading and warring with only the two closest players to be refreshing. I'm sure I've got a lot to learn regarding finite strategy with this game, but I do feel there are some balance issues between some wonders. Clearly Halicarnassus has the best ability in the game and I've found that whoever has it tends to win. The drafting mechanic is relatively simple and resource costs make sense to me, but for some reason it's been hard for newer players to connect with. That being said I don't feel like this is a great game for entry level board gamers. It's been easier for me to teach some heavier Euro-games than this, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Can't fault it too much as it's a blast with people who get the hang of it.

The more I play this game the more I enjoy it.  Once you can comprehend what the symbols mean the gameplay becomes very streamlined and you can knock out a bunch of games in a row.  Even non-gamer family members enjoyed this game once they picked up the symbology.  Strongly recommend printing out the player aids in the files section to help with the symbols (even though people will ask you what they mean anyways).  Looking to get the expansions but in due time.  The one annoying aspect is scoring, if you can find a scoring app do it, just makes it that much easier.

This is what good game design is all about. Easy to learn, difficult to master. Offers something for both casuals and gamers alike. Skill in 7 Wonders comes from observing your opponents and trying to foil their schemes.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
In this card game, each player starts as a Wonder (with different abilities). Game plays in 3 ages. Each age you select from 1 of 7 cards, pass them on,  play the card, select from 6 and so on, until you have played 6 cards per age. The cards have various casting costs, or provide resources. The interaction is being able to purchase goods from your left and right hand neighbor, while you also earn/lose points through military with your neighbors. The cards played provide points, and you can also construct stages of wonders on your board for points. 

This is a really good game, and makes you want to come back for more. There is a ton of variety, and different apporaches to take. As well, this game fits in 7 people! Rating likely to rise with more plays.

This game is great for filling that niche of a nice fairly quick, fairly light game that is scalable to a big tableful of people.

You can go through the game happily enough without stressing too much, just watching your little civilization grow, or you can engage your brain with tracking your opponents developments and trying to optimize everything. This game works well in a good variety of situations, with different numbers of players of different tastes, ability levels and ages. I've never had a bad game of 7 Wonders. That's why it's always available to play when we have people round for games.

I hear great things about it and like the short time it takes. It looks like it really does better with 3+ so that makes it mostly out for us because I can only rely on 2 and I'm not crazy excited for it. However, I definitely want to play to try it out.
UPDATE:
I had a chance to play it and I like it so far. I don't think I've had enough experience to determine how I feel completely yet. I definitely enjoyed the play through but didn't gain a strong enough understanding yet to judge. However, I like the components a great deal and the card drafting and passing mechanic seems slick and original. It seems that there's less punishment for having a poor hand in this way because of the passing/drafting and how this can be utilized strategically. Its a set collection and economic game that's very euro and I didn't mind it at all. I look forward to trying it more.

Feb 2014: almost 20 plays, 2p only, initial rating 7.5 raised to 8.5, restrictions in the official variant (overlooked in a couple of first games) make 2p game very tense with many interesting desisions, highly recommended for players looking for a fast played civ-themed gem (sic!)

Interesting drafting game. The theme rocks, and the artwork really catches the eye. Hence it is easy to get people excited about the game.
The rules are simple enough to teach to practically anyone, but there are certain rules that some people find difficult to understand (some don't get the resource production, some the buying, and so on), but after vigorious exampling anyone should be up to speed.

RATING: 9.5
My wife and I love to play this game, it is one of our favorites. I think the brilliance of this game is how quick it plays with 2 players and it plays in the same time with 7 players.

There doesn't seem to be very many good strategy games that a large group can play in under an hour, including set-up and take-down time, but 7 Wonders is one of them.

The other thing I love about this game is how balanced it is. There are so many ways to win. The problem is, each game, I see multiple paths I could take and it is hard to discern what the best path is because I want to take them all!

Great gateway-plus game. It's a little complicated to explain initially if you're not familiar with the card-drafting mechanic, and there are a lot of little icons and things to figure out, but once we played through a couple of rounds it was straightforward, and it plays quickly since everyone decides which card to play simultaneously. There are lots of really interesting choices to make (balanced between building yourself up and messing up other people) without feeling overwhelming. It's also one of the few non-party games that plays reasonably fast with lots of people.

An elegant card drafting game that accommodates up to seven people with ease and still within 40 minutes. Games always vary, based upon guild cards, starting player wonder mat and the randomness of the cards. This creates a lot of replay value, which is guaranteed for this game. Game is quite balanced, resources can be purchased from your neighbours for flexibility and there is many paths to victory.  Overall a very fun game that can be played over a hundred times. 

Cons:
-Little interaction with all players, confined to immediate neighbours.
-Choices can be obvious for skilled players, creating an ‘autopilot’ gameplay.

I didn't initially like this game since I found it hard to follow, but after studying up on the rules a bit and replaying it, I finally understood it a bit more and enjoyed it more. Since then, I've played it even more and enjoy it quite a bit now. I love how fast it plays given how many decisions are in the game. My only qualm is that its not strategically deep, and Id prefer to play one of those games. Its tactically interesting though I suppose, but theres only so much long term planning you can do.

Getting a little tired of 7 W after many many plays. I find that at 6/7p it doesnt work well because resources are too short so its harder to build much of anything depending on what neighbors are next to you. And at 3-5p I have many other games I prefer and would rather play like my top faves. And then i wouldnt enjoy this 2p i suspect. Trading now.

Solid medium-weight-but-fast-playing game. Interesting in that most of the game interactions are with your neighbors (players to your left and right).

This makes it a little harder to learn & get into, but otherwise its a great game.

Juego de cartas basado en el mismo principio de la variante Draft de Magic The Gathering: consiste de tres rondas en las que cada jugador recibe una mano inicial de 7 cartas, debe mantener una y pasar el resto a la persona que tenga al lado.
La diferencia con el Draft está en que las cartas que uno roba debe jugarlas inmediatamente en vez de mantenerlas para armar una baraja.
Las cartas representan recursos (con los cuales se paga el costo de usar otras cartas), poder militar, tesoros, avances tecnológicos, edificaciones, etc. y combinándolas de distintas maneras (y en ocasiones teniendo en cuenta las cartas que hayan usado los jugadores sentados a la derecha e izquierda) permiten obtener puntos.
Es super sencillo de aprender y además es muy ágil, una partida dura menos de media hora.
Es un juego excelente, de mis favoritos actuales aunque aun no lo he jugado tanto como quisiera.

7 Wonders is a winner.  With fewer players you have significantly more control over the game.  With 6 or 7 you lose that, but you've still got a fun game that plays in 30 minutes and how many 6/7 player games do that?

7 Wonders was one of the first board games of the new generation that impressed me. Nice and quite simple mechanics, very good iconography, this game is a lot of fun. A few things bother me, though. First, contrary to most people, I don't think it scales that well. With up to five players, you can still compete with a fair setup, since everybody shares at least one neighbour. With more than that, though, you can sometimes fall between people with a very different level and have a very unbalanced experience. In any case, it's a fun game anyway, just not a very fair one.

Second, although the rules are quite simple and the iconography well made, this game is still a pain to teach. Too many icons and very creative rules makes it very hard for a newbie to grok. Sometimes, even intermediate gamers may suffer a bit.

Third, it goes for too long. For a simple game, 7 Wonders, for me, overstays its welcome a bit much. There are deeper games out there, with more things to do, and sometimes simpler to teach, that take around the same time.

Finally, the final scoring is a chore. This is actually also part of the problem I have when teaching it. Every time I must teach someone about the technology scoring it's a nightmare. Sure, they understand the math, but they seem not to understand why such an annoying system was chosen for this game. Neither do I.

This is (IMHO) the top-tier drafting game. It plays quickly and with the expansions makes for some very interesting combinations of decisions. The only "beware" note is that the Science strategy can be a winning one every time (or almost every time) if more than one players isn't pursuing it. Everyone needs at least a "little" bit of science to prevent one player from running away with a win.

One of those "nomen est omen" games as for about the first 7 plays it feels like the game does wonders to you but replay value rapidly wears off after.

Fun civilization-lite game.  Set-up according to number of players is a bit bothersome, but it is a quick and fun game.

I still don't see the need to purchase the expansions as they increase both play-time and complexity without making the game that much better.

My girlfriend likes it.

Update 1 (1/12/15):  I purchased Among the Stars to supplant the need for either 7 Wonders or Race for the Galaxy, but I haven't played enough Among the Stars to validate the claim.  Still, I don't feel like I need to play more of 7 Wonders or expand it and a big part of it, is the dummy player for 2p.  Maybe later on I would buy the expansions, though I still don't feel they are worth 20 bucks each.

Update 2:  Looking forward to playing this game with more than 2 players, especially because Among the Stars did not win me over with its theme and I kept looking for excuses not to play it.

Update 3: Plays well with 4-players and Cities included.  Very quick game and rewarding.

So after seven plays of 7 Wonders I think it's time to rate it as a solid 7...

...anyway, the idea of drafting cards by passing small decks from player to player is certainly not new, but basing an entire game around it is definetivly special.

A game of 7 Wonders is divided into three ages. In each age, players gets seven cards each, picks one of these to play and then passes the remaining cards to the next player. This is repeated until all cards have been played.
Cards fill different funtions. For instance, brown and grey cards are production that is needed to play cards of differend colour. Other cards represent military, economy, technology, monuments and so on.
Also, cards become progressively better in each age, but you need cards from precious ages to play the later ones.

Just about everything you do in 7 Wonders will score points, but figuring out how to score a lot while at the same time keeping the other players down is certainly not easy. I like how cards scores differently. Blue, green and red cards all score points, but in varying ways. For instance, green is set collecting, while red is a race against your neighbours.

You can also use the cards to build on your unique Wonder, or simply discard them for money.
Finally, you are allowed to use the production of neighbouring players if you pay them.

It's easy to think of this as solitaire, but you need to keep an eye on the other players. Perhaps you don't want to go for green cards if to many other players are doing so, but you might need to do so if only one player is going green...

While there are lot's of different options with the different kind of cards, the best option seems to be to do a little bit of everything. This makes the game a bit too unfocused for me some times.
More importantly, this lack of variation makes the above mentioned solid 7 a lot less solid. It might even border on a 6...

If you add the Leaders expansion you add a bit of focus, making the game jump from 7 to an 8, perhaps even a 9!

Have played about a dozen times and taught to several groups.
Although I don't mind teaching, would actively avoid playing again.

Why don't I like 7 Wonders? It's priced like a premium board game and comes in a large box, but is essentially just a large deck of cards and some chips. Iconography and scoring are too convoluted to make it easy to introduce to non-gamers, but the game depth is very limited (especially with larger groups) making it a poor choice for gamers. Player boards are very poorly balanced. Player interaction outside of the standard card draft is very limited and mostly incidental. Theme is just a justification for the artwork instead of having any value in the game.

What does it do well? Scale to different player counts - there aren't many games that work with 7 or with 2 players. You lose strategic depth that way, but the game works well enough and (outside of lengthy scoring at the end of game) the time-to-play doesn't change significantly. The art is very nice.

There are better drafting games. There are better filler games. There are better party games. There are better games with large groups. There are better games with small groups. There are better gamers to bring out with non-gamers. So what niche is 7 Wonders supposed to fill?

Many people love 7 Wonders... I'm squarely not in that category.

Good game, not my favorite. Card drafting is good and the gameplay seems fun and streamline. I appreciate the different paths to victory and the interactive nature between players. Overall, it does a good job at mechanics. So why not higher? I'm not entirely sure, maybe I am just wanting more theme--it just seems a little thin on the feels.

Fairy Tale spin-off as interactive and fun as knitting mittens in front of a mirror. Who won? Oh that guy over there. How did you manage to pull this win? By having neighbors with ressources I needed and wasting 30 minutes of my life.

RATING: 6
7 Wonders is a fun, fast-paced card drafting, light civilization building game... until the endgame scoring. Everything grinds to a halt as one person tallies everyone's scores before announcing a victory. "And the winner is... Math!" A great game hampered slightly by a boring endgame.

On the bright side, if you are recording your gameplays on BGG, this is the easiest game to input as 7 Wonders forces you to write the details of each game out to find out who wins.

Another complaint is the main game component, the cards, are not very durable and will quickly show wear. Also, although advertised as a 2-7 player game, the 2-player version is a variant that requires a Dummy 3rd player which isn't ever a good implementation.

The only real gameplay difficulty is teaching new players to be aware of cards with prerequisites. The progression icons are tiny and easily overlooked.

A very fun card-drafting game where you start with seven cards, pick one to play on your wonder, than pass the 6 left over to your neighbor.  You than look at the 6 cards handed to you from your opposite neighbor, pick one to play, than pass the rest to your neighbor.  Do this until one card is left, throw it away, than move on to the next 'age', three ages in a game.

Fun game that plays up to 7 easily without really adding much time from 4 players to 7.

Tras jugarlo he entendido rápidamente por qué gusta tanto. Es sencillo, emocionante y dinámico, con resultados a veces sorprendentes, con tantas variaciones, que después de una partida va otra.

El juego es, desde luego, una maravilla. Lo que no me parece tan maravilloso es que más que un juego de tablero es de cartas y viene en una caja desproporcionada donde sobra demasiado espacio. Me imagino que en ella cabrán las expansiones, pero prefiero una caja más pequeña y no llevarnos a engaño. Bastante me ocupan los juegos en casa, cada vez que uno viene con un 50% de aire pongo los ojos en blanco. Tal vez ayude a justificar el precio, que si bien me parece un pelín caro para la cantidad de material que hay, para mí está correcto sólo por el diseño del juego (su mecánica y que lo veo bien hecho) y las siempre increíbles ilustraciones de Miguel Coimbra (en tono más realista que Small World por ejemplo). Seguramente el mismo juego en un formato de cartas más estandar con unos ajustes en las fichas de Maravilla podía caber en una caja tamaño Bang!

Y es que ese es otro punto del juego: el tamaño de las cartas. Recomiendo comprar las fundas especiales (que no se encuentran actualmente en las tiendas, sólo online, y que desgraciadamente vienen en packs de 100 así que hay que gastarse más o menos 5€ para que te sobren 50). Un gasto extra, pero es que las cartas van a tener mucho trote...

El juego depende mucho de la suerte, tal vez demasiado, por lo que idear estrategias puede resultar muy frustrante. Así que a mi parecer es un juego de no comerte mucho la cabeza e ir haciendo lo que parezca más ventajoso (que ahí radica la parte estratégica, hacer las mejores elecciones es lo difícil) y no mirar demasiado hacia adelante o confiar en la suerte. 

Desarrolla tu civilización y elige entre la guerra, la ciencia, el comercio, la cultura o tener la mejor maravilla del mundo!

RATING: 7
The game has falls in the "middle category" - I have not had much success using this as a gateway game for new players (as opposed to something like Stone Age), and it does not have the "meaty" decisions required for a group of serious gamers.

It's saving grace is that game time is short - however, I'd rather play Glory to Rome in the same time.

It's a game that newbs love but it takes so damn long to explain. And for me, it's one of the least fun explanations. Last time I played, it was an 8er with Cities expansion, and that kinda turned me off... it seems like with that many, you're not in control of your destiny as much as you are in the smaller games. 

On the plus side, once you get going, you can play a few rounds since it plays pretty quickly. The cards and how they come together -- all quite clever.

OK, it's a fun game when everyone knows it. So a 5 with newbs and a 7.5 with experienced players.

RATING: 7.5
This is a nifty game! Scales up so effortlessly and has many meaningful choices packed into a short ~30 minute game. First, a couple negatives:

One slow player can make this game drag! If you play with someone who is prone to AP or just scatterbrained, hands of cards will start to pile up next to them and then the happiness of simultaneous turns will vanish. Not a huge problem, but I like this game as a fast game. Not a slow one.

I don't really get it. Yes, that's not the game's fault, but I really struggle with the strategy I believe. I do reasonably well with the people I play with, but I can't tell when I play a game well, or not. Part of this is a testament to 7 wonders. There are a few different paths to victory, and that makes the choices in the game not always obvious.

On the positive side:

I love the artwork! Cards are fun to look at and they make it easier to imagine your civilization grow. It's a pretty quick game, so you can play a few games even on a tight schedule. Mechanics are nice and sensible, and there is more than enough strategy to chew on.

So, I probably haven't given this game the proper plays it deserves. As of now, it's not a favorite of mine, but it's on the next tier of games.

RATING: 6
BGG hype-train of 2010, played in the first weekend of 2011.  Result?  OK, broken clock -- you win this time.

It's a clever little drafting game that forces a number of difficult decisions in a short amount of time.  It seats anywhere from 3-7 seamlessly.  And again, it's over almost before it starts.  There's a couple of clearly over-developed paths to victory, which is its only real downside.  You're going green or blue/red, or you're going home.  And by the time Act II shows up, your choices are already made for you.

The other downside is a product of its own making; there's no way this game could live up to its hype.  30-min civ game?  No.  It's a slightly more complex Fairy Tale with a new theme, and it costs 3x as much.

2017 UPDATE: Not much has changed.  I'll play this game whenever you put it in front of me, especially if you're new to gaming.  But it's not my go-to game and it never will be.

Wonderful game (pun inteded). I know I'm in a minority to say that 7 Wonders is a great two-player game out of the box. The free city gives you more choices to ponder upon and screw your opponents game.

Fast drafting game that supports many, plays quickly and is easy to teach. It tends to feel a bit samey sometimes, and the drafting aspect doesn't compare to Magic: the Gathering. Nevertheless, it is good fun and a good contender in the filler-length bracket.

I have found that going for all of one thing rarely works out well (although when it does it can be ridiculous, particularly science); going for a bit of everything consistently places well (hence the samey feeling).

RATING: 7
For starters, you get a hand of seven cards and can play one. Without knowing what you're going to see down the line, it's pretty hard to determine what the best cards to pick will be. You have little idea of what resources you're going to want, and you may simply never see certain cards if others get them before you. It seems like this is almost completely the luck of the draw.

I've not played this with three players yet, but I think that might have a bit more strategy to it. A six player game is almost complete randomness. Not terrible, but not that exciting.

After playing this with two, I think this is the best way to play. This actually brought my rating up. You see more cards and with the added strategy of deciding what to do with the NPC, there is far more strategy here than with more players.

After four plays with three, I think this works well with three. You can more easily keep track of what other players are doing, so you can have a better idea of what to pass/keep/bury. I think I'd prefer this as a three player, playing a few games in a session.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Fast card drafting game not very deep, but with a nice number of decisions.

I don't agree with the people that say there's no interaction. You have to see what people are building to maximize your strategy and even if you can only interact directly with the 2 neighbours, more interaction would lead to gang-banging againt the leader.

I think it plays out best with 4 players (6-7 is way too much, you never see again the cards your pass).

RATING: 8
A very fast "civ game" built around drafting. Mechanically very solid and fast to play. Drafting part is best with 3 or 4 players as then you get same hands back a couple of times and can actually do a bit more than just react to cards you have. Every player start with different wonder that can in 3-4 stages giving different bonuses and gives your start resource engine. There are some tougher decisions to be made during game but it is still pretty simple game. Biggest thing is the fact it works rather well up to 7 players and is easily playable under 60 minutes even then.

Cards are of course a size that doesn't fit nicely in any card protector available (yet). This can be a problem as you use a different subset of cards depending a number of players and cards are easily-markable-black-bordered, of course.

This is the most played game in my house, and not for nothing, the game plays fast, it escalates really good with more players and it is fun as hell. For more strategy you should definitely play it with Leaders. For more variety, play it with Cities and Wonder Pack.
For scoring purposes, you should definitely use 7 Wonders Companion for IOS and/or Android.

Roughly 10 plays in 2013. Concept of handing your hand to your neighbour is nice, but means you have to take into account in your "strategy" that you may not get that other good card you had in your hand back when this hand has gone a full round. Have to try this more to see if it can grow on me further.
Not mixed in the expansions yet.

A very quick and simple civilization game based on drafting, with great artwork. Number of players does not affect the game length.

I'm not quite convinced about replayability, though. And I really don't appreciate the need to memorize the free building chains.

Not currently interested in buying because of the poor component choices. The cards are oversized and seriously lack durability. The box is also way too big for a quick card game; There's no way I can haul this to the pub.

Played many times now and really enjoy it. Another game where you can take a strategic stance and then play each turn tactically depending on your hand. Fantastic. 

My only minor gripe is that when there's a group of 7 people floating around it's always requested, rather than people splitting into groups of 3 and 4. It's a minor complaint but it can lead to playing 7 Wonders every single week if you go to a well populated gaming group, and whilst it is a great game I don't want to play it every week instead of other games that don't get to the table as often.

RATING: 9
Rating after 50+ games.  Really enjoying it...unlike some detractors, I don't see an "obvious" play every turn.  Several times during the game, I was torn between 2 or 3 cards to choose from...as well as considering what not to pass my opponent.  Have played throughout the recommended range of player (3-7) and found that it scales well throughout the range.  Played several 7-player games that only took a few minutes longer than our 3 and 4-player games...

It's a very fun experience, although I question if the game has replayability.  My prediction is that further expansion will solve that problem for me though!

Small deduction for the low printing quality.  The cards become damaged on the very first play no matter how careful you are with them.  The player boards also need flexing in order to keep them lying flat.

7 wonders is strong, fast, and smart.  The end.

Anyone can play this game [the 2 player variant proves it!] and it really feels like you're generating a civilization.  Is it the end all be all civilization game?  No, god no.  This is a civ-light game and you're really just playing different 'types' of cards that affect a different aspect of point calculation.

But it still feels cool and like you're developing a civilization!

Now.  If you're the type that just see's the score system and will take 10x longer than everyone else per turn to optimize everything, then go stay with your heavier games.

This game is light!  But it's a fun light game.  I can play heavier games and enjoy this one for what it is.  The art work is fun and the mechanics blend in with the theme and after a game or two the games are pretty fast!

Negative reviews usually attack this game because it's 'simple'.  It is.  This game won a ton of rewards probably because it appeals to such a broad scope of people.  And for me, a person who hosts games for not just a set group of people, but literally people I just met and who usually play video games, this is great!

If you have a set group of hardcore gamers who only play TI3 or Dune, then this game probably isn't for you.  But respect the game, it's good.

RATING: 9
I'm sure that I will eventually start to get tired of this game, but at the moment, I will play it whenever offered.  It's as close to a "10" as I would get right now.  It really scratches the drafting itch that I have from being a long-time CCG player.  Amused by the notion that this could be considered "multiplayer solitaire" seeing as how you know the options being passed to you, and from you, to other players, which affects your strategy.  My only major problem with the game is that you really only focus on the players to your immediate left and right.  It's frustrating in a large game when someone across the table wins -- it's not like you could do much about that.

RATING: 6
Gioco semplice, veloce e capace di unire in un tavolo fino a 7 giocatori! Questo è il segreto di 7 Wonders, gioco che per linearità può ricordare Dominion, ovvero un card game travestito da board game. Non stiamo parlando di un capolavoro di strategia e meccanica tipo Puerto Rico o Caylus, ma di un fillerone, un tappabuchi dalla durata contenuta (specie dopo le prime partite di rodagio). Tra gli aspetti negativi c'è sicuramente la poca interazione (diciamo pure assente) con chi non è seduto vicino, ma che rispecchia la poca influenza che civiltà lontane possono avere tra loro. Il prezzo è abbastanza alto in rapportato ai materiali. A mio avviso è un titolo un po' sopravvalutato.

Almost deliriously good at first, although I have a few worries that the nitty-gritty of the game might come down to randomness and an inability to go back on some well-laid strategies which would be fouled up by nothing other than (bad) luck. Spot-on iconography really helps the process flow, though, and playing at well under an hour makes it a very difficult option to turn down.

Fun drafting game for up to 7 people. 
2 Player version seems a little "artificial" at first with both players playing for the free city, but after a while I actually found it quiet fun also with 2. It's just a very different game as the cards come back to you more often and you can plan more ahead than in a game with more players, where you just don't know what you're going to get. So I like both now, it just has a different feel with 2 (or 3) than with more, but both is fine for me.

With the expansions (especially Babel for more players) which bring up the variety, it's a solid 8 now.

A very good and pleasant FILLER. This is the major problem, and at the same time its advantage, of this game: it is basically a filler for a large group.
It has several paths to victory and some strategy, but it is heavily conditioned by luck. Moreover, players' interaction is very very indirect.
Last but not least, the feeling of building a "wonder" is inexistent, you build it whenever the cards you receive are bad.

Used to be a No. 1 fast game for big company *big - >4*. Played it too much probably (~200 times) so it is collecting dust now. Recommend this one as a gateway. Strong 8/10 as can't find a competitor for all the positives: art/rules/gameplay/simplicity + girls like that.

RATING: 4.5
Played 2 games with 3 players. Good and relatively quick, I'm excited that it scales nicely with larger groups. On these merits, I'd call it about a 7.5.

But ultimately, I just don't and can't get excited to play it. I won't completely avoid it, but I'll lean away from it every time. For this reason, it gets a 4.5.

The Babel expansion is neat, Leaders is garbage.

RATING: 7.5
Juego fácil de jugar y rápido, con mucha rejugabilidad debido a su amplio número de posibles combinaciones al jugar las cartas con los diferentes tableros. Lo único que no me gusta de este juego es que es más largo explicarlo que jugarlo, a pesar de tener una dinámica muy fácil la cantidad de formas de generar puntos hace que su explicación se torne larga y un poco tediosa.
Una vez que lo has jugado ya un par de veces se vuelve un juego fabuloso.
----------
Easy and fast to play, and it can be played over and over without being the same again as it's numerous cards and boards gives you a huge amount of possible combinations to avoid repetitions. The only downside for me is that it takes way to long to be explained (even though the dynamic of it is quite simple) as you have many possible ways to score making the explanation fase long and tedious.
Once you've played it a couple of times it becomes a fab game.

Very good civ light, however missing a little bit direct interaction for my taste (and a board). The artwork is really beautiful. Apart from the theme, it's very much an "okay game above the average". One great strength it has is that it scales very well. Also, it's easy to learn and forgiving. And with 1 hour play time or less it is short, yet still provides a good experience. 
However, I will always prefer a full civ game if the time frame allows it. 7 Wonders is just too light for me - not to say I have mastered it, but building a civilization has to feel EPIC in order to really impress me as a theme.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (10):[/COLOR]

[i]- Beautiful artwork on the cards which helps the theme come through.
- Plays well with 3+ players.
- Quick playtime (under 45 minutes) even once you add more players.
- Card drafting made extremely accessible, this is an easy game to teach.
- I enjoy building a tableau of cards that builds on itself and allows you to obtain better cards.
- There are enough different ways to win which helping to give this game good replay value.
- Great game to begin/end a game night.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8.5):[/COLOR]

[i]I will start by saying that I had been looking at this game every time I am looking for a new family game to play with both of my older kids and my wife. Well I don't know if it is the #1 family game but it is a really great family game. There are two things that really make this game shine for my family.

First is the simultaneous card drafting, there is absolutely no down time in this game. As much as we love playing games like Kingsburg or Stone Age there can be extended periods of downtime while someone is trying to figure out their optimal move. In 7 Wonders everyone is making that choice at the same time and as the amount of cards you have to pick from dwindles the pace of the game picks up. 

This leads into the second highlight of this game: 1/2 hour game length with 3+ players. My two older kids are 11 and 8 and we love to play games and we now have a great game that we can play in about a 1/2 hour. This makes it a great game to pull out on weeknights when we don't have time to play a longer game. We have some great 2 player games that play in a similar time frame (Agricola All Creatures, Morels and Jaipur) but up till now no really good 3+ player games that fit into that time span. 

Overall I couldn't be happier with this purchase, my wife and kids love the game, we can play in a 1/2 hour, there is very little downtime and there is a good amount of strategy to be found in this game.[/i]

This game is impossible to explain before playing, which makes it a bit overwhelming for newcomers.  But thankfully it also plays super fast so you can hopefully just let them be confused the first game and follow it up with a second.

I love that this game handles so many people without taking any longer.  And I love drafting.  It is a tad random given the draft selection, so it's hard to truly strategize.  But it's fun anyway.

The components of this game are of truly superior quality.  The artwork is beautiful, and the boards, cards, coins and tokens are very sturdy.  There are similarities in terms of play with Dominion, but 7 Wonders plays faster and is more interactive.  Because of the way the hands are passed continuously around from player to player, the decision as to which card to play on any given turn can be deliciously painful.  There are many different paths to success, which keeps the game exciting and suspenseful, as I find it hard to tell who's winning.  (5+5)

A fun little game, but not anything particularly special. Where it falls short for me is the lightness of the gameplay doesn't really seem to jive with the depth of focus required to play the game well. And since I usually am playing it as a nightcap or filler, I'm not really interested in paying attention to what others are doing, instead of just drafting for my own tableau.

It's certainly not a [i]bad [/i]game, but I'm a long way from being convinced that it is a 'great' or classic game. The main thing holding it back is the lack of planning ahead - it seems to be mainly guessing then crossing your fingers and hoping you get handed the right cards. You literally cannot know if what you are doing is going to turn out well or not. (3 plays).

In short I'd rather play Dominion.

Interesting game - this is one that *really* plays differently depending on who is at the table /and/ where they sit.

Has an interesting choice mechanic where you hand off cards to your neighbours. Can lead to analysis paralysis among some players.  Otherwise turns are quick.

Scoring can be a bit of a chore, especially with the science group.  Also I'm sure those with a good memory for the cards would have an advantage after a time.

I've tried this with a few different groups, getting middling success with a couple of them but one group REALLY liked it.

Certainly a hot game in my groups - through the sheer depth-for-playtime. A lot fitted into a small, quick package. It is wearing a little thin for me, and the games are starting to feel 'samey'. I guess this is a natural function of the fact that you can fit so many games in on a night.

Lived up to expectations.  Very streamlined and pretty fast when playing seven people.  There is a decent strategy still considering it is mostly a crap shoot and light weight game.  The rules and iconography are easy to pick up.  Since not everyone shares my love of race for the galaxy, this is an okay alternative since I really like card drafting.  I was hoping it would be deeper, but regardless it is still fun.

Don't own it but I keep considering picking it up. We just started playing with the Leaders expansion. I think this is my favorite filler game, so favorite that it can easily fill an evening intended for more-serious games. The shiny is wearing off a bit after a few dozen plays at this point, largely because I think the players don't feel like they have a lot of control over their success. I'm not sure you can really get "good" at 7 Wonders, although the puzzle-solving, the low handling time and virtually zero downtime all appeal.

RATING: 8
A really nice ramped up version of Fairy Tale, where hands of cards get passed around, you pick one and play it to your tableau, then pass the rest on. You play out three rounds / decks / hands, with each deck have increasingly better cards. Cards come in a lot more flavours than FT which increases the number of strategies you can try. You tend to play resource cards early as these give you the pre-requisites for building the later bigger scoring cards, which could be straight VPs, sets worth VPs, VPs for specific collections, etc. If you're intent on the win, it has the same "gamble and hope" strategy requirement as FT, eyeing off what the people around you are collecting, going for something else, and then hoping the cards you want come to you drip fed one at a time and not all bunched in one hand, and that other players won't also start collecting them before you. At 30 or 40 minutes I don't mind the lottery feel though, and I've enjoyed each playing. I know it's not going to be dripping with depth, but it's one of those games I'll enjoy whenever pulled out, which may be frequently given it caters beautifully for up to 7 players without downtime.

Hard to know where to put this game.  The rules are very easy for people who play this hobby, it scales well to 7 players and it should play in 30 to 40 mins.

On the other side, players who are not into this hobby will take a bit to 'get it' and I have some concern if the game will get old after a large number of plays.

This is a very solid game and worth getting.

Awesome light-weight Eurogame.

I always play with cities and leaders.  i like it 3 and 5 players.  some say 2-players is broken.  my wife and i play it 2-players all the time and love it - although we did make a minor adjustment to how we pass the cards in the 2-player version, and it plays better.  we pass the free player's whole hand around the circle, just as we would in a regular 3-player game, then take turns playing 1 card from his new hand each turn.  a simple change makes a huge difference. but i know some people are purists and consider rule tweak to be a board gaming sin.

I could play this all day. Modern Classic. Delightful med-light Civ-building card drafting game in less than 60 minutes for 2 to 7 players. Though it is very intensive in the usage of icons, the game is very intuitive when learning how to play; things click after 1 game. Careful management of everything that comes your way, while watching your 2 "neighbors". Different types of gamers seem to enjoy this.

Artwork is good. Design is good. Need a large table space. Need patience to teach this.

2 Player variant is another great Wonder, in my unpopular opinion. I loved it 2 player but my (gamer) wife did not. However, now 7 Wonders Duel fulfills that need for us both.

"Fantastic game for 6-7 since the simultaneous play makes it quick. It's too complex for non-gamers, and has more randomness than I enjoy. I also don't like the hate-drafting. I won't play with 2p, and with 3-5p I'll suggest something else."

What I like:
- Simultaneous play, so quick if people know the game
- No direct attacks
- Resources and "tech trees" are clever
- Civ theme is nice
- Multiple paths to victory

What I don't like:
- Fiddly setup, with cards in or out by player count
- Hard to explain to non-gamers or casual gamers
- Yellow iconology, especially, is tricky
- 2p neutral player sounds horrible
- Almost being forced to hate-draft is annoying
- Randomness can kill you (or hand you the game)

This game shines with 6-7, providing a reasonably meaty experience with quick play time. Unless there are first-timers, in which case it can bog down (90 minutes). Even at 6 I would prefer Peloponnes as a reasonbly-quick; almost-medium civ-themed game.

I have played mostly without Leaders, and twice with. I don't think it adds enough to be worth the little extra time and little extra complexity, but it's ok.

Mechanically I would put the weight at 2.5, while from a depth standpoint maybe 2.2, so the BGG-voted 2.3 is reasonable.

As a Magic player drafting was also a big thing for me. That moment before you get to see your cards is just exciting. 7 Wonders connects that feeling with a beautiful game, which knows how to use cards and boards to build something wonderful.

RATING: 8
A drafting game with enough variety that I'm doing different strategies each game. I have to be flexible as I play, because the as the game goes on, I must change my strategy. Can be played with casual players simultaneously with serious players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very nice card game. The playing time does only slightly increase with more players, therefore it is a perfect game for larger groups which like to play something with more tactical depth than typical party games but a reasonable playing time (definetely below 1h). However I prefer more complex games and I think it is a bit over rated.

This game was mainly created, I suspect, to frustrate people due to its seemingly random nature that can be controlled but ultimately lurks beyond your reach. Much of the time, I'd rather roll some dice and put on a movie than play this game. With the expansions included, it's even more of a blah fest as you wonder whether other people will simply undo you or the cards themselves will simply get shuffled in a way that happens to undo your strategy without providing you a viable way to reform your tableau in a game-winning way.

RATING: 9
This game is great. Fast paced, with almost all decisions interesting, and multiple feasible options. The simultaneous play works amazingly well - you don't have to wait for your opponents, because you're playing at the same time they are!

The short length of the game and the scaling from 3 to 7 players are both very rare features of a game this good. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.5
This game will always have a place in my collection, simply because of how well it scales to the number of players. Plus, I really enjoy the card drafting mechanism and the interesting decisions it forces you to make. Excellent game.

First play was 2 player so not ideal and found some of the cards confusing. Looking forward to mastering the game. 2nd play and we have the turns etc down and now about learning the best cards and strategies. not yet had a three player game which will be a lot better/smoother.

Finally a proper three player game and a victory for me. Loving this game just now.

introduced to my gaming group and another victory for me and they seemed to enjoy it although as per usual, one member got pedantic and we spent 10 mins arguing. nothing new there!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Having now learned and played all of the expansions, including many fan-made expansions, this game continues to be an all-time favorite due to its game play mechanics that work well with 3 to 7 players.  I prefer to play with the Leaders, Cities and Great Projects expansions.  The Babel expansion is like taking 7 wonders and playing it as if you were playing Fluxx.

I like how there are many different paths to victory, but when playing with experienced people winning seems more determined by luck than by how well each person played.

Almost zero downtime, easy to pick up, and can take seven players, would be good to own for those facts alone.

Easy, fast paced. Good filler. Not to much variation though, so don't play too often, I said when I played it a few times, but it has growed on me since then. This is one of few EuropeMasters games I still play after the competition since I started to compete in EuroMasters 2010. It's a perfect end of the evening game especially as it takes up to 7 players.

Excellent drafting game that scaled well across different numbers of players.  The mechanics make your neighbors at the table critical to your success, but also competition you need to be at least a bit wary of.  You've many ways to score (and score well), but you need to keep in mind what the neighbor you'll be passing cards to is doing and whether what you pass them will help them too much.

Beautiful production quality paired with quick play and many options.  Easy to get in a game in an hour, simple to teach, and lots of variety from game to game.

10/29/11 - I am constantly teaching people to play this game and I don't mind because then I can eventually add Leaders. I amazes me when I teach this game, the concerned look people get on their faces because they are thinking the game is difficult. Then they play a age and instantly understand the game and always request to play a second game.

12/11/10 - I enjoyed the mechanics of passing your hand each turn. It made it really hard to figure what cards to play and what you want to bury to avoid helping your neighbors. The art work is spectacular and the game is easy to pick up after a round. The replay factor of this game will be high for me.

RATING: 7
Pretty cool. One 6 player game and went straight into the 2P "Expert" game. I kinda liked the 2p because you manipulate the 3rd "extra" player as hard as you can.

Didn't do me any good though. I still lost.

At the end of both games, I experienced that whole- "I want to go again to see if I can do better" syndrome.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Fast paced and hugely rewarding game, in which the game develops extremely quickly. If you aren't watching your near neighbours closely and other opponents at all then the game can evolve without enough time to combat others, or remove critical choices from them. The choices are endless and there are many paths to collect points to win the game. I love card games and this one is really engaging, the cards are so well put together with all the reference required in symbols.
Can't wait for expansions and for this title to true rank along and fully compete with Dominion as my favourite game that I own.

One of the best card/boardgames i've played! 

The draft mechanic is fun and very well implemented, there's almost no waiting/downtime since the actions are all taken at the same time, and choosing what card to take is very fun as you have to adapt to what other people are playing/taking.

Another nice thing to say is that the game really changes based on the number of people playing, so there's some replayability to be found there.

Highly Recommended.

RATING: 6.5
Yes it plays from 3-7 and yes it can be taught and played in about 30 minutes by almost anyone, but I still do not get all the hype and neither did the other people I played with. It is a light draft style game. You get a hand of seven, chose a card, everyone plays simultaneously and then you pass the cards to a neighbor and repeat. You need to gather resources, build an army, construct your wonder and various other tasks in order to get points. It falls along the lines of Roll Through the Ages, so if you enjoy that game, you will likely enjoy this one. I found it to be a fairly good filler, but not something I would generally play.

The first few times I played this I enjoyed it a lot, but since then I've found the games I have played less and less interesting. This might be the fact that I have started to play many more complex games, but I don't feel like I'm building a civilisation when I play and sometimes I feel like I don't fully understand the consequences of the cards I am taking (this comes from not playing it regularly).Although it plays up to seven, I've found games with more than 4 people a little less interesting as you can only interact with the two people either side of you and you don't get to see the same sets of cards multiple times, which takes away from the strategy.

This game is not everyone's cup of tea and some may be burned out on it, but it is a versatile and essential game to have in my collection.  For a "pick and pass" drafting game I prefer Notre Dame, but there are many situations where 7 Wonders is the perfect game to pull out.

Gioco letteralmente snobbato allo Spiel 2010, a causa del girone infernale attorno allo stand della Repos e anche per la mia bassa soglia di sopportazione nei confronti dei giochi da carte.

Giocato a Play 2011, l'ho comprato subito. Che cantonata che ho preso a Essen! Dove lo ritrovi un gioco, che non sia un party game, che mette a sedere sette persone, facile da spiegare, che dura poco e che scala da dio?

Regole semplicissime ma azzeccate, meccaniche dei commerci e delle guerre ben calate nell'ambientazione (praticamente giochi contro le tue due civiltà confinanti), possibilità di fare combo interessanti e di vincere con le strategie più disparate... cosa vuoi di più da un gioco la cui spiegazione delle regole dura quanto la prima partita?

Dopo qualche partita è un po' ripetitivo, certo, ma comunque un successo strameritato.

Fun game that I haven't played in a while. Works fantastically with more players due to the drafting mechanic keeping things from slowing down. Need to break this out some more now that we frequently have 5 players.

Great with 4-7 players and plays in about 30 minutes.  One of my favorite tier 2 games for people new to the hobby.  Some people complain about the minimal interaction, but I like the level.  I also enjoy the element of constantly adapting tactics as you see what cards are available and the strategies of your neighbors.  A bit difficult to teach to non-gamers as there is a bunch of symbology and the point-salad nature can make it a bit confusing.

As a filler-type card game with a little depth, 7 Wonders is a far better choice than Dominion for me.  I appreciate more good games with the Fairy Tale-style drafting mechanic, and I really appreciate being able to play with 7 people without increased downtime or chaos.  That said, it's still a filler-type card game, so it's still pretty random and will not satisfy the desire to play even a medium-weight Euro.  Basically, I wish it had more depth and less randomness, but as a filler that can accommodate a lot of people, this is a winner.

Kind of glad I didn't buy this so far, but with repeated plays, it might change a bit. Really, this feels exactly like fairy tale just with prettier pictures.

Edit: After quite a few plays, this game settles on a 6 rating. The biggest appeal of the game is 7 players in under 45 minutes and that really just doesn't do it for me. It's a solid game but not really a whole lot of substance. I'd willing to play it each time it comes out, but I'm not actively seeking it.

Edit2: After playing it again after a long while, I still enjoy the game. I'm not actively seeking to buy it or play it, but I'd definitely play it if asked. A nice filler that can be played relatively quickly if everyone is on their game.

One of my all time favorite board games. Simple gameplay, as you just draft and play 18 cards, but not simplistic, as it can go as deep as you want to, in terms of tactics. It scales perfectly, in terms of time with many people and it can be very fun, especially if the group likes teasing and table talking.

I can play it either as a filler or as the main game of the night and I'm always willing to hop in, so a perfect 10 from me.

Excellent card-drafting games (one of the best). After the first play(s) it feels very intuitive, not too much cards to remember what can be in play. Nice progression through the rounds. Interesting neighbour mechanic (you trade and fight only with the players next to you), which creates sort of zones around the table. And maybe most important, different possibilities to win, different strategies to choose from. Best with 5-7 players.

Perhaps a bit hasty. The intitial grade was just right. I have played this a lot now. It's qucik, easy, pleasant and addictive.. but not overly exciting. Seems like nitpicking and downright silly changing a games grade back and forth half a notch. But still, 7.5 it is..

It would be interresting to see if more expansions beside the Manneken Pis will emerge, maybe new cards perhaps..  

***

Small uppgrade to 8. Several more plays, a couple of 6-player games as well. This is my new and meatier Ticket to Ride.

***

Nice game. One 3-player and one 4-player game so far. Played it with my oldest daughters (8 and 12 years) and they seem to get it soon enough. They also liked that the game played pretty quick. 

The icons weren't hard to learn, it is nothing like "Race for the Galaxy" (which I did not care for).

It's easy to play this game 2-3 times during a game night even if you're playing multiple games thanks to the quick play time. I also love being able to buy things from your neighbors where you actually pay them to use some of their resources, this is fun and addictive. I strongly recommend picking up the Leaders expansion with it.

Love this game and how quick it is even with 7 players. 

Mostly play with 3 to 4 players and working on that strategy. The rules might be a bit abstract for a beginning gamer but the nomenclature of the cards is quite well thought out.

RATING: 8
Good game, for sure. Always fast paced regardless of group size, but the symbols are a pain to teach. The quick reference is good though, and things are easy to remember after a play or two even for non-boardgamers.

I think replay value is lower than I like, but I don't see myself vetoing it anytime soon.

I never tire playing this game.  It has many interesting choices and good interaction. I like the city building/technology development.  It's easy to teach, plays fast, and still has enough depth for gamers.

The main issue is that it's more tactical and not as strategic, as you cannot plan ahead, since you don't know which cards you'll receive.

Glad I got this game. If I'm having this much fun with 2 players, I can only imagine how much better it is without the dummy.

Update: I still really think this is a good design. I like it best with 2 or three people because there's maximum interaction that way, but it's still competent up to its max. 

Update: Many, many games later and I'm starting to get tired of it. It's still a good game, but the functions of the buildings are very lackluster.

Świetna mechanika równoczesnych wyborów pośród graczy nie pozawala się nikomu nudzić. Rundy lecą szybko i ciekawie, po każdym przekazaniu kart podejmujemy decyzję na podstawie własnej strategii jak i też strategii innych. Interakcja w grze sprowadza się do 3 konfliktów militarnych z sąsiadmi oraz do wzajemnego podbierania kart. Mimo brzmienia nie ma ona specjalnie negatywnego charakteru.

Świetnie zrównoważona gra, atrakcyjna wizualnie, zawsze stanowi wyzwanie.
Polecam z dodatkami.

Nawet 70 grach daje się w to grać, jest w tym nieco więcej automatu ale nadal spoko.

Great game with tough decisions every single turn.  Several paths to victory but the science cards do seem to outweigh the other paths.  However; if the players choose to team up a bit against someone taking the science path and black hole their cards you can stop that.  

Just a really intriguing game with a ton of re-playability.

RATING: 7
One of the games that got me into the hobby. A civilization builder that plays in about a half hour, 7 Wonders works well for three to seven players without adding nearly any time for higher player counts. The slightly lower rating is just from having played (over-played) it so much.

Great Game,  we run with all the expansions most of the time.   This is always one of the first games I turn to when playing with new gamers.  The play-ability of 7 Wonders is great,  you can play the same strategy or try something different.  Adding the expansion adds even more play-ability to this great game

Well this game certainly lived up to its hype. Extremely good for what it is. Plays fast and scales really well. Very fun "filler" game. My wife and extended family really enjoy it! 

The game is elegant in it's design. It's simple and quick to learn but, has some depth for a 30min game.

I do wish the games card stock was of a higher quality. It also would have been nice to have a reference card for all the players, to make those first games go easier.

An excellent drafting, civilisation building experience that supports up to 7 players seamlessly with very little down-time (if any).

I enjoy playing 7 Wonders with people who have played it before, but people who claim that this is a great gateway game and one that is easy to teach are full of it.

The card-drafting, dozens of icons, spending resources that you retain permanently, and using the cards in myriad Chudyk-like ways make for a very steep learning curve for a lot of players new to the hobby. Although it's simple for gamers to play and not incredibly deep, this does not make it a good game to teach to your in-laws over a holiday weekend.

RATING: 6
This feels like a re-implementation of Knizia's Ra, but I prefer Ra.

The artwork in 7 Wonders is amazing and there is enough historical flavor to inspire learning about the leaders - so that is a plus. The game plays quickly which is also a plus. Passing the hand of cards around the table is an interesting mechanic.

On the negative side, scoring at the endgame is clunky. Player interaction could be better. I can buy a resource, get points off of your tableau, make you pay a debt, get or lose points militarily or try to deny you cards going around the table that you might need. That seems like a lot of stuff to do to the players on your right and left, except it didn't feel like I was seriously planning in that manner, but rather just playing the best card in my hand.

My main complaint is that there are too many symbols in 7 Wonders needlessly complicating the learning curve.

I prefer the uncertainty of when the resources will be available and when the Epochs will end in Ra.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Quite simple civilization-building game. All in all I found this game a bit dull. No really any interesting mechanics and drafting doesn't fit in this game... Symbols are quite weird occasionally and thus uninformative. 

It was nice to try this but I wouldn't play this on a professional level. Not that I would any other game.

Subjective: -0.5 Now this is just my opinion, but the game is a bit too fluffy and light after repeated plays.  It just doesn't quite have the meat I need to make it hit the table with my gamer buddies again and again, but with children and non-gamers it fires on all cylinders.

This game is the best game I purchased this year in 2011, and it was an impulse buy.  Bottom line, it is worth purchasing, whatever your game group and/or style of play.  It's just that good.

1/12/12 - It's been a while since I've played it but it's still my wife's favorite game. Once you get over the many (but easy to understand) symbols then this game becomes second nature and flows really well. It plays 7 players and games are really quick. Awesome game. I'm going to have to play it again soon.

7/15/12 - The family has grown to like this game and it's something we can all play quickly. Unfortunately they forget a lot of the rules and the iconography can get a little intimidating for someone who doesn't play often. I purchased the Leaders expansion but have yet to play it with them. The simultaneous turn and the city building are my favorite parts of the game.

Great little card game -- you're collecting resources to build wonders and buildings and amass victory points. I really like having so many choices strategy wise and that the game forces you to be very observant of what the players to your left and right are doing. I'll be interested to see how much replayability this has after we get really familiar with all the cards. So far, so good though!

Great family game for my 4p game group! My brother keeps on wanting another match even though it was almost midnight! A good balanced game with no clear runaway leader problem. The perfect mix of strategy/depth and randomness gets a thumb up from me.

---- Update ----
My sister-in-law prefers this game over Dominion because she feels less "screwed" by my brother simply because the card drafting mechanic makes it less obvious in the sense that someone works against you. In Dominion, attack cards are more direct and personal.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A useful game in a game collection because it copes with a wide range of player numbers (2-7, 2-8 with cities) and doesn't get much longer as you add players because of the simultaneous decision making and play.
The depth is ok for the game length (45-60 mins) but the game is long for a filler and short for the main game of an evening however it provides me with an alternative to playing Dominion in this slot.
An alternative would be Nefarious but this has better acceptability with the people that I game with.
I consider one of the expansions essential, not because of the extended game time, extra complexity or the 8th player but because even without using the expansion cards, you can fit the entire game into the expansion box and make it much more portable.
For this reason, buying both expansions is probably a mistake.
Update: after 50 plays to run time is down to 30 minutes including setup and tear down and this has enough depth to be the default end of evening filler. We almost never play with any expansions, except the extra Wonders.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
7 Wonders has got a bit of an initial rules-explanation investment, and the cards get more complicated (resulting in more questions, not fewer, as the game goes on), but ultimately it's a fairly light game.  Yet for all that I enjoyed it a lot, as there are a lot of different directions to go, and there seems to be enough variation to make it interesting for at least the first several plays.  Beyond that I refuse to make a prediction.

I always enjoy playing it, and yet it's so different and kind of tricky to teach (and, by extension, to remember all the various little facets) that I can't see suggesting it, though I'd gladly play it if someone else were willing to take the initial heat for teaching newbies' first plays.

I want to give it a shout out because it actually works with 6 or (mirabile dictu!) 7, without a substantial addition of downtime or waiting to resolve your own turn.  Most tactical games of this sort can play 6 or 7 only by adding time, but 7 Wonders, by limiting concerns to one's neighbors, pulls it off.  Of course, this limits one's impact on the rest of the players, changing the game a bit, but that's a trade I'll gladly make.

Great game! The drafting mechanic on every turn means that there is no down time at all, no matter how many players there are. It is also interactive as what you play/your score depends on the cards played by the people on either side of you. This is a great game for a large group of people. The 2-player version, however, was much less enjoyable. We both had to build two wonders (two wonders for each of us and two dummy wonders) and it became quite confusing. We spent almost as much time deciding what to play for the dummy hand as we did our own. So - great game overall but not for two players.

A really excellent game-- mandatory to own if you enjoy drafting.

Frankly in my opinion, people who undervalue this game are failing to understand the depth and nuances of drating.

It is a fun family game that can play very quickly when people know how to play.  The only draw back it this is NOT a strategy game, it's a make the best with what you got game without knowing what you are going to be getting.  Still, there is some planning ahead that you can do, but with this game - in the end - I feel it mostly comes down to luck (getting the right cards at the right time)

Great game that pleases both gamers and non gamers.

Maybe a bit much of luck involved as you do need one game to know what you're doing... but apparently that doesn't keep you from winning (from a play session with a complete casual).

No interesting or hard decisions.

This is a fine introductory family game, for large families. But it not much good beyond that. It's really more of an activity, as the the game doesn't present players with any tough or interesting decisions. You just go through the motions. Also, the purple cards seem especially good. Despite these faults, many people seem to enjoy it

The game plays very straight forward and the level of complexity depends on who you are playing against. Would have scored higher for me if there were more things to build and an easier way to tally up the player scores. It seems after the game has ended, everyone liked the game so much nobody cared to know what the score was. That says a lot about a game I think.

Great civilization building game that uses a drafting mechanic. Planning your strategy based on what you get is tricky, but in the end you can do some good work on this. Some wonders seem to be better than others, but then again, this might be due to the different hands you get over time. The two player option works quite fine, and I will use it so I can play with my wife. Unfortunately, the production of the cards is not what you would want for something that gets so much manipulation. I am getting sleeves for this game, as I am sure if I do not many of the cards will be broken soon.

Seven Wonders has been on the market for about a year now. It arrived with much fanfare and lived up to the hype by receiving numerous "Game of the Year" awards. What makes Seven Wonders so appealing is that it does everything well and some things very well. For starters, it fittingly accommodates up to seven players, and games only take 30 to 45 minutes. This combination is unheard of outside of the party games genre. On top of that, it has solid game mechanics, excellent artwork and a great theme.

Each player is the ruler of a civilization and must not only build one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, but also develop their city and protect its borders. The many necessities of a civilized society place great demands on your limited resources. Economy, education, culture, government, technology, military, and of course the completion of that magnificent wonder all need to be addressed. It sounds like an awful lot to accomplish in a 30 to 45 minute card game, but it works quite well.

The game mechanics are what makes Seven Wonders such a unique game. It doesn't really introduce anything groundbreaking, but instead combines familiar mechanics in a way that makes the game quite versatile. Everyone takes their turns at the same time by playing cards from a hand that changes each turn. Each card represents a building that provides benefits such as natural resources, manufactured goods, money, military strength, and points. What you choose to build depends on what you can afford and what fits into your strategy. There are several paths to victory - will you invest heavily in science, build a robust economy, or crush your opponents with your army? (Mind you, no actual battles take place, and like practically every European game, no one is ever eliminated.).  With that being said this is a very good game that I would recommend to anyone.

I like this game, since it is easy to play, plays quickly, is fun and the whole family can play.  There are many possible strategies and you need to be flexible enough to deal with the particular set of cards that come your way each turn.  This is short enough to be a great filler, but we usually play two or three games in a row, since it is so much fun.

RATING: 8
This is essentially a drafting game. What you pick changes what is available to others and what they pick changes what is available to you. If you like the process of draft for Magic: the Gathering you will like this game.

The game comes with a two player variant but it really isn't worth playing. You will need at least three people for this game. Because everyone takes turns at the same time, there is little down time. This game really shines with lots of players. I recommend playing this game with 7 people if possible.

Also to understand how this game works you should do a practice run. Meaning the first time you play you won't have any clue what is going on, but the second time everything will make perfect since (or at least that has been my experience when I learned and when I teach others).

All in all a solid game with lots of replay ability especially if you have a large and varied play group.

RATING: 8
Drafting game that plays up to 7 players by adding more cards at higher player counts. Since all players only interacts with their immediate neighbors to the left and right, the game does not vary significantly in length regardless of player count. The drawback is that the more players there are, the greater the risk of getting duplicate cards which can't be drafted to play, since you can't have two cards with the same name in your tableau. Although they can be exchanged for money, I like this at the lower player counts.

The two player game is solid but uses a dummy player that the players alternate drafting cards for. For me it works just fine, but many seem to prefer 7 Wonders Duel for two player games.

After trying higher player counts, my preference would probably be in the lower range of players, 2-4. The reasons are that at the higher player counts, there are multiple copies of the same card. Since you can only ever have one card with the same name, the second card would be useless unless you can squirrel it away in your wonder. At lower player counts you will also have the chance to see the same hand more than one time.

The value to 7 Wonders is in its short game time, depth without too much complexity, and ability to handle a good number of players without significant down time. If the game took any more time to play than it does or was any more complex I probably wouldn't like it; fortunately, it hits the sweet spot.
Its ease of entry, taking only a little more instruction than a casual game and can be taught to non-gamers fairly easily, makes this a nice game to break out in a non-hardcore gaming group or inbetween games. There is strategy to your choices so gamers who prefer heavier games can still enjoy it. Since you don't invest a lot of time into it you don't feel like you need much more.

RATING: 7
A gamers' filler. Short, scales up to 7. Like a magic booster draft without the actual play. Nice, clean, pretty design. However, too transparent to offer much depth or replayability, even with the variable powers and double-sided boards.

For some, it might have a perfect game weight. I fear that for me, it's too complex for a quick family-type filler and too simple for a satisfying gamers' experience. Somewhat similar to Citadels (in that regard), but with less player interaction and a much shorter playing time.

Update: Not a game that interests me anymore as just too busy graphically with the optimal 4 players.

First play with 3 was interesting as I noticed that as you see your diminishing hand of cards 3 times and both your opponents twice, if you could/care to memorise the contents of each hand you could set yourself for efficient card play (unless your passing neighbour denies you that desired card). So with more players means the loss of this aspect (which triggers the mastery instinct that drives the need for a repeat play). 

Yet the fact that upto 7 players can be 'interested' simultaneously is one reason for 7 Wonders inclusion in many game collections.But the more I play it with 3 or 4 the less convinced I need to go on the ride with more players and not using all the cards seems a waste.

Really? This is the game that has garnered (undeservedly, in my opinion) so much hype. It qualifies as the ultimate BGG 6 rating: "some fun" and "may play sporadically" mostly because it moves (and is over) quickly. Too much iconography for casual gamers; not enough strategy for gamers. Will play as a filler while waiting for others to finish their longer game. Not interested in buying. 

Still baffled by its meteoric rise in the rankings here. Is it because of a shift in the core demographics of the BGG user? Not that that is a bad thing... I mean if this can sell over 10,000 copies maybe I can make some money on my new game, "Fart in a Box"

Lowered my rating to 3.0 after 8 months. Still have not played it again. Every time I see it being pulled out I make some excuse to make a quick exit. I think my last one was that I had to have razor blades inserted into my pancreas.

Great strategy game.  It is always your turn and you always have to be thinking which could be good or bad depending on your preference.  You concentrate and plan and make selections that earn points developing one of a few possible strategies with only indirect interaction between players.  At the end you add up the points and see who did it best.  If that sounds like fun then they do that very well and you'll love it.

To a certain extent I'm just tired of this game, after 18 plays. I like the simple drafting mechanism, but this game's icons are really hard to understand, which undercuts the enjoyable simplicity. Especially when the leader's expansion is included. The game also gets less interactive the more players you involve, but with fewer players the cards get less interesting. The method of scoring the green science cards feels needlessly complicated in comparison to the rest of the game. I sold this game and it's expansions when I came to realize that I got the same positive feelings from playing a quick round of Sushi Go, as I did from a lengthy play of this game, but it didn't come with all the stuff I didn't like.

I like it, but I feel like there's something missing.  It is great for groups, because there's always something to force interaction.  Guess I'd enjoy it more if there was something to actually DO after the draft was over besides math.

:thumbsup: Hard-pressed to think of things I like about this game. I keep it because I can see getting some value out of it once my sons are old enough to learn it, years from now. 

:thumbsdown: To begin with, I find the 2-player variant very awkward. It's only worth bringing out with 3 or more players. I find the player interaction lacking and the decisions flat. However, for such a one-dimensional game, it fails as a gateway for having so many icons and categories of cards to explain. It's a pain to teach, or maybe I just find it to be a pain because I don't care for the game. This could definitely be a case of perhaps finding more to the game after repeated play but I never hit upon anything intriguing enough to motivate me. Unlike other games, I don't get a feel that I am building anything in particular as much as simply maximizing points.

Tolles Spiel für jede Gruppengröße und für Viel- und Wenigspieler. Die Wunder sehen grandios aus, sind vollkommen ausgeglichen und geben zwar die strategische Route vor, lassen aber dennoch Spielraum für eigene Strategien und Kniffe.

The first thing to say about 7 Wonders is that it is really just Fairy Tale with more appealing artwork and some additional wrinkles. That's not a problem as Fairy Tale is a great filler and the wrinkles are improvements. But don't come here expecting a meaty card game of the like of Race for the Galaxy or Glory to Rome. Where this game really excels is allowing seven players to play something with a little more substance than 6 Nimmt in 20-30 minutes. That's achieved by the clever breaking down of the game into subgames between you and your two neighbours. There's really no need to look across the table as you'll only be buying resources from and scoring points based on the players to either side of you. The speed is achieved by having nearly everything happen simultaneously; I was amazed by the lack of downtime. But I probably won't be buying this. There are going to be copies everywhere anyway, and I suspect replayability will be limited until the inevitable Dominion-style expansions start appearing.

This game is a tableau-builder which uses an innovative draft and pass mechanism that keeps all players engaged at all times. And that is the only positive. It should honestly get a 2 or 3 rating, but due to sponsor deals, it's at least a thousand places ahead of where it belongs on the hit parade here, so I downvote as hard as I possibly can.

Before you start, setup is a nightmare, requiring specific cards to be stripped or added from each of three age-specific decks depending on the number of players. Heaven forfend somebody wants to back out or join in while you "haven't started yet"  

Once you start, you will have no idea what you are doing, and the age-specific nature of cards means that there is no making up for missed opportunities later.

As something like a parody of a Eurogame, strategy is in fact impossible, since you cannot know your own nor anybody else's score during play, so you have no clue who you should be cooperating with and who you should be working against and are playing this as a solo optimization problem.

When you get to the end, you will have people pull out their mobile devices to run the scoring algorithm. Call me old fashioned, but a game that requires a spreadsheet to score should not be a non-digital game. Scoring literally involves 7 different types of set collection counting, some of which are additive, some of which are subtractive and some of which involve square roots. I'd dismiss it as "point salad", but that's sorry cliche and most people can make salads quicker than they can tabulate their score in this game.

A fine game, but the decisions involved aren't deep enough for the amount of time it takes and how fiddly it is. I like that everyone plays simultaneously, so it doesn't have much down time.

The best game for company. Regardless of the number of players, it will take about 35 minutes or less per game. Easy to learn, addictive, and fun with 7 players.  If you have mixed company between those who like board games and those who do not, 7 Wonders and Ticket to Ride are good compromises.

This is a cool and balanced game. There are multiple ways to approach it and with equal experience players becomes very challenging. I gave it only a 7.5 because it has a low re-playability, after the group learns the cards and the synergies it becomes less fun and more mechanical actions.

I love this game so much.  I love the drafting mechanic, and even though that's mostly all this is, it manages to feel substantially deeper and more replayable than you might at first think.  I'm so impressed with all of the paths to victory available to you in this game.

But more than anything else, the quick play time and fact that you can play with 3-7 players and still have an excellent game, makes this game amazing for just about any situation.  Much more satisfying than a simple filler game, this game is great for almost any situation.

I like the card drafting style, where you should consider what you pick in relation to your immediate neighbors. 
While a nice mechanic it cannot carry the game by itself.

It does give the feel that you are building something - perhaps not the whole civilization experience, but something. 

Scales well since almost all play is simultaneous, and your primary interaction is your immediate neighbors.

A very quick game that's speed is unaffected by the number of players, as everyone plays simultaneously. Can have up to 8 players with an expansion but that said, it's still a better game with fewer players. 

Interaction is limited to the players on your left and right, which can feel a little isolating when in a larger group, but the expansion Babel (which I don't have) is supposed to help with that issue.

RATING: 7.3
[ESP] Buen juego que su mayor cualidad es poderlo a jugar hasta 7 jugadores (8 con expansión) sin aumentar el tiempo de juego. Como contra es precisamente esa cualidad que hace que en mesas grandes sea una de las primeras opciones, y aunque no es complicado si hay muchos jugadores novatos o con AP puede hacer que se tarde la partida.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
No rating yet because I've only played with 3 players. I really like a lot of the design decisions they made Rewarding players for defensively drafting three cards through the course of the game is a great way to make meddling with your opponents' plans a viable strategy, they somehow manage to make drafting a red-colored card feel like an act of war, and the mandatory trading of resources makes drafting resource cards a really interesting decision. Some say that the green cards ruin the game, but my gut tells me they need to find a better green strategy. I'd like to try this with more players to get the full experience of the game.

Edit: Tried with 5 and then with 7, and it was very cool! This really needs more players to work, but when it does, it's exactly what you want to bring to the table when you need something quick for 4-7 midrange-skill gamers.

Edit: I just played a session with half-new players, half-veterans, and that dynamic caused some weird things to happen. I understand this is a problem in most games, but it's even worse here, because veterans can't even help new players or give them advice without looking at packs they're not supposed to look at. We finished, and the game was alright, but this one really loses a lot when players of different experience levels play. Use with caution.

This is one of the best new games I have played in a long time.  It plays quickly, there is no dead time, there are a ton of decisions, and multiple ways to play and win.  I do not think that you can play one strategy every time and be successful.  You have to watch what the players on your left and right are doing and adapt accordingly.  You also have to work with the cards that come to you.  It is a very enjoyable game.

RATING: 7
My biggest beef with this game is that there's no solid way to interact at all with something somebody across the table is doing in a 5+ player game. I can't affect them via military, can't trade resources, etc. Obviously hate-drafting things is a pseudo-interaction, but it rarely makes that big of a difference, especially since most of the pack will be gone by the time it gets to them anyway. Most of the time I feel like I'm playing a game with the people on my left and right, and there's a nebulous "other player(s)" that I have to make sure I beat in points as well.

That said, the game itself is solid on mechanics. I do enjoy playing, and (especially with people who know what they're doing) playtime is quick.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.25
A nice variant of efficiency engine games with a bit more possible interaction due to trading, military and victory points based on opponents' buildings.

WOW!!!!! This game is Definitly deserving of its rank on Boardgame geek!!! This is the type of game that allows a player to use lesser strategy tactics on other players, resource managment, and a huge alternating gameplay with different wonders that force a player to think in a differnt way. I enjoyed being forced to think in different ways based on the wonder I had. I first started with the Statues of Zues on Olympus and that went rather well (I came in 2nd out of 4, by 1 point)(it is an easy card to build and doesn't mess with the build up and conquer theory most Warcraft III & Command and Conquer players are used to. THen I got the Rhodes (colosseus) and got my ass handed to me since I was a build up the forces and send the horde type of player and now i was to focus more on resouces than fighting and got waxed by everyone. I then played Babylon and won that game by 1 point out of the 4 and was interested in the Guilds and building structures not so much in armies or money. That was a cool game for sure.

I would STRONGLY recommend this game to anyone who likes a light game with a mild strategy mixed in. It is well deserving of its high marks and love it gets. True quality and Fantastic Artwork makes this game a must have for everyone.

Really enjoy this one, my favorite game so far. There's a bit to learn, but instructions do a good job. The game plays quickly no matter the number of players since everyone can play their turn at the same time. Drafting is a really interesting mechanic which presents a lot of tough choices despite a short game length.

June 2017: Wow, one slow player can totally ruin this game! I had no idea how incredibly fast this game can play!

Still rate it a 4.

Feb 2011: At least it's fast.

I take that back. If you include setup, rule explanation, and tear down, you have *doubled* the time it takes to play this game.

Yet another VP engine, low interaction, resource management game. And as with many "light" Euro games, way too bloated rules-wise.

I've never had a game that I was more neutral about.  If someone wants to play, I'll play.  But this is more of an activity than a game.  I like drafting but I think many people like it so much that they don't really look at the gameplay of what they are drafting for.

RATING: 10
One of the best games ever, and also one of the great next step games (games after the gateway ones). We really enjoyed it a lot and the only negative is the iconography that may present a high learning curve for some new boardgamers. Overall a 9.5 for me. Upped from 9.0.

[Updated: After more than 100+ plays and the added expansions, this becomes a 10 for me. The negativity with 5 players and up (and with 2) is compensated with the very high replayability as I am experiencing right now. Been playing for more than 4 months now at the rate of about 10 games a week and still addicting, engrossing and exciting game.]

I feel that the civ theme still survives the somewhat abstract nature of the game mechanics.  It's very accessible to all levels of gamers; I enjoy playing with advanced gamers as well as kids.  I think there's a lot of strategic space to explore, and I've tried, and won, with multiple strategies.  Though I will say winners tend to be those that focus on science or politics...military seems to be a losing prospect.  The game's relatively quick and easy to grasp, thus making it a go-to game.

To be completely fair to this game, I would have initially ranked it a 9.  In fact, I think I did.  Out of the gate, this game is a blast.  What did this game in for me was, essentially, figuring it out.  We played this game over and over when I first got it, and the gameplay eventually became rote.  The expansions do a nice job of adding new wrinkles and replayability, but only for so long.  I still enjoy playing this game when a larger group (6 or 7) gets together.  Especially if it includes people who aren't super-into board games, but I won't reach for this game if I'm the one picking.  I'd rather play Time's Up if it's a casual group, or Among the Stars if it's a more gamer-y group.

Another excellent family gaming experience. It sets up and plays quickly. Is it as thematically deep, mentally taxing and intellectually satisfying as a complex war game? No. But my family enjoys it, it's smooth and moves well, and it actually gets played. That's worth an 8 to me.

RATING: 7
It fills a niche, given that it is pretty simple to teach and play, and copes equally well whether you have 3 players or 7.

But quite quickly every game starts to feel the same.  There just isn't any great depth or variety to this game.  In short, it's a very long way from deserving the hype IMO.

Played three games so far and really liked it once I got the hang of it.  It was my first card drafting game, so that may have made the learning curve higher than it should have been.  My 8 year old played it and enjoyed it as well. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Game is really smooth and fast. Offers multiple paths to victory but avoids a lot of the AP that similar strategy games encounter due to the card drafting mechanic. I've seen people win using all the different methods which is what you want to see.

There is definitely a little bit of a learning curve for new players but once you get the basics it is straightforward. Card Icons are very easy to understand and provide the necessary info.

Great replay value due to the random starting player boards and selection of available cards. Plays well with almost all player counts and I enjoy the 2-player variant just as much as the other player counts.

The upside:
-It's light, there's plenty of eye-candy, and the player count puts this as an great choice for a party game.
-The drafting mechanism is nothing new, but it's always fun solution.

The downside:
-Didn't grab me and I found myself caring less and less with the outcome of my decisions throughout the game.

RATING: 5
A fine gateway game for introducing your non-gaming friends to medium-light strategic thinking.  
7 Wonders doesn't overstay it's welcome, but still gives the feeling of having achieved something when played well.

However, clunky endgame book keeping and a general lack of depth or player interaction prevent this from being much more than an introduction to drafting, and a gateway the board-gaming world.

1st play was VERY impressive.
Plays from 2-7 (?!) - that's amazing!
Little downtime, and many decisions lead to a very enjoyable game that only takes 1 game to "get".
Want to play again, soon.
After more plays, with long delays between - it is difficult for me to remember the rules and iconography. Similar to RftG, I find myself having to re-learn the game over and over again. That is REALLY annoying, and more trouble than I'm willing to go through for gaming nowadays.

7 Wonders gives me a critical choice each turn in picking my card, but this choice is always scripted and boring.  There are no consequences for poor play; I'm not really sure skill has anything to do with it.  Instead, it is a little engine that sorts cards and uses my time as fuel.  The high rating reflects only the fantastic design, a machine that will not break down, and it accommodates 7 players which means it sees the table whenever there is indecision about what to play at group.

LOL it is a game for the indecisive.

A hand drafting/resource management game. Easy setup and quick gameplay allows multiple games in a short span of time.

Splendido gioco, veloce, capace di unire in un tavolo fino a sette giocatori e alla portata di tutti. Questo è il segreto di 7 Wonders! A spiegarlo sembra complesso ma la naturalezza con cui lo si gioca mostra quanto sia in realtà intuitivo. Scalabilità altissima e durata sempre contenuta grazie alle giocate in contemporanea. Un "cardgame" travestito da "boardgame". Bellissima la dinamica di passaggio carte, bellissime le plance e le carte da gioco. Poco meno di un "giocone" di alta strategia molto più di un "filler". Tra gli aspetti negativi, se proprio vogliamo trovarli, c'è sicuramente la poca interazione con chi non è seduto vicino, ma che rispecchia effettivamente la poca influenza che civiltà lontane possono avere tra loro. Uno dei giochi più belli mai provati. Belle anche le sue espansioni Cities (principalmente aggiunge le carte nere), Pack (quattro nuove plance) e quelle scaricabili da internet (soprattutto le plance) fatte dagli appassionati di questo gioco. Uno dei giochi che non deve assolutamente mancare nella Ludoteca Ideale!!! International Gamers Award... 2011.

RATING: 3
So, uhm, Never play this game.  No, Not even then. Card drafting and Resource management is not the end of the world, but when the people to your right and left can limit what you can do with their choices as well, Then you have a player sitting there doing nothing worth doing.  Don't design a game that encourages me to not bother playing since I'll never get a effective choice.    I get that I have to chose to adopt a couple of strategies to focus on rather than trying to branch out, But when my opponent can clearly see what the goals of my society are before I even play, that gives them too much power to stop those goals from ever happening, even if they have different goals than mine for their society. I suppose I could choose goals my society wouldn't normally have, and screw theirs over, but I couldn't seem to effectively withhold enough cards from them in the drafting.  It's just an hour plus of "hey,you get to eat Crap."  Sucks. I have two words for this game: P and U.

I'm a sucker for quick-playing, medium-light, tactical games, and 7 Wonders hits that spot perfectly. There's low downtime, so you're constantly making interesting decisions, and if you mess up, it's over in half an hour and you can try again! The price of this is that strategic depth is lacking, but I don't mind.

Woah...addictive. Can see where the hype is coming from. Some really nice mechanics (changing hands being the best) that makes it shine. Similar to St Petersburg or Stone Age, in that you pick a scoring strategy and hope you get the cards to make it work. Rating is high as it is a terrific game for 30 mins. 

UPDATE: Played this a couple of dozen times and have won or done well in a variety of different strategies. There is one maxim though: build stuff for free. It's great.

One of my favourites at the moment. I like the empire building flavour in a game that doesn't take hours to play, love the random elements (luck of which wonder, which cards) with strategic play, the production values are great - and it is a game that is still fun with six or seven players - no waiting around for your turn. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2
So much to like about this game.
- It can handle up to 7 players.
- It's a fairly fast game, once everyone knows how to play.  I have personally completed several games in less than 20 minutes, when playing with experienced players.  Plus the game time doesn't increase significantly by adding more players.
- The game is really easy to explain.  I usually just explain the simplest rules in a couple minutes, and then have new players ask questions in the middle of a game.  Additionally, my 7 year old son has played this game, and has almost defeated me several times already.
- I love the fact that the game has almost no downtime, because of the simultaneous card drafting mechanic.  I'm surprised more games haven't taken advantage of this mechanic.
- It has a decent amount of strategy, although your strategy is typically locked down into a certain track by Age III.
- Replayability is huge.  You can always try different civilizations and different card drafting strategies, depending on what your first couple hands show.
- There are expansions to add to game variety.

That's a lot to say, but I really love this game.  One of my favorites, for sure.

RATING: 7
School game.

A lot of fun to play and deceptively simple - I was initially put off by all the iconography, but needn't have been. The game gives a really good sense of development and it satisfies the civ-building itch that I want to scratch more frequently than most. On the downside, I feel that the game plays itself to a large extent. 90% of the decisions are no-brainers and those that aren't don't feel critical or agonising. Despite this negative, I will still welcome the opportunity to play. It is slick and fast and the theme appeals.

Unlike most games 7 Wonders scales exceptionally well with any player count (up to seven, of course); because of this it is a game I often break out with a large group.

7 Wonders is a light card drafting game at it's core. Thought and strategy are required for an edge in game play, but the overall nuts and bolts of the game are exceptionally easy to grasp. Recommended for new/casual gamers. That said, there is enough meat here to keep a serious player satisfied.

RATING: 10
Just a flat out great game.  It's tons of fun to play and with little or no language on the cards it's very easy to bring to a multi-lingual crowd.  The mechanics are fun, the set up is random which helps prevent meta-strategy, but also keeps consistent.  There are several paths to victory and the layout allows you to block others' paths on the way to yours.  Interaction is minimal but your choices affect everyone in the game.  This adds a lot of tension without the game being a friend-ender.  

The only downside is that this game is a bit of a table hog.  For anything larger than a 3 payer game get a larger table or play on the floor.  

Also don't bother with the 2 player variant.  Buy Duels if you want to do two players.  This game wasn't designed for 2 players so the 2 player rules are just kind of silly.  

Other than those things there nothing negative I can say.  It's beautifully drawn, and obvious that the designers put a lot work and effort into every detail of the game.  Great work Mr. Bauza and crew!

The two player variant is MUCH better than expected - my wife and I have a lot of fun with this one trying different strategies.  In fact, the two player version is actually deeper due to the strategy used when you play for the Free City (which is a dummy player - but this one WORKS).

The multi-player game is also fantastic and is both easy and fun to play.  Really good for 3 players - which plays really tight, but scales well to greater numbers too.

I like this game!  At first it seemed like it was tough to teach this game to new people (non-gamers) but then I said, "Let's just play!" And it worked. The players at first did not really know what to do, but as they started playing, the rules came to life. Everyone I have played this with has liked it.

Neat card game that requires a few playthroughs to really get the hang of it.
Can be bothersome to explain to others, but they usually get a sense of the game fairly quickly.

After dozens of plays I have no need to revisit this. I can be persuaded into playing it, but that's about it. Considering selling my copy...

7 Wonders is a game that I enjoy more the more I play it. The mechanics are simple but offer a lot of choices. Knowing when to pay someone for their resources or tossing a card for money or build your wonder may seem fairly insignificant, but these little actions add up fast.

Perhaps the game's greatest strength is how fast it plays and how more players (up to 7 or more!) barely increases the playing time. In fact, it's so fast you barely have enough time to stop and look at the beautiful artwork.

I started off not liking 7 Wonders very much, but it has quickly become one of our favorite short games. I highly recommend grabbing an expansion or a couple promos too.

RATING: 8
A good short filler for up to seven people. Colorful and nicely made. Took me a few plays to start to see the interest, and I'm still not sure that it should be ranked as highly as it is; but it's a good, solid game. The two-player variant is surprisingly intricate and almost vicious.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
It's a points-potpourri game, so I always feel like I've lost no matter where I fall in the final game ranking. However, it's great to pull out when we have a lot of people at game night. It plays quickly with players who know the game, and doesn't *have* to be vicious.

Very fun game and plays quick after the initial "teaching" game. I've only played with groups of 3 at this point, but I think this one has some real staying power. The fact that the people I've played this with have requested it during our next meetings says a lot. I'm excited/curious to see a full 7 player game. Great game to start or end a night on.

RATING: 10
Pros:
- quick playing time allows me to get in games easily.
- cards are nice and colorful.  It looks pretty on the table and gets the attention of folks passing by.
- I enjoy the draft-and-pass mechanic to construct your play field. 
- scales well for almost any number of players.

Cons:
- the cards are a little flimsy and wear.  Can be eliminated by sleeving - but I hate sleeving :)
- some of the backs of the cards (age 3) are slightly a different color than others.  Doesn't bother me much, and again can be eliminated by sleeving, but does bother some.

 7/20/13 updating to a ten.  This is a great game my whole family enjoys.  We recently added the cities expansion which helped round out things nicely.  Also constructed the fan expansion lost wonders, which is fantastic.

Played just a few games so far.  I didn't find it to be as good a game as I thought it would be based on various reviews and hype.   It felt a little random (probably because I don't yet know the cards well).  I'll need to play some more to become more familiar.

Update:  played a few more times and had much more fun with this game.

Update:  every time I play, I enjoy more.  The streamlined mechanics boil down a civiliation building game to its bare bones (while maintaining resource collection and importance of military).  That's quite an accomplishment and that's quite a game!

Dan has this.
Description: Ancient civilization city building, card drafting, set collection game with simultaneous action selection and variable player (Wonder) powers.
Weight: Light.
Number of players: 2 to 7. Good with all counts from 3 to 7.
Designer: Antoine Bauza.
Publisher: Repos Production.

Impression: First it was awesome, than it started to be repetitive, and finally I started to enjoy pretty much every time we play. And no matter how many players there is, it flows like a charm, due to simultaneous action selection. Drafting is something that takes the most time because there is a lot of decision making. Will you go for blues, or greens, or more resources, or maybe military, maybe you need money, or perhaps a stage of your Wonder or you just simply want to block your neighbor from getting a certain card. Haven't yet tried all the expansions.

Likes: Drafting. Simultaneous card play. Many different double sided wonders (more than 7 with expansions) with unique powers on each side. Using resources from your neighbors for a fee. Multiple viable strategies.

Dislikes: It might become stale after you try all the strategies.

We played this with a friend and really enjoyed it.  The decisions/interaction with other players makes this game very expandable.

The simultaneous player turns makes this game move quickly too.  Occasionally you'll end up waiting for that one player with analysis paralysis, but it's not bad.

Really a solid game!

Still getting to grips with this. I've played a lot of M:tG booster draft, and whilst I'm not sure this quite has the depth on offer there, it still has a lot going on and, cruicialy, a mechanic that means the game will work for 7 players without starting to break or extend the playtime. I suspect it will be at its best for groups where everyone has played a few games and have started to keep more of a close watch on their neighbours.

Fun, fast game, which is somewhere between a filler and a "full" game, both from length as from decision depth. 7 wonders is a bit special, since it scales extremely well over different player  numbers such that this is  a very good game for 6 or 7 players without increasing the down-time!

RATING: 7.5
I bought 7 Wonders to introduce to my gaming group (my partner, my mother and her partner, as well as a gamer friend with whom I sporadically play a board-game once in a blue moon) after TTR and Catan.

7 Wonders is a essentially a card game that utilises a drafting mechanic that allows players to select cards that will allow them to develop their civilisation and build their Wonders. There are a number of different paths to victory available, and using the cards to build a tableau representing the development of your civilisation, and the various development 'engines' (paths) is visually pleasing. 

7 Wonders didn't feel as satisfying as I hoped after all of the positive reviews. The reason for the extra .5 score is because the game scales incredibly well - playable from 2-7. I played with 3 players because my friend and my partner were both late drop-outs (former had to head home for dinner and got waylaid by TV, and the latter feel asleep on the sofa.

Re-rated: 1 point increase after playing with the full compliment (7) of players at a London on Board meet. I foresee more play an an increased rating w/ full player compliment and possible expansions.

Each player controls an ancient civilization and plans a path to victory by attempting to score points in science, military, commerce, civilian structures, guilds and by building their Wonder. Players take turns simultaneously via a unique card-drafting mechanic: you choose a card from a hand, then pass that hand to your neighbor. The rules are simple and there are multiple paths to victory.

A very good, solid, entertaining game that doesn't take too long to play (less than an hour, perhaps as quick as half-an-hour).

This is an incredible civ type game that plays quick and easy but has so much variety.   Multiple ways to win and is everything I would ever want in a quick civ game.  It's thematic, makes sense and really nice to look at.   after two more plays this game has displayed multiply ways to victory.  Unfortunately not my victory but I love it game.  I did earn a beer for losing with the expansion rules though. edit :notched my first win-the aspects of this game just get better and better.  It's quick like Dominion but deep as I need a civ game to  be and despite the majority of card being identical, the game plays different each time.  I guess the only thing I can say bad about the game is that the hands can be random an sometimes so you get a hand of garbage and other times you get everything you would possibly want. I have to raise the rating of this because i can't see a time I wouldn't want to play.

I love, love, love this game.  

I never get tired of it and as you can see I have almost everything you can get for this game.  It's excellent.

The play in this game, to me, is very fast and engaging, you have some player interaction.  Most of that is concern for what your neighbors are doing but that is something.

Recommend the insert if you want to get the expansions, makes life way easier.

Both my wife and I really enjoy this game so far. My parents, however, found it to be much too complex. This surprised me, but I think it is at least partially because the information and icons on the cards are pretty small and my dad's eyes are not good enough to easily read the relevant information. 

I love the simultaneous action mechanic in the game and other game design decisions designed to keep things streamlined and moving. (For example, military resolving against only your two neighbors.) Would love to play this more with several player counts.

Anyway, I'm hoping to find some players as this game is going to get stale using 2 player variants.

RATING: 5
I've played this around 5 times, with between 4 and 7 players. I just don't get the appeal. It isn't really a drafting game - you can't leave cards in the pack and hope they come back to you, even in small player games - you take the card that's best for you most of the time, or if building your wonder you take the card that's worst for your opponents. It isn't really a civ-building game... you don't really build an engine and play with it, because it's too short, and the engine is too simple. And the military feels like prisoner's dilemma. If it's goal was to make a game that scales up to 7 players without increasing much in time, it did a pretty good job... the only argument is in how much "game" was actually built.

RATING: 4.2
This is very poor game. Yes, it is clearly inspired by the booster draft format of Magic (one of the least entertaining and most expensive ways to play that game) but it has none of the cleverness of that.
The game tries to play very, very quickly, but it is far too complex for that level of play (a currency, 7 different resource types, 5 different victory point schemes). The core idea, of drawing a card and passing on the hand while other players do the same is sound, but if it was intended to play fast for large numbers of players (and it clearly was) it needed a much simpler set of cards, which would have enhanced, rather than diminishing the decision making process.
One for a designer to try once and go 'ooh, I know how that could be made to work' but not one to be played or bought, though it seems to have fared well in the Essen '10 hype.

RATING: 7.5
A civilisation card building game spanning 3 ages. Each game lasting around 30 minutes, regardless of the number of players (3-7) which is a big plus.  It's  fairly easy to learn/teach with most people taking just one game to fully appreciate the mechanics.

Direct game play interaction is limited to the players either side of you.  The card drafting mechanic whereby cards are passed in one direction until all but one are allotted, provides some potential to limit options to other players.  The mechanic can also be seen in Among The Stars. 

There are various expansions available, none of which are essential to get a feel for the game.

:star::star::star::star::nostar: Easy to learn
:star::star::halfstar::nostar::nostar: Fun factor
:star::star::star::star::nostar:   Replay-ability

:star::star::star::nostar::nostar:     Overall

Why the game stays in my collection? The take one card and pass the rest to the player next to you mechanic creates situations where you are torn between picking the best card for yourself or the one that lets other players score the least. The multiple scoring paths and light feel of the game.

I've played this quite a few times. I'd definitely classify this as a filler. 

I enjoy the pacing but was discouraged and frustrated with trying to figure out what cards are worth keeping. Doubtless once I get past that hurdle the game would become more fun for me. But I'm concerned that introducing it to new players would be less fun for them. 

Wait, what am I talking about? Everybody has played this now right?

Great game in which after well over 100 games (mostly online) I'm still learning. Watching what you're opponents are doing, anticipating what your neighbours (especially the one to your right) is doing (most importantly, the military cards).
I now consistently score above 50 points, but still often get beat badly. Game play is very quick, with new players max. 1 hour and with experienced players this go down to under 30 minutes, while still having plenty of strategy.

Awesome game!

It's remarkable just how good this game manages to be, given that the mechanics are little more than just straight card-drafting. But it manages to be near infinitely replayable because of all the different wonders you can play and how they interact with those of the other players - and, of course, how the cards get dealt. And I know of no other game that can produce such a satisfying experience with player counts from 3 to 7 in just 20 minutes or so. (I'm not a fan of the official 2-player variant, even though I think it's much better with 3 or 4 than with higher numbers - but I'm still happy to play a 7-player game). It becomes a more fulfilling game with expansions, but even just base 7 wonders, without being a particularly deep game, is really too satisfying an experience to be called a mere filler, despite its short play-time and simple mechanics.

RATING: 9.9

As one commenter says, this is not going to do it for those who can't find a game challenging enough unless it takes more than 2 hours to play. But for people like me, this game offers the best "bang" in terms of challenge/interesting play per "time," less than an hour to play. 

Many people consider Dominion the best "bang" for "time" out there. 

This game far surpasses Dominion to me and gets my highest rating. The only reason it does not get a 10 is that I generally believe that there is always improvement.

If someone can improve upon this while keeping under an hour in time, it would be gaming heaven.

RATING: 8
Fantastic game that's quite flexible. Really hits the sweet spot between simple/fast and complex/engaging: there are very few people that would be too intimidated to play if you're a solid instructor. That said, it can be a bit challenging to explain to someone that doesn't game often. Also works well as a two-player game, using the dummy third as a shield/bludgeon/bank. Only other minor gripe would be duration - can stretch well beyond 30-45 minutes for first-timers or those predisposed to AP. Highly recommend.

Hey, it's pretty good. Pretty great? Sure thing, buddy. I wish it didn't have so many little pieces because it's a pain to set up but I really do prefer two-player 7 Wonders to any other version, including 7 Wonders Duel. The alternating third hand gives a ton of control over the game and makes it much more strategic. No elves, which is also a plus.

Great component quality and box/game art. 

Gameplay is fairly simple to explain to newer players, but does have a good element of depth/strategy to get into. Do enjoy the mechanic of checking a hand of cards, draw one and then pass it on. 

Overall, I find this a solid game that I do enjoy playing. But not a go-to game to base an evening around.

RATING: 4
Admittedly, I am not a huge fan of card-drafting games. I do not much like having my strategy be beholden to the whims of others, rather than just straight luck of the draw. The gameplay also tends to become stale after a few rounds, and I felt that 7 Wonders was no exception. The card iconography was annoyingly incoherent, and I do not think this problem would have been as significant had there not been such a sheer amount of icons to follow. I would imagine participating in multiple plays will alleviate this issue.

We played with six players, and this may have hurt the pace and interaction to a degree. I could see the interaction becoming more pronounced at three players, but the game dragged on to become so rote that I have no desire to explore it further. In fact, the myriad of expansions to the base game suggests quantity reigns over quality in this much-heralded title.

(+) Gameplay flows smoothly.
(+) Theme is recognizable and has arguably wide appeal.
(+) Variable nations and expansions provide some replayability (not necessarily much more depth).

(-) Iconography is in abundance and not always intuitive.
(-) Gameplay starts to feel repetitive and drags at higher player counts.
(-) Minimal amount of player interaction leads to a dull metagame that does not incentivize further plays.

I guess this is an improvement on Fairy Tale, and I like it, but it kind of loses my favorite part of the drafting mechanic by making all the information public and making card play instantaneous, which was figuring out the intentions of the people passing to you by what's missing...

Still, pleasant.

UPDATE: After more play, something about this game has turned repellent and dull to me.

Didn't click with me. This game is neat in that you pick a card to keep out of the 5 (or whatever the rules say) in your hand. Then you pass the remainder of the cards to the person on your left. Play continues in this fashion for pretty much the whole game. That's the only neat part about the game to me. Otherwise, it just seems like there are 20952347098 ways to score points with the different types of cards in the deck.

RATING: 8.3
Fluid, quick, fun, light game. 

This game is tactical while hanging a strategy carrot for you to try to follow. While the game seems to be encouraging you to have a strategic plan, that plan can and probably will change as the game goes along. You just do the best you can with the cards that are handed to you and hope future hands will work with what you are trying to do.

The different paths to victory seem pretty balanced, but it is tough to win with a heavy military focus unless another scoring method is explored as well. I've won by going nearly completely commercial, civilian and scientific. Going completely military is the only path which has a hard cap of points you can earn - only 18 points total (and only if you win every single battle all game- which is far from guaranteed. 18 points is pretty small compared to scoring 58 by going straight scientific for instance).

This game scores bonus points from me for not playing any slower with 7 than it does with 3. The 2 player game even works pretty well.

A resource game without resources.  Well, they are there, you just don't bank them - instead using resources from those available in your tableau (or those of  your neighbouring players).  The card draft mechanic is interesting resulting in a quick playing game.  On the plus side - a game to table when there are a larger number of players seeking to play a game.  (Rating reflects playing with 5~7 players...there are other games I might play such as Peloponnes with fewer players.)

14-03-2014. After playing 2 more games. The game deserves a higher rating. Upgraded from 7 to 7.5. I like how this game takes the drafting mechanic, combines it with simple scoring mechanics to become a very nice, quick game with nice scoring. Downside for me, is that Alien Frontiers is very similar, but does it better (for me).

26-01-2014. Rated after first play. I like the game. Very quick game, almost in the filler category. Decisions are there and meaningful. I do wonder if I like the depth of the game, since it seems that there is not much going on except grab points.

It's surprising that a game with such simple rules can be so entertaining! Once you select an ancient city, all you do is pick a card and pass the rest to your neighbor. But should you prepare for war? Pursue advancement in science? Add to your marketplace with resources for sale? Perhaps you should just build a statue. With each player needing to build one of the seven wonders of the ancient world, should you commit resources to the great pyramid now or later? The decision making process is what makes this game so fun. We take 30-45 minutes for a 4-player game. Try it and you will be hooked.

Overall I like the game, but it's not fun enough to get it on the table.

This is just a classic and packs a lot of fun in a short timeframe. This game is a great game design. It is amazing that the game can be played in 30 minutes even with the full seven player. I can't bring myself to play with anything less than 4 players but it is the easiest game to hit the table, not in terms of set up, but in terms of game play.  The rules are easy to pick up but the game is still is strategic.

So far after about 5 plays this is really good. Have tried it with 4 and 5. Super fast, fun. 

Update: After more plays and more thinking about this. I think the game is perfect for what it is attempting to be. A medium weight game that gets deeper with more plays. It can accomidate up to 7 players with no down time. The game plays amazingly fast, and is a lot of fun. The production value is very high, the art is good, and the setup is really quite fast considering it is variable to the number of players.

My favorite card drafting game.  Each game is a bit different based on what cards you see in front of you as well as what wonder you choose.  People used to playing board games will pick up on it quickly.  Usually I creme them the first game we play, but then they always beat me the next game.  I must not be very good...  I even got my family to play this a couple of times, although it was harder for some of them to follow the rules of what cards you can and can not play.  Recommended mostly for board game fans.

--Dec2010-- Delightfully themed drafting game.  After only 1 play with 3, I'm not at all competent to judge its merits.  But I rather enjoyed the first outing:  it seemed rather similar in feel to _Fairy Tale_.
--Aug2011-- Yet after a few games, it seems to be a species of blind bidding.  One wins if the set of synergies one chooses aren't the current fashion amongst one's opponents.  And loses if one subscribes to the current groupthink.  It's very pretty, but it doesn't look like there's much substance.

This game fills a nice spot in my collection in that it is not a party game and can still play up to 7 players in under an hour. For that alone, I give it high marks. Not too complicated either, so a good one to pull out with many people, though I think the rules are a touch too complex to work with everyone.

The game itself actually provides some excruciating choices, though there's a few automatic ones too. Player interaction is higher than I expected too since many of those choices come from taking what you want or preventing your neighbor from getting that one card that will give them a lot of points. Randomness is a little higher than I care for though.

RATING: 8
Alapvetően túlhype-olt játéknak gondolom...

Van számos előnye: 2-től 7 főig játszható másik játékot nem nagyon tudok, amelyik ennyire kiegyensúlyozott a játékosszámtól függetlenül. Ráadásul ugyanakkor meglehetősen rapid is (max. 30 perc körül lehet). A jó játékok védjegyeivel bír: ezer út vezet a győzelemhez, maga a játék szép, az ikonok rengeteget segítenek stb.  (Bár, az igazság az, hogy a kártyák rajzai semmit nem tesznek hozzá a történethez, az ember szinte csak az ikonokra fókuszál). A táblákon levő csoda megjelenítések is igazán remekek.

Ugyanakkor, amik nem tetszettek benne: kvázi passziánsz jellegű (oké, hogy a szomszédokra folyamatosan kell figyelni, de 3+ fő esetén a többiekre vajmi kevés a befolyás). Mivel mindenki maga építgeti a paklijait, viszonylag kevés az interakció (a kereskedelem ellenére is). Nyugodtan lehetne konfrontatívabb is. Fentiek okán talán ezért a legjobb 3 fővel, mert mindenki függ mindenkitől.
5-7 játékos esetén eléggé "kaotikus", ahogy mindenki egyszerre építgeti a le a lapjait (persze pont emiatt a parallel helyzet miatt gyors...)
Valamint a kártyák minősége eléggé lehangoló, főleg annak függvényében, hogy egy 10eFt körüli (kvázi kártya)játékról beszélünk.

Mindent egybevetve szerethető, de nekem valami még hiányzik belőle (ezt majd talán a kiegészítők valamelyike pótolja?).

In just three months, 7 Wonders has become the No. 1 Family Game in the World! It has all the features of being a top family game: zero text reading, quickplay, supporting up to 7 players, bright colours. You use your cards to build your own Wonders and other structures. However I don't think 7 Wonders is newbie-friendly: you got to explain to new players about the meaning of the card symbols, and they usually are not sure about which card to play/pass, which almost guarantee a loss in their debut and a win by his/her neighbor, making new players repulsive for a second session. Ah, the Card Drafting, the weakest player decides the winner.

A drafting game that looks great, scales well, and offers multiple paths to victory? There's a reason it's a staple on the BGG top 50.

My wife bought this game not too long ago.  After about a dozen plays, I'm finding my self really appreciating how each game is different and how you can apply a different set of strategies each time.  The scoring can sometimes surprise you with who wins, but that is a minor gripe.  It also doesn't hurt that the game looks gorgeous!

Simple card game with drafting machanic to collect cards. Obviously an army of expansions available in a FLGS near you. Plays quickly and it's easy to learn the cards to be played.

One play with seven and I really liked it. Looking forward to more plays.

Update: So, I have played this 7 times over the last two years and I still haven't played it well. I'd like to build a much bigger empire I guess because I spread my ideas way too thin. 18 cards, that is all you get. And three of them usually go in the wonder. I need to focus from the beginning on something. Also, I need to pay attention to what other people are doing.

RATING: 6
Number of plays is more likely double since I've had thsi before I started logging. Rating has declined as time goes by. For me, the game is at its best with more than 5, because that's when you get the most tension out of it. I realized some time ago that what's kept this game interesting for me is the tension in choosing the best card out of every hand when it passes you by and then seeing how thing turn out. Ultimately though, interaction in this game is observational, not direct or even indirect. Trades can never be denied and the fighting is way abstracted and not very profitable. Interaction here means that you should keep an out for what others are doing, though it never seems to pay off to build something someone else would've wanted if you have the option of building something even remotely good for you.

Sold on account of hollow core and because almost everyone has it should I ever want to play.

8.5.13: I don't mind playing.  Totally fine mixing it into the games cycle, but, never want to hit it too frequently.  I'd simply prefer to play other games.  Of course the game is improved by both expansions (I prefer more complex games).  For me, I'd only play it with expansions.

It plays quickly, accommodates an unusally large number of players and is quite interesting. However, I can see it lacking replay value; I need to play the B-side of the wonders before making a final decision, though. Also, considering the fact that it is not much more than a well-executed filler, I find it really quite expensive.

On playing it more, I had the feeling of being constantly at the mercy of the cards handed to me, but also having nothing more fun to do than to pick a card and then passing along my hand. I will happily admit that this may be an indication of my lack of experience of the game, but there is little here to enthuse me enough to play more.

I won't turn down a game, but it wouldn't be my first suggestion either.

Quite a few reviews compare this game with Dominion and Race for the Galaxy, but, as a regular player of both, 7 Wonders doesn't play at all like the two. I suppose that, since 7 Wonders has cards which you pick, that makes 7 Wonders similar to both Race and Dominion. Which, in my opinion, it does not. Eurogamers should like 7 Wonders, but, as an erstwhile non-drafting CCG player, I found this game as generic as any other Eurogame (cards and boards have good art, though). The drafting pretty much tweaks the usual tired "multiple paths to victory" Eurogame mechanic. Drafting *does* require you deny cards the player you will pass card on to, but I'm pretty "meh" on this mechanic. As with other "multiple paths to victory" Eurogames, you'll need to "become familiar with" (aka. memorize) the cards -- not to mention scoring system -- a Eurogame tendency which pretty much negates the selling point of the simplicity of the game mechanics. If you're looking for a Eurogame with another novel mechanic (by Eurostandards, at least), I guess this is it. But if 7 Wonders is comparable to Dominion, both are just like Risk.

****

Beats me.

See, I just played it yesterday. And I hated it. The draft mechanic doesn't make the tired old "multiple paths to victory" Euromechanic any better. As for "filler", the game just took too d*mn long for what you did: pick a card and pass the rest along. 

I don't think the game's overrated at all. I *know* many BGG'ers love the "multiple paths" mechanic. I find it all too much to memorize, since you have to [-]memorize[/-] be familiar with the scoring system *and* the card distribution in the deck *and* the cards themselves. Which I find to be a PITA. Drafting, meanwhile, is a new mechanic to the Eurocrowd. Fairy Tales does it, but FT didn't add the "multiple paths" mechanic. 

Eurogamers *should* try this game. I'm not a Eurogamer, so don't have any interest in playing this again.

***

Didn't like 7 Wonders at all:
* Scales terribly with 7 players. You get a new hand of cards each turn, so it's like trying to put a strategy onto a pile of random cards.
* Turns are fast only if you know what you're doing, which means you must know the cards in the deck (assuming you want to win).
* With 7 players, you're mostly denying the next player an optimal move. Passive aggression at its finest.
* Player socialization is limited to looking over your neighbor's shoulder to look at his cards, or passing him a better hand if he or she is you non-gaming spouse.
* Yet another arbitrary "multiple paths to victory" scoring system.

We played a game of seven players, two with some experience. I think I came in second or third, with the winning player and myself saying we wouldn't play the game again.

Citadels: Deduction and outguessing. With bursts of smack talk.
7 Wonders: Deny your opponent an optimal card. Repeat until done.

I probably *would* play 7 Wonders two-player. In two-player, you will receive back the hand you passed to your opponent, so you can do some planning. Also, my two-player CCG opponent would give me the time to AP out a turn.

****

Main problems about the game for the non-gamers:

* Hidden information. *Some* non-gamers don't like the "emotional" conflict of revealing information to a more experienced player (ie. you) while not understanding the cards.

* Icons. Icons are essentially a different language. Yes, I'd like to play my games in Swahili.

That's obviously why Race for the Galaxy isn't a gateway game, while the "other" role selection game, Puerto Rico (sometimes) is.

RATING: 8
The base mechanic of this game is very simple: pick a card to play, pass the rest of the cards to your neighbour (left or right, depending on the "Age" you're playing in). But there's some clever decision making connected to this simple mechanic: what kind(s) of card(s) will you focus on for endgame scoring, which cards can you build cheapest, which cards do you definitely want to keep out of your neighbour's hands,...?

All players pick, then play, their cards simultaneously. This makes the game flow very smoothly, especially if you're playing with people who are familiar with the rules. Things don't get boring, as you're always trying out new ways of scoring that fit well with the Wonder you've been dealt.

Lastly, the components are great, as is to be expected from a [company=4384][/company]-game. Sturdy cardboard for the Wonder boards and tokens (coins, victory and defeat tokens). Beautiful artwork. And great graphic design on the cards, with clear icons for resources and special effects. The design also keeps table clutter to a minimum, as it helps you put your cards down in an organized manner - although some players still manage to make a mess of things...

RATING: 10
A solid game for a number of reasons. Visually appealing, well-presented, and with nice tokens and boards, the game manages to be interesting without relying on wacky mechanics or themes.

One of the great things about 7 Wonders is that a game nearly always takes roughly the same time - players take 18 turns across 3 ages. Since direct interaction (apart from which cards get passed on) is confined to direct neighbours, the game remains simple with any number of players. Combined, this makes a game that can take 3-7 players with very little change in set up, and no increase in play time (except for comparing scores at the end!).

Nicely balanced around its drafting mechanic, every turn sees you building up your collection of structures. Resources being permanent is another addition that prevents gameplay becoming an accounting exercise.

7 Wonders has a rare quality - it's simple, quick and attractive enough to interest casual (or non) gamers (a single guided game is a good way to teach someone), and tactical enough for more serious players. In the two weeks since I have bought this game it has been the favourite for lunchtime games with colleagues, and often comes out at home before or after another longer game.

While it's not impossible to overplay this game, it will probably never be something you'll object to playing, and is a good way to spend some time, and introduce other people to the wonders of quality board gaming. At a low-medium price range, this game is definitely worth the cost.

Though at present (having played the game many, many times in the last two weeks) my personal enjoyment of the game would leave it rated at 9, when I consider all of the ways this game is well-made, and the impact it has had on my friends and coworkers (direct fun, and getting them interested in board gaming), it deserves the full rating of 10.

Shortness and scalability is a lousy reason to have a game. 7 Wonders is a frustrating game, because there's something good there. But there has to be more to a game than simply picking a card six times each round. The cards themselves have minimal impact, or at least they feel like they do, which is just as bad. I'm in favor of games figuring out how to abstract their theme, but 7 Wonders takes it too far.

Mostly it just makes it harder to teach. Past that, hate drafting seems to be unviable a lot of the time, which encourages this game to feel especially solitairey.

I like the hand-swapping/draft mechanism - it eliminates a lot of potential for AP without completely removing opportunities for strategy, and allows neighbors to subtly mess with one another. The many different wonders can help establish a route to take and allow for some good replayability. I also enjoy the shifting narrative of the phases - you initially need to establish means to build things and start thinking about which route you will take. Later, you use your resources to most efficiently pursue the route/s you've chosen.
This occasionally feels a bit rote - there are resources you simply must pursue, though the game punishes you very little if you don't get them, as you can most likely buy them from your neighbors, and you can build a surprising number of buildings for free given the proper prerequisites.
What's more, it can be hard to really lock down an overall strategy for this game, in part because the paths to victory are so disconnected, numerous, and ultimately similar. Final scoring feels a little bland and overly-convoluted, and is enough of a barrier to teaching this to new players (particularly non-gamers) that I don't tend to reach for this one as much as I used to.

Xmas 2014 from Graeme

I've played this game several times round friends houses and just loved it.  It's fast paced, you don't really screw people over which I love in a game (apart from armies, which you don't actually suffer from that much) and its about building wonders!! I play so many PC strategy games and this is age of empires in a nutshell.

We can play as a 2 and have introduced it to many of our friends who have all picked it up even if they aren't big gamers.  A great game I personally can't fault.

Kellemes, gyors játék - ha akarod igen komoly taktikai mélységgel.
Ugyanakkor a leosztásokon is sok múlik, így ha véghezviszed a kigondolt tervedet még közel se biztos, hogy nyersz.
A draft mechanizmus ezzel a játékkal lett szuper-népszerű! Kis hátrány, hogy ketten csak nyögvenyelősen lehet játszani, három játékosnál pedig mindenki-mindenkivel interakció van. Így az igazi mélység 4+ játékosnál jön elő, amikor olyan emberek fejlődését is számba kell venni, akikkel nincs direkt kapcsolat a játékmenetben.

A little hectic with 7, but I really love drafting.  Then again, what other games play so well with most player counts (I still like 5 as the sweet spot).  It has great pacing and the expansions mix things up enough to keep it more interesting for experts.

This has been a favorite for years and while it doesn't get busted out a ton with my regular group, we still find time for it here and there.  I can't imagine that changing.

A truly great achievement in gaming in that it manages to make a strategic and quick 7-player game, with at least one interesting mechanic. 

Not the best game of all time, not the most tactical game either, but tactical enough that I'd play it regularly, and the ability to play 7 players in a light, fast game is what makes this a great part of my collection.

I can't think of anything I dislike about this game. I love the aesthetic, the quick playing, the various viable strategies, and the huge player range. I'm not sure how an expansion could improve how I feel about this game.

Maybe it's dependent on who you're sitting next to, as well as the luck of the draft, but I still really enjoy playing game after game.

RATING: 5.5
Visual Appeal: (4)
Art on the components is beautiful and immersive, even if the theme is fairly shallow. 21 awards displayed on the outside of the box seems a little boastful...

Components: (3)
Average quality cards. I could sleeve them I guess, but I'd expect them to deteriorate anyhow when handled heavily in so many 5-7p games over its lifetime. Wonder boards feel nice and sturdy. No warping here so far.

Theme: (2)
Take a card, pass the rest. Make a set, collect more symbols, repeat. The building of wonders while sacrificing a card fits nicely, and I like the idea of buying resources from your neighbors. The game sacrifices theme for simplicity. I used to draft MtG, and the drafting had more weight to it because your creation had to survive an onslaught from other players. In this game you create a spread of cards for points which just feels flat in comparison.

Learning: (4)
A simple game which is simply taught. One thing that the rule book might have done is provide more suggestions for new gamers who might freeze up when faced with a scoring system as layered as this one. There are 7 sources of points, and this can be intimidating. After a 7 player game with 5 newbies lasted over 90 minutes, I changed my teaching tactics to include some guidance on choosing a card. One might also consider adding a 60 second timer.

Gameplay: (2) Lackluster. Occasionally heated drafting against my neighbors, but when someone 3 seats away from me is running away with the game I can do very little about it. The game feels more controllable with 3-4 players, but if it advertises up to 7 it should play well with 7. I am disappointed that I end up reaching over this game for Resistance or Saboteur at 7 players. The disappointment is soon forgotten though, because they are just more fun than 7 Wonders would have been anyway.

Overall Fun: (2) 
I have some friends who enjoy this game quite a bit, so it comes out every now and again, just not with more than 4 players. Nothing to do while Sammy Slow-picker to your right takes his turn. The inability to actively affect the game state at large player counts. I rarely end the game feeling like I am satisfied, or that I made any difficult choices.

A wonderful game that I always enjoy playing. The base game works very well for a family game, as the mechanics are very easy to teach and learn. While the base game can often feel like each player is playing their own game of solitaire, the expansions add elements that make the game a lot more interactive. 7 Wonders is a game that works well in most settings, regardless of the experience of the players involved.

While new players may slow down the game a little, after only a few plays the game will flow fluently enough for a full game to last less than an hour. The game also scales really well from 3 to 7 players without causing any downtime.

For what it is - a filler for both small and large groups and a feeling of actually developing a civilization it's excellent. Not my type of game though - not nearly enough control and strategy in it. Draft is a good way of distributing cards for a game, but as a sole mechanic not so much.

RATING: 8
Definitely a very enjoyable game, with the drafting element providing another new combination of old mechanics to make a building game enjoyableSpeed of play is obviously a big plus. For some reason, I don't feel particularly drawn to try to add this to my collection.

[Edit] Bought with Amazon credit, which helped bring the price to a respectable level (still £17 with sleeves, ow), as this is one of my wife's favourite games. We played a bit 2 player - which is decent, just high risk of burnout due to most cards getting seen every game. Definitely best with 3 or 4 owing to the strategic element of planning what to gamble on coming back into your hand.

It has gone up in my estimation owing to the fact that I TOTALLY ROCK AT THIS GAME, which clearly demonstrates that ist is a game that rewards sheer puissance and good breeding.

RATING: 5
I respect 7 Wonders as a clever idea more than I enjoy it as a game. What is clever is that traditional euro-style resource management and set collection are wrapped into a purely simultaneous design. (By this I mean that all decisions are simultaneous.) It's not hard to see how this would result in a game that can support many players without significant play time or down time bloat. That's the essence of most clever ideas - being the first to do something simple. As a game, it's just not my kind of fun. Too chaotic and short. Also, I find it annoying that nearly all of the skill of the game comes from knowledge of the decks. I feel like each player would benefit by having a massive chart showing all the cards, all their prerequisites, and what they do. Card counting also looms heavily as players begin to make more advanced decisions. While playing 7 Wonders, I can't help but feel that I'm making a decision based on some complex chart that I'm trying to picture (and remember) in my mind. That's simply not the kind of gaming challenge I seek.

RATING: 7
Clearly the attraction here for me is a decent game that plays up to seven players in 30 minutes. If 7 Wonders didn't lure me and present me with this gimmick though I would be inclined to dwell on its faults: It's abstract civilization building with a drafting mechanic and the luck of being handed cards you need (or not).

7 Wonders is an overpriced game with a good trick - fast playing time with seven players in a simple to learn package. Indeed you'll be looking to reserve this for occasions when you have more than five players just so you'll be using most of the cards from the box. With three players the 63 cards used certainly gives the impression you've been delivered a little card game in an ocean sized shipping container.

Of the two card games with similar themes from 2010 I'd hand Innovation the clear prize over this for entertainment value and depth. That said, how can you not appreciate an engaging game that plays smoothly and quickly up to seven players? It's a keeper.

RATING: 6
A fun drafting/set-collection game.  Great for scaling 3-7, and drafting has the added benefit of minimal downtime, but I feel there's little you can do in this game.  Maybe I generally play with too many people but it's nearly impossible to interact with a player not to your immediate left or right, and because of this someone 2 or 3 seats downstream might just crush you because they're sitting next to the new player.  Still a good short game though.

Because of the above problem, I feel this game is probably best (tightest) with three or four players, but this game's reputation of supporting up to seven means it gets brought out most commonly when there are six or seven players.  Getting in some games with three or four might cause me to raise my rating.

RATING: 7
This has been such a failure for me... not because it's not a great game, but because the complexity of the scoring levers has been beyond my ability to teach effectively.

Base game rules are pretty easy for newer gamers to pick up on.  

I have had a blast every time I have played this game.  

My only criticism is in larger games, you have next to no interaction with the players across from you.  It seems that it is always an advantage to be seated next to the newest player.

Believe the hype - this is a great game that plays fast, offers a lot of agonizing decisions, and rewards smart play. It a good second-step game for those friends/family of yours that have tried a few light/gateway games and are ready for something a little tougher but still has enough meat to keep a veteran gamer happy.

RATING: 8
Simple, short and yet the thematic chrome sort of works.  The clever idea of limiting serious interaction to just your neighbours means that a full 7p game doesn't drag horribly which is also a neat trick.
I suspect this may exhaust its welcome quite fast, as there are many fewer options than, e.g. RtfG, but while it lasts it's going to be fun.  And I imagine it will come out of the cupboard quite often after that too.

7 Wonders is a great card drafting game. There is a good amount of strategy, although this goes down with increased player count. 7 Wonders plays best with 3, and it gets worse with additional players. It is still better than most games with more players, but it is not a tight game like it is with 3. The game works decently with 2, but not as well as with 3. The simultaneous action selection means that adding players doesn't significantly slow the game, so in that sense, it scales perfectly.

I like the interaction with neighbors, I like the drafting, and I like the different ways to get points. There is way more subtlety to the game than many give it credit for. While people complain about the lack of interaction, I think there is just the right amount. It's streamlined enough that it doesn't slow play, but present enough to matter significantly to the flow of the game, and in determining the winner.

Comparisons with Fairy Tale are common, but I vastly prefer 7 Wonders. The game is much tighter, especially with 3, as the randomness is confined to the distribution between the hands, rather than which cards are in the game. Fairy Tale is simpler, but it doesn't have the full range of strategic considerations that 7 Wonders enjoys. Fairy Tale feels like 10% of the game that 7 Wonders is.

7 Wonders has been somewhat supplanted by 7 Wonders: Duel for me, which combines many of the same ideas with more tension.

However the main draw back is that it requires at least one play to understand the game and the strategy so new players usually need a game under their belt to have a true idea of the game.

Our Game of 2010.
What I like about 7 Wonders is that it is a nice, lite game that feels epic. With all the symbols, the different colored cards and with your Wonder board, the game makes it feel as if you are building up a civilization when you are really just drafting and playing a card.
Highly recommended. 2 or more players.
Update: Took a ratings hit with the release of 7 Wonders: Duel that plays better for us as a two player game. The original is still great though.

I like how it's quick, and scales well.  It's still a quick game with 7 people, as long as they know what they're doing.

Great drafting game. There's a lot going on that makes it a bit heavy for a gateway game, but once you're familiar with it the game plays extremely smoothly. Beware of the "Melitary".

Updated note: Definitely still deserves this score, while it's a bit difficult to teach, it still grabs new people and we've played it a bunch of times with big groups. For a group of 7 people, there isn't really a better game out there.

A very decent drafting game and one of the very few that scale from two to seven players without bogging down in the slightest.
Yes, you mostly play with your direct neighbors, but the game would not stay under the 60 min mark otherwise.

My biggest concern* only reared it's head on a couple of turns, but for the most part felt absent. With 7 people I felt the game seemed very solitairy... the guy who won was 3 seats to my right, and I'm not sure I could have been keeping track of his board even if I wanted to, let alone affect it.

Played a 2nd time with 4 players, and that seemed better. Makes sense, with 4 you can affect all of the players more directly, and you get to see some of the packs twice - which I think is a big part of the drafting mechanism. I suspect 3 player would be best for this game. 

* My biggest concern going into 7 Wonders was this:

Have you ever done a Magic: the Gathering booster draft? I have, lots of them. In an MtG booster draft, if you had to decide with each draft whether the card will be in your Deck, Sideboard, or out of the game... then the draft would suck. That's how 7 Wonders works though, with each draft you must decide - before seeing other cards drafted - whether to play a card, use it in your wonder, or discard it for $3. In the end it wasn't as bad as all that in 7 Wonders, but I did curse that a couple of times during each of my 2 games.

Some interesting ideas here, though it still boils down to tactical evaluations based on your hand. Nigh unplayable at higher player counts. Interaction is with the neighbor only, which leads me to think this plays best with 3.

Not bad for a filler. The game is helped by excellent, intuitive iconography. The tech tree is easy as a breeze with the game's presentation.

This is a fantastic tableau civilization game with a simple simultaneous card drafting mechanic.  The game's theme is reinforced by the spectacular art of scenes from ancient near eastern and early western empires. I like how each player gets a different wonder with its own distinctive resource production and special wonder-building objectives. Far from a multi-player solitaire, I like that 7 Wonders keeps you on your toes by watching your neighbors tableau on the table closely from which you can purchase resources that you do not own as well as spy on their military strength compared with your own.  My wife and I also appreciate the advanced 2 player variant included in the base game which plays with a 3 player game but with a ghost player.  Best of all, this game plays in 30-45 minutes after the first couple plays and has helpful reference sheets to mitigate the various symbols on each card.  I hope to play the subsequent expansions in the near future.

A very fun, fast-playing card management game that is a little like multiplayer solitaire.  I love how you can buy resources from your neighbors and there are lots of cards that allow you to get points based on what your neighbors are doing.  The only drawback for me is in games with more than 3 players you can do everything right and still lose if your non-neighbors get better cards, have someone feeding them the cards they need, etc.  That makes this game an 8, but with 3 players, I think its great and could go up to a 9.

Very fun for 2 and especially 3+ players, but also very quick, which is good and hard to find, I think. Thematically is does well, though it still doesn't quite 'feel' like you are putting together a city. You don't see a city grow or anything - as it is a deck building game. 

Still very enjoyable, regardless. You definitely have to think about the players around you while you make decisions in this game if you want to win.

So this is the current darling of the Eurogame circuit.  I don't buy that it is a civilization game even though it has that theme.  It is actually fairly abstract.  Still, all of the mechanisms seem to fit together within the context of that theme, which is a nice bonus. 

In the grand scheme of things, I'm not sure of the ultimate amount of replayability.  However, with 7 (now 8 and likely more) civs each with two sides that each plays differently, there is a lot of room for just basic exploration.  In that sense, I think it will take a fair number of plays just to exhaust basic exploration of the game.  That is not a bad thing.  I'll have to see how it goes after that, but that point, I think, is still several years away.

I should go without mention that it fills a nice spot of being a quick game that plays up to seven (now eight) fairly well.  [03/13/2011]

The card game is so different than what I'm used to. There is a little bit of a work placement feel to the game, which I love.  The game play is played over 3 rounds and your trying to build your wonder, have the biggest army or have the most cultural spots. Either way you go about it the most VP wins.  Everyone has their own strategy for winning. The ability to use your neighbors resources to build on your own city allows for so many different opportunities but it comes at a cost. The game play is pretty fast and allows for some opportunity to mess with your opposing cities.

Nie skomplikowana gra charakteryzująca się szybką rozgrywką ...ale tylko pozornie - w rzeczywistości wymaga od gracza dobrej pamięci i spostrzegawczości, albowiem kluczem do zwycięstwa nie tyle jest realizacja swojej z góry ustalonej strategii, co odpowiednia reakcja na zagrania sąsiadujących z nami przeciwników.

A game I used to play in an eurogame club to avoid playing workerplacements. Ha! I actually figured this out after I stopped playing there and feel no need to ever play 7W again. 

Turns out the difference between workerplacement and drafting isn't so huge, as far as I can tell. Action selection in this or that drag. Probably I do prefer drafting as there's less of a sticking to plan and min-maxing (less does not mean there's not still a lot of it) and you can put nice pictures on the cards. 

So 7 Wonders - it's basically a gamified [thing=12][/thing]. You have your good ol' victory point spread sheet {a1+a2+a3+n1+n2+n3+.....+r^2+q^2+r^2}, you have 3 eras, you have your building your antiquity civilisation/city/monument/whatever, only instead of pushing your luck, now your set collection comes with bolts and whistles and optimising and whohoo! Some synergy between the cards is there, but not like RFTG where card do things. This is just set collecting with some engine building. Oh and comes with baked in multiple paths to victory, now colour coded for your convenience. 

But it's no family game. Firstly there's iconitis, which gets worse with Leaders expansion (that I otherwise like) - every leader card has its own icon it seems. Secondly you have no idea what you're doing till you're done - you'll figure out how things go together in your 2nd or 3rd play. Beware, do not push this at nongamers as I've seen them drown, staring at icons in bewilderment, looking at their measly tableau, having no clue how the engine works, and the cards! the cards just keep coming in! Aaaaa! 

Cute, fluffy and harmless. 
And only Bauza's game without Japan themes - because of publisher it seems (early prototype pictures have some Japanese scenery thingies).

7 Wonders has eveything a standard issue Euro has, only condensed into a card-drafting format. It has multiple ways to gain VP, the need to specialise in a particular scoring method, a little player interaction in the form of military bonuses... you get the point.

While it's rare that there's a decent game which supports up to 7 people and plays in a short amount of time, being able to only affect the players next to you can be frustrating. It becomes more interactive and less random when played with fewer players. A slightly-above-average game that I would be content playing every now and then.

In this drafting card game, you will draft and play 6 cards every round. There are many different card types and the goal is to get as many Vp as possible. There are resource cards which you need to buy other cards, there are also point cards, money cards, end condition scoring cards, set collection cards, military poeer cards. Etc.

This game plays fast with any amount of players, since everyone play simultaniously.

This game has so many things I love. Drafting! Simultaneous action! Variable player powers! Multiple paths to victory! It's fast. It's fun. This game is supposed to be released as an app soon(?!?!), and I cannot wait. I LOVE IT!

I bought my wife this board game for Christmas last year. Prior to this game, we'd only ever played Monopoly, Apples to Apples, and Bananagrams together. We opened the box and I couldn't believe how many rules there were! This game opened our eyes to the hobby. Since getting 7 Wonders last November (because we're adults and that means we can exchange early), I have played upwards for 60-70 different board games. Although I have slacked in my logging of plays, I downloaded the companion app for this game and have logged over 30 plays of this game (most with all expansions) and currently have an 81% win streak! Love this game and think everyone should add it to their collection!

P.S. If you play games primarily with 2 players and are on the fence about this because it says it only plays 3-7 players, dont worry! Despite what many people say, I actually LOVE the game's 2 player variant with what's called a "free city". This acts as a 3rd player for which each player takes turns drafting an extra card from a 3rd player deck. This adds a ton of new strategy because you can build cards that require the free city to pay you for resources, you can build cards or the free city's wonder stages with cards you don't want the other player to have, etc. Check it out!!

Really satisfying flow. Love the cooperative/comparative interaction with neighboring players. Especially enjoy with leaders since they give you direction even more than your monument.

RATING: 7.5
Overpriced: paying for 150+ cards and lots of air in a box. Can easily be compacted down to a mid-sized box at half the cost.

Gameplay is simple: players draft a card from a hand of seven and pass the rest along. Each card has effects. The idea is to build up your 'civ' by using resources to build other cards. There's science, trading, military, etc and the game goes through three sets of 7 cards.

VPs are scored for card effects, military might, money etc. It's more an card-engine building game than a true 'civ' game though.

The game clips along at a good pace owing to its set rounds of drafting. Slightly more chaos with card with more players. Neat little filler with good graphics.

Enjoyable light-weight card drafting, Civ-themed game.

Good filler though play tends to favour those with experience. Over produced...but not in a bad way.

i only played this once and was another game that i wanted to like but it didn't do much for me. maybe it was because there were 6 players and it was unbearably long. i'll try to break it out again soon.

Fantastyczna mechanika, dzięki której wszyscy gramy jednocześnie. Do tego znajdziemy tu umiarkowanie proste zasady, regrywalność i różne drogi zwycięstwa. Wszystko to przy pięknych grafikach budujących klimat starożytności. Najlepsza gra dla trzech osób.
Wady to tragiczny wariant dwuosobowy, brak interakcji dla większej liczby graczy, brak balansu na kartach cudów po stronie B oraz kartach naukowych względem pozostałych.

It's drafting at it's finest. The cities expansion really makes we want to continue to play this over and over. Every game is a completely different focus based on your starting wonder and leader cards, cannot wait to play it again. IT's a classic for a reason.

The first game I bought in the hobby. Requires at least 1 game to get up to speed and learn the symbols, but once everyone if familiar with the game, it plays quick and fluid, especially at high player counts which is where the main appeal of this game lies.

Unfortunately, I only got about 6 plays out of it in the course of a few months before I became bored with it. I could have bought an expansion, but I really would have preferred to get more bang for my buck in just the base set, so I traded it off.

I really like the game. I guess I'll just need to play it a few times to get it out of my system and then I'll whine for the rest of my life about the game being over-played. But for now I consider it a really funny little game that I would have happily bought at Essen if it hadn't been so obscenely over-priced.

RATING: 7
This game is a great set collection / drafting game with just the tiniest bit of engine building (not as much as I would like, though). Simple games are often made great by negotiation and table talk... too bad there's not any of that here. I don't buy into the hype that there is more here than meets the eye, but I do enjoy playing and it's an easy sell to non-gaming friends.

RATING: 4
This game has a very limited player count to be playable and that is 3.  Otherwise no matter you choices there is a player you don't interact with or have the ability to stop being a runaway winner.  That one feature really drags this game down as people always want to play this with larger numbers.  Do yourself a favour and play citadels instead in a large group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Fast playing, medium weight filler that can accommodate a large group of people. It’s a nearly perfect game for what it does, but it doesn’t really scratch that civilization game itch if that’s what you’re looking for.

RATING: 8
The design of 7 Wonders is just so clever. Rarely (but sometimes) have I encountered a game this simple yet having the possibility for quite many strategies. When you play your first game it can look confusing and complicated, but after that it's easy sailing. The end scoring involves some calculating. Then again there is virtually no downtime and it takes only half an hour.. kudos!

Keeping an eye on this. Sounds like the kind of game I've been trying to design (unsuccessfully) in a few projects lately.

Update: just watched the demo on Essen GeekBuzz. /cry -- it's exactly the kind of game I've been trying to design. It looks good.

Update: forgot to update this after I actually got to play it a few times. I like it quite a bit. It's not a deep Euro by any means, but for the length, weight and scalability, it scores highly with me. I'm a sucker for drafting, anyway, and it's mixed nicely here with "building" a resource foundation and scoring VP.

Great card drafting game. I really like that it handles 7 players and can finish in about 30 minutes. That is a really great attribute. This game is quickly becoming my favorite card game. I enjoy that I can play with 7 players, but I don't have to pay a lot of attention to what they are doing. It makes this game less of a headache to teach new players. Not to mention there are few games that handle this number of players well. This game seems to do it all.

It seemed intereresting at first, a game which could be palyed by more then 4 or 5 people, but for me it got very monotonous after some games. So for me its a NO.

After some time, I played quite a lot with it, with the leaders expansion, and we could play for hours. It won't be my favourite, but I will gladly play with it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
- The game is too complicated for non- or casual gamers, as it requires card deck knowledge to play well
- The game is not meaty enough for gamers, because beyond scoring and drafting there is very little game here
- At higher player counts, you can do very little to nothing to influence the players sitting far away from you
- Denying (the) subsequent player(s) cards he/she/they need(s) feels much more important than your own needs
- If you sit in passing order behind a player who knows what he/she is doing: good luck getting a decent score
- This does not feel like a civilization building game, the theme is pasted-on (the blue cards are especially creative ...)

At this point I'd say an 8.   Played a few times.  Most seem to get it easily and has fun and it plays well with large groups.  I know we will be playing a lot of this and using it as an intro game.

[b]Update:[/b]  Moving to 7.5 for now.  Has not always worked as an intro game.  I think not having a board and lots of options in the sense of end game made a few have problems.  They just had no clue what to do strategy wise for end game and it just wasn't fun to learn for them.  Don't quite have the desire to play this one as much as others, but still enjoy it a bit personally.

[b]Update: 12-22-2012 [/b] Leaving as is for now, but really questioning the replay value.  Last play it just seemed to be over really fast and both the wife and I just were not feeling engaged in the stategies especially with how quick it ended.  It had been a while though so won't change for now.  Maybe it has been a fluke.  

Still pretty decent and great to have since it fits a very specific niche being short, no down time and fitting 7 players.

When it comes to drafting games 7 Wonders is often the go to recommendation I hear. While it's not my favorite drafting game it certainly is a good one. Most of the rules are pretty simple, the components are nice and the the game doesn't take too long. Despite all the I still have some gripes. I feel like the trading cards can be a little complex for newer players and that after playing the game a handful of times it loses quite a bit of its replay value just because it can be a little boring. Other than that though it's always a fun game to break out once in a while.

A really chaotic card game with a pasted on theme. After a lot of good reviews from Essen 2010, I thought it would have a bit more depth. For my taste it's too chaotic and luck dependent and lacks a long-term strategy. Furthermore, you never know where exactly you stand as you can't relly estimate the points of the other players.

A really enjoyable game that so far I have enjoyed replaying as much as possible.  Very nice for the number of players that can play.  It is tactical to a degree, but more than anything it is about being adaptive.

My only issue with the game would be with the Guild cards.  Since which ones you see are random each game, you can't exactly plan for them and are just hoping you draw ones that can work for you.  You don't need them to win, but they can help you out a great deal.

Also, playing with a mix of experienced and inexperienced players is almost a nightmare since you can give away huge advantages to your neighbors.

7 Wonders has a feature that I think defines what I tend to like in games, what I'm going to call simple depth (simple-depth?). Games with this quality do not have simple and easy to teach, many games with this quality fail that test. These are games that have mechanics and depth, but not so much that they can not be contained within one's head.

7 Wonders I think displays this in the way players must evaluate which cards to draft and which to pass. With just a glance, it is possible to tell what my left hand and right hand opponents are likely to give me or what I take for myself and pass to them. Call it a Glance test. I love games that let me do that kind of thing.

Does its job well enough. Provided a fun distraction for a large number of players in a good amount of time. Something doesn't quite click with me to make this a classic.

Viszonylag könnyű szabályok, gyors játékmenet, akár heten is játszható. Ez már három olyan tulajdonság, ami mindenképp jó egy játéknál, emellett pedig teljesen rendben van a játék. Izgalmasabb, jobb, mint a Dominion, kevesebb mélység van ugyan benne, mint az RFTG-ben, de a témája és könnyebbsége miatt jobban eladható a kevésbé gémereknek. Kellemes, jó kártyás játék magas újrajátszhatósági faktorral. A szerencse szerepe ugyan nagynak tűnik az egyes csodák talán nem teljesen egyező tulajdonságai miatt, illetve a kártyák miatt. Mégis úgy érzem, a jobb játékos általában ki tudja küszöbölni ezeket. Gyanús, hogy akár 9-es is lehet belőle.

[2011-07-29]
20 játék után is kiemelkedő játéknak tartom. Üresjárat nem nagyon van, hisz egyszerre cselekszik minden játékos, a játékidő tényleg 30 perc, így több parti is követheti egymást. Kiegészítő nélkül is nagyon magasnak érzem az újrajátszhatósági faktorát, minden játék más. Azért nem emelem a pontját 9-esre, mert jelentősége van annak, hogy milyen két játékos ül melletted.

I was introduced to this wonderful game in a 4v4 tournament  of it arranged in my university's boardgame club and fell in love with it in first sight. The graphics, the comparatively quick gameplay, 3-7 players setup, strategy, luck... With one last place, one second place and 3 first place games, I won the tournament and thus won a copy for myself. It feels like such a great game. A great introduction to more strategic games yet can easily be picked up. I think I'll truly emjoy playing it at all times with all different strategies involving it.

A very good game mainly because of the draughting mechanic which is lovely. As in concordia, you only have between 2 and a maximum 9 options per turn which pretty fast reveals a total of only 2-4 best choices so anyone can feel like is doing the right thing but an experienced player will make the difference and stand out in most of the situations.
A good gateway game although the subtle things are hard to get by newcommers.

RATING: 9
Makes playing with a larger group straightforward because of simultaneous actions. The neighbour mechanic is very interesting, makes the game highly replayable, and rewards attention to detail on other players' development.  

Modular expansions keep the game fresh -- but can also add too many additional symbols and overwhelm new players.

Ancient history theme was conducive in getting the family to play boardgames!

While not really a 1...this is a joke entry.  I find this game mediocre at best.  The base game is a solvable system.  With more cards the game becomes crazy complex mathematically, but still suffers from the same reaction I had to the base game: you're not doing anything.  Every other game I play that has drafting, you're creating a hand or deck of cards to play out later.  This ultimately feels unfulfilling.

[i]Nice and Satisfying Quick Game with 3 Players... Gets Worse with More![/i]

Will only play with 3-4 players.

"7" is my rating as a 3-4 player game, base game only. Any different configuration I like much less, because the gameplay and strategy becomes pure optimization and luck when you cannot reliably predict or counter-draft your opponents

On the other hand, 3 player may be a little overly-analytical, but that's a euro for you.

Design is super-sharp, the thematic use of sevens is brilliant and awesome, and the artwork is absolutely beautiful.  The main problem is that weaker players tend to affect the game too much; a stronger player can be gifted too many points by players who fail to deny him important cards.  The drafting mechanic is clever, but also allows for some notable luck impact.  There is a lot more meat to the game than I first anticipated; navigating the resource game and that interaction with your neighbors makes for a surprising amount of depth.  I'm always up for playing this one, and it's grown on me substantially since the first play.

whoa - my oldest son said he likes this game.  That is a rarity, and gives an extra bump to its rating.  I'm suspecting he likes civ/city builder type games, and he likes this bec it's fast.  

my wife and youngest son don't seem to get it, so not sure if it will stick with the family.

This game is my number two all-time favourite game (right after "Race for the Galaxy"). Easy to teach, hard to master, quick to play, almost no downtime (I love games where you never have to wait for your turn, since all players perform their actions simultaneously) and the art looks fantastic.

It's video poker.

Pick the card you want from what you are dealt.  Repeat. See if you win.

An entertaining exercise, but not much of a game.

I kept wishing I was playing Fairy Tale instead.  Hopefully, this will encourage people to go back to that far superior game.

Thank you Secret Santa 2010 !!!  i really enjoy this ame - especially basedd on the length of the game - always quick & easy to setup.  I love the sharing of a hand mechanism - i think it is brilliant.  It is one of the best games at having to maximize what you can do based on what you have been given - It is nt always easy to have a set strategy which you can count on to win the game ... Your strategy has to evolve based on what everyone else is doing and the mix of cards you are able to select from.

Update 2016: After playing this a little more at a variety of player counts, I place this firmly in "Meh" terrain. I don't think I would ever suggest playing it, but I would oblige someone if that was group consensus. I would, however, actively avoid this game if there were 6 or 7 participants looking for a game. 

There are certain games, where I just can't get myself to care about the choices being made. I can't pinpoint why quite yet, but this game is among their ranks along with Kingsburg and a few others. I know there are strategic decisions to be made, however, I can't get myself to become engaged or excited by them.

7/12/12: I had a bad first experience with this game. I didn't like it at all. After playing it a few times, I'm warming up to it. I think it'd be best with 4-5 players. Possibly 3, but I haven't tried that.

Easy to play, fast, and fun. However, in no way does it feel like you're building a civilization. I like that you are only fighting with your neighbors (especially in a 6 or 7 player game where it would be difficult to see what everyone has), that you can "trade" only with your neighbors, and that you don't need to balance everything. Ben has.

Intriguing strategy involved in making sure that you get the cards you need from each hand in order to amass the most points. While you can win by focusing on certain aspects of your civilization, a rough balance, with one exclusion and one emphasis seems to work best. Make sure that you have access to the resources necessary to build 3rd Age cards.

After a few plays this game becomes really really stagnant.

Expansions make this game what it should have been from the beginning.

With Leaders, with Cities, with WonderPack, with every promo in existence this game becomes very good. I'll give it an 8 but I keep my 6 score because as a base game it's terribly bland and short lived.

Okay, there's a learning curve here.  For an experienced gamer, though, it's only about one game.  After the first game I knew everything I had to know and started to work on trying different strategies.  It was around that second play that I really fell in love with it.  Gorgeous game that plays really, really well.  I can't believe such an involved game can play seven people in 30 minutes, but it can.  This is one of the best games of the year, no doubt.  *Update* - 13 plays later and it's made my 10 list.  Absolutely love it.

My family's favorite. This game just clicks with so many different types of gamers (and even non-gamers sometimes). It is really quite nice that it plays so fast and keeps everyone involved all the time, no matter how many you play with. Oddly though, it's not my favorite game to play with more than 5 people. Reason being, with that many people all with there own board (and no center board all players use) I always get the feeling like i'm really only playing against the person to my left and right, and that there is kinda a whole other game going on at the other end of the table. So, really it plays great with up to 7, but just not my favorite with that many (I would choose something like The Resistance for 7). But, in the end though, it's a fantastic design by a really brilliant designer.

Fast, fun, tense.  Easy to learn, too -- it looks way too complex to be a gateway, but it is.  Multiple strategies that have to evolve and adapt as the other players' own strategies become apparent.  Not a ton of player interaction, but players that note what their opponents are doing and plan accordingly will do far better.  A quick, terrific, inventive game that everyone likes, for up to seven players?  7 Wonders should be on everybody's game shelf.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
7 Wonders is a surprisingly rich card drafting game. You play three hands of seven cards and each turn you pick a card from your hand and pass on the rest. The turn structure really is that simple. This way you try to build your own civilization and score the most victory points in various ways. A big part of the game is to set up a resource engine that will last your game plan through all three hands, or ages. The Wonders that give this game its name provide players with special abilities which really affect your play. 
Within the game you only interact with your direct neighbors. Mainly, the player interaction is limited to  passing cards, buying resources and comparing military strenght after each age.
7 Wonders is a highly replayable game that needs a few plays to really grow on you. The virtual resource mechanic needs some time to settle in and specific card knowledge helps a great deal to do well. I first rated it a six, but over time I kept adjusting its rating: now, it's one of my few 10 rated games. Games are quick, varied and really a lot of fun. The more I play, the more I want to play and that is probably it's best quality.

The Leaders expansion adds a great deal of strategy while not adding a lot to the complexity. It adds a smaller fourth hand, which you draft at the beginning of the game and which you keep for the entire game. At the start of each age you get to play one of these leader cards. Basically you plot out your strategy at the beginning of the game based on the leaders you're dealt and draft. Hate drafting now happens less often, but is more meaningful. Also, money becomes more important since leaders have to be paid with money. This is a great improvement from the base game, where money was only used for buying resources.

I'd say the Leaders expansion is a must have expansion, whereas the Cities expansion is a very good expansion, but not a mst-have per se. Instead of three hands of seven cards, you now play three hands of eight. The extra cards are a new type of cards which add some more direct player interaction. The new cards shake up your decision tree quite nicely.

The Wonder Pack is another must have expansion, as you can never have enough wonders for extra replayability. Also, these new wonders are awesome and some of the most fun ones to play with.

This is probably one of the top games from 2010.  It quick and fast and has really interesting cardplay interactions.  There are many paths to victory and a variety of different choices you can make based upon what your opponents are doing.

7 Wonders is one of our all-time favorite games. We love that it is a quick game, that everyone is playing at the same time.  It is easy to play a quick game, clean up and either move on, or play it again. The expansions add a lot of replayability, helping it continue to be fun.

Incredibly light card drafting game with a good theme and lots of decision making.

The first time I played, I loved it, but I lost badly because I didn't know the deck. By the third game, I knew what cards would be available, and I won. But by that time, I had long realized that I didn't deserve to win (or lose). The decisions aren't very interesting because you play your card as soon as you get it without knowing what else you'll get. It's also random-seeming at the end while scoring because there are so many ways to score VPs. I don't mind playing, and there's some good here, but it could have been much better.

A clever drafting game (also perfect as a gateway game). But it needs more than 2 players to have fun with it (the 2 player variant isn't good enough for us). Traded away.

RATING: 6

It's a civ-themed card drafting game. Players each choose a civ, each with a different power. There are 3 decks, one per era. The cards are in various types -- resources, VP cards, etc. Deal out 7 cards per player, then draft -- clockwise, then counter, then clockwise again -- playing one card at a time. Resources allow you to build the other cards; if you don't have a resource, you can buy it from left- or right-hand neighbor. In the end, you get VP based on your cards built, your civ bonuses, and military. The military is a bit tricky to figure out, since you score relative to your neighbors' strengths. 

I quite enjoyed my first game (3er), but the 5er wasn't as good: the military is not nearly as interesting, and there is absolutely no interaction with anyone but your neighbors. In both games, the end-game VP calculation was also a bit cumbersome, although worth the effort.

RATING: 7.5
Excellent drafting game that's fairly easy to teach and understand from a rules perspective. Repeated plays are in order if you want to maximize the fun of the draft and bump up the level of competitiveness.

There's virtually no downtime -- you're either drafting cards or playing cards simultaneously and resolving their effects. It also plays up to 7 players & due to the simultaneous play each player doesn't add that much time to the overall game.

[i]** Update Nov 2017[/i]
Now that I own the digital app & have played a ton of games against the AI (they only take ~5 minutes to play), I'm dropping my rating for the base game.  I didn't realize how simplistic the game really is. I still enjoy drafting and it plays quick, but I'm no longer clamouring to play. Blood Rage is now my #1 go-to drafting/area control game!

I have 7 things to say about 7 wonders
1. Its quick, real quick...dominion style quick. I'd say about 12.5 minutes per player, that means you could play it 7 times in a row if you wanted to
2. Its good looking, real good looking. The individual wonder cards are nothing short of magnificent! Almost as impressive as the wonders they represent, and the other cards are damn sexy as well. But, unlike most sexy things...
3. Its clever, real clever. I love the card drafting aspect as well as the fact that you have to purchase resources from your enemies (just like in real life)and everything about the gameplay is smooth and slick
4. Its has multiple ways to win, I love multiple ways to win!
5. Its quick to teach, like most quick games are i suppose. There are a lot of things going on, but its still surprisingly easy to teach, which is a plus
6. It has a high replayability factor. The fact that there are 7 wonders that each have two sides to play keeps it fresh for awhile, and with multiple paths to victory and a short playing time its bound to hit the table frequently
7.it has lots of cool expansions! Check em out, because like I said, they're cool.
8. I said I had seven things to say about 7 wonders, not eight, so back off.

I really enjoy playing this game.  It is a light game that is an excellent filler or can be played back to back for a longer gaming experience.  It has practically no downtime, great looking artwork, multiple paths to victory and accommodates up to 7 players.  Apart from the oversized box with terrible inserts this is a great production.

Replay value is lacking with this game.  I like the deck drafting mechanic and the game itself is beautiful but after a few plays it can get a little stale.  It's still a good, well-designed, and fun game that I enjoy playing though, especially after it's been out of the rotation a few weeks.

I do like how it is one of the few games that scales really well to different numbers of players from 3-7.  Too many games just accommodate different numbers of players but always work best with a set number.  This game plays just as well with any number from 3-7 in my opinion and 7 is a lot of people to accommodate for one game which is another bonus for large groups that want to play together.

Everyone enjoyed their first play of this.  Part way through my youngest said "this is fun!".  Rules were a little tough to get through but they weren't bad.  The scoring was tough to explain though.  Get through the first game and everything will click.  Not really that complicated.  The game play brought up a lot of table talk, "argh, I can't decide which card is better" or "you passed me this trash".  Everyone enjoyed it.

Introduced some non-gamers to this.  They were lost and confused but didn't give up on it.  One got it part way through.  I don't think they found it objectionable but they likely won't request it again.  This is not a good gateway game.

Great card drafting game. I would probably consider this a gateway+ as the some of the cards can be complicated for new players (for a card drafting gateway game I would recommend Sushi Go!). I love that there are multiple winning strategies in addition to starting with a different wonder each game, which adds to the replayability.

I have played this several times now and I don't think I have won yet. It keeps me coming back though. It's probably at its best with 4 or 5 players, when you get to see your original hand of cards again. Beyond that it's still fine, but feels more random since it's very difficult to influence what's happening across the table.

A sort of collecting card game with some really great mechanics. I like the drafting mechanism a lot, good balance of luck and strategy there. Another plus is the simultaneous game play, strategy games often come with down time when waiting for your turn and are therefor often not really suitable for bigger groups, this one works perfectly for even 7 players (which we played with) for that exact reason.
Resource management with buying goods from only your direct neighbors, a bit of military and cultural efforts to tend after; I really liked my first try at "7 Wonders" even though it took me a moment to get into it (as with some strategy games, the rules seem a bit overwhelming at first but with a few rounds played things fall into place). I assume better knowledge of the possible cards will help the strategy but we had very even victory points results in a mixed group of newbies and experts; I like it when games welcome new players and challenge people who know it at the same time.
Some complains on BGG are towards the low player interaction, whereas that is true I don't think every game needs that and I am not sure why that is minus, I like both type of games, the more solitary and the highly interactive ones.

This has worked well with 2 and 4, and I'd def. like to get it to the table with more. I really enjoy the quick gameplay of this, and it's smooth and intuitive as well.

The wonders are different enough, and the B sides particularly give you a nudge into a certain direction (though sometimes the cards you need for that just don't come up in the draft...). It's also great how you need to keep an eye on your neighbours - but only your neighbours - for how to get ahead; in one game Carla and I got the same points for military when I had 5 mili cards and about 10pts, and she only had 1, with exactly 1 point! - I lost the attrition battle to John, unfortunately :( - but it's great that that can happen and that there are so many ways to win - and that you can have a say in whether your neighbours get what they need too!

Lovely synergy of form and function, and you know how I love one of those!

Really?  This game is that popular?  While it works as a fairly quick filler, there isn't much strategy (very tactical) and not all that fulfilling.  After several plays, I have found that this game is just giving you the illusion of control.  That being said, it isn't the worst way to fill up a 30 minute gap with 4-7 players but there are many better fillers out there.

My favorite board game so far. Works equally well from 3 to 7 players (a BIG plus for my large but varying gaming group). Easy to pick up even for casual players, quick to play (one game lasts about 30 minutes), and in spite of all this it still allows for multiple (and well balanced) paths to victory, giving good variety/replay value. Correct planning and decision making is always rewarded, with good old luck being there just to mix up things a bit. All in all, a very FUN game, who can appeal to all audiences (from family/casuals to dedicated players) without pretending to be the best game ever made.

7 Wonders is fun and deserved of the hype for the most part.  It is an easy to teach and learn game that can accommodate up to seven players and it does this with little down time.  I rate it a 7 because of these things.  It is only a 7 however because of a few issues I have.   (My 2 plays were both 7 player games)  The card drafting mechanic was intriguing at first, and offers a meager attempt at player interaction, but it only exacerbates the inherent randomness of the game and it reduces the strategy to almost nil by only allowing short tern tactical planning.  

In the two games I played, during the third age every player immediately played the guild card if they were dealt one.  They are inevitably worth a decent amount of VP's and which one(s) you get to play is totally random.  There is no strategy in "play the purple card if you get one".   The green science cards are like a siren's song; the set collection seems like a good idea, but the payout is not enough.  It is easy to block by your opponents and you need too many cards to score enough to be worth more than the blue VP cards.  For example, in one game I collected a set of four of one type squared, that's 16 points, and then one of each of the 3, for 7 points.   So I invested 6 cards for a total of 23 VP's (not a good ratio in this game) and it would have been easy for my opponent to have buried the last card of the set, if he would have done that, I would have scored only 16 points for 5 cards.  Military is simply unbalancing in a 7 player game.  In both games I played, the winner had a mere one or two military cards played, but gained a significant amount of points because the person to the right or left chose not to play military; while the players on the other side of the table each escalated their military, causing a lot of investment with little or no payout. You see, it is almost a given that one player grabs a significant lead in military.  Let us say the player to his left decides, I can't compete with that, I will let him win military and I will concentrate my plays on VP's hopefully out gaining him in that manner.  But this allows the sneaky player to his left to play one military and gain the military points.   So it is the player two chairs away (or across the table) that gains the benefit of someone that invest heavily in Military.  

Most of my faults above would seem to lessen in a game with less players; you would be able to have more choice on Guild cards, you would be closer to the other players for military, you would see science cards more than once and it would be harder for them all to be buried.  So my score of a "7" is only for the 7 player game, I am interested to see if I am right and it is better with fewer players.  All in all it is a 7 as a 7 player game for me.  With its flaws it is deserved due to the easy of play the low downtime and the ability to engage 7 people at one time.

7 Wonders is a fairly quick-playing game with low interaction.  It scales well; the experience does not change much from 3-7 players.  The main difference is that in a 3-player game, when you pass your first hand, you expect to see most of the cards again.  With 7 players, you won't.

In my experience, most non-gamers find it fairly accessible, getting the hang of it halfway through the first play.  I like how you don't have to explain the guilds until the third age.

Of course, it's got a fair bit of chaos in it; it's certainly not a hardcore contest of skill like some heavy Euros.  The best player will not win every time.  That's fine by me; I like the way it feels.  A play of 7 Wonders leaves me feeling good, win or lose.

Drafting: the game!  More fun than it sounds and one of a very small set of games that scales to 7 players (and less than 8 hours to boot!)

It's actually quite dull on repeated play.

Update: 11/2016: This has been completely replaced for me by Treasure Hunters.

Simple drafting game that works well from 3 to 7 players without ever being too long. It is best with 3 as every player has a direct affect on the other players and doesn't use the fake player of the 2 player.

The drafting in rounds with scoring at the end and during turns allows you to try and build up a strategy so it isn't just turn optimization. The random bonus points at the end may not work out for you though. The wonders give you a direction to go.

Little to no downtime. Some player interaction but is still a set collection game so it can appeal to many types of people.

Is random and does take familiarity to play well, but otherwise as good as advertised. Amazing that it plays the same length regardless of player number.  Scoring is crazy fiddly, but, oh well!

A thoroughly enjoyable drafting game. The strategic options are enhanced even further by the interactions with players around the table. More than most games of its ilk 7 wonders has some nice asymmetry and multiple paths to victory that made each game feel, if not unique, at least interesting.

Plays fast and doesn't make me want to flip the table.  It doesn't last long enough to build a grand strategy only to see it destroyed by some stupid dice roll that is obviously cocked.

RATING: 7
Initial rating after four plays is that this is a good game and unique enough to garner a lasting place in our collection.  Is it worthy of the gushing praise, no, probably not, but it is good fun.  One of the main problems with it is something touted as a great thing--it is a civ-building style game which plays in under an hour.  However this, rather than good, is a distracting problem to me since the game loses the grand sweep of developing a civilization engine because it all happens so fast.  I think 3 hours is probably the sweet spot for our group for this kind of game, and if we had the opportunity more often, even longer civ games would be just fine with us.

So what you end up with is sort of a cliff-notes version of civ building game play.  But if you back up a bit from the theme and view it as just a game engine, it is quite a good game with interesting special powers and benefits to following any particular development tracks.  It's just that once you've got everything humming along in a fairly tight manner, boom the game is over.

I think perhaps the guild cards should be shown to everyone before being shuffled in, to allow players to attempt to capitalize on the ones included in any particular game...otherwise blind luck in developing along a certain path can yield a tremendous amount of points in the final turns.

One of the first drafting mechanic games that I ever learned and by far my most favorite. This game continues to be fun even if I come in dead last. There are several different strategies you can use to win so you are forced to adapt to the other players choices.
The most appealing part though, is that no matter how many people are playing, the game takes the same amount of time....except for that one AP person that needs to be slapped!

An ok drafting game, with almost no player interaction. No real challenge. It always needs some pressure to get me into playing.

RATING: 6
Light civilization-themed card game that's most notable for its very fast play and large player count. Depth decreases in inverse proportion to the number of players, but there's no downtime so it scales surprisingly well.

I soured on it after the novelty wore off. The main problem is that it usually gets suggested because there are six or seven players free; since it's at its worst with that many, I'd rather split into two groups... and with three or four or five players there are many other choices. Luck of the draw plays a very large role, increasing with the number of players, and the much-vaunted lack of downtime is harder to find with a full complement because there's always [i]someone[/i] slowing things down.

A little more interactivity than games like Dominion, but several problems with this game that seems to get played so often just because of the graphics and the short play:

The ability to buy resources from your neighbors without their consent or without effect on your own use of the same resources is a bit unrealistic and random, especially when playing more than 4 players, and important resources can be permanently out of your reach, and the game is too short to be able to modify one's strategy when resources are unavailable.  Also with more than 4, it is extremely difficult to watch what everyone is doing, and respond knowledgeably.

Fun pass-the-duchy-on-the-left-hand-side game that has enough to keep our gaming group wanting to always play it when it is suggested. A good superfiller that has enough for deck builders (most of my group) but without putting those off who just don't like deck-building games (me). There are several paths to victory and some nice player interaction of the 'but I wanted that!' variety. Good fun.

great game, bad quality

a fast and fun card drafting based civilization building game. great theme and beautiful art (same artist as Cyclades). easy to teach, plays fast even with a lot of players as there is almost no downtime. this all makes it fun and suitable for casual gamers but it's deep enough to be interesting for serious gamers as well.

one of the best games this year (next to Isla Dorada)

unfortunatly I cannot give it as many points as it would deserve because of the lack of quality. the card quality is really bad, as is the insert. the box is way oversized. it was a really bad decision to put a casual game in a non-portable box. also for this size they could have at least made an insert to separate the cards according to age and player number. what a shame...

Edit: 2011.09.: As much as I liked the game it got dull for me fast. It's still a great game for non-gamers to get into board-gaming but for me it's not that fun anymore.

RATING: 7.5
Elegant design... but it is lacking something. It has many advantages: It can accommodate up to 7 players, rules are quite short and easy to understood, and graphic execution is very good, if not excellent. It has some shortcomings, through: 2-player play looks like bit complicated (haven't tried yet), choices are simple (good for game time, but bad if you like to think deeper) and basically we play against two players only with almost no interaction. Good choice for large families (so I appreciate that someone published it!), quite nice filler for gaming meetings, but not a first-grade choice for me.

Edit: I've played it some more with my wife and good gaming pals and I think it started to click for me. If other players play it in more organized, focused way you also can gain more. Thus, rating raised.

Too random for my tastes, but it sure does seem to be popular and I'm willing to play along occasionally.

RATING: 7
[Asmodée 2010 edition] {Civilization; card-passing, drafting, resources management; optimal 3-4p} 7 Wonders is a fast-paced card games with civilization theme.  The theme is not as strong as I expected, yet ok.  Player interaction is good, esp. for 3-4p.  Age I is too important for a player to formula their game strategy.  Scoring calculation is a little clumsy, it would be better if a scoring track is provided, rather than a pack of papers.

The quality of components is good but the illustration is pedestrian. The conflict tokens and card illustration can be prettier.  The use of icon is good - players can understand the usage of each card easily without many references to the rules.  The coins are disaster. I expect nicer coins for a game with such an expensive price.

Początkowo nie wzbudziła we mnie entuzjazmu ale z każdą kolejną rozgrywką gra zachęca do tego by znowu zagrać i spróbować inneg taktyki. Wielką zaletą gry jest wielotorowe dochodzenie do zwycięstwa bo nie ma tu jednej słusznej recepty na wygraną. Początkowo liczenie punktów było uciążliwe ale po kilku partiach jest łatwiej, choć bez kalkulator jest ciężko. Chyba wiem zatem skąd te tytuły i wyróżnienia choć moim zdaniem 9/10 to chyba za wiele dla tej gry.

As a rule, I don't rate games I don't own, but after five plays, on the BGG rating, I'd give this a 3. It is a really poor game, and is too much of a memory game for me to get any enjoyment from it. I find it too taxing for what it is, and unrewarding in its execution. It is a copy and re-write of Fairy Tales with all of the good bits taken out, and lots of unecessary additions.

To the day I die, I won't understand the scoring method, and I've worked in accounts for over 20 years.

I find the game dull, repetitive, frustrating and irritating. I really struggle to understand why it is so popular - the only way of improving in this game is by memorising the cards, and there was nothing in game 5 I didn't see in game 1. For a supposedly 'light' game it could at least should be fun, but it is trying to be a grown up game in a child's package. I was looking forward to my first game of this, but couldn't have been more disappointed.

Look, if you like it fine, and maybe if I'd spent my cash on it, I'd be trying a lot harder to like it, but try Fairy Tale, or play Ascension or Dominion for some card based quick fun. In all the groups I'm involved in I saw this come and go pretty quickly.

Purchased 3rd Edition brand new (shrink) - 1 card (Age I, Lumber Yard 3+) missing (took 2 weeks to replace).

Being a wargamer, I like the historical theme, variety of Civ boards, and the Military Phase. The artwork is excellent (especially the Civ boards).

Very light (almost a party game), it doesn't hit the table that often as it has fallen out of favor. Glad that I didn't pick-up the expansions.

RATING: 9
Can't believe how fast and varied this game is. Over a dozen plays in and I just want to play more and more. It hardly ever seems like you are screwed by the cards. Very rarely do you get handed a pack with nothing to take. I like this best with less players though. With 5 or more it just seems too wild. The chances of getting a card to "table" back to you from your starting pack is too low for me. More players also tends to let people specialize a bit too much. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I initially rated this 8.5, and it's dropped every time I get a few plays in. I hope that downward trend stops before it reaches the point of total antipathy. 

Yes, it's appealing to have a game that has so little downtime, but ultimately 7 Wonders is a very misanthropic affair. It's idal for people to whom the idea of competing with other people is appealing, but conversing with them and looking them in the face is not. This is apparently a great many people. Its most ardent fans play it with the same no-chit-chat mindset of hard-drinking poker players solemnly mulling over their hands in a smoke-filled casino backfroom.

Surprised I never left a comment for this game. Anyway, it is an amazingly fun game in a short time. Repeated replays and it still is fun. The only complaint with the game is that it is a little too tactical and not strategic enough for my tastes. The "Leaders" expansion helps fix this, but the rules as written for "Leaders" is a little too luck based. Would enjoy if there was a larger pool of Leaders to draw from at the start.

I really don't think anything could improve on what this game delivers. You get empire building that increases in scale over time, but it's contained to around an hour. I've played this game many times and in the group I've played with, there is no guaranteed strategy to win, you have to pay attention to what's going on around you which gives it fantastic replayability.

I feigned away from this game for a great amount of time before my friend slapped it on the table and forced me to play.  I immediately became a huge fan and even bought my own copy!  It's quick. It can handle however many players you have.  The mechanics are simple enough that you can teach it to your friends in a few minutes and they'll have a good time while you delve into the deep strategy and combos all the cards have to offer.  I'm looking forward to the expansion of this one!

I own the Leaders expansion, Cities expansion, and Wonder Pack as well.

Most famous and award winning Card drafting game by Antoine Bauza.  Civ building card game.  2 player variant is okay, but better game is 7 Wonders Duel.  Play in 3 ages, building off previous ages, play against your two civ neighbors.  Many ways to score points.

7 Wonders is a great game in so many ways, and I think it is one of the few games that gives you the feeling of building an advanced civilization in under 45 minutes.

Point scoring is weird, though, and most of the time it is impossible to tell who is really winning until the points are scored at the end of the game.

Overall, a great game, with several minor flaws.

Also, there's really no need to buy the expansions. You're looking at a complete game here.

RATING: 8
It's a great family game with simple rules, short playing time and many options. However, there is a lot of randomness in the game making it hard to plan ahead. It's also hard if not impossible to tell who's in the lead. Both problems take a lot of strategic depth out of the game. Which is fine though, for a 30 minutes card game.

RATING: 8
This game is not perfect. I can see how it can be seen as really simple and rote, just another exercise in grabbing the card with the most VPs. That said, I really enjoy it! The card drafting mechanics are really well done, with the military and resource trade aspects forcing you to care about what your neighbors are doing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
First off, 7 Wonders plays really fast even with 7 players, since most of the action is simultaneous.

Its mostly a drafting game. The theme is pretty pasted on, but the feeling of building, trading and skirmishing with your neighbors is pretty good. I really enjoyed the fast play and feeling of construction.

RATING: 8
My wife and I love to play this game, it is one of our favorites. I think the brilliance of this game is how quick it plays with 2 players and it plays in the same time with 7 players.

There doesn't seem to be very many good strategy games that a large group can play in under an hour, including set-up and take-down time, but 7 Wonders is one of them.

The other thing I love about this game is how balanced it is. There are so many ways to win. The problem is, each game, I see multiple paths I could take and it is hard to discern what the best path is because I want to take them all!

The quintessential card drafting game. War is quite underpowered. Recommended for anyone just getting into board gaming. It's also a Euro that plays up to seven!!!

RATING: 8
Civilization themed card game with numerous paths to victory. Players are given an ancient wonder that they have to construct and cards that feature different resources and powers. Once a card is selected it can contribute in several different ways such as providing materials to help construct the building of the player's wonder, adding military strength, immediately awarding victory points etc. Players can also purchase resources from their neighbour on each side of them, thereby interacting with the cards that they have played. '7 Wonders' is a satisfyingly strategic game and there is a lot of player interaction, although that is performed primarily with your neighbouring opponents and therefore games within the game emerge if there are enough players. I do however feel that 'Glory to Rome' is a more accomplished game in this style despite not receiving the same amount of plaudits.

Laura's Rank (3/15) – 3.5 out of 5. Pros: I like the artwork. It's very different in the card drafting and the player interaction in other people seeing the cards being passed around. You are always pretty close and never can tell who is going to come out on top. Good length. Cons: My only con, and it is a big one, is that it is not that good of a two player variant.

Ryan's Rank (3/15) – 4 out of 5. I really like the mechanics. I really like the feeling of civilization building. The indirect player interaction was fun. Great artwork. Good amount of strategy. My con, like Laura, was the two-player variant. It works, but I don't like playing the free city. I think this would be a great game with more people, but with 2, it's good to very good.

I absolutely love this game but, unfortunately, am the only one in my family that does, so I don't get the plays in that I would like. I don't have any of the expansions but the base game is great on its own. The iconography can be an initial barrier to entry but not for long. I especially love how it plays quickly at all player counts though at the higher player counts you lose a little control over the entire game situation due to only indirect interaction with some of the players. Actual score 9.3

RATING: 8
Great first impressions but not a keeper.  
I should point out though that I no longer care for 7W itself. It's just not a very good game with 6 or 7 players and with less there's other games I'd rather play. It has that player order problem where if a player isn't actively disrupting their neighbors then those players have a significant advantage. Add to that the random card distribution and a good/bad shuffle can make/destroy your game and playing conservatively never works.

The more I play this with 6/7 players the less I like it and that's its whole raison d'être imo.

8>7>6

RATING: 7
The thing I like about this game is that it's easy enough to teach and it plays really relatively quickly so it's easy to bring to the table. However, I also don't like that it plays so quickly because the game doesn't allow players to really develop a long term strategy. Great for casual play, but not deep enough for those looking for a really strategic game.

Overall, it's a good game for casual play but not something I would actively seek out if I'm having a gaming night with avid gamers.

This is a card drafting game.  Each player plays one of the Seven Wonders of the World.  Each wonder has a different special ability.  Players simultaneously draft a card from their hand and pass the remaining card to the next player.  Cards drafted give players resources used to draft other cards or give players victory points.  The player with the most victory points win.

This game plays very quickly even with many players.  It supports up to 7 players and one of the expansions add an 8th player.  A game will take a little more than an hour to play even with many players.

RATING: 9
This game is pretty good, but it can often feel too much like multi-player solitaire.  The drafting aspect is nice, but it also kills long-term strategy.  It's definitely much more tactical than strategic.

With 4-5 players, this game is great.  The more I play it, the more I like it (it's moved from a 7 to an 8 for me).  Too many players makes drafting just a 1-time thing, but with 3-5, you will see more cards come back your way.  That gives it a more long-term strategy feel, and each player tends to distinguish him/herself.

Good intro to card drafting games, not too difficult to learn, but the reference sheet is handy for discerning what certain cards mean in terms of VPs. I enjoy the mix of solo drafting + being aware of what your neighbors are putting down as well since they have an effect on you at the end of each round. Each player/civilization board has an A side, for beginners or playing with the same build-your-wonder conditions, and a B side, for more specialized wonder-building conditions + rewards. Personally I find some of the civ-specific rewards a bit lackluster at times.

A két kiegészítő: Leaders és Cities kötelező darab hozzá, sokat dob a játékmeneten és kevésbé válik monotonná tőlük a játék.

This is a big purchase mistake for me, while im still new in boardgaming (starts collection in 2013) this is one of my first purchases and is on top family games ranking, but drafting and explaining symbols to new peoples just dont get exciting and appealing as playing a real boardgame with board and components... the big bix doesnt justify the space compared to the lighter other draft games that just need a little deck box, im going to let this go, learned from my mistake and from that point, I watched review and gameplay before i buyed a new boardgames...

PS: I do alot of draft in Magic the gathering since 2000, so its nothing new for me, and doesnt give me an unique mechanism thingy for this game

Finally acquired through a trade.  Now I can explore it further.

Thoughts on 2 player : It works and is not as fun but it does give me a better understanding of the game.  As soon as my wife gets a better hang of it we can start using the free city to our advantage (for screwing your neighbor and getting points).

update : We have a handle on how the free city can be used to your advantage.  With it's free build requirement you do get screwed out of certain cards as you would in a full game.  Kinda neat.  We are exploring strategies now.

update : There's something addictive about playing this game.  I really enjoy 3 player.

update: Unfortunately I think 7 Wonders might have run it's course.  We never pick it anymore.

Certainly not bad and I'll play it again but probably not thrilled about it. It has an almost perfect time frame somewhere about half hour or less. It acommodates quite a few players and is quite sociable. However, there's not much to do other than draft a card and hand off the pile to the next person. Players next to you will have an effect on you, but stuff going on the other side of the table is pretty much out of your control. Worse yet, its difficult to look over there and see what other people are doing. I hate that, when the info is publicly out there but it's too hard to really figure it out. That part is annoying.

7 wonders is a light fun game, but it lacks player interaction. You interact with the player to your left, and the player to your right, but you can basically forget about the other players around the table.

Plays differently with different numbers. 5+ is satisfying because your building. But you don't have as much control over the cards. 3 and 4 are the sweet spot for this game. There is more tension and thought over what cards to pass. With 3 players I've passed cards I wanted to build but figured I had a good chance of getting them back since I was in the best possition to build them cheaply or for free. Plus I think with fewer players the military is more of a threat; with more players it's more possible to build military late and take some easy points.

You are the leader of one of the great cities of the past. Each city has different special abilities which influence your strategy.

tl;dr: still a joy to play

This game was an instant hit when it came out. And it has since grown into a bit of an evergreen. The expansions have injected new life into the game every now and then but while I enjoy them, none of them have wowed me. But the base game still stands out as a great design. It plays fast, has quite easy rules but offers surprising depth strategy wise. Overall I still enjoy this game an awful lot. Maybe because I never played it to death.

7 Wonders was an impulse buy and a game I originally knew nothing about. I was just trying to fill up my gaming shelves, and it was suggested at some point by a friend.

A few weeks went by, and eventually, I broke it off my shelf, gather a couple of friends and got to playing. 

It's a simple, but deep draft game, with multiple levels of strategy/counterplay and options to choose. Score-counting at the end it annoying, but otherwise, the only downfall of the game.

Played once with five others. They did a horrible job of explaining/teaching me before and during the game. After a couple turns I just randomly passed cards to the next player. I don't mind card drafting but this game seemed like it had too much going on. Even with the bad experience I'm not sure I'd try this again anyway. 

Update (June/2017): Played it twice more and they taught it very well so it was a much better experience. Still not sure I like it but if they bring it out again I would play it and see if it finally clicks (plus they said some expansions help).

I love drafting, especially Magic. This game is a good drafting game, but even though it scales nicely and plays quickly, I have to say I prefer Fairy Tale over this and I didn't play Fairy Tale all that often.

Great mechanics and theme, but for me, it isn't a game I need in my collection.

This one took a while for me to warm to, but once you get the hang of what you need to do 'well', the real fun comes from doing that, while denying your neighbours what they really need.

Multiple paths to victory make this an interesting game, if played at sometimes too fast a tempo.

In my first (and only, so far) game, 7 Wonders seemed extremely chaotic.  There's no telling what will be handed to you, and often times you can't buy the cards you want.  While I think there is something to it (beyond our learning experience), my friends weren't too fond of it.  I suspect it won't get played again unless I pitch it in a different light.  Perhaps with the Leaders...

RATING: 7
Interesting little game, with a couple issues.  It took awhile to understand the tech trees of which blue cards go into which next age ages.  Same with green science cards.  Purple guild cards being unknown until age 3 also makes things tricky as these cards add a ton at the end and will decide games, but you won't know which ones will be there to work toward.  Not really sure on balance between wonders.  Also, resources are not equally valued, stone is awesome, the loom is awesome, whereas other resources are less so.  But you won't know this unless you read up on the game a lot, or through a lot of trial and error understand the build paths.  Nonetheless, a fun game.

There's a lot to this little game.

For a game that plays so insanely fast, and has so many good and interesting decisions.  I am very, very impressed.

I think this one will be a keeper for a good while, but only time will tell.

Edit: Over time.  This one gets less fun.  Everything feels the same.  You can keep it fresh with expansions and all, but really in the end, it still feels the same.  I'll play it, but I'm not interested in seeking it out and trying new things with it or anything.

An excellent game which is a bit confusing at first but has so much more strategy to it than meets the eye. Not amazing at portraying the theme but not bad at all considering its a euro.

This is one of the few good games that allow up to seven players without any downtime for any player.  Each player plays simultaneously, but there's no direct interaction.

This game always has a lot of plays with my gaming group, and even though It's a great game, it probably wouldn't get played as often if it wasn't for the fact I'm usually teaching this to the noobies that come to our groups... This might be one of the best "gateway" games out right now. So it comes out more based off the fact that it's extremely easy to teach. But don't get me wrong, I'm a HUGE fan of this game, can't wait for future expansions!

"Filler" came to my mind as well when I first played it. I can see that it can get deeper with 3-4. It's like RftG - first few games I played, I hardly every paid attention to what everyone else was doing. After i got used to the symbols and figured out what were the unique worlds and 6-devs, it became a lot more interesting to watch what everyone else is doing. 

I feel that once we are more familar with the types of Guilds (6-devs), and unique cards are out there, it'll be more interesting to play, and if played with 3-4, it'll give you a lot more incentive to see what everyone else is doing.

You have limited drafting opportunities with 6p which is how I've been playing this. But even with all that, it's still a filler game.

Interesting game, vaguely like Glory to Rome: Get materials, build stuff, try to optimize points. Plays very quickly, even with seven. I'm unsure about its staying power.

Unfortunately, to play it well you have to play it enough to sort through all the individual cards and figure out which strategies are better than others in particular situations. It's a lot of work for a filler.

I know, 7 wonders a 7?  Did I do that on purpose?  Well, not really.  I like 7 wonders a lot, the idea of playing simultaneously and theme works out great.  My biggest complaint is there is a lot to keep track of for a shorter game which is particularly annoying because of the pacing given that cards are played at the same time.  The game also has a snowball feeling where things can get completely out of control and out of your hands.  I have never come out of this game absolutely wowed, but it is solid and decently fun.  Worth a shot if you are looking for a nice medium length family game.

Edit-Played with more players and it felt almost like a different game, upped the rating a little bit and will probably play more if the people seem like they will enjoy it.

Fast and clever card game! One of the future (or should I already say present?) stars in the boardgames world :D
However, the quality of the cards could have been better at this price. Sleeves are a must, but, surprise! The size of the cards is a bit unusual and you won't find sleeves easily.... This is why it gets an 8.5 instead of a 9

Update: played a couple of games with 6 and 7 players (the first ones were with 3). Still good but I dislike the lack of interaction between too distant players. Looking forward to play it with 4 or 5 as I think these might be the best numbers for it.

A solid drafting and tableau building game. My favorite mechanic in the game is how certain cards from a previous age will allow you to build a card in the current age without needing to meet the relevant resource requirements. This makes the drafting much more interesting (and makes the hate drafting that much more important).

Many people cite this as an excellent gateway game, but I disagree. The drafting mechanic is quite easy for non-gamers to pick up. However, the symbols (especially) and scoring can be quite obscure for non-gamers. Sushi Go or Sushi Go Party provide a much more accessible drafting experience for introducing people to the hobby.

While I still enjoy this game, it has fallen in my rankings because it starts to feel somewhat monotonous after a while--of course, there are many expansions that likely help bring back that freshness and diversity in the gameplay. Moreover, there are other tableau building and drafting games that I have started to enjoy more. 

Nonetheless, this game will stay in my collection for the foreseeable future since it is one of very few games that have a decent amount of strategy and can be played in a relatively short time even with a high player count.

This is a good drafting and card combination game that handles up to seven players without getting longer.  The action is simultaneous, and only your immediate neighbors can really influence you, so even with seven players, only three really matter.  As with most drafting, you have to keep an eye upstream to make sure the cards you want won't be cut off, and to compare military strength with your neighbors as well.

7 Wonders has become 15 Wonders.

Any game where you can take simultaneous actions already has an advantage over other games. Anybody learning the game can be in their own personal bubble and do just fine. The more you play, the more you start watching others.

Great fun, very repayable.

Leaders is a great expansion that just simply adds more to the game. Cities add a bit of meanness. 

The base game is probably still best.

RATING: 8
I admit, it took a few plays to like this game. At all. But it grew on me. I'm still not good at it, but I do (sort of) like the tension with each draft of "what can I give up this time...?"
But it is handy to have a game that fits a smaller timeframe, and suits at least 6 people.

RATING: 7
Not the second coming some were saying it is. Instead it's a bit of seen-that-been-there -game with very little novelty and almost no interaction whatsoever. I don't feel the tension while I'm playing, there's too much money available and practically nowhere to spend it in addition to buying something from your opponents. You just pick a card after another and see if you'll win.

Nevertheless, I can play this without complaining. It's not the worst game available, just hurt by immense hype.

I really like this game, but I am terrible at it. I feel that you need to rely on your neighbours to a certain extent. One of my major complaints, as has been mentioned elsewhere, is that the choices seem to become less and less compelling as the game goes on and by the Third Age there are likely some choices which you just HAVE to make, logically.

RATING: 8.1
Only played this once so far, but I've a feeling it's going to get a lot more plays in the coming weeks. Rarely has a game appealed to everyone in our group equally; it seems that everyone loved it, and I'm in agreement. For such a quick game there seems to be a lot of strategy involved (though I do wonder if the strategies might become a little shallow after a fair number of plays).

Edit: Played a fair few games of this now, and still really enjoying it, although the strategies seem less deep than when I first played.

Edit: Played loads of games of this now, and the Leaders expansion too. I see no signs of getting bored of it yet. It just has an amazing amount of depth for such a quick game.

This has been my first real introduction into strategy gaming.  I bought it to possibly use in class and then when I enjoyed it I got a second one and we actually play it as a reward at the end of a culture project on the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World in a class that I teach.  The students really enjoyed it also.  I tried explaining it to some thirtysomething friends and it was an hour and a half disaster that only got through the second age.  Then I explained it to 13 year olds who immediately picked up on most elements of the game and played through a full game in 25 minutes.

A wonderful game.  It's really changed how I look at every other board game.  Simultaneous turns give short play times, and you're happy about every decision you make, even when you lose.  It's really hard to want to play a 2 hour game - even a good one - when I can have just as much fun - and sometimes more - in 30 minutes.

I like the fact that there aren't really turns.  Its constant action unless someone (usually me) is taking too much time to decide.  However, its a completely different game when there are more people (5-7) versus fewer (2-4).  I think there's more strategy at the less person level.

An "ancient" card game that looks challenging, but is actually very quickly learned and holds the excitement until the end. Reminds me of Race for the Galaxy (symbol language), Peloponnes (theme, resources & some building rules) and Notre Dame or Citadels (draw 1 card and pass on the deck). Great both as a filler and a main attraction with several games in a row - easily accomplished as it's slightly addictive too!

First I didn't think I'd want it because auf the extrarules for 2 Players.
But after playing it some times with 4 or 5 players I realized it's a must buy.

Fast gameplay - nearly no downtime. Easy learned. Still some theme.

I only think it isn't a "game for an evening" but more a filler if you got an hour or even only half an hour.

I'm really enjoying 7 Wonders. So much that I'm brealing a loose rule and rating this a 9 after my first few games (I typically give a game no higher than an 8 until it's really shown its staying power). Given that 7 Wonders plays so quickly and accommodates up to seven players, I'm pretty sure this one is going to carve out a niche in the meaty filler category.

This is my top choice game when playing with a bigger party (6 or 7 players). 

The game has simple enough rules to grasp them in the first round of play after a short explanation. It plays fast and easily, even with 7 players: as everyone take their turn together, there is almost no down time. The game lets you make meaningful decisions every turn, based on the cards you have in hand, your "strategy" and the situation of your neighbors. It stays tense until the end of the game, even if it can be clear earlier who is taking a lead and will certainly win the game.

I've played 7 Wonders a number of times because other people want to play, but this really is not the game for me. I don't feel like I get the chance to make interesting decisions because I don't feel like I am really in control of whether I win or lose. It feels like the card deal is what determines that more than the play of an individual.

I'm ok never playing this again.

Addictive game with some initially fiddly set up (removing cards from each deck dependent on the number of players). Very well designed, easy to pick up and play. This is going to be huge. The only problem we found was the rule preventing a player from building the same structure twice as it was easy for players just to focus on the powers and resources needed. In each of the 3 4-player games, we had at least one person build the same structure twice, which skews the outcome. Great game nonetheless.

This is one of those rare games that plays equally great with 4 or 7 players AND doesn't take any longer with 7 than with 4. One nice thing in a 3 to 4-player game is that you get to see some of the cards twice, which lends a little more strategy. Every board is different, every game is different!

Best to teach this in stages. Only go over the types of cards encountered in the 1st Age before Age I. Then just before dealing cards for Age II, explain the pre-req aspect and the new cards. Before Afe III explain Guild cards and other new types of cards. Helps prevent information overload in new players.

This game is a keeper. It gets to the table regularly and is a perfect Gateway-Game with short playtime and high replayability. Especially the expansion "7 Wonders: Leaders" adds to it.

I once read the gameplay compared to sitting in a knitting circle and comparing your results at the end.  I thought that was fairly apt.  Of course you do have to pay some attention to what your neighbours are doing, but primarily you just do your own thing.

RATING: 8
Terrific! because it is stunningly beautiful and easy to learn + fast to play. But I have one issue with it and only time will tell if I'm right about this. I dislike the pyramids of Gizeh or better said: their special power when building your wonder. The victory points are nice, but it's extra-expensive to build the monument and there's nothing that helps you build your engine. Everyone else has a "power" that enables them to purchase buildings, culture, trades, guilds, war machines and science more easily (all worth - well, most of them - victory points on their own). Now if you would need less resources to build your monument or if the last step of the monument was worth more than anyone else's last step (i.e. 10 victory points) then this might work. For now I consider the Egypt player's "power" a disadvantage.  

Oh, and one more thing. Quite a few times, I saw people mention this is a Civ-building game. I fail to see that. For me there's no feeling that I actually build up a civilization. Most of the times I was thinking in terms of: "Ok, I have four brown cards, opponent X has 2 and Opponent Y has 3 - how many green cards or blue cards do they have in play? I wasn't thinking "who runs the senate/ where is the school/whose realm is defended by the wall?" It's a great game with great illustrations, but rather set-collection in perfection. Probably this will displace Ticket to ride as a gateway game. It is shorter and stil much more rewarding.

Ancient civilization-building card game based around a card-drafting mechanic. Sort of like Fairy Tale with scoring that makes more intuitive sense and cards with a stronger theme. Each of the different kinds of cards make sense and give you lots of paths to victory... plus, 3 to 7 players all go at the same speed.

The variety of cards and complexity of things like science scoring really hurt this game's score. It's just not the intro game it needs to be.

Super interesting and fun game that also plays well at pretty much any player count (3+) and is also easy to pick up but hard to master? Yes please. Might be the most well rounded game ever. My only complaints are 1. "upgrade" abilities of cards are needlessly difficult to track and poorly placed on the card. (7 Wonders Duel fixed this by using symbols which is a big improvement) and 2. The "can't play two copies of the same card" rule is annoying (it only comes into play at higher player counts (6-7) and is only necessary because otherwise Science would be OP) but I suppose that's the risk you run with Blue/Green cards. I understand why the rule is there and why the duplicates are there but its a small smudge on the game for me.

Still a really, really good game.

RATING: 6
I feel that this game has cemented its place as a blend of introduction game vs strategic game. Explaining a game to a new person takes time and there always seems to be a rule broken or two (Cards with the same name built, confusion on resource production, how to build a wonder). However they still seem to enjoy the game a ton.

I like watching other plays on their turns and seeing what they do, but too often everyone just lays down their cards and the game continues without discussion. Even with the interaction with adjacent players, it feels like something is missing.

I don't like playing this with higher player counts. You won't see any of the cards again during the draft. I'm not convinced that the cards added for each player count scales appropriately. Also, your seating position can really hurt you in this game. For 3-4 players, I enjoy playing this

Excellent idea.  The game flies by and there's always something to do.  Near-perfect filler game.

RATING: 7
This is a spectacular game. It feels like Dominion, but it isn't. It's a Civ game, but it's not. It's complex, but easy to grasp. There are several paths to victory, but it plays quickly. Go get this game.

UPDATE: The more I play it, the more I realize that there's still a lot of luck-of-the-draw in this game. It's hard for anybody to really get "good" at 7 Wonders. It's become one of my favorite games to convert non-gamers to the hobby. But it's definitely becoming lighter and less satisfying with time. I'm bumping my rating down from 8.5 to a flat 8.

UPDATE: I'm bumping it yet again; down to a 7.5. It's definitely not standing the test of time for me. I still consider it a good converter game, though. So I'll probably keep a copy for that aspect alone--I spend a lot of my time introducing non-gamers to good games.

This game is much better the second or third time around with the same group. Some people don't like the fuzzy victory conditions, but I like the fact that this allows you to change on the fly if you have to, or block an opponent scoring big without completely running yourself amok.

I don't get the hype. Yeah, it's fast, and yeah, it's slick that you can play with seven players. But the player interaction is so minimal that I fail to find much actual fun here. I think I'd like it a little better if the various resource types actually had some sort of strategic significance, so I didn't feel like I was picking them at random and then hoping to get appropriate cards later.

Seems like a solid game, but I need more than 5 plays to really understand it. I think it's more fun with fewer players, since there's more strategies that way.

RATING: 7
Fun game for gamers and non-gamers that scales well from 3-7 and plays in 30-45 minutes.  It even travels well! This versatility is a dream for someone that plays games with a lot of diverse crowds in a lot of diverse locations. 

Update: The rules explanation makes this sooo hard to get to the table with new players.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 5
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 2

Overall - 2.5

Again the iconography makes for a frustrating first game, but 7 Wonders is also tough the first game since early decisions affect you in the later game.

I love the game design of 7 Wonders but there are very few 'fun' or social moments. It's enjoyed by everyone but not something anyone strongly wants to play.

I prefer the base game on it's own and don't play with the expansions.

I love that the game keeps a brisk pace and scales amazingly. The last game we played (our 2nd game) all of the players at the end were within 1-4 points of the victor and we were all playing a different strategy. Real fun game and will hopefully only get better each play!

"One more game." --That's what your friends will be saying after you complete a round of 7 Wonders. This game combines civilization building with a great card drafting mechanic that forces you to be constantly aware of what your neighbors are doing. The scoring system is similar to Ra.

Oh, and you can play with 7 players in 30 minutes.... great game.

A Classic, the face of the card drafting subgenre

I want to give it a 10 but i feel the game needed more expansions like cities, that just added MORE CARDS.  Replay value can become an issue.

Otherwise: Amazing
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
After having played this a few times I have lost interest in pulling it out when other choices are available. The game is too random for my taste and I'm not a fan of the passing based card drafting mechanism used to drive building options. 

I still like to use this as a fallback for newer gamers or for people who don't care for heavier strategy games. The variety is good and this is not a bad game, it's just not what I prefer when given a choice of what to play.

Love playing this with our family.  I enjoy that it scales well for more players so we can all play.  The science scoring can be a little complex but if you grab the scoring app it mitigates that.  Generally simple enough that our kids can play (starting at age 10 anyway...younger might need coaching).

RATING: 6.5
Light civilisation game with card drafting, 18 actions in the game, and interaction only with your immediate neighbours

It's very light and tactical, not wholly offensive, but once you get past explaining the symbols (particularly for scoring) and trading, it's a game you can play with 6 or 7 people in a reasonable time. It's also fun with 3 or 4 (and a bit more thinky)

This has been popular with casual game players who are willing to put up with a bit of rules explanation. I think they enjoy the feeling of development through the game, as your earlier choices impact what you do later.

Fantastic drafting game that's quick to teach but the strategy runs deep enough that you will keep coming back for more. A few members of my group found this a little hard at first but after the first play through and we did the scoring everyone had that eureka moment and wanted to get straight in and play again. This will hit the table often as everyone in the group enjoyed it and i cant wait to pick up some expansions for it.

*moved up from 8 to 9 - I am enamoured with this game this could go up to a perfect 10 for me.

RATING: 8.5
Well designed game that plays fast, offers just enough differentiation in strategies and has very good art.

It's easy to teach, the only difficult concept is trading for resources, some people struggle to understand what that really means.

The base game mains a level of simplicity that makes the game approachable for everyone and playable in a half an hour.

Plays up to 7 people which is a really nice touch and even the 2P variant I have found to be pretty enjoyable.

This is the game that transformed me into a hobby enthusiast, rather than a casual player. Coming from a background in Magic: the Gathering, the drafting was very appealing to me. This game hit the table A LOT  when I first acquired it. Both with family and friends alike. It continues to do so years later. One of my favorites.

This game is great for the fact that it seats 7 players and still plays in 45 minutes. Gameplay is quick and fun and the draft mechanic is used very well here.

This game suffers from over-inflated expectations for me.  Initially, I was excited about the prospect of an ancient-civilizations-themed game which actually solves the "large numbers of players" problem through parallelization.  But the resulting game just has too little choice and too little depth for my liking, not to mention classic "arms race" problems in the military aspect.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
It's an elegant drafting game, it's pretty, it supports a great range of players and it's all about making the best of each of your 18 card choices. It's also quite fast.

There are several balanced paths to victory, and success depends on how well you can read your opponents. The rating is for the 3-4player game, I'd rate it 7.5 with 2p and 8 with 5-7p.

I don't play 7 Wonders enough to learn all of the icons, so they are always a pain to decifer, especially in the third age, and because I play it so rarely and don't really have too much fun play it, I don't really have too much fun with it and don't play it all that often.

The game rules are easy to learn, except for the icons. The game play is fine, but not good. I am not bored or overwhelmed play it, but it doesn't really pull me in. The theme is a bit pasted on (why are our civilizations passing a resource around? At least with Sushi Go, you could say it is a conveyor belt).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
What I like:

-This game is just great for what it is: Light, fun card drafting with quite a bit of random elements so everyone can win. It's not the most strategic game but that just means that everyone can play and have a chance. Nice theme, looks good, quick and fun. 


What I dislike:
Well, maybe the symbols could have been a bit more intuitive to teach and learn, and if you are into heavy strategy like me, you might not wanna play this all all the time. But for what it is, it's quite perfect.

RATING: 6
I love drafting Magic: the Gathering, and I've enjoyed drafting in the board game Notre Dame, but 7 Wonders taught me that I do have a limit when it comes to drafting games. It's simply too dry. There's too short of a connection between your choices and the final victory point total. Blue and purple cards are worth points directly. Green cards are worth points according to a sliding scale formula. Red cards are worth points based on a prisoner's dilemma with your neighbors. Brown, grey, and yellow cards are worth points in as much as they allow you to build the other cards. And that's it. That's the whole game.

It's nice that it's a fixed-length game that can support up to 7 players, but that comes at too great a cost.

To have any amount of depth, 7 Wonders needs its expansions.

An interesting card drafting game that in no way what so ever should be compared to Dominion. Not so sure why it's getting that at all as the play style have no resemblance to Dominion at all. Definitely a solid game by it's own right however and fun to play. I would like to try this with a larger group as I think it would interesting to see what come around to you as opposed to trying to pass a card and see if it makes it back to you. 

UPDATE: After playing this a few more times I'm less into it. I don't like the lack of interaction between players on the other side of the table. Perhaps expansions will fix this with "Far Reaching Markets" or something. Too often you can get screwed on resources you need. 

UPDATE: I finally got to play this 3 players and I think the game really shines right here. Yes it can hold 7 but doesn't have to. At 3 players it's super fast and you have to pay attention to your neighbors even more closely as the cards you see you will be seeing twice. Also pay attention to what they developing and you can try to make your civ unique scoring points that they are leaving behind.

A great game for introducing non-gamers to the next level of strategy gaming. I consider it a step-up from Settlers/TTR/Dominion/etc. The game is just solid. It uses the neat mechanism of card drafting, which forces you to make tricky decisions. This game is very much a "point salad" game. So many different sources for VPs. The nice thing is, each strategy appears to be valid. I have seen winning civilizations with all kinds of different tableaus. It is well balanced, and easy to pick up. Good game.

Fun the first two times, then grew desperately old... My game group felt the same, and we are not really hard core gamers.

Way too few options, and you don't feel like you are building much af an engine. It is Less a strategy game and more of more an optimal path system, that you quickly get locked into because of decisions early in the game. 

Nicely done graphics, but I barely pay notice to them in the game.

Good drafting game with extremely little downtime and an enormous player range. Variety is also quite good but attempts at an overall strategy in this game are often foiled by diminishing options and the drafting nature. Always fun to play though, and always fits in timewise.

Really fun game which features multiple paths to victory.  Simple mechanics once you figure out the icons, etc.  The artwork and theme are top notch.

EDIT - 1/29/2013 - The "new car smell" is off this game for me.  Yes, I enjoy Seven Wonders and will play if it is on the table, but overall it isn't really grabbing me.

The game seems very insular to me.  Yes, you can absolutely see what people are doing around the table and act accordingly, but unless you are really into set-taking games it just isn't a lot of action.

Not a bad game, just not one of my favorites either.

When you've got a group and not a lot of time, 7 Wonders is the game for you.  It can be overwhelming on the first play, but once you've got it down it's a good game.  The worst criticism I've heard of it is that it gets overplayed.

RATING: 7.5
Got this to add another highly ranked (yet fairly light) game to my collection and also because I'm looking into civilization-themed games.

The game is pretty slick and easy to play, but as a civ game I'd like a bit more connection to the theme. Most of what you do, in terms of thinking, is deciding which card to draft on a given turn, and there's really no thematic justification for the drafting mechanism. The most thematic thing is the arms race with your immediate neighbors. Most cards you play reduce costs of a later card or have some synergy with what you've already played (built). Science is reduced to a set collection game, which is pretty abstract.

The player interaction seemed just OK to me, coming not just from the arms race but also because you can try to draft cards you think someone else will want, blocking them.

I thought it was odd how the third (of three) eras has no new ways to get resources. You can't stockpile resources (except money), so if you don't produce enough of something, and your neighbors don't produce enough for you to buy and make up the shortfall, you can be quite sure, 2/3rds through the game, that you'll never be able to build certain things, such as stages of your Wonder!

I was disappointed by the lack of differentiation among player positions. I think games will start to seem samey pretty quickly. Over the course of the game you'll play approximately 6x3=18 cards. There are only about five general types of cards. This leaves room for (probably) a few broad strategies, but you're never going to find yourself in a particularly strange or surprising position.

...Upping .5 point to 7.5 after playing a thrown-together variant where I just mixed all the eras and then only played 4 cards per era instead of 6. It definitely wrecks some of the balance, but it was exciting and felt much less scripted.

...Tried playing where instead of drafting normally, there's a market and you put chips on the cards you want to skip over as in If Wishes Were Fishes. Adds some fiddliness but probably also some strategy.

...What I like most is the economy (deciding which resources to have for yourself and which to pay other players for) and after that, the majority game of military. I wish science and VP buildings had interconnections with something else in the engine.

RATING: 9
A great game that plays up to 7 players, with no detriment at all to the game, since you all play at once.

I would say this is only an 8 because you are dependent on the cards you have available to you to draft.  You may get someone purposefully (which is part of the game) preventing you getting other cards, but you may have others who are not stopping anyone getting any cards...so you get it from both angles.

With the Leaders expansion though it's a 10, as you have a bit more focus and there's a bit more to the game that gives you just that little bit more control.

A favourite! 
It's easy to learn and very rewarding to play.

You have a "tech-tree"-like advancement by card placing and competite with your neighbours by the simple fact that you contol the cards they get. It's effordlessly balanced by the fact that you only directly interact with your left and right neighbour.

Good albeit somewhat confusing game to play. The confusion comes from so many possible ways of scoring, as well as only interacting with the people next to you. This means that with more than three players you do not really interact with one or more of the other players. That said, it is an enjoyable game and doesn't take long to play. (Good 3 player game).

Everything I could want in a game. 

+ Very little downtime with players taking their turns at the same time
+ Lots of variability with each of the seven wonders having two sides
+ Scales amazingly well with more players; especially interesting is how interaction changes as the amount of players increasing
+ Interesting dependency mechanism that allow you to build cards that follow on from previous cards without having to use resources
+ Very good quality components and fantastic artwork
+ Easy to follow rules
+ Excellent strategy play with many ways to win; although balance seems to be the key
+ Keep you on your toes as you have to watch what other people are building and what resources they may need
+ Brilliant replay value

Certainly our favourite game in our collection.

Played this for a while now - 

I enjoy the card drafting and it is a great 'filler' or beginner game with people - though my true 'gamer' friends and I don't ever get this out

From 4-7 players works well for me and I like everything EXCEPT the Leaders expansion, which seems to take the game from fun filler to more and seems to fail IMO, needlessly making it difficult 

I am glad I own it and will play with the right group or use to introduce to newbies -

I don't know why everyone went so crazy about this game. It's a fine, inoffensive game, but it's unspectacular and uninteractive. Yes, it's simultaneous, but your choices have such an indirect effect on your opponents and most other players essentially don't affect you at all.

Love it! Excellent replay-ability given the game design. Can be a little difficult to understand how the bonuses work when you first start, but once you begin to play it becomes clear. Game play is very fast; everyone plays simultaneously so there is no time lost in waiting for people. Ideal for 3-4 players. It can play more, but then the group gets split because you are only influenced by your neighbors in this game.

Pretty fun, but I'm not crazy about it.

I have the same problem with that that I have with Caylus. It feels like the designers tried to cram every idea they got into the game and then beat on it with shovels until it became balanced. It doesn't feel very elegant to me. There is just too much "stuff" that doesn't add much. I have a feeling this could be a great game if it was simplified and tightened up a bit.

played 3 games of this last night.  the game is gorgeous and i loved the 'no downtime' aspect - made for a very speedy, involved game - but i cannot shake the feeling that the game plays me.

there are some tactical choices that are/seem fun, but... it just wasn't overly satisfying.  not enough control over my own fate.

and i generally love 'engine-building' games.  (e.g. Puerto Rico)

it was fun enough and i would not turn down a game, but i don't feel the need to own it.

I really enjoy this game when I play it.  It is a deck building game as cards are passed around the table and you select one card to 'build' your community.  From money to markets, to production, to war, it is a pretty cool game.  Reasonably fast, and easy to learn AFTER playing one game.  I love the scoring and we as a family are always trying to break the top score of 61.  Our 11 year old still holds it, but one of us has finally tied with it.

Really like the feel of the game (building a civilization), yet it has a short playing time.  Scales great from 3 to 7 players since most everything only involves dealing with the player on your right and/or left.

Lots of fun and really easy for first time gamers to pick up and play. Simultaneous action = almost no down time. Even though the mechanics are simple, it still takes about 20 minutes to go through all the rules for a first time player (which is sucky for a 30 minute game). 

Quick, so you can readily play multiple times in one session.

Wow! I really like this game. For all its complexity it is singularly easy to teach and play, and is loaded with all kinds of decisions that can easily be made in a split-second.  Many different strategies to choose from, a lot of interaction with your adjacent players. Not much you can do to affect players on the other side of the board except wasting cards they want in your Wonder. I really like the passing of cards around the board. One of the most important criterion I use to rate a game is the amount of fun I have playing it, and 7 Wonders is simply a lot of FUN!!

I uploaded a huge scan of the scoresheet for full page printing to be laminated for a reusable score sheet.

7 Wonders is a modern classic. Antoine Bauza has designed a game with Card Drafting in such a wonderful way. In the beginning of the game, the battle is for resources. After, players keep fighting for points.
The scientific tree is my favorite way to develop my civilization, but the people who plays with me already know my preferences and keep blocking me, forcing to try new strategies.
Another way to get lots of points is the blue cards. In stage I, they get few points, but in stage III, you can get such as 8 point with a card.
The theme of developing a city with a wonder is well designed. You can get cards to develop your city, your wonder or just to get money.

7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player, as in Fairy Tale or a Magic: the Gathering booster draft. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided as in Bauza's Ghost Stories.) Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.

In essence 7 Wonders is a card development game along the lines of Race for the Galaxy or Dominion. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Unlike Magic or Fairy Tale, however, each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.

Though the box is listed as being for 3-7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.

Really a Gateway game. The quality of competitive gameplay gradually diminishes as more players are added due to a lack of direct interaction with others who are not to your immediate right or left.  You are pigeonholed into your victory condition by the Wonder you receive.  The expansions are poorly implemented as they are dependant on each other and create balance issues.

Card drafting. Draw, pass, repeat, repeat, repeat, score. Meh.

RATING: 6
It's an interesting design, but I don't like it nearly as much as most people seem to. With more than four players it's far too easy to get screwed based on the decisions of your immediate neighbors, who are not affecting other players to the same extent (or at all, with more than five). The decision space is also not as large as it might appear at first, which is not surprising given how few decisions you can actually make in the game.

My 6 rating is a compromise: as a 3-4 player game I might rate it as high as 7, but with 6-7 players I'd rate it no higher than 5.

RATING: 8
Good:
-Perfect for people looking to become hobbyist
-Simultaneous turns
-Truly supports up to 7 people
-Scales amazing (just not with two)
-Components and Art are fantastic
-One page reference guide sums up iconology very well
-Multiple paths to victory
-Will seem familiar to Magic: The Gathering drafters

The Bad:
-Iconology will overwhelm at first
-Confusing rulebook
-Too many small decision for non-gamers
-Scoring is awkward and long
-Purple cards throw off balance

?-Make sure to enforce the no duplicate cards rule.  Ignoring it will make science strategies too strong.   

Overall:
A board game collection should be like a Swiss Army knife.  It should have a game for every situation.  7 Wonders is the perfect game for when you want to play a strategy game with 5+ people and finish in under an hour (trust me, you will be in this situation a lot).  The simultaneous turns nearly eliminated downtime and keep players engaged at all times.  The multiple paths to victory help keep the game fresh and give players direction.

7 Wonders really plays like Fairy Tale combined with Race For The Galaxy like scoring and tech trees. Luck and gambling/guessing play quite a big role in the game, but considering its short playing time and almost non-existent downtime that might well be part of its charm. The game scales incredibly well from 3 to 7(!) players. The explanation of the end of game scoring and card icons is a little daunting, but everything falls into place quickly once you start playing.
UPDATE: Always like to play, even though the game has lost a little of its initial appeal. One of the best 6+ player games in existence.

Two plays thus far, one with three, the other with four. It is basically a card-driven engine/production building game that is not terribly innovative, but has TWO major pros. 1) Short playing time. 2) 7 players. These two factors only bumped this game up by at least 1.5 on my ratings. The simultaneous action selection mechanism will always have its detractors, but I do think that it fits perfectly well with this game. The only folks you need to watch out for are your neighbors to your immediate left and right. There is plenty more interaction than I expected even though the interaction is somewhat benign and predictable.Good game, but not great.

7 Wonders is a draft game, and one I would tell people to avoid at all costs. 

The theme is pasted on, there is no grand civilization feel to the game. The only interaction is with the people sitting next to you and it's minimal at that.

If you're unlucky enough to be sitting downstream to a person who knows what they're doing then you're going to be in for a rough time. You'll lament your position while you watch other people on the opposite side of the table scoring tons of points because they're positioned between people who are less experienced.

Do not believe any argument about having influence on people more than 2 spaces away from you, it's simply not true. You can table talk all you want, but at the end of the day, everyone is at the mercy of the people who are passing to them.

If you're looking for a game that lets you play 7 players, then I'd suggest Resistance. If you're after a draft game, then just play Magic the Gathering. Build a cube (which is just an assortment of cards) and draft that with some friends. 7 Wonders isn't worth your time.

I've been told that this is best with 3, but it's highly unlikely that I'll ever revisit this. It's also important to note that my disdain with this game comes from the group I was playing it with. On my right, I had my mate who's a drafting shark, and on my left, a beginner who couldn't stop complaining as I was drafting "too fast". I thought fast play was a good thing, apparently not according to some people. All the while, people sitting at the opposite side of the table were just handing the win to someone else.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Great game.  The draft mechanic gets really fun upwards of 4 players and at 7 can be so painful it's brilliant. 

A simple, single "win" scenario (VPs), can be achieved in many ways - and ideally a combination.  After many plays I still don't feel the need to purchase the expansion.

Com uma mecânica bem interessante, divertida e desafiadora, além de uma temática linda, inteligente e muito bem sacada, esse jogo te pega logo de cara. Na 1a. ou 2o. jogadas você pode não saber muito o que fazer e se perder um pouco pela quantidade de símbolos diferentes, mas logo se torna intuitivo (outro mérito para a arte).
O mais fantástico é perceber como se pode fazer um jogo completo baseado em uma única ação: escolher cartas!
Pode-se até dizer: oras, mas todo jogo de cartas (principalmente deck buildings) são assim.
Metade do tempo... A segunda grande características dos cards games é tomar ações baseadas nessas cartas escolhidas, aqui não... Basicamente basta escolhê-las na ordem/ momento certo... E isso que o torna fascinante.
Peca um pouco pelos set-up e contagem final de pontos levemente demorados, mas nada que desabone esse family game leve e divertido.

I'll play 7 Wonders, but it is SEVERELY overrated.  It's not great with 7 players and there are countless better games to player with 6 or less.

I am sooooo tired of fanboys saying this game is the "perfect family game."  Family games in the real world are less complicated than this and do not feature such massive amounts of iconography.  It's completely illogical.  

7 Wonders is light strategy, NOT family.  Period.  And if I want to play light strategy I'd have hundreds of other games to choose from.  Why this game gets all the attention is absurd.

When I first played 7 Wonders, I was extremely impressed. It seemed to pack a large amount of game into a 30 minute time frame, while allowing for up to 7 players. However, almost two years later, I have learned many more games, which has led me to discover that 7 Wonders isn't nearly as impressive as I thought. 

One aspect of 7 Wonders that I find to be extremely frustrating is the aspect of interacting only with your neighbors. It is very frustrating when your neighbors have lots of military power, so you have to have 7 swords to avoid losing a VP, while the player across the table can win every battle by only playing 2 swords. The resources are also frustrating, since if one player plays a ton of resource cards, his neighbors can leech off them, but the other players can't. I have seen games where brick cards, for example, never made it over to my side of the table, so I was without brick for the entire game. I also can't stand the guild cards that score VPs for cards played by their neighbors. So I spent half the game playing blue cards, and you can just play a card that gives you 8 VPs from MY cards? Having said all that, if the players play quickly enough, and if the game is played with 3-4 players, I find it to be rather enjoyable.

Just played again last night and moved my rating up a bit. I rarely play anything but the two-player variant, and I didn't realize how much you can exploit the dummy city before. 

It's an interesting solution. 

This was one if the first games we bought, and we played it so much that as we began acquiring more games, this didn't make it to the table as much.

I have lots of games to compare it with now, and it still feels innovative. Love all the paths to victory and the subtleties I keep finding.

Its main pluses-- it plays really fast, but each decision involves some thought (sort of along the same lines as Dominion/Race for the Galaxy in terms of speed, in between them in complexity). I think with more plays/more awareness, I could probably really grasp how other people are affecting my build/strategies which seems like a cool extra idea (the deck is basically preset).

Edit: Played a few more rounds, and there's definitely a "solved" factor that makes this game substantially less fun (moving this more into a Dominion-level). Lower rating just because Dominion at least presents a different initial puzzle, and is more newbie-friendly.

The best game I played at GenCon 2010, and from the hype and the description, I was actually expecting to be lukewarm at best about it.  Very solid drafting mechanics, very quick play, accommodates a larger than average number of players, and asymmetrical starting boards.

A rule of thumb as you look down the list of comments: in virtually every comment that says it is "random" "chaotic" "luck driven" or "low interaction", you should replace those statements with "this person doesn't know how to draft".

A game about drafting, picking a route, and hoping for the best. A lot of nice quirks to the game. Combat element allows aggressive players to attack, but doesn't make passive players feel bad because outside of minus a point, you don't lose anything. A truckload of Icons, which makes up the game, so teaching can be a bit rough at first, also with a few small rules that are easy to forget. I find it a solid quick game for gamers, but actually not very suitable for non-gamers.

Okay filler. Takes too long with 2 (one player must play for themselves and the dummy player each turn), although 2 player has more interaction (taking away cards via the dummy).

This game is like drafting MTG and Settlers together.  It's a very balanced game with a small learning curve.  It shows a lot of promise and replay value (depending on starting wonders and how many players you have).

Base game fills its role well and remains pretty unique as a fast-playing euro for lots of people.

I would usually try to get a smaller group playing something else instead but am always happy to play.

"Choose one card and pass the rest on" sounds way easy enough to teach even non-gamers, but there is a whole bundle of vocabulary you have to absorb about how the cards interact before you know [b]why[/b] to select anything. I'm not willing to invest the time, not really the decision process I seek for my entertainment.

Overall it just plain strikes me as attractive for middle-school age players.  

I put down a 4 rating but my thoughts truly are better matched by the wording that goes with a 3.

I played this every week when it came out, but the setup time, as well as the time it takes to teach new players the game, with a lot of variables to learn, in conjunction with the game being mostly luck in spite of so many decisions that seem important and meaningful being made, led me to tire of it fast. But I still like it and want to play it every few months or so. I'd recommend many other games instead of it that I'd get first, such as Sushi Go!, which is a fast, simple game with almost the same mechanics. But if you do get this game, you want to get the first two expansions and the extra city boards as well. The latest expansion, Babel, I haven't tried yet, but it's very expensive, and it changes the rules and makes things more confusing, so I don't think I'm going to get it.

Found what appears to be a Chinese rip off. Rules are in Chinese, the cards are laminated, and the money tokens are wood. Still this is a fun game, I enjoy drafting, even though I definitely over think it and don't do too well. Simple game once you get the iconography, so the Chinese characters on the cards and tablets are no big deal.

This is a pretty revolutionary game, at least for me. The game definitely takes way longer to explain for the first time then it takes to play. It's a draft game where you take a card from a hand and then pass the rest of the hand to the next person. You try to build up your civilization through different means (trade, military, technology, etc) and the game is over after three rounds of this. There isn't any talking in the game at all which is definitely a strike against it in my eyes, but there is player interaction through drafting and it plays very very quickly. I might be terrible at 7 Wonders, but I'll play it any time it gets taken out. Definitely a must have for most board game collections.

7 Wonders is a fine game, I can't say I really enjoy it, I feel more like I'm going through the motions.  I think it's passable purely on the merits of being so fast and with very little downtime.  It doesn't excite or interest me really, I'm just playing cards and hoping I get certain cards and waiting for the incomprehensible scoring to come.

1st update (Oct 2014)[8]: Great game, really parents-friendly and 7-player friendly, which is great for social gatherings. I really like the multiple paths to victory, and that it's not clear who wins before the end.

Great, fast-paced game. My only complaint is that scoring is a bit messy for my taste, especially considering the speed of the game.

-After a bunch more plays:
I'm marking down the score because while the game is pretty easy to teach it has a nonsense scoring system. At least provide player aids, geez.

I'm also raising the score because I keep wanting to play this! I can't wait to see what other expansions come out! Maybe I'll see one I actually want!

One of the best rafting games on the market.
Like most drafting games knowledge of the pool helps people play better, so outlining the dominant strategies to new players is very important. 

Sidenote: If you are playing in a tournament and the top 2 scores continue on to the next round - don't try to stop the highest scoring player, just get a good score on your own :(

RATING: 5
Probably the most over-hyped game I've played. The game feels so clinical and semi-automatic once you've figured out what strategy you'll pursue. Credit is due for its "30 minute play time with 2-7" design, though.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The game is good, not comparable to 2 hour "deep" games but still a lot of meaningful choices in 20-30 minutes. However, I think this game is best with 3 players, maybe even 4. The more players, the more it's about randomness rather than good choices that would benefit you and interfere with your neighbours. So despite being playable with 7 players I would be hesitant to play with more than 4.

This remains our family's go-to game for game night.  It sets up quickly, plays fast, and scratches the board game itch nicely.   

If I have a complaint it is that with larger numbers of players (6 or 7) it feels like two games being played rather than one because there are literally players that you cannot interact with and with whom no one that you are interacting with can interact with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
On par with most good Euros, but the fact that it can do so with 7 players in 30 min. is what makes the game astounding. This one has earned a permanent place in my game bag for anytime we have more than 5 or want a filler game while waiting for more people to show up.

EDIT: On subsequent plays the game shows that it lacks some replayability, but is great for the first dozen games and still good, but not great thereafter.

I was very skeptical about this game after hearing about it.  There were plenty of red flags, like a too-short playtime, and a dry-sounding production mechanic.  But actually playing it has left me pleased.  Art and art design are gorgeous.  The drafting is very simple, but there's lots of layers of stuff to consider, like what you want, as well as what you can't afford to give to your neighbor, all while retaining a really fast playtime.  This is a really tight design, plays up to seven without significant additional playtime, and has a good amount of strategy to it.  Great choice to start building a game collection.

Вообще впечатление двоякое, вроде и неплохой арт, быстрые партии, но все же много схожестей с предшественниками, города - ресурсы / ресурсы-города.
Так же много действия одновременно, не всегда можно уследить за другими, все ли всем хватает, все ли честно все делают. Тем не менее игра неплохая.

RATING: 8
Great game for 2-4 players, maybe even with 5. The game with 6 or 7 players is really different, and more or less skill-low (probably even skill-less). Still THE current filler for gamers to play with non-gamers.

Still need more plays to understand how much depth the game has with 3-4 players (2p is a different beast). My guess is that it has quite a bit of depth (less than RFTG, of course, but more than Dominion, base game, would be my current opinion).

EDIT: not sure about depth (leaders solves some of it). Still a very nice game, with a lot of appeal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Bland bland bland. I'm basically done with this after 7 plays spread over 6 months. Those 7 plays are virtually indistinguishable from each other, nothing memorable in a single one of them. Choose a card, put it on the table 18 times, add up the scores. Ooh, 42 this time, instead of 48. Wow.

edit: Ended up purchasing this, mostly just to get some use out of the promos I keep ending up with. :) The comment above sounds harsher than it is, the game is ok, it's just not "all that", and shouldn't be anywhere near the top 10 on BGG. Fun to pull out for a large group for a quick filler every few months, I have no idea why folks are playing this dozens and dozens of times in a week, or making it the focal point of a game night by playing it repeatedly.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I am fascinated by the fact that up to 7 can play this in the same amount of time.  There are many paths to victory, and it is hard to know which one is best.  It depends a lot on what your neighbors are doing.  Fortunately, it is short enough that you can always play again.  I enjoy the drafting, even though its a challenge to let go of the other cards I want.  It is a drag not to be able to interact with any of the players other than the two right next to me, though.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Great game to play especially with five players. The cards are extremely poor quality and this point is driven home by how much the game cost. I was really bummed that the 2nd Edition replaced the wood money with cardboard. The purple shading quality on the Phase III cards was also a big concern. All in all a great game to play but the 2nd Edition is a FAIL in my opinion. I will wait for a third edition and if they come down on price I will probably re-purchase it and donate my current copy.

(11/10) - After a handful of plays with anywhere from 3 to 7.  This is a very smooth game.   Card drafting, variable powers, set collection, battles, simultaneous builds.

Decent drafting game that totally lacks interaction (that's why it works with several players: each one just plays with his two neighbours).
It's an enriched filler that still has only the substance of a filler.

Kellemes, gyors játék - ha akarod igen komoly taktikai mélységgel.
Ugyanakkor a leosztásokon is sok múlik, így ha véghezviszed a kigondolt tervedet még közel se biztos, hogy nyersz.
A draft mechanizmus ezzel a játékkal lett szuper-népszerű! Kis hátrány, hogy ketten csak nyögvenyelősen lehet játszani, három játékosnál pedig mindenki-mindenkivel interakció van. Így az igazi mélység 4+ játékosnál jön elő, amikor olyan emberek fejlődését is számba kell venni, akikkel nincs direkt kapcsolat a játékmenetben.

Rated after two three player games. The game feels interesting, but I have no idea how much there is really depth in this game. I need to play more to find out and this feels like a game I like to play more.

Rated after five three player games. The game feels good once you (and others) know the rules and mechanics. Needs to be tested with more players. Updated after two 6 player games with couple of newbies. Game was naturally slower and did not felt so tight, but in the end the games were quite even.

Game is incredibly fast once you have played it couple of times. The mechanics are good and the theme is nicely fitted into the game. The latest game was a seven player game were all of the others were practically newbies. The game was fast and most of them liked it. With large amount of players, it is quite difficult to track what others are doing.

This is our favourite strategic family game. Its best feature is simultaneous play: everybody is making decisions at the same time.

Game plays quite fast. Once you know the rules and mechanism it may take around 25 min. for a game to be played. The game urges you to make difficult choices as you have limited amount of turns. Teaching the game (even to people for whom this might be their first ever board game) takes around 15 - 20 minutes. 

This one strikes the excellent balance between simplicity, diversity and tactical thinking. You have to plan out your moves from the very beginning to win in the very end.

Love it and I would truly suggest this as one of the first games to play with family and friends. Plays really fun with more than 4 people althouhg 3 player game has its knack :)

Achieves what it sets out to do- provide a meaningful gaming experience for a small-large size group in under an hour. You are constantly confronted with difficult choices, but while you are competing with everyone at the table, you are really only playing with the people on either side of you.

Purchased for when our group had 7 regular players. After a couple of plays no one took to it so it was sold. A good design, just not a great design for my group so away it went.

Contrary to popular opinion here on BGG, I think 7 Wonders is only okay.  

The card drafting is fun.  But 7 Wonders isn't the only game that does it.  The rest of the game is pretty dull.  It's not as deep as other civ games; but all the iconography doesn't make it newbie friendly either.  

Its younger sibling, 7 Wonders Duels, is a much tighter and incredibly more enjoyable gaming experience.  It has sort of "fired" this game for me.

Now this was the first game that took to the next level of euro board gaming after being introduced to Catan.

This rating is for the vanilla game only.

Not nearly as good w/o expansions. Need to pick these up. This gains maybe 1 point per expansion (Only tried cities and leaders) making this an 8 w/ both. Vanilla just doesn't do it for me though.

** PERMANENT PLACE IN COLLECTION

Plays fine with two.

UPDATE: After four plays, scoring upped to 8. This is a good game that benefits from repeat plays. It's solid, even with 2 and a dummy player. Really nice, fun and replayable.

RATING: 9
the theme is very good, the word 7 wonders is general but always interesting. the goal to create the most influencing wonder is good, and so is the variable power among each wonder. the number 7 is really applied to this game, and it suits the theme very well

the gameplay is actually simple, it's a deck building game variant through card drafting mechanic. the transformation of each age is also cool, the rising strength of card is really good. the fact there's several aspect in the game is good because it makes the game balanced, and the fact that you cant excel in everything offers so many strategy. player interaction is good, countermeasure to opponent's strategy is ok, you need to counter people's strategy, but not too much that you should lose focus of yourself

the components are good. card design is good, artwork is really nice, the tokens are nice. the card size is a bit too big though, it makes the table feels cramped sometimes

overall, this game is very good. this game has a very nice concept translated into a nice gameplay, but really, 7 variables are somewhat too many. it's not really suitable for casual gamer, the mechanics are a bit complex. the card drafting mechanic suits this game well, and i'm always a fan of card drafting. i rate it 9/10

The true game that all drafting mechanic games leads up to. It only looks like one of those overly complicated games that takes an hour alone just to teach. In reality, it's simple to learn and provides tons of replay value since there are so many ways to get to victory. Great for family, friends, and regular boardgamers.

Great filler title, also works great for introducing non-gamers to the hobby.

Éditeur, nb joueurs : 2 à 7 joueurs.
Éditeur, durée : 0h30/partie.
Éditeur, âge : 10 ans et plus.

►PUBLIC(S) QUE JE RECOMMANDE:
☺ Jeu de stratégie mixte (quelques éléments aléatoires et/ou de hasard raisonné).
☻ Personnellement, j'hésite à le considérer comme un gateway-game, à cause de sa multitude d'icônes qui peuvent rebuter les nouveaux joueurs.

►JOUEURS, NOMBRE(S) QUE JE RECOMMANDE:
# Meilleur :
# Recommandé : 3, 4, 5
# Non-recommandé : 
# Non-essayé : 2, 6, 7
2 joueurs : je n’ai pas d’intérêt pour les configurations requérant un joueur virtuel.

►COMMENTAIRE(S) ABRÉGÉ(S):
± THÈME : plutôt plaqué; mais agrémente le jeu.
+ Aide de jeu : 1 inclus mais j’aurais aimé qu’il y en ait 1 par joueur (photocopies?). Bien détaillé.
+ Configurations équilibrées selon le nombre de joueurs.
+ Configurations multiples : plateaux individuels personnalisés.
- Déroulement répétitif : peut donner l’impression que toutes les parties se ressemblent.
- Icônes : requièrent un effort d’apprentissage et de mémorisation.

►REMARQUE(S) PERSONNELLE(S):
Jeu qui a l’avantage de demeurer fluide, quel que soit son nombre de joueurs, grâce à sa mécanique de draft où les tours de jeu s'effectuent en simultané. De plus, il présente d'autres mécaniques intéressantes tel que : le principe de "chaînage" permettant de construire un bâtiment gratuitement (si on a construit précédemment un bâtiment inférieur lié), les ressources perpétuelles (qui se renouvellent au début de chaque tour) et la guerre (symbolisée par le pouvoir de dissuasion des puissances militaires en présence).

En ce qui concerne la configuration selon le nombre de joueurs, il faut retirer des cartes spécifiques, en les cherchant une à une, dans les 3 paquets (âge 1-2-3) et donc, pour chaque configuration de joueurs, la constitution des paquets est quasiment toujours la même sauf pour quelques cartes « Guilde » qui elles doivent être ajoutées aléatoirement au paquet 3e âge. À noter que c’est l’un des aspects que j’apprécie des extensions Leaders et Cities, soit l’apport de cartes aléatoires qui atténuent le côté "figé" des paquets 1 et 2 du jeu de base).

Personnellement, c’est un jeu que j’hésite parfois à sortir lorsque je me sens trop sans-coeur pour :
1e- effectuer les manipulations préparatoires.
2e- expliquer la multitude d’icônes (ce qui fait que j’ai de plus en plus tendance à y jouer seulement lorsque tous les joueurs connaissent le jeu).

►EXTENSION(S) ESSAYÉE(S):
& « Leaders » : Oui.
& « Cities » : Oui.
& « Wonderpack » : À essayer.
& Je n'ai jamais essayé l'(les) autre(s) extension(s) parce qu’elle(s) n’a(ont) pas assez soulevé mon intérêt pour me convaincre de le faire.

I don't see the appeal... but I've only played it once and had no idea what was going on. I need to give it another shot or two.

RATING: 8
So, the buzz is telling you that this is an approachable, straightforward game with a variety of strategies, all of which appear to be fairly balanced, and which plays in about 30-45 minutes, regardless of the number of players in the game.  And ... well, it's true.  I mean, I can come in here and talk about all of these things again, but why bother?  If you haven't bought into the buzz by now, not much that I can tell you is going to make a difference.

It's also true that this game won't be everyone's cup of tea.  It's entirely possible to wind up with a totally crap hand, where your best option is to discard a card for 3 coins/1 point, and it hardly seems efficient to play that sort of game.  It also seems to be highly dependent on the luck of the draw, but playing with fewer players might help alleviate some of that, since you can manage the hands a bit more carefully.  It's also true that you have to lock in to a particular strategy early in the game, but the varieties of strategies you can try, and the ways that the game can be different every time you play it, adds a lot to the appeal.  Someone once wrote of Fluch der Mumie, "If this sounds like the thing you might like, then you will," and I can say the same about 7 Wonders.  I can say with certainty that I'm glad I own it, and I expect to play it many more times.

I'm starting to like this game more with fewer player numbers, since it means you have some sense of planning with the cards, since you'll see more cards from your hands going around the table.  With more players, you're strictly at the mercy of what's passed to you, and it turns the game into a tactical one.  With fewer players, the game takes on a bit more of a strategic edge.

The words 7 Wonders is really applied to the theme. Its a game about develop a civilization of one nation through variable power among each wonder. The goal is to make most victory points (VP) either via science, civilian, military, or economic way.

The gameplay is simple, it's a set collection game variant through card drafting mechanic that last in 3 Ages. I rate it 9...

RATING: 8
Maybe 8 is not enough for this game. Excellent card game, with a lot of opportunities for your strategy planning but little interaction between the players (at least not visible). The fact that until the last round you suspect but you don't know who the winner will be, makes you sit on the edge of your sit and enjoy the game until the last minute. For me, it is a disadvantage that the play lasts for so little time (less than 30' for experienced players) but maybe that is one of the magic elements of the game. Rather expensive for what it contains, but which game with so many awards is cheap? A must-try game!

My family really struggled with this one.  The rules were difficult for some reason and the iconography got in the way of understanding.  I had heard this was a great and really easy game to play but we didn't find it to be that.  Maybe we just needed someone who had played before to teach us but, I, generally find it pretty easy to learn and teach games so I was surprised at how difficult this was.  It really flopped for us.

RATING: 7
A solid classic. Half an hour to play, so new players can fit enough games into an evening to learn and improve significantly.

Each turn players choose and play a card from the hand in front of them, then pass the remaining cards along for the next person. There is no hidden information beyond what cards are in the hands which have not come past you yet.

There are multiple paths to victory, appropriately through 7 sources of victory points. It's not a sandbox though- there isn't the dizzying choice of strategy of other games. It's a medium-weight game.

Up to 7 players, but that's a bit much really- 3-5 is better.

7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player, as in Fairy Tale or a Magic: the Gathering booster draft. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided as in Bauza's Ghost Stories.) Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.
\13\\13\
In essence 7 Wonders is a card development game along the lines of Race for the Galaxy or Dominion. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Unlike Magic or Fairy Tale, however, each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.

RATING: 6
7 Wonders is certainly a well-designed game, but I think it's a tad overrated. I'm not sure if that feeling is just a let down from exposure to the hype machine that trumpeted its release or if it's simply because I have played (and enjoyed) Fairy Tale so much. While the details of play are certainly different between the two games, both still boil down to drafting cards and then playing them in front of you in an effort to collect point scoring sets. Fairy Tale has much better interaction however, with cards that can nullify or alter cards in the opponent’s tableau. 

It might be that 7 Wonders has such an engaging theme that many players don’t take notice of its simplicity. That's not necessarily a knock against it; indeed I think it's the one aspect that is perfectly executed. Since this game is designed to seat seven players, that simplicity is more or less a requirement. It’s not too often that a party game can pull off something this ambitious, so I suppose it does deserve some merit for doing that so successfully.

To reiterate, 7 Wonders is a very good design...I just want something a little more meaty in my civilization games, which is why I think in some ways it misses the mark for me. I do like it. I just don't think it's anywhere near as good as other card games in the top 100 like Race for the Galaxy, Innovation or Dominion. I suppose I expected more out of it, because I simply don’t think there is enough meat to the game to justify a top 20 BGG ranking.

RATING: 7
My favorite way to play Magic was booster drafts, and this didn't disappoint...much. The drafting part was great fun, there's enough interaction to keep you on your toes, and I like that the ways to score points are so diverse. However, I didn't like how difficult it was to keep track of the other side of the table, and I'm not certain that there's enough there to prevent the strategy from cracking after enough plays (or if the metagame would prevent any one path from becoming too apparent). I should note for the record that, as of this writing, I've played three 6-player games using 3 different strategies 
(military/wonder board, blue cards, and science) and I came in a close second all 3 times, so this isn't just whining about "X is totally overpowered"; it just seems like the type of game that runs the risk of getting stale for me, like Thurn and Taxis did. Then again, some of it may just be that I let the hype get me overexcited, because it is a very good game.

Update: leaving the earlier comment to note progression, but I enjoy this game a little bit less every time I play it. I dumped my copy but some friends still have it. The big issue is that I don't think it actually works that well with more than 4 players, and there are so many better games with 4 that it doesn't seem worth playing.

It wasn't love at first sight with this one... but I had so many recommendations that I had to get it.
First playthrough was so-so (I won)... second one (luckily right afterwards...) I thought I nailed the mechanisms already... and then I lost. This is the best thing that can happen to me in a non-luck based game. It means it is more complex than I anticipated and that I have been sloppy. A challenge!!!1! ;)
After a few more games now I can say I love this game - there's so much depth to it... so many different paths to go down and so many ways to thwart them. 

I might even upgrade the score to 10 if this continues like it is currently going. I even started to buy the extensions without a closer look at them - just in case I can get my fellow players to branch out and try something new.

A quick multi-player game where you interact with your neighbors and play cards to max out your victory points. There are many paths to victory.

This is a relatively light game that is quick (due to simultaneous action) yet complex enough for newbies. I'd say this is a must-have gateway game.

Revisiting this has me upping the rating. Just so much in so little time, a fun theme, and with one or more expansions, sufficiently variable.

Expansion remarks
-----------------
Leaders: creates more asymmetry, mixes up game state, allows some forward planning, but has too many icons to remember.

Cities: adds card variability, limited nastiness, but some fuss in setup/takedown.

Babel: changes basic evaluations, increases interaction/dependencies, can increase nastiness, but again adds icon-lookups before play.

All are expensive relative to content. Babel or Cities adds the most for the least rule intrusions if variability is desired. Leaders is more strategic (an odd choice for the first expansion).

With all of gaming intelligence and combo building, which is my favorite, 7 Wonders is still somehow not in my top list.

This has been our 'go to' game for years. Haven't introduced any one (who's any kind of gamer) to it who wasn't impressed. Straight forward card drafting with a variety of home boards to randomize your base developmental powers (wonders). Lot's of variety depending on the number of players at the table. You generally need at least 3 (better yet 4) to make a real game of it. For 2 I would suggest 7 wonders 'dual'

RATING: 9
Really great card drafting game, focused on set collection, trading off short and long-term benefits, and guessing what your neighbors will do. Hits a complexity sweet spot for me--there's enough going on that it's interesting over many plays, but easy enough to play with mixed groups of experienced and newer gamers. Scales excellently from 3-7 players with minimal increase in playing time.

One thing to note is that you only directly interact with your immediate neighbors. This keeps things the complexity very manageable (good) but also means you can essentially ignore what everyone else at the table is doing (bad). It also means that who you sit next to will be very significant! Two military-minded folks sitting next to each other will waste a lot of resources for less gain than if they sit on opposite sides of the table. This definitely leads to some metagaming, which may or may not be your thing.

This is a good game, but I do not believe worthy of the hype others have given it.  The best thing about the game is that it will accomodate up to 7 players and it plays quickly.  

I have a hard time calling any game that lacks a coherent strategy a civilization game.  There are synergies you can put together, you can pursue different paths, but it is impossible to put a coherent strategy together due to the constant passing of cards.

It used to be one of my top rated games, but when I revisited it after a long break it lost a bit of its shine (I guess I've spent too much time playing Race for the Galaxy...). It's too simple for my current taste in games. Still, simultaneous play in 7 Wonders is it's selling point - being able to finish the whole 7-player game in 40 minutes is just wonderful. And the whole package looks fantastic.

Bought it primarily for the art and the theme, I really wanted to like it. The more I play it the less I like it.
I have played it at least 10 times that weren't recorded.

What I Like-
Plays quick at all numbers. Actually plays longer with 2 players due to dummy player management. I like the civ idea. I like the art. I like the trade with your neighbors only aspect. 

What I Dislike-
It's just 'pick a card' and pay for it. Very samey feel each and every turn. Strategy limited to denying neighbors a card they want vs scoring points yourself. Would like to try it with all cards laid out and have players able to compete somehow to get the card they want. No crescendo or build up. Flat.

7 Wonders hits just the right length and depth for me as a "civ-builder". There are enough choices to make for some challenging decisions and yet the game manages to stay supremely simple and quick-to-play thanks to simultaneous player turns.

The "take one, pass it on" hand-management mechanic is interesting, forcing you not only to think for yourself but also about what you might be passing on to your opponents.

The game seems to scale well for all group sizes and I was even pleasantly surprised by the 2-player variant. My wife (a non-gamer) has requested 2-player games of 7 Wonders because she found it such fun. I only wish the game featured slightly more direct player-interaction but that is only a personal preference and I understand the "Cities" expansion does this.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
I have played this a tremendous amount of times and (while it is just now starting to get old) I can see the universal appeal of it.

Drafting games are among my favorites and this packs the feel of a Civ-lite into the game as well. There is some light player interaction, it scales beautifully and with experienced players it lasts around 30 minutes no matter the number of players.

Replay value is the only issue I see with 7 Wonders, however, it still stays fresh for more than enough plays to warrant picking this one up.

RATING: 2
Light and fast card game, which feels somewhat pleasant - despite being very poorly designed. I found a comment made by "newuser" which sums up very well the issues with game:

Fallacies about 7 Wonders:
(1) "The game scales well." It does scale well from 3 to 4 players. Anything more and players see too few cards, don't get the chance to pick more than a single card from most hands, and don't have any meaningful way to affect non-neighbors.
(2) "Easy to learn. Good gateway game." Beyond the many symbols and icons, players must understand and be familiar with the cards in each deck before being able to reasonably judge value of cards. This requires players to sit down and study the deck or play dozens of games with blind trial-and-error. Too complex for non-gamers, not enough meat for serious gamers.
(3) "Deep strategy. Many meaningful decisions." Even under the best case assumption of 4 or fewer players, tactics are more important than true strategy. Most decisions are reactionary, based on relative point values of each card. With more than 4 players, strategy is right out the window.
(4) "Player interaction." Nearly multi-player solitaire. You aren't able to draft cards without playing them yourself, so card denial is very limtied. Can't affect cards once played. Only interaction is through passing coins to neighbors.
(5) "Well balanced." Except the player boards aren't well balanced, with some providing easier paths to victory than others.
(6) -- this one statement was about theme but I don't agree that theme is bad. pictures look pretty well and follow the meaning of cards. scoring system is acceptable.

A classic enjoying a permanent place in the collection due to its player-count flexibility.  There aren't many games out there that are easy to teach, equally good at different player counts, and that can play 7.  It feels as though I'm making several crucial and meaningful decisions throughout, although at times the hand plays itself.  Sadly, I seem to be really bad at it!

Feels too abstract. Theme and mechanics have nothing to do with each other and I don't feel like I'm building an empire much less a wonder, I'm just moving cards around. The endgame is anticlimactic and counting the scores is tedious and boring. I'd count the fast pace and the number of possible players as positive sides. I wont object to playing this but I'd rather play something else every time.

The best qualities of this game are that it can handle such a wide range of player numbers and it plays relatively quickly no matter how many players there are (provided it's not a learning game).

I enjoy the civ building and drafting aspects quite a lot. The ways to get VPs are unique enough, but they aren't sufficiently well balanced and often one's score depends too much on the cards they get late in the final round which are hard to anticipate or influence with previous decisions. Too many cards are just worth a certain amount of VP without any interesting interaction with the rest of the tableau. This makes the game simple and quick (which is a feature, not a bug), but sets a pretty low ceiling for strategy.

Eh, it becomes repetitive after awhile.  I find this is sort of the anti-gateway game.  It seems like it should be a great game to introduce to new gamers, but then their eyes glaze over at the different symbols, different types of cards, different uses for each card.

For experienced players, it's fun for about 10 or so plays, but then becomes samey as the luster wears off.

It's a good game, but not great.

*Update 11/11/12* Down to 5.5.  It's to the point where I would probably turn down a game of 7W more readily than be up for one.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is my favorite board game.  Period. It perfectly combines the 4 things I look for in a game. 1: There are multiple ways to score points.  You won't win this game the way you won the last game.  And you may find yourself switching strategies 2/3 of the way through the game.  2: There are lots of ways to mess with your opponents.  Often, the choice of what move to make is whether to do something that helps you or do something that hurts your competition.  3: It's not over until it's over.  You never feel the last-place blues.  The person who swears they're losing can turn out to have won when all the points are counted.  The on-a-roll player can wind up in 3rd or 4th.  Everyone has fun the whole game.  4: There's relatively little luck.  Too much luck can actually hurt you in this game (play it and you'll see what I mean).

And while many of the other favorite games also have these 4 aspects, 7 Wonders ties up my 10/10 vote for two reasons.  First, games are short.  You can finish a game in 30-40 minutes and you are left wanting to play again right after.  Second, every player takes their turn at the same time.  There's no waiting for everyone to go before it's your turn again.  It moves fast, everyone plays all the time, and and just awesome.  Get this game.  Do it.  Right now.

Empire building card game.  Erect an architectural wonder.  Card draft game which I really enjoy--the agony of passing great cards to your neighbor.  Has a military scoring path and neighboring players can pay each other for resources.  I keep thinking I can pass on this for something new and fresh but it keeps calling me.

Dry but very effective and simple Euro game; the drafting mechanic works well as do the multiple VP-paths design. Wish I could play this more often!
Recently got in to this 2p and Rahdo is right: it's excellent - more control, more strategy, less guessing and luck (though still quite a bit).

Have had a few plays now and this game keeps getting better.  I could skip the 2 player variant but 3, 4, and 5 players is a blast and the competing for resources gets to be a lot of fun.  The passing your hand mechanic adds a nice twist because I found myself playing cards or using them to build my wonders just so someone farther down couldn't get them.

Works: (1.4) this is definitely a two because of all the accolades.  The .4 is because of the two player game part.  The wife and I will play 7 wonders only if other people want to play it but we do not play it by ourselves anymore.
 
Inquiry: (1.4) there a multiple paths to victory with different affects in the game.  You can get combinations of cards to multiple victory points or take victory points away with a card or two.  Or you can get a combination of cards to earn victory points or other cards with victory points on them.  The .4 is because there is a path to win that is strong and can dominate if other players are not aware.

Collaboration: (1.5) there is some interactions with people because of how you trade cards in your hand.  What I mean is every one has the opportunity to see what other player have in their hands. The .5 is because there are moments in the game where I feel I am playing against no one and trying to problem solve my best move.

Organized: (2.0) the space in the box is well organized and can sort all of the different cards.  Also there is room for grubber apple sauce plastic containers to fit inside to hold all of the other small cardboard components.
 
Reading: (2.0) The rules are well laid out with lots of pictures of the cards and components.

Longstanding card-drafting game that allows you to build a civilization through three ages. The economic engine that each player builds can be very satisfying, and there are ways to change strategies midstream. Still too little interaction with other players for me, but an enjoyable game.

RATING: 8.38
Card-drafting game in which you attempt to build up infrastructure and economy to build your wonder and score points.   The gameplay is fairly simple to explain although it does rely heavily on symbols to represent what each card does, which is usually intuitive but there are a few that require the use of a reference sheet.   It takes a lot of players without slowing down because turns are simultaneous.  However, your main player interactions (trade and war) are only with the people sat to your right and left, which may make you feel like you’re not in the same game as the other players.

I like the drafting, and I like that it's short and plays with 7, but that means I essentially have no real control since I can only impact my neighbours. I prefer drafting when it's leading to something (i.e. serves another gameloop), rather than being the gameloop in itself. Personally, I would rather play the game in a lighter packaging like Sushi Go.

A grail of sorts: many designers have tried “civ lite” -- i.e. captures the feel of Civilization/4X games but takes significantly less time to play -- to varied success, and this is the best I’ve played.  It’s truly a compact and easy-to-learn design. There are divergent paths to victory, lots of resource management, some player interaction, and enough ancient world theme to hold it together.  That said, this game boils down to set collection.  It’s generally better to take a large number of one card type than a variety.  It’s very possible to have seven players end the game with fairly similar tableaus separated only by color of card.  Many decisions that feel extremely significant only vary by one point.  In the third Age, it’s very possible to have two or three plays per “pack” which are worth the same value.  I like the “counter-draft” aspect of the game, but I think it’s not as important as it seems at first.

It doesnt play very well with two, it gets a bit confusing during the third age. Unfortunately I havent tried it yet with more players, and even though I see its potential, its theme is not accessible to casual players. I really want to give it one more try though!

Ook ik ben gegrepen door de hype van 7 wonders. Makkelijk en snel te spelen, maar toch is iedere kaart weer een belangrijke beslissing. Klein nadeel is dat je enigzins afhankelijk bent van je buren.

The concept of having a 7 player game take maybe barely longer than a lesser player game is fantastic.  The card drafting mechanism of everyone taking a card and passing the rest to the left and right is brilliant.  More games should use that concept.  You don't have to wait for every individual person to make a move, and you effect the people to your left and right a lot throughout the relatively short but strategically packed game.

Game gets better with the leaders expansion and the cities expansion. The Babel expansion should only be brought out with experienced players.

13/5/14 upped the rating to 8.5 from 7.8. No other game can be as engaging and yet scale so well. Bravo to Bauza. Can't wait for Babel. 

3/12/13Quite a good card drafting game, but at times a bit chaotic and random. Strategies are limited to either civics or research, despite the sheer number of Wonders. Needs expansions to keep it interesting.

Played with 6, was even more entertaining. More cards in the mix enabled some very closely-fought battles.

Definitely recommend the iOS app for randomizing and bookkeeping. Also stores stats and win info

I bought this game to play with casual gamers because I read that it is a light game. Unfortunately casual players didn't warm up to the game, and I didn't find the game engaging after four plays so I sold the game. I think there is a barrier for casual play as familiarity with the cards is required before long term strategy can be employed.

RATING: 8
Took awhile for me to get this to the table, but it became an instant hit.  Very open-ended gameplay which makes it easy to change both your strategy and tactics.  

Love that you not only have to concentrate on the civilization that you're building, but it is an absolute necessity to watch the opponents to your left and right.  If you don't, you are playing blind.  

Easy to get into, even if you or others are new to the game.  After a few turns, game-flow becomes intuitive.  The one element of gameplay that isn't immediately intuitive is the scoring mechanism.

This is mitigated by a large, colorful summary sheet.  It shows the scoring mechanisms as well as each card that triggers scoring.  Easy to follow.  This same scoring summary is also printed in full color on the back of the game instructions.

Great gateway game.  Fun and fast card game.  If you are someone who enjoys civilization building games, definitely scratches that itch.  Replay value is high, especially now that there is an expansion (sold separately) to add to the variety and strategies employed in the base game.

Good times are waiting for any one who decides to play 7 Wonders.  :)

The basic mechanic is basically like drafting Magic cards. Recommend 3+ players (two player mode is bullshit).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Note: rating is for base game only.

I think this is a good game, but not really a great game. It's possible I might change my rating if I end up playing it more than 20 times. 

I believe a lot of the acclaim for this game has to do with it being playable by large groups without tons of setup, and without a huge time investment, while still having some considerable depth. I respect that as a major design achievement. But I think in the future it will be completely outdone, many times over (I hope). I just don't find anything particularly exciting or elegant here - it's a pretty good drafting game (but only a drafting game).   

It's also noteworthy that I think it's not as good with 6-7 people as others mention. Even with a really good group, a 6-7 player game can be a lot slower, and it's really difficult to keep track of the entire game state. That said, I think it's underrated as a 3-player game as well. 

The area where I find the game to ultimately be limited is in the amount of information you can glean by looking at cards. Some cards have VPs listed on them. Most don't. Why not? The military and science cards totally have space for text, but new players have to constantly be reminded of what things are worth what VPs. That's just a minor example, but I think that the rules could generally be integrated into game play a bit better. Sure, maybe after 10-15 plays I'd remember every card, etc., but it just could be smoother.

An amazing game.  It's a filler game as far as play time (30 mins), but the numerous scoring methods provide multiple strategies, and this game will probably always be played several times in succession, so it ends up being much more than a filler.  There is no downtime, no matter how many players, and it is super-versatile, playing just as good with 7 as it does with 4 players.  There is interaction, but it's mainly limited to your immediate neighbors, so you don't have to strain looking across the table, and you can easily keep an eye on either side of you to block what you think they need.  It's a fun game to play because there's a fair amount of strategy without becoming work, and there's no boring downtime waiting for others to take their turns.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
To its credit, 7 Wonders is an extremely light Eurogame that plays in one hour or less, regardless of the number of players.  That's impressive.

But each player's ultimate success is fairly random, since both wealth and victory points are dependent chaotically on what your immediate neighbors choose to do.  As proof, I crushed everyone on my first play of the game (7-players), and that's simply unacceptable given that I had no idea what I was doing.

So yes, new players can do well.  But when newcomers can do [i]that[/i] well, there's something not quite right.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A good game that's fun and more-ish with plenty of decisions to be made in its half an hour playing time. However, you can reach saturation point with it where each game begins to feel samey. 

It's similar to a Magic: the Gathering draft only without having to play the game afterwards. This is clever because the best bit about Limited Magic was card drafting and deck building. What made those drafts great was pack evaluation, signalling possibilities, great variability and the thrill of opening packs. How does 7 Wonders compare on these points?

Pack evaluation: Working out which is the best card in the hand you've been passed, given what you've drafted already and what is likely to come your way. Sometimes what would be the best card in a vacuum is not the best choice given your previous picks. I'm glad this is still present in 7 Wonders, although there aren't so many things to factor in compared to Magic. This is likely to become more important as players get increasingly familiar with the game. The first few games will involve some relatively uninformed picks, but I can see a learning curve here to work through.

Signalling: Much more obvious in 7 Wonders, as players can see what you've picked after every pick. 'Hate drafting' is possible by spending cards your opponents want to build your wonder or to turn into coins.

Variability: Except for the purple scoring cards, the same cards are used in each game, so there's never going to be a game where one particular colour is present in greater numbers than another, or one resource is rarer. Expansions may change this. Without them, some variability comes from the different wonders each player can play and the interactions with different neighbouring wonders. There aren't as many different cards as I'd expected.

Thrill of opening packs: With every pack you open in Magic, there's always the hope that you'll get a ridiculously powerful card (usually rare) that fits right in with the rest of your deck. This is a complete lottery, but it's still exciting. In 7 Wonders, the only thing that matches this is hoping your 3rd Age hand contains a purple card which scores for cards you've already played. Not quite as thrilling, but also less swingy, so probably fairer all round.

It's easy to pick up with a depth that belies its simplicity and has the advantage of accommodating up to 7 people with little increase in time.

Simple game.  Plays quickly.  There are usually at least a couple decisions to make if not interesting ones.

You must have already played to know how to play.  I think there's a design flaw if not a documentation flaw there somewhere.

after more plays :
fun, but not very deep.  many things about the implementation seem really clunky.  Geeks are overrating this for some reason.  also, game is way overpriced for what you get.

Dropping to 5 which is more than fair.  Seasons has proven that drafting and card interactivity can be done better.

7 Wonders was the first drafting game I've ever played and it has a home in my collection. This is a good game with a a distinct end after 3 rounds and is a good game to learn as you play. Often leading to wanting to play a second game.

This game is very enjoyable. The card drafting mechanic is always fun to explain to people that have never played a CCG. The game is played very quickly and it very simple to explain. I do not like the 2 player variant, but the game seems to scale well with 3 and up. 

Cards seem to wear quickly, I ordered some sleeves to counter that...

Juego de civilizaciones en el que se usa el sistema de "draft". Este sistema consiste en que todos los jugadores ven una serie de cartas, escogen una y pasan el resto al jugador de su lado y así sucesivamente. Nuestra civilización se va desarrollando mediante cartas en los aspectos militar, económico, científico, cultural, etc. Para ser un juego de civilizaciones es bastante sencillo de jugar, lo cual no suele ser habitual para este tipo de juegos.

After reading the rules, watching demos and playing my first game (expert though, with a virtual third player) it looks like a promising game. At first it strikes with complexity, though it looks like it will get simpler with time (like with RFTG). Lots of different ways to win, interesting calculations of victory points (most interesting part of the game:D). Also it is very short, so you can play multiple matches at one session and there is chance to win at least once or to try different strategies. So far rating it 8 and placing among RFTG and Dominion. Maybe will rate it higher after more plays.

Fun drafting game not a gateway in my opinion due to the iconography not being intuitive at all, making copies of the player aid was useful.

Games are quick and I enjoy that, decent diversity of scoring options although I do feel some (cough science) can seem a little too easy/advantageous in the base game.

I used to play this game at work with a bunch of people. It has gone down in popularity since most people are playing Magic now. I still like this game and would play it again if I could get a few other people to play.

The play count is unofficial. I never kept track of our play count, so it's just an estimate.

We had a boardgame weekend already planned and I bought this on a whim from the store next to my workplace and brought it without consulting my friends prior due to the buzz about the game. All of us are very big Magic players, I draft about once a week and my other two friends basically grind drafts on Magic online for supplementary income. We all liked it so much that just this buying it on a whim just insured two more sales for Asmodee, assuming my friends can find a copy by now.

The premier lite, fast "gamer" game.  Thirty minutes for up to 7 people.  But it's not casual.  And gamers want something with more meat.  So, I think I'm gonna have to let it go.  GORGEOUS player boards, cheap cards.

RATING: 8
Despite the ancient civilization theme, 7 Wonders is mostly abstract. The card drafting mechanism adds light interaction, but players can still do well if they just focus on their developments and essentially ignore what everyone else is doing. Having said that, being handed good cards (ones that fit well with your strategy) can hand you the victory. It is, perhaps, a bit too breezy.

A fun strategy game, works well for beginners and variable size groups. I appreciate the simultaneous play (even if it can be confusing to explain).  Sorting out the cards for different numbers of players is a pain.

RATING: 8
Game is somewhat easy to teach (1 playthough oftens seems enough for people to get the game), although how technology is scored takes a game or two for new people to get used to (especially the impact of gathering technology). Plays quickly, keeps everyone involved almost constantly and can introduce non-gamers to what else is out there in the boardgaming world.

I like the theme as I'm attracted to this historical era, so that's a small plus for me as well. I like how they used bigger-than-usual cards, but that makes it harder to find sleeves for the cards if that is you thing.
The box insert is pretty and usefull, but the actual space you would need to store this game can be drastically reduced by not keeping it in it's original box.

Great game. Has played well with 3-5 so far. Lots of card interactions and the drafting process is fairly unique. Science seems a little over the top, but players might have to actively take those cards to prevent one player monopolizing it.

Slight rant: a drawback (for me at least) is that the cards are [i]not[/i] finished and therefore will start to wear somewhat quickly. Sleeves are an absolute must. I don't understand how game companies can make an entire game composed of cards and decide not to finish them...

Based on one play.

Gameplay is fast and elegant. Lots of things to do and it doesn't take very long to do any of them. This is a huge plus. Scoring is a big pain, but this is among the lesser problems. 

I'm not really a fan of the Guild victory conditions - sort of wish they were more varied in their scoring potential instead of +1VP per [ ] in neighboring/your civilization.

The 2p variant is a bit underwhelming, but I thought it worked well at 4p+.  It's mildly annoying trying to tuck the cards under the corner of the player board, but this game would take up way too much table space if you don't -- it already takes up more than I would have expected. Frequently advertised as a gateway game, but I've had issues getting new players to understand the game.

Have to play it more to really give a final verdict, but so far it's fun. Not have a very good idea of all the combo's and cards yet, but i will soon find out and re-rate this.

The game could be way more streamlined though. The manual is a mess too. Its basicly a card collecting game with a few categories, but learning or teaching the game they made overly complicated. I tried teaching the other group who weren't all gamers and it basicly came down to not playimg the game because people lost the fun of it.

A game which seems to achieve that rare thing - scalability and minimum downtime. hang on... that's TWO things! Have had several plays and really enjoyed every one. All the people I have played the game WITH feel the same. It will be interesting to see, when the newness wares off, whether killer strategies will emerge which will limit re-playability. Not sure where it sits with regard to randomness versus strategy. But it's fun so does this matter?

Great game...if they could have increased the length a bit then it would get a 10.  I feel it goes too fast and hard to really build up certain trees, but overall very accessible and fun.  Love the ability to have lots of people play this one, but it does suffer from a solitare effect.   Overall...fun fun fun game which is a great gateway for those who have only played Catan. Arguably the best "Filler" game on the market.

RATING: 7
The shear amount of options of cards/abilities/strategies of this game can be confusing to new players, but those who have played it, have really enjoyed it. The fact that it plays up to 7 without a substantial increase in time is also great.

While there is quite a bit of variability in the based game as player count, wonder, cards available to draft, all change from game to game, I can see how it could feel "samey" over time. Luckily there are many expansions available should I ever get to that point.

As it currently stands, it's a fast, fun game to play.

Demoed and bought at Gen Con. So much organized chaos, it is great. The game keeps a real good tempo that not many games can achieve. I don't like that only the neighbors to your left and right matter (makes me think this is best with three players) but that is my only gripe. I like the variety of options you can draft to get points. I do think technology gets you the most points, but usually, everyone figures that out and no one monopolizes it. Think Sushi Go + Civ and it goes up to seven players!!

7 Wonders' main strength is its innovative game mechanic, whereby all players consider their options at the same time. That shortens game time significantly. The fabulous artwork adds to the feel of the game. Best part is its two-player variant, which does not feel flat and overly random but instead provides much intrigue.

Recommended for gamers who are looking for shorter game time board games to act as fillers.

This is a quick game, but it was dragged down because we tried this with non-gamers and it did not work.

While I disagree with the idea that 7 Wonders is a gateway game--there are FAR too many symbols, despite the simple card drafting mechanics--it is one of the most versatile games around. I have really enjoyed this game with 2, 3, 5, and 6. Looking forward to trying the other player counts.

RATING: N/A
Very good mechanism and great game. However there's something about this game I don't like - maybe it's because I haven't played it in groups bigger than 3 people yet. A group of 5 or more players will definitely make the game more fun I believe, because you'll never see the cards in front of you again and you're forced to pick one!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
The Amazing artwork hooked me in before the hype really got going... and some nice reviews from geeks I trust dragged me the rest of the way... and I'm glad they did :D  This heavy filler has just enough decision points and angst over what cards to play and pass to keep it interesting.  While it doesn't feel much like civ building... it does feel like building something (or failing to do so in a bad game...) This will be a great game to wind up or wind down game nights for a long time to come.

Also, the 2 player variant is just great.  It adds a few more decisions to be made and more opportunities to deny your opponent cards.  It is a bit slower to play with 2... but if you want a bit more in the game its the best way to play!

For maybe two years I tried to play, but my desire didn't materialize. Finally, I bought it because It was cheap and I moved to another country leaving many games at home. So I had to start a new gaming group, and I took the chance to buy the game. 
We played 4 and all first-timers; me, the only gamer, explained the rules. Some people got them very easy others didn't. So this was a - point, but I didn't expend more than 15 minutes doing it (+ point). The most difficult part to grasp for them was building the wonders' levels. 
We played the first age one by one, and it helped to clarify the rules, and soon after it was smooth. Everybody was engaged, looking at each other's tableau and think thoroughly. It took a while to finish, but it didn't feel like that. 
I don't like brainy games although I love board games because the tension they give and the difficult trade-offs. 7wonders gave me this, and I could play it with non-gamers, and it seems everybody enjoys it and it doesn't feel overwhelming.  What I miss were the laughs, the table talk and jokes, I guess is a matter of the group.​

Deserves its status as a modern classic and I enjoy it at high player counts. But I acquired this to see if it would supplant its little brother (which I'm not a huge fan of) at 2 players and have to acknowledge that it doesn't work as well.

RATING: 10
Amped up Fairy Tale.  Some cards are worth points, others give you resources so you can draft and play better cards later in the game.  Each player gets a different Wonder, with its own abilities and point systems.

Light and quick but definitely deep enough to be satisfying.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It's good! Enjoyable, interesting, has just enough interaction but can be quite solitaire if desired, which is a nice break from my usual sorts of games. Plus it plays almost any player count. It's not got endless levels of dynamic card play and strategy, the game is quite simple but there are multiple paths to victory, intriguing decisions to make where the optimal move is not always obvious and you can mess with other players a bit without being too cruel. I like it a lot.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Nice drafting game with next-door-neighbor interaction to make it quite playable with 7 players.  Impressively, the 2-player drafting works really well, too, due to the clever mechanisms provided to create a schizophrenic third player (played alternately by each player... from the real player's slightly-enhanced hand!).

As I play this more, I think my rating my be at risk of rising from [b][bgcolor=#99ffff] 7 [/bgcolor][/b] to [b][bgcolor=#66ff99] 8 [/bgcolor][/b]....

Despite being called a gateway game, the rules for 7 Wonders can be a lot for new players, particularly the different ways each kind of card scores. However, the many ways to score offer a lot of variety even with just the base game. This is a keeper and will probably be counted as a classic given a few more years.

You can play this with 2-7 players and get a gaming fix. Nothing really draws me to playing it apart from that it's convenient in terms of time and players it can accomadate (ie 'What shall we play, there's X of us?', 'I know...'). It's a bit like pulling the lever on a one-armed bandit - its over pretty quick and I'm eargerly anticipating the scoring. It fits the bill and you get those gaming decisions you crave but I can't give this game a better rating.

Can't mention this and RftG in the same breath. RftG has incomparable art and is much more cerebral. Different games entirely.

The drafting mechanic makes for fun and quick gameplay. There are a lot of elements to this game, so scoring takes a while (but luckily there's a handy scorepad that breaks it all down for you).

Also, I can't seem to ever win this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.9
I can still play this game for two reasons: it's fast and pretty. As a game though I find it uninspiring. The length and the mechanic do not allow much room for changing/adapting strategy during the game, so you're basically taking chances as you can't forsee when and if you're going to see certain cards.
Also there is really not much in the way of interacting/interfering with other people, and to me the game totally lacks tension.

Update: with more plays and the Cities expansion I'm starting to like this game more. Still not my favorite nor the example of excellence most are claiming, but a nice and pleasant game to have handy for many occasions (and the short playing time helps).

Only played it once, and should play it more to get to know the game.

The pace is very fast, and for a first timer, you will probably not know what strategy to go with.

I played the game with 4, and we didn't really talk during the game. (only when I had questions about the rules :)) This is a downside for me, seen that I want board games to have a social aspect in it.

For now a 5, and it will probably raise when I'll play it a couple of sessions, and know what strategy to play with.

RATING: 4
After 10+ Plays: I wasn't too impressed after my first play of this, but I kept getting pulled into it because it is so popular with my group, and now I like it even less.  The drafting only provides the illusion of different strategies, when in reality you do the same thing every game.  If I'm collecting green cards in one game, how is that functionally any different than collecting blue cards or red cards, which give points but in a slightly different way?  Add to this tedium the fact that among competent players, the outcome is nearly all luck.  Whoever draws or gets passed a few fortuitous cards in the last round will dominate.  

In large part this game has the same fatal flaw as Fairy Tale--drafting is not a game by itself.  There needs to be something that the draft is leading to, which creates actual interesting decisions during the draft.  Otherwise, you're just left picking the highest point cards.

Hmm . . . I'm still unsure of what I think of 7 Wonders. On one hand, the drafting mechanic certainly is intriguing, and I am impressed by the balance between the different scoring strategies. On the other hand, I am not convinced that it would not get old after the cards are more recognizable. Even in my second play I was less enamored than I was originally.

I believe my opinions are affected by playing it with fewer players (4 and 3). One or two games of 5+ players should provide a more complete picture. I do find myself wanting to play again, even if only to clarify my opinion of the game.

RATING: 5
Typical Euro. Good mechanics and no theme whatsoever. There is absolutely no flavour of antiquity except for the words on the cards. The strategic choices are really confusing and it will probably take some time to get the proper strategies. Personally I felt this was a complete waste of time to play, though I accept that other gamers may admire the mechanics.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Medium weight, pretty simple to teach. Fun with pretty good replay value since the different wonders and different drafting affects what strategy you'll use. Far more tactical than strategic, since the cards you draft and what your opponents choose can prevent you from planning what you want to do in advance. I really like that the simultaneous action selection prevents the game from slowing down with more players.

Tried to use it as a gateway game. Ended up being too complicated because of all the different card types. Also the other players expected something more interesting to happen after the drafting than just calculating final score.

Plays quick, is relatively easy to explain, the girlfriend loves it and you can play with 7 in 30 minutes. The game certainly is great for casual play, as filler or as warmup. New players need one or two games to fully grasp it's concepts (how draft works, how to find a balance of resources, how to chain your buildings). Experienced players can enjoy the layers of strategy that reveal themselves after several plays, while there is still the chance that a casual player can compete for the win.

Really good game. Some say this game is overrated but I couldn't disagree more. The beauty of this game is the player range it supports without loosing its playability.

I also like that as the player number goes down the strategy goes up making for an appropriately luck based game with a large group and an equally appropriately strategy based game with a small one.

This is one of my favorite games. It's not very strategic, since you don't know what cards you'll have next turn, but instead it provides you with an incredibly rewarding tactical game experience where you constantly have to adapt to what's on the table and what's in your hand. Best with 4+ players in my opinion, the 2 and 3 player experiences are still good.

My favorite part is that it is asymetrical, with each player having access to different powers and resources based on their wonder. Each wonder provides a satisfyingly different experience.

An excellent filler card game with simple mechanics and a fast pace to it. Very convenient in that it plays a crowd (in about 40 minutes, no matter how many play) and stands well to repeat performances.

The game is tricky to explain and I could see it at times not hitting the table because I can't muster the energy to teach it. "Race for the Galaxy" suffers from the same thing, to a greater degree.

Also worth mentioning: The game has stunning artwork, but the cards aren't very good quality and will start to show wear rather quickly.

Own all of the expansions.

Interesting and very quick, although I've overplayed it at this point. You might get stuck without the resources you need with 6 or 7 players, and getting a neighbour to pay you constantly for resources isn't always something under your control. But has many different things to do, the drafting mechanic is fun, the variation in the wonders is neat, and it's hard to get completely screwed (although earlier decision can come back to haunt you).

This game is great. And it is horrible.
The nature of drafting is ok, but the implementation in this game makes it horrible at times. You can be in a situation where you litterally have no way of winning due to the drafting, where no matter how good of a tactitian you are you are still screwed - hence the rating.
When it is good, the game is actually really enjoyable. But when it is bad you wan't to flip the table and play another game instead.

This game has been such a success at my gaming table.  I put off buying it for a long time, because I was concerned it would be too light.  However, my family and I played it for free at a local pub/game store, and we fell in love with it.  

Yes, it is rather light on rules, but every turn of the game introduced meaningful decisions.  Which card is the best for me versus which card should I deny my opponents (and, if so, how can I capitalize on that denial)? 

I usually prefer long games that are heavier in rules, but I just can't pass up the delight that we all have with this game.  Additionally, every time I play, I try to pursue a different strategy, and I'm impressed by how many different avenues are available for victory.

El juego tiene 3 eras. En cada era se irán rotando 7 cartas que los jugadores pueden construir para obtener recursos, PV o habilidades especiales. Tu puntuación dependerá de las 2 ciudades que sean tus vecinas ya que puedes comprarles recursos y te enfrentarás a ellas con poder militar al final de cada era.

A játékosok minden körben egyszerre cselekszenek így mindig nagyon gyors játék (illetve annyira amennyire a leglassabb játékos :) ) Úgy éreztem néha nagyon random, hogy ki fog nyerni.

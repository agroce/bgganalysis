I played a lot of chess one year. Somehow got to 1900 ELO on chess.com 
Wasn't good at it but for every move i'd sit literally for hours thinking about every decision before committing to one (i often played correspondence chess, where you had a lot of time to make a move).

I absolutely love the mind-games aspect of it. But i don't like abstract games, nor heavy memorization and dry pattern recognition.
On the other hand, on a casual level those aren't required.

Chess has staying staying power no doubt. It is well rounded and deep. 
Just not what i'm looking for fun-wise.

Chess is the #1 board game of all time. Multiple cultures from all over the globe have been playing it in some variation and studying it for centuries. There are multitudes of professionals who dedicate their entire lives to mastering it and it has crossed the threshold into being a sport and not just a game, and in my opinion it's more exciting to watch than many sports.

The problem with a rating system that takes account of every one of thousands (?) of ratings is that everything ends up between 5.2 and 7.6.  Really, Chess:6.963 out of 10.  By pure coincidence that's were Earth was rated by 1,000,000 alien nations.  I can understand if you say you'd prefer to play Advanced Squad Leader or Awful Green Things From Outer Space but show you have a sense of perspective people! Chess is a truly awesome battle of intellects, think Fisher vs Spaskey - when did another board game ever capture the imagination of the planet in such a way?  If you rate chess at 6.9 or less you mustn't be any good at it!

Chess is a classic, but you have to religiously study it to be great at it.  I prefer games where someone with zero (or relatively little) experience can jump in, figure out the dynamics, and outstrategize their opponents.  With chess, you have to memorize all kinds of openings, strategies, and such to be really great.  I prefer Chess 960 (the Bobby Fischer variant) to straight-up Chess.

RATING: 9.5
Good, straight, solid, strategy.  Especially fun with a chess clock.  I don't play it often though, because it just isn't fun if both players aren't at relatively the same skill level.  I'll play this when I'm in the mood for an intellectual exercise; but when I want relaxed fun, I'll play something else. That said, the game is very much a classic that is very traditional and a part of our culture, and I think it is a very good game to know how to play well. With a chess clock and a short time limit for each player (i.e. Speed Chess), the game is INTENSE and way fun!

Really, this is the ultimate game and the game with which I started. It may not have as much theme as other games (unless you can imagine it as a battle... which I do), but it has other advantages - most significantly, you can go anywhere in the western-world and there will be somebody to play and grow against. Seriously, I've more than once felt that all the time I've put into euro-games and the like would have been better put into this. It certainly would have been a lot cheaper.

An enduring classic, and deservedly so (though overanalyzed), but it just doesn't grab me. It feels a bit limited and seems to reward memorization of certain gamestates to an extreme degree. It is easy to teach and makes a good "gateway" game, but for my gaming time there are fresher, more interesting, and more fun games out there (for the time investment, at least). There are almost certainly better abstracts in terms of strategic depth and balance, but cultural inertia makes it unlikely that any game to come will be played by a larger group of people. For me at least, it's better as an intellectual exercise than as a game.

I'm not a Chess fanatic.  I enjoy the game, I know how the pieces move and the general tactics and strategy in the game.  I do not know the names for the beginning sequences or anything like that.

In fact, I really dislike that aspect of chess - that's it's so well known and has been played so much that you're just acting out a script, until someone deviates from it.  You're playing out the same games other people have, over and over again.

I'd rather play Go or Navia Dratp, but Chess enjoys widespread popularity and I still enjoy playing ... against people who regard it as a game!

I always liked Chess very much and previously used to play from time to time. Now I rarely play I am a weak player.

Also since I learned Go I like Chess less. Chess seem to be simpler and shallower than Go while having more rules (mainly due to more kind of figures).

But still I like this game very much.

RATING: 9
Easily my most played game.  Most of those plays were online blitz long before I discovered modern games.  

I always wanted to be good at chess, but the need to study/memorize openings always felt like work.  I also often didn't enjoy games without time limits as I always preferred to move quickly rather than analyze every move to death.  For these reasons, and despite playing it a ton, I never progressed beyond an intermediate level.

Now that I have played so many modern games, I'm much less enthusiastic about chess.  A game played quickly and aggressively between two evenly matched players is still a great experience though.

Staying true to my other ratings, I cannot honestly have Chess rated as a "four". It is a solid abstract even at today's standards. There is nothing broken about it.

The game has a rather steep learning curve for an abstract. First, all pieces follow unique rules of movement. Once you have the basics mastered, you have to memorise several openings to avoid check-mate in first few rounds. Next you have to train yourself to concentrate so that you can easily plan several moves ahead. To master Chess you have to play a lot which is something very few are willing to do.

I certainly understand why many people do not enjoy playing Chess. It takes so much computing power to go through all possible permutations and in the end you still end up doing something silly and get kicked into face for it. But at least compared to Go, Chess is easier to analyse. Usually, key plays change the balance on the board immediately so that it is easier to see what went wrong and learn from your mistakes. And the fact that Chess does not shine in casual / occasional playing will keep people away.

You might say that this should be a 10, and I can see many, many arguments for that.  The fact is though, that very few people master this to any great degree or other.  Nevertheless, I enjoy it. It is very pure and I have a beautiful Greek set of bronze pieces.

I don't think Chess is a bad game, I just have no desire to play it.  I need some semblance of theme in my games.  Games between amateurs are uninteresting to me, and I don't want to invest the time to learn the game's intricacies.

RATING: 6
I am a rather unorthodox Chess player. My strategies tend to be random at best. Usually I am looking so far ahead into other players strategies that I miss obvious moves.  And while I can hold my own if I have to, it is not my favorite game to play. Granted, in eighth grade I did organize a Chess group in my math class, but that was more to get out of math than it was because I was passionate about Chess. 

The one person I have never played against is my husband - he was a master Chess player back in high school - playing those five-minute crazy timed Chess matches and winning every time. I respect him too much to submit him to my insane tactics. (Why is it everyone forgets that the king can attack? Sure, it probably won't win you the game, but it's not like he's a totally worthless piece!)

However, that said, I do have the most beautiful fantasy Chess set. In truth, I have it more because the figures are just awesome than because I regularly play.

Using the BGG rating system seems weird in some senses and my rating for chess is a good example. I think that chess is a 10 game in the sense that it is a great mixture of strategy and tactics, has the ability to be played multiple times without "solving" it, and makes you analyze both the game board and the opponent to play well. But I'd rather not play it all that often.

It's a good game.  I suck at it, though.  Some people see 10-15 moves ahead.  Some see an entire game ahead.  I see about 10 games back.
I only like to play it when I play somebody who does not know any strategies, but knows the rules.  It is more fun that way.

Chess gets no respect on the geek. The body of analysis, culture and lore around chess have lifted it to extraordinary heights.  I know that the same can be said of Go and Bridge, and some other games, but all that attention wasn't lavished for no reason.  The only problem with the game is that it induces madness, obsession, psychotic competitiveness and sadism in so many.  Still the most satisfying game I've ever played, though not always the most fun.

Now that this game has been cemented as one of my few 10s, I'm adding some high-modality commentary!

As a solo game, or a 'science', Chess is unparallelled. Your goals can be diverse, but are always achievable. No matter your level, you can always be better. Unlike other games, the horizon can be grasped. If you are 2700+ then you're playing for a living, anyway, so it's not a game anymore for you!

A lot has been said about how you must know this opening, or that, and while I would dispute the notion that knowing a game well is a hindrance to its play, at the same time, the 'sport' in Chess comes from identifying positions that you think will make your opponent psychologically uncomfortable. For instance, I play 1. d4 exculsively, so a King's side player who prefers sharp, tactical play is at an advantage if she can bend the position to those preferences. This struggle might only be apparent to experienced players, but most games require a level of experience to appreciate. 

I adore several variants of Chess. While I prefer 5-10 minute games in real life, I also love Bughouse Chess - the game that provided me with some of the most joyous experiences as a teenager discovering gaming during high school. I find the 'art' of Chess accessible under time pressure, where moves find themselves and profundity happens!

Comparisons with GO and other lifestyle abstracts: I appreciate the GO is more 'intuitive' but I have been heartened to see my instincts confirmed by the recent news computers beat GO players now, as they do Chess players. Technophobia aside, I prefer Chess because of the aesthetic - the different functions of the pieces provide different themes to games, whereas GO relies strongly on the player to create the narrative. With the wealth of culture behind these two games, I don't think any other game rivals. In the end, my preferences lie with a fascination for Soviet and European history and culture over Asian culture, even if overall both intrigue me.

RATING: 6.5
Not a fair rating.
The only way I enjoy chess is via Random Office Chess (ROC). To wit, set up a chess board in your office, with a marker to indicate whether it's white's or black's move. Make a move for white. Walk away. Come back later and make another move.
Actually playing one on one? I'd rather do something else.

Never was any good at it, was considered an OK game. It was the only game that I played with my Dad.

Was the most acceptable game of its time, mainly because there was not much option.

There must be great strategy within that 8X8, but was not in it for that.

Used it as a time with Dad.

What can be said about this game that hasn't already been said?? A Classic? Sure, of course. Pure abstract strategy? Absolutely. But to me, chess almost always ends up with one or the other player beating their head against a wall. Because it's been around for so long and so much has been written about the game, it just comes down to who has done their homework in many cases. The player with the most experience will almost always win. It's a good game but it's very situational. The game requires quite a bit of effort to get good at and once you can say you are 'good', no one wants to play with you! You have to have players who are closely matched in skill level to make it interesting. Without some sort of matching the game becomes pointless for both players.

I have played this since I was about 4, although I didn't start playing it properly until I was more like 9 or 10 (I used to play that you could actually capture the king). I played it a lot when I was younger, but now do so much less often. Essentially it has become a "filler," and I rather feel bad about that. I admit that my rating is based in part on nostalgia and respect rather than on the austere criteria set forth by BGG! (Actually it's a compromise between the 10 I think I ought to give it and the lower rating that would reflect how often I actually want to play it in comparison with newer games.) I don't consider myself very good at chess--I find that I make the same kinds of mistakes over and over, and on the whole I find the experience of playing Euros more satisfying. But I feel like a traitor in saying that, and chess will always have an appeal for me, if only because of its classic status.

My rating is based on the fact that I think Chess is an ok game, but too complex for what it is - and the fact that you have to devote your life to learning set pieces and moves to have a chance against someone who is good.

I much prefer a modern abstract game where it's being able to think through a situation that counts.

I don't like Chess. I'm not calling it 'bad' (3), but I am placing it as a below average gaming experience for me. I think that chess tricks you into believing it's a fun tactical game with variable piece powers, when it's really an in depth game of analysis and prediction of a very limited set of options. Not really fun at all for me at that level.

I prefer to play chiness chess than chess. This is an unforgiving game, and the king have too much freedom that is hard to kill at the end game phase. Also, too many pawns which make opening moves to be pawns only. Too limited on this. Plus the game can take some time to build up, thus get a bit boring. This couple with the free move of the king make the game too long for my taste.

OK, so I can see that it's a good game.  I'm just not interested in becoming, or even being good at it myself.

I've always enjoyed chess, but as a game I feel like it devolves once one side has been largely taken out and suddenly you have to figure out how to pin the King down. Maybe if you have memorized end game moves, you will know how to make this a smooth and quick process. But I've always found it very difficult to achieve, and very easy to continue evading a capture, dragging the game out artificially (with, sometimes, a surprise turnaround). Ultimately, it's a bit tedious.

(This sort of tedious, extended game of trying to pin down ferrets is also the impression I get from my few tries at Go, and possibly why I wasn't particularly attracted to it. At least Chess has a part which isn't that!)

From a greater standpoint, I feel like the game was always intended to be a great simulation of war, and allow people to develop their brains to think in terms of how things work on the battlefield. Which, then, you play the game and it's like...yeah...probably not.

I mean, granted, I'm not a soldier, a general, nor military strategist, so perhaps I'm wrong. But the game fails to capture such issues as terrain, spies, training, and supply networks. Most ancient battles, purportedly, were not set-piece confrontations in an open field, they were sieges to take over centers of power or commerce. Tafl games probably are based on this siege-centric reality to war and so may be a better game if war simulation is the goal.

But more importantly, chess always seems to come down to running through a wide variety of iterations of possible options, to develop an optimal path. A real battle, I sense, is probably more like playing paper-rock-scissors, where you have to guess whether the other guy is going to go left or right, so that you zig or zag appropriately.

Neuroshima Hex is probably (again - not being an expert - but in my opinion) a much better simulation of a battle than chess is. You would have commanders moving people around into different positions, eyeing the other teams troops, to try and spot a moment of advantage and then call in the attack. Once that begins, it will mostly unfold on its own and you're just stuck with the results, hoping that you read everything correctly. Except, of course, in a real battle you would be operating in a fog of war. And chess doesn't even have that.

So...chess is a decent game. But I like to rate things to at least some extent based on what I think the designer was actually trying to achieve. In this case, I feel like it was a bit of a failure, which just happened to be fun despite the fact.

Chess is a classic, for sure, but I am not really a fan. 

While there is definitely a massive amount of strategy to learn with chess (what is it that they say about it having more moves than stars in the galaxy? - or something like that) I find that I can't enjoy a game of chess when I am playing with a far more advanced player.

He or she can easily outwit me and has the skill to think several moves ahead. I know I should study more chess books and practice more but I prefer games that have a good balance between skill/strategy and luck as that way even new players are in with a chance at winning.

I played Chess casually through high-school and college for fun.  I certainly enjoyed a good game, and won my fair share.  I don't really get excited about Chess these days, particularly since learning about Go, Settlers of Catan, and Tigris & Euphrates.

I think the biggest problem w/ Chess is the lack of effective handicapping in comparison to Go.  That results in most games being very one-sided unless the opponents are equally skilled.

The first game I really took to. It's probably inferior to Go on the grand scale of things but it's about taste. If I had the same knowledge of Go as I do of Chess I'd probably like Go more. The clash of minds in this game, the zero luck, the sacrifices, the combinations, the defence and attack and most of all though the possibility of a checkmate. An instant kill which nothing in Go can compare makes this game for me.

starting player advantage and unforgiving of mixed skill levels.  other than that, what's to really fault?  i don't like that element either, but lots of games reward rote memorization and i think superior fundamentals can still fade the need.  timeless game which promotes all kinds of good thought processes.  it can be handmade or bought cheaply and played just about anywhere with just about anyone, over and over and over.  i like www.instantchess.com for quick web-based games.

Classic game of position and war.  Openings are important but have little appeal.  At mid-point, game soars.  End game is often decided before actually finished which sometimes makes it feel too long.  Speed variants offer a completely different style of game and strategy.  A requirement for all gamers to know how to play, but not to master.  [GTI Code: APSD]

I was seven when I first played this against my father, and even with him handicapping himself by playing without a queen or other pieces I never managed to beat him.

Slow and un-fun brainburner, while I don't mind thinking and strategy a round of chess still feels like an hour-long chore. I've never been a fan of party games but this one goes too far the other way, leaving absolutly zero room for table talk while you're supposed to brood over your secret strategies in total, dead-serious silence.

Other issues are the game's unforgiving nature (an early mistake leaves little room for recovery) and how it promotes excessive turtling, the lack of luck factor (hence nothing to blame when you loose), and how it already has been analyzed to death. It just leaves no opening for devising your own optimal strategies (an essential part of any game) when the opponent already has read up on dozens of superior ones.

Positive aspects includes easy-to-obtain components and that most people knows the basic rules, just don't expect them to know the finer details like en-passants and castling (the latter which I did wrong for several years without anyone noticing). 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Obviously a historically great game. Doesn't speak to me because

1) I am not a huge fan of abstracts,
2) its popularity means that a great deal of study and practice is required to be "good" at the game, and
3) computers are now better than the best humans at it.

Many plays a long time ago.

The classic strategy game.  There are those who know chess and those who don't ever want to.

A battle of wits in it's purest form.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5.5
Classic. Probably the biggest problem with this game is that the results of centuries of study into the best tactics have been unevenly distributed over the playerbase. Someone with more knowledge and mental vocabulary (e.g. standard openings, pinning pieces, forking, etc) will almost always win from someone without, and it's hard for a new player to pick up this knowledge just from playing.

I'm not sure where I learned chess. I remember being introduced to it as a kid, trying to appreciate the game in college, and losing to a friend's young daughter in my mid-20s. In all those years, I probably never played more than a dozen games. But then, I started to play some online games out of boredom. After loosing and loosing and loosing... I got to the point where I found opponents of my skill level. And then I won. 

That win motivated me to play more. And while I lost as much as I won... I started to understand the game. Sure, I understood the rules... but I never had an appreciation of the synergy between pieces or the language of the game. 

Today, Chess is my most played game by far. While I don't log my plays... there hardly is a day that I don't play a game of chess or do some tactical problems. It truly is a wonderful game that has been play tested over centuries.

I'm probably an average occasionnal player, but I like playing the game. My main hurdle, is teaching the game without trying to win: It's hard to explain what I'm planning a few moves ahead or what I'm thinking on each move without giving my strategy away. Like most 2 player abstract games it's confrontational and many people have been burned by this game... and that's yet another hurdle when teaching it.

Ezen kívül életem során még sok száz, sőt inkább több ezer partit játszottam. A régiek közül csak azt tudtam bekönyvelni, aminek a játszmalapja megvan. A szabályokat már 5 évesen tudtam, de csak 13 évesen kezdett érdekelni, akkor kezdtem el könyvekből tanulgatni (Apu egy ideig versenyszerűen sakkozott), és eljártam tanulgatni hivatásosok közé. Az utóbbi időben már inkább csak a neten (a felsoroltakon kívül kb. 3-400 parti), de régente versenyeken, és nyaranta Nagyapámmal is rengeteget játszottam.

Egy barátom mondta egy társasjáték után (Warcraft) reklamáló társának: "Ha olyan játékot akarsz, amiben nincs szerepe a szerencsének, menj el sakkozni:)". És milyen igaz. A sakk tisztán taktikai, stratégiai és logikai képességeket igényel. És legtöbbször a jobb nyer. Egyik kedvenc játékom. Bármikor bárkivel szívesen leülök sakkozni. Megunhatatlan.

Chess is a terrific game with a horrific flaw.  It is at its best among two equally skilled players and gets progressively worse as the difference in skill levels increases as there is zero luck to mix things up.

I enjoy that there is a narrative to every game if you know what to look for.

One of the best aspects of chess is that is so widely played and analyzed that if you choose to study it and look for material on it, you will find that there is an over abundance of materials ranging from books to videos and everything in between.

Chess definitely has the depth to be played and replayed over a lifetime.

I used to love chess. I was in chess club in HS,etc. Then, realized that certain players just merely memorize moves like a robot. Played someone and they trashed me because I did "predictable" moves. Second game, I nearly won because I had no strategy, just  moved randomly while protecting each piece. That's "bad" chess. 5.

Update: I am playing regularly at lunch and moved from a "5" to a "7.5." The above criticism can still be true, but I am moving with a "randomized purpose" in my openings and it has helped break the mold.

Chess is wonderful with friends.  Unfortunately it lacks a sensible handicapping system.  As a result, a game between two mismatched players will not likely be fun for both or even either.  This is why Go has replaced Chess as my abstract game of choice.  Additionally, there comes a point in one's mastery of Chess after which it seems the best chance of improvement is to memorize hundreds of openings and their responses.

Outstanding game!  Speed chess is addicting if playing with opponent's of the same skill level.  However, I no longer seek out chess opponents.  Currently I'm more interested in playing a variety of multi-player games, so I guess I am no longer addicted to Chess.   

I could literally play speed chess, Bughouse, or a variant form of chess (or Shogi) for hours at a time.  However, I am not interested in seeking out chess players.  However, I would love to play speed chess with gamers in my present circle of Euro/Wargamers.

The main downside to Chess and/or Bughouse is that I need the time pressure in order to have an awesome experience.

Played a lot when I was younger.  Dad and I had a running game set up on the coffee table that we would play over of number of days/weeks.  Taught me some great problem solving skills and strategic thinking.  Nowadays would rather not invest a whole lot of time in an abstract strategy game.  Will play with my sons to help them the same way my dad helped me.  [Multiple sets, including The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe theme that my folks found in England for me, and the Simpson set that my boys like to play with.]

It takes a special kind of brain to appreciate Chess. The kind of brain that tirelessly records and remembers endless arrays of moves and their projected results. Chinese chess alleviates this problem a bit by playing faster and giving players more room to try out tactics. In my opinion GO lends itself much better for casual play between differently-skilled players and can be much more fun as a boardgame instead of as a study.

The game mechanics are sleek and refined after centuries of polish. Luck plays no part in this game at all.

[i]Chess[/i] is the perfect example of "what you get out of it is what you put into it."  I simply don't have the free time to spend learning "the openings" as I somehow feel obligated to spend. The last thing that I need from a game is guilt.

On the plus side, there will always be an avid [i]Chess[/i] following, and if you know where to look, you can always find a game.

[i]Updated: 8/1/05, Rated: 6[/i]

I'm dispensing with the guilt.  If this game were a true "9," then I would want to play it at every opportunity.  That simply is not the case.  I like to play [i]Chess,[/i] but there are many other games that I would reach for first.

Dynamic pieces with unique movements make chess more interesting to me than other abstracts. The possibility for 'brilliancies' (or in my case, somewhat uncommon/unexpected but nice moves) make the game incredibly wonderful -- in many ways, art-like. Chess has fairly simple rules, yet incredible depth, and is enjoyable at many levels  -- a testament to its greatness. I enjoy chess most with other casual players (where memorization and over-analysis aren't big problems), but it's still hard to find opponents.  Thankfully this is one game I can have a great time playing alone (vs. the computer). A classic for all time, and rightly so. (2009-03)

Timeless classic but requires players of comparable ability, it's only, but often, fatal flaw.

If marketed now it wouldn't have a hope in hell of reaching its status, but does that matter? Prefer to play players who are slightly better. Playing online is a great way to set up cheap accommodation for the global traveller ;-) Memories of one match in Kinlochleven will cheer me up for the rest of my life...

Ironically it was Knightmare Chess that rekindled my love for the basic game (and at the same time injected a welcome dose of light-hearted fun and complex but wacky strategies into something that is often taken a wee bit too seriously). I happily sit down with just about anyone for a match of Knightmare Chess, but the ideal chess partner is proving much harder to find.

I used to be in a chess club when I was in school.  Back then I thought it was a great game (and I didn't know at all about any others except for things like Checkers, Life, Scrabble, etc).

Nowadays I think chess is okay in its own right, but I much much prefer some chaos with my chess, usually in the form of Knightmare Chess cards, and sometimes in the form of quick chess variants (Bughouse and Extinction to name a few).  I think I played chess out of my system when I was younger and in a chess club.

That said, I got a folding wooden chess board with small wooden chess pieces that's roomy enough to fit in both Knightmare chess decks.

Haba apparently has a very cute, tiny chess pocket chess set made out of wood.  It is probably a patch over the little plastic sets you can get here, but you couldn't take it in a plane/car.  Still, it looks very cute.

For me, chess and go are the classic abstract games.  A few years ago, I had an opportunity to participate in my first tournament (at age 37) and lost to many high school and junior school students.  A humbling, wonderful learning experience.  Since then, I have looked at my games and thought about the game much more systematically.  With that mindset, I find that the game becomes really rich and interesting.

2017 - 7 - I recently resolved to be better at this game, and while I've not really put much effort into doing so, I have started doing the chess puzzles on Lichess typically 10 or so a week.  I'm noticing that I am starting to see things that I might have missed before just with this limited exposure and consequently am more open to the game than I was previously.

2003 - 6 - I don&#039;t dislike this game, I&#039;m just not as good as I once was and I have never been as good as I would like.  The pleasure to time ratio is low to me.

Not bad, but I'm never "Yay, chess!"

Chess has one of my pet peeves of a game, and that's "when you start winning, you have the advantage".  You take down their bishop, now they have one less thing to defeat you with.  

So, I spend a lot of my time in this game defending myself looking for that perfect mistake-free move.  This is the game I find myself playing on my phone, a lot.

I think it's almost time to teach my oldest daughter how to play.  She has been asking me for a while.

Don't get me wrong, I like some chess variants very much.  But the global nature of chess is one of its many strengths.  Also, its simplicity, as I rated chess in Game Play Weight, after teaching hundreds of elementary school-aged kids to play, and yet the depth is deeper than anyone I've ever personally known could delve.  I only rated it a 9 not a 10 because I do like to play a few other games more than I do chess, but I can always play chess.

One of the all time classic games.

The vast majority of my Chess playing is done on the website [url=www.RedHotPawn.Com]Red Hot Pawn[/url]. The site is PBEM and therefore games can take a long time (I've played games that have lasted months).

I'm not a particularly strong player, but I can hold my own in most situations.

Best game of pure skill of all time. The fact that it is not in the top 100 is ridiculous. I'm of the firm belief that most of the negative critique of this comes from people discouraged with the fact that they suck at it. Yes, if you suck you will get your ass handed to you by a superior player. Every single time. That can be frustrating, but that is sort of the point of a pure skill game. Some of the discrepancies in skill-level can be mitigated by playing speed chess with the better player getting less time on the clock, if you're so inclined (I am).

The low rating is directy due to the fact that I do not have the drive to learn the deep side of this game, learning specific openings, counter moves, etc. There are many who see this game as the deepest, most pure game ever. For me, it is just an abstract that I am not good enough at.

The best abstract game ever.  I think the biggest challenge with chess is finding another person at your same level to play against.  In chess, the better player always wins (or sometimes ties if they play black).

Chess is a rewarding abstract/strategy game.  The more you learn and play the more you will enjoy it.

The best simple two-player game. The strategy is extremely complicated, and building your fort is pretty satisfying.

That said, at a casual level it often comes down to who has memorized the best openings, or who makes the least stupid mistakes, rather than who has the better master plan. Allowing take-backs can help, but it's still a problem. The better player also wins most of the time, but if he messes around with strategies he's not used to it helps balance out the game until the better player only wins ~75% of the time.

RATING: 6
There is nothing intuitive about chess. Ostensibly, it is a wargame but really the level of abstraction means it has very little in common with modern wargames. Good players learn all known strategies by heart. It is a skill game - absolutely: there is no random element - in that you try to anticipate your opponent's strategy several turns ahead. All in all, being good at chess requires years of study which is partly the reason it is not a fun game: the learning curve is in the way.

I'll rarely play, but appreciate the world of chess, good balance, but I tend not to like/play games with identical sides/pieces.  High rating due to overall strength and longevity of game (one method of rating is whether I will teach to my future children when they are 10 or so.  Chess is definately one such game).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
No randomness, all tactics and strategy. This is more a sport than a game, it takes massive amounts of time to be able to play this "correctly", so very steep learning curve. Hard to rate, it can be a 10 when played with someone that is about as skilled as you, but it is dull against a stronger or weaker opponent.

For me, chess is too deep.  There are so many moves to consider, every move I end up saying, "I don't know, let's just try this."
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A great game ruined by a heavy past. Too much study has been put into this game, and it's cultural and historical weight make it seem a bigger deal than it actually is. If you don't play this well, you're seen as dumb, and if you play it well (or say that you enjoy playing it) you're "really smart". Bah, I hate silly shit like that. 

It's not really the game's fault that this has happened (can a game be actually blamed for anything?) but that doesn't make these un-inherent flaws cease to exist.

One game design flaw: the possibility of a tied match is very real. Sucks, considering a match can take a while (and take its toll on your mental energy).

I love chess puzzles, though.

Uhh, let's be serious folks!  

This is the granddaddy of strategy games.  There are HUNDREDS of books to help people, tournaments, etc.  If you are a chess player you can go to almost any city and find players.  

Even a king and three pawns vs. a king and 2 pawns is an unbelievably complex game.

Of course, if you win or lose, its just you and the opponent.  Will any other game be there 100 years from now?  I assure you chess will.  Even bridge is fading, but chess is going strong!

If you find a 'chessplayer', they will tell you there just isn't anything else out there.

Only only a slightly better than average tournament player, but even for a player of my rather mediocre strength, there is a beauty here that no other game seems to have.  I've been playing for 30 years and I will never stop.

I dislike abstract games... especially ones like Chess where many moves (e.g. opening strategies) are scripted.  Studying and memorizing the moves and counter-moves is not fun for me.  I like more free-form games with at least a little luck.  Also, Chess is one of those games (like Scrabble) where it is best to play against someone near the same skill level as yourself... because runaway leader games are not fun.

I am really bad at chess.  I just don't have the vision to see the battle lines and weaknesses to exploit.  I tend to spend the whole game reacting.  This tends to be a theme in my board game abilities in general... I play tactically rather than strategically, and eventually I lose to players with vision.  Which I'm OK with since I recognize the deficiency and vow to improve it.  I just wish that I could practice more!  More time to game!

RATING: 7
50 plays:

Obviously, Chess's nearly endless depth is its most powerful feature, and it's hard to balance that with an evaluation of its appeal for casual players.

With that said, I think one of the game's great aspects of accessibility to a casual player is that while there are many possible moves at any one time, there are often only a handful that aren't obviously mistakes, which lightens the experience and lessons analysis paralysis. 

Still, requiring a timer for games to not feel agonizing and sluggish reflects a basic flaw in the game. (Compare to Poker or Backgammon, for example, which are turn-based and have many possibilities but don't require timers.)

I consider chess to be THE strategy game. How many other games have been studied in as much detail as this one, and have so many different names for opening moves, for instance? Why this game is rated so low is a mystery to me. It is a challenging game, but that's no reason to give it a really low score. I'm voting a 10 when I figure out how to vote for games.

The ultimate classic.  

Everyone should play now and then just to improve planning,strategy, and being able to see how things can lay out in the future.  The big thing with this game is that based on playing and ranking it can the win can become way to predictable.  It can be disappinting that you simply are unable to make a showing against the highly skilled.

If you have a person equal in skill there may not be a better two person game.

I played with my dad as a kid and in my 20s I read a ton of books and improved on my computer etc. This game is playable now on lots of internet venues making it more accessible than ever.

The only game I own that I've played longer than Chess is Memory.  I've played this game for fun and for competition.  My only complaint about this game is that once you get above a certain level, it is hard to play games with average players.  I've never liked playing with odds;  honestly, I think that if the better player is patient, odds rarely work.  Playing with clocks has a similar problem.  

With all that said, I'll play Chess any time against any one.  Now if I could only find a good Chess club in Dayton.

What is there to say? No luck and high strategy makes Chess awesome. It's only downsides are finding people to play with, the headaches you will have contemplating your best move, and the regret and second guessing you will inevitably feel if you lose.

Chess. What do you say about chess? It's a classic and I have a Star Wars variant of it...but that's it.
I have a nice looking chessboard that might be displayed at someday when I live in an old mansion on the hill but until then there are too many games to play before I even consider thinking about chess.

I don't REALLY mean I think chess is a sucky game, of course.  I think it must be brilliant, to have captured so many clever minds.  Mine isn't one of them.  I've never had great success with most abstract strategy games, so chess, like go, is one I appreciate, but have no desire whatever to play.  My head just doesn't go that way.  Or to be more precise, if a game is going to require this much study from me, I have to get a great deal of enjoyment out of it to make it worthwhile.  I simply have never gotten that from chess, which makes me rather sad, really.

RATING: 7
RULES: **** - The rules of the game are fairly simple, however, there is some obscure, let's not fear the word, crap, which may confuse new gamers and which actually just doesn't add much to the game at all. However, after you manage to teach people how the god-damn en passant works, the rest is easy going.
STRATEGY: *** - While there is a single goal that you must achieve, chess does offer several paths to it and several playing types you could apply. While this game is definitely more of a tactic type, opening moves may dictate a very swift game with lots of casualties and huge combinations involving lots of pieces or a long and difficult defensive grind, where every move feels like a puzzle to solve.
TACTICS: **** - Chess offer quite a few tactical decisions for a player each turn since there are multiple types of units which are best used in different contexts of the battle, hence there is always a nail-biting search for that perfect move that would counter opponents threats and make some of your own.
LUCK: ***** - This is a zero-luck game, meaning that absolutely everything depends on the skill level of the players. While I find it personally to be a huge advantage, there is a disadvantage that the player who is less skilled will be likely demolished very quick, since the possible skill margin to have an equal game of chess is arguably too little.
PLAYER INTERACTION: ***** - Every move made by your opponent can significantly alter your own plans, thus chess is really one of the best games where the battle between players' minds can be felt.
REPLAYABILITY: ****
THEME: * - Even though it is an abstract modeled after medieval warfare, it is still an abstract. Since I haven't seen towers moving around the battlefield, I see chess more of a huge puzzle on 8x8 grid than a battle between two armies.
BALANCE: ***** -  The sides do play a little bit differently because of the turn-by-turn nature of the game, since white gets a little momentum to attack and black has to defend, but I really don't find black any less likely to win.
DOWNTIME: ** - In this game it is OK to wait whole minutes pondering your next move. Seriously. You have been warned - analysis paralysis is the standard behavior when you play Chess. Thanks for the genius who invented chess clock.
ACCESSIBILITY: ** - This is a difficult one. Normally, finding someone who can play this game is fairly easy. The problems start if you want to play with someone skilled, since the game is just too unforgiving for a rookie, especially if you don't devote time to study chess and don't memorize the huge bunch of default openings.

I have a problem with Chess, not with the game itself, but with the abundance of players out there who make it impossible for novices like me to get anywhere playing this game.  I literally can't find anyone to play with who can't start spouting off like an encyclopedia about opening moves, etc.  I don't stand a chance.  That's why I own so many other abstracts--to even the odds!

I used to play a lot of chess, and I own several chess boards.  I like chess art, although good chess art is hard to find.  But to be good at chess, you have to study and play regularly, and I stopped playing years ago.  

I still like chess puzzles, but my favourite form of chess is [b]Knightmare Chess[/b] now.

Now I prefer lighter games, with more people, and games that incorporate a luck factor.

RATING: 5
I have a love/hate relationship with chess and right now:

Meh....

I used to play tournaments years ago, but have not done so since 1998.  From about 1988-98 I played a lot of chess :)  Now, I'm on to other games, but I still play a game or two (mostly blitz) from time to time.  Classic game which teaches so much in so little time.  Since I've started recording games on the geek: 1660-1088=102.  
 

Update: finally played a tournament for the first time this year (2011) since 1998.  Looking forward to getting back into competition.  :)

Return to tournament play has been good although I did sink down in rating :shake: but broke even for 2011 going +4-4=1 for the year.  :)

2012 has started out well but had a weak finish.  So the year ended with me going +12-11=4 in tournament play.  Cracked 1500 level for the first time rating wise!!! :cool:  :D  Very happy about that!  The year ended badly with two disastrous tournaments.  I won only 1 game in my last 9 :what: :gulp:  Hopefully 2013 will be better.  :)

2013 is off to a terrific start!  I finished second in the 1400-1499 group in the U1700 section of the Land of the Sky XXVI tournament in Asheville, NC.  I also finished second in the U1800 section for the Saturday morning blitz tournament.  As a result, I now have my highest rating ever at 1516! :) Finished the Pittsburgh Open with my new highest rating ever of 1589 and another tie for 2nd in my class.  I didn't play another tournament this year but I did well and hope for some tournaments in 2014.  So I finished 2013 +9-7=3.

First tournament of 2016 was blitz tournament at the VA Closed.  First play since 2013 resulted in a bad showing of 3/8.
So far for 2016 +3-5.

I used to love chess and played it competitively in many local tournaments while in high school and early college. I still have a small library of chess books. Chess is a hugely deep game. As I progressed in my skill level I found a deeper appreciation for the game. I have played 5 minute blitz games along with marathon 5 hour tournment games. I eventually gave up competitive play to focus on my studies and now it is disappointing for me to play at such a lower level than I once did. At higher levels chess suffers from having to memorize various openings, but this is hardly a problem for the beginner. Because chess is purely skill-based with no luck fator, a game of chess between two vastly different skilled players is usually a far gone conclusion and can be very boring. When I have more time I hope to pick chess up again as I met many great people and had lots of fun playing in chess clubs and tournaments.

I play games to have fun and chess is just no fun for me.  The game highly depends on a balance of skill between the players, and to become skilled, you'll really have to invest a lot of time and effort.

I love playing Chess for several reasons.  The first seems strange, but the game can take months.  I love that I can have a heavy game which takes up little to no space (the developed notation systems make it easy to recreate the board).  One thing I hate is playing a heavy war game which will take days (or weeks) to resolve and having to leave the game set up with hundreds of counters knowing that someone's cat will come up and eat/move a piece.  And god forbid if someone sneezes.

Pretty clearly, the best game ever invented, overall.  However, it doesn't resemble other board games as much as, say, golf.  Can easily seem more like frustrating work than fun, especially if you play competitively.  Thanks to my wife's chess club, our boys are getting very, very good.  Can't even count how many sets we have around the house.  Great to take to restaurants.  The invention of the chess clock was a watershed idea, although I admit we use it only rarely.

RATING: 10
Certainly the king of all games.  I wish I was better and had fewer gaming interests so I could give it the attention it deserves.  I've played more Chess, by far, than any other game.I can understand why people don't like Chess: it's complex, painful, rewards repeated play, and the better player will nearly always win. Playing well requires attention and thought--a lot of attention and thought. What I don't understand are all of the ignorant comments about the game on BGG, such as the need memorize openings (not true until you're rated in the upper 1000's or maybe even 2000's; intermediate players will not be able to exploit an opening advantage against  a player who better understands basic tactics and mid-game strategic advantages) or complaints about White's first-move advantage (which is true only once you're good enough to be able to exploit it, which I doubt many BGGer's are; if you're that concerned about the first-move advantage, play Blitz, it vanishes). I get especially annoyed by the latter complaint since few, if any, of the themeless and pallid Euro's that many users are so enamored with would stand up to even a 1/10th of the scrutiny Chess has undergone over the last couple of centuries. Give me a break. 

While it is true that you can't get beyond a fairly basic level without some study, the game's difficulty is overstated. A basic primer on tactics (via a beginner's book and maybe the Chess Tactics Server) will vastly improve your play without any major time commitments (excepting the need to play as much as possible, which once Chess gets it hooks in you, will naturally happen anyway).

All that said, I'm still not so great at Chess and I especially suck at blitz games. Blitz (or bullet or lightening or anything shorter than 30 minutes) is an entirely different game that I haven't even begun to get a handle on. 

Anyway, I'm gushing. I will never get sick of Chess, and to really make clear how much I like the game I should down-grade every other game I've played by .5. I love gaming. Wargames, Euro's, RPG's, whatever, but nothing beats Chess for me. A game that I love with a passion and will always play, despite being pretty much not so good at it.

I played this lots and was never very good at it. I just didn't have the patience or skill and my brother did, so I lost a bunch. This game is truly abstract and good with similarly skilled opponents. I find it not very exciting but it is a classic.

Chess is one of those games everyone should know how to play, really.

I've never been a terribly good chess player, which might explain why I've never been a terribly big fan.  The amount of analysis and literature about it is fascinating, but I would rather play one of its cousin games -- Xianqi for example -- than standard western chess.

I can appreciate how some people can get into this game, but I've grown to realize that I like a little bit of luck in my games... at least a little! A game totally devoid of luck all too easily becomes a battle of "who is smarter," and that's not too much fun.

Update: Just for kicks, I tried chess on the computer. Man, it sucks even more after gaining exposure to all these other wonderful options. Chess is pretty joyless. I don't want to have to study to gain even a modest level of proficiency.

OK, the game is thousands of years old, so that must mean something. Also, it takes a lot of skill and mental dexterity to play well, so that's also a good thing.  However, I never much cared for Chess.  I like a little bit of a luck factor in a game, and there really is none here -- except, possibly, luck in your opponent not catching a sneaky move (which I rarely seem to have).  I still wish I was good at the game, but I guess we all want things.  Not to be confused w/ Chess King -- which is a now defunct clothing store that was popular in the 80's.

Very popular in the West. I used to be deeply fascinated with this game, until I decided to look properly into the world of ancient Chess variants from Asia (Shogi from Japan and Xiangqi from China, for instance).

I still enjoy the occasional game. I have played in several unofficial tournaments and have never been rated, although I once had a theoretical draw against an 1800 ELO player in the endgame which I threw away, for whatever it's worth. Although weak compared to a lot of club players, I am strong enough to virtually always defeat a casual player.

Despite its heritage, chess is actually not all that great. Its rules are pleasingly streamlined for the most part, but for the life of me I just can't get myself to find it fun.

Well, my apartment is decorated with chess sets I've collected from around the world.  One from Chile (the indiginous versus the conquistadors), one from Italy, a marble set with its own stand (where my chess clock sits), and a glass set from Asia.

You really can't knock this game because it's so widespread.  It's everywhere for a reason.  The only reason I knock this game down a point is because for some it is more than a game - and the fun factor begins to disappear when it becomes that for you.  The openings have been overanalyzed, and I don't appreciate that because the real heart of chess is the middle and ending, where real talent comes into play over memorized theoretical positions.

When I lived in Amsterdam, I spent several days a weeks watching masters and the occasional grandmaster play in arenas and in small chess clubs.  I was amazed to simply watch their skill at work.  However, at the same time, I knew I never wanted to get to where they were, because the upkeep required to stay that skilled could better be spent on things in this life that have more meaning and impact.  I play chess for community and sharpening the mind, not for isolation.  But it remains one of the greatest games ever.

I feel it is simply my responsibility as a legitimate game designer and someone who understands and appreciates games on a higher level than the swaths of people who have haphazardly rated it a ten despite having little to no familiarity with other games. I could go on a lengthy diatribe about its various shortcomings but I wont. New games are better. Game design is a science and like any science it become more refined over time. If the current market doesn't reflect this then it reflects only on the lack of refinement of popular designers. Oh and Chess is a game from the dark ages. Its time to move on.

RATING: 5
I played a LOT of chess in my high school days. Literally, almost daily. I attended several tournaments and established a USCF rating. 

I still enjoy abstracts....but I find my interest in a game of chess to just be a very rare occurrence. I still respect the game. I just don't find myself that interested in sitting and analyzing the board for so long. I'd rather play a shorter 2p abstract (like the Gipf games) or a complex 2p wargame (like Paths of Glory). If someone very interested in chess wanted to play, I suppose I could be talked into it. But I'd probably be scheming how to introduce them to Euros. I don't even currently own a chess set.

When I DID play regularly, I tended to use a Queen's Gambit opening (since opponents, at least at the high school level, seemed less comfortable defending it) and a variant of the Sicilian Defense (for about the same reason).

RATING: 6
An overly studied abstract strategy game which is very good, but which is very hard to find similarly skilled opponents for. I think that I prefer this slightly to Go based on the shorter play time, but I have to break down and say that Go still draws me back more, and is the game I have greater respect for. If I was sitting in a coffee house and someone asked me to play a game I will usually sit down and enjoy myself, but the game as such doesn't compel me unless I'm playing against someone who is of roughly equal skill level to me. It's too studied by too many people in North America which makes finding an equally skilled opponent extremely difficult and there is no handicapping feature ala Go. The limitations on the board also feel stifling to me at this point, again, not because the game as such is limited in any sense, but because it has been studied to such a degree that even casually hardcore Chess players know all manner of openings and such which robs the creativity that I look for in games. I know that Go, which I keep comparing this to (as I consider those two games vying for the title of THE abstract strategy game) can have similar issues, but they just don't feel as real here in NA because Go is still a relatively underground phenomenon which means it is very easy for a bad player (me) to find equal foes than it is for me as an above average bad Chess player to find equal foes...if that makes sense to anyone but me. Still, I do like the game as such, I just have trouble finding opponents who make it enjoyable enough for me to rate it higher than 6.

I played this game a lot as a kid. As you can imagine, it doesn't get much play now. Recently I have played a couple team games. This variant calls for two team members to play opposite colors. When a piece is taken from your opponent, you give the piece to your teammate, who can then place it anywhere on his board. We use a timer to make the games fast. The randomness this variant added was surprisingly fun.

The extreme analysis that has gone into this game causes it to lose some of its appeal to me as it can be a game of who has studied the most rather than who can outthink the other fellow. If you can find the right opponent then the game becomes much better. I am curious as to how the gipf series compares to chess.

A great game especially when you can repeatedly play an opponent who is equally skilled as (or preferably slightly better than) yourself. Because there is no luck (except who is white), differences in playing ability often are magnified (the main reason it is not a 10- also I rarely play 2 player games except with my wife). I learned by getting whipped by my father and Nana until I improved to the point where I rarely lost. Now I run school Chess Clubs and enjoy playing the best students and teaching the newer players a little.

I used to like chess as a kid and always thought that someday I'd be able to beat my dad.  I might be able to beat him now, but I'm not interested in it enough to challenge him.  The game has lost its luster since I've been playing it for so long; I'm more attracted to games I've only recently started playing, like Go and Backgammon.

I don't think I'll ever have the patience or dedication to learn this game properly.  I know how the pieces move, but the whole concept of playing defense and offense at the same time, thinking about what I should be doing AND what my opponent is doing, it's just too much to think about.  I play games to escape from thinking.  Maybe someday, when I'm old and gray and have nothing better to do, I'll have the drive to learn how to play this properly.  Or not.

RATING: 10
The oldest one, and said to be the hardest one. Whole generations have been playing and developing its rules. This game is so beautiful being both simple end extremely complex that it's hard to believe that it's man-designed. 

Completely luckless - it's all about skill and (even more important) sheer will of winning.

It helps improving things like memory and logical thinking incredibly well - simply due to its abstraction level and due to how things mentioned above are required.

Unfortunately, because of reasons mentioned above, it will be always underestimated, just like the differences in "skills" will be naturally huge at all times. Luckily, the one who once tried and liked it, will always want to come back for "another game of chess".

You may not agree with that, but it's simply the best board game ever. Period.

RATING: 5
I played chess in primary school because that's what smart kids did. However, I liked the puzzle aspect of chess more than I did the game itself. I was never able to fathom nor appreciate the finer points of chess strategy (strength of 2 bisshops are stronger than one bisshop and a knight, or that a rook and a bishop are more powerful than a queen) and so abandoned the game when there were no more puzzles left for me to solve. The lack of players equal in my pitiful level, a pocket computer which beats me effortlessly, and the superduper analyses in extremis surrounding professionals have turned me off. It is a timeless classic, but in order to play interesting games I'd need to invest more time than I can and am willing to spare. I [i]much[/i] prefer the 'simplicity' of go which at least cuts down on the amount of types of playing pieces, and can be scaled down to smaller boards instead.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Unpopular opinion: chess is less interesting than obscure or historical variants, because of AIs and deeply mapped opening theory. Try Hiashatar, or less exotic Makruk-style games. Of course, many historical variants are just plain terrible... but while I have studied "pure" chess I now regard other games as more lively, as a next frontier of sorts. Also, variants on bigger boards can be slavish and crude, but also tasteful if done well, as in Hiashatar.

RATING: 10
I don't really understand why people who really like games don't enjoy this.  I would guess that partially it is because they have not played competitevly.  There is nothing better than sitting across from someone and trying to destroy their ego...

But really the main complaint seems to be that chess has been studied to death.  Yeah?  So what?  There is still not an answer to the question of, what is the best move?  There is just so much room for variety in chess.  If you get bored sitting for long periods, a chess clock set at 10 minutes can make for a quick brain-bending exercise.  In the mood for a casual game that you can get up from and eat dinner and come back to and still enjoy?  Try chess...

RATING: 10
Discovered the joys of Chess at the ripe old age of 27.  I'm painfully, humiliatingly bad at it, but I can't get enough.  

As much as I hate to give a game this power, Chess can make or ruin an entire day.  That's as close to criticism as I can give.


UPDATE:  The more I play, the more I adore this hoary old game.  It's not the only game I rate a 10, but Chess is my (second) favorite by a huge margin. 

"Painfully, humiliatingly bad" no longer describes me, though I'm far from what would be considered "good" in the Chess world.  I'm actually pretty happy with where I am and would be comfortable staying at this level, which is still well within the realm of "casual" play.  

The bit I wrote before about Chess being able to ruin my day is still somewhat true.  I don't mind losing, that's not the problem, and neither do I beat myself up too much when I blunder.  I mostly play correspondence Chess, and sometimes I'll spend an inordinate amount of time working through the possibilities of a position, treating the game as seriously as if I were responsible for actual living troops on a battlefield.  And if I'm in an uncertain situation, I have a hard time not thinking about it while I wait for my opponent's response.  It's an enjoyable form of stress, but it does tend to consume me when I get locked into that mindset.

---
Update (2013):  I've sort of burned myself out for the time being.  Not just Western Chess but Shogi and Xiangqi as well.  I'm not terribly sure why this is, though I [i]suppose[/i] it might have something to do with a recent string of defeats.  My increasing fascination with Dameo and Amazons also probably shares some of the blame.

Update (2016): For the past few years Chess (and to a  lesser extent backgammon) are practically the only board game I play.  I burned myself out on long correspondence games, but have fallen hard for Blitz.  Other than when relatives visit, I really don't have anyone to play board games with, but Online Blitz fits perfectly into my lifestyle, and I can usually squeak in a game or two per day (and defeats no longer bother me at all; I have, in fact, become quite an expert at losing).

RATING: 5
The all-time most brilliant abstract strategy game (and with the thousands and thousands of variants out there, it's hard to get bored with it).  The ultimate problem though: it's designed as a HEAVY thinking game which means games are only remotely entertaining or challenging when you're paired with someone who's right around your same level of skill.  Newbie players go down way too easy (which frustrates them into not liking Chess) and more thoughtful players will wipe the floor with your butt. So, I recommend looking for variants which even out the playing field a bit.  Fun variants like Knightmare Chess (don't bother with the overpriced cards, just make up your own), or Juggernaut Chess can ease the massive amount of strategy.  With all its faults, though, Chess really is the ultimate test of wits between expert players.

Top 5 all time, sure. Played tons since I was a kid - plenty of blitz, plenty at freechess and chessclub. Read books, studied tactics, openings, and endgames.

Its certainly frustrating that there's always someone out there who is studying their book deeper than you are, and they'll follow the script longer than you and have that slight edge.

It was more fun when I wasn't trying to remember what I think I should know, and was just playing. I guess that's why I end up playing fast games, to hopefully mitigate the study aspect and bring back the excitement and joy of the game.

Chess is also a game that requires similarly matched opponents, so I can't rate it a 10 ... until my kids start beating me - then we'll see. :)

The timeless king and queen of games! :)

A large part of my gaming roots lies in Chess: I have been playing competitive chess for more than 25 years now - mostly in my youth (including large international opens), but recently I at least still play one or two league games per year for my old team. Actually, in the current season I have started to play a bit more again.

Chess is the only base game I rate with a straight 10 and consequently, it also holds the top spot in my Top 10. At least the latter seems unlikely to change in the foreseeable future, so the other games pretty much only compete for 2nd place.

One important reason I hold Chess so dear is its universal recognition around the world. It is a science of its own with so many professional players and many other people who make their living around chess (for instance as trainers or authors). I love the level of analysis that comes with this, the immense wealth of chess literature and software.
This is so much the game of games that it has stopped being "just a game" long ago. I personally mainly view it as a competitive form of mental sport and also as a form of art. I can find great beauty in a masterpiece of chess.

Components: I prefer the more abstract representations of the pieces to those portraying characters of some sort. Assuming heavy pieces on a wooden board, I find Chess to be a handsome game.

Experience: I have a chip on my shoulder about this game: because of its popularity, I'm intimidated and discouraged by the amount of thought that has already gone into strategic play. There's nothing for me to discover, and mostly I'll just make bone-headed moves. Like a handful of other popular games (Go, Scrabble, Checkers), it would be more efficient to study how to play well than to learn by playing.

When I'm pitted against someone with comparable skill, it's a fun puzzle to solve. Each move, offensive or defensive, part of a tight machine, where each component serves a purpose and nothing shifts position without consequence.

Mom gave me a set of wooden chess pieces for my grade 8 graduation gift, in a nice latched vinyl box.  I played a lot of computer chess on a computerized chess board in highschool - I beat it at the top level once.  I played at the University of Saskatchewan Chess Club for a few months.  I think I'm quite a bit better than the average schmuck, but I don't study the game.  My friend from track and field Roger Blum did study the game, and I did manage to beat him once, which was the last time we played.  Other than this one set of pieces, I don't own a nice chess set or chess board.

I'm a bit embarrassed to have this listed as previously owned, but this is only temporary (cats + glass chess set = cracked pieces). This is a case of the rating being absolutely guided by the recommended definitions on BGG as it is brilliant, but I'd always play any of the 8-10 games (and usually the 7s too) in favour of Chess. I think Chess being a two player game exacerbates this, as Twilight Struggle and Through the Ages are my favourite games to play two player (not that the former can be played any other way, of course).

Been playing since I was a kid, and have had multiple chess sets over the years.  My current set is a small glass one (which unfortunately rarely gets used).

UPDATE (September 2013): Have retrieved an old chess set from my parents, contains wooden pieces with a separate (cardboard) board.  My mother is fairly certain that the pieces originally came with a wooden board but no idea on what happened to it.

RATING: 3
Hard to put a number to. This is THE most anylyzed game ever. Meaning that your true ability in the game comes down to your knowledge of published Chess info. So it's no longer a game, but a test of accumulated Chess facts and ideas. Good humans and computers essentially play the game the same way.

Plus, if it were invented today it would just be a very ho-hum abstract, with nothing to differentiate it from more interesting, and perhaps even deeper, abstracts. Like Monopoly, this game only survives due to inertia and gravity.

Chess would be a good game if there wasn't so many bloody books and articles written about how to play!  You can't just sit down with someone and play chess, 'cos chances are that they know a pile of 'opening gambits' and just thrash you at it.  You can't beat them by being clever or witty, you need to read books about chess!  Chess has ceased to be a game, it's just a contest about how much stuff you can remember about how to counter opening moves etc.  If only none of the literature about chess exested, I would probably feel inclinded to rate is 7 or 8 out of 10.

Great game, but you should always have an opponent of the same playing level, otherwise this game is no fun (no luck element); you can increase your level by studying, but I only like to do so to a certain extent; besides I think the charm of the game is lost with it.

I recognize chess as the excellent abstract that has stood the test of time that it is, but I never really find myself wanting to play it. I strongly prefer Go because it is more creative and in a very weird sense "chaotic" rather than the cold and calculating chess.

RATING: 4
I enjoyed the game when I first started as a child, but after a certain point, study and memorisation of openings became the most important factor.

If there were a widely employed handicapping system like in Go, I'd enjoy it more. As is, playing against a superior player will almost never see a surprise win and the game can feel almost like an exercise in futility.

Fun when learning and playing against others of roughly equal skill.

RATING: 6
With a balanced opponent, Chess can be an incredible game...  It's just hard to find a balanced opponent. My favorite way to play right now is versus an adjustable computer opponent.

I'd rather play Go if time isn't an issue, or Xiang Qi if looking for something a bit quicker.

Chess ('Schaak' in Dutch). Played it a lot as a kid. Was even champion of a chess-club once, not that I think I'm that good. Not at all. It's been years since I last played. Did so too much maybe? Still a 10 though.

I've been teaching the basics to my son lately.

Own: a match-standard board with pieces.
Also: a learner set from 1979 including good old vinyl LP's ("Leer schaken met Jan Timman en Hans Böhm")
Also: a handmade foldable box/board and pieces, bought in former Yugoslavia in 1991. More of a souvenir really.

RATING: 10
The ULTIMATE and DEFINITIVE boardgame!

(see bottom line for more details on this subject)
 
The inclusion of this game in my rating list is somehow artificial because it introduces a logarithm scale gap for the 2nd ranked, otherwise that game would score something like 1 (even though beeing also a brilliant game), turning the elaboration of this rating list a pointless task.
The setup is always the same and requires less than half a minute to achieve.
Nothing more than 32 pieces and 64 squares provide the scenary for an endless number of games of infinite variability, where everything is at sight all the time and there´s no absolut room for chance, meaning that the outcome is the direct result of the interation between your actions and those of your opponent.
The rules can be thaugth in less than 10 minutes but the learning curve is virtually infinite, beeing usual to only begin taking full pleasure of the game´s potencial after several months of practice, several times a week (this is perhaps it´s  only major drawback).
The progression in the game skill is the result of a combination englobing motivation, practice, study and talent, by that order.
By this same reason, there is no chance a lesser skilled player can put up a fight to a much higher skilled player, and this is usually subject of some criticism but, then again, is not the persue of perfection a natural desire of humans?! Does not happen the same when training sports, music or arts?! Sure it happens, and that´s the reason why chess is also a bit of a sport, a bit of an art and a bit of a science.
Not just through the global strategy, but even sometimes just through the mere visualization of a set of moves, it is possible to outline the main features of a player´s personality, since, over a chess board, all of one`s fears, all of one`s courage, all of one`s wisdom, all of one`s stamina, all of one`s knowledge, all of one`s arrogance, etc, come to life in flying colors. 
That´s how, just through a couple of games between two average (or better) players it´s possible to perceive how each of them thinks and feels, not just like a player, but also like an individual. 
Chess has its rules settled down for the last 500 years, however, before that period , there were (at least) another 10 centuries in which those rules were beeing tuned to optimization and balance. 
The result was a mechanism of perfection, a masterpiece capable of produce jewels of beauty and aesthetic pleasure in which the players function like no more than pieces of a greater show, even though are their brains, their imagination and their creativity the source behind all what´s visible.     
I own more than 30 different chess sets, have been playing it for 30 years now and have done, for sure, more than 10 000 games until this point.
I play chess by heart, i play it blinfold, i play it whenever and wherever someone is looking for a game.
Perhaps was the will to escape the "matrix" of a chess board that lead me into the world of modern boardgames!...

Bottom line: I own a game of Go and (kind of) know the rules, but never played a single game. From what i read and ear, is perhaps the only game that could (i underline "could") go beyond chess.

I generally find Chess to be too dry for my tastes, and most of the people I know aren't interested in playing. My wife will play, but she is much better than me, so it's no fun to play someone who will beat you 75% of the time. The only time I really like playing Chess is when I play "Chess Titans" on my computer, and then only when I have the difficulty level dialed down to "1"!

- Gameplay and replayability: 3/3. Thoroughly enjoyable and competitive game that never gets boring. The only thing I regret is that computer opponents are too strong, making it very frustrating to play against. Even grandmasters have a hard time beating computers, giving somewhat the feeling that the game is "solved".

- Luck factor: 3/3. No randomness involved, only pure strategy.

- Duration: 3/3. One game takes approximately half an hour to play.

- Player range: 1/3. 2 players only.

- Theme and looks: 2/3. There is no theme and even expensive Chess sets are not that beautiful in my opinion. However, given the long history of the game, a chess board is classy and breathes nostalgia. 

- Set up/clean up time: 3/3. Less than 5 minutes.

- Learning curve: 2/3. The rules can be explained in 10 minutes. 

- Durability: 3/3. A good chess set will last forever.

- Portability: 3/3. If you buy a travel chess game, you get maximum portability.

- Summary: Lots of strategy and replayability for 2 players. Best short game I've played so far.

We were a chess family for about 4 years - clubs, tournaments, camps, a dedicated chess room, running giant chess in the park, hosting a Russian grandmaster, etc. Then our son quit and eventually our enthusiasm died out. Still have over 50 trophies on the mantel -- one mine, three father-son, the rest our now-teenager's, who I don't think even remembers his chess years much.

Chess is not a well designed or easy to understand game, like Hex or even Go. It was designed "by committee" over hundreds of years. Once you have internalised the rules, however, you are privy to the entire history of this wonderful pastime, the toils and struggles of so many to understand and teach the game, an absolute litany of resources, including expert computer opponents awaits anyone trying to master this game of abstract strategy. The cultural and intellectual legacy and international community of chess is what makes it great, despite its very large first player advantage, its arcane and illogical rules and its tendency to be extremely drawish at high levels. I learned it as a child and I still enjoy learning.

One of the best things about Chess is that you can play it with non-gamers. It is a bit strange, in my opinion, that to really become an accomplished player, you must study and/or memorize famous games. Personally, part of what I like about games is figuring out strategies. This doesn't keep it from being a very approachable game with plenty of lasting power.

You may be asking why did I rate Chess, the venerated game of kings, so low?

Time commitment. Beyond learning the basics of chess (how pieces move, board position, etc), chess requires an absolutely ludicrous amount of time to play with any proficiency. The worst part, and the part that breaks my heart, is that this is not through an fault of the game but though its widespread success and acceptance. There are so many people who play chess, who study it, who participate in tournaments, and so on. Because chess is a game purely based on the skill, the better player will pretty much always win. That's fine, that's balanced, but it's not fun if you're the unskilled player. Frankly, it's not much fun if you're the skilled player either. It's only matches of equal ability that really brings out the tension of the game. Such matches are perhaps easier to find in the digital age, but within a home or group a friends, not so much.

Don't get me wrong, Chess is an absolute classic and a wonderful game. I just don't want to spend thousands of hours on one game just to still be a novice at it.

It's a classic game, probably deserving of a higher rating. But it has been so extensively studied that one has no chance of playing it well unless he is prepared to spend months immersed in books about chess, memorizing play sequences.  And I don't want to do that. It also suffers from repetitive opening sequences, which tend to be kind of boring, and it feels very crowded, with so many pieces on such a small board. I much prefer Shuuro, since I believe it fixes almost everything I find annoying in Chess, and especially Arimaa, which is not really that similar to Chess, but somehow occupies the same niche of brain stimulation.

Of couse this is a great game.  But I will only "play sporadically if in the right mood".  Why?  Because it can take a LONG time to play.  On the other hand, if I was rating 5 minute speed chess, I'd probably give it a 8.  And 5 minute Chinese (or Bug-eyed) speed chess (the one with two games and partners) I might have to give it a little higher (but I don't know since I haven't played it in 10 years).

Hard to rate - often as an experience it would be a 5 (mismatched oponents or taken too seriously, for my taste), typically a 7 but at it's best a 9.

RATING: 7.5
I quite enjoy chess and used to play it a lot in my youth, though not particularly well. These days I tend to prefer other games if I want to play a two person abstract game (Dvonn, Lost Cities, Cityscape, Quoridor are my current favorites)

The pure logic classic. I collect chess sets and love the way a good set looks on display. I always think I really don't want to play chess, but when I do, it's a great game.

RATING: 9
Tournament results (years ago): Beat everyone I played rated 1800 or below. Lost to everyone I played rated 2200 or above. Stopped playing when I realized that if I wanted to successfully continue, I would have to start memorizing openings on a daily basis, not where I wanted to put my time, effort, and life. Did get to pull off a Bishop and Knight endgame checkmate in a tournament game. Had an audience of about a dozen people for that one.

Most of its detractors are correct: the better player always wins, it rewards preparation and study, and its heavy on analysis.  All of which makes it the greatest game ever.  This is the game that got me into gaming.

Boredom exemplified.  I do not want to plan out the same series of moves in different sequences while projecting my opponents potential choices to see where I might be vulnerable to zzzzzzz...

Chess is the perfect example of game as work.  I loved games from early childhood and this was a game I'd play and wish it were as fun as I knew games should be.  It instilled in me a deep loathing for two-player abstracts.

I appreciate the brilliance of this game, but it's just an average game for me.  Too much studying is required to do well...opening strategies, etc.  I've never been a huge fan of abstracts either.  Fun to play once in awhile with someone of equal talent.  It's no fun to crush or get crushed.

Chess will still be played a thousand years from now, when other games on BGG will have come and gone.  

Chess is a game that can be bought with plastic pieces and a cardboard board for a few dollars, or one can buy very expensive sets made out of material like marble.  It can be found everywhere.

Chess has very few rules to learn, and is easy to set up.

A pure test of skill.  Chess can be a "heavy game" since it can take a great deal of play, study, and thinking to become good at it, but you can be as competitive or recreational as you want to be.

I am not great at it, but I know I am playing a great game every time I pull it out.  

How many other games on BGG have thousands of books and articles written about them.  This game can only be a ten (10).

Its weird to say this, but its just a little too abstract for me. I like more concrete territory control games. I can usually see a few moves ahead - but I just don't have a natural grasp of the game flow, despite 100s of plays. It doesn't help that I mostly play against more serious players who have memorized openings...

Despite all the significance it has regarding boardgaming, I especially don`t like:

The slow start / fixed patterns ...

The queen. Too important for a single piece.

The crowded board. Half of the squares is occupied!

The sometimes dull endgames with a runaway king and some pieces making one obvious move after another.

Of course, I don`t like all that, because I am not a good player ... ?

I only play blitz chess (usually online). I don't have the time or motivation to put into playing chess more seriously. Lack of motivation comes mostly from the fact that I don't have enough self discipline to scan the board thoroughly and therefore make silly errors (which is the long way of saying I suck at chess).

Chess is not my cup o' tea... too abstract, and it requires a type of patience and discipline that I just don't have. I admire those who play it well, though. It's obviously a brilliant game. My rating reflects the fact that I just don't enjoy playing it (rating criteria as defined on BGG).

Chess is a classic game.

I used to play Chess all the time in primary and high school. I rarely play Chess today. I guess I out grown it. Or maybe today, I have access to more interesting games.

By having not played a lot over the last couple of years, it did not help with my game. I am a bit rusted. It played a few games in last couple of years and I didn't win that much. Chess needs to be played on a regular basis in order to stay sharp and focus on the game you play.

Chess is a 2 player game. I rarely play 2 player games today. It`s the reason why I don`t have that many 2 player games in my collection.

I own the Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring chess set and played with it a few times. It is very nice chess set. 

I just might get the Return of the King version. I don't know yet. Is it really worth having two chess sets of Lord of the Rings ? The pieces are a different characters and color.

One might think one chess set is enough, but Lord of the Rings is...well Lord of the Rings!

I might really consider it if my games played of Chess increases.

Got as a gift 3-1 Chess, Checkers, Backgammon set made in glass.

2 plays since recording games played.

I'm not sure Chess is fun.  Go to chess.com, look at the tournament pics, do they look like they're having fun or sitting on the toilet?  I find people take this game way too seriously or else are afraid of it.  Nowadays, I feel it takes too long to finish (isn't chess why game clocks were invented?), I've always detested the high AP in my opponents, and that one wrong move can cost the game after an hour, hour and a half.  More worringly, is the frequency games can end in unsatisfying stalemates.  The concept though that you have to intentionally sacrifice certain pieces in order to progress is intriguing, but perhaps more of a play style.

Look, I realise this is 600 year old game and I get its mystique, but it's much overrated based on nostalgia or some sort of game cum mental puzzle, and seemingly more of a spatial, IQ gladitorial contest for fellow braniacs.  But as a game that should be fun?  It doesn't really hold-up and I don't think many people, myself included, really get that much enjoyment out of playing it, decryingt that they moved their finger  off, or waiting for their go, when compared to everything else sitting on our shelf, harddrive or cloud we could otherwise be playing instead.

This is where it all started for me. My mother taught me this game in the 3rd grade and whupped me every time. Later I found out she was the Chess Champion of her town in Puerto Rico. My 2nd grader has her Abuelas genes.  Whips this out and plays a good game against her 50 year old dad. I have played this since I was in the 3rd grade. Way more than my listed plays.

I rarely enjoy playing this; it's too dry, and I'd rather play something less abstract given the chance.  Still, the mood sometimes strikes me to play; I don't always indulge it.  I actually prefer Steve Jackson Games' Proteus.

Absolutely unfun unless the players are very evenly matched, and the fact that people say the words, "If you want to get into chess I recommend you buy some of these books," just says enough about how that's more effort than I think it's worth. Chess may be a great hobby, but it's not a great part of the hobby of boardgaming.

My wife was a chess geek in high school and so to this day I have only ever beaten her once.  As such, we rarely play because I'm not much of a challenge but on occasion we do get out the board, the clock and have a spirited game of "Mike are you sure you want to do that?"

Someone could argue to me that chess is a game for the ages. I would not argue that, in fact I may agree. That said, I do not care for games that take lifetimes to master or games that promote the play of only one game (see my similar rating for poker).

I just can't see myself playing chess with any type of enjoyment, unless I was helping a child develop linear problem solving skills.

As both a Euro and wargamer, I respect this game as clearly as game of skill and substance, as well as an interestingly accurate model of pre-modern warfare. Played it when I was young.

RATING: 7.5
A classic abstract strategy game, worthy of a high rating, but the setting needs to be right to play it, and other games tend to be pulled out quicker.  Some of the chess variants like suicide and atomic are also fun, as is internet blitz chess, or face to face blitz with a [url=http://www.boardgamegeek.com/image/425859]digital chess clock[/url].

Also enjoyable are:
[gameid=12608] - also known as Fischer Random Chess, and levels the playing field for people not as familiar with all the standard openings.
[gameid=14188] - A partnership chess game where the pieces you capture can be placed by your partner on his board.  Chaotic, crazy, fast, and fun - less "serious" than regular chess.  Two chess clocks are needed for OTB play, but the best online play for free is at www.freechess.org, with each team usually having either 3 or 5 minutes total.
[gameid=95915] - Like bughouse for two players
[url=http://www.chessvariants.org/link2.dir/srchess.html][i]Stanley Random Chess[/i][/url] - a modern classic played at schemingmind.com
There are many other possible chess variants (see [url=http://chessvariants.com]chessvariants.com[/url]), I enjoy Atomic Chess and many others.

I used to play chess a lot, back in junior high and high school. I played at tournaments. It got to a point where I was so anxious thinking before and during games that I had to stop. I haven't played in years. I still enjoy bughouse chess but hardly ever get to play it.

All time classic and one of the best games ever invented.
I will admit it shortcomings, it only is good with opponents that are of equal ability. I never took the time to really remember any openings, and would be crushed by a ranked player for sure. Still, this is fun when playing regular players, pure strategy, no luck at all. I can't say anything bad about it, other than it has been over-analyized by humans. It, IMO, deserves a 10.

I would probably enjoy Chess if I put effort into learning its strategy, but I don't want to do that.  I don't really find anything about it compelling enough to make me want to read complex strategic analysis.  I'm also not really the biggest fan of abstract games.

RATING: 6
Just for 2.  The perfect game.  However, especially in the later stages of the game it takes too long for me to figure out all the moves in all their advanced steps--I often forget,  get impatient and move, belatedly realizing the move was one I had considered and had thrown out earlier.

I don't like so much downtime in this huge brain burner of a game.

My rating is based more on the fact that Chess is a game that hardly scales.  I mean the enjoyment is solely based on how equally skilled the players are; if one player is more experienced and skilled, he will not get much out of beating his opponent.  It does make for a learning experience but the enjoyment turns into masochism if you are consistently beaten by better players.  Having been in that position (being beaten) for a long time, I can appreciate that this is one of the better games, but for entertainment there are lots of games that can pit better players against less skilled ones and still give a fighting chance to all involved.

I loved Chess, but will pick any other board game over it now. Games go on forever, and it's about thinking many moves ahead (which I'm not fond of while unwinding). It's mainstream so you can find players, but too abstract for my tastes. I do hate the effort you have to spend avoiding blunders.

It does hold a place in my heart; I was saddened when AI beat Kasparov, and if there's a game nearby I'll check it out.

Sadly I have basically no one to play with. Or anyone who will play to my speed. I don't really like to think to much about moves it just bogs the game down. If there is money or some sweet prize on the line feel free to take your time. Otherwise, just move one of your pawns if you can't think of a move in 120 seconds.

When i want a brain burner this is served up. Classic and respected game in the western world however I now realize that there is so much more out there. There are many aspects of chess that I dont like: no talking, very tense, brutal, one player must crush the other, painful to play when you are behind. However it has been the best game for much of my life. The worse part of this game is both players need to be of equal ability. I must really devote more time to playing GO as so many have such great things to say about it.

6/27/2015-My score is 9.3 .dc


6/29/2015-The reason I like this one is it's a wonderful strategy game. The pieces can be anything you want it to be.
The deep level of thinking allows you to think 2,3,or even 10 moves ahead. You can also think up several hundred combinations to checkmate the opponents king.
These and more reasons conclude that this is a great game ,and it has so much replay ability(In my humble opinion of course).dc   



Really fun and strategic.xs

a classic game of perfect information. Not my favorite, but I respect it and play every once in a while, but usually not if there are other options of games to play. I beat other non-chess players usually, and get crushed by anyone that knows opening moves and gambits.

I have multiple sets, as I keep getting them as gifts from folks who know I like 'games'. I have a nice stone set and a funky modern design with lime and blue pieces that are available for trade.

====

Although Chess is no longer my favorite abstract game, I've spent so much time at a Chess board in my life that I'll admit a level of deep nostalgia still lingers. In addition to nostalgia, Chess is the only board game officially sanctioned and taught in my sons' school. Therefore, they and I play an awful lot of Chess games during any given year. Many of our games are teaching games though so I rarely log them. Even still, I enjoy these times and "quality time" so I suppose another layer of nostalgia is being added to my personal Chess history.

Not sure how to rate chess.  It is truly a great, great game.  Every once in a while, I get the bug to study it a bit.  Then I play some crappy chess program set to 'moron' difficulty, lose horribly, and put it aside again for a few years.  I gave it a 6 because I just don't have much motivation to play.  I will never do this game justice.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
It's impossible for me to rate this accurately.  I feel it's a classic game but I have little desire to play it anymore.  People get stuck in the muddy middle where they're better than the few folks they have to play it with but are no match for the "Lifers" who live, eat, and breath Chess study. 

Those folks make the game less enjoyable as it ceases being a game and more some sort of evangelical event.

The same sort of folks have been ruining other games for years (Scrabble), so...the best advice is to play it a handful of times with people you know and will enjoy the company with--and then move on.

I would have to be dragged into a game of this with someone I did not know.

RATING: 7.847
Chess is enjoyable; but not socially!  And I have never really learnt any opening moves (nor have the desire), and so will always be destined to lose to a person who does. Yet, chess is a board game where there can be these tiny moments of beauty rarely experienced in ther games.  Internet postcard chess I now find is far more fun than a face to face brain burn.  On occasion I enjoy the deep thinking over a chess board, but the main purpose of a game meeting should be the social company - hence will pull out a Eurogame.  An enjoyable game if you manage to find someone at your level to play postcard chess (rating 7), but as a social game, It's a 3.  Therefore, average rating is 5) (11/12/08). UPDATE: I have softened a bit with my assessment, as I have had a number of good games with my son.  Chess is the Beatles White Album of games, just enjoy this game with its amazing history (Rating: 7.847, Sept 16).

I really shouldn't rate it, I never played seriously. I'm just too lazy to think several steps in advance, and also I don't like playing against a considerably stronger opponent, and almost everyone is considerably stronger than me at chess (except maybe my daughter, but she's got her own variant where the pieces go mainly in the mouth in the early game and then to some far-out-not-even-in-your-dreams-you'd-think-of-looking-there place, and she beats me at that game so). I'll just keep to go for that 'abstract strategy grand traditional awe-inspiring' game itch.

Kids game whose only appeal is that it was invented long ago before there were better (or pretty much any other) games.  As such it was studied to death and people think it is somehow deeper than modern games.  Had Puerto Rico or Settlers of Cataan been invented in 100AD no one would ever have heard of Chess.  Game is a brain locker, takes too long, provides no chance for beginners to win, has no theme.  Only reason this is not a 1 is since everyone knows how to play it, you can always play a game.  The winner is usually determined before the game starts, based on the players skill (and this from someone that would probably beat 95% of the people in the world if I played them).

This is the king of the games.  I'd rank it up there with Go and GIPF.  If only Chess started with a "G", then we could have the three Gs!  Anyway, I was raised on this game, suffer analysis paralysis often, and rarely play it anymore because of lack of opponents and frustration.  A classic that can never be dethroned, whatever way emotions are running.

Chess is one of those games that I enjoy because of its history, and complexity.  I've never been good at it, and don't know if I will.

Where it all begins- usually as a kid. And it's often either hated or loved from the start. Chess is strategy stripped down to bare essentials, with no need for theme, just an arena where 2 minds can clash. I played since the age of 8 and slowed down in my early teens. It's not played as much any longer, except with my daughter or wife at times --- or vs my iphone ap. But it's still appreciated. Like it or not, it was, is, & will always be a classic destined to outlast almost any game listed on the Geek (save maybe for 'Go'- another classic). It's more stressful than many games and the only way, as I see it, to get the most out of Chess is when 2 opponents are of relatively equal ability (which is when it shines). If not, then it's a tough experience for the loser.

I think of this as the perfect game, as far as abstracts go. It's very draining and I really only play several times a year, but it is always glorious.

I love how the game progresses, I love putting people in/being put in predicaments, I love how each move can pry your brain, I love the surprise of a move you hadn't considered. There's nothing like the satisfaction of an brilliant move, nothing like the devastation of being on the other end. Chess is beautiful.

I've been playing this at the high school I teach at recently, and it's pretty fun. Games can get dull or even painful if there is a huge disparity between skill levels, and of course it's hard to learn for beginners. But it's a quick, solid, strategic game that always has some good tension and fear surrounding it.

I'm always up for a good chess game with someone that has some experience playing.  I started when I was around 12 with my Godmother's son who was an excellent player.  He was in is 20's when he taught me and was a very good teacher of the game.  He taught me how to defend my pieces well.  He didn't show me too much offense and that's where I lack and need improvement.  My wife and I play occasionally and my son is getting better each time we play.

[Original comment] How can I not rate chess highly? It is the game from which all other challenging games stem (in my opinion), but not one I want to play everyday.

May 2009 -- I rarely play any 2-player games these days, and Chess isn't high on the list to use my time in that way. Still, I have to say that it is one of the greatest games ever invented.

2012 March -- I have begun playing chess again, with my son-in-law and my grandson via our iPhones. I am not logging the plays here, but I am enjoying playing the game again.

2013-November:  My son-in-law and I continue to have a chess game going on our iPhones constantly.

RATING: 3
This game requires too much thought and practice to be worth it. Who wants to memorize openings and study others' games? Chinese chess is a decent alternative, mostly because the pieces behave in more interesting ways and fewer Americans know how to play, meaning that players will play on a more even playing field.

My biggest problem with Chess is that usually the only way to get a game with someone who isn't way better or way worse at chess is to go to a chess club/tournament.  Chess is simply not too much fun for me if my opponent and I aren't roughly at the same level.

Pure strategy gaming.  Some 'variants' which I've learned from the Chess Club are a blast, such as Siamese Chess (aka Bughouse Chess).  Best part about chess it that it is ubiquitous.  You can visit people you've never met and play a game with no need to go over the rules.

The only game, so far, which I have rated a 10. Chess is the King (direct, tough, unforgiving, war-like), Go is the Queen (sly, subtle, nuanced, beautiful) of all games. I rate Go slightly lower since there needs to be only one rule set instead of several.

1-29-09:  Haven't played in years.  I can't see myself not having a set around, but it sure is getting dusty.

Basically this game is overrated abstract. There are much better abstract board games available nowadays. This game is based on pattern recognition and knowledge about chess, not so much on logical thinking and creativity. Of course, there is some creativity in combinations. Chess puzzles yes - good puzzles. Chess is like Monopoly - not a good game, but classic, that's why everyone knows it. :)

I hate this game. There is no chance. It is often touted as the basis for strategy, like if you can't win this one then you're a bad strategist. I can win other games but not this one. I never win.

All the criticisms are true. However IMHO there is no better gaming expirience than playing with another chess player with 5 minutes on each clock. This is only game I've literally played 1000's of times. Online chess, or speed chess in the park for a buck tend to be my favorite. When I'm losing and force the stalemte might just be more satisfying than a close win.

The king of games. The reasons I am not too happy to play it (I will though with right people) is that requires people to be on about the same strategic level.

Played 100+ Probably played more than any other game I own yet I still feel uncomfortably out of my depth when playing someone good. If I don't win I feel bad because I will no doubt have done something dumb. If I win I feel bad for my opponent who most likely did something dumb. At this moment in time I really don't like chess thus the low rating. Feb 04 *UPDATE* Played a couple of games recently and they were not decided by mistakes. This improves the experience a lot I'll up the rating. July 08

To be clear, I've rated this game based on staying power. I am only vaguely interested in the strategic literature of this game, and do not play it much anymore. Games with perfect information systems are not really "games" as I understand them, but belong to a different order of human interaction.

My favourite board game. I learned the moves at age 11, and have been playing ever since (I'm nearly 50 now!). The game still fascinates me with its complexity and strategies. I also like how chess notation allows me to enjoy great games by great players from the past.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
It's a great game, deserving a 10, obviously; my rating reflects my personal liklihood of agreeing to play (not at all), as per BGG's rating system.

I suck at Chess beyond belief. Help with getting better wasn't forthcoming, except for suggestions to memorise combinations of good opening sequences that other people had already developed over the centuries. Yuck. 

I suppose if I want my brain to burn, I'd rather I was pushing wooden cubes around in a medium-weight Euro.

RATING: 8.02
Chess is the ultimate deterministic strategy game. Not only is it easy to learn, it provides a virtually infinite number of possible end-game states as far as the human mind can understand them. Even though chess is a solved game, the fact that there is no randomness (but for the choice of white and black) means there is always a stochastically optimum move. However, playing against any given player may require adaptation because the stochasticity changes with the playstyle of the opponent. Easy to learn, but never simplistic.

RATING: 9
Chess is really the game that I blame for my descent into the war gaming world. I remember when I learned it as a child I wanted to get good. That right there is a major flaw because as the rules are simple enough but the weight of the pure strategy of the game is super deep. I have wasted more time reading books on chess than I have at playing almost any other game. I have played chess the most and my son became truly a good chess player. While I can play almost anytime I find the randomness of true war games more fun than a pure strategy game like chess. Still chess is one of the games that cross cultural and language barriers and for that I believe chess will remain for some generations to come a true classic.

RATING: 5
This game would be an 8, except for two things.  1) I'm not good at it, and so I pretty much always loose against a skilled player.  2) No luck, no chance, so my lack of skill dooms me every game.

RATING: 6.5
Basic chess is too over analyzed, and able to be played more by rote rather than creative thought if so desired.  I tend to do the same few opening moves in standard chess, even without any "study" of books, manuals, etc.  This is probably my fault for falling into the same patterns.  Evenso, the always the same set up doesn't help this situation.  Give me a variant and/or casual play, and my rating for fun increases. Look @ Seirawan Chess or Chess 960 for easy to get in to variants that I like much more.

Close to as much complex, abstract strategy as you can pack into a small board and a few pieces.  If you like to collect games for their looks, you can't go better than a well-crafted chess set.  As far as the overall "fun" factor, though, I don't think chess is a good choice.  It's too serious--I play games to have fun, not to pull my hair out.  It has one thing I hate about board games: experienced players will always trounce newbies.

I appreciate the strength of chess but rarely have the urge to improve my game through study, which leaves me in limbo play-wise. I generally play this against a computer opponent, so I can fine tune the AI for a 'sweet spot' challenge. Despite this, it's not often that I feel like a game.

I have a handful of great memories surrounding this ancient game, but I still feel intimidated by it.  It's the kind of game that if you lose, you can only blame yourself and bow to your opponent.

I don't like chess.  I WILL teach young people and players who do not know how to play chess how to play chess.  I think it is an important game for everyone to learn, but it is relatively boring, there is a VERY DEFINED metagame, and I am simply bad at it.  On a more abstract level, the game is like a very long tic-tac-toe, for I have come to learn, that there is no downside to being white.  Racist...

I can't presume to rate Chess.  It's a different game depending on the level at which you're playing.  I find the pieces and board elegant and beautiful (can't stand "theme" sets) and both the tactics and strategy fascinating and metaphorically applicable to real life.  However, at the tournament level, which I dabbled in, it becomes a game of rote memorization.  Did you study the Exchange Variation of the Caro Kann with Panov/Botvinnik Attack before our match or have I stumped you?

Chess is probably the game that first instilled the boargamegeekness in me. I was taught by my Dad and I spent years trying to beat him (I eventually did)

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like it, even though I'm not very good.  I get the idea if I played a lot I'd improve, but playing once every couple of years just isn't doing it for me.  The game doesn't have enough random elements to ensure novices have a chance to beat experts.  I know for a lot of folks thats a selling point, but for me, it is only a selling point if the game has enough variety that I want to play it 10,000 times.  Chess has very little variety as the board and pieces are static.  A lot of its popularity is basically self-perpetuating.  Its popular because its popular.  I like the game and I'd play it a lot more if I had a willing opponent with a similar skill level.  However, I don't like knowing I am going to win or knowing I am going to lose before every game, and that is what chess brings if your opponent is much better than you.

Wonderful abstract game. Can be learned at a young age and has much strategic depth. Although I despise the fact that to be competitive means memorizing openings, learning them actually can make you a better player. Room for creativity, with lots of different tactics (development, sacrifice, point values, pins, forks, etc.). Unfortunately, it isn't much fun unless you are at a reasonably similar skill level.

more you play and the better you get the more enjoyable it becomes.  I used to think it was all about calculating lots of moves ahead and then I discovered although you have to think things through you can play well just by commanding space, setting your pawns in good formations, not wasting time/moves on silly things and building pressure on the board with your strong pieces which then allows you to use tactics such as pins and fork attacks.  You then pressure your opponent into destruction.

Chess has got to be one of the best games around. I just can't give it a full 10 though simply because I feel Go is a better game. It's always easier to find opponents for chess though. Every time I play, chess forces me to think and rethink about the position on the board, the possible moves that can be played, the consequence of every decision you  make having sometimes very different results than what you were expecting. Chess has also taught me patience, perseverance and humility: you just have to recognize defeat when it happens. Its a battle of minds and it can be pretty violent at times. Kasparov once said that chess is the most violent sport there is. I own several chess sets.

An absolutely timeless classic. I learned to play this in third grade (as a part of the provincial math curriculum at the time) and its been a big part of my life since (e.g., chess competitions in elementary and middle school, frequent matches in undergrad, online chess on and off). 

While the game doesn't come to account for differing levels of skill very well, when it does the matches are incredibly deep -- it's always interesting how different people approach the game. I'm also fine with losing a game to someone far more experienced than I am -- especially if I learn a thing or two from my defeat.

In order for this game to be fun you need to find a few people at the same skill level as you. This game rapidly becomes frustrating or boring if the skill-levels vary by a noticeable difference.

The classic perfect information game.  I have unfortunately been subject to carnivorous chess players in my young age, which has driven me away from chess.  I will only play it if it is friendly, and my opponent is at a similar skill level as myself.  

The game itself isn't bad, what I object to is the culture of "I'm better than you" that is wrapped around the game.  It is all about intellectual superiority.  I prefer games to involve some cooperation and a small to medium amount of luck.  I would like games to be accessible to various levels and various strategies, and to sometimes reward weaker players.  I also want game sessions that allow some socialization.  

If a person leans towards chess instead of family board games, I will suggest traditional card games first (such as Cribbage or Spades).

It takes one day learn, but a lifetime to master.

A timeless classic, and maybe the ultimate board game.
Probably the most-known game overall, which, opposed to traditional card games, has this one set of rules no matter where you play.
(Of course there are still countless alternations like fairy chess - which is a lot of fun too, but traditional chess is THE game.)

Also it's probably the most scientifically studied one, both regarding strategies to solve chess problems as well as regarding positive effects on those actively playing chess.

I'm myself neither an active chess player nor particularly good at it. Nonetheless, i love it.

First-move advantage aside, this is also one of the fairest board games i know.

I guess the average score is just slightly above 7 because not everyone (me included :D) gets as much fun out of playing it as he or she gets from a more light-hearted, colorful and/or action-filled game.

But i consider this game pretty much perfect, therefore this gets a full 10/10 from me.

A very cool looking chess set - basic cardboard board, but the pieces are really neat looking and, rather importantly to me, very durable. The only downside is that the cave trolls - bishops for the black side - are a bit on the large side, and can kind of be annoying to move around. Still, a nice chess set for everyday play if you're a Lord of the Rings fan.

Chess is fascinating to learn from someone who is enthusiastic and keen to discuss strategy.  I have the benefit of having such a friend whose skill far outweighs mine but who still takes great pleasure from playing against me and discussing where my options lie.

Got me started with the whole "game obsession" thing.  Thanks, Uncle Dick.  Despite how important and elegant chess is, I sometimes just don't want to play it.  Must be in an "abstract" mood.

You could argue that this is a perfect game (the en passant rule is a little clunky, but what the heck), however the decision tree, while vast, is much smaller than that in Go and this enables huge lines of play to be memorised by top players. I haven't really played since I was at school, when I soon discovered that I wasn't very good and wasn't prepared to make the investment in study needed to improve. I couldn't play this casually, it's too much like hard work.

Not my favorite classic abstract, but I've still been fond of the game from an early age. It's one of those games that makes you think, and I like that. It's not perfect (white has an advantage, for example), but it still has a nice geometric design to the whole thing, and it's little wonder that it's been seriously played by millions over hundreds of years. Been taking the game more seriously myself as an adult, and even joined a chess club.

I picked up a juicy Michael Graves edition board on clearance.  Aside from the awesome components I have to say I still enjoy the game to this day.  Chess is the root for most games we have as it's the original deep and engaging game that took host to players mental creativity (screw you Go, I'm a westerner!).  I enjoy a brain burning game every now and then, but I'm still far too amateur to play with a clock or the like.  Regardless, Chess is a great game if not the first feminist game ever - I mean just look at that Queen go and kick ass...

The great grandparent of abstract, skill-focused games. It probably doesn’t deserve its reputation as the mascot for snooty, academic intellectualism, but it demands thought and attention to detail like very little else. It can be a bit daunting to catch onto.

I’m surprised it doesn’t do *all that* well among board gamers generally — maybe the lack of a theme? But I don’t play games for the theme.

RATING: 8
I'm one of those hipsters that thinks Chess is still pretty cool.

Is it perfect? No. But it IS still a great "perfect information" abstract strategy game that rewards creative thinking, malleable tactics, and strategic planning all equally. It is very rewarding to learn the game and get better, and a joy to play face to face with another equally skilled opponent. Don't play chess against computers except for learning and to kill time, or it will suck the soul out of the game. 

It's not for everyone, obviously. It can hurt your brain to use it so much, I understand. And I definitely dislike the culture of "openings" (which is why I love variants like Chess960), but despite any minor flaws the game might have, I would always recommend anyone to give it a try. 

I feel it's a little too "cool" to bash on older games these days, especially Chess. I personally think it's a great game, and worthy of it's classic status.

RATING: 10
The best game ever created. Simplicity in movement combined with complexity in strategy and enormous variation are distilled into an elegance no other game so far devised can match. Best to play someone who is similar in skill or it doesn't work. There's a reason this is one of the most widely owned games and it was created over 500 years ago! Get a nice board ... its worth it. Can also be displayed as a piece of art. Some people hate this game because they haven't put in the time to play it competently, but it is worth the time.

I need to get my hands on a cheap set again, one I can keep with the other games, so I can actually play this again. I have a nice marble set (really heavy, down stairs, and too hard to store in the game shelf) and a neat hand-carved Russian travel set (Mom brought back from one of her mission trips).

RATING: 5
Chess and all it's small variants is still game with endless play-ability. I like the fact that the more you play it, the better you can get at it. If you invest time into learning this game you can certainly derive years of enjoyment from participating in pick-up games and tournaments. The problem is that in order for this game to play evenly, you must have players who are at an even skill, knowledge and familiarity level. That can be tough to find outside of tournaments. So, that's what makes this only an occasional game for me. Also, even with the royal war theme it's still very abstract and mathy. I prefer games with more theme and depth in the content.

All-time strategy classic no luck duel between 2 people that still sees the table, just not as much now that I own some other great strategy titles. I learnt this game when I was 5 or 6, it was one of the first 'real' games I was ever taught.

So many different strategies can be chosen it has tons of replay value. I also really enjoy Shogi, Xiang Qi (Chinese chess) and Bughouse for great variants.

To me, this is not a board game; it's a mental sport.  I know that sounds pretentious, but Chess was my first gaming love and a competitive passion throughout my school years. I haven't played much lately (except for the occasional speed chess game online), because I really don't want the intense competition anymore. This makes it difficult for me to rate it objectively.  Chess is justifiably classified as an abstract strategy game; however, the abstractions are directly relevant to concepts of warfare with things like flanks, weak points, inititiative, area control, and superior force (both overall and at the point of attack) all being relevant.  You really can't appreciate these things, though, unless you spend a significant amount of time with the game.  Chess is a jealous mistress like so many of the "lifestyle" games (MtG, D&D, etc.) that are typically shunned here on BGG. But unlike most of these games chess does not need endless variations to keep its hold--all it needs are simple, yet incredibly elegant rules that have been playtested for 400 years or so.

I don't know why but I usually get bored about 20 minutes into a game and start playing super aggressively so the game will end. Plus the fact that if I wanted to get good I'd have to memorize openings, and that's just not interesting to me. It's not really a game you can just pick up and play, there's hundreds of years of overhead to slog through. But apparently if you do it becomes very rewarding, so that's cool I guess.

I like chess.  Every once in awhile I'll play a few games against an AI and I like playing face-to-face... 

On the other hand, the game can be very unforgiving.  When playing people/AI much more skilled, you need to be prepared to get beaten resoundly for the smallest errors.  Each game seems as though both players are on a see-saw: the farther a game starts tipping in one player's favor, the harder it is for the game to tip back... exponentially so. This can make trying to learn how to play better through gameplay extremely frustrating as it's nnot always clear what was done wrong to begin the downfall.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Why do some people think this game is so hard? I know a lot of people who don't know how to play and aren't willing to learn because they think it's too tough. Learning the rules is one thing though, understanding the strategies and complexities is another.  Therein lies my beef, not with the game but with...I dunno, society? Want to get very good very quickly?  Go read a chess strategy book. You'll probably be instantly better than someone who has actually played the game a number of times.

And you can ALWAYS find an opponent, day or night, live or over the &#039;net.  Play it at any level and it&#039;s a load of fun - 10 times the strategy and 10 times the tactics of whatever crap we&#039;re happening to play in our niche hobby that is modern boardgaming ....

I don't know how to rate this. It's a great game, but I really can't play it against too many people--I'm (was) a low-B tournament player. Serious players will own me, but I'll crush any casual player.

With other gamers, I'd really rather be playing something else.

I like to play against Fritz set at the 1650-1700 level, although I win by it making a fairly serious mistake rather than through my accurate play.

Chess is a beautiful game, though my study of it comes in fits and spurts. I like too many games to fully dedicate myself to this one, which is probably what it takes to play at a high level.

Unfortunately I find chess has been so thoroughly analysed it has for many become a game of who can memorise the furthest into a strong opening sequence. In any event, while fairly elegant, chess can be quite dry. The problem with any game where the better player almost always wins is, well, why play? To see who's better at a game? Hmmm.

I enjoy chess but I find that one has to really keep ones hand in to maintain any sort of technical level of expertise in it. Any time I step away from the game for a year or so I notice a distinct drop in my level of play upon returning.

How can chess not be a '10'?  I guess as a cultural artifact, it is.  But I suppose I can't rate it a 10 if I rarely play anymore, can I?  I think the game gets short shrift here as people rush to praise the elegance of 'go.' Chess is amazing in it's own right, and as the all the books and websites attest, it can  provide a lifetime of study.  It can be a fun, quick, "blitz" game of 2 minutes, or a physically draining tournament level game of several hours.

Chess is Beauty. Chess is Art. Chess is a way of life.

There are more books written about Chess than all games combined multiplied by 50. Only the Bible has more written on it then Chess.

More games of chess are played daily then any other games in the world. No other game has household World Champion recognizable names. Fischer, Kasporov, Lasker, Tal etc..

Movies feature chess set prominitely. The Smithsonian has President John Adams chess set on display. Advertisement uses Chess pieces to represent well calculated moves. 

Chess summons up images of suave, sophisticated and brainy.
Everyone dreams to be the World Champion.

Thousands of opening moves. Admittedly only a few hundred are really ever used. What house does not have a chess set sitting around it that is not collecting dust on the pieces or the box that the pieces are sitting in?

"When I speak of the beauty of a game of chess, then naturally this is subjective. Beauty can be found in a very technical, mathematical game for example. That is the beauty of clarity. It is not fireworks and also not a huge achievement of fantasy. Beauty can equally be found in precision. And then there are games, which are perhaps technically imperfect, but the power of imagination in them is full of beauty. I believe every chess player senses beauty, when he succeeds in creating situations, which contradict the expectations and the rules, and he succeeds in mastering this situation. Therein resides the beauty of a spontaneous game strategy, an idea which may be irrational and requires no logic, but is full of power and can be successfully realized." -Kramnik

I recognize Chess' contribution to gaming. I have a fond place for it in my heart, because of my father, and now my youngest son. But, I'm just indifferent to the game itself, I'll play anytime, but I don't love playing, and I don't think/care about how to get better.

RATING: 7
Everybody knows and loves (or hates) chess.  Lack of randomness can lead to repetition, and playing against someone too good or too bad will lead to frustration.  Can spice it up every now and again by placing your pieces randomly (while protecting the king somewhat).

What can I say, it's a requirement of being human to play chess... however it's game has such a steep learning curve for what the attack or defense setup is, I really question whether it's worth playing as a casual game. I greatly enjoy playing with other people who have not studied the game... I love learning more about it and someday may learn the different variances however I just do not feel that the time investment is worth having a game where it's really dependent on your opponent being of equal skill to provide a sufficient challenge or a good game for that matter.

RATING: 10
Chess has it all: a rich history, perfectly balanced mechanics, complete reliance on skill, endless permutations, and accessibility for all ages. It is a truly flawless game that offers a lifetime of challenges, rewards, and enjoyment; and is one of the few games that can rightfully be called an art form.

RATING: 8
Simply an excellent game with huge depth. A classic with a large player base over the whole world. 

Whats keeps me from rating it higher is the immense amount of theoretical study which is required to improve beyond a certain point. You also need to have two reasonably level players to have fun.  

I used to play competitive chess during the late 70:s and have played at least 2000 games, but nowadays only plays occasionally. My most memorable game was on a long train trip in India. After a while we had all passengers as spectators.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Now, I realize that not everyone enjoys such a pure thinking game, but this can't keep me from calling it a perfect game.  100 years from now, people will still be writing books about chess strategy, and people will still be studying games played two hundred years before them.  Every time I play chess, I keep thinking, "What a perfect game this is!"  Of course, I don't mean perfect for every situation--you wouldn't pull out a chessboard when you've got a bunch of friends over for your birthday, after all--but the game itself just can't be improved upon.

Ebony/Stauton style & Tourney set.  I really feel this game should be taught in our school system, K-12th.  It teaches a child to think ahead and consider the consequences of their current position in relation to others... a substantial lesson on life in a kinda-sorta Zen way. 

You can bet that my sons know how to play.

Great two-player abstract; the only reason it doesn't rate higher is the difficulty in finding players of comparable skill, since the game is less fun if you're playing someone noticeably better or worse than you.

RATING: 8
Pretty good, when you play at my level (aka not knowing openings, or really any proper strategy at all). But I've played some people who really know it, and it's not fun. They don't even have fun. They're like people who have memorized all the steps to solve a Rubik's Cube, so the solving/playing is merely a task. I much prefer Xiangqi.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Since I play and practice chess a lot, I probably find it less fun than many good euro games.  Also, the requirement to memorize openings in order to consistently emerge from the opening with an acceptable position is extremely annoying.  However, playing a long time control chess game is extremely rewarding.  The game isn't exactly elegant, but the fact that is complex, and that there are millions of people who play it at all levels, and many, many opportunities to play it face-to-face makes it worth it to study the game, and the more you put in it, the more you get out of it.  I'm sure Go is the same way, but I haven't yet reached the same level of play in Go that I have in chess.  I just wish that everyone would switch to Fischer-Random Chess!

I enjoy Chess quite a bit. The strategies are very deep if you choose to get into them. Why do I score this a 10? It doesn't really have any flaws. It appeals to a very wide age range. You can get more out of it the more you study, but it can be played reasonably well by any logical and perceptive person. It is a bedstone of western gaming culture and desevedly so.

I've been playing this since I was ~10 years old, and still play 25 years later.  Wonderful depth.  I like that you can choose to master it and study openings, historical games, analysis, etc.  OR, if you're time-limited (like me) all you really have to do is know the movement of the pieces, and still have a lot of fun playing.  It all depends on your opponent and what you want out of the game.  I find this game truly beautiful in every way.

Whether or not I play FIDE Chess depends on my mood :-) ...

I haven't played chess for many years and I would only tackle it again if really in the mood.  For two players only.

Predecessor game originated in Gupta India before the 7th Century A.D.  Moved west via Persia and Islamic conquests into Spain, from where it spread into Europe.  Rules standardized when international tournaments became popular after the Staunton design came out in 1849.

This perfect rating isn't coming from the same place as the others, but chess is, to my mind, a perfect game.

It is not something for a gaming night, but I couldn't possibly rate it anything less than 10.

I have a really beautiful set in a handsome box. The board lets it down a bit, but it's still pretty impressive.

Chess is a bit of a Marmite game. I'm reasonably good at it, but I don't like it much, since I was inoculated against it by my father who insisted that I play him night after night after night, and who thrashed me every time we played. He used to play for Cambridge when he was an undergraduate, and was probably close to master level, but he was a terrible teacher. There's no fun in starting a game knowing from before either of you move a pawn that he's going to wipe the floor with you.

I recognise that the game of chess is brilliant, with a huge depth and strategic interest. My ranking is strictly in line with the BGG guidelines, and means "I could be talked into it on occasion". 

But I still like my chess set.

How people can devote their lives to this game is beyond me. Low production values - it really can be played with a couple scraps of paper on a grid - and totally antisocial. The leader always ends up being hammered out of sheer revenge. Plus, I never win. What a piece of shit.

RATING: 7
I understand why this has been the standard for a battle of wits for centuries but it's hard to rank on here.  

In terms of game mechanics even a 10 seems to fall short of measuring the beautiful, elegant simplicity.

However, this is a game where the best player virtually always wins.  Great for showing Chess as an intellectual  measuring stick, not a great thing for people to say about a board game.  

An early disadvantage can be almost impossible to overcome, also not usually considered a plus in the board game world.

I'm just putting a 7 on this one and moving on.

Favorite Variant: Bug House
(a.k.a: Doubles, Doubles Speed, Bunk House, Siamese Chess) 

Two teams of two, each playing their own opponent on a separate board but an opposite color from your partner. When capturing pieces, give them to your partner so that your partner may place that captured piece as their move (Pawns cannot be placed on the first or last rank). If a pawn is promoted, place it on its side and remember it's new role. When one player loses, the team loses. Must be played with chess clocks.

One of those games that you can literally spend your whole life playing and never exhaust the depth.  I played scholastic and tournament chess for many years, and later online correspondence.  I play much less now that I have gotten into modern boardgames, but I am still always down for a game.  Probably not so fun for casual players, but if you can stick with it long enough to get to an intermediate level, there is just so much to explore.  Consider that you can talk about aesthetics and "beauty" regarding a game of chess... and not be talking about the components! lol.

Staring, thinking, staring some more, finally making a tentative move after torturous scanning, evaluating and second-guessing, thinking you've managed to cover all your possible moves and angles, and then -- POW -- your opponent captures your Queen and has you in Check before you can kick back and take a swig of lemonade. Ah yes, much fun.

What can I say? A truly elegent game.For years I stayed away from this game like the plague because of the rather controversial repution it has. At times, when I'm not burned out on it, I really love this game and can play it until  I do get burned out on it- even as lousy as I am. Chess has a problem though and its not a minor one- Any imbalance in player experience will quickly tip the scale in favor of the more experienced player. So it is imperitive that you find a player of same or similar play experience, which isn't always easy and which is why the 6 rating.

Absolutely and without a doubt, this game is on a very very small list of the most incredibly awesome games every invented. I hope that was clear and unambiguous.

But... it really is a different category of "game" altogether from the rest of the games I've rated. It's more like a "mental workout" than something you'd conventionally think of as "fun".

It's also extremely unforgiving, and it only takes a small difference in player skill to make it virtually unwinnable by the weaker player. Meaning that it's hard to find a good match.

Still -- I wish I played this game more.  In the meantime, a great way to scratch the itch is http://chess.emrald.net!

More has been written about chess than any other game. What could I possibly add? But it has to be played over the board, with a human being, not on a computer screen. Also, the difficulty in finding players who aren't radically different in skill (making the game entirely one-sided) keeps it from getting to the table more often. I'd love to give chess a "ten," but in all honesty there are many other games in my collection that are more accessible and more fun to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent mathematical game. Great tension and a lot of frustration.

You come to a point though when it all comes down to analysis and it's still kind of fun, but if you're not willing to dedicate you're whole life to it Chess reach a point of emptiness, because it's just an abstract game with nothing else. Furthermore it's among the most boring games ever, if players aren't on the same level.

So sure, if I once more live close to a friend who loves the game, my rating will probably jump up a notch.

Hated this game as a kid because it always was so much downtime. Started to like it at some point a few years ago, and with the clever expansion "Timer," the downtime/AP-problem was solved, and it has become one of my favorites.

Now this game is the she ite. No Luck, Pure Strategy. What could be wrong with this game. Well, you have to factor in the fact that any one person's chess skill can be anywhere from 0 to 1,000,000. What I'm saying is that some people live, eat, and drink this game. So even though you may beat the crap out of your friends everytime you play them (me) you get your ass handed to you when you play someone who actually knows what they are doing (me playing someone at the local coffee house). Considering the fact that I like a variety when I game, I can't see myself devoting my life to just one game so that in 10 years or so I can actually stand a chance with the experts. Still, this is a great game that deserves a 9/10.

Chess is the undisputed champion among western abstract strategy games.  Yet, after four centuries of play and analysis, I think some of the fun has gone out of it.  However, I imagine that few, if any, of our sophisticated modern games will stand the test of time like chess has.  I am personally burned out on chess, but variations like Knightmare and Fischer random can keep it interesting.  Everyone should learn how to play chess.  Even if it’s not to your taste consider it a history lesson.

If I valued pure design over how much I enjoy playing them, I would have given Chess a 10. This game has kept alive for all this time and acquired so much prestige for a reason.

So, what prevents me from giving this a 10? Chess now is more a sport than a game, which gets us to what, for me, kills the fun from it: it has been overstudied. That creates a lot of imbalance in between players with different skill levels, as well as reducing creative play a lot. I enjoy playing with people of my level, but that's a rare occurrence.

Fun fact: I do enjoy Go quite a lot, despite having the same drawback as Chess. Maybe because it isn't so widespread, as I have an easier time finding players of my level. Who knows...

Chess has evolved during 100s of years into its current form. The theme has some nice medieval touch to it, kings sit next to their queens, the queens are much more powerful than their spouse, normal pawns can promote in their life if they survive and progress.

Chess is language independent, it is part of international culture, like soccer: if you are in a pub in, say, Bali, you can quickly break the ice with the locals by inviting them to play a game of chess. That alone is a reason to at least know how to play it, and it requires no wifi. 

The interesting thing is that no piece is safe, only the position of a piece is safe if it is reached by more of your other pieces than of the opponent's pieces. With players of about equal strenght it is a very tight game.

However:
-1 too contrived rules: en passent, promotion
-1  no obligation to slay a piece.
-1 too often the end result is a draw for a game of no chance which feels like a bummer if you were obviously better but could't win.
-1 a better player always wins and there is no handicap option
-1 to progress beyond some basic level you need to learn a whole bunch of opening theory
-1 can take hours and nothing to do, too much downtime.

While I beat pretty much anyone I ever play chess with, I know I'm really not that good at it. That is, if I played this in a park or on a campus with some stranger, I'd probably get my butt handed to me. While I love chess, I just don't think it's that good of a game due to skill being so important. I love that the skill can really show you who is truly better at it, but at the same time it's just not that fun when you know that it's probably not going to be much of a contest, that either you or them probably has no shot.

My first boardgame. I think it's easy to undermine how accessible this game is. I see people playing it in the bookstore, at the Starbucks. And I always play.

Tempting though it is to give Chess a 10 (after all, I will always want to play it in the future, etc.), there are times when I'm simply not in the mood, etc. But I would also not simply call it a 'Very good game', so I'm unsure what rating to give it...

Chess for me is just too abstract.  The interaction of the pieces alone no longer pulls me in.  Some simulation aspect would help, but chess simulates nothing including medieval warfare.  Chess is in fact an Nth generation mutation of chaturanga, an abstract Indian boardgame simulating ancient Indian warfare.  But objectively, chess still possesses merit.  Chess has elegant enough rules and skill alone determines the victor.

Chess is a two-player, abstract strategy board game that represents medieval warfare on an 8x8 board with alternating light and dark squares. Opposing pieces, traditionally designated White and Black, are initially lined up on either side. Each type of piece has a unique form of movement and capturing occurs when a piece, via its movement, occupies the square of an opposing piece. Players take turns moving one of their pieces in an attempt to capture, attack, defend, or develop their positions. Chess games can end in checkmate, resignation, or one of several types of draws. Chess is one of the most popular games in the world, played by millions of people worldwide at home, in clubs, online, by correspondence, and in tournaments. Between two highly skilled players, chess can be a beautiful thing to watch, and a game can provide great entertainment even for novices. There is also a large literature of books and periodicals about chess, typicially featuring games and commentary by chess masters.

I learned chess somewhat late - at 14.  But at various points in my life it was an obsession.  I found, however, that once I'd discovered war games, with colorful maps and the variety of pieces, chess kind of paled.  Apart from that, it still may be the nearly-perfect game.  I've played Chinese chess (xiang qi) as well, but find the old classic has much more depth AND breadth.

I enjoy Chess, it is a fun game that most everyone knows how to play. Teaching others is a breeze, though (perhaps obviosuly) mastering the game could take a lifetime. 

I'm not a very good chess player, though I'm usually up for a game if someone suggests it. 

I built my own chessboard while in highschool from walnut and oak.

Rated a 7 only because there are other games i'd rather play. Chess is probably one of the few games that is perfect - in terms of gameplay and mechanics i'd rate it a 10.

Not my favourite game. I suspect because it feels too calculable, or because my brain approaches it in that way.

Perhaps at a high level the rote elements are less significant, but as a novice they are a turnoff and make it feel more like a system puzzle, and less about the expression of the other player.

Decent strategy game; however, I refuse to memorize opening, mid-game, or end-game moves.

You can't ignore Chess' standing as the central serious game in Western history.  But the only time I can really enjoy the game is when I am playing against an evenly-matched opponent, e.g. one who rarely plays and has no understanding of anything but the most basic strategies.  In other words, I almost never play.

I would recommend that people who like Chess play The Duke.  It has a lot of a similar feel and strategy, but with a lot more variety, not only in not having the same openings every game, but especially in all the different pieces, and you never know which ones you'll get in any given game.  

And the whole thing of each piece having two moving patterns that you alternate through is just so neat.

And the tension of when to bring in new pieces and when to move.

AND the neat powers that some units have, like fear or dread.

AND!! the different ways to play with the mountain or the dragon or the flag.  So it basically just takes some of the core concepts of chess and adds so much more.

So it's not that chess is a really bad game, but I think its experience is only good in a couple areas and other games have added so much to what you can experience in a 2-player abstract strategy game with move-and-capture mechanics.

There is no other boardgame which has had such an impact on culture (or on other boardgames) as chess. If it was designed today it would probably look very different and would be a small niche game but thankfully it wasn't and just a quick trip to the British Museum (if you are in London) to see the Lewis Chessmen shows the games importance.

Games between players of equal skill are great and games at the highest level are things of beauty.  well worth reading the annotations of the greatest games to see how the best of the best can take a simple game to the highest places.

Besides, I think [GAMEID=12040] or [GAMEID=86997] are far superior examples of the 'old game'.

We once had a chess tournament at my school. In my first match I was drawn against a kid who played chess for Kent, his county. I took 5 minutes per move. He took 5 seconds. He knew the best moves because he had studied chess as if it were an acadmenic subject. I hate chess because of the sort of people who are good at it.

I've been playing this game for over 20 years, and still play it a LOT online.  Mostly Turn-based chess on GameKnot, but I also log onto FICS once in a while for real-time play.  Luckily I'm good enough not to be able to play reasonably sensible games most of the time (my rating fluctuates between 1450 and 1525 on both servers).  Unfortunately I don't get to play it FtF very much any more.

EDIT: hard as it is for me to believe, chess has essentially been supplanted by YINSH and GIPF. My online play has tapered off to nothing, and I still haven't played face-to-face lately. Technically, i think I would now have to rate this a 7, but my long, and engaging history with the game makes that feel wrong, so I'll just drop it to a 9 for now.  I may start up some new games on GameKnot soon, too.

I do not like games that can be calculated completely so much. I like my chess board though - very nice looking wooden pieces. I created a chess program some time ago - that was more fun than to actually play it. I think for me the game is too abstract maybe.

RATING: 6
Go is simply more fun because of the ready made handicap. I either crush people and they don't understand why, or I get crushed and I don't understand why.  Queen side openings are the most fun (why not try to get the board as messy and complicated as possible?!).

Rated by the kids (ages 6 & 9). Their comment: We love chess! It's super skilled. Tons of strategy. We'd rather play it than checkers any day. We love learning the different ways the pieces move and all the optimal moves to crush our parents who aren't really into it! Ha ha ha ;)

Perfect example of one of the many things terribly wrong with BGG. There is no reason on this Earth that CHESS should be ranked this poorly. It's absurd.

Chess is probably the first game I can remember playing or wanting to play. I used to enjoy playing this game, but it ceased to be fun when I realized how much you must study this game in order to be any good. It feels more like exercise than a gaming experience.

That being said, it is probably the best game I've ever played. It is very pure. No luck, no fiddly mechanics or scoring, just your army verse an equal army. No game has been studied more or had more written about it. It is perfect and has been for centuries. Trying to improve this game is an exercise in futilty.

The original, and still the BEST board based wargame. Why? The simplicity, portability, and the universal appeal make this game a perfect starting point for any serious gamer. After checkers how else would you learn the basics of strategy. The geometry is elegant and the game lends itself to nearly endles exotic artwork for the pieces. Top players are still beating computers, but that won't last long... heh heh! See YOU on the board!

I would probably rate this game higher, but I just get so frustrated .. and not because of the other player, but because of myself !
It takes me forever to make a move, and I am usually the one that drags the game on for hours, with no end in sight. Because of this, I am usually left disappointed about the game, and that is why I usually dont like playing the game.
But dont get me wrong, the game mechanics and skill necessary to play this game are very high. But you must usually have tremendous patience when playing.

I do believe my love towards board games started with chess. For couple of years, I was all into chess - chess seminars, various literatures, even local tournaments... and then realisation dawned.

I suck at chess. 

That being said, the rating I gave it only reflects the fact I'm not playing it much lately... by lately, I mean past 5 years. However, there are moments I'll gladly accept a match. And probably lose. :)

In my opinion, the most perfect board game ever made.

Outrage!  How could I possibly give a "6" to a super classic, a game that has withstood the test of time and inspired million of players around the world?  Well, this is a subjective rating base on the BGG scale, how likely I am to play this game again.  The rating for the game itself should probably be a 8 or 9 based merely on uniqueness, mechanics, challenge, and widespread adoption.  However, this is a game where knowledge, practice, the ability to plan in advance and to compute possible outcomes is so important that a beginner does not stand a chance against a master.  I am not interested in mastering such a game, therefore I will use the BGG score and correctly point out that it's a personal 6.

I have never won a game of chess, ever. Yet, I could write an entire treatise on it. On the only 2 demographics I've ever seen play it: big brain snobs (occasionally) and big brain trailer trash (often). On the chicken/egg conundrum: do I hate it because I lose, or do I lose because I hate it? 3 because I won't ever play it unless thoroughly goaded into it.

06/06 - Damn, my 5 year old nephew is really really into chess now. This means I get sucked into games. It's more fun playing with him because we're doing something together, and we're about the same level ;-). Well, just about. He beats me every time.

Dude, it's chess. Currently I'm about 1500 or 1600 now but I'm preferring Knightmare/Rogue/Moab Chess (with portals/wrap-arounds/fairy pieces) than orthodox chess. I'm pretty much done with folks that have memorized openings. I did that for a while, memorizing a dozen or so openings with variations...no more. Yeah, it's traditional and all that but it's boring and favors memory over tactics and strategy. I don't read the same kind of books endlessly why would I play the same kind of chess. Check out the Chess Variants page on Wikipedia for cool alternatives.

RATING: 7
I was press-ganged into coaching a school chess club. In that context, I've loved this game. Kids haven't memorized much, their play is full of exploration and discovery, and their games don't take too long.

Outside of chess club, I used to play a few moves a day or short variants. Single-session face-to-face games aren't that fun for me anymore. The mix of chess culture and my obsessive nature turned that from play into work.

Introduce someone who finds Chess too serious or long to a small board, no-setup variant, like [gameid=66283] or Knizia's [gameid=40375]. For a social game, try [gameid=14188]. I enjoy a quick fix of [url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minichess]Minichess[/url] variants.

There are few – maybe no other – games that could meet this tense feeling of a battle between two minds. I love it.
 
Unfortunately I think the game is somewhat destroyed by all the books. If you play on a club, you're not really playing your opponent – you're playing the brilliant people who came up with those openings, computer calculations, etc.

And personally I don't see how people think it's a lot of fun to study openings, execute them and win because of that. Good job sir, you we're able to memorize your homework!

I've probably been playing chess longer than any other game I own. It has brought me hours of pleasure. On the other hand, I rarely find myself wanting to play, for a couple of reasons.

First, it is not really all that fun. It is very challenging and mentally stimulating, but I've come to look for fun in my games of late. Chess doesn't really pass muster in this arena.

Second, it is very hard to find someone to play with that has roughly the same skill level. My playing companions are either better or worse than I. Neither situation works out that well. Chess is a game that is best enjoyed with someone with roughly the same skill level.

Come on - it's chess - one of the best games of all time throughout history.  IMO the best strategy game of all time. A game with 0% chance and all strategy and skill?  Pretty awesome.  How many more 0% chance games can you name?  Chess is the Daddy of them all. As a kid I used to read chess books - that's how much of a dork I am.  Sadly despite all my studies I'm still a mediocre chess player.  In another life I'd be Bobby Fisher - to be a chess master is a dream/fantasy of mine - to dominate and have it be that easy - planning 10+moves in advance in your head - it's unimaginable but envious to me.

Won't play chess anymore, too abstract and not fun and need to know the standards tactics and opening to really enjoys the game.
I like game where you can come with your own strategies, unfortunalty chess is not like that anymore, it's a game where the best player is the one that know all the chess opening, counter and other chess facts from published Chess info.  That game is so overrated.

The Immortal Game. By far, it's the greatest ever.

It doesn't fit in with and can't really be compared to the majority of the games on this site.

It has it's own army of websites and libraries of books. Puerto Rico doesn't.

RATING: 8.3
I grew playing chess and I absolutely love it.

It is hard to bring it to the table, as most people think it is too hard to learn and feel overwhelmed before even touching a chessman.

And it is, in a way, hard to learn, but mostly because people don't really want to learn it.

Also, when the players' skills are not about even, the fun gets compromised. When the weaker player is not interested in improving her skills on after-play analysis it gets even more compromised.

It is a pity that most people don't see the its beauty just because they feel scared by its depth.

RATING: 6
Good game for 'casual' all the way to 'very serious' people/settings. Ubiquitous, comes in a vast variety of sizes, materials, styles, and price ranges. Strategically complex, but not overly so.

Still, I find it being overshadowed more and more by abstract games such as Go and Arimaa as I age and play more games. However, I've found ways to extend the longevity of chess, by using the components as (or supplementing them with) esoteric game design tools. 
For starters, chess variants are easy to invent. The 6 unit types can be drawn on blank dice to randomly decide the army each player gets. 
A game I've seen but don't have, Chesstique, does something similar to this, except I think it only has certain units on each die and lets you choose the unit.
The implications of these simple mechanical changes are only the tip of the iceberg.

As for vanilla chess: It's something I'll play with a friend. I guess it's a game I only want when either experimenting or when in the company of someone I'd play anything with. Playing chess in a casual or 'speed' fashion definitely feels less taxing than trying to do the same with Go or Arimaa. There are very few questions in chess to resolve, mostly just castling. 

I suppose chess feels just like what it is: a strategic skirmish game with a hint of territory control to it. I like depth to my units and to their interactivity, and this means more than just changing the shape of the patterns in which they can move. Still, chess fills a niche nothing else can ever quite dislodge it from.

I feel that chess often gets a bad rap.  We look at what the best players need to do to become good, and then feel we can never do that, so we abandon the game.  This ignores the fact that chess (And its relatives) can be a fun game without tremendous study or dedication.  If you can find some players of relatively equal strength, just play and don't worry about the rest.

Rating based on 2 players.

This is a good example of my ratings being a reflection more about how much I want to play a game than the quality of the game, perse; I recognize the elegance, the in-depth strategy, the aesthetic purity of chess... and yet I don't like playing it at all. Chess is one of the very few turn-based games that really stresses me out to play. I think much of that is that it boils down to a perfect-information game that is purely attritional where it's possible to lose in two moves--I feel like I'm in constant "sudden death" mode. And yes, I'm horrible at it too!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Its a classic and its fun, but its not a very good game for interacting with others because I'm too busy trying to plot my next move.  I'm more of a social gamer, so this isn't really up my alley.

I was pretty obsessed with Chess from ages 8-16 or so, was a decent club player (~1500 elo), did some minor tournaments, etc.

Chess is great in terms of tactical problems and thinking. But as I played more and more, the following things started to bother me:
1) At some point, you really need to memorize openings. Otherwise, despite reading ability, you will get trounced. I found this part tedious.
2) Draws are frequent, and wins are often small (e.g. managing to gain one pawn advantage, and protecting it until the endgame).
3) No handicap system, so to play interesting games you need to find players close to your skill level. This is easy enough online, but considerably harder if you want to play in person.
4) This is minor, but from an aesthetic point of view some of the rules seem odd/arbitrary (e.g. pawn en passant is capturing a piece and not moving where it was located; castling has 2 pieces moving simultaneously, and the possibility depends on both their movement history and whether intermediate squares are attacked).

So not a game I play much nowadays, but definitely a game I think people should learn/play for a while.

I don't know Chinese and Japanese chess well enough to compare (only played them a couple times).

Lovely abstract that somehow looks magnificent even when played with cheap plastic pieces. Has an almost unbeatable cerebral (as opposed to geek) reputation.

It is Chess, the most aggressively anti-social game of all time. Players routinely mistake aptitude and experience for intelligence or wit.

It is fun with the right partner; true expertise requires thousands of hours a year and many years of training, including considerable rote memorization of openings and positions.

It is not actually balanced (white has a notable statistical advantage), and it is far too prone to draws.

The expansions are also a letdown.

The truth is that I love chess, and always have, but there are two camps that almost every chess player will fall into: The noob who has no idea about strategy and the pro who has memorized openings and takes the game altogether too seriously. I myself fall sort of into the latter camp, but then I reflect on it and realize that that's not what a game is supposed to be like. I'll gladly play it any time, but I think other 2-player abstracts need to get more love.

Though it's quite probable no one will ever read this, I need to add that various aspects of chess (particularly in the endgame, but sometimes throughout) encourage the most despicable aspects of human nature (sneaking around, squirming, pathetically hiding and hoping that the other guy will make the first mistake so you can pounce...). Even if I win against such a person, I despise the game for days thereafter and don't even want to look at it. It disgusts me that people play like that, but the game honestly rewards it most of the time.

It's maybe the first boardgame I ever played that made me realize there is more to gaming than just having fun. Chess mirrored my mind, my fears, my anxiety, my laziness to think, sometimes my desire to go cheaply and setup a trap instead of winning honestly.

RATING: 10
The perfect game.  There's a reason it's lasted centuries.  As much a game about psychology as it is about tactics and strategy.  Knowing your opponent, predicting how he/she will react to your moves and how to trick them is essential.

En passant is still stupid, though.  :)

RATING: N/A
Generic game, like Tactics II or Blitzkrieg, but with less terrain differentiation. Much more unit-type differentiation than most wargames, with unique movement and combat systems. There is no stacking, even during movement (with an exception wrt Knights). The CRT is very unusual, strongly favors the attacker, and strongly favors counterattack-based defenses. There is only one result, DE, and it occurs regardless of the odds ratio or the die roll. It can have very subtle strategies, but it has none of the history I look for in a game.

I learned the game when I was 10 and played it during high school lunch hours in Grades 10 and 11. I own a very nice chess set: not a wooden board or anything like that, but a "Chess Tube", which has the same high-quality plastic pieces I used in high school along with a roll-up board. 

I lucked out and defeated the president of the Victoria Chess Club when I was about 21 or 22 years old, but I'm not sure if I ever played the game after that time. I got really interested in the game but gave up. Would never go back--simply too much memorization and being quiet. Never tried speed chess.

Good abstract strategy game, but for this category there are too many different pieces which cause many opportunities and too much thinking about the next move. An abstract strategy should have less different pieces such as Dvonn or GO.

For a couple of years, I had the project of playing online chess with someone from every country in the world.  I got about 65% of the way there.  I never got even a little bit better at chess.  It is a flawed game, to my way of thinking, in that to be good at it you have to do a lot of the type of memorizing that makes a game more like work than fun.

Each week, on friday afternoon, I play chess with my 6th grade students.  I did and still do this for the last 10 years.  In this lapse of time, I came to realise that chess is more than a game, it's an history book waiting to be explained.  I still find opponent more than worthy enough, even though they are young.  I've been handed my ass over more than once in this time.  I am so proud when it happens.

Being responsible for the yearly chess tournament in my school, I love to see students progressing.  Chess is all about logic.  I hearthily suggest it to parents with their kids.

I played a lot of Chess when I was younger, but gave up when I reached my teens. By the time I returned to it, everyone I played was far more accomplished than me. It doesn't help that my attention span has suffered. I've tried to get back into it a few times, but I just get bored halfway through a game, so I've decided to let it go gracefully. It's not like the Chess world will be impoverished by my absence.

Funky Stratego variant where you play with open pieces on a smaller, checkered board. I've rated it from 3 to 9 and back over the times, based mainly on the opponents available at the time. As my elder son gets better and better with it, I like it very much nowadays.

RATING: 10
The best strategic and tactical game in existence for centuries.  As gamers we owe it a great debt.  It was the first really serious game I ever played and I went on to become a rated tournament chess player.  Sadly its days became numbered a computer finally beat the world champion, but it's still a great game.  One of the few abstract games that I like.  It's a very, very deep game that at its best creates a link between the two player's minds unlike anything I've ever experienced.

RATING: 10
The most exciting board game ever invented. Comments like 'the game will be solved by computers in x years' are really silly, since the game is really a battle of the minds; it's a fight between two players, not a bunch of scripted moves. The aspect of the game which really sets it apart for me is that the great games played throughout history are immortal works of art to those who understand the game. I've probably played many thousands of games, and whenever I play an equal or better opponent I never fail to get surprised, even when I seem to have everything well in hand. A beautiful and mysterious game.

RATING: 5
I rather like Chess. Im not a complete beginner but not remotely any good (I recon I could maybe hope to hold a 1200-1300 rating at this point in time but I might be deluding myself), and since I'm not about to join a club I just have online or AI as the only places for me to find opponents at the same level. I could choose differently of course, but I don't feel that much of a draw to play more.

My interest in Chess has also been superseded by Go, which I feel offers a more "organic" quality to the game and the exploration of the underlying framework - it's a game I more often get the "Oh, so that's how it is!" discoveries during play. The ability to handicap myself or my opponent means that it's easier to play anyone - regardless of experience! So ye, that leaves Chess to the point where I play the occasional game online or against an AI - or just do tactical puzzles.

Difficult to rate this one. There are plenty of other games I'd rather play, but they're not necessarily better.

A very deep game that I only enjoy about a quarter of the time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4.5
Game in a Nutshell: Attempt to capture the opponent's king by using the individual qualities of different pieces.  

Two-player only.

Pros: Apparently it can't be solved if humans can beat computers at it, so it's definitely not broken.

Cons: It's not a game, it's a lifestyle. And that's how it feels: In the chess world, if you're a loser you're less of a person. If you don't want to buck-up and learn the game, it's like the regulars think you're running from life, rather then just deciding you don't like to play. It's the culture around chess that really brings this game down... not that it's all that fun in the first place.

Other: I can think of plenty of other abstract games that feel easier to pick up on and enjoy even while still getting my butt kicked by someone more experienced. Most namely: Changgi.

Best Use: Gives the 'intellectual' crowd something to make them feel good about themselves.

After a few hundred plays. Classic and very fun to play, but takes a points hit for having what today would be considered serious design flaws.  Very high draw rates among skilled players, kludgy rules to prevent infinite cycles, too easy to tabulate opening libraries, etc.

RATING: 9
How can this not be rated higher?  This game has been played more than just about any other. It's one of a handful of games that has it's own literature, which can be quite satisfying.  It admits a wide variety of playing styles and situations.  Surprising and beautiful moves are quite common -- how often are you truly surprised by a player's move in a Eurogame?

A lot of people resent all the chess theory, but that is only an issue if you want to play in tournaments.  You can still have fun without a rating.

A pretty good game that I simply have limited patience for. Admirable for its elegance and replayability, it also is supremely frustrating. Although in some ways it does model elements of pre-gunpower combat, it is too abstract for my tastes. I agonize over every move, so much so that other people have thrown up their arms and quit. I can't understand the people who devote their lives to this game. It's just a game. I downgraded to a 5 because I simply cannot imagine wanting to play this, except solo against the computer to kill a little time. This has the added advantage that I can accuse my "opponent" of cheating and quit midway without guilt. You know, just for fun.

Chess is a great game. It took me many years of solid play to really come to appreciate it for all it is. One of the heavier games in existence, new players are put off by it, and, to be honest, don't stand a chance against an experienced player. Overall, cheap to own, play, and has great re-play value. Plus, there are a million places to play on-line. My favorite is http://playchess.com.

Timeless game that is so widely played it does well to at least know the basics of the game. A game that I play casually and play better than the average person.

But do I actually play the game?  Almost never.  I've taught it to my girls, but they do not have the patience or time to put into learning its intricacies.  Heck, I don't either.  And yet, I'm still pulled toward this classic game.

The game of kings and the best boardgame ever made. There is no luck or coincidence, just pure skill and good/bad decisions, for this reason its also one of the only truly competitive games. It's one of the deepest games in existence, you could spend a life trying to master chess and by then you would still have things to learn. The replayability is off the chart with almost infinitely different positions.

The only bad thing I can say about this game is that because chess is a skill game it requires the players to be somewhere equal in strenght.

Well.. a classic. Only problem is that there's no limit to how much this game can be studied making experienced players much better than novices and taking the fun out of the game. (coming from someone who thinks it's no fun to beat beginners and no fun to get beaten by chess-gurus)

You can always get better and learn new things in chess. There is no one strategy to win. You can always get better. This game is unlike any other game, you can play it thousands of times and still learn new stuff. It clearly is the best 1 vs 1 game. No luck involved, only skills.

While chess may not be an all time favorite for me, it certainly deserves some respect.  Combine that with the fact that you can make a set for nothing and play over 100 games with it, hard to deny its value.  Plus, I can admire a game that people literally devote their lives to.

How do you rate a classic, a revolutionary concept, a (pardon-the-pun) gamechanger? It's tough, you'd like to see it be high, yet sadly 6 is all I can muster because I rank based on how frequently I want to play a game, and 5.5 about sums it up.

It certainly belongs in the hall of fame, but in today's era, there's simply better/fun games.

I remember winning the 3rd Grade Chess Championship.  My prize? Mickey Mouse glow-in-the-dark calendar, how cool was that?  Also remember in 5th grade going to a chess club and our teacher was from India.  Each week one of us got to play him.  I beat him and he kept asking how I did it and what book I read.  I've never read a chess book nor do I ever intend to.  Chess is just a fun game for me. Then I came in the top 10 in elementary school in 5th grade. The championship was organized by the librabrian a big chess nut.  She had a live size board with students dressed up to move as the two battled it out.  Oh yes, I really suck at playing since it's been awhile since I've played.  Come on elementary students...game on.  I'll play a game of chess with ya!

An obvious classic that I love.  I think the game itself is a little lacking, since the piece movement is not particularly simple.  The complexity is what makes it great, but the strict opening is a deterrent for me.  To get better at Chess you have to study Chess and the knowledge will only help you at Chess.  Chess960 sounds like an interesting solution to the opening book problem, but I have not tried it yet.

I played fanatically between the ages of about 8 and 18, and got up to county standard.  I found that at the level where I was getting a decent game, I usually ended with about 15 minutes on my clock and around 90 minutes on my opponent's clock = around 75 minutes of boredom.  At that point, I switched to bridge and RPGs, until I eventuallly discovered European games.

I still play casually*, usually at 5 minutes a game, but the best use of a chess set is to play Alice Chess or Progressive Chess; or with two chess sets, Bughouse.  

*Colliers Wood chess club, Donald Hope Library, Saturdays, 2pm (ish)-5pm.
I also play via Chesspresso (turn-based android app) - challenge mrraow.

Chess is probably what got me hooked on abstracts in the first place and the way of thinking that I learned playing chess has made it easier for me to pick up strategies in just about every other game I've played since, but if I saw it for the first time now, I'd be sadly disappointed.  If you're thinking of taking up a traditional board game, go wipes the floor with chess.  Using Chinese scoring at least, go feels like it was designed; nice simple logical rules which make the rules of chess look very clumsy by comparison.

Oh, yes, I've invented a few chess variants.  Some are in David Pritchard's encyclopedia of chess variants, a couple of others are here: http://www.scat.demon.co.uk/free.html#chess - Quantum Chess is the only one that bears repeated play.

I'd avoided this game since getting into "modern" board games a few years ago. Chess just seemed old-fashioned and boring given all the new stuff I was experiencing. The few face-to-face games I played since getting into the BGG craze only confirmed this impression.

However, I recently started playing this again on the iPad and on my phone, and I'm completely hooked. This used to be my go-to game, and I've been sucked in again. I realize that many of the new games I like most share similarities with Chess. There remain some things I don't like, which could result in another dry spell someday, but there's so much "depth" here that I know I'll still be playing this decades from now.

Update: Yup, another dry spell for sure. It's just not "exciting" enough to get into unless I'm already into it. I force myself to play for the 10x10 Challenge and always enjoy it, but it takes a few plays to get back in the groove. I'm docking the rating a point for now, but I can see it going back up if I start playing it all the time on my phone or something.

I was on a chess team in elementary school. A classic i played with my Dad. He was a queen dominate player, which made me a defensive/trade friendly player.

I hope they solve it soon.  Then hopefully it will be viewed as a silly game instead of some kind of massive achievement.

Do modern board games have the same amount of possible moves & strategies? Could they possible be able symbolize the whole of life like Chess does? I find it hard to imagine, but who knows. The former, maybe, it is "just" an abstract, after all. The latter, no. Maybe Go? Oh wait, that's not modern... 

Of course, to grossly simplify, culturally Go is for Asian cultures what Chess is to the Occident. Anyway, I still find it funny how people say there are dozens of better abstracts than Chess or Go, as this simply is not the case. Yes, these bad boys have got some insane history and cultural sediments under their belts, so I guess the comparison is quite unfair. But such is life.

Do I play Chess? Not really, no. But I do like to read about it occasionally. Does it rock hard? Oh my summer children, it surely does.

My love for this game is not describable, nor reasonable, nor healthy or free from frustration. It is a mix of a multitude of things.

The old heritage, the worldwide spread, the timeless quality, the abstract factor, the creativity. Those are only a few of the aspects that make chess a great game. For most people it is a game that will forever have secrets, something that can accompany them for a lifetime. 

It can be played for fun, competitively, it can be studied, it can make you both sad and happy. Let's not forget, however, that it is still just a game. But what a great one.

I played avidly in elementary and middle school, and though I was no longer the top of the heap in high school I still played quite a bit there as well.  However, I got somewhat discouraged in college (it seemed like I would've been near the bottom of the chess club ladder there) and between that and other interests I haven't played much recently (though I do follow chess news to some extent).

Still, very engaging game when one's opponent is of roughly the same skill, and a recent enjoyable game reminded me why I like it.  I don't know that I'll be suggesting it much more in the future (there are still numerous other two-player games I'd like to play more), but if challenged I probably won't decline.

RATING: 6
I have devoted a fair bit of time to Chess, and think it can be a beautiful game. But it is dry, and rarely do you find that between friends you have an even match - one nearly always has studied more than the other. For me this makes Euro playing more fun.
Still play occasionally, with a workmate or the kids. 
Honestly though, having played so many games, I'd (nearly) always want to play something else. Beautiful, but leave it to the devoted.

Do I love this game?  Yes.  Am I particularly good at it?  Heck no!  Do I care?  Not really.  I quite happily play and get thrashed ... even by small children!

Ahhh, chess.  I know I'm not that good at it, and forget playing online, that's a joke.  I brought this to work and we used to play a lot.  Biggest problem is I always win.  I think in 50+ games, I've only lost 3 times.  I know the people I play with are just not that good, because I'm really not that good.  I had to bring it home because it made for a long afternoon at work.  It's amazing how pissy someone gets after losing 50 times in a row!!!! OUCH!

RATING: 2
Rating this according to the BGG rating guide:
This game is very annoying and I have no inclination to actually sit down and play this. I actually don't mind abstracts. I think games like YINSH and some of the "semi-abstract" Euros like T&E or El Grande are excellent games...but Chess just leaves me worse than cold...I really don't have any inclination to study the game or even casually sit down and push the pieces around. The game just has no draw for me although it is obviously one of the deepest and most thoughtful games around.

A classic game of strategy and tactics which is best played between players of equal strength. The team player version "chock", where the team members play different colors and may give each other the pieces they take to add instead of a normal move, is also recommended.

RATING: 5
A holy cow often backed by arguments in the vein of "it's been a worldwide activity since before my birth and still exists". Coming from a community who poops on Monopoly at every occasion, we should know better than defending the mainstream consensus. Many of us probably picked up Chess as kids, like religion or football, and ourselves taking a critical look at it may be part of an identity crisis we'd rather not have.

The main problem with Chess is once you've tackled its basics and are able to set up forks and stuff, memorising hundreds of openings will be more efficient than any other path of progression. High level play, where creativity seems to take place again, isn't better since it results in 60% draws, which no modern competitive game would be proud of.

The good news is that if you own a chess set, you can now play Arimaa. Seriously, give it a try.

Tout a été dit sur le roi des jeux! Un grand classique et un classique qui le restera. Je connais peu de gens qui ne possède pas un jeu d'échecs à la maison. Personnellement, ce fût le premier jeu auquel je me suis adonné (à l'âge de 4 ans) et je sais que ce jeu m'accompagnera sur mon lit de mort!

Deux joueurs. Deux acteurs. Une scène. Et l'histoire se crée un coup à la fois.

Dans tous les pays que j'ai visités, j'ai toujours fini par croiser des gens qui jouaient aux échecs dans un parc, et à chaque fois, j'ai immédiatement éprouvé le sentiment que ces joueurs et moi faisions partie de la même grande famille.

Et chaque fois que je vois un jeu d'échecs, mon regard est immédiatement captivé, et je ne peux qu'admirer l'harmonie initiale de la position, qui cache pourtant un potentiel d'une si grande violence!

Être assis et jouer une partie pendant quatre, cinq, six heures, c'est accepter de souffrir. Mais ne dit-on pas qu'aimer, c'est souffrir!?...

After a decade or two of stuffing around and not really 'getting' chess, I've recently started to play against friends online, which has re-ignited my interest (and encouraged me to drag out the rather more aesthetically pleasing physical chess set).

Chess is one of the classic games - to play properly requires 2 1/2 hrs of time on each clock.  When I was 15 years old, I got a rating of 1700 in Canada, played tournaments in Hong Kong beating a couple of 1900 rated players. My great "accomplishment" was drawing the grandmaster Najdorf when he was playing 40 players simultaneously in Hong Kong in 1986, and I was only one of two people to draw him. Unfortunately, I haven't raised a chess piece in anger for many years. I have only played the odd social game with co-workers, but haven't played blitz or anything that sharpens my skill. My skills have declined to the point where I easily blunder away pieces now. Chess will always be one of my favorite games, but I don't think I could find the time to play tournament matches again.

Chess is exceedingly unforgiving of mismatches - a game that's only interesting or fun when your opponent plays about your level.  I probably don't enjoy the game because I just can't take it seriously enough to need the win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Rating applies when opponents are well matched, falls rapidly if one is significantly weaker than the other.

As a game though; over five hundred years of investigation and it is still going strong! Computers have only enhanced the face to face game, and the world's strongest players are getting younger and younger...

Maybe more of a Mind Sport than a game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good game, usually enjoy playing it, but as a casual player it takes a little too much energy to get into. Mostly the problem I've found is that my opponents generally lose interest or concentration by about half way through the game, which tends to make the end-game a bit unsatisfying.

I guess this is a game where you really need to play someone close in level to yourself for it to be interesting.

Fun game that I quite loved as a child. Now that I've discovered designer games, I find that I wish Chess had more theme/variability. I've looked up variants like Different Dimension Chess (where you set up two boards and after a piece moves, it teleports to the other board) and the random start setup Chess, but I still don't like that there can such a huge gap in skill between players. I suppose thats good, but I think this is only really, really fun with someone at your skill level. If its someone too weak or too strong...its not as fun as modern designer games.

Fun fact: Ive played a master before (it was 30 of us against her), and Ive also won a chess tournament before. These are memories from my HS chess club. I also beat my school's first board relatively consistently (I always held second board position but got better that I eventually beat him even when I would lose a rook in the beginning) and beat my chess teacher in a 3 hour long game before graduating, so I'm decently proud of myself for that.

Plays: 30-50+?

I was on my HS chess team and playing online is fun. One of the greatest abstract game ever, I'm pretty rusty and usually just play the computer nowadays. 

The problem with chess is that both players sit in absolute silence the entire game. I prefer chess variants like bughouse (which is a team game).

RATING: 7
The emperor of abstracts. Well, there's no much rest for the weary: This classical brainburner never seizes to pour gazoline onto my brains and willingly provides a match. It feels more like work (in a see-through cube set up by Mensa, on a sunday) than play. 60 minutes? Lies, lies and statistics... But Chess' importance for, wait for the melodramatic insert...[b]*mankind*[/b], cannot be underestimated. An how many board games have a musical to their name? Not Puerto Rico, that's for sure (all it has to its name is a small role in West Side Story). Or can be played with supersized pieces in parks, against hobos who'll probably beat you? Not Caylus, that's for sure. Additionally, Chess is one of the few games that have a global meaning well beyond the gaming realm. Damn you Bobby Fischer! But hey, lest us not forget what comes with the game: few games can display so many annoying child prodigies (with even more annoying parents en entourage) and eccentric nutcases in tournaments: -1 point, but an extra point for never giving birth to a single expansion during its 2000 years rule. I'm probably wrong, but I don't want to know.

Late game Chess is very thinky, especially when it comes to the worth of pieces, trades and positioning.

Chess is simply the king of all games. I mean it's such a simple game yet it's extremely strategic, it's theoretical, and at times it's indubitably beautiful. An easy game to play but a hard one to master; learning tons of opening lines, doing middle game analysis, working on end game techniques. Although I've read my share of chess books and spent hours on game analyses, to be honest I don't play the game that much myself. That being said, I can't think of any other game I would have been willing to watch every single day for the past five years.

Note: I will not be logging any plays of chess, because I find myself constantly indulged in the game and tracking that would be extremely difficult.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
The one grand old classic that I play quite regularly. It would take more than one human life to master this game, and I know I play it very badly. I just don't want to use the time it needs. I won't bother learning for example go because I know I won't have the time it deserves either. So chess is the game of which I have some literature and the game about which I want to try to understand at least a little bit.

It's hard to rate chess here. I think I still have to give it a 10 although it responds to a different need for boardgames than other games here. Chess is a perfect game that I play whenever I have time and suitable company for it.

The "Marvel heroes" version was given to me as a gift.  It doesn't get a lot of plays (nobody ever wants to play plain ol' chess when they can choose from the hundreds of other games from my collection), but it satisfies my superhero lovin' geek side just fine.  The pieces look really good too.  Maybe I'll make up some variant rules to make it seem more Marvel-universey.

(found a chess set when cleaning apartment. Maybe I should do some cleaning more often?)

Chess obviously isn't a bad game. I just don't really want to play it. There is just too much to learn if I wanted to play it on any level above beginner. Not problem of Chess but all non-luck (abstract) games as well. One plus for Chess is that many westerners know the rules (most of them anyway) which is some extra plus if you want to play with a non-gamer.

Played quite a lot when I was about 8-10 years old. I remember having borrowed lots of chess books from the library, and being the only one of my group of friends who could beat the Sinclair ZX computer ;P My father had a very nice plastic travel set but I mostly played on a normal board.

RATING: 9
This rating is based on hundreds of game plays. I've played chess since childhood and have always enjoyed playing it against opponents of my strength. I am probably only rated around 1500, but that is good because at this level the game is still quite interesting. However, I believe that the game is fundamentally flawed because at high levels of play the game results in too many draws. This is because as the game progresses the ability to attain the goal of the game diminishes for both players. Thus it is not able to differentiate players as well as games like Go. Also if one wants to go beyond casual play it requires a lot of memorization of openings and end games. The domination of Chess by computers is perhaps also hurting the game. I still give Chess a high rating because most people will be casual players and will enjoy the sharp tactics of the game. For anyone interested in a game that can be played with a Chess set, is computer resistant, and still very fresh I would recommend trying out a game that I invented called Arimaa.

I played a lot of chess growing up, but didn't really get "serious" until firstie year at West Point. That year I played a bumch of quads and octagonals at the Marshall club on weekends and would drive to some others and sleep in my car. After graduating in 1989, I won a class prize for $1,000 in Buffalo, and went on what I called my summer chess tour, going to the National Open in Vegas, and the World Open and Action Chess Championship in Philly. I played a little bit in the Seattle area, but slowly stopped playing tournament chess.

I do play a lot of blitz, and have recently been playing Crazyhouse, which is a Chess/Shogi hybrid.

Nothing beats a few good games of speed chess.

I do see the fascination behind it and the cleverness, but it's just not for me. It feels just not fun for me, but instead almost like work to keep the overview, plan ahead and think about all the possible outcomes. With abstracts I often have the feeling I have to play not only my moves but all the possible ones of my oponent even more, so I have the feeling of playing against myself more than anything.

Rating Chess clearly is a violation of my humility standards ! I'll do it now that I have begun. Chess is undoubly a wonderful game with huge possible discoveries for years. However, for me, the pattern of interest versus involvement became almost flat after 2 years practice, so I finally abandonned.

I love chess.


Chess is the first TRUE game i ever played. When i was little i played against my mom, i also did some young plp tournements ... in highschool i did the chess team... and after college i did the FICS (free internet chess server) for about a year (the FICS is cool because it calculates your chess rating and lets you play againsts similarly rated plp)

now i don't play so much, but it's only because i don't have a good chess partner... and because there are so many other games to play



Chess is a beautiful game, it's exact, there are correct moves and incorect moves... since I can't comprehend all of chess at once it makes it fun. Chess is a simple excersise between 2 people about whom can comprehend more, and whom can retain their focus for longer.

If you add the timer into chess it becomes different story altogether, now it becomes just as much about time management as anything else... It's still fun, and it's nice to known that the game will at least be over in X minutes, but theres nothing worse than losing for time when you have the tactical advantage

i prefer playing real plp over the computer... it's almost like when playing a real person they have linear thoughts that you can follow based off of thier past moves/games/reactions... each game can get you closer to being able to understand and defeat your opponent. 
Playing the computer is much less fluid, the computer can calculate all moves, but randomly makes bad moves based on a selected "skill level"... playing the computer is almost like solving a brain teaser instead of playing a game. 



i highly recommend this game to kids... it's a great time to get them to start thinking abstractly, develop patience, and to learn how to lose without getting upset.

for adults it can be fun too, but it's extreemly cerebral. I can only really play against other chess players... there is SUCH a learning curb, and if the person isn't patient (i.e. willing to lose about 50 games) their not going to be a fun time... plus i dont think its fun to win 50 straight game against novices either.

I credit this game for helping me to devlop MANY of my tactical and abstract abilities...



an intersting thing about chess is that it is such a black and white "i'm better than you game" that it turns many people off... my favorite opponent is someone that is slightly better than myself, and willing to play many many times... so hopefully i can get better




p.s. I have also played "bughouse" a handfull of times... its a fun varient on chess for 4 plp... it's a great time, but it requires all plp to be on similar levels

I'm only an average player, but I've been playing this since I was 7. I once tried to learn it seriously for a year or so, but ultimately, other games are just more enjoyable. I'm usually looking for relaxation in playing, and Chess is another kind of "building site", another type of enjoyment. Chess means brain work and the joy of being able to understand the game. 

It's certainly undisputed that the game itself is outstanding in the sense that it has a special significance. However, I do not believe that this is justified by its design. ANY game of comparable complexity, with identical start and victory conditions and not involving randomness could be studied as deeply as Chess. Openings and end games can be rather formal. It's only fun when both the players perform on the roughly same skill level. 

In other words: I think it is overrated.

Chess is the first game I remember playing.  My father taught me to play at an early age, out of desperation for someone to play with, I believe.  The set we played on had rooks that were elephants, which I found enchanting.  Although I'm not a particularly strong player, I will never turn down an opportunity to play.  It's a very challenging, exciting and dynamic game that requires concentration and focus.  You need not be a master to get a great deal of satisfaction from a game of chess, but finding an opponent of fairly equal skill level will make the experience much more enjoyable for both players. (4+3)

A cool layered chess set.  I think it was sold at Spencer's and called a medieval dragon set or something like that.  Also have a ROTK chess set that I just use to replace the cones in the LOTR game by Knizia.  Much cooler looking and more thematic with the whole fellowship included on the board.

How did I not put a set on my owned list?  Really I have alot of sets...who doesn't.  I added this because I just picked up a "teacher's" set to teach the "kids"

Now the real comments:

Chess is that game a family member teaches you and you spend the rest of your childhood trying to beat them.  I finally achieved mine around 2010.  Now, I am by no means a great chess player, hell I kinda suck, but that is probably why it is a 7, there is still challenge for me and it is still a good exercise.

Perfection over the centuries! Both players have the exact same resources in the exact same layout! No room for luck, no silly excuses: you play right you win, you play wrong you loose! No secret cards, no hidden advantages, transparent and simple, yet very deep and complex! Best game ever given to mankind. I won't give any other game a perfect score, the best any other game can get compared to this one is 9.9 at most. No other game will ever be this good. The more you play the more you discover, the more you share with your opponent the more you learn. It is philosophy, it is ideology, it is life-style... all crammed into this one huge awesome fantastic game. The absolutely best! Unmatched.

Probably the most overrated game of all times. Very limited mechanics leads to a very low skill level. This is the most advanced memory game ever invented. The more you remember the more games you win. Ok, I agree memorizing moves is a skill, but there is no tactics or strategic skills in this game whatsoever. For a computer it's not a memorygame, its calculation. The computer that manage to calculate the most possible moves will win.

Ive spent so much time on this game in my life I cannot give it anything lower.  Boy, it feels great to win.  But the amount of study required to reach the higher levels takes a lot of the fun out of it; studying opening lines is a total bore.  For two experienced players evenly matched, there is a definite advantage to going first.  The player with the black pieces seems to either have to play for a draw, or commit to something risky to try for a win.  Draws are much too common at the higher levels.  Games with fast time controls will always be a blast for me to play, but I think I am beginning to lose interest in the drawn out multi-hour games of tournament play.  There are also some chess variants becoming popular.  I think the jury is still out on Chess 960 (Fischer Random).  Bughouse is a multiplayer variant that is a ton of fun.

I do love chess. I love the abstract patterns.  And I like nice wooden chessmen.  

I like to study chess.  Chess problems have been the most effective for me.  I also like the simpler books on middlegame strategy, such as Silman's [b][i]Reassess Your Chess[/i][/b].

I play online at gameknot.com.

RATING: 6
A good game, but not worth of the insane amount of attention it gets.  Seems like what usually ends up happening is a whole lot of posturing until someone bites and sets off a chain reaction which removes a bunch of pieces of both colors.  Then, more posturing, more piece exchanging, and then you end up in an end-game where one player is trying to checkmate, and the other player is just trying to avoid checkmate.

(5+ plays)

RATING: 8
A timeless classic.  Unfortunately I am good enough to beat almost all casual players, but play nowhere near often enough to beat a serious player.  With each game being a forgone conclusion, it takes away my enjoyment.  It is also stressful, as one wrong move can doom you. Dime not shown
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
King of games. For a reason. Yes, it has grown problematic that computers are beating everyone now, so don't play them. Introduce a chess clock to bring life back into your play. True, more fun will be had if you can find equal level opponents. This game to me is the ultimate gateway game. Almost everyone has played it once, and if you are gentle, you can talk people into it, and steer the conversation toward other games. It is a fantastic bridge-builder between ages of people (kids can play well against adults), a wonderful mental exercise, and a national obsession for many parts of Europe. It handicaps easily with a clock, or by subtracting pawns, or by playing black. If you tire of the memorization of openings, play Fischerandom!

RATING: 6
Elegant in its simplicity. Unfathomable in its depth.

Update:
I still believe Chess is a brilliant game.  No luck involved.  I do have to be honest and say that I'm not always in the mood to play it.  This is the most mentally draining game I know.

A great but overrated game, that in my opinion is too tactic, has got dozens of useless rules coming from history, and gains his overstimated fascination from the great champions of the past and from its simulation of a real battlefield. The game is still a great game, but it has been too much studied and there are too many professional or semiprofessional experts around. Tournaments are horribly long, ratings and titles meaningless.

My main reason for the hate is I don't really know how to play besides knowing how the pieces move.  I don't even remember the notations I used to know.  If I ever took the time to study I may just like it - but it is doubtful.  Never been much of a fan of abstracts.  Not saying the game itself is bad - just that I don't like it and it's bad for and to me.

RATING: 7.8
This game is a classic. You never know when your knowledge of chess will pay off. Get in a heated discussion? Settle it with a chess match.

This is a perfect example of a great game, which is why a lot of people don't play it. It has absolutely no luck mechanics, requires deep look-ahead, and doesn't have comeback mechanics.

On the down side, it's absolutely brutal for beginners. They'll have no chance against an experience player, and if you're the expert, you'll be able to crush them so hard they'll never play you again. If that's what you're looking for, this is definitely the game for you.

RATING: 6
Superb game per se. But. The playing time is faaar too long if played correctly. And that leads to me playing faaar too aggresively, which usually means either win a short game or loose the queen early :)
Very good game though. A pity it does not really encourage attack but instead defence. Would probably not play it today when there's so much else to choose among these days. Hence the rating.

RATING: 5.5
Chess is always a wonderful game - one I haven't seem to mastered.  I always enjoy playing, but quite often get my butt kicked.  (For the record, I tend to start with a good strategy, but often get overly focused on my attacks and miss seeing the attacks being made upon me....)  With that said, I still find it a wonderful game to pull out fairly often.  I consider this a complex abstract stategy game, meaning there are lots of types of moves the pieces can do - compared to a simple abstract strategy game where only a few types of moves are allowed.  Decreased rating - I have found too many games that have the same strategic value that I find more fun.

I suppose I rate this only a 6 *not* because I'm no good at it -- I'm no good at lots of games -- but because (a) it's so familiar, even iconic, to so many people that it's hard to generate enthusiasm for it as a game, rather than as a kind of cultural touchstone, and (b) for what it is, a largely abstracted capture-based wargame, other games play out that theme better.  Even Stratego adds the 'fog of war' to the matrix, improving on Chess.

My rating is by BGG standards.  Chess (along with Go) is perhaps the greatest game ever invented.  C'mon -- what other game in western history has ever attained this kind of iconic (and, indeed, real) significance?

Pros:

-A lot of people play
-There is something satisfying about having an idea for a win and that plan coming together especially when the opponent can't do anything about it, making your opponent squirm and getting checkmate.
-for those fluent is chess tactics at least there are variation.

Cons:
-someone else that is studied will always crush you
-takes some work to get decent at it and get good with tactics and then more to get good at strategy.

I'll confess to being a club/tournament player (alas, currently lapsed), and think OTB is the way to go with a nice relaxed time control. I can't even play G/60 without serious clock issues. The arguments against chess are well-known: you need to study for many hours, it's hard to find someone at the same level, thinking makes your brain hurt, etc. But if there's a deeper strategy game, it would have to be Go or Shogi or something like that.

I appreciate it as a good strategic game, but find it's hard to find people to play it with.

I think chess is a great game and I went through a period where I played quite a bit.  Certainly not light or interactive and I'm not the type that can look at the board and see how things will unfold in most cases.  So it involves a lot of concentration, weighing the choices, thinking what your opponent will do, etc... and sometimes I'm in the mood for that, but less so these days.

Imbalanced unless players are of same skill (which to improve means whittling away your life reading and recording matches), but also rewards aggressive play. This is really a game to display how clever you are and your status in the world. I can only endure this with a chess clock set at 5 mins each, no time for determining the optimum move, and besides mistakes can be made, giving me hope. Still I appreciate the interesting problems the pieces pose in the quest of trapping the king.

-

The greatest 2-player game ever. Time-tested and time-proven. Purest form of strategy and tactics. Amazingly, dozens of people on this board have rated chess 1's 2's and 3's!! One of the given reasons is that players who have read books on chess have a huge advantage. Of course they do! Just as with any board game (of limited luck and randomness,) the more you play and the more you analyze your moves and your mistakes, the better you get at it, and will have an advantage over the other players. Chess, obviously has been around for centuries and as a result has been played billions of times and every move scrutinized, and thousends of sequences of opening moves have been analyzed in depth. Naturally, players who spend the time and effort to learn lots of opening move variations have an advantage. This is true of any game, particularly 2-player games in which no elements of luck or random events are involved (dice, event cards, etc.)

However, I do understand these people's point of view. If there is too big of gap between the skills (and/or the opening move repertoire) of the two players, the fun factor will be practically non-existent for both players (especially for the stronger player!)

Another stated reason for giving chess a low rating has been, "it is boring". This cannot be further from the truth. Chess might look boring only to the impatient and may I say, to those who have little or shallow understanding of the game. Chess has inspired millions to write books about it. Do you really think a boring game is capable of generating so much inspiration and interest?

How many books would you think will be written about Puerto Rico in the next five hundred years?

(Puerto Rico is the current #1 game on BGG, as of Feb. 2005.  And don't get me wrong-- in my opinion Puerto Rico IS the best multi-player board game at the present time.)

I like just about every 2-player abstract strategy game -- except for Chess.  Chess is inelegant and has numerous problems.  For example, I hate it in games where the person who is losing can try to play for a stalemate.  

Try Go instead.  An infinitely superior game.

So I finally agree to play your stupid abstract game and I battle and struggle and fight and I lose many playing pieces through the war but now I've wiped out your entire forces and household and only your king remains alive - and I have him surrounded by plenty of my remaining forces and household...and...and...and somehow you f###ing win because of some rule that lets you win if you can't move???? OF COURSE YOU CAN'T  MOVE - I'VE JUST WIPED OUT EVERYONE BUT YOUR KING AND HAVE HIM SURROUNDED AND HE'S FINISHED...But nope.. you win... 

WTF???!!

GTFO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and take your stupid game with you.

Schach ist einfach ein einzigartiges Spiel- nicht umsonst wird es seit hunderten Jahren gleichermaßen gespielt. Mir gefallen die unterschiedlichen Möglichkeiten der Spielgestaltung: spiele ich aggressiv und setze den Gegner unter Druck? Oder verteidige ich diszipliniert und warte auf meine Chance? Schach macht mir als Hobby-Spieler Spaß; wenn man jede Möglichkeit 10 Minuten bedenkt und zu strategisch an die Sache herangeht, finde ich es hingegen ziemlich kacke. Außerdem habe ich mittlerweile deutlich über 100 Partien auf dem Buckel- langsam bin ich "schachsatt" (auch wenn mir eine gemütliche Partie stets hold

Ah chess. A quintessential strategy game to which most games aspire. It is an intricate game and I always can feel the pressure of my pieces versus those of my opponents.
 
Yes it is the one game that has been studied to death. It is really one that requires you to think ahead.
At one point I was fairly good but don't play enough now.

Ah Chess.  I have a strange love-affair with this game.  Sometimes I like it and sometimes I hate it.  I learned the basics back in middle/high school.  My father, as he did with many games, taught me how to play by ruthlessly beating me multiple times until I started to understand the strategy behind the game.  I'm still not the greatest, but I occasionally surpise myself, especially in "speed chess" where you only have a total of 5 minutes per player per game (recorded on a time clock).

RATING: 7
Oh, Chess, the deserved most respected game (or is it a sport?).
Sure it's a wargame: two opposing armies fighting against each other on a square battlefield, positioning their units in the best spots, combinating them to destroy enemy pieces, till one captures another's king. Feels like war from the very first move, 100% direct confrontation.
It's a superb game, deep and elegant, but has also some weak points:
* it plays slow (there are some quick variants but they're not true chess). After the first ones, each move is a solitaire deep mental exercise that requires complete silence.
* it's not only about talent, it needs two equally prepared players (which is hard to find). I, that once read and studied some chess, would beat my wife and friends 10 out of 10 plays easily, but high level players would beat me badly too without any tension.
So usually we play other games that besides thinking allow for talking and laughing, and where the winner is not known before the start.

I'm not a very good Chess player, but I still enjoy it. The game isn't quite so much about winning because the skill of the player will generally determine the outcome before the game is even played.

I was never a good chess player as a kid, and nothing in adulthood has changed that. I don't see the game with any clarity at all, and there are numerous other games out there where I can both visualize and execute strategy over several moves. I simply don't understand chess. When I look ahead, all I see is chaos. Any logged plays of it are basically under duress, as I will never suggest it. I can teach the game (I played it a lot as a kid, though not seriously), and I know how the pieces move in order to create my options, but as far as how to leverage that into skill? I haven't a clue, and have no real desire to change that.

Rating is for more than just the game - it's for the social and support structure that surrounds it.
Classic game, with almost endless depth.
Problems are the game pushes you towards AP, and rewards people who study book openings the most. However, the more you study other people's strategies, the less of you you bring to the game. The game becomes how much of OTHER people you have absorbed.
This inevitable decline means that for me, the game ceased being fun past the casual youth level.

This is not really the rating of the game itself, which is really good. It reflects my desire to play chess, and this is limited. Even though I like abstracts in general this feels like there is too much work necessary in order to be able to play ok, at least for me. It happens quite often that I do a really bad move which I decided just a second before that this move would be really bad, but later I forget this analysis. Maybe I am just to stupid for this game.

Many plays throughout the years, since about age 9 or 10.  Not sure what it says about me, but once I get to the mid-game, I can't keep track of all of the possibilities and my game goes to hell.  Heck, it's probably gone there even before mid-game--I am just to slow to realize it.  I am very likely to give up a big piece as a result of missing a trap or a fork or simply by leaving myself open to an unseen threat.  And now that you know that about me, it should be easy to beat me.

Chess. One does not bash Chess. The game of kings, the game people advise those in military command to study to help them think more strategically. A game of perfect information, of zero luck, and infinite re-themeability (Look it's a Beverly Hillbillies vs. Aliens Chess set!). And I... do not like Chess. Couldn't ever get into it. I'll play it, but I'm not especially good at it and I probably won't have fun. It's an abstract and I tend not to enjoy those very much, I also don't really like games that have [i]no[/i] luck (conversely I [i]hate[/i] games that have a very high degree of luck). And I'd like to know [i]why[/i] this was (mostly was, not so much now I reckon) considered such a great strategic training game. Luck, or at least chance, is an [i]enormous[/i] factor in war and most "war games" acknowledge this in spades with their mechanics.

Anyway, Chess is amazing for it's ability to stand the test of time (how likely is it that we will be playing Agricola in 500 years? Not very) but it just doesn't tickle my fancy.

no luck - pure skill, can make games very lopsided if players are of different levels

I'm playing it more and it's definitely a classic game, but it can be just so deterministic sometimes. I mean if you do not see a move coming, then BAM you are gone. Of course at that point, you might want to forfeit, but yes it can be unforgiving and brutal.

This rating is apparently famous. I mean it's a good game. It's just very... unforgiving. Losing a good piece can domino into a loss. The only hope is that the other guy will make a large mistake as well. But if you've lost a piece, you're probably more likely to make a mistake, SO YOU DIE.

I just think in the game you have to be laser precise, unlike say Race for the Galaxy where I have some leeway in going several directions.

I've got a glass chess set that's missing a white pawn.  I also lose about 95% of the chess games that I play. I don't enjoy chess because I find it difficult to imagine what strategy my opponent might employ. I don't care to read up on chess strategy and I don't particularly care for how little delight I feel when I play chess.  Consequently, I tend to play chess very rarely. In fact, now that I own games that allow the people I play with to get their fill of strategy and tactics while still allowing me to feel at least small delights, I will probably not play chess ever again.

Chess stresses me out.  The problem is that I *used* to be quite good, way back in grade school.  I played in tournaments around my state at the high school level.  I don't know about other people, but for me it is *NOT* like riding a bike, it doesn't just come back to me.  So now, after not playing for 15+ years except for the casual game every other year or so, I feel myself playing and know that I used to be better.  I fall prey to things I should have seen coming from miles away and make mistakes I never would have made before, and it all just frustrates me to no end.

The books go back on the shelf, and I go back to less-intense gaming challenges.

I've wasted way too much time in my life on chess....ever since my mother-in-law bought me a copy of chessmaster when I was in graduate school.  I play at itsyourturn.com (ID=rjcharte).....give me a game sometime!

I always have a game of chess set-up on my desk at work.  Good for some stop-in conversations and discussion of strategy and tactics.

If you haven't played chess with a clock, give it a try ....it adds a new dimension to the game.....once you've played with a clock you won't go back!!  5 minute blitz chess with an equal opponent is a gaming experience that is very difficult to match.

As much as I enjoy the insular nature of being good at a game because I had to study it, there is a wall around chess that keeps it out of our gaming group and, to a degree, out of my life in general. Sad, since I used to play it very often

The game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement. Several very valuable qualities of the mind, useful in the course of human life, are to be acquired or strengthened by it, so as to become habits, ready on all occasions. For life is a kind of chess, in which we have often points to gain, and competitors or adversaries to contend with, and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events, that are, in some degree, the effects of prudence or the want of it.

RATING: 4
As always, '4' is based on my personal motivation to play. There certainly isn't anything "wrong" with Chess—in fact, quite the opposite—but....

Well, one, I, however much I admire many of them, am not an abstract person. I admire the thought and depth and practice that is sunk into this game on a daily basis by more people than will ever hear of some of my favorite games.

Two, I, unlike them, *have* heard of other games, and I'm much too busy trying to do more than just scratch the surface of a good number of great games, to be able to do the same with Chess. If I wasn't busy with an impossible number of hobbies, I might be able to settle down with Chess and give it the appreciation it deserves. But my mental space is far too clamorous for that to happen.

What to say about chess? I hardly ever play this any more, but I used to be quite serious. I guess the fact that I played this competitively for ten years shows that I'm the type of person who would rather play the same games over and over (and get good at them) than play a wide spread of different games. Unfortunately, I am out of practice and so my willingness to play is lowered. In the back of my head every once in a while, I think that I should start to get good again, but the allure of tournaments has kind of faded for me. Maybe I'll pick it up again in 30 years or so.

Which of the current Top 100 games will end up with the staying power of chess?  Do we really expect folks to be playing Settlers or Ticket to Ride or Carcassonne in four hundred years?  Longevity in and of inself is not a good enough criterion for a game to be great.  But when it's added to terrific strategy, logic, low levels of luck, and great accessibility then you've got one heck of a game.

I used to be a really keen chess player in my youth (although I was never particularly good - about average club level). I've not played in over 10 years though, and although I still have a lot of respect for the game (and can't bring myself to throw out my dozens of chess books), I just can't see myself getting back into the game. I know that says more about me than the game, but the BGG rating system is based on how much you want to play games, and at the moment I can never see myself choosing to play chess.

Chess is the kind of game that the more you play, the more you like it.  When you learn to sympathise with the plight of bishops, to make your head dance with action when studying lines of attack, it becomes that much more interesting.  That is to say, the interesting stuff is what's going in your head, not interaction with your opponent.  I personally like GO better--go lights up more parts of my brain than does Chess--but chess is still fun and has the advantage that most people in the US know how to play.

RATING: 10
Chess used to be my favorite game. But I've found after years of playing and studying go, and a little bit of time spent studying chess, that my craving for chess has diminished. The depth and profundity of the early go game has this thickness and texture that chess doesn't for me... and the wildness and creativity and intensity of the shogi endgame makes me far happier than the ultra-calculative chess endgame. These days, I'd almost always rather go with go or shogi than chess... my chess sets come out way more for bughouse than the original...

Used to play extensively in school...but lately have been turned off the game as the openings are "rote" and the enjoyment of the game comes only from intense study.  In an evening spent playing 1 chess game, I much prefer the variety of board and card games I could play instead.

(As for my rating - yes, Chess is a perfect information abstract.  But (to quote the rating r{[b]it doesn't get me, but I could be talked into it on occasion.[/b]}r  There are folks out there that swear by this game, but for me it is just an exercise in memorization and brute force calculations.

I played, studied, and was fascinated by this game as a kid, but my interest wore off with time. It might have been because I played too much and got tired of it, or because I developed other hobbies that I liked better, or because I lacked confidence. Whatever the reasons, I took to avoiding it, for years.  

But I recently played a bunch of quick games during a long flight and had fun. It makes me think that with the right person and the right situation, I'm still capable of enjoying it. There are other games I like more nowadays, but I try to keep an open mind about chess.

I've had a long relationship with Chess, as described in this category's header. It began to wane after high school, though, and I never really picked it up again. Go hit like lightning a decade and a bit later, and I haven't looked back.

It was only after about 10 years of Go that I've begun to want to play other abstracts, which is nice (and more social). I had a brief flirtation with the GIPF games, owning all of them and playing them as a group, as recommended, but they didn't stick. I've found that post finding Go, I am not so interested in abstracts where the pieces move about willy nilly. I want something where a piece stays where I put it. Capturing is ok, but my strategic mind wants to be able to rely on something, an ever changing framework of stability, to base subsequent moves off of. THe slow building, the repurposing of previously played pieces, the long term implications of long ago placed pieces, that is exciting to me now.

Playing Chess nowadays is like watching Basketball after watching the World Cup. Going from scoreless games, or 1-5 points total scored by both teams over hours, to points being slammed in every 30 seconds, as fast as they can be counted, you have 50! no, 100! why not! feels a little trashy or something (no offence to basketball players, fans! I'm obviously a sports Philistine).

So, I gravitate toward Hex, Blokus, Quoridor, etc. I break out a chess set every now and then, but mainly speed games--if you're going to play trashy, let's get into it! To be honest the speed also assists my playstyle--I was never very good at opening or mid-game, but I was an end game wizard. "I have to get like 75% of the pieces off of the board, so I can think!" I used to say to myself, trading anything I could, for any reason. I could have seen at that point that Chess wasn't my best game, I suppose...but when I went to high school, it wasn't like there were any other games that offered endless opponents, intellectual and competitive recognition or accolades, so I was stuck with it.

I still have my high school chess sets--the travel one my math teacher (/chess mentor) gave to me in grade 11, and the expensive one with weighted wooden pieces and large heavy board my mother bought for me in grade 10, though, so nostalgia pulls heavy on this one obviously. 

Despite all of the above flaws, I can't get rid of this one, or stop playing when asked. Or rate it lower. Humans are so confusing...

Playing a game with one-minute turns is fun. 

I might not be quite as bad at this as I thought. I don't always have a real nuanced idea of what I'll do many turns ahead and am not sure I can given another player's unpredictable input, but I do have general ideas and find that swarming often creates check/mate/resignation situations. 

As a kid I took this game off-board, ranging the pieces across my fireplace and carpet, throwing pieces at one another as a mode of attack. If an opponent's piece was knocked over, it was taken. Now that's a wargame.

I really should get around to playing and studying some more chess. I think I've learnt as much as I can by stumbling through casual games. Games that take a lifetime to master are a bit annoying, but it's nice to have a meatier game that everyone around the world is familiar with.

The only reason that I don't rate this higher is that the early game can be quite cluttered (at my low skill level, anyway). And it seems that if you are trailing, it's difficult to leap into the lead with a brilliant move, because a mate later in the game (i.e. a non-smothered mate) usually requires a piece advantage.

A fine game, but with its drawish tendencies (to the point where aiming for a draw is a valid strategy) and lack of a handicap system, it doesn't hold a candle to shogi or go in terms of playability, IMO. I would like to play with a shogi style handicap or different clock times for each player, if that were acceptable to the chess community.

My master plan is to one day beat my GameBoy (original) at this on the third lowest setting. So take my criticisms here with a grain of salt.

Just wish to be clear that the relatively low rating is based on my hesitation to play, although I do go through phases of being fired up about the game. Half an hour spent reading up on basic strategy ought to open up the game for most people, and disprove the usual silly objections about it being a game that rewards memorizing sequences of opening moves. Not that people have to like chess, but when BGGers call the game 'broken,' well, they sound a little bit ridiculous. 

First game my wife and I played together. Mrs Schkff comes from one of those cultures where chess is routinely played in school and everybody knows how to play.

Edit : am upping my rating, as there's no way I'd turn down a game or three, and am happy being beaten by someone who can really play, or else coaching someone in the basics. Chess is fun! 

Theme somewhat pasted on, though, it has to be admitted. And what self-respecting king would marry a pawn, just because it made its way across a battlefield? Tsk.  

Edit again 2014: Rating dropped a point again - am just not feeling the Chess love at the moment. Thjis may change as the kids get old enough to learn.

You know what you're getting into with chess, and it's not too hard to find opponents who'll give you a game without any need for rules refreshers. Since my youth (where I played it quite a bit), I've enjoyed picking this up for the odd game now and then, but it fails to excite me. In order to play well you're going to need to really study the game, and I'm just not that interested in investing the time in something this dry and abstract. At the end of the day I'd rather invest the time in an historical simulation game - something from Columbia Games or GMT - than this 64 square classic. It's certainly not a bad game, but just not for me.

A game that can be learned in a couple of minutes, and takes the whole life to dominate it.  I think I'd rate this better if I wasn't that bad at it.  It's a good analytical game, but for some reason it don't like me.  I study, try new tactics, take my time between movements, and always lose.  At the end of a game, I usually feel intelectually tired and I have no desire of playing again for a while.  By the other hand, the game seems to be unbalanced, cause the white player has more chances to win than the black one.  Besides, playing correctly will always lead to a tie, and I like games that normally are won by somebody.

It's chess! 

Perhaps not "perfect" as some have touted it as being, but it's also not "massively over-rated" as many nay-sayers claim it to be. In reality, this is a very strategic game of cold-calculation that deserves its regal status of prestige that it has been enjoying for centuries - a real workout for the brain.

Works beautifully with variations as well, adding to its re-playability.

This is it, the game that started it all for me.  Cheap, portable, and insanely deep.  You can always find an opponent or book on this game anywhere in the world, including your phone!  Every time I play, I learn something new about the game and sometimes myself, the mark of a truly great game.  Like most people, this is my first strategy game, taught to me by my father, making this more than just a game, but a vehicle to relive a piece of my childhood.  Often, while looking at the board, I reflect on my past, those that played Chess during historic times, the great masters, and the politics of nations that surrounded this game.  Thats when Chess becomes more than just a board, pieces, a puzzle to solve, and an opponent to beat, for me it becomes something so much larger.  Over the years I have learned to love, hate, and respect this game like no other board game, Go would be a close second.  I will always play chess to the end of my days, cherishing the time of analyzing the board, my opponents, the history of the game, and all it's lessons.  Chess can be cruel, punishing, rewarding, exhilarating, and will always be my number 1.

It's chess. I used to like it a lot, back when my brain worked. Actually, I'm not sure it ever worked, but I played chess a lot better than I do now. And I didn't play all that good then. So now, you may surmise -- I play worse. In any case, if I get back into playing chess, my rating will rise comensurate with my skill level. UPDATE: Ok, playing a little more regularly. Still suck ass at it, but I remember what I like about it. Leaving rating at a 7 because while I'm playing more computer chess games, and I'll play a person if offered, I'm still not likely to offer a game myself. Realistically though, this game should be rated a 10. It's the granddaddy of abstract board games and has enjoyed a fanatical following for far longer than almost everything else in my collection (mancala/wari excluded).

For the record, I have entered chess tournaments and I am a teacher who runs the chess club. There are few games that match the depth of chess. The philosophy of attack, defence and patience can be taught through this game. However, after you reach a certain level, memorization is the key. To be competitive by using reasoning, there is a high level of memorization needed. For example, I have what is called an "opening book" of moves which I use. If you are better at chess than I am, but have a poor set of opening moves, you will be at a disadvantage because you haven't taken the time to memorize sequences. There are hundreds of books on just one set of these opening moves. Don't believe me? Look up "sicilian defence" or "Roy Lopez" on amazon. 

In short, chess is a good example of why a bit of randomness or secretiveness is necessary in a game. Without one of those two things, you get chess, which is unforgiving and has an incredibly high amount of work needed to be an entry level player. 

People who say this is a perfect game, have spent too long memorizing their openings to admit it.

Fun with somebody at your level. Pretty sick of this though, especially after reading some chess books and finding the cold mathematical reality behind this game. Too over-analyzed for its own good. You can improve your play to a high level quickly just by reading instead of playing, and I don't like that.

I much prefer Xiangqi with its wide-open counter-attacks, instead of setting up positions in Chess and turtle-ing your opponent to death.

Struggling to find something to say about this one. I mean, it's Chess; it's one of the oldest games around that's still played today.

I will say one thing; it's immediately evident that anybody who has studied Chess as an almost academic form, will immediately have an overwhelming advantage over the less experienced. There is no "pick up and play" with this game; nor is there room for even the slightest of errors. I'm not going to lie; I'm awful at this game. I prefer games with multiple options to victory, and unless given a broad arsenal in which to do that, which in this game I'm rarely given - unless against an opponent of complete and equal intellect, I'm inevitably going to lose. Badly.

I love abstract strategy games, and chess is what started that love.  However, at this point in my life, it is difficult to 1) find anyone at all to play and 2) have that person be at a level reasonably close to mine that the game is interesting.  The last person I was able to play on a consistent basis got swallowed up by internet games and so far outclassed me, it was not fun anymore.  Since that happened, I hae lost most of the desire to even play.  So, while I want this rating to be higher (and think it could be), it will have to languish here until I can find some opponents and a little desire.

The BGG rating system is the reason why this game is rated so low by me. It's not that it's a bad game, it's just I gave up on MY game improving. That's why I decided not to play anymore and that makes it a category 3 game.

I dislike games of perfect information. Like other such games, Chess has the problem that the main way to do better is to look ahead farther, which is not a good quality to have in my opinion. Chess has the additional problem that small mistakes can lead to huge, permanent disadvantages which are further compounded throughout the game. 

Nevertheless, deep games are always cool to observe and discuss.

Plainly put I love this game.

Pros - Rewards the time and effort you invest (zero chance), demands planning, said to improve memory and mental aptitude, different every time.

Cons - Strength disparities MUST be compensated for; otherwise the player who is much better will always win and (perhaps) discourage the poorer player.

The first serious game I ever learned, so I have to give it the highest rating, even though other chess games ... shogi and chu shogi come to mind ... may ultimately be richer games.

Played Chess for years and years in my youth matching wits with my cousins and close friends. After college it became increasing difficult to find anyone willing to battle it out on the chess board, but I still love the depth of strategy. Have owned many chess boards in my life, my favorite is an exquisitely carved marble set that I acquired from Natural Wonders back in the 90s along with a saber-toother tiger skull cast when that franchise was liquidating their merchandise.

The trick to keep chess enjoyable is to make sure your opponents are at about the same skill level as you, or just slightly higher. 
It sucks when you're constantly getting your butt kicked, or when there's no challenge. 
For a while I had rated this much higher, and will still play a game on very rare occasion - however since discovering more interesting strategy games my "how much would you like to play this" rating has dropped significantly.

The classic abstract strategy game. I used to play it several times a day and have worked through many books. I find analyzing the strategies can be addictive. If you play at all seriously, it's hard to find opponents aside from the internet (and I don't love/have time for online play). Without a clock it is highly AP prone.

My rating goes up significantly--maybe to 10--when I have a regular partner of similar skill. 

Sadly, I don't have that so I rarely play it. I'd love to change this.

I've read some convincing critiques of chess, but for some reason I'm not inclined to go lower than an 8. I spent multiple evenings playing it at college with a player of the same skill level and really enjoyed it. There are better games, but the many low ratings this gets seem too-often inspired by a need to buck a trend = a trend that's run for half a millennium.

RATING: 3
Great strategy game because there is no randomness except for who goes first.

Drawbacks:

-Comes in two unsatisfying flavors: Take turns that last forever or play Speed Chess and the person who makes the first big screw up loses
-Fun factor not high, mostly for the above reasons

[Thousands of plays spanning 40 years] (I started playing pretty decently in kindergarten.) Opinions of chess seem polarized, but for me it is a complex and rewarding game that has survived an incredible test of time because it is a good game. I have never read any geeky chess books, or memorized "opening gambits" - nor do I want to - but I can hold my own against some ok players. I still enjoy a game a few times each year, and I look forward to getting it out whenever my brother is in town. And yes, without a doubt, I would get smoked by any really good player.

I would rate Chess a 10, but it requires closely matched skill levels between opponents to shine at its brightest for both players.

The first (and only) game I ever got really good at. I am pretty much always up for a game of this against any competition (although, like all games, I only play f2f). Probably the only game where I am fine getting crushed, although I rarely lose against other casual players.

Admittedly, I don't actually enjoy this enough to join a chess club, so maybe my rating is a little out of line... On the other hand, that is also true for any other game I've ever played, so I guess I'll leave it there for now. 

I tried to teach this to Michelle back when we were in high school/college, but that never worked out. As a result I rarely get to play this anymore.

With the possible exception of go, there is no other game that has been the subject of so much study, or has so much depth.

I would give this game an "11" if I could rate it any higher.

I've never enjoyed Chess all that much. An occasional game can be fun, and I like plenty of abstract games, but Chess always seemed a little blah for me. I'd always choose to play Pente, or especially Go. For something mechanically closer to Chess, I'd choose Hive. I am not denigrating the game, it is a classic and deeply strategic. It just isn't to my taste as much as these others.

  I was a bit 'obsessed' with Chess as a laddie. Now I realize how utterly 'over-rated' and simplistic the game is. It should be called: "a 'million' obsessions over 6 little pieces'!?!

To me probably the worse part about chess is the memorization of successful opening moves and all of the books written about the game.  I would be much more willing to play some type of strange variation of chess.  I think the game could still be okay if the players were of similar expertise and skill, although the game seems long to me unless I get checkmated rather quickly.  It's still probably a good game to teach kids about critical thinking.

Chess has always seemed to me to be a game that stuffy intellectuals play.  Invariably, whenever I tell someone that I play a lot of board games, the question arises as to whether I play chess.  For me, chess is a game that has been analyzed to death, where one player with superior knowledge of movements will beat other players -- e.g. all strategy and knowledge, no tactics.  I prefer games where players are on a bit more of equal footing, and have to use their own wits and tactical abilities to examine and win the game.  What fun is it to sit down to a game of Puerto Rico with a player that has played 1,000 times and already knows the ideal move in every situation?  The same can be said for Chess.

I also defend my position on not playing chess by the sheer volume of analysis that is available for the game as opposed to other games.  I have been to two university libraries (University of Kansas and Kansas State) where the amount of chess analysis books can be measured in _feet_ (I think 30-40 feet in each library), whereas the books dedicated to all other games (including card games, gambling, other) is 1/6-1/4 as much.    Basically, I feel that I'm feet of reading behind the learning curve, and I'm not interested in catching up.

Played chess many times in my youth, and really tried to figure it out.  For quite a time I was the best player amongst my friends.  But over the years I have lost interest in it as I have found so many other great games.  I'm not much of an abstract lover in the first place.  Still, a fun experience if your opponent does not take too long to play.

I can't get away from this game. One of the best 2-player strategy games ever, but does require that both players be relatively equal in knowledge of the game.
I play regularly online at gameknot.com(as Sliver12) and freechess.org(as SliverXII). I only log my OTB games here however. If I logged all my online games I would be logging nearly 10 a day.

Tough time rating this.  I'm not a huge fan of chess, simply because of the amount of study that goes into becoming a great player, but I greatly admire the simplicity of its design.  However, I'm not going to do any puzzle-solving on the web, or read any books on chess history or strategy.  The fact that I don't have the patience to keep beating my head against this particular wall by actually playing (and losing) the game repeatedly tells me that the game itself doesn't hold much appeal to me.  So my 6 rating is the BGG "willing to play sporadically if in the right mood" variety, and is not a comment on the quality of the game.

I once read something along the lines of to improve in chess, games should be played against people whom you have about a 1/3 chance of winning. 

For me, playing against someone clearer worse than you gives little satisfaction and playing against someone who completely outclasses you gives little, if any, enjoyment. This game is best played against people with similar-ish skill who will give you a good challenge without being too easy or too hard.

Any game that can manage to endure for centurys must have some meat to it. Like "GO", this intricate stratagy game will always find a prominent place on my game shelf. A genre defining game (necessary for a 10 rating on my list) that is amazing on it's own, but now has gained some interesting new possibilities with variants like "Nightmare Chess". Besides I like the horsey pieces!

I love playing Chess.  It's the ultimate thinking game.  I've always felt that it actually makes your brain work in a way that is different than it normally works.  You can't just think about your next move......you have to think about your next few moves, and all the possibilities that are out there.  It's a beautiful game.

Chess deserves its place as king of the West's board games, but given the huge amount of study and literature devoted to it, I'm put off by the amount of learning needed to play passably well.  It's like learning to play a musical instrument but doesn't make as much noise.

I actually have a traveller's edition - has it every been played? I played a bit as a kid, but never really enjoyed it. I can see that it's a deep game ... it's just not for me; hence the relatively low rating, since I'll likely never play this again.

RATING: 7
Great game with a lot of engaging strategy, no luck involved, great pieces with variable powers. The downside for me is the need to study a lot of chess strategy if I want to play with someone, because usually who wants to play are experienced chess players and it would take a lot of beating up to learn it standard way. And I would probably not even get there, because these games take hours to play. I don't have that much time to spend on a single game. But still, I like the game for what it is.

This game is the one I've probably played the longest in my life.  My grandfather taught me how to play on an airplane when I was 5 and I've played occasionally ever since.

Despite that, though, I'm not very good.  I just don't have the mindset to think more than 1-2 moves ahead.  I don't have this issue with many of the other strategic games I play but for some reason I do when I play Chess.  I find myself on the back foot pretty often and typically win via a lucky or tactical move in that moment or a mistake on my opponent's part.

Chess is undoubtedly deep and interesting but I'm still only good for the occasional game.  Both because I usually lose and this game more than any other makes me feel like a lesser person when I lose and because it doesn't feel as much fun as it does an examination of my intellect.

Classic favorite, from childhood.  This game is an enigma.  With static starting positions for the last thousand years, there are many books on which moves and sequences of moves are best.  Many lengthy game sequences can be memorized from the game's beginning.  Still, the best players in the world invent new ways to win.
This is great as a casual game, rather than memorizing lengthy game sequences, you can have a fun meta-game using a few key principles from a beginner's book on chess.

I should like this more than I do. It shares a lot of common good points with Go like there is no hidden information, the better/most optimal player wins, complex, lifestyle game. However, I find chess to be really dry and linear in comparison. I think Go is much more right brained and Chess is much more left brained. Also, I find Chess feels way more tactical to me. Maybe if I was better at it I would like it more.

What can I say about a game that has been around for over 500 years, yet remains one of the most popular games in the world?  On the surface it is lovely in its simple beauty, yet below the surface it has a seemingly endless depth.  The fact that it is a game of no luck and all strategy is both its blessing and its curse, as far as I'm concerned.  I love the mental exercise of developing plans of attack and countering opponents' strategies, but I also feel like my intellect has suffered if I lose the game.  My main problems with this game are that I never seem to know what the good opening moves should be, if I get down a piece it becomes very difficult to come back, and I tend to bore my opponents by taking WAY too long to do each of my moves.  Yes, this (along with "Scrabble") is my Analysis Paralysis game, which is why I generally stick to playing online.  But that little issue is quickly solved by playing a game of five-second chess (your opponent counts out five seconds, and if you have not made your move by then, it becomes their turn again - very chaotic and confusing, but a good exercise in thinking fast after playing a regular game of careful analysis).  Of course, this is also a game where you need to have an opponent who is roughly the same skill level as yourself in order to make it a fun game for both.  Now if only I could find a Hundred Years War chess set for a reasonable price...  Game design: 5/5  Personal enjoyment: 3.5/5  Total: 8.5/10

The absolute classic game in Western civilization.
You can enjoy it even if your level of play is not very good; the only drawback is that the gap in skill between the players is not too high, if not it kills the interest for both players. It can be played in  various formats : rapid chess (blitz), casual play and problems solving. One particular and unusual use of the chessboard is the retro-analysis problems : you only need to know the rules in order to try to solve puzzles. A real blast if you like logical puzzles! I strongly recommend the book "The Chess Mysteries of Sherlock Holmes" by Raymond Smullyan)

Chess is a game that is easy to learn but takes a lifetime to master for most, and some never reach that level at all. It is an extremely deep game that allows players to work out moves well in advance and adopt strategies for dealing with pesky opponents. The game never plays twice the same way, which is good. I don't think of it so much as "fun" as I do giving my brain a 5k run, and yet it is enjoyable. In moderation.

RATING: 10
I have played this game more times than all others put together, from ten minute games to five hour ones. For many years it was my life and I still have a library of chess books.

Even though I don't play now, I have given it a 10 because it is the perfect blend of abstract game and feel. The pieces are thematic and the openings and defences are so full of meaning to an experienced player. Despite the fact that the pieces all start on the same 32 squares and there are only 64 playing squares in total, there are still fresh themes and lines being explored 500 years after its invention.

Chess is a fun and simple open abstract game, but the only thing that makes it interesting at all is that almost everyone in the world knows how to play. Otherwise this game would probably get a much lower rating for me. I'm just not much of an "all information open abstract gamer" type.

A couple of reasonable sets with inlaid boards, plus an electronic.  I used to play, poorly, almost every night, but now I'm tired of the game, and having fun is just as important as intellectual posturing.

RATING: 5.5
To dry for my liking, so it hits the table quite rarely. In my opinion, the game develops in the wrong direction, leaving you with less and less options as it goes on, which tires me quickly and makes me impatient at the same time. You discover no "new ground", but rather try to capture the opponent, which I find boring. Moreover, this game is taxing only on the tactical level, while there are no different strategies to employ. A timeless classic for sure, but I like other games better.

THE tactical masterpiece of the west.

I rediscovered chess during the summer of 2014. This really is an amazing abstract. The more you play it, the more it open up. I never really cared much for poring over the board face to face so I am currently enjoying 10 min/side blitz. It's a length of game that is fast enough to allow you to make mistakes quickly and learn from them without suffering through hours of agonizing defeat.

Beer and blitz is what it's all about.

It's fun, but after a while I realized that winning against skilled opponents came down to who had memorized more. Against more causal opponents, or my perfect equal in terms of chess knowledge it is a fascinating abstract game of tactics, deceit and mistakes. At all skill levels, it is a game won and lost on mistakes rather than on correct moves.

Chess was not reborn as a joyful game for me until I discovered the Alice variant--it involves two borads and players switch boards everytime they complete a move (this includes a capture, and the corresponding square on the opposite board must be empty for a move or capture to be legally undertaken). It was in the middle of a triple forking maneuver that, considering the movement possibilities of my opponent's surrounded king and queen and the positions of my pieces on both boards also amounted to a number of pins not geometrically possible in normal chess that I fell absolutely in love. I see your classic King's Indian Defense and raise you forced teleportation and one horrible corner to be stuck in. :D

Also, playing chess on a Kline surface is a sheer delight.

It's an average game for me without variations. With variations, the basic setup can truly become something marvelous.

It does get the feeling of sameness after a while. Not the positions on the board, they are like snowflakes, but the thinking involved is inevitably the same. You go through the same sort of protocol for each move: am I ahead in material? should I exchange pieces? should I exchange pawns? avoid exchanges? play positionally? Petrosian said it best: "it's a wooden game, the moves are wooden, the strategies are wooden. Even the pieces are wooden." Still it's addictive....

played this here and there over time and got quite good at it. but don't ever play an expert unless you're also an expert, cos you'll stand no chance.

If you can remember all the openeing moves etc then youll have a great advantage. too much of one to make it that enjoyable. unless you like to win before you even begin

great game for those of equal caliber though

I am bad at chess and I don't like abstracts so much. Despite that, I can appreciate that chess is a category unto itself. Chess is one of the few games that legitimately creates an emergent tapestry of strategy from a clean, elegant ruleset. The chess field is so wide that it incorporates play-styles and personalities in a way that most games only pretend to. 

Those personalities fill entire books, and they weather lifetimes of scrutiny.

I've never really liked chess. Very unforgiving for new players, which I think turns a lot of people off. Some unintuitive maneuvers (e.g., castling). If you're playing someone of equal skill, you'd better enjoy their company because you're going to be there for a long time. Not fun to lose, not fun to win. Seems like most people know most of the rules, but no one has their rule sheets anymore and everybody gets offended if you want to look up a rule online.

That's right, I'm reviewing chess.  How can one review a game that's older than any of our lifetimes, the answer is: Its not easy.  Chess is timeless, It's infinitely complex, has been redesigned component wise more times than god and the depth is astounding. Truly it is the starting point of strategy games, while at the same time the grandfather to so much more.  The pressure on the win and loss stems from a cerebral exercise making it seem like an accomplishment to win (a key factor to the enjoyment stemming from pure strategy).  However I've always found my big determent to chess is the play time.  Chess really isn't that exciting by modern standards (not that its supposed to be).  The endless struggle of attack and defense will carry through history however and as such that says something as a testiment to the game.  All these things considered there's so many other games I would rather play than a game of chess.  Games have since evolved and arched in so many different flavors and since my 6 yearold self I have since lost a taste for it.  That being said, chess gets a 7.

Nice idea poorly implemented.
The size of the pieces does not reflect traditional size relationships. Frodo, the bishop, is the smallest of the back row pieces. The Ringwraith queen is taller than Saruman the king. 
Most of the piece assignments don't make much sense.  Frodo mis more logically a knight than a bishop, which should be represented by Aragorn--not only for movement purposes, but because his character is much better suited to that role. The cave trolls are bishops!? These definitely belong at the end of the row, as rooks.
I hate, also that these guys are too big for the squares. Make a board big enough for your pieces, please! There is plenty of room in the box.

For me, the thing about chess that separates it from other games is that I almost always feel a sense of tension (excitement) when I play.  The kind of tension when watching a close sports match (like World Series game).  Very few low-stakes moves will be made in this game, if any at all, so there is a great deal riding on every turn. Although I enjoy many traditional boardgames, they don't produce this same level of excitement for me. [Full disclosure: I'm terrible at chess!]

Signor Gaspare replied: "And what do you say about the game of chess?"

"That is certainly a refined and ingenious recreation," said Federico, "but it seems to me to possess one defect; namely, that it is possible for it to demand too much knowledge, so that anyone who wishes to become an outstanding player must, I think, give to it as much time and study as he would to learning some noble science or performing well something or other of importance; and yet for all his pains when all is said and done all he knows is a game. Therefore as far as chess is concerned we reach what is a very rare conclusion: that mediocrity is more to be praised than excellence."

This is obviously a good and challenging game, but not one that I find personally enthralling. One problem is that I've never studied the game, and my opponents were all in chess club when they were younger. I have no mental catalog of openings, and I can't figure out the endgame to save my life. But I can "see" enough about this game to keep it enjoyable on the occasions when I do play.

Until recently, I hadn't played chess in almost twenty years.  Unsurprisingly, chess managed to survive this particular test of time.  I'm lucky to have people to play against who are at the same skill level as me (outright beginner), so we have lots of surprises and learning experiences in every game.  I get a satisfied feeling after a game of chess, like I know I have done something to better myself.  Not many games can provide that.

It's hard for me to even consider analysing, critiquing and rating such a celebrated game. Considered by many to be a 'perfect game', Chess is a giant of abstract strategy gaming; it is devoid of all luck, it is almost completely balanced (besides a slight advantage to first player) and yields a complex array of different possible moves, strategies and tactics. Entire books are dedicated to different combos of moves. And all this from a game that has been around for centuries. 

I played Chess constantly as a child, went to Chess club regularly, and grew up in a family of avid Chess players. I admire the game for what it is, and enjoy playing against opponents of a similar skill level to mine.

So do I dare critique it? Well, there are some issues for me personally. Chess is not kind to new gamers. It does not invite you in like newer games are good at doing, and it can be quite long. AP abounds. The end game can become a game of drawn out 'cat and mouse', and I feel there are games that better streamline the experience.

But for all that, it is a great game. And I have probably just personally exhausted it somewhat. Considering I've been playing it as long as I have, and can still enjoy it, says a lot.

Of course Chess is classic.  It's a great game to teach people.  But, when you get to a certain level, where people look at a board and can foresee all the next moves... and players follow a winning "pattern", it seems less like strategy to me and more like using the patterns in Pacman.

An eternal game, to be sure. I'm just not a huge fan. I tend to enjoy games that take a short time to learn, but a lifetime to master. But I tend to not like games where a lot of people actually do spend their lifetime trying to master it. 

I don't mind a casual game here or there, but I'm likely to lose pretty badly to anyone who plays even occasionally. I don't mind losing games, as I'm often an experiential gamer, but I find chess less rewarding because it doesn't tell a story. The game state doesn't evolve in a meaningful way to me. Whereas Go does. 

If I were going to play a chess-like game, I'd much rather play Tafl. I just find it more interesting.

The most complicated game everyone knows.  Memorize what each unit does, don't forget pawns only move forward 2 spaces if they haven't moved yet.  Oh, also there's this thing called castling.  Yeah units block, except that one unit that ignores that.  No you don't capture the king, you have to do that and make sure he can't move.  Oh, you might end up in a tie like tick-tac-toe.
This game's importance is incalculable, but there's better games out there that are more fun, easier to learn, and give just as much strategy.
Also suffers 1 player will probably beat the other every time they play.  I don't like it when 1 player just always wins.

I taught myself chess at around 8 or 9 years of age by reading the instructions on a family set. I played as often as I could find willing opponents, but there weren't many of those in my case. In my early twenties I became obsessed with the game and studied, researched and played daily. After two years of this obsession I quit. The reasons I quit playing would complete a dissertation. I will say that I still consider this one of the best games ever created and cannot imagine a world where chess is not taken very seriously by a lot of ridiculously talented people (who also are typically psychotic, rude, paranoid, unhealthy and generally terrible people to spend your time with).

I have known how to play this game since I was 9 yo. The gameplay didn't compel me to play it obsessively then as I do now. I remember losing constantly to my dad everytime we play, and because he is very competitive he never gave a a handicap or allowed to win even once. He instead gave me a an opening book for beginners to read. I didn't read the book and have not touch a chess piece ever since.

Until I got a laptop computer with a good internet connection. You see the average person needed a to train himself regularly in order to be "mediocre" in this this game. The internet helped me do that easily. Watching IM's play chess on youtube while they verbalize their thoughts have helped me to understand how to play this game to right way. This is the game that I'd play until my old age..

(+~500 Plays before I started counting)

Best Tactical Exercise Ever. If you want to try your mind against someone else, that's it.

It can take hundreds of matches to catch up with a better player, and the amount of concentration and brainburning required for a good match easilly qualifies chess as a mind exercise rather than a game.

I honestly think it shouldn't be here in the geek with the boardgames, as the purpose of chess is complelly different, and loving chess has absolutely nothing to do with loving boargames. Therefore I've completely removed my rating for it (initially it was 10) .

My toast really needs some butter. Way too dry.  Too much downtime, taken way too seriously.  Used to be interested slightly, until I found more accessible, fun, enjoyable games.  Needs players of almost identical skill to have worth.    This rating is the joy of having a comparable player.  With an uneven matchup, this is a 4.



The following has nothing to do with my rating but it is awesome.  From http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/18878/item/365361?commentid=680332

"I have heard it explained that, within chess, the movement of the pieces represents how their loyalty is split between the Church and the Crown. Orthogonal movement represents political (Crown) affiliation, and diagonal movement represents religious (Church) affiliation.

So, Bishops are exclusively loyal to the Church, while Rooks are exclusively loyal to the Crown. The King and Queen serve both, but not at the same time. Pawns move at the command of the Crown, but fight for their Church. Knights, with their code of chivalry, are sworn to serve both equally. So the Knights' L-Shaped movement is actually a political action combined with a religious action."

PROS: The king of all abstract strategy games. Fully tactical, no luck, brain-burner gameplay. A classic in every way;

CONS: Requires an opponent of the same skill level than you to be enjoyable; The basic rules are not so complex but also not enough for someone to fully understand the game: There are a LOT of small tactical details that need to be studied, learned and trained, so the game isn't very friendly to a new player; I consider it more a sport than a board game, because the only way to become really good at it is by taking it seriously and dedicating time to study and practice.

Difficult to rate this one. There is no doubting its classic design, however it defines analysis paralysis which makes it not great fun for me. Since I don't like timers in games, a chess clock is no solution.

Unless the players are evenly matched, Chess always seems like too high of a strategic learning curve to to just jump into.  Or maybe it's mostly that I've always preferred shorter term tactical decisions as opposed to games where I have to constantly be looking as far ahead as possible. There are definitely far better abstracts than this out there.

RATING: 7
I used to play more seriously, but I don't anymore. Chess's biggest problem is that it degrades seriously in enjoyment if the players aren't fairly closely matched in ability, and improving one's ability is a time- and mental energy-consuming task. But, I'll happily play when people (rarely) suggest it, though I don't go seeking out masters who grind me into little itty bitty pieces.

It is [thing=171][/thing], so, by simple osmosis with mankind, you probably know all about it.

What you could not know is that I rooted for Kasparov against Deep Blue. Now I just don't care anymore.

Anyway, [thing=171][/thing] is not a game I will seek for, but from time to time, I get the urge to play it. However, I usually can quench this by simply playing something else I like more.

RATING: 6
Chess and its cousins interest me but I'm not good at them.

I definitely don't care for the aimless early game and the endgames where a few pieces run around unable to catch each other.

...I want to like chess etc. but it just solos terribly. Invariably I find that I've ignored (as both sides) a huge and obvious opportunity for one side, and that destroys the game. Why? Not just because the current game state should not have existed, but because in order to continue I have to arbitrarily decide which player gets to either take advantage of the opportunity or take action to eliminate it.

More generally chess just has too many moves to evaluate at one time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
For the game, I'd give 5. Fact is that chess outcome is always draw (if players are equal). The winning - losing difference comes from the fact that one side, or other did not scan through (or forgot, while dying in boredom) all information about established moves/counter moves.

Every once and a while, one manages to beat decent chess player by doing something unexpected and borderline ridiculous. In these occasions game can momentarily be fun before player who deviated from The True Way(tm) is quickly beaten to death by community that does not allow anyone to deviate from the Established Truth and Scripture(tm). Hence, due to players being what they are, rating is 2.

In any case, Shogi is much, much better game of this genre.

A classic and maybe the best of the classics. I don´t like too much abstracts, especially when the starting is fixed and creativity and intuition is limeted. I don´t like opening books are a must to play well. It is a so overanalysed game that I don´t enjoy it. My partner hates abstracts (Hive being the exception) so I rarely play it...anyway I can't rate it less because keeps being the king of the strategy games.

RATING: 9.5
This game has a lot of depth and has potential for very counter-intuitive winning moves. I recognise that it is not for everyone, but for those wanting a game that is worth studying and pursuing competitive play it is excellent. I don't think it is the ideal game though, as it is too readily drawn between well matched, strong players and can feel a bit limited. Maybe I'm wrong about that last point, but I feel that the ideal game would involve a little more imaginitive freedom.

El ajedrez es un juego de estrategia abstracta para dos jugadores que representa la guerra medieval en un tablero de 8x8 con luz y cuadrados oscuros alternantes. piezas opuestas, tradicionalmente designados Blanco y Negro, están alineados inicialmente a cada lado. Cada tipo de pieza tiene una forma única de movimiento y la captura se produce cuando una pieza, a través de su movimiento, ocupa la plaza de una pieza oponente. Los jugadores se turnan para mover una de sus piezas en un intento de capturar, ataque, defender o desarrollar sus posiciones. juegos de ajedrez pueden terminar en jaque mate, renuncia, o uno de varios tipos de sorteos. El ajedrez es uno de los juegos más populares en el mundo, jugado por millones de personas en todo el mundo en casa, en los clubes, en línea, por correspondencia, y en los torneos. Entre dos jugadores muy cualificados, el ajedrez puede ser una cosa digna de ver, y un juego puede proporcionar un gran entretenimiento incluso para los principiantes. También hay una gran cantidad de literatura de libros y publicaciones periódicas sobre el ajedrez, por lo general con juegos y comentarios de los maestros de ajedrez.
La forma actual del juego surgió en el sur de Europa durante la segunda mitad del siglo 15 después de evolucionar a partir de un juego similar, mucho más antigua de origen indio. La tradición de ajedrez competitivo organizado comenzó en el siglo 16. El primer oficial Campeón Mundial de Ajedrez, Wilhelm Steinitz, reclamó su título en 1886. El actual campeón del mundo es Magnus Carlsen, Noruega. El ajedrez es un deporte reconocido del Comité Olímpico Internacional.

I have a large collection of Staunton Chess Sets, some antique, some contemporary (Four Bakelite sets, one ivory set, one leaded glass set handmade in 1990 by myself - pictured). I have more than 60 tournament sized Staunton design sets including chessmen of various materials (wood, stone, marble, metal, bakelite, plastic, bone, ivory, etc.), several full-sized chess boards, 4 chess clocks, a fairly large library of chess books and software, including several strong iPhone players. Fritz is running on my PC, iPhone, PS3 and Nintendo DS. Internet Chess Club (ICC) is fantastic!

I have a devotional love for this game.  With the single exception of Go (and, perhaps, Xiangqi)... no other game on the planet ever has evolved such a deep and rich set of tactics and strategy requiring studying various parts of the game's progress (opening, middle, and endgame) to achieve such a widely variable ability rating compared with other players... No other game has established such a worldwide following of players... No other game has such an interesting history in terms of players and tournaments extending back decades (and centuries)... No other game has such a large number of collectors of fine, antique, sometimes rare or unique playing pieces. More books have been written about chess than any other single subject in the history of mankind, and are still being published at a faster rate. There are several libraries on the planet housing nothing but chess books!

I acknowledge the importance and depth of Chess, but I'm just no good at it and would generally rather play something else.

Unfortunately, this means that I can't really rate this game fairly.

Only truely balanced strategical as well as tactical turn-based game around of unparalleled depth; suited for both positional styled stranglers and hyper agressive regicides; playtimes adaptable to taste and ranging from 1 minute bullet to 10-day per turn correspondence modes; easy to learn but still with a steep (that is to say: never ending) learning curve, which is of no consequence to enjoyment, since a multitude of equaly ept or (inept) opponents is available everywhere on the globe for players of all levels, online as well as IRL.

Chess being an abstract game, representing the feudal society at war, its central theme of the King Hunt doesn't make it feel rather the opposite of a "detached" abstract game. Get the men (& Queen!) ready! You too Bishop! Everybody has to contribute, war is coming!

Taught myself Chess as a kid, I used to play a lot during breaks at school and also in school competitions. This game offers strategic planning and meaningful tactical decisions. It always requires you to think far ahead, and requires flexibility to change your plans based on how your opponents moves influence the board. Nowadays I don't play the game anymore (mainly lack of opponents), but I still feel I benefit from what the game taught me when playing other games and in everyday life as well.

*sigh* This game is only alive because of its age and the less intelligent minds of the past several hundred years.

I will admit I liked chess, but then as I played more and more I found there were very specific strategies to employ with no diversion from pattern.  It went from a game of observing and planning, to a game of memorization.  The strategic depth in the modern day I honestly have to say is on par with Pac-Man...

In closing of this short review, there's a reason people are making variant rules to the game, and why the original is timed so harshly.

This is the one that started it all for me.  I've never really made a priority of learning to be a great player, but I love casual games.  I'm not convinced that there is a greater depth of strategy in chess than in other games, but what depth there is is well understood by a cadre of experts who have written extensively on the subject.  So, chess is a rare beast in gaming that rewards formal study as well as casual exploration.  It's a perfect meta-gaming example of "multiple paths to victory"

Hard to rate chess in relation to board games in general, but it clearly has stood the test of time, and is pre-eminately replayable and subtle. However, I suspect many capable players find themselves stranded: the game is most fun when you are well-matched, but casual opponents provide little challenge, and playing competively at the club and tournament level requires preparation - time that could be devoted to actually playing so many other satisfying games.

Yeah, yeah, people rag that it's all about memorization, but really that only gets you through the opening.  You can compensate for memorization, and if you can get the other player out of book, you have a superb game. It's area control and influence in one of its purest forms.  I haven't played this for a long time, but every once in a while I'll go on a chess kick and suddenly everything will become a chessboard:  the dinner table, the freeway, the sidewalk...

A classic that I grew up playing. This game is fun at the amateur level but, unfortunately, it gets increasingly frustrating as you get better. To compete at the higher levels you pretty much have to memorize numerous openings and various end-game tactics. This is why I play board games instead - I get a similar brain-burning enjoyment without all the homework.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A classic for a reason. It's unsolvable, luckless, and combines both tactical and stratgic elements into what is a very compact game. I am pretty decent (not a master), and when playing someone of your own skill level it's the ultimate brain-burner. Just have to find someone equal to your level, otherwise it's not near as much fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Ah yes, the age old classic. Still fun and a good exersize for the brain if played against an opponent of smiliar skill. It is not without failures though as the starting posiitons make getting out you more powerfull pieces hard to do and timeconsuming. Chinese chess offers a similar experience but gets to the interesting part faster on acount of there being fewer peices and a more 'open' setup.

My most played game ever and of course one of my favorites.  The game offers much depth and sometimes makes your brain go crazy!
I like the fact that there are no hidden parts, everyting on the board is open, both players start with the same pieces at the same spot.
It may suffer from downtime depending on the people who play,this can be solved by using a timer.
I also like to have a nice looking chess set in my livng room, bedroom, it's very decorative.
This one should be higher ranked on bgg.

Συγκεκριμένα έχει οκτώ πιόνια, δύο πύργους, δύο ίππους, δύο αξιωματικούς, μία βασίλισσα και έναν βασιλιά. Ο ένας παίκτης κατέχει τα λευκά και ο άλλος τα μαύρα, όπως ονομάζονται οι αντιστοίχου χρώματος πεσσοί.

Ο σκοπός κάθε παίχτη είναι η επίτευξη ματ στον αντίπαλο βασιλιά. Αυτό συμβαίνει όταν ο βασιλιάς απειλείται (αυτό ονομάζεται σαχ) και δεν υπάρχει νόμιμη κίνηση διάσωσης. Ας σημειωθεί ότι το ματ καθιστά την αιχμαλώτιση του βασιλιά περιττή καθώς αποτελεί το τέλος του παιχνιδιού.

I learned from some of my friends back in grade school. No one in my family played so I only got to during rare free time in school.

You have to play with the right people (people that haven't played much tend to do "whoopsy" mistakes and to have a close game you have to not exploit them...tough for me(me=competitive). or those who have all the positions memorized to be good).

I prefer playing those that know the game but don't treat it as a sacred game...tough to do, so many other abstracts are better for me to play...

It has only 6 operators, a small handful of strange additions, and a richness of play. [b][gameid=12608][/b] is an improved version, as there is more scope for creative openings. I don't list chess as `owned' since it is a subset of [b][gameid=12608][/b] (which I give a higher rating). The main advantage, of this particular subset, is that it can be considered a social skill. So many people are familiar with it.

Chess is an abstract wargame released at some point in time by an unknown European game company. Probably from Germany. The game itself is...uh...um...Pardon me. I've just been notified that my comments are not original. The comedy bit about chess being a flawed Euro, has already been done.

A mentally stimulating abstract game, but over centuries of analysis it has become overly formulaic and memorization-based.  Static opening play with non-intuitive mechanics that punish every error. Poor aesthetics.

Or, alternatively, an immensely deep and storied game that I am simply to impatient to study enough to reach a level of enjoyable competency.

I play and enjoy; but mostly because it helps me defend my reputation for intelligence.  Fess up, BGG'ers...

I think I'd actually like chess more if it was less popular. Not because of any kind of elitism or anything, but because it's been studied to death by even a lot of average people. If I play with someone else who doesn't have a ton of experience and/or has not read about strategy, I enjoy it well enough (though not as much as many other 2-player games), but someone who has read even cursory articles about tactics will just systematically break me down, and at that point it feels more like an exam than a game. I mention the popularity because I get the feeling I'd feel the same way about Puerto Rico if most people I play with were tournament players.

Any game that has had this much written about it and has such a high profile cannot be a bad game. And of course chess is not, it is one of the best games ever created.

I think the reason why it is not rated more highly here on BGG (and by me) is that it is a very difficult game to play: it requires a very specific type of intelligence, it has absolutely zero luck and the theme is - well, it is not Race for the Galaxy or Combat Commander is it! I think all of these things makes the people here on BGG uncomfortable, hence its low rating.

What to say about Chess? It's very abstract, very deep, very good. Sometimes more work than fun, but has a sharp clarity that many abstract games lack, most being more incremental affairs (cf. Go or Backgammon). The ubiquity of computers with Chess now is a bittersweet development, one presciently anticipated by Fischer (among others).  I think as a pure "game," Chess960 will gain more and more traction.

Also, I must admit that by far the most interesting part of Chess is the midgame.  Openings can be rote, and endgames can be tedious in the extreme. But it is a great, subtle and yet dynamic game: so much can turn on one move, and yet it may not be apparent until 10 moves later.

Also, I had never played much with a clock, but having done so recently, I highly recommend it.  Great fun.

When I was about four years old, I found a cool old travel chess set in my great granddad's basement.  He showed me how each piece moved and told me that I could keep the set if I could memorize each movement by the end of the weekend.  It seemed like a monumental task at the time, but I earned that first chess set and have been playing ever since.

The key to enjoying chess is just to find somebody that is about at your skill level.  You don't have to devote your life to it.  I play email chess with one of my best friends that now lives across the country.  Great way to keep in touch and keep the mind sharp!

Still like chess - though I'm terrible at it now - I would rank it higher, but honestly, I'm such a weak player I usually don't have fun and my opponent (seeing I'm no competition) usually doesn't either.

I acknowledge the qualities and variability of this deep game but I kind of dislike it because it's the most over-analyzed game in the world, and people take it way too serious. A game should be fun and I certainly don't plan to learn how to memorize a chess board and possible moves and play blind...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Marked as 5.0 - as a normalised basis for other scores.
Chess is great in that nearly everyone knows it, the board is easy to find - but it's very analytic, not what I would call fun-filled, and limited to 2 players.

My Very First Game, ever.

So: I rarely play....

RATING: 6
Like most, I have various chess sets, with a couple being favorites of mine.  

I acknowledge that it's a great, historical game, yet I rate it a 6 purely because of my personal preferences.  I enjoy a game from time to time, but there's many other games I enjoy better.

I don't do well with planning out several moves in advace.  Frankly, I'm just not that good.  I enjoy different chess variants more than the standard chess game.

It's a wonderful game ... I just don't want to play it frequently.

RATING: 6.215
I suspect the appeal of chess is the amount of work and thought that can be and has been put into it.  In some ways, the basic game mechanics are inelegant (lots of different pieces all with their own special rules) but the emergent gameplay is such as to allow many different levels of 'mastery'.

RATING: 6
Own two copies: one is beat-up generic set with plastic pieces, the other is themed after the recent Transformers films with large, heavy-duty plastic pieces.

I haven't actually played this in several years, but it can be very enjoyable when played with someone of a similar skill level. It quickly becomes less and less fun as the skill gap widens, and if the outcome is known before you even begin the game, no thanks.

Given a choice I'd much rather play a "variant" like [thing=6848][/thing].  It uses many similar mechanisms, but adds far more variability and even a small dose of randomness that makes it infinitely more fun to play even when the player skill levels are mismatched.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Classic strategy.  I played mostly as a kid in grade school and middle school and enjoyed it but never got into memorizing opening sequences.  I would rather play other wargames, eurogames, or thematic games now as they are more atmospheric and visually more interesting.

RATING: 7
You really have to play against someone of your skill level, though, as the ability to step through subsequent moves in your mind is a definite acquired talent.  And, someone who can only see 1 or 2 moves ahead will never, at all, EVER win a game against someone who can easily calculate a dozen moves ahead.  Given the right pair, though, the game is brilliant.  Easy mechanics, lots of sets to choose from - so component quality can be very high, lots of 'external' material to reference, definite game flow (clear beginning, middle, and end of match), etc.  Personal favorite aspect is chess 'puzzles', which are GREAT for solitaire enjoyment of the game (perhaps the *only* game I enjoy 'solitaire' for this reason).  In fact, a Chess puzzle app is the only 'game' on my iPhone at the moment.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Hard to go wrong with an ancient classic. Fun and enjoyable so long as you're playing at the casual level (~1 hour games tops) with relatively comparable opponents. I don't consider it a "gaming" game and would never play it with opponents who were willing to play a Euro or Ameritrash game instead.

It's the Monopoly of 2-player abstracts!  Seriously: even as a variant of chess it sucks!

Okay I admit I'm deliberately trying to deflate its bgg rating.  And to be honest, I carry a pocket magnetic set everywhere and I've played it more often, with a greater variety of people, and in more cheap cafes, campus pubs, job sites, buses and beautiful parks than any other game. In a sense, it really is *the* game of my life. Also, it's unqualified fun with Karten Schach (see that rating). 

But tradition and custom shouldn't inflate bgg rating. There are several original abstracts on this site and even classical variants that are far superior to this in design.

THIRD greatest abstract after Go and Shogi.  This is the first abstract game I grew up on, but it's not as absorbing anymore.  I especially didn't like having to memorize opening lines as you got stronger (I "quit" at about ~2100).  Still a great game and classic.

I find games where you can just move a piece back and forth over and over in order not to break up your perfect defensive position to be rather dull. Chess is a great game played against people of the same skill level, but it requires a lot of effort to become skilled at. It's just not for me.

If I were to play this with someone who also has never studied the game, I would find it just a little less fun than [thing=2065]Shogi[/thing] or [thing=2393]Xiang Qi[/thing].  Those games have few or no pieces that can travel the length of the board in one move.  Having to check every bloody piece in [International] Chess wearies me a bit, and reduces my enjoyment of it.
Unfortunately, pretty much anybody I know who would want to play this with me has either studied it, or played it enough to completely guarantee their victory.  I don't mind losing, but I don't have much fun at abstract strategy games when the outcome is a foregone conclusion - yes, even if it were because I won every time.

Things I prefer about [thing=2065]Shogi[/thing] over Chess:
You only have to get your unit to the furthest third (rather than eighth) of the board to promote it.
You can promote every unit except the jeweled general (king), though whether you want to promote a unit will depend on the situation.
Rather than moving a unit, you can place a unit you captured on the board, in your employ.

Things I prefer about [thing=2393]Xiang Qi[/thing] over Chess:
Some of your units may not cross the river into enemy territory.
Three of your units, including the emperor, may not leave the 3×3 palace in the back middle of your territory.
The cannon can only capture by jumping over precisely one piece, which provides tricky ways to block its tricky attack.
Before any moves are made, pieces are already in threat of capture, making every move feel significant.

One of the first games I was taught. Probably typical for a child of Eastern European immigrants. I remember being taught at 4 and losing quickly to my father. I only found out much later that he played at a master level and when I finally was able to beat him in my teens I was super happy. 

Of course, chess is also a game that brings out the worst in people. I remember one game I played with a poser in university who would comment on your play the whole game and then give you his "ranking". Such a tool, especially since he didn't play all that well and was more into mocking others to throw them off their game than to actually focus on gameplay. 

Keeping with tradition, when my kids were 4 I taught them chess. Sadly, they didn't enjoy it as much as I did and rarely played it as they got older. Interestingly enough my son now wants to play my father. Hopefully they'll both get time to do that before it's too late.

Quintessential in: Catch a prey, nothing else counts. Blocking at the rules level (stalemate) is a draw. More deeply rooted in its culture than the other abstracts. Somewhat tainted, but still beautiful. Just see the delicate balance of bishops and knights.

As for computers, hey, I have a grandmaster at home commenting on my games. Smoke that in your pipe.

Chess (as well as Go) hardly seem in the same category as these other board games. Such a great game with such depth. But it's hard to call a game that really only comes into its own after hundreds of plays and a theoretical understanding of the game as something similar to, I don't know, Ticket to Ride.

RATING: 7: In chess, when you lose, there is no question that it is because you sucked more than your opponent.  Chess acts as a seemless vehicle for two people to lock themselves into a contest of mental strength, and THAT is my definition of a game.  PS:  I always lose.

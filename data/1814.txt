Lots of fun to play! I will play this any time.

RATING: 5
Very similar to "The Great Dalmuti," but a little better because of the special cards.  Also suffers from what I call the "Werewolf Problem" -- games going on and on since there is no proper endpoint.

RATING: 4
This one really fell flat for my group.  I don't know why.

RATING: 5
Rather less than average 'filler'. It's probably more fun if you follow the Dilbert cartoons, which I don't.

RATING: 5
We use to play the 'non-IP' version of this when it was called Pond Scum. Fun enough for a standard card game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Obvious a [gameid=929]-variant. The special cards didn't do much to me. More cleverness was required here. I've also seen nearly all the comics on the cards. And yeah ... I'm a more than a Dilbert fan! I'm the Dilbert in flesh!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A good end of evening game, especially if there's some beer around too. :)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is the same as The Great Dalmuti, or the public domain game it is based on (known by various names).  However, the Dilbert cartoons on every card make this game even more funny.  It's a great party game, although technically there is no end.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
i'm close to hating this game.  the actual idea of it being fun is where the fun seems to come from.  rich get richer, GO GET ME A SODA AND THEN SHUFFLE THE DECK HAHAHHHJKHFJASDFD.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
An unremarkable game that is more interesting for its characters than the design.  If kept very light and in the right spirit, it is a fun short card game.  If taken seriously, all the opponents begin to look alot like pointy haired bosses. [GTI Code: TGCL]

Picked this up cheap, but haven't played it yet.  When we play this type of game in our game group, we call it Lowlife, and use a standard deck of cards.  Pretty much just picked this up to augment my game collection.  [Thrift $1.09]

RATING: 7
I like it. The Great Dalmuti is a terrific game, but the theme here really seems to work much better. The additional cards add something to the mix as well.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
I played this so much at age of 16 and later have played Dalmuti and the regular playing cards version, but "the Dilbert cardgame" is for me and my group always the thing to remember warmly. You can spend a full day with the right kind of people playing this and not get tired.

RATING: 7
Branded version of Presidents which I enjoyed.  The Dilbert theme, special cards, and different card counts might make it worth a try.

i was introduced to this game at a con and i only play it at the con still. it brings back great times everytime my friend takes it out, one being my brother passed out under the table.....but that is for another story. quick game/no brainer/beer and petzels......or at 3am.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
The game itself is nothing special, but damn does it keep a night going! Reverse Asshole at it's finest, and the added musical chairs (sans music) keeps everyone pleasantly buzzed. Who doesn't want to be the Big Boss at least once?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Slightly more chaotic version of [i][gameid=929][/i] which is designed for fewer players.  A nice filler game or something to play with the relatives who wouldn't play other games.

RATING: 7
A neat little filler that requires all the basics of good card play. Plenty of theme too.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Unfunny (even if you like the original cartoons) and mind-numbing lack of strategy. But my biggest complaint is to total lack of purpose or objective if played for more than one hand

I spent many months playing this game at lunch time with my entire office IT department.  We had a blast!  Sometimes there were many more players than the game could handle but we didn't care.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I like this version better than the public domain version.  That's partly because there's a set of rules included, so I don't need to think about which ruleset is in use.  And the cartoons and additional powers are fun, too.  Especially good if played in the corporate spirit (with neckties, various types of chairs).  Rating of 6 is based on at least two sessions of play.

RATING: 6
OK, so The Great Dalmuti pretty much sucks (any game with a mechanism that punishes you for doing poorly, especially when it&#039;s mostly luck anyway, is not going to score points with me). You know, though, it&#039;s amazing how much a game can be helped by some funny artwork and a little touch of thematic humor. The Great Dalmuti I can&#039;t stand at all; even though this is the same game, I can play it for 15 minutes, maybe up to half an hour. No more though.

Dilbert fans will like this card game for the humor aspect and the chance to be the PHB.  Quick playing, not too much thinking needed.

RATING: 5.9
OK. You can play this almost exactly (called in my group, "High Life, Low Life") with a normal deck of cards. But the Dilbert theme is good, and the variable numbers of cards of each value (and wilds) are good. So it's enjoyable.

Similar to Gang of Four, Karriere Poker, President, The Great Dalmuti and somewhat similar to Frank's Zoo.

Big raspberry for this game. I'm not fond of it. I work in a big corporation and this is just about the politics in a corp. I can see it's merits, but I don't want to mimic work when I'm playing board games. However, it's easy to learn and seems to be a pretty good social game.

Another Great Dalmuti/A**hole variant.  &quot;Any game which is sufficiently capable of being perfectly replicated by two decks of cards is not worth buying.&quot;-me.

RATING: N/A
Similar to the Great Dalmuti ?
Could probably get a dilbert-themed love-letter out of the cards. (Need to invert order, so lowest number wins.) Or coup, perhaps.
I think the deck is the same shape as 'pairs' so could play that, or any of the others in the 'pairs companion' booklet. http://cheapass.com/free-games/pairs/

RATING: 5
It's the great Dalmuti with Dilbert.  A good light game when you don't care about "strategy" or "winning"
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Very underrated. It's an variant of Great Dalmuti, where the extra cards do improve gameplay slightly. A better intro to games than Carcassone or  Seidler. Perfect for six players.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A new take on an old card game; the animations on the cards are cute, and the abilities on some of the cards make for a fun and quick paced game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Ladder-climbing game with some twists and (as expected) some comedy.  Works pretty well with a bigger group, but doesn't feel as strategic as the more "serious" games in this genre (i.e. Tichu).  Fun, with the right folks (but then again, so is just about any game!)

This is a great card game for promoting a party type atmosphere.  It is a trick taking game for 6 people, but the twist is after each round, players change seats and player order.  The theme is based on the office setting of the Dilbert cartoons and new players always get caught off guard because they are too busy reading the funny cartoons on their cards.

Very fun and plays quickly.  It's similar to a "typical" trick-taking card game such as pitch, but a lot more straightforward and entertaining.  It's not exactly the same as The Great Dalmuti; cards only range from 1-10, and there are a couple special cards (0 and 11) which somewhat favor the players already in power.

RATING: 5
I have owned this since High School(1997ish).  Always a great game and a great alternative to the Great Dalmuti.  Many long nights playing this in college as well.  While still a great game, we usually only get together for a big night of Dalmuti about once a year, which after last years experience, may be over doing it.  Great party game for a large crowd as long as you have room to move around.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Even though it's not much more than a cross between Great Dalmuti and a Dilbert comic, I like it because it lends a nice and silly mood to the gameplay. It's simple, it's quick, and the cards are hilarious.

This is usually an easy game to get people to play.  It is low commitment, and humorously unfair at times.  I like how the outcome of one round affects the starting position of the next round.  One time I was big boss for 15 times in a row.  When I finally got dethroned, my mom said that she felt like everyone won!  

A fun game, and I think I'll always find it fun.

Somehow the corporate/Dilbert aspect makes this game much more amusing than the original version (Great Dalmuti).

Remember to arrange seats properly. Eg. President gets the best chair, VP get the 2nd best. Senior Assistant gets to sit on the floor or on a little bench, and junior assistant must stand and do everything at all time. 

That'd give a good atmosphere of playing this great game.

RATING: 6
It's the Great Dalmuti, but each card has a Dilbert cartoon on it. You need to be a fan of Dilbert, because the captioned cartoons are all extracts from running themes that Scott Adams has had at various times, so the background helps with the appreciation. In terms of the gameplay, it's very straightforward. Rolling trick, play if you can to be the first to discard all cards. The deck is made up of ten 10's, nine 9's ... one 1, plus some wild cards and special quirk cards. If a triple gets led, all plays on this trick must be triples, with each subsequent play using a lower number. Play your worst cards and combos as you can. The decision making comes when you have the choice to keep a good combo for now or for later ... will you need it to win a trick later when cards are depleted and you have a better chance of controlling the trick and going out.

It's ok as a time waster with beer, and the theme allows you to ham it up, but the play is simplistic and too luck prone compared to some of the other great/good rolling trick games like Tichu and Frank's Zoo.

RATING: 10
I Love This Game!  It is silly!  It is funny!  It is easy and quick to learn!  It is Dilbert!  Gameplay is quick.  It is not easy to get your hand on a copy of this game, but if you enjoy The Great Dalmuti and crazy trump card games, you'll want to.  I think the game rules and strategies are easier to grasp than with Bottle Imp, which is also a great game.  For me, Dilbert Corporate Shuffle is a perfect game.

(5  plays) 

Who can play?  Party game for 5-8 players.

This is the old college drinking favorite (President-Asshole) re-done to Dilbert theme.  Perfect theme for this game actually.  This rating assumes large amounts of alcohol are being consumed, and the rules are tweaked a small amount to keep some elements of Asshole in the game. Out of the box with no liquor, take it or leave it.

This is a fun filler game that has been liked by most people to whome I have introduced it. Although the luck of the deal can play a big role, there is definitely a limited amount of strategy in the play to keep the player thinking and keep the game interesting for repeated plays.
It is better than the other two popular climbing games: "The Great Dalmuti" and "Frank's Zoo", the latter being a muddied, convoluted version of this clean game.

This is a fun party card game that is slightly better than The Great Dalmuti.  But it can also be a bit of a pain to play.  Played once as an 8-player game.
This game is not really for me, it is a bit of a dog.

I've always liked scum-peon-high peasant-low peasant-chinese/career poker-Great Dalmuti (SPHPLPCCPGD).  The immediate gratification of winning a hand/combined with lust to acquire power when a hand is played poorly make this game addictive like no other.  The best version of this game that I've played is the Dilbert version.  The special power cards add the perfect amount of spice.  And the cards are funny.

Play the Great Dalmuti instead; It's the same game with different artwork. No need to give Scott Adams any more attention nor money. He is a human piece of garbage.

A good game for larger groups.  It's a re-themed version of the Great Dalmuti, but many people will find the office theme easier to relate to.  And, hey, looking at the Dilbert cartoons on the cards is fun.

A Dilbert theme on the classic "climbing" card game. Not nearly as interesting as Gang of Four or Tichu. Might be useful for bringing non-gamers into the fold due to its familiar license. Sold my copy.

RATING: 7
Another @sshole variant (a game that I like, so I like this game).  Dilbert neither breaks or appreciably enhances the game, although the theme suits it well.  Funny how game geeks are either completely enmeshed in corporate culture (they are usually IT/coding or engineering) or completely outside of it (artists or scientists).  Both sides can appreciate the humor from different perspectives.

Similar to "President" / "Asshole" but with a few minor tweaks to the cards, such as special cards that let you choose a player to be skipped and the number of cards (a lot of weak value numbers and only a few powerful value numbers) Plus you're climbing down instead of up in numbers, but that is a minor issue.

Like Dalmuti, an A##hole clone that improves on the standard deck version.  Where Dalmuti adds cards of increasing rarity and decreasing numbers, Dilbert features cards that alter the rules.

A smaller version of The Great Dalmuti that doesn't quite work.  Frank's Zoo is much, much better for 3-5 players.

The Great Dalmuti with a Dilbert theme.  I find it works for a family group with non-gamers.

Basically it's The Great Dalmuti wrapped up in Dilbert's clothing, but a classic card game sticks around because it has something, and if you like dilbert it's better than playing with hearts and clubs! Great for your poker and crazy 8s crowd

This is a good party game based on The Great Dalmuti.  Once you get to the top, though, it is tough to be toppled.

Corporate Shuffle is hands down the most fun you can have in a game with 5 or 6 players.  The gameplay is complex enough so you don't feel you're just flipping over cards at random.  But the reason to play this game is to make someone your bitch so they can do a stupid dance for your amusement.  BTW, I hate the Dilbert comic and still love this game.

A Dilbert-ized version of WOTC's fabulous Great Dalmuti. Aside from a few specialty cards, no real difference. A lot of fun with a large group.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A dumbed down Tichu and Capitalism with a couple of neat special cards.  However, the fact that you can only play either singles or the same numbered cards together completely limits the gameplay.  Very difficult to climb out of the hole if you don't get decent cards beyond the one(s) you have to pass away.  I don't really enjoy games in which strategic play is rarely rewarded simply because other people have a better hand.

RATING: 5.9
Fun, amusing, pastime-style game, with no ultimate goal.  A good time for the recommended number of players.

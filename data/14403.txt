Great introduction to the 40K setting. Good selections of miniatures and some great plasti terrain plus the complete 40k rulebook, all for 50 bucks. In addition the game is simple enough that even the young ones can learn the basics quickly.

Played through all scenarios.
I have a problem with recording 'games played' - you have to remember all the dates.
Have fudged plays over a time period to one date to get approximate plays up-to-date.

The first starter box I ever owned for Warhammer, my father bought this so that he and I could explore the hobby together. Complete with easy to follow scenarios, Battle for Macragge was a great way to introduce a young mind to a vastly more complicated and immersive experience.

RATING: 5
Only a bargain relative to other GW pricing practices.  Gameplay with the supplied components, per dollar spent, is low relative to most boardgames.  Additional expenses required to enjoy the hobby as intended: many hundreds of $$$.  Should only be bought by those intending to spend hundreds on Space Marines or Tyranids, as a head start on their collection.

I only bought this for the miniature version of the 4th edition rule book.  The Macragge part of this box set is kind of a throw-away, but you can use the minis for Space Hulk if you want to.  The intro scenarios are good for newbies, I suppose.

Great intro set for 40k.  Has intro scenario rules as well as the full rules included, and great miniatures.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
The Good:
This game appears complete. Box is in excellent condition. Most of the parts have been separated from their sprues and assembled. there are still a few bases that need to be attached. None of the pieces have been painted. All game literature included and in great shape.
The Bad:
It appears that one of the space marines has broken off the barrel of his gun; the piece is included and will likely repair well.

Questions welcome
Can take pics

Beautiful terrain set rounds at this edition of the classic 40k skirmish game.

RATING: 7
Latest incarnation of WH40k starter box.  Lots of minis in here, all the dice & templates you need, plus a small-sized but complete version of the main rulebook (has all the rules, but not the fiction).  A stellar value by GW standards at $45.  Nothing you ever buy from them will be this cheap again.  But once you're hooked, it's too late!  =:-)

RATING: N/A
This is probably the best introductory set ever put out by Games Workshop for one of their flagship games.  The programmed instruction method uses a number of scenarios that also tell a narrative of part of the battle.

Man, that's a ton of stuff.  Very un GW-like pricing.  That means this is extremely affordable.

EXCELLENT programmed intro to the rules, one scenario at a time.

RATING: 4
My relationship with 40K is long and convoluted.  In short, what happens is that whenever my interest really picks up, GW immediately announces a new edition is about to come out, so I back off.  I'm tired of chasing a moving target, and while I like many of the minis, I'm far from crazy about the actual rules.  So, I've shelved  40K for now, probably permanently.

I believe Macragge is a ripoff but many others will tell you it is the best way to get into the game.  You should read comments on the main version of warhammer 40k before buying.

Not rated yet, as I've really had no chance to play truly yet.  Tried a couple of solo plays to learn the feel of the rules, then dove into painting minis...  :)  Will try to readdress and rate this if (and when!) I even actually get the chance to play. (This entry will be used for many of these similar games!)

Further update.  I'm giving the "full game" a seven (7).  Using our own set up and objectives, all the figures plus some from Space Hulk and a few Tyrannids I bought, it's great fun.   Yes, it's a dice fest, but there is some tactical decision-making required.

Update based on further play.  The missions are specifically designed to teach rules one step at a time.  While this is a good way to learn the rules, the missions themselves aren't great.  You'll really need to get at least the Tyrannid Codex and a couple of Synapse creatures (like Broodlords and Warriors) to fully enjoy this.

Initial rating based on play of the first two scenarios.  Fun game that makes an easy introduction into miniatures for younger/inexperienced players.  Programmed instruction has some oddities, with some rules not introduced until later scenarios that may make more sense earlier, and some restrictions on players for play-balance (Space Marines not shooting at spore mines in scenario 2).

RATING: 8
Better as "stand alone" game (using it without anything else) than V3 previous box as then army are quite differents: long range shooting Marines vs close range (gaunt) and combat (genestealer) Tyranids.

Aquila shuttle wreck, infestation marker,... are better than previous 2 wall corners and palmtrees.

The missions doesn't need any additionnal minis so you can really play out of the box, but still expend it.

RATING: 6
Was the last version of 40k I bought until I lost interest in 40k for years. The units included are rather lame, but the crashed shuttle terrain was awesome and I still have it. It did have some cool scenarios though, and I even bought the Battle Rages On which provided additional scenarios. But I guess I wasnt crazy about the Tyranids either.

Bought this one a few years back and have yet to play it.  Nice value though, the figures and terrain are great (it's citadel, what do you expect?).  You get the normal 40k rules in a small book, plus a simple introductory campaign using a stripped-down version of the rules.  I played 40k a few times back in the day and really liked it.  This is a good set to buy if you want to give Warhammer 40k a try but don't want to invest what you'd normally have to.

RATING: 6
I am a Warhammer Fantasy Battle vet.  I own close to 1000 models for that system.  But I could never really get into the sci-fi world of 40K.  Maybe it was the rules / they are quite a lot different than fantasy.  Maybe it was my dislike of all things Trek growing up... Who knows??

Yeah, I own Epic and have lots of mini's for that (it once was cheap, cheap, cheap) but there was something about the full scale version that turned me away.  

Until now.  

Battle for Macgragge is wonderful.  It has six scenarios which slowly introduce you to some of the rules in W40k. If you thought Battle Cry or Memoir 44 were fun you can't go wrong picking this up as well.  

One caveat: If you get hooked on miniature gaming get prepared to spend lots of moola!!!  In my opinion, there is nothing quite as nice as a cabinet or shelf full of nicely painted figures!

Also own supplement: The Battle Rages on.

RATING: 3
Uhh, where to begin. It takes 2h to sculp the pieces from the sprue (and to clue them together). The introduction book & rulebook have errors and are not too well made. Basicly you have to buy more books to be able to play (and more armies with high prices). Tyranids are boring to be played (with or against). -> Wasn't fun enough for the trouble.

RATING: 4
Good set to begin to paint... but it isn`t my favourite type game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While a nice starting point for the hobby of Warhammer, the gameplay itself is rather dull and unbalanced. Miniatures are nice, and you get quite a bunch + nice wreckage, a small-sized rulebook and gaming aids for a decent price (compared to other GW product, that is). But, you won't be needing that now that the 5th edition is on the wake... Personally, this package has an emotional value for me, because it introduced me to the Warhammer 40K, which is bleeding great!

This was my first jump into minis painting and the GW world.  Approximately 50 hours spent over 2 years getting everything cut from sprues, cleaned, primed, painted, based and clear coated.  All done before play. (Probably more like 60 hours) 

As of Sept 09-I have finally completed painting   

***Finally tracked down "The Battle Rages On" book. Has additional scenarios that were additionally printed online.

I'm slowly adding pieces to play out the extra scenarios that were available online. I also have the HTF extra scenario book in the box now. This was made from some online scenarios.

Not a fan of 4th ed. 40k rules.  But this starter set has programmed scenarios that are excellent as a boardgame unto itself.  Two small forces plus dice, nice crashed spaceship terrain and basically everything you need to play the scenarios provided.  Pretty fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
This is basically a mixture of D&D lore-nerdiness + modeling + a miniatures game. You move around your army units using terrain and movement rules and then check for LOS and range, shoot, roll a bunch of dice, see if you hit, etc. But the units require assembly, painting and detailing, they come in 1000s of fiddly, expensive kits and you need to invest in a library of books to understand how to use them...and if you don't know the 10000 year history behind your units, you will be mocked and shunned by the warhammer grognards. The *game* part of it is actually kind of fun...but the sheer size of the game makes it difficult to find somewhere to play, challenging to transport and the people that will generally play it with you are socially retarded to such an extreme degree that it sucks all of the fun out of playing the actual game part.

This is a perfect introductory set for anyone looking to learn 40K.  It has a good amount of minis, the scenarios teach the rules at a good pace, and the price is really good.

Too bad they don't tell you that you'll need to spend another $800 to complete the two armies in the box set. 40K is proof that what is popular is not always good (or even interesting). Nice models in some cases, the game itself is hampered by rules that are poorly written and changed en toto every 2-3 years. Great for 12-year-old kids - it's fun watching them argue about the rules down at the LGS.

This game is mostly shooting phase. Lots of cool miniatures, but the gameplay lacks strategy. It's more of a shootout, with strategy mainly involving the cover you take, and what models you put in your army. The rest is mostly a back and forth shootout.

Also looking for any of the latest Space Wolves miniatures and/or big Vehicles for Space Marines (Rhinos, Land Raiders, Predators).

I'm playing 5th edition so I need as many figures as I can get!  I'm also interested in Tyranid (particularly the Carnifex and Hive Tyrants, any bigger Tyranid units)..and Tau figures (any and all).

RATING: 6
Okey intro into Warhammer 40K. They did well by having two different factions with different stats and therefore different playstyles.

They do use a simplified ruleset in the scenarios, which might give a bit of a incorrect view of the units.

The models in the game are nice, well representative of the models you are normally playing with (at the time at least).

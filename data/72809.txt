Just getting into this and very pleased with it. A really interesting addition to the deck building genre. The art is very funny and although a bit over the top, you really do concentrate on the card text and icons in game play, and working out your strategy - it doesn't detract. So, strongly recommended - especially as 2 and 3 player games. Played recently with 5 and there was too much downtime for my tastes.So if you have the money (it's not cheap) then get yourself a copy!

I've now upped my rating to a 9 - there's lots to think about and the strategies are more subtle than Dominion. Two or Three players is definitely preferred.

I would not mind to play it again. The artwork is good and one can't deny is well done to the concept. The gameplay is solid and rewards skill but quite a bit more difficult to get into compared to dominion which it is based on. It also feels a bit long but I feel that could be because I keep comparing it to Dominion but I enjoyed the game while playing it.

Art ... awesome. 
Game play ... mediocre deck-building that has a few too many moving parts for this type of game.
Theme ... WTF?! Look, I like anime. But what in the world were they thinking with this theme. Scantily clad Nazi bimbos? Is this a deck-building game or a sexploitation film?

Fairly good game in deck building mechanic. The game is nicely balance and thematic.

The art have some sexual suggestive that acceptable in the Japanese but too much in other cultures.

RATING: 7.9
Many will be turned off by the theme of this one, which is German WWII anime girls conquering Russian cities, but I'm able to overlook it since it's fictitious, and the Japanese anime/manga scenes have long had a fixation on military girls, uniforms, and so forth. But Barbarossa is a solid deck builder, and the use of Tactics and a Deployment area give it a little more meat on the bones than most of the smoother gateway games in this genre. I'm often reminded a little of Warmachine High Command in how you are battling for the locations. Good artwork, not quite as racy as a Kanzume Goddess or Tentacle Bento.

Rating is from several solo plays to understand the rules and get a feel for the flow of the game.

The cards are over the top, but that's quite all right.  I'm sure there will be those who will ogle the cards, but that just makes it easier for me to beat them to Moscow first.

My rating may rise or fall after the game is played with a full group.

I have been back and forth a lot with this one. I supported the combined kickstarter for this and El Alamein and just barely got myself to stay away from a gamepledge for the Photo-editions. Part of it is due to the anime-version and how I feel about that way of depicting women in games. But I also thought I didn´t have anyone to play them with (I do - they are just not among my gaming-friends - they are in the military bunch). After reading a review I once again find myself on the side of wanting to own a photo-edition of this.

RATING: N/A
My favorite quote on this game: "... it's just the right amount of bat-shit crazy that I've come to expect of the Japanese." Possibly as politically incorrect as the game itself, but there you go.

People seem to be getting exercised about this one. Offensive, what-the-hell-are-you-doing-with-Nazis, sexist, etc. I just can't do it. I mean, to my Western eyes the game is clearly absolutely crazy. Completely nutters. Absolutely divorced from any realty I have any familiarity with. It's hard to get past that to being offended by the historical treatment or the art. I mean, the producer was insane. It makes any further criticism difficult.

For me, it mixes too many kinds of crazy. If it was crazy on  fewer axes, or if I was 20 years younger and if all my friends were sociopaths, I would almost certainly enjoy playing someone else's copy from time to time for its train-wreck fascination. In the reality I have a passing acquaintance with, not so much.

Some BGG users seem to be overreacting about alternate history and anime girls. If you know Japanese gaming history, alternate history games are everywhere; numerous Japanese war games with cute girls were realised. I just can't see offense in this game.

The main problem is the balance of cards. Some cards are too weak and there is not enough player interaction for an otherwise interesting Dominion variant.

RATING: 8
The game took way too long than it needed to, but we were prepared for that, and future plays should go much more smoothly.  This is such a phenomenal game.   There is so much going, and so much to do with your cards that even with my loss I was excited to see what else I could do.  The gameplay is a lot more simple than it at first seems, and future plays will be more about what is worth giving up to gain something else.  Plus quite a few take that cards to make your friends really hate your guts.  There is a little too much luck in how you battle the cities, and the art is less than tasteful, but there is an amazing game in there.  I kickstarted the stock tank photo versions of this and El Alamein.  I couldn't justify also buying the Anime version of El Alamein, when I know it will never get played, just because of the art.

Players recruit elements of the German army, and try to conquer Russian cities during World War II.  One of the more unusual deck builders out there, where players begin with some measly supply cards, and a couple of Grenadier regiments, and must construct an army that will take cities all the way up to Moscow.  It's now fairly typical deck building stuff, ramp up your economy (supply), purchase more valuable units, all the way up to Heavy Tank units, and send them into the cities.  Cities, as well as some of the Russian units defending them, are worth victory points, which are totaled when the game ends (fall of Moscow).  I thoroughly enjoyed the game, and thought the theme and mechanics meshed really well.  This game is closely related to Tanto Cuore, in that you can get units out of your hand and onto the table (the front line), where the actual fighting is done.  The anime lady panty art is a nice, controversial, hook, but seriously you barely notice it during the game.  Your first game or two will take a while as you learn the cards and nuances, but play time will rapidly decrease.  Very good.

SOLD IT!

In all honesty this game is really a "6", but I felt I had to help balance the "1" ratings which no doubt exist from gamers that hate the theme and have never tried to play it.

I HAD to have this game when I first saw it. I can not deny I am a sucker for any anime games, and as it turned out this is one of the few that actually plays well. I was also lured in by the politically incorrect Nazi theme... I find it refreshing that not every game out there has to meet the approval of the typical family with 2 kids and a dog.

Hell yeah; I want to play the bad guys and look at over-sexed women!

RATING: 4
A repetitive, frustrating and never-ending deckbuilder along the DC Deckbuilder-lines (buy cards with currency A to then play cards for currency B which is then summed to defeat a variable strength boss; repeat), and it just serves to shows how good Dominion(+expansions) and StarRealms really are. Dom and SR are both brief 30-40 min games, but this is a 2hr long boring slog of combo-less, buy-buy-attack-rebuild cycles. Rather than control armies and choose tactics, you play as a  German S-4 Supply officer and have 3 currencies: Supply, Tactics and Attack Strength.  You buy brigades and ensure they're posted up at the front.  A war game this certainly is not.

Barbarossa is much too long with small 4-card hands and not much variety in the way of strategy. Good deck builders should have cool card effects and the ability to play cracking combos.  But here, there's no pondering which card to buy - it's pretty much a case that the more expensive the card, the more attack points it has. The table footprint is twice as big as Dominion as all card piles are laid out (thereby negating variability). With the three currencies, players are racing to try and get their attack cards out to then 'buy' the next city at a high attack price+random number. Either win or lose, the city, they'll then discard an expensive tank card and spend the the next few turns drawing through hands of 4 to get the tank back into play. Even if successful, this process is repeated 12x with everyone utilising the same strategy as Moscow, Leningrad and Stalingrad all very expensive. Around the 60 or 90 minute mark you'll begin missing Dominion's variety.  The B&W photo-edition means all the cards look roughly the same, all black and grey, with very small iconography and text. Overall, most turns there was nothing to do except buy additional supply cards and cycle through one's deck to get the tanks back out. Trashing is rarely possible, there's barely any game variation from one to the next and the game did not include nearly enough hills and 'strategic position' cards (which shorten the game).  Compared to its peers this is too long and too repetitious, therefore a dud.

RATING: 7
Tasteless theme?  Absolutely!  But you can have a game in your collection that may upset the 'edgy' Cards Against Humanity players and be a better game!

Let’s start by appreciating the premise (verbatim): 'The players control fictitious German army division invading a fictitious Russia during a fictitious WWII. The goal of the game is to conquer cities, until finally taking (fictitious) Moscow.'

In all seriousness Barbarossa is a far more interesting alternative to Dominion, as in, it feels like it actually has a point and you are working towards something other than Victory Points.  The shuffled City Cards combined with Events Cards are a nice alternative to Dominions 'buy VP cards.'  Instead you have to have some overhead to deal with a somewhat randomised event that requires you to have overhead, when it is completed there are effects and the event card can be placed in an opponent’s tableau to mildly annoy them temporarily.  The fact you have to maintain an army and prepare to siege a City is one more thing that requires planning.

In short, for all the shit people give this game, if you have burnt out on Dominion and have distaste for the style of artwork (Personally I find the artwork to be what I expect of fan-service anime, ridiculous and funny), maybe try the photo version because in my estimates, this is a better deck-builder, no question.

My only qualm with this game is the small text and iconography on the cards but you can pretty much learn the majority in a game or two.

An interesting Thunderstone clone, just wish it had stolen a little more from Thunderstone and only put out half of the cards instead of everything except one randomly removed set. To much to read with all they cards out there and would play just as well with fewer unit choices I would recomend pulling 8 sets instead just 1 set and that would make each game really different.

Played this with two players and had a great time.  It came down to the last turn as to who would win.  Took about 90 minutes including explaining how to play.  Despite there being little interaction between players, the downtime was not a problem.

Later played it with four players, and the downtime was more noticeable later in the game, but still not a big problem.  It also came down to the last turn with the winner going from last place to first place by capturing Moscow.

Although downtime has not been a big issue, everyone who has played it so far makes jokes about the artwork being there so you have something to do between turns.

The game has actually improved on some elements of Dominion's play, although it takes longer to play and does not have the same level of replayability as Dominion (the latter of which is not as necessary due to the former).

I'm tempted to rate this a "10" to offset the "1" ratings it's getting due to the artwork and theme.  I can kind of understand the artwork (although no one I've shown it to yet has been offended), but I hope those who find the idea of playing the Germans in a WWII game offensive enough to rate this a "1" are giving Memoir '44 the same rating for the same reason.

Despite the temptation, I have not inflated my score.

This game is absurd, is in poor taste, and is offensive in its theme, which led me to expect a terrible game. Instead, I was shocked to find an absolutely wonderful spin-off of Dominion's deck building that straight up worked! I found the variance of the supplies and tactics to be an interesting mechanic, and trying to time when to attack cities was tense. Great game. There is a version without the scantily clad anime girls out there, for those that would prefer more taste in their games. I would consider this game much more a deck builder fun game than a wargame, and it's incredibly excellent as a deck builder. Very deep strategy and many thinky decisions.

I bought it only for the weird crazy theme (Cute Girls + Anime + Nazi + Fetish!), but then I found that Barba*Rossa, as a deckbuilding game, has many upsides to Dominion:

-Better theme and art quality. A great plus for being so politically incorrect.
-Better gaming format than Dominion: standard sized cards and a much smaller box make this game portable.
-More "game" in less cards. With only 300 cards, Barba*Rossa has more depth and card variety than the 500 cards of Dominion.
-More options during play. You have to make decisions not only deciding what to buy, but also deciding how to play and manage your hand.

Great deck-builder with a difference. Unlike some of the comments this is not a "Dominion clone." If you play this game thinking that you are going to lose. Badly. You aren't trying to build an engine with your deck, you are building an army, and that is how you keep the deck lean.
As for the art, it's great but if you are too distracted by it to pay attention to what the cards actually do then you will struggle to do much, because there is a lot of text on the cards, and it often pays to read it to understand the things you can do.

I do hate comparing all deck-builders to their granddaddy, but... Dominion with every kingdom card in play.

And tanks.

It's nowhere near as accessible as Dominion due to its comparative complexity and the length of time your first few plays will take, but it's sufficiently different to warrant a try.

It can feel like a bit of a slog at times, although that should be expected when attempting to invade Russia. And attempting different strategies through different army combinations is a joy, as is watching the plans of your "allies" come apart due to an unexpected Soviet defense.

I bought this game for SCIENCE, as I am researching different card game mechanisms.

So, I have received the game. There is nothing in the cards you could call porn. Basically they are like pin-up girls or bomber nose art, but done in a manga style. Some are edgier than a WW2 pin-up.

If a western company did a game like this and illustrated it with bomber nose art kind of pics, you could pass it off as ironic or something, though onlookers might think it sexist, which I suppose it is, to be truthful.

Done in an anime style, though, it makes you look like a bit of a pervert, owing to the unfortunate associations of anime/manga with hentai porn material.

There's definitely more going on here than in Dominion (a clear source of inspiration for this game). Playing with all cards bar one each game seems as though it's unlikely to prevent any particular strategy working each time, and so I see this as being a much less variable game than Dominion. It also plays for much longer.

I like the theme, and think it's just the right amount of bat-shit crazy that I've come to expect of the Japanese. Unfortunately, I don't think the gameplay is a great match for the theme, as the game is considerably thinkier and longer than such an absurd theme would suggest.

RATING: 8
Deck building game. Sort of mixed Dominion and Thunderstone. Longer, one 2 player game takes us about 1 hour maybe 1 hour and 20 minutes. More demanding then both other ones. I like it more with every play.

All the cards are always up, so you may think that optimal strategy would emerge quickly and kill the fun. Not for us. This is not short game and very strategic. It is important to "invent" how you would like to build your army and then try to execute it. There are many ways of doing this in a good way. You can try with big tanks or a lot of cheap infantry with something in the middle to support it, you can try to make it ballanced. And on the other hand you have remember about your deck which has to be very efficient.Great game...

After more plays we start to find more subtle ways of playing the game. Barbarossa is a GEM. I have thought that El Alamein (which is even better, maybe) will kill our want for plays of Barbarossa but now we play one or another.
One of two best deck-building games out to date.
Very recomended.

I finally got it! :D

It's a pity that it hasn't been translated into English (yet) and, because of that, it isn't popular.

This game is GREAT. It's deeper than Tanto Cuore and it makes you really feel you're commanding an army. Everything that happens is very thematic.

I can't wait to play it with more players. It can be rated even better than Tanto Cuore after that.

Edit: oh yes, it WAS translated! The English version is IN for both Barbarossa and El Alamein (the latter is under production right now).

I totally get the art, and I'm glad they did it that way because it smoothes the horrors of war the photo edition could remind people.

But, for people who don't like the anime art, there's the historic photo edition available out there for you. Stop complaining and play this game.

I'm not so sure trivializing the Eastern Front the best idea.  And why anime style?  But ok, I have had a chance to play and would do so if asked again but will not seek out my own copy.

Ich liebe die verrückten Ideen der Japaner - "Hey wir paaren sexy Anime Mädels mit Nazi-Deutschland". Wer jetzt schon denkt "What the fuck", braucht sich Barbarossa gar nicht erst anschauen - gehen sie bitte weiter, hier gibt es nichts zu sehen. Allen Anderen empfehle ich eine Proberunde. Denn in dem Spiel versteckt sich ein sehr interessanter Deckbuilder mit komplexen Möglichkeiten und vielen Strategien, die zum Sieg führen. Das Szenario ist ein fiktiver/alternativer 2. Weltkrieg. Das wird in der Anleitung auch mehr als einmal betont. Nun gut, machen wir uns nix vor, die Spieler übernehmen die Rolle der deutschen Wehrmacht und wollen Moskau erobern. Das ist das Ziel, wenn Moskau fällt, ist das Spiel vorbei. Doch bis dahein ist es ein steiniger Weg. Typisch für einen Deckbuilder kaufen die Spieler erst einmal neue Karten, nämlich Soldaten und Panzer. Zieht man diese erneut, kann man sie in seine Auslage rekrutieren, dann wandern sie nicht zurück ins Deck. Ist man der Meinung, eine ordentliche militärische Stärke aufgebaut zu haben, kann man versuchen, die aktuelle Örtlichkeit einzunehmen. Dafür gibt es Siegpunkte. Danach wandern alle Karten aber erst einmal wieder zurück ins Deck und der Aufbau, der eigenen Streitmacht beginnt erneut. Das Artwork und die Qualität der Karten sind erste Sahne - typisch für Japanime Games. Wer auf sexy Anime Mädels und Deckbuilder steht und mit dem Szenario kein Problem hat: Zugreifen!

This rating has nothing to do with the look of the game. I got the version with the classic WWII photographs anyway, but it wouldn't have bothered me if I didn't.

My rating is mostly due to the fact that this came from the same company as Tanto Cuore, and both games feel VERY similar, in my opinion. I don't like the graphic design of the cards, I don't like how difficult it is to get anything done, and 4-card hands...really!?

Terrible deck-building game. Avoid unless you're a sucker for anime girls.

Much better than expected given the art.  Really plays well as a two-player game.  Taking hills/strategic positions, recruiting divisions, etc and then using these resources to attack Russian cities all somehow feels right.

RATING: 5
I found this to be an enjoyable game.  A combination of Dominion elements with the boss battles of DC Deck builder.  The downfall for this game over time will be replay ability since the same cards aerate every game.  There is a spiritual successor game, but not a direct stand alone expansion, so you can expand the cards if you do not mind having a crossover of desert and winter themes in the same game.  However, the game has some visual elements many will be turned off to, so be sure to look over the artwork before purchasing to make sure you are ok with it.

After unpacking the game, it looks quite fun. The theme is over-sexualized and has minor hints of Nazism. I don't mind, but I can easily see this game looked down upon. Which is understandable. 

I look forward to actually playing it, but man is this going to be a tough sell. If Tanto Cuore is a tough one to get to the table...oh boy.

My biggest issue with these damn games however is the really freaking tiny font used....like REALLY tiny font. I get it, but man it's frustrating at times.

Deck-building game, [thing=36218][/thing]-style, with more complex card interactions. Players are building their decks and try to conquer different cities, with Moscow as the final one. It offers a couple of differences from [thing=36218][/thing] base game, as it brings a new currency in the game, i.e., attack strength, which can be used to conquer Victory Point cards to win the game; furthermore, it introduces "Duration" cards that permanently stay in play until you discard them for a benefit or an attack forces you to do so. Still, I find it very long for what it offers and with not so much replayability (there's just a single trasher!), let alone that there are not enough "Silvers" and "Golds", which makes the game more cutthroat.

The variable strength provinces are a really interesting variation on Dominion. The theme is of course meant to make you feel uncomfortable.

I'd like to think that the theme for Barbarossa came around in a The Producers-like scheme to be as offensive as possible. It’s a Japanese design though, which explains a lot. The artwork is a notch more questionable than [thing=65282][/thing], and would likely raise a few eyebrows anywhere beyond an anime convention hall.

That said, this is an early [thing=53953][/thing] clone which uses dual currencies – one to purchase more cards, and another to capture (completely fictional) Soviet cities. Which is fine really, given my appreciation for Thunderstone, but there are several things here working against it. One is that the game takes too long to build up – the 4-card hand size is frustratingly small, and there is a [thing=36218][/thing]-esque constraint on the number of cards which can be played in a turn. Computing the attack value is also fiddly, as there are deployed cards which may be discarded for an attack boost. And as players don't know the [i]actual[/i] defence of a city until they launch an attack, you can expect long lulls as players optimise their way through attacking.

The last straw is that there just isn't enough variability from game to game. Only one pile of cards is randomly taken out each time, and chances are high that this will not affect how players approach the game. This is a mediocre deck-builder which I’d only play for its completely off-the-rails theme.

Once you get past the artwork you end up with what is effectively a Dominion knockoff, and even then, one similar to Tanto Cuore. Furthermore, the gameplay feels a bit like the DC deck building game, where you are trying to attack a 'boss' cards for big points.

When I play a deck builder, I ask myself 'Would I play this regularly instead of Dominion with an expansion?' In this case, the answer is no. It's not different enough, and quite frankly, my wife would ask too many questions about the artwork. It's neither a bad game nor do I find it offensive, but I don't need to own it either.

I'm not a huge fan of deck builders normally as I feel they lack player interaction most of the time. I picked this one up for its risque nature, and it did not disappoint.

Surprisingly its quite popular with my group though as I said you spend more time playing your hand and passing your turn than doing any player interaction.

RATING: 5
A lot of interesting ideas that ultimately fell flat. The 4 card hand size makes the game unforgivingly tight and slow. I understand that deployed units are supposed to provide you with advantage that carries over into future turns but the whole thing doesn't mesh together in a way that feels smooth. Forcing players to set up contingency plans to account for variability that comes up from the Event deck just makes the game obnoxiously slow. I would house rule the game to make it go up to 5 cards per hand but the entire game is balanced based on the premise that players will have 4 card hands, which would lead to various other problems. Thunderstone Advance is a superior implementation to most of the concepts present here. The only thing it really doesn't have that Barbarossa does is the permanents.

RATING: 7
I bought the game for its weird "if Nazi Germany were populated entirely by cute anime girls" theme without much thought for the gameplay.

Somewhat ironically, I now find the card art distracting and wish it were blandly thematic. Barbarossa is a great Dominion clone with a World War 2 spin -- manage your supply chain, recruit units and take those Russian cities. (Just try not to get caught in the winter!)

Deckbuilding game. Awesome gameplay with an interesting theme.

My rant for people knocking the game for it's theme:
The Nazi references do not bother me because there are none. There's plenty of iron crosses and eagles, but there aren't any swastikas. The Hitler character is named Adolf and the SS are just a unit type. In this regard, it's just like playing Axis and Allies or any of the billions of other World War II based games.
If you still think the game is a disgrace for making fun of a dark period of history then Colonel Hogan and Quinton McHale would like a word with you.
If you're going to rate the game, then please do so based on gameplay.

Despite the awful setting and artwork this is actually a pretty good deck-builder. It's strength is that it feels thematic.

Loosely described as Dominion with a point.
Whereas Dominion has you buying cards in order to buy other cards to win, this has you buying cards & then choosing between keeping them in your deck or using them up in order to attack cities to win. 
So there's not only the extra layer with why you buy the cards, there's also one with how you use the cards.
The art may put some off but it shouldn't detract from what is a very good deck-builder underneath.

 With this game it can have a runaway situation. My biggest shoe that I have with that is some of the cards especially with the specialty deck it tends to give one player a major advantage over the other. It's still fun game and it is my favorite deck builder so far but it has it's problems.

Update: A decent thematic war-themed deckbuilder, which happens to have very daft art... Better than Tanto Cuore and carries its theme very well. The war theme, not the Nazi schoolgirl theme...

Barbarossa vaults across the offensiveness event horizon, with its Nazi schoolgirl knickers showing, and veers into 'so absurdly inappropriate that it's kind-of funny'...

It's the cute horrific mix of anime girls with possibly the most bloody military conflict in history. Sort-of 'why did anyone do that? What were they thinking? I can't actually believe this exists'.

As a board game collector, I had to own a copy...

Taking the Dominion mechanism and adding it onto a game where you use your deck to get out a front line and use it to battle the city deck (the VP cards). At first I thought this took too long, but it doesn't, once you get used to it. The first go takes about 2 hours, but before you know it you're down to 1.
Little card variation makes each game less variable than Dominion, but there are a lot of different strategies to work out.
Art is a bit over the top, but if you count it as war plane nose art, it's nothing to fuzz about. I stopped caring after a while; the game is better than the art.
That said, however, I think the sequel El*Alamein surpasses it.

RATING: 9
The photographic version of Barba*Rossa, containing all (or almost? Don't remember) promos.
Being a bit anti the semi-porn art of the standard version, I was surprised to find myself a bit non-enthusiastic when finally seeing this version. The black and white photos makes the cards look bland and "all the same". You have to look twice to see what card you're holding; the visual recognisation isn't as quick. Also, the real visual makes the theme feel really grim.
That said, the game is as solid as the standard version. For those who downright dislike colourful erotic anime art, this is it.

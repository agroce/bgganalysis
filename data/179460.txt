RATING: 6.72
Many errors/inconsistencies in the game, that take the part of the joy away. The game is still playable though, once you understand how things work, and you don't pay attention to every single detail. Colorblind people may have issues identifying the colors, due to the extensive use of green-red colors in wooden cubes and colored cubes printed on the cards, without a text near them. 

Detailed analysis of score: (Personal opinion)
-Concept of game: 9/10
-Gameplay: 8.5/10
-Mechanics: 9/10
-Futureproof: 8.5/10 (how easily can the game be upgraded with expansions)
-Care for colorblind people: 0/10
-Rulebook writting and rules: 2/10
-Attention to detail by the designer(game concept only): 10/10
-Attention to detail by the company (prior to release, internal test proofing, reading of the rules/cards etc): 2/10
-Company's response to correcting errors: 9/10
-After-sale service: 10/10
-Overall taste until now: 6/10

Total score: 6.72/10

Best part of the game: The board and the concept/design/mechanics.
Worst part of the game: Rulebook, tiny cubes, colorblind issues.

RATING: N/A
Absolutely fantastic. Ignacy Trzewiczek does it again, bringing theme before mechanics but managing to build a very solid game around it nevertheless. The hourglass mechanic is inspired and can really leave the defender flat-footed if they don't prepare well.

You really do feel like shoring up for the last stand against an unstoppable hoard in this one. Balance is set slightly in favour of the attacker, in the sense that a single mistake could likely lose you the game as the defender, but that just adds to the tension.

The random elements are perfectly implemented just right so that you don't feel like a lucky hit was a cheap move but rather a bold gamble that paid off.

Επικό παιχνίδι πολιορκίας για 2 άτομα. Ο ένας λοιπόν προσπαθεί να σπάσει τα τείχη και να μπει στη πόλη ενώ ο αμυνόμενος προσπαθεί να κρατήσει άμυνα για 7 γύρες.

Καλή ποιότητα παραγωγής και ωραίο artwork αλλά εντόπισα κάποιες αναντιστοιχίες στα ονόματα των κτηρίων και στις κάρτες ενώ υπάρχουν παραλείψεις και στους κανόνες. Οι κανόνες είναι γενικά καλογραμμένοι και πολύ καλύτερα δομημένοι σε σχέση με το μπάχαλο της πρώτης έκδοσης αλλά και πάλι όταν βγαίνει μια δεύτερη έκδοση περιμένω να μην υπάρχουν πλέον λάθη.

Στο παικτικό κομμάτι το παιχνίδι είναι εξαιρετικό. Ο επιτιθέμενος έχει κάποιες κάρτες με τα διαθέσιμα actions τα οποία κοστίζουν resources και χρόνο. Με το που κάνει ένα action αμέσως παίζει ο αμυνόμενος που παίρνει τα time tokens και τα μοιράζει στα δικά του κτήρια προετοιμάζοντας έτσι την άμυνα του. Το παιχνίδι έχει αρκετό replayability καθώς δεν παίζουν κάθε φορά όλες οι κάρτες του επιτιθέμενου. Έτσι κάθε μάχη είναι διαφορετική αφού άλλα πολιορκητικά μηχανήματα θα μπορεί να κατασκευάσει. 

Στο παιχνίδι υπάρχει μεν μια μικρή δόση τύχης (κυρίως στα αν θα βρουν στόχο οι πολιορκητικές μηχανές) αλλά δεν πιστεύω πως επηρεάζει τον τελικό νικητή. Αυτός που θα παίξει πιο έξυπνα θα κερδίσει. Μου άρεσαν τα ωραία meeples για τους τοξότες και πολεμιστές, αντιθέτως τα κυβάκια που αναπαριστούν τα γκόμπλιν,ορκ και τρολ είναι τα πιο μικρά που έχω δει ποτέ σε παιχνίδι. wtf? γιατί δεν βάλαν κανονικά κυβάκια?

I enjoyed playing this game for the most part, but kept thinking that something was missing. It felt like most of the decisions the players were making don’t have very lasting effects and there is almost no opacity to any of the actions. On top of that, the fact that there is very little randomness in the game just means the game simply cycles back and forth between the players with very little progress ever being made to either side. There is a bluffing element to a few of the actions which did provide some much needed uncertainty to the outcome of some of the fights, but the actual decisions players make during the game did not feel meaningful enough to keep my interest for very long.

Played this game at BGG Con.  I really want to like this game more than I currently do, but the rulebook holds it back considerably.  We spent a full hour flipping through pages just trying to find answers to inconsistencies we found, only to find no answer exists.  If the rulebook gets an update, I could easily see this score going to an 8 or 8.5.

I wasn't the biggest fan of this and ended up trading it away after 1 play. It wasn't too bad and the rewritten rules are much better than the first attempt, but I just found the gameplay to drag a bit. There are lots of little rules and components and overall I am finding that I like Ignacy Trzewiczek's designs in principal., but I actually don't really enjoy playing them.

First impression, this is a major improvement over the 1st edition: cleaner, tighter, more elegant, faster-playing, much more interesting for the invader. The question for me going forward is if the balance is good; seems tough on the defender now, but hard to say after one game. Just played once so far, but really enjoyed.

Even though I quite enjoyed the game, Portal as a publisher is totally maddening for two reasons. Firstly, they insist on constantly using idiotic, tiny, unreadable fonts. Good lord, WTF is up with these fonts? Could you use something that people over 30 can read? Secondly, even though this is a 2nd edition and a pretty straightforward game (by the standards of its peers) the rules and card texts continue to be pretty shitty, another bete noir for Portal. This could be a translation issue; not sure, but I suspect it's just sloppiness and inantentiveness.

Ignacy is brilliant. The concept of the choices made by the invader giving the defender more or less "time" to prepare their defenses- wow, mind blown. The game is fun, and not complex once you get through the bear of a rule book. I like the reactive play style- especially as the defender as it makes thematic sense. My one complaint is the double sided player reference sheet- would have loved one each for the defender and invader accordingly.

Stronghold is a great asymmetric medieval wargame ressembling an unlicensed recreation of the siege of Helm's Deep. The invader player commands an everlasting army of goblins, orcs and trolls aiming to break the fortress walls with the aid of siege machines and cunning shamans, while the defender is trying to hold on for seven rounds (until Gandalf arrives...?) by any means possible. It's a game with minor luck incidence, in which every single move and decision feels fairly critical, but yet the fact that the invader receives a randomized set of available actions during setup and the fair amount of bluffing prevent it from being too scripted. Really enjoying it so far as a thinky 2P game with a non point-based win condition.

Stronghold is a two-player game telling the story of a siege. Players take opposing sides: one has to defend the stronghold, and the other has to break into the castle as soon as possible. The game board represents the stronghold itself as well as the surrounding terrain, where enemy forces are placed and whence they proceed to the walls.

RATING: 6
A cool thematic two player siege the castle game that provides an interesting asymmetrical gameplay experience. It feels like there might be a dominant strategy with the invader side and massing red cubes but more plays would determine how the balance is. Rules heavy and online videos of the setup and rules help fill in the blanks that the rulebook has.

I neer played the original version of Stronghold. I've always liked assymetrical play and I saw a lot of people playing it in Essen 2015. I didn't have the opportunity to play it there, but almost a year later I managed to get a copy of it and I didn't regret it. A deep and involving game that I enjoy when I play either the attacker or the defender.

A much cleaner re-boot of the original Stronghold game.  Very nicely produced and a nice asymmetrical two player game.  Game player feels a little off - very cat and mouse and doesn't really impart the feeling of a fantasy siege.    In the usual, unfortunate Portal fashion, it seemed to take 3 drafts and lots of volunteer Geek work to get the rules finished post-publication.  Sold on before the rules were finished.

The rulebook is, as many others have said, a dumpster fire.  It's like it was translated twice, by people fluent in neither English nor Polish.

However, I am rating this game on its gameplay, not on its crappy rulebook.

It's so thematic and epic!  Very fun with multiple plays, and short enough to play as each side every time the box is opened.

I think some dude said it took five hours?  I don't know about that.  My very first time playing, with neither player having even heard of the game, took two hours.  Subsequent games haven't gone past 60 minutes.

Really enjoyed this one and it was actually a pretty tense affair up until right at then end when I was sure the invaders were about to break through only for me to just squeak by holding them off, another turn and my castle would have crumbled. Really interesting and really good fun.

The board here is less cluttered and everything has been cleaned up and streamlines, especially the rule book which was pretty awful for first edition, little frustration however it that there is only 1 reference card which is double sided. One each would not have gone amiss.

Much cleaner and sharper (and more fun) than the first edition. Also the components are much better.
There are a few clunky mechanisms I don't like (such as marauders) and the language dependency annoys me but over all the gameplay is pretty good.
The rulebook is not really good and it should be revised.
The special cards (Invader Objective cards and Defense Plan cards) feel tacked on and unnecessary, so I don't use them at all.

Nagyon-nagyon tetszett az első kiadás, csak annyira imbalanced volt, hogy értelmetlen volt vele játszani. Így nagyon vártam a javított kiadással való játékot. Hozta is ugyanazt az élményt, ami az elsőben annyira megragadott. Ami viszont öt éve nem tűnt fel, most zavart: a játék nagyon hosszú volt, és nagyon fárasztó. Ráadásul értelmetlen számolgatással megy el az idő nagy része, mert minden mozgatás előtt ki kell mindkét félnek számolnia a falak aktuális állását. Ez kb. a játékidő felét elviszi, ami nagyon nem jó. Jó lenne erre valami app, vagy legalább valami számláló, amivel inkább folyamatosan számon kéne tartani, mint feleslegesen számolgatni újra-meg-újra. Sajnos ez nekem sokat rontott az élményen.
A kiegyensúlyozottság egyértelműen sokkal jobb lett, de az továbbra is biztos, hogy a védőkkel sokkal egyértelműbb a játék, mint a támadókkal. Érzésre azért lehet nyerni már a támadóoldalon is, de nem nagyon szabad hibázni. :)

Interesting game where you need to manage your resources tightly. One concern was that the game was long. I'm happy to say that this is not the case. A second concern is that you need to do a lot of calculating, hope not, we'll see.

UPDATE
Second game in. Things went very differently this time. As the defender I was able to hold out for the entire extent of the game to victory. 
The game lasted 4 hours, so it was longish, but there was a lot going on, so I really didn't mind. What I'm not bought on is that in the end this is a pretty mathematical risk taking exercise, as the defender you get to see all that the attacker does and then you can make educated guesses at where he will make his decisive move, and try therefore to do something about it. 
A game of 'plugging holes' of sorts, which is thematic in a siege setting, but only if you take the most boring aspects of what sieges are, and that is exercises in mutual attrition. 
Maybe it will be more entertaining to play as the attacker, hoping for the attacker to make a crucial mistake and being frustrated when your troops get quagmired at the wall. 
This looks like one of those games that have a very steep learning curve. I wish to play the attacker soon, now that I have understood how the defender works.

After one playthrough, I'm amazed at the emotional aspect of the game. Playing as the invader I felt really excited about moving my units and devising ways to keep them alive long enough to reach the castle walls. It seemed like I had so many options to choose from to build my strategy. It was fun.

The friend who played as the defender, on the other hand, said he felt the tension and desperation of defending a castle with limited resources and limited time. The seriousness of the situation really helped immersion.

The mechanics are maybe a bit too complicated for some people - unless you don't mind reading the rulebook twice and watching a 40-minute explanation video, maybe don't buy this game. But the game is so worth the time investment in my opinion.

The one thing I'm sad about is that you can only play with 2 people (I read that the original edition had a 4-player mode). And I'm hoping to see expansions some time soon!

Great asymmetric gameplay as one person controls the hordes of goblins, orcs, and trolls trying to breach the castle and the other person tries to prevent that.

The action selection on the attacker side is interesting as the more actions you do the more time you give to the defender to prep. The time mechanic really gives you that feel of crunch time as sometimes you can see the attackers preparing and other times you have to scramble to shore up your defenses.

Components are great although the enemies are represented as small cubes but these cubes are just a little too small for my tastes and easy to knock around and drop.

Stronghold 2nd edition is a wonderfully original game that captures the general feel of a castle siege admirably. The back-and-forth mechanic keeps the tension high throughout the game. The Invader must plan and execute their actions with precision to maintain pressure on multiple fronts, while the Defender must respond with equal efficiency​ to avoid being overrun. The variety of siege machines, equipment, action cards, etc. offers high repeat playability, and the artwork and components are excellent. An enjoyable game that delivers exactly what it intends.

(A disclaimer worth mentioning: This is not a military simulation game. It is a light, abstract euro in a fantasy setting. Therefore, it doesn't attempt to reflect the realities and details of historical castle sieges. This might prove disappointing for some who bring these expectations to the game. Caveat emptor.)

Hirtelen nem tudnék ennél tematikusabb játékot mondani. Miközben meg nagyon tervezős, nagyon számolgatós. És sajnos nagyon hosszú. De nem éreztem azt a 3,5 órát, gyorsan elrepült, csak ritkán van lehetőség erre.
Iszonyatosan hangulatos és kimondottan látványos az egész, és bár sok a szabály, maga a játékmenet mégsem túl bonyolult. A védő idővel való gazdálkodása zseniális.
Elsőre azért kicsit nehéz átlátni, hogy mit miképpen kellene felépíteni, és úgy tűnik, a támadónak nehezebb a dolga. Nagyon szeretnék vele többet játszani, de nem tudom mennyire tud majd előkerülni.
Élményre simán 10-es lehetne nálam, de az, hogy minden kis szabályrészletnek utána kell olvasni valahol máshol, mert nincs benne a szabálykönyvben, az azért lelombozó. És persze a játékidő...

The game board represents the stronghold itself as well as the surrounding terrain, where enemy forces are placed and whence they proceed to the walls.

The defender has a small number of soldiers manning the walls, while the invader has an infinite legion of attacking creatures. A desperate fight takes place every single turn. The invaders build war machines, equip their soldiers, train them, and use black magic rituals to achieve victory. Meanwhile, defenders repair walls, build cannons, train soldiers, and do everything they can to hold the castle as long as possible.

Rating based on 2 players.

Very tentative rating, as I have a feeling this could either rise or absolutely crash in my ratings, depending on future plays. It's a very interesting theme, with lots of options (it's overwhelming at first), and a good amount of things to think about and tense decisions to make. The extra cards provide a lot of variety as well.

However, it is on the fiddly side, it's long, and very heavy as almost everything is deterministic (there is some randomness in the siege machines and some bluffing to make it non-perfect information, though). My main issue is that it feels like the game has a definite tilt toward the defensive side (keeping in mind I played, and lost, as the invader), and the defense seems to have a lot of "cancel" actions which kinda makes the long-term offensive planning feel a bit fruitless sometimes against simple and immediate defensive actions. Don't get me wrong, this feeling may go away with more experience and better offensive play, but this brings me to another potential problem with this game: it is very difficult to teach (impossible for me, personally) and the rulebook is very poor for learning how to play, so it will be hard to get out often.

Sold. When I thought about the effort I'd need to go through the rules again for this I realized I'd rather play other games.

Every mechanic is incredibly thematically integrated, from the hourglass system to the fact that siege engines become "better" the more times they miss.  Since playing invader is more proactive than defender, it initially feels more interesting to me.  Defender is just... stressful.  Which can be a good thing in a game.

Its only downfalls are the fiddlyness (those cubes are way too small) and the amount of calculation required for every wall.  However, the calculation becomes quite fast once you get used to it.  It just means that the game is a bit more draining than most.

Full Game Review available in game forum.

Stronghold is a complex, deep, tense game of decision making. One of my criteria in what makes a game great is when each decision is critical, and Stronghold does this masterfully. If you like games like Star Wars Rebellion but are looking for a little more depth of gameplay, Stronghold is for you.

The rating keeps climbing. What a game.

Excellent 2p game for gamers who like thematic games and wargames with relatively low luck.

Stronghold is an asymmetric game which plays quite differently for each of the two players.  The Invader sets the pace of the game and has the initiative.  In order to win, the Invader must breach the walls on or before turn 7, otherwise the Defender prevails.

The Invader has a set of tools to accomplish this:  siege machines, siege equipment, magic and a never ending stream of reinforcements (well, never ending in the context of the game and 7 turns).  Long term planning, deception and bluffing are key elements and critical to Invader success.

The Defender is far from helpless and has their own troops, weapons, devices and devious ploys to stop  the Invader, or at least hold out until friendly reinforcements arrive at the end of Turn 7, lifting the siege.  The Defender is mostly reactive to the Invader actions, but must be precise and efficient in countering Invader actions to maximize their chances for survival.

The asymmetry, variability of game setup, and the combination of strategic and tactical play in this game makes it a winner in my book.  

The rules and FAQ could be far better, but that is really the only substantive complaint I have regarding the game (not factored into my game rating, but almost enough to lower the rating by "1" point from my pov).  If you read the most current rules, the FAQ and selected BGG rules forum threads, you should be good to go (yup, a bit of work and time...).  The game in play is less complex and fairly easy to play in practice imo, due to the strong integration between the rules and theme.  I like the artwork as well and believes it supports the theme well.

Could increase the rating to a "9" contingent on future plays when I have further experience to assess the balance of the game (slight tilt towards Invaders?).

Looking forward to the Undead expansion.

Like the theme. Cool board. You really get the feel like you are trying valiantly to fight off attackers, or scrambling to break in. 

Seem a bit weighted in favor of the defenders, but only played twice. Plays a bit long at around 2-3 hours with teaching time included. Probably won't get to the table as much as I'd like because of that.

I never played the first edition, but I was really surprised at how simple this game ended up being. The rule book wouldn't make you think so though. It's not that it's bad, but it's not written in a way that allows you to learn the game just by reading through it. I enjoyed Stronghold, though I guess it wasn't as action-packed as I was hoping for. It seems like this game is one of opportunity and slow buildup. Either there is going to be an anti-climactic, all-of-a-sudden victory for the invader, or it's going to come down to a big fight on all sides to see if the walls can be broken through. I really appreciate the fact that this game has deterministic combat, but I almost wish that there was just a little more uncertainty to it. Still, this is a game that should be admired at how well it simulates a castle siege in a more Euro-friendly fashion.

RATING: 3
Okay game, but takes way too long to play. Five hours for first game does not promote interest in a second game,   Even though I won as defender. Cant see it getting to the table more than twice because of this. Is $60 worth two games? Not really. Rulebook could also be better. Adjacency rules and lines of fire very confusing without proper visual chart,  which is not included in the rulebook. What is with the surge of reprinted games that have art that is worse than the original? This, vinhos second edition...bad art design can really kill enthusiasm for a game. When will designers realize this?

Seige tiles are laughable. Looks like someone quickly scribbled the tiny seige machine icons, which all look the same, with a black marker. constantly have to ask "What machine is that again?"  One more game and off to the trade pile.

Only played the first edition once, but this seems indeed more streamlined then the first edition as victory conditions are quite simple (break into the stronghold or prevent it). There are only 2 complaints from my part: the artwork is maybe more appropriate withthe theme now, but it's ugly and sort of gives you a depression when you look at it. The second complaint is: they upgraded the defenders from cubes into meeples, why not do the same for the orcs, even if that would make the game more expensive (it's already in the higher price class, so that want make the difference I think?)?

Nerve wracking game for both defender & invader. We were both unsure who would win until the very last round.  
Very thoughtful move on the creators' parts to include a recommended first time setup for troops, action cards, etc.

-Separate reference sheets for the defender & invader
-Customized troll/orc/goblin shaped tokens for the invader, since the defender has veteran/archer/soldier shaped tokens.

Solid design, that integrates the subject matter rather well, with few, judicious seeds of randomness (a few decks of cards) to allow an other wise arithmetic concept to capture the thrill of a knife-edge balanced struggle. Some minor gamey elements - essentially, traps that keep springing once discovered and race specific cauldrons - detract something from the simulation value, but that is not a decisive flaw to me. Steeper learning curve for the defender, but overall well balanced. Also, I like the teeny cubes (for one thing, they shuffle very well in the bag).

RATING: 6
A good game ruined by terrible and confusing rules. This was supposed to be the streamlined version, but it's still a mess. With information scattered across the cards, rules, and player aid, it was a nightmare trying to figure out how to play. In the end, it was fun, but way too long especially after the lengthy setup. Extremely disappointed.

RATING: 8
So far I'm pretty impressed. The rules have some issues but a "how to" video by that Canadian dude Rodney and the online FAQ clear them up. The game itself seems pretty solid. It's a Euro war game with a very modest pinch of randomness. Very tense for both sides but especially so for the defender. Strategically I am just starting to get a clue what to do. Which feels right; it's a complicated struggle and I don't think the solutions should be obvious. This game will take some growing into. The biggest downside are the tiny little cubes representing the Orcs/Goblins/Trolls. I bought bigger replacement cubes (a giant set of colored plastic learning cubes) and they make me much happier.

1 play, attacker

A cool, asymmetric game that plays VERY differently on each side. The attacker feels like the walls are impregnable, with too few forces that are just sitting ducks to archers and cannons. Meanwhile, the defender feels good at first but gradually sees the rising tide, the crashing wave slowly building to a break. There are a lot of little rules but, mostly, they make sense once you're in the flow of it; and you read the FAQ; and you scan the forums....

Needs more play!

Kiju This is one of those games that merges theme and mechanics brilliantly. Nothing feels gamey. I got the game in Polish so i downloaded version 1.3 of the rules, read the faq and got on with a game. It plays really well and the rule set is fantastic. I have to admit the communication of that rule set i.e the rule book,  could be better. They don't step through the round clearly enough. However the rules do make sense and the game is fantastic even when you are still on the way to figuring the rules out (by round 3 you are over the hump). I might make a set of notes to make the game more accessible to new  players. It really is one of the best 2 player games I've played.

Well, there is some tension in the image of throwing wave after wave of your invaders against the walls, but I have found the actual combat resolution rather unspectacular. Usually, I am not a fan of randomization but here, I think, it would have helped the game. There is too much predictability.
The choice of font is very bad as most text is hardly legible.
There also seem to be quite a few omissions in the rulebook (e.g. are traps and cauldrons spent after use or not?).

Stronghold 2nd Edition seems like a game that was rushed out in the creator's enthusiasm for the original, forgetting that there might be newcomers who want to play it as well. The rules have numerous glaring omissions and shortcomings that make playing an exercise in frustration. It feels as though the manual was bashed together in a single night from memory by someone who's been playing the original version since it's come out. It captures the gist of things, sure, but play the game and suddenly there's a heap of edge cases that simply aren't adjudicated properly. Was this thing ever playtested with people who'd never played any incarnation of Stronghold before? Doubtful, and if it was their feedback was promptly ignored. (In the same vein, whose damn idea was it to print the references for both players on opposite sides of the same sheet of cardstock?)

For this reason I cannot recommend this game for anyone who did not already play the first edition. Don't bother trying to bring new players in; play time will exceed the listing on the box, with at least half an hour reserved for rules lawyering and Internet consultation. I bought this game to play it, not to watch the designer(s) show me how cute they could be with their writing. I find myself thoroughly unmotivated to pick up their upcoming [b]51st State: Master Set[/b] for exactly this reason -- because as someone who's played [b]Imperial Settlers[/b], it's impossible for me to tell what's been omitted from the rulebook before getting a copy, and I refuse to pay Portal for the honor of proofreading their material.

Stronghold would be a 5.7 without this issue.

Nice asymmetric game.  Feels a bit like Star Wars Rebellion in that respect, but some of the features of each side have been shuffled around (for example the invader has a much stronger force pool, like the Empire from Rebellion, but also needs to go around causing trouble in as many places as possible, like the Rebels).

Every game so far has been epic, well balanced, full of hard decisions and it has always been the very last turn, that made all the difference. We still have to see the defender win - however, he came so very close...

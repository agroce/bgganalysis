Don't be intimidatedby the off-putting name ("Domination" or "Focus"): this is a pleasant abstract game. The rules are simple, but building an overall strategy takes experience (and is almost impossible with more than 2 players). The game is still very playable for beginners because they can play tactically one turn at a time. I even played it with kindergarden kids, and have been taken by surprise by some of their moves (that can't be saying a lot of good for me, can it?)!

[b]Spiel des Jahres 1981[/b]

[i]Posted: 6/11/06, Rated: 7[/i]

[i]Focus[/i] is an interesting beast for several reasons, not the least of which is due to its being hard to find these days.  Even under its pseudonym [i]Domination[/i] it can be a challenge to find a copy.  Its strange, octagonal board and goofy plastic Easter egg-looking pieces definitely herald an earlier age of board gaming.  Is this game really worth all of the effort?

The answer to that question depends upon you.  If you are a fan of abstract games, then the easy answer is "yes."  [i]Focus[/i] is an excellent abstract game that can be played with 2-4 players.  This flexibility is a marked improvement over other titles such as the entire [family=10]Project GIPF family[/family].  The corollary to this statement is that you need 1-3 friends who also love abstract games for it to matter.

The game itself plays very similarly to [i][thing=2346]DVONN[/thing][/i]: pieces stack, and in turn the height of the stack determines how far it may subsequently move.  Unlike that other title, in [i]Focus[/i] there is a renewing element of "reserves:" pieces which are returned to their owner if a stack exceeds a height of five.  You can also capture your opponents' pieces through stacking.  The board has a fixed starting layout which varies according to the number of players, as opposed to the alternating placement of stones in [i][thing=2346]DVONN[/thing][/i].  These traits lend [i]Focus[/i] a feeling of a more scripted experience.

I originally picked up a copy because I collect games which have won the [i][geekurl=/wiki/page/Spiel_des_Jahres]Spiel des Jahres[/geekurl][/i].  I enjoy [i]Focus[/i] every time I play it, but I honestly don't get to play it that often.  Multiplayer abstract games fill a very small niche, and address a similarly-sized demographic within my game-playing friends.

Domination version.  Played twice on 5/30/09.  Did not really enjoy the game but I think this has to do more with my general dislike of abstracts than this being a poor game.  It was fun, I just don't do well with abstract strategy and I kept making dumb moves.  While I did not enjoy it, the game's movement mechanism is really cool and unique and it didn't give me the feeling of chess like most other abstracts do, which is a big plus.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
A surprising success.  It is abstract strategy, and can lead to some analysis-paralysis if someone looks for the ideal move each turn, but with quick players it's a blast.  I like the way, in a multi-player game, people can be out of the game and then brought back in if their pieces are uncovered.  There's a lot of interesting depth to the strategy, and I could see players really working hard to get good at this game.  My only frustration is when it gets down to 2 players, and neither one has any free pieces.  This can cause the game to get into a never-ending chase around the board, similar to a game of Chess with only pawns and kings remaining.  But I think, with more experienced players, you will hold those free pieces for the final confrontation.  I was surprised how much I liked this game considering the negative press I heard.  Not a Top 10 game, but a deserving SdJ winner.

It seems really hard to come back if you go down in material - especially the off-board pieces that can be placed back anywhere. So it seems like the real interesting portion of this is the first 1/3 until someone gets more pieces in their stock...then they slowly grind out an inevitable victory.

It seems fitting to compare Focus to DVONN.  On the downside, Focus takes longer to play and is more complex.  On the positive side, Focus can be played by 2, 3, or 4 players.  Focus emphasizes capturing your opponent's pieces, taking a big stack back to an area under your control, and "piling on" to release captured pieces.  DVONN has a set up phase for the players and has an element where pieces can't move if they aren't next to a free space and die off if they are disconnected from the 3 DVONN pieces.  Even though both games involve stacking and move pieces equal to the stack's height, Focus is a little more like Chess and DVONN is a little more like GO.  Both games are a blast to play and I gave them both 10's.

It takes a few plays to appreciate the depth of this game, but it's brilliant.  If you like the way that chess trains your mind to visualize exchanges and combinations, you may well like this. Plus, it's quicker, while seeming comparably deep.

Designed by Sid Sackson. It is a fun game, and it allows you to play Dvonn as a four player game.  However, it is very hard to find 4 people that want to play an abstract game in my house and the box is very big.  Therefore, I kept Dvonn and had to let this go.

When we took on this SdJ winner, I figured it would be a hollow abstract that wouldn't click and we'd move on.  But it proved to be surprisingly engrossing.

Players pick up a stack of pieces (where their piece is on top) and move them the same # of spaces as the # of pieces in the stack.  If you stack up more than 5, you remove those on the bottom - capturing your opponents' pieces or putting your own in reserve to place back on the board later.

Although this could lead to a tedious stalemate, this game generally works in a satisfying way.  Definitely worth checking out if you get a chance.

Abstract game with simple rules. Suffers from the same problem as many other multiplayer abstracts: very little strategic possibilities since the board changes very quickly although in this case it's alleviated somewhat by the teamplay option.

Unfortunately, board position becomes pretty much irrelevant by midgame when people have stocked enough reserves to simply take over anything they want. Also, the endgame can be a real drag.

I revisited with Focus a couple of years later to see if I had grown some appreciation for it. Sadly, and frustratingly, no. It is clear there is lots of room for strategy, but I find the game requires a little too much visualizing for the effort it should really take. If you do not want to put that amount of energy into it, it just becomes a game of trying things out and hoping for the best, with some tactical push along the way. Overall, an interesting idea from a top designer, and a perfectly workable game, but these ideas have been used in future games much more successfully, in my opinion.

Domination is an abstract game from Sid Sackson where players need to be the last piece standing.

It plays 2-4, and basically operates on a top piece controls stacked pieces mechanic.

The playing area is big enough to allow for lots of mobility options- I'd have to say too big.

Like most of these games the early setup isn't as important as the midgame, and the endgame can be rather tedious as you chase various stacks about the board trying to to tie them down or wait for a fatal error.

I love very similar mechanics in DVONN- perhaps my favorite abstract; but in DVONN the limited play area and life reduction strategies make every move count, and that just doesn't seem true in FOCUS/Domination.

I think it's a genius mechanic- just not implemented as well in this game.

Deceptively simple abstract, that becomes annoyingly chess-like in the endgame. 4P game cut throat took 15 minutes to eliminate 2 players, and then it started to drag out in a near-stalemate. The survivors called it quits because the rest of us were getting impatient. It's a neat game, don't get me wrong, but it does not lend itself to a swift conclusion. Thus, it is not a good filler. Perhaps if 2 players wanted a chess-like death-match, but can't see this coming out during game night--it is too competitive.

Update (02/10/13): Never going to play this ever again. It's a '2'.

Relatively simple abstract game from Sid Sackson that I thought was just slightly above average played as a two player.  I'd rather not play the more chaotic four player version.  Dvonn appears to have taken its movement mechanic from this game, but is in my opinion not as good. (Although it should be noted that Dvonn has much nicer components) Unlike in Dvonn, players of Focus can elect to split stacks giving more flexibility of movement and providing a more interesting game.  

This is a solid abstract that I'd happily play again, but I'd rather play Hive or Ingenious if I have to play an abstract.

Mixed feelings after one and only play.  I need more of them to form a proper opinion.

Initial thoughts:

The game feels very modern despite it was conceived in the 60s.  It could've very well been a part of GIPF project (IF it weren't so deep).

The game reminds 3 other titles:
- much later invented DVONN - in terms of mechanics
- Abalone - in terms of prolonging struggle and moving forward painfully when two experienced players are involved
- Chess and alike classics - in terms of deepness, complex strategy and an immense distance to catch up by beginners compared to the experienced players.  Possibilities are overwhelming at first.

The first resemblance is very positive to me (I enjoy Focus mechanics), but the last two ones are discouraging.  I prefer logic games which are not tedious and with gameplay clearly leading to the conclusion (like the majority of GIPF games where shrinking board or other mechanics inevitably leads to the end of the game).

I'm willing to play more to confirm these observations.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Had I not played Dvonn before this my rating would be higher but to me Dvonn is the "improved" version of this game. 

Differences include being able to split up a stack, this is the rule I don't think I like as it creates too much back and forth and lengthens the game. On the plus you have more options, on the minus it promotes tit for tat type movements where player A sets something up, player B takes that away, and on and on. Dvonn fixes that. 

Another really cool slight difference is the way pieces are captured here, with capturing your own also possible and getting to put them in "reserve" to come out later, kind of like the one version of Chess, Shogi I think where pieces just "drop" back in. This is pretty neat but also lengthens the game. 

Only played 2 player, 3 player might be cool, 4 would be too long and chaotic most likely for an abstract. It's good no question, downright devious at times but somehow annoying too.

Very difficult to not compare this to Dvonn, with the similar movement rules.  I guess most people should have played Focus before having played any of the GIPF series, but I've come in the reverse way.  I don't see the need to play this when I can play Dvonn, but hopefully someone will prove me wrong.  Unfortunately, for 2-player abstracts, I believe the components make a big difference in the game experience, so this one suffers a bit.

by "own" I use dvonn pieces w/ a cheap checkers set.  Good abstract strategy game that must have inspired the gipft series.

Fun and interesting game so far, although I could see where it might go long.

Beats out Lines of Action for the title of most fun you can have with a checkers set. Although you need some extra pieces.

The game is not so much about owning lots of stacks as it is about merging tall ones, then protecting your large stacks, preferably with other large stacks. The resulting game is not something I enjoy. I was able to play the computer to a "draw" through mirror play.

Maybe if I palyed this before DVONN I would have liked it more.  It has more options than DVONN but it is not better for it.  The idea of bottom pieces getting pressed out of the stack is neat but in practice it's annoying that on many turns you have to pick up a big stack of pieces, remove the bottom one or two, put the remaining stack back on the board, throw away opponent pieces and put your own pieces in reserve.  The process is not fun at all.

2-player version: I can’t deny the brilliance of this design. There are layers upon layers of things to consider on each move, with calculations including (but not limited to) composition of stacks once they’re split, which pieces get pushed out the bottom for capture or reserve, how stacking battles will shape up considering each player’s reserves (and pieces in range to snipe), and how the composition of a besieged stack will change each time a piece is placed on it.

But two things are keeping me from loving the game: 1) These same mind-numbing calculations can lead to AP and a looooong game, and 2) The end-game can drag on as players move around a mostly empty board, even though one person is in a stronger position.

It’s possible for me that it’s best played with a timer.

For two player it's an easy to learn but deep, gripping stacking game (yes, Dvonn has a good amount of this in it, and tackles the symmetry problem present here... but it's not as complex). 

So, the infamous symmetry problem is there (two players will draw if the second one follows the first one's movements). Since I always play to win I couldn't care less, but for technique's sake Mr. Sackson himself suggested two solutions in his book A Gamut of Games: one is counting stalemates as a victory for the first player, the other is that both players exchange the positions of two pieces at the start of the game in a non-symmetric fashion. At least the second one works.

-

This is a fantastic, pure abstract strategy and tactics game. Simple rules, simple board, and simple pieces, but extremely deep. This is easily as good or better than any of the GIPF project games while pre-dating them by more than 30 years!  In fact DVONN has copied Focus's main movement mechanic (move a stack the number of spaces equal to the stack height.) On the box it says for 2-4 players, but this is by far best with only two.  It may be playable with 3, but I don't recommend it with 4 since a lot of randomness and loss of control will be introduced, and also the ganging up factor can detract from the game.

The planning ahead of one's moves, anticipating the opponent's move, and setting up tactical traps against the opponent can get almost as tense and deep as in chess! Albeit, not as multi-dimentional as in chess.  In short, this is a great brain burning game.

my copy of the game, made by Milton Bradley, is under its alternate name, "Domination", which is  appropriately named, since you usually want to have as many of your pieces on top of your opponent's pieces as possible!

Also known as Sid Sackson's game, Focus.

I've played once, and, I like it. It takes some basic planning and look-ahead. You have to make sure that you capture your own pieces, so that you can use them in hairier situations. That is an interesting dynamic. The game also plays quickly, which I like. Obviously, I need to play more to have a better supported opinion, but it's worth repeated play.

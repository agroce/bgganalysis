(2-5 players, 45 min) Track down a crew of thieves as they escape through the shops and streets. You only get to hear their footsteps each turn, but that may just be enough to pinpoint their location. A reimplementation of a classic Parker Brothers board game.

This was always one of my very favorite games growing up, so of course when I saw the Kickstarter campaign, I did not hesitate to back it.  The major question lay in Restoration Games' ability to update the game for today's audience while keeping the core mechanisms intact.  As it turns out, I had no need to worry.  It's obvious that Restoration has nothing but love for the original, and a high degree of reverence shines through every aspect of their creation.  I had some concerns with their decision to trade the open grid/dice movement mechanic for a path/card driven movement, but as it turns out this is perhaps my favorite change of the game, since it allows for asymmetric "powers" for each investigator as well as creating a far more strategic dynamic when pursuing the elusive thief.  Do I run headlong towards where I suspect the thief might be to position myself more effectively for a later turn, or do I sacrifice some movement early to move my opponent away from the scene, or get that private tip first and save my movement to pounce from a distance next turn?  It adds a great deal of depth and makes a great game even better.  The portrait art conveys the theme beautifully and consistently, and the board is gorgeous!  Very busy but not confusing at all, containing nods to the original as well as little easter eggs to be found in every building.  The app is very well thought out, with the expected updates to the sounds, added graphics, and even those of us bitten with the nostalgia bug can play the new game with the old sound effects from 1979 (I grinned like an idiot the first time I heard the old "window breaking" sound effect.  That one always made me laugh for some reason).  Not only that, but it even includes the old handheld unit keypad graphic as an option (for those REALLY wanting to go retro) and many ways to customize the difficulty of the game to expand replayability far beyond the original.  In short, if you're a fan of the original, it is a MUST BUY.  If you want a good family game that will test your deductive skills and keep everyone involved the entire game (even when it's not their turn), then I strongly suggest you pick it up.  If you have no interest in this type of game, then why are you still reading this review?  Go play something else.  Legendary, maybe.  That's good too.

I remember the commercials for this game from the 70s! Fun version; great app! My phone shut down and it held our place (phew). I want an expansion with more detectives with different abilities. It would be fun if everyone could use their own phones and have them synced. Because then we don't have to keep passing the phone around. That's how it shut down, someone pushed the wrong button while passing the phone.

RATING: 6.5
I like it - not sure I love it (and I generally love deduction games).  Haven't played Scotland Yard, but know the concept, and this is very similar - with auditory clues rather than visual.  All players are competitive investigators in this one with the AI as the thief.  In our first game with 3 players, the clues seemed relatively straightforward and catching the thief was relatively easy (though my son just kept guessing - incorrectly - which made things easier for the rest of us).  Our second game with 2 players felt much more brain-burny (the late hour may not have helped).

I like the different roles, but dislike the green player's powers of being able to steal $1K from another player with TWO of their cards.  That seems way overpowered (and we didn't play with green for that reason).  The app worked very well - no issues there.  I liked the different thieves - particularly the one that required payment for a private tip which made that round quite interesting.

Have only played the standard game thus far - need to try the more advanced option.

Logical deduction (not too deep and has an element of luck) for 2-4 players. An invisible suspect commits a crime. Only the sounds they make give them away. Listen to the clues and figure out where they are hiding. Play cards from your unique deck to move around the board, sneak through a window, or even get a private tip. Once you have the suspect pinned down, swoop in and make the arrest.

Some glitches and a disconnect between the rulebook and the app make this a little tougher to get into than it needs to be. However, it is the best hidden movement game I know of with the exception of the brilliant Specter Ops. 

For whatever reason, the genre is full of deeply flawed games, and this one gets much more right than most. The main selling point is that deduction and thrill of the chase are front and center; not overburdened with excessively long play time (Letters) or dozens of unrelated rules that only water down the game's strengths (FoD).

An alert pops up on your smartphone: A crime has just been committed! Grab your investigator's license and your keen powers of deduction and hunt down the suspect. But watch out because you're not the only private eye on the hunt, and only one of you can slap the cuffs on the suspect and claim the reward. Get enough reward money, and you can finally leave this rat race behind and retire to a sunny tropical beach in the Caribbean.

Nice race/hunt the robber game, where players are trying to piece together clues to find a hidden character moving across the board based on a companion app.  Only one game in but it worked really well.  Light, family fare, but lovely to look at, and fun.

Three game update and begun to tweak the very customisable app.  Excellent game!  Can't wait for the app updates to add more game play modes.  Well done to all involved!

Good family gateway game.

The app works well.  I played a test game to get the feel for it and you really have to work out the possibilities, but in the end you may just be taking a guess between 2 spots.  Playing that card to get a private tip at the right time is key.

In standard mode, the app gives the names of the streets when the thief is on them, but I'm not sure which ones they refer to.

After playing with a few other gamers, I would go to the intermediate mode for them.

Probably my favorite game when I was around 11 years old! It's so cool that I now get to experience it with my 11-year-old son! I was so amazed when I saw this was being reprinted. It holds up pretty well for an almost 40-year-old game. I really like the addition of the cards in place of dice, which gives each investigator their own personal flavor. The app is really well done as well, and it obviously beats the clunky 70's gadget that we had to use when I was a kid. This one will definitely remain in my collection!

First I should say this is a family style game. So if you're a serious gamer you'll find this very boring.

It isn't a serious game and it isn't meant to be. It is a very light-hearted game meant for play with people who want to have casual and light fun.

If you play with 3 or 4 players, especially 4, you'll find the friends and family interaction while playing quite fun. Listen for the clues, try to guess where the location of the thief before your opponents. Then watch them laugh when you guess wrong since now they know right where he is.  The re-play value solely depends on whom you play with. Don't take it seriously, don't fret because the rules aren't 25 pages, grab your kids or friends and have a good time.

A light deduction game.  You have a thief in a location and he starts moving.  And based on how he moves, you start to determine where he is.  You then play cards to move to his location and try to make an arrest.  You get money based on his value.  First to 25 k wins.

I found it ok.  But I thought it was a bit boring.  I found it pretty repetitive.  I liked the app.  I would play if others wanted to play but I was not keen on it.

One of my most anticipated purchases this year.  Extremely happy to see this back on the market.  Restoration Games has done a fantastic job with recreating the feel of the 1979 classic.  The component and app quality is top notch!  Basic elements are in place.  Love the new wrinkles the trigger with the rewards for the robbers.  It gives a sense of unpredictability with each new thief to catch.  

It fall a little short on a couple of elements.  The path layout is a little confusing upon first exposure as some spaces that seems like the should be connected by footsteps aren't.  

And the biggest shortfall is with the movement cards.  I may be in the minority, but I wasn't bothered by the "roll and move" element of the original.  I appreciate the ability to strategize and remove some luck-based elements, but felt like having only six to choose from was restricting.  Some of us also felt it was odd that some character let you move up to 12 while others didn't.  Understand that having special powers appeals to some, but it felt unfair or odd.  Would have at least wanted a communal deck of movement cards that players could draw from through the game, so that at least you had some opportunity to get a big number.

All in all, I recommend the game!  And I'd have a pair of dice handy if you want to play something a little closer to the original.

The print-and-play prototype components were functional but without any art at all.  Still, the game was really fun!

A great introduction to hidden movement. The thief tends to do some tricky stuff (only played on the intermediate difficulty, ready for advanced), and the private tips the app gives make for some cool deduction scenarios. All the detectives feel different. And with the alternative difficulty modes, this could be a good one to introduce to non-gamers and families.

As one player said, "It feels like a older game, but better than an actual older game."

RATING: 5
I don't come into this game with the same nostalgia as others.  But for me: Most situations on Easy are too easy.  Most situations on Hard require you to get private tips early and often.  Most situations on Medium will come down to a legitimate 50/50 guess... and if you don't guess right, someone else will get it before your next turn.

For older fans of the game, I'm sure the movement cards are a welcome add.  But no one over the age of 8 without that tie back needs to play.

I played the original enough that this version doesn't really interest me much. It does add to the game in a couple of ways, and it's a really lovely production, for sure. Being able to review the thief's entire route on a full colour map in the app is easily my favourite addition. The movement cards is an obvious and effective fix for roll-and-move.

Yet somehow, I still prefer the clarity of the old map! And I actually think the simplistic bleeps and bloops of the old device are more direct than the new, realistic samples. Maybe it's just the nostalgia talking here though.

Hidden movement/deduction game, but here the bad guys are controlled by the game, and players compete to hunt them down. We love this genre of game, but this makes a nice change for us (especially when playing with just two players), as it's unusual for one of us not to have to do the running/hiding (as enjoyable as that role can be in other similar games).

This is a redesigned/modernised version of a 1979 game, using a mobile/tablet app in place of the original's bespoke electronic device (allowing for different custom rules variations, and future updates to include eg. co-op play), and using cards for movement instead of rolling dice.

Mmm, having now seen the reviews I see the similarity to Scotland Yard but deducing location of the thief based on aural clues rather than the visual ticket display, so probably a little easier. Not sure on it being app-based (so far problems have arisen) nor liking one of the investigators being able to steal $ from others.

I own the original game and this is a wonderful remake of the original.  I really like the app integration and the upcoming updates to the app that will give different ways to play the game.  My family and I have played it a number of times and are really enjoying it.  The sound effects are vastly improved over the electronic device in the original, but there is the ability to change the sound effects to the original if you want that nostalgic experience.  The board is beautiful with embossing similar to Spectre Ops which really makes the graphical details pop.  Overall, a great remake.  Restoration Games is doing a fantastic job showing their love for these classics.  I will be purchasing each of their games.

I like the simple, clean mechanics of this one. We had one person in our group struggle with the app, and by that I mean a tendency to accidentally touch the screen leading to double hints and an odd glitch where the app decided to revert back to the previous thief. To be fair, the app was exited mid game. And even with these set backs, the game still went over well.

As a light gateway game or filler, Stop Thief! has plenty to offer. The card and movement system, the deduction of the thief's location, and the minor cash-counting are all straightforward concepts. I'd love to try this with my daughter when she's a bit older. Weathered players might not be quite as smitten, but it's meaty enough that I doubt most people would resist playing it now and then.

First play impression: really liking this game. The asymmetrical cards are a huge plus, you can explain the whole game in just a couple of minutes, and the very light level of deduction where you don't even need pencil and paper is perfect.

My only complaint is the importance of the "private clue" cards and the turn order. The deduction is simple enough that you can usually narrow down the thief's position to two positions. If your turn comes up, you have to either use a private clue to see his exact position or take a 50/50 guess. But on the next turn the thief may move onto a space that gives away his exact position, so now the next player has an advantage if they happen to be nearby. If you've already used your private clue card, you now have to waste a turn getting your cards back before using it again. I'm wondering if the game is best at three players because of this, so each person is more likely to get turns where the thief is in a guaranteed position. Have only played with four so far.

There can also be some usability issues with the board. It's easy to miss some of the thief's connections so I find it best to highlight a few of the harder-to-see connections before the game starts so that everybody is on the same page.

Overall the game is just fun. You can explain it in just a couple of minutes, there's asymmetry, and the light deduction ensures that everybody is equal even is you can't deal with some of the heavier deduction games.

Got the original for Xmas back the year it came out... My brother and I played the crap out of it; still have it in the original box which is pretty beat up :) and missing the instruction book. Looking forward to playing the updated version!

This is the Restoration Games updated version that uses an app as opposed to the super computer included in the original. The game holds up. If you want it for nostalgic reasons, you'll love it. If you have never played it and are just curious about the game I would suggest giving it a shot. Restoration Games has been excellent to their fans and I am happy with this product. They have made strong improvements and the game is strong.

Fun re-skin of the old classic. The app works very well. I especially liked the fun sound effects and thief replays. We did find the intermediate level a bit confusing, as not all thief behaviours are surfaced in the rules (backtracking, etc). This led to a bit of confusion. Playing on "standard" settings kept things easy while re-learning the game, and the possibility for a thief to be on a couple of different spots means you always have to take a bit of a chance.

The investigator powers and movement cards are a great change, and thieves all have some personality. The board, while nice looking, does make it a bit confusing with all of the footsteps.

Decent enough, but pretty light.

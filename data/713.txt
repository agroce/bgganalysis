This is a throwback to the 80's for me. I remember playing this one back in the days of chuckles - games that you played just because you wanted to grin. But as with so much, the memory is better than the reality. I don't like Nuclear War as a game. It's more just a way to share some time and laugh with friends.

I tried to play this one several times, but it seemed to me to be less like a game and more like a political statement disguised as a game (war is bad, mmm'kay?  You can't hug your children with nuclear arms, etc).  Gave this one away to my friend, who couldn't bear to see me throw it out.

This game is more luck of the draw than strategy or hand management, but if you have a big group and the right people, this game is awesome.  The right group has a lot of table talk to go along with a bit of dark humor, and a fun time by all.

Ok, I've now played Nuclear War.  Heavy rules, lots of downtime, way too random (the whole game is based on the draw of a card) and just a little too difficult to play and have a good time...

Did I forget to mention the components were crap?  (And I buy a *lot* of Cheapass' games, and I don't mind cheap...)

Thats not a puddle. That's your population. Can't think why CND tried to get this banned. It's the best advertisment for their campaign that they could have.

A fun explosion filled game.  You send up a missle, put a warhead on it, then flip a spinner to see how much damage it'll do.  There aren't THAT many decisions (other than who to attack and what to use), but it's very simple to learn and play, and it plays fairly quickly.  Plus, it's just fun watching the destruction missles can do, especially when someone's population is all dead, and they can retaliate...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Silly cathartic player conflict. This game is all about playing out the grudges you may have. Your friend owes you $5, nuke em into oblivion. Of course they are just as likely to vaporize you in a radioactive mist. This game is considered by many to be overpriced for what you actually get, but its a great beer and pretzel chaotic game. Most people who have played have fond memories of blowing away their friends.

RATING: 4
A dated card game that involves blowing up your opponent's population with nukes while trying to keep yours alive, usually by sheer luck.  A very light game that has more fun in role-playing fictitious nations in a style akin to Orwell's 1984.  Actual game play is limited.  Turn order appears to have at least some influence on outcome.  Not a spectacular game design.  [GTI Code: TGCL]

Chaos and destruction to all!  Must be played in the right mood, and with the right nonchalant attitude.  After all, it only your citizens.  There's plenty more where they came from.  Oops, no there isn't.  Game over.

Great whimsical card game representing nuclear apocolypse.  Lots of fun nuking your friends populations, or stealing them with propoganda about how much better your country is.  Everyone wants to get the 200 megaton warhead launched!  Now if G.W. Bush could learn to say Nuclear, all would be good.

Distinctly underwhelmed. It has almost every aspect of Ameritrash that I hate. A play time that is much to long for the level of fun it offers, complete randomness and a theme that still reeks of Cold War sensationalisim.

Was really looking forward to this game and there were a lot of potentially interesting aspects to it. However, considering that this game has been around for many many years and revisions it is unforgivable that the rules are so ambiguous. In order to play this game we actually had to write up our own summary of the turn sequence, carefully decrypted from the rule sheet. It seems like this game has a following and even tournaments! Designers, please take the time to revise and clarify the rules so that someone can learn the game in a few minutes and not spend their entire game trying to fill in the blanks that the designers glossed over. Playtest with people that haven't played before and these issues will be crystal clear.

An old classic and one of those games that is still a lot of fun in the right company. Serious gamers may have less fun with the randomness, player elimination and all-round chaos, but these are also all factors that contribute to making the game such fun.

Dont expect any great strategy, just lots of take that and millions of people dieing. As long as you can cope with that in a light-hearted way you may well enjoy this game.

Another remarkable take-that! that emerged in the 60's. Players must manage their hand by "programming" various cards in advance of play. Typically, Propoganda and Secrets are played first, followed by armed rockets when "Diplomacy" fails. Now that the nuclear edge appears to be off of us these days (knock on wood), some of the games cards appear dated, even though the game has seen numerous expansions through the decades. Still a lot of fun-- with the right group!

A fun light game, but in no way balanced. Waaaay too luck driven for serious play. Hand full of propaganda? Too bad. No warheads? Sucks to be you. Sitting to the right of the player with lots of interceptor cards? Hope you brought a book. But, as long as you are playing multi-player, a weak hand might be just the thing to keep you unnoticed until the good cards start showing up... Good fun as a beer & pretzels game. (Also note, my wife always has at least 3 of the 8 25 million population cards, regardless of the number of players. She doesn't even put effort into bluffing about it any more.)

Hard to rate this one.  Not really a strategy element to it.  However, it's a good at the end of the night game to play to get the frustrations out...  So, if you approach it that way and don't expect to win, it's fun to play, assuming that you ignore the millions of people dying...

Like this game for its historical element, and its tongue in cheekiness.  While the pacing seems a little off and the game suffers from obvious elimination and blow-up-the-leader issues, it's still pretty fun for the theme alone.  Certainly not a game to play very often.

After a second play, the repetition is a little disappointing.  Reviews say that the game isn't that good without the expansions, and I'd tend to agree.  It would probably be a much better game with the expansions and a lot more choices / decisions to make.

Of the "stupid screw your neighbor" category of games, this is the best by far. A lot of fun, and you get to be vindictive without any real drawbacks. The only real downside (well, other than the complete randomness and the rather brutal nature of the game, if you can't live with that) is the player elimination problem. But, since this will be an opener or filler these days, it doesn't seem like that big a deal. Kinda cool because it's playable with *lots* of players.

If you play this game in a "social" fashion (i.e., spreading the pain), you will lose, as everyone will attack you back.  Target one person, and keep hitting him until he is dead--that way, only one person will be trying to hit you, and the others will leave you alone.  If someone else arbitrarily starts hitting you, then abruptly change your focus on them, and that'll teach the other players not to mess with you.  If you have few propaganda cards, start hostilities ASAP.  In fact, it would seem to me that in a typical game, peacetime should last no more than one turn.  This game can bog down if played with slow people--it's more fun at high speeds (this ain't a thinker, folks).

Draw cards randomly then play the biggest ones. When I saw that you line up cards for future turns and then turn one up per turn, I thought there would be some funny mishaps and interference between players but sadly no. The negotiation of threats and treaties is fun but because some players pick up more powerful cards they win.

I don't understand the appeal this game has. Not only is your initial hand random, but your starting 'life' is as well. I never felt in control playing the game at all, you seem to either draw what you need, when you need it, or you don't, and there's little you can do to change that. Some might enjoy that kind of game, but it's just not my cup of tea.

RATING: 8
It was more fun in the 80's when we were afraid of this really happening and before we all started playing games about hedgehogs, hot air balloons, and fish delivery!  Seriously, this game is a terrific relic of the cold war and the design was pretty far ahead of its time.  These days, Nuclear War is a light, kill-your-friends kind of game that is still worth playing if you don't mind elimination and ample doses of black humour.

Admittedly this was an impulse buy.  I've only played it a couple times and never more then with 3 players.  So perhaps I'm being too harsh here and haven't given the game a chance.  The game does have its funny moments and the general concept is quite fun.  I don't really like the paper playing board pieces; it makes the game feel cheap.  I'm also not too fond of games that eliminate other players from the game.  They should have learned from Joshua, "The only way to win is not to play."

RATING: 7
Silly, fun, simplistic cold war game of launching nuclear missiles and killing millions of people.  When you run out of people you are out of the game.  This is an original game and plays quickly.  Rules are light and this plays well as 4 person multi-player game.

Zany game.  There is a little strategy, but you can completely get bonked by the imbalanced randomness.  If you're cool going with the flow, it's fun.  I put it on wacky/strategy level of Killer Bunnies and Exploding Kittens.  Ultimately, the randomness determines the winner in an off-the-wall card game the has a touch of strategy to it.  

The rules are a little clunky, so watch a video online.  Bought the Kickstarter in 2015.  

I think there's a cult following out there from nostalgia or the offbeat theme.  I'm glad it's in my collection, but I am not absolutely bananas over it.  The old school graphics are cool.

A nuclear party card game. Players try and diminish each other's population by means of propaganda during peace time, and by means of nuclear war heads during...war. What did you expect ? It's a satirical game with funny cards, especially the propaganda cards. Has to be played with a large group of players to get the most fun out of the game. I can imagine the game needs some expansions in order to keep the fun going. And these expansions do exist.

A light game which can be fun in the right setting.  Decent tension around "who is going to screw who first"  and once that starts it usually ends fairly quick with a free for all.  Quite silly but that is nuclear war isn't it?  ;)

Probably my main gripe is the required initial resolution of secrets.  Can drag on as a player draws one or more secrets to replace secrets played.  

Not for serious strategy enthusiasts or those who are overly sensitive to injustice.  Of course totally random in the card draw.  A between game or filler that can be played in 45 minutes to an hour.

When war games go wrong!  This game is a tongue-in-cheek look at Nuclear Holocaust.  I love it, even though my wife won't play, due to the subject matter.

I am thinking maybe this game is a relic of the past, a game not worth trying to love.  That is my first theory on why I don&#039;t like this game.  My second and maybe more reasonable is that I have only played this game four times and I am pretty sure all four times had only three players, maybe once had four, it seems the game would be better with more.  I just thought of a third reason, all those jokes about needing change for ten million people.

A simple take-that card game with a fun theme (no, really) and some table politics.  The problem is that everybody's starting strength is random, and there is zero control in the game.

RATING: 2
Rating was based on a first playing without expansion sets; the game was stopped because we had much better games to play.  The rules are not lucid enough, so I will have to peruse all the FAQ's and quick reference documents before I will give it another chance.  One player was out on the first turn without getting a chance to play and this immediately set the tone for the remaining two turns we played.  The experience was made much worse by unclear rules.  If I can ever persuade others to give it another chance then the rating might rise, but I doubt it.  This should have been a better experience, but not only does it seem there is little control, the different strategies stated in the rules do not seem to be an option.  Very very poor; I can only say in its defence it was designed in the 1960's, and perhaps for that time it was groundbreaking and/or fun.  My opinion may change but the future looks like Nuclear Winter for this one.

Everyone's favorite Cold War classic about mutually assured destruction is worth playing if only for the chance to ask for change for 25 million people.

RATING: 6
One of the oldest last-man-standing games, and it's showing its age.  The main problem is that it usually takes 2 cards (launcher + warhead) to do anything.  So instead of a fast and furious exchange of blows, you have to wait your turn.  And sometimes war starts when you have propaganda still in the queue or your bomber ran out of fuel and can't deliver the remaining warheads, so your turn is wasted...  This would be a good game if it was crammed into 30 minutes or less, but it drags on too long, and none of the expansions mitigate this.

From what I remember of this, I loved it.  Finally picked it up on sale at my FLGS.  First thing that really blew me away was the extremely poor quality.  The instructions were just a photocopied piece of paper and the 'cards' for your population you have to cut out yourself.  That's just bad form for a modern game.  If it was going to be like that it should have been about $10 and put out by Cheap Ass Games.  I'm rather disapointed in Flying Buffalo.  As for the gameplay, I don't have a paper cutter so haven't been able to find out.

A fun and relaxing game that reminds me of the most nightmarish product of industrial civilization.

RATING: 6
I enjoyed this in high school with my like-minded nuke-happy buddies. It offends my wife, would make some parents of our youth group kids a bit squeamish, but I secretly still wouldn't mind playing it every once in a while. Reckless fun with nukes that kills millions of people? You HAVE to approach it lightheartedly or else you'll just get offended.

RATING: 7
Quick and fun.  The rules are a little clunky, and you have a random starting population, so can sometimes be killed off incredibly quickly, but a lot of the time the game ends with everyone losing as the world is destroyed in a nuclear holocaust.  Fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
Great old time ridiculous card game.  We used to play all the time.  Best results were when everyone lost, because when eliminated, a player gets to make a final assault which can chain around the table wiping everyone out.  The real challenge is trying to be the lone survivor of this fallout.

RATING: 5
Not too bad, a quick and easy game of blowing away your opponents with nuclear warheads. Not a whole lot of strategy going on though, just hope you get lots of population and hope you draw the big warheads and bombers.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Yea I know this game is a stupid and pointless, but its just fun.  Best played with large groups, just make sure the other players have something else to do if they get nuked out at the start of the game.  This game is all about diplomacy, forming alliances and backstabing.   Its fun to play as a drinking game at a party.  When I play I take out the "25 million of the enemy's population mysteriously vaporized" card because it does the same thing as the Supergerm card, and one of those cards is bad enough.    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
While I liked the idea, this game is a too over the top for me.  Felt like I had no control over what I was doing and it always felt like we were in a race to see who could annihilate the world first.

RATING: 4
Silly game about the perils of nuclear war. Destroy 25 million people and one dog with your nuclear warheads!

Hilarious, fun, and easily played in an evening... REPEATEDLY
This game with its ultra quirky cards always tickles my funny bone.
I've even gotten my "non-wargammer" friends to play this from time to time.
There's nothing like blowing up 10 million people, except possibly watching your neighbors beatnik pacifists defect to your country...

RATING: 8
This is one of the best under-rated, under-produced and under-played board games out there. I wish Fantasy Flight would buy the rights to it and release the game + the two, original expansions as a higher quality box. But the mechanics and game play are awesome! The production value is very old and busted, but playability wise it ROCKS!

A long enduring game that is always fun even for non-gamers.  It picks up quickly.  The games aren't always the same and it's a lot of fun.

I 'typical' take that game, where you really have to go at each other, yet due to the 'comical' theme, feelings don't tend to be hurt.

It was fun enough, and we played it enough, in U at the club, but it is a lame game. It all comes down to who gets dealt the big population cards.

We played this trilogy quite a bit some years ago (when we didn't have many games). A bit of nostalgia lost.

RATING: 5
Can be cute to play with a group but it's not much of a game and the endgame can really drag if people don't draw the things they need to just end it. Player positions are incredibly random at the beginning with some players easily having triple the population of others. Not a game you play to have a serious thinky time of course - shoot things and spin the dial and yell about it. That's what this game is for.

RATING: 2
Is this a "stupid fun" game or is it just plain "stupid"? Well, it didn't matter, as my first and last game, even though I was technically the last survivor, I didn't last long as because as soon as I wiped out the third-to-last player, he nuked the second-to-last player, who then wiped me out for a draw. The game play is idiotic and the mechanics is trivial. Yes, there were some laughs, and there is some subtle strategy somewhere in here, but this is only slightly better than Star Munchkin, which I detest. Just shoot me.

Update (12/09/12): I suppose this game has historical significance. It was probably pretty good back in the day, but it doesn't hold a candle to today's stuff. Never playing it again. It's a '2'.

Other than the spinner, miss a turn, and even worse, play elimination I kind of like this game.

The biggest issue is player elimination in the first or second round. It sucks, and happens often.

It has been a while since we have played this game, but I do enjoy it with friends, and don't think I would bring it out with new people due to the quick player elimination.

RATING: 7.1
A game that's more a lesson in group dynamics when one begins taking pot shots at another. First game we played resulted in MAD (mutually assured destruction) as one nuclear stockpile was unleashed against another resulting in a domino of mutual death. The new spinner shipped with the game didn't work,and the cheap plastic die was absolute garbage. If the designer had spent more time on art and creativity (for the propaganda cards) and a bit more money on better game pieces it would improve the game for me. But you can pimp this game yourself if you want to spend the time and while your at it you'll have to collate all of the expansion rules yourself, because the developer couldn't have bothered. My advice get a couple of packs of the better population cards for sale rather than the crappy paper cutouts that stick together. Not bad ... but execution could have been better.

Back when this came out, or before the Euro tide, I could see how it would be innovative and a laugh riot. It's still fun, but these days would involve more development. There isn't as much control as I would like.

Had a lot of fun with this one. My, at the time, gaming group made up a bunch of their own cards which really added to the game. Always thought it was a blast and cringed when I nuked someone out of the game and they got final retaliation. Another, sometimes there are no winners, game.

I can see why this game has its fans.  It must have been innovative for its time, and that theme is kind of fun.  The table talk can be really entertaining.  I even like the choices in who to attack.  As a player who tries to burn as few bridges as possible, it's akin to Intrigue that you have to choose wisely who to go after.  But the randomness in the card draw and especially in the initial deal of population kind of invalidates most of the choices you make in the game, which is pretty much a dealbreaker.

I really liked it every time I've played it, even with a lot of people, but of course it could be the nostalgia factor. With too many people it can be very long.

This was a classic or me and a group of friends. During junior high school phys ed, we'd arrive in the locker room, only to sneak away to our board gaming club which overlooked the quad., as soon as the gym teacher left. We'd then play Nuclear War until the rest of our classmates started making their way off the quad, in time for us to pack it up, and be back in time for the teacher to see us.  This was our MO for a full year.
The teachers never noticed, or never cared. Quite obviously they only really cared foir the kids who were good at soccer.

A fun game, largely because of the absurd theme ‚Äî Though it‚Äôs less compelling now that there isn‚Äôt an active cold war.  The game itself is really just about deciding who to shoot at.  That makes for pretty dull decisions, but the game is fast enough that this doesn‚Äôt matter much.

It's a neat, light game to play once in a while. Very poor components overall. Stay clear of the expansion booster packs. The cards overall do not add much and just lengthen the game, which was intended to be short and sweet in the first place.

So the memory of being introduced to this game once at college by my friend Neil kicked this off again. I remembered this game, how chaotic it was, how I could not believe you could get wiped out just like that and sought it out. Could not remember the name at first but then I stumbled over this website called boardgame geek and there it was. Got the game , was not quite a chaotic or immediate death as I remembered but it was fun and different. And this site had a top 100 on it. strange games I had never heard of. So I tried some .. .now I have > 275..

I loved the 80's computer game. I love the theme (i.e. I'd love to nuke my friends). However the board game sucks. The packaged rules seem to be flawed. The missile cards seem to make a disproportionately high amount of damage for the population cards in the game.

I played this only once with 4 players. By the end of the first round (~5') one player was eliminated. In the second round, I was eliminated. Never tried to play it again.

The horror!  This game is way too dependent on the luck of the draw for population and for weapons.  In the game I played, I started with only 20 million people and they all died before the game really started, due to a secret played on me.  Now I know the rules to a game I have never played and probably won&#039;t play in the future.

This is our refresher game... takes the intensity of strategy and throws it pretty much out the window. All bets are off as the game more often than not ends with noone winning - what could be more appropriate when dealing with nuclear warfare. We have heavily customized game play with our own cards, rules, and countries, but the core remains. Good solid random fun where if you choose, you can really screw someone else. Ahhh, pure destruction.

Each player starts with a unknown population of millions. You take turns laying cards facedown to steal other players population cards, or arm weapons and blow them up. The game always follows a typical pattern, and reply is limited. Its a game to get out once a year when your board after a day of real gaming...

The idea itself makes for some silly fun. The mechanics themselves seem to create a huge variety in the kind of game one might end up playing. It seemed like there wasn't really enough there (or too much) to really compel one to make the most of the theme and possible player interaction. I dunno, I think I wanted to like it more than my experience seemed to be.

RATING: 4
2 / 5 - Fair.

Very, very silly. Would be awful if it were longer but as it is it's a murderously fun, relatively mindless slaughterfest. Which is the whole point, really. I say "relatively" mindless because you do have to plan a little in advance and the game also benefits from a particularly mean streak of inter-player diplomacy but in the end everyone nukes everyone and it's the biggest bombs that count. It's rather sad that the satirical aspects of the game are still relevant today, but such is life.

RATING: 6
Flying Buffalo classic. 

Does anyone have change for 25 million people?

The game captures the zeitgeist of the 80s. It also succesfully satirizes nuclear war and the absurdity that it entails.

10/06/07 Played once. This game is supposed to be a satirical, light-hearted romp through nuclear Armageddon.  The one and only reason I played was due to it being about the only multi-player game we had on hand one day. I do not find the Cold War period enjoyable to game. And I especially do not find it in any way amusing. But for anyone that cowered in a closest as a child during the Cuban missile crisis as the civil defense sirens went off, while being told we might all die in the next few hours, I don't find nuclear war funny in the least. So the chances of me ever playing this game again are about the same as getting a New Yorker to play an Osama bin Laden whacks the World Trade Center game.

A once great game that has received little attention from its designer and publisher. In its day it was a fantastic game that held its own until the 90s. But in this day in age of tightly designed Euros it skulks around in the shadows, just getting by (selling pocket watches from its trench coat).

This is a great game waiting to rise like a phoenix from the ashes. But the publisher/designer keeps milking it. Don't believe me? Check out the photocopied playing mats that come with the expansion. Or the photocopied population cards that look like they're photocopies of photocopies of photocopies. Another gripe about the population cards. If the game comes with nicely produced printed cards, why are the population cards cut-yourself sheets?

Lastly... It's time to put it all in one box. It's not worth $100 to get all the expansions, boosters, that are made using photocopied components! Plus, this will allow for a comprehensive rulebook making the game more accessible to new players. (I'm not even going to go into the separate rule sheets with each expansion. Assume the worst.)

Sell the rights and let the next generation of publishers and designers carry this game back to the greatness it once had.

I think the games absurdity and quick play has allowed it to become a classic.  First a number of population cards are dealt to each player (these cards range from 1-25 Million).  You may get lucky you may not.  Then you also gain a hand of nukes, warheads and propaganda.  Their are propaganda rounds and nuke rounds... propaganda happens until a nuke is launched.  The nukes take a three turns to launch so you're queueing up your cards face down.

The randomness of the populations and strength of the nukes you're dealt make it very difficult to control your outcome perhaps reflecting the real world more than we would like to acknowledge.  If you think someone is the leader it's really best to gang up on that person or s/he'll surely out survive you.

Kaboom! Now this is how a lucky game full of "take that" cards should be designed. Knock each other down, and the last man standing wins. As opposed to certain other games where each player climbs UP to a certain goal, meanwhile knocking DOWN the other players. The winner of these games is the player who manages to reach the goal when all other players happen to have run out of ammo.

One of my all-time favourites, but I can't in good conscience say most others will feel the same.  Cheap components and at-times poorly explained rules hurt, while a combination of "lose a turn" cards and a reliance on random draws to gain the cards needed to actually attack means you can easily experience a good amount of downtime.  Still, if you want a quick, silly, easy-to-learn game with the satisfying feeling of scouring all life from the earth, it's hard to do better, as long as you like randomness rather than deep strategy.  If you hate Talisman and similar random games, you probably won't like this.

Too much luck for my taste: random hand, random starting population, random side effects of each missile... sheesh.  Possible to die in the first round if you get a bad population draw and someone throws a disease your way.  Minimal planning, no discernable strategy.  Yeah, it's a "beer and pretzels" game, but there are dozens of those types of games I'd rather play than this one.

RATING: 5
Farcical -since it's so obvious that you can't take it seriously it's a very rewarding game in spite of its faults (very luck dependant, players can get bullied out of the game... at least they get the chance to pay back if so). It's not that long either, so it avoids becoming the unbalanced torture that Risk is, for example. Ideal for the little round of nasty play and chuckles.

Honestly, I think this game would have appealed to me twenty years ago and I would have given it a higher rating.  These days, with less free time, more gaming experience and thus more refined tastes I just can't get into the theme or the randomness of it.  It's not the inherent violence (hey, I enjoy chopping heads off nobles in Guillotine!) it's more the senselessness of Mutually Assured Destruction as a theme that turns me off.  Not really any strategy that I can see and players can get knocked out early due to bad luck (which sucks).  Obviously not a game to be taken too seriously.  Still, one to be played for the experience I guess.

Killer bunnies is definitely a more colorful and family friendly version of Nuclear War! But, with the right group of people this game has its niche!

An old classic
A lot of fun as a multiplayer game. I have 2 sets so we can accomodate 7-8 players around the table.
A good cut-throat beer and pretzels game with players who don't get upset when stabbed by their peers around the table.
Nowdays would play 'Bang the Bullet' in preference.

Good: Wonderful card art and the overall flavor is very entertaining.

Bad: Enjoyment of gameplay is dependent on how much silly-go-time rules you're willing to deal with. There wasn't much of a sense of competition, and nuking people was more along the lines of "oh yeah, well take THAT" than anything else. What I mean is that, in a game where your primary activity is essentially screwing other people over, your ability to do so derives solely from the luck of the draw (and luck of the draw dictates every single aspect of the game, right down to how much health you have) and has very little to do with tactics. I get the underlying thematic reasoning for why the game's like this (MAD is KARRAAAAZY), but the mechanics are essentially a slightly more complicated version of the quintessential do-nothing card game, War.

All players represent a nation with a population what's size is only known to the player. The last remaining nation wins.
Playing you launch missiles or send bombers wearing warheads to your enemies. Your opponents might play some defense but if a nuke drops on them you have to give an arrow on a clock a sling and that determines the effect of the bomb.
This is not the greatest card game.

Missles. Bombers. Warheads. Propagandas. Secrets and Top Secrets. Try to convert your opponents population then send nukes at them. It works well for its theme, and I'm glad that it is so short.

funny concept, but not that good of a game. It just takes too long to actually do anything. i also wish there was a way to get rid of a bad hand and draw some more cards. the game would go by so much quicker if you could refresh your hand, without having to depend on drawing a card that lets you draw more cards. of course playing with every expansion probably exasperates this problem . . .

More of a testament to the games in the stone age of boardgames, but as a game it couldn't stand up to any of the games that got published in the last 15 to 20 years or so.

It has some interesting ideas, which can all be seen in more recent games of this genre, but the way they are implemented shows how much of a progress game designers have made in (making us players) simulating (cold war) strategies.

Play 5 minutes of it and move on to another game.

The ultimate lesson of this game is that there are no winners in a nuclear war.  Just like this game.  Play for over an hour and everyone loses.  This is one of the few games where everyone can be cutthroat and everyone still gets along with no hurt feelings.  Always played with all the expansions.  My biggest bomb was a 600 megaton that cracked the earth.

I loved this game in college, but we played it too often. Then we started playing with drinking rules, for even more mayhem. One game, one of our drunken players accidentally got hit with his own cruise missile, twice! This is a great multi-player game, especially if you get into the social aspect by trash-talking, whining and otherwise manipulating your enemies. The potential for everybody to lose is highly thematic and was kind of disturbing back in the days of the Cold War.

A fun take that game. This one is a hoot! Each of the players will draw one card, play one card, and reveal one card on their turn.

It's certainly very fun and in the beer and pretzels sense, but being able to kill 25 Million people with one card draw leaves this game drastically open to random chance. Also, the Eurogamer in me has grown past the player elimination aspect a bit. This is definitely an "in the right mood" game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Card games always involve a certain amount of luck of the draw; I have no problem with this.  Nuclear War, however, seems to go out of its way to make sure that almost no one has a workable hand.  Not only can you end up with crap cards, you also have the awesome possibilities of:
(1) great warheads but no missiles on which to load them
(2) great missiles but no warheads to fire
(3) great warheads and missiles that don't happen to be compatible.

The more serious problem here is that you can't necessarily make the best of a bad situation; if your missiles and warheads don't link, you can't do much of ANYTHING, and it's quite possible that you will have no useful plays for several consecutive turns.  Mechanically, I'd say this game rates a 4 or a 5, but I bump it up because the theming is excellent.

Online play only (gametableonline.com), against bots. Starting population, secrets (events that usually decrease someone's population), and cards in hand (need delivery system and warhead to attack) are all totally random. This is probably the first use of the plan-2-turns-in-advance mechanism (as seen in Killer Bunnies ad infinitum). This seems like one of those games you play for the experience (should be fun to sit around and blow up the world?) rather than for the game. Probably better face to face, depending on the play group.

This game is a blast!  Probably one of the few games where no one wins most of the time.  Especially fun to set off a 100M warhead in your own country as your "final retaliation".  Spin the dial and hope for a triple the yield result

I list the optimal player numbers as 0 since hopefully I&#039;ll never have to either play this game or watch it get played again.  I bought it because I was under the impression it was a classic.  Nothing could be further from the truth: this game is tedious to the extreme and filled with luck.  Also there is no &quot;propoganda&quot; since everyone starts bombing everyone else right away and all non bomb cards become useles.  Go try the similar but way better &quot;Plague and Pestilence&quot;  Somebody please take this off my hands.

Somebody did take this off my hands, Thanks!!!

I have fond memories of playing this game with friends. I also have fond memories of being around others playing it and improvising everyone's theme music on my acoustic guitar. Yay! We'd all pick which country we were representing and have fun with it.

Yes it's just beer and pretzels, but it's still fun.  Played this a lot in college with a group of friends and we all enjoyed it.  It really helps if you do some trash talking about another players country as you steal his/her population or nuke them.  Overall a silly game but an enjoyable one with the right crowd.

Silly fun.  Almost pure luck, but can still be enjoyable.  Quite often everyone loses (which is kind of the point).
Can also lead to a pretty dumb game; players can easily be eliminated before getting a turn.

While talking about 'balancing' this is semi-insane, I think giving every player one 25 million pop + the rest of their population as normal, and discarding rather than playing secrets from the opening hand, could make the game a lot more enjoyable.

Designed by a teacher to illustrate the point that there is no winning a nuclear war, this isn't a game as much as it is a morality play that forces the audience to come up on stage and confess their sins at gunpoint. Then shoots them in the head.

Very random and chaotic game involving some war gaming and negotiation.

What on the surface appears to be a wargame is actually really a negotiation game, the way you can posture by showing off your power cards is a nice touch.

Very old design with horribly dated components and artwork, some pretty clunky game mechanics at times too. A lot of randomness and can get annoying pretty quickly in games where the cards eliminate you without you having any say at all.

Overall though a fun game in small doses, not to be taken seriously at all.

Sold. I picked this up at Origins when I was there to compete in the Magic Pro Tour Season 1. I did horribly because it was a constructed tournament and I'm a limited player (in game play type and ability =) ).

I just wish I was more into it at the time but Magic and computer/video games would lord over me for another 15 years until I saw the light.

At least I USED to own it. As of this writing, it's somewhere in storage. Last time I played it was nearly ten years ago with a total peace and love hippie chick who had a butterfly patch on the leg of her jeans. There was something funny about watching her calculating the millions of people she killed everytime she played a card. Update: I found it! It was in a box of old books, right next to a dog eared copy of The Illiad. Seems about right.

Beer 'n' pretzels! Who knew nuclear holocaust could be so much fun? This is a hilarious filler game. It takes only about 45 minutes for a full game, and hour tops if you mix all the Population Cards of all sets together and somehow all the 25 million cards are dealt out. It's far likelier that games are shorter, much shorter. You will not get through a play of this without at least a handful of good belly laughs.

Oh, you may also lose this game before you get your first turn.

Online play only.

It's true Nuclear War is totally pointless, but I do see some value in it in which you want an activity to supplement a social gathering.  One that you don't really need to take seriously and function as a distraction from the idle chatter.

Now to get to the other negatives.  While player elimination may be a necessary evil in certain kinds of games, what really irks me is the fact that your population can be wiped out during the setup phase.  That to me is just stupid.  Then there are the problems of kingmaking, ganging up on the leader (or pretty much anyone in general), poor distribution of cards, and a non-sensical dice roll chart for damage.

On second thought, I really don't see much merit in playing Nuclear War at all.

RATING: 9
Random yet hilariously fun card game about a nuclear war. Players "program" their turns 2 turns in advance, placing a third card face down and turning up the topmost card. A launcher followed by a warhead the next turn will cause population loss for a neighbouring country. And the population is also random - cards drawn that vary from 1 million to 25 million inhabitants.

Don't even think about this game if you like game with tactics. This is just a random "take that!" game that's great fun if you know how to enjoy it.

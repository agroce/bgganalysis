RATING: 7.5
Card-driven abstract that has multiple ways to score, a short playing duration, and easy to understand gameplay.

The goal of the game is to score the most points in 4 rounds.  Each round consists of several turns of choosing one of the following actions: 1) add a piece to the board, 2) move a piece on the board, 3) remove another player's piece off the board (a method of scoring points), 4) tearing down buildings (another way to score points), 5) building buildings (the last way to score points), and 6) exchanging cards (which allows you to refresh your valuable wild card).  Each action requires playing at least one card, which are individual colours that correspond to the 4 colours in the game.  The game board itself is a grid of the 4 colours, and these colours serve to limit movement and card play action.  The blocks that make up the buildings are also made of the 4 colours.  A round ends when all but one of a given sized building is left over.

Gameplay is very accessible, the components are very good (except for the small, poor quality cards!!!), and there is enough room for planning and clever moves despite the random card draws (the wild card helps in this aspect).  Unusual in that's it's fun and accessible as it is an abstract, and it seems like it would have been easy to at least tack on a theme.  Hard to find, but definitely a solid game.

Curioso y buen juego abstracto de colocar y apilar bloques y destruir a los del contrario. 2 partidas a 2 y 4 jugadores. Factor suerte alto por las cartas que salen, a pesar del comodín, pero esta muy entrenido el juego y es sencillo de explicar y de jugar.

RATING: 7.5
For some odd reason this game has fallen off the radar of gamers despite its SdJ nomination.  Its an abstract and that could be the problem.  It is also a game that rewards players messing with each others pieces.  The game phases are clear and it appears that moving the game along is principle in play, but it is unwise to ignore the points that can be earned by simply knocking someone else's piece off the board.  Rarely does the 'assault' leave the player bitter as turn-around is and should be fair play.  If you are a fan of abstracts and not timid of some direct player confrontation - give this title a try.

Great abstract game.  It may be played thinking a lot, or in a "fast and furious" way full of speed.  Visual aspect is maybe not too atractive, as if it was a modern art piece.  But components work perfectly for its porpouse.

Abstract game, no nice design. I'm mostly no fan of abstract games and this game doesn't change my meaning. Even for an abstract game, it is a bit unpredictible. Because your cards are renewed very fast and often, you have to change your tactics almost every turn.

*Update* 

After my second play (3 players) I rise my rating from 7 to 8. This is a incredibly fun family game. It's an pleasure to play it. This isn't a brain burner abstract strategy game, because there are some luck involved with the cards you draw...

Intriguing abstract game. The use of cards makes it more unpredictable than other abstract games, but experience is still a factor. The playing time is also satisfyingly short. On the minus side, the game components are quite ugly, specially the pawns, with two player colors being hard to distinguish, at least for me.

RATING: 7
While I'm generally not a fan of abstracts, I do enjoy a good tactical abstract now and then, and this game hits the spot for me in that genre.  While abstracts usually tend to be strategic in nature, Blox is almost entirely tactical.  You can plan a move or two in advance, but that's about it.  There's just something pleasant about this game, and I can't think of any other game that it's terribly similar to.  It scratches a similar itch that Ingenious scratches for me, even though the games aren't at all similar.

The comparisons to Manhattan (I hate Manhattan... the comments that the games are similar almost kept me from trying this game) are unfounded unless you think stacks of blocks are enough to mean the two games are similar.  Overall, a fun little diversion that I'll likely bring out from time to time.

This game is more or less described by the phrase 'abstract for families'. On a checkerboard various stacks of coloured blocks are placed, and on top of those a marker indicating their height (dubbing as point value). Players get a number of cards in their hands and then are required to 'capture' such stacks; after capture the blocks are recycled into bigger stacks. The points you keep, of course. The way the capturing process works is that pawns are moved about on the board: you pay a coloured card to move to the nearest spot with a colour matching that of the played card in order to get close to a stack of your choice; and by discarding cards with colours matching those in the stack you capture it. You do get cards back from a draw pile (introducing a random element) so you can keep on playing.

The game's subject is rather contrived for an abstract, but what really sinks the game for me is the rather silly way in which card draw and blocks interact. In order to capture blocks you need to play cards with the correct colour, but in order to build them again you [i]again[/i] need cards with those colours. So what happens is that the game takes on an annoying capture blocks-stall and collect cards-build blocks cycle which cannot be broken because there are no rules in place to let some colours count for others. It doesn't make much sense to hit on other players' pawns too because you require a large number of cards which may be put to use more efficiently in getting blocks out of your supply. All in all the game feels very contrived and not at all engaging. I'm really not sure why good money was spent to create the appearance that Ravensburger gave it, because it wasn't worth the effort. Unless, of course, I'm really missing something terribly big, but meticulous rules readings have turned up nothing.

Not really for those who prefer hard core abstracts. This one is light --- more family oriented --- and the components are terrific. The card cycling injects enough randomness to turn the game into a tactical affair, but not so much that you'll ever be able to claim legitimately that the cards hosed you. Regardless of the cards in your hand, you will have plenty of options, especially early in the game.

Using color cards to move your pawns around the board, striking down towers with matching color cards, building towers with cards and blocks, and attacking other pawns.   A unique multi-player abstract that moves along nicely due to the randomness of the cards.  I'd play it more, but it probably would wear out fast.

With the ability to attack and remove your opponents pieces, I’m surprise this game wasn’t themed.  Many abstracts tend to be quite dry and boring but the hand management aspect makes it more fun, less analytical.  If you enjoy a good multiplayer abstract, seek this one out.

Blox is a light family-suitable abstract. The box says it's a strategy game but the cards you draw have a huge influence on what you can actually do, so it is actually much more tactical than strategic.

The importance of the card draws increases towards the end when towers get higher and therefore more difficult to construct/demolish.

Abstract game (usually, I'm not a fan) that managed to hold my attention & progress toward a meaningful goal instead of slowing down as the game progressed. It's a card-driven set-collecting game (I know, that stretches the definition of "set-collecting"... but think about it a minute) that was much more enjoyable than the more themed Oregon or Journey to the Centre of the Earth.

A very nice multiplayer abstract where the speed of play and short playtime elevate it above some other multiplayer abstracts. There really aren't that many good multiplayer ones out there so this fills a bit of a niche. 

Definitely suited for family fare although it leans slightly on the heavier side as there are many options available on a persons turn. The main ones are tearing buildings down, erecting new buildings and removing other players off the board which is a nice little screwage effect. It seems to me they took Manhattan and gave it a few twists, it plays quite differently as you can see but it certainly bears many resemblences including a high luck factor with the card draw.  

Room for some clever plays keep it interesting along with the 3 ways to score, purely a tactical affair (planning is out less one turn ahead) that is fun to play and over in about 30 minutes.

I thought this was a challenging game and has a lot of replayability based on the setup, card draw and number of players.  I expected it to take longer than it did, which is good and bad.

It's a shame that they couldn't come up with a viable theme for the game, no matter how thin, since the abstract nature of the game is a little bit of a drawback.

Played quickly, as a family game, it's pretty fun.  Played as an abstract, I can see why some would have a problem with it, as there's definitely some luck involved in the card draws.  I like how quickly the game moves and the types of decisions are interesting.  Despite the abstractness of the game, it feels competitive and tense.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Card driven game "Candyland" style in that your actions are driven by what selection of color cards you have in hand (of which there are four different colors).  Game is very tactical for the most part although you can plan ahead to some degree.  Points are earned by destroying towers (which also give you tiles to build towers later), building towers, or chasing an opponent's pawn off the board.  Generally, this game plays quickly, but if you don't like a little "take that" in the game, this isn't for you as you will be annoyed.  Cards are used/matched to both spaces on the board AND the tower bricks themselves.  Don't be afraid to refresh your hand as your action on your turn and/or reactivate your joker - it will help you immensely in a future turn.

You play cards, you stack blocks but this really is nothing like Manhattan. Blox has no player-to-board orientation rules, Manhattan has no destroying of towers (towers that no one player actually owns, so that's nowhere near as confrontational as it sounds). Blox also plays well with 2 which unfortunately Manhattan doesn't. But then I wouldn't claim Blox is as deep either. This is a quick and interesting abstract, highly tactical but not a lot of room for AP, and well worth checking out. As a personal note, I also think it would have benefitted from some kind of theme - it's not like Kramer hasn't pasted one on before...

Initial rating after 1 play with 3:
Tactical game with fairly simple rules. Plays like an abstract, no apparent theme. Unlike most abstract it has quite a luck factor in card draw.

The game looks rather dull & bland in a very boring way, despite the nice feel of the blox, and the original looking partly see-through pawn.

Gameplay isn't too bad, but nothing new either. Best thing is that it plays pretty fast, so there's not much downtime.

Nothing bad, just very mediocre. Might have been great 20 years ago. Wouldn't suggest to bring it on table, but would play if someone wanted to.

Considero a Blox el juego familiar perfecto, ahí es nada. Es tremendamente entretenido, sencillo y bonito a rabiar. Dudo que este juego pueda disgustar a alguien. Y con la segunda partida el juego ya se domina lo suficiente como para echarte unas buenas risas. Tiene una primera parte de puteo, ya que al principio sale más a cuenta destruir al prójimo que dedicarse a la construcción de bloques y una segunda parte en la que nos dedicaremos más a construir. Y ese look setentero es genial y funcional, aunque las fotos no le hacen justicia. Increíble que esté tan abajo en la BGG y que no se llevase el  Spiel des Jahres del 2008, no debían querer darle a Kramer su sexto SdJ.

Nice abstract and highly interactive (and slightly cutthroat!) family game in which players manipulate blocks on a grid via card play.

RATING: 5
First impression (3 players): The game is a pure abstract. The rules are simple and components are quite nice hard plastic but not very pretty. The game is all about optimizing your moves to be efficient but as you need cards to do it you have to deal with luck as well. 

Optimization is a bit too mechanical perhaps. You want to avoid being eaten and you want to be able to use any card combination you happen to draw to be efficient. If possible you can eat another players piece. Basically there is nothing seriously wrong with the game. It actually is one of the better light abstracts (for 3 players at least) for casual play. There is a bit of luck but it doesn't feel to be too much. There is enough player interaction but again not too much so you can plan ahead and it isn't too chaotic. I just personally dislike abstract games a bit compared to something with a working theme. Blox is a easy-to-play game mechanically but It would have needed something more to get me excited about it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
For a family game, the setup is a bit longish, and the gameplay dry and mechanical. The components are a bit on the cheap side, and the colors are dull, so a game in progress looks quite uninteresting. I don't see this having much success on the mass market because of the unappealing looks.

The game is pretty much about trying to score as often as possible, through a simple hand management scheme, and using a minimal amount of move actions. There are some possibilities for clever moves, especially for removing other players' pawns from the board. But, since the maximum score for one hand card is one point, the game left me wanting just a bit more leeway for ingenious player performance.

Rated 7 after two playings. Rating might drop to 6 after further playings, since the game left me feeling that it might not have too much replay potential, at least for me.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Due to its austere look and lack of a theme it's more or less understandable that Blox wasn't a huge success when it came out, but that doesn't make it less unfair: it's an extremely dynamic, card-driven board game in which a relatively simple, colour-based mechanism applies equally to building towers, demolishing them, introducing and moving own pieces and attacking enemy pieces to remove them off the board. With these tools players have got to gather as many points as possible by setting on old towers and reusing their building blocks to build taller ones; an action can be carried out every turn as long as a player has got the right cards to do so. The hand is replenished at the end of the turn.

Even if the random draws of cards and the seemingly arbitrary positions of the initial towers in the game suggest a chaotic game (well... if that's not enough, the building blocks of these initial towers are up to the players' choice), there is hardly a turn in which a player can't do anything of use. Apart from the four phases with different height limits for building and demolishing towers there are no boundaries on how a game evolves - there is thus hardly any strategy but tons of tactics instead, may it be fighting over towers or backstabbing opponents. All at a frantic pace, no matter for how many players.

A nice time-filler.  Has enough back-stabbery to be fun.  Abstract.

Blox -- Played once; three-player.

I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this.  Abstracts can really drag for me, but Blox has a built-in time limit (sort of).  By this I mean that towers can only be built to exactly the height which can be removed only in the following phase.  When the final phase is reached, any towers you build are too tall to be removed, so only pre-existing towers can be removed, thereby depleting the supply of removable towers and accelerating the game-end condition.  

The ability to refresh your wild card (by using your turn to flush some cards from your hand) made the game more forgiving.  The ability to remove one of another player's tokens from the board might seem too malicious, but in fact it proved strategically significant.  For example, when I had a token next to a tower I was going to demolish on my next turn, Eric removed my token, took my token's position and demolished that tower on his next turn.  Such a move is only possible when tokens are properly aligned and when at least three of the five cards in the active player's hand are of one color.  This gives a player something to do with a rather lopsided hand, and it's not necessarily devastating to the player whose token is removed.  (Of course, this assumes the player has the foresight to put all his tokens on the board, so one missing token is a manageable misfortune. -- I did not have that foresight!)

The cards are a nice heavy stock.  The tower pieces are bakelite, and the color-matching between tower pieces, cards, and board is quite good.  Well produced!

Played two-player, it was straightforward and fun. Not Earth-shaking, but clean and quick.

A really nice little game!

There are random stacks of blocks on the board. Players have 4 pieces which they can introduce/move around the board. Movement is based on cards matching the colors of the squares on the board. You can destroy a stack or create a stack or remove an opponent's pawn using the right combination of cards and board position. Each of these things gives you victory points in varying amounts -- the trick is to best position yourself for multiple opportunities, and manage your hand of cards most efficiently.

It was deeper than I was expecting for a Spiel des Jahres nominee ... definitely worth playing!

Too dry and abstract to float my boat.  Also, the card draws add perhaps too much luck for this type of brain exercise.  I rarely win at games like this, so maybe I shouldn't complain!

Rating based on one play. An interesting, but weird abstract game with a healthy dose of luck. The cards make this a highly tactical game, as they pretty much decide your possible moves. There is some forward planning involved, but never more than one or two turns ahead. Would like to play again.

I give Blox points for originality.  A nice multiplayer abstract in the "board of squares" family, enlivened by interesting colors and scorekeeping.

RATING: 8
A weird game (in a good way). The gameplay is totally themeless, but the aesthetic with the strong colors and nice tactile blocks is really good. Its very easy to play and has a light feel, but rewards planning ahead and careful action management. You can knock other player's pieces off the board, but its too light and casual to feel confrontational.
Overall a very fun game.

One of my favorites. Highly underestimated game!
Yes, it's abstract and it's mainly hand management. But the design is elegant and fun. Efficiency and keeping options open is key. I think it hits a good spot by being light but still somewhat strategic.
The plastic bricks are of good quality.
The abstract look of the board and the generic name seem to hurt its attractiveness, but it's a really good game!

This game exceeded my expectations, which were fairly high to begin with. It plays very quickly and there is a decent amount of skill in the game. One definitely needs to plan ahead and prevent an opponent from taking control of an area of the board. Components, while not the nicest of colors, are extremely durable. I wish the cards were normal card size instead of the small ones found in TtR since the cards need to be shuffled a few times during the game. This is a very solid abstract game that probably is good for families with older children. Very straightforward to play, but there are some detailed, specific rules to master (gotta have a player aid for the first couple of games).

Great game. Use your cards to attack a player or capture a stack of Blox or build a stack. Except you only have 4 cards at a time and you need to maximize each turn. Tough but fun.

A cool abstract game with very unusual mechanisms, but luck of the draw, and situational fortune weigh pretty heavily in it.  The blocks themselves are awesome, solid resin, with ridges and grooves so they stack nicely.

RATING: 7.5
With a little more rules/options than an good reference abstract (Dvonn/Einfach/Quoridor/Blokus) this is a well designed refreshing game for even the non abstract lovers.
Nice bits spite purple(red?) and brown colour confusion could be avoided.
Luck of draw makes it more similar to Einfach.
****
Um pouco mais complexo em relação às regras do que um bom abstracto. Com o factor sorte das cartas a estragar o desafio de um "toda a informação conhecida" mas a dar-lhe encanto e leveza para cativar mais tipos de pessoas.
Bom gateway para crianças a partir dos 8/10 anos.

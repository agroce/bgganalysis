RATING: 6.7
Well... it's area control so I didn't have high hopes anyhow. People say it's Euro-y but to me felt deckbuilder-ish. Lots of combining card features and choosing which tactical combination to use in a given situation. It's not terrible and I see why people like it but I won't be playing again anytime soon.

More accessible and streamlined than its predecessor Chaos in the Old World, but loses some depth and tension as a result. It's also possible for players to be noticeably knocked out of contention very early on. Still an enjoyable romp I'm happy to play on occasion.

First play:1\23\16 2 and a half hours (3 people did research on the game, 4th was in for a game at the last minute, all had not played before.)

I rated it a 10 in December 2015, (after watching videos, I was psyched!) so I rated it a 10 before playing, Was I hasty? 

NO! It was that good! 

Oh yeah, I forgot to say I WON AT 125 points! (every one else gave me loki cards in the draft.) 

I got 4 figures destroyed in Ragnorok (16) times 2 for double all glory in by dying in Ragnorok. then I had 3 glory each person released from Valhala (2 cards) 8 people released (24) those two things were almost half my victory! 

phenomenal combos, leading into an awesome game!

I was unsure if I'd like this game and I was wanting to avoid the hype. On trying it I am glad I did. Blood rage is fun throughout. I knew the game and I knew the theory of the three main strategies (quest/kill/die) but still lost to new comers. The hardest part is picking a strategy and sticking to it when so many of the cards are so exciting and fun to play.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Blood Rage is one of the few area control with action points allowance system & card drafting that I like, because even in death I can still gain glory! It doesn't take long time to finish, the rules are streamlined & easy to understand though there are few cards that's a bit confusing, plus the minis are super awesome! The clans are all cosmetic only with no variable clan power but I still wish for the Ram clan hahaha! The game reminds me of Cosmic Encounter, Game of Thrones, Smallworld & King of Tokyo.

Very good game, but it's pretty random until everyone is familiar with the cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I'm only rating it this high because I'm aware that one play is not enough to fully judge any game, but man did I not have a good time. Aside from the standard thing of not knowing what any of the other cards were (much less how they fit into the game), you can still only get a heads up on ~2/3rds of all the cards in the draft. Even if you do know what your opponent has, you can easily find yourself strategically blocked off by their combination of cards and positioning, leaving you mostly unable to score in the 3rd age.

Maybe it'd get better with more plays, in which case I'll update this. But holy hell was that a bad first impression.

Finally got a play this one at Gen Con with gods and mystics expansions. Great fun! I recall playing the previous incarnation Midgard and remarked how wonderful it was in mechanics. Well, it holds up well for sure - and the dress up by Cool Mini certainly adds to the flare and fun. Very fun drafting (a mechanic I find I don't often like), wonderful power ups and area/battle control where dying itself is often to your benefit! The gods expansion adds variety, so good all around. Lots of love.

RATING: 5.5
Un juego muy sobrevalorado (porque entra por los ojos por las minis), y sobretodo, un despropósito total al estar troceado entre expansiones que lo hace valer una salvajada. Sólo he probado el juego base, y cualquier otro juego de mayorías al que he jugado le da mil patadas a éste. Hay cosas absurdas y el azar está bastante presente y descompensado, en el tema de las cartas.

El del Padrino, del mismo autor, es más sencillo y a la vez el juego está más pulido y es mejor (o al menos más divertido)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Blood Rage sure has cool miniatures (or not). Mounting the minis onto a removable bases of varying colours is also a neat solution to denote the owner of the monster. Rules are rather simple and the game can be started quite quickly. 

It is nice that you decide your strategy on the basis of the initial card draft. Thus you can play differently from game to game, sometimes you even have to if you do not get the cards needed for a certain strategy. I also liked that there are two more drafting rounds, when you can make changes to your strategy if needed, or push even further along the path you chose initially.

However, already after the first game everyone in our group felt that we had seen every trick you can pull off during a game, take a few we could not think of. I was not left with an urge to play again to try something different. I take this as a sign of a rather one dimensional game. Yes, the play was fun but it is a shame if you "crack" the code at the first play.

One more thing worth mentioning is the absolutely horrible choice of font. Despite being printed in big and bold the names of the areas are really difficult to read.

The conclusion says that Blood Rage is a nice game but I am afraid it is rather short lived, unless expansions introduce some longevity elements to it.

I can see why some people might prefer it with 4, but I enjoyed very much my first play with my girlfriend. I guess we're going to love it even more after we become more accustomed to the cards. for instance, I wasted the first age after my girlfriend played that card that steals rage after a fight and i had only kept 1 rage....next time i'm going to be a lot more careful

A fantastic game. While I still love Chaos in the Old World, Blood Rage has largely replaced it as I didn't feel like I needed to own both. Eric Lang really nailed the design on this one, and you can see a lot of the best elements from CitOW showing up here. The art and especially the miniatures are beautiful as well, which is always a big plus.

7 is based on first play with 2. 

Some interesting mechanics, but I found the game fairly light relative to my tastes. We'll see how this changes after a few more playthroughs and at diff player counts, but I found the game went way too quickly and was pretty anticlimactic.

Maybe I was just expecting too much given the hype and long wait for this... My husband enjoyed it quite a bit.

RATING: N/A
Was neat, and there was a lot of room for good moves, great moves, and dbag moves.  The clan stats seemed to be a lost or underutilized opportunity, as they did not impact gameplay very much at all during the one play.

The negative plays felt really painful to the receiver and not that exciting for the one making the play.  Unfortunately, this one feeling means that I do not need to own this, and I'm not sure I need to keep playing it.

Intuitive game with drafting, action-point allowance system and area-control. I really enjoy playing this game even though I am not very good at it. 

I like that there are many different ways to score points in this game. Some tactics even revolve around dying in a region. The skill in the game is to draft a good combination of cards and to use them at the right time. This is not easy as you also have other priorities on the map.

The game works well with both 2, 3 and 4 players. I think I prefer it with 4 though because of the more caotic nature of it. I have not played it with 5, but  I will do as soon as I get my hands on the 5th player expansion. Maybe it is better than 4, or maybe it is too much chaos. Who knows?

I am really looking forward to get more plays out of this game.

RATING: 8
1st play: This game feels related to Chaos in the Old World, which makes sense given the designer.  The drafting is good, and the production values are amazing.  I'm not a big fan of "exclusive" content, especially when it feels like that exclusive content is probably necessary to have a complete game.  I'm not sure if it's a game that will have a ton of replay, depending on how much control over the types of cards you can get.

2nd play: This game was excellent the second time.  Having an idea of what could be played added an additional depth to the game, and the mystics were worthwhile to add.  I'm still not a fan of the exclusive content, but the game was great overall.  Drafting was tight and I saw new paths to victory I had missed the first time through.  Quite excellent.

It is a good game, not great design, not original, does the job well, fit well with the theme, but it is impossible not to compare it with kemet, chaos in the old world or cthulhu wars, they all do the job right, but they are all not impressive.

I really liked the presentation of this game and the great possibilities of winning the game not winning fights, but losing fights and being in Vallalla.

OK, so this hurts. I was really looking forward to this, and the table of players was chock full of people I really like.

Imagine my disappointment when this glorious viking area control drafting game was a bit of a dud. Everything works and it holds together, as well as looking great, but I didn't feel a sense of excitement about the whole thing.

So in that sense, it's less "Ragnarok", than "The Dark World".

I had a good time thanks to the players, though, which really is all that counts. Jason wiped the floor with us, though.

This is a broken game. You win this game every time if you get all your players into the Ragnarök and lose the most battles. Winning battles is the worst thing you could do as a Viking Warrior apparently... The theme of the game does not work at all with the mechanics and scoring.

RATING: 8
This would make a 9 except the game has some overpowered combos. I understand that in a drafting game it is dependent on the other players to keep this in check, but since I so often play my games with new players, they will not notice that they are passing some 'broken' combos to a player. If this happens it can suffer from a runaway leader scenario. Still gets an 8 because with 4 players it is faster to play than it looks.

That can be said for most games though so its a minor complaint. I never turn down a chance to bring this one out!

Another KS with a lot of eye-candy but a game that seems to be a wargame but is more of a worker-placement Euro.

CMON makes very good looking games, the miniatures are awesome - but that's that. The design is by someone else and one can see it. Has some serious flaws when combining the base game with the (KS-) expansions concerning card combos.

Sorry, no game for me.

I liked this WAY more than I expected to. The draft is delicious and presents some difficult choices, and allows for some planning as well. The area control works well, death has some sting but it never feels mean, and you can turn losses into wins if you plan it well. The blind card play for combat feels very fair as well, since losers get their cards back, and the cards have enough trickeration that you can never be fully sure what the right play is. Leveling up your clan seems to be important above all else, I got +50 pts from level bonuses at game's end, which was nearly half my points. Our quests had people working different areas, would be interesting to see more overlap, although we had PLENTY of conflict. Would be down to play again any time.

also: this is one of the few games I would recommend a broken token for. You aren't getting the expansions in the box without it

Blood Rage is at heart a streamlining of Lang's earlier Chaos in the Old World with the action transferred to a world of Norse mythology. The competing Viking clans are undifferentiated at the start, but gradually grow more asymmetric through the drafting of upgrades.  The game is less about area control than its forefather; only drafted quest cards reward it.  The focus has switched to winning battles, progressing along three tracks and sending souls to Valhalla.  Some card combos do seem very powerful and there is less variety in the cards than I'd have hoped (a consequence of streamlining?).  All the same, it plays quite smoothly, the tight limits on area occupancy reward forward planning, and the shrinking play area ensures plenty of conflict.

I like the artwork and the minis are very good indeed. The one misstep is the clan of chainmail bikini clad Viking babes.

This game is very good,but the great problem of this game (in my opinion) is,that the quantity of the cards is small and there are few good cards.Also in this game I didn't get the feeling of making your own strategy,but to do a random strategy by coincidence from the actions of the other players.

:arrowE: [u]Synopsis[/u]:
An everyone-is-equal area control game that grows more and more asymmetric as players draft unique cards around the table over three rounds. Glory equals victory points, and glory is won both from winning [i]and[/i] losing battles, completing area control quests, sinking ships, slaying monsters, and pumping up the traits of your battle clan. Don't be fooled, this is not brainless Ameritrash. In fact, it's one of the most finely-honed hybrid games I've ever played.

:arrowE: [u]What I like most[/u]:
I love drafting. But I like drafting the most when it makes sense thematically. 7 Wonders? That doesn't make sense. Sushi Go Party!? That makes a lot of sense. Blood Rage? That makes a lot of sense, too. Players are clans who are effectively bidding for favor from the gods of the Norse pantheon at Ragnarok--these gods need the help of the players to close the end of time, and they dole out their boons to the players on a first-come, first-served basis. Do you want to summon all of the most amazing elemental monsters of the realm? Draft the monster cards from the gods. Do you want to fall on your sword/axe/pike and still gain glory? Draft the Loki cards. Do you want to make your name great in the annals of forgotten history? Draft the Odin cards. Each game I play, it seems as though the progressive asymmetry of the drafting really evokes the desperate theme of the world coming to an end, with only so many able warriors and tacticians left to usher in the apocalypse. In addition to the thematic/mechanical consistency, combat is simple, but also affords an excellent bluffing aspect through card play. This game is FAST, but packs in a ton of tension, player interaction, and satisfying moments within the system.

:arrowE: [u]What I like least[/u]:
Like any asymmetrical game, the fabric of the table can become increasingly fragile if players do not understand no only their own strategy and tactics, but those of their opponents. If the Loki-heavy player is taunting you to pillage so they can send all of their units to die, don't pillage. Quest instead, and deny that player his obvious setup. That said, this weakness for potential fragility is also the greatest strength of the game, as the progressing asymmetry can be incredible if crunched by savvy players.

A huge disappointment for me. I am giving it a 7 because it is a legitimately good game, but the game has some base mechanic issues which can allow for a run away leader problem. I need to play it at least once or twice more before I am sure of my feelings on it, but at least for now I feel like the game has a misleading burden of knowledge that can make the game get out of control.

This doesn't strike me as a particularly thematic game. At least not enough to have made it to rank 11 in that domain. Seems overrated on most other accounts, too. Too unpredictable for my taste. What would this be rated if it used tokens or wood pieces instead of minis?  I think the amazing miniatures are skewing the perceptions and ratings of Blood Rage. For this type of game, I prefer Kemet.

I don't really understand what this game is trying to do. It has great miniatures, but it's  not really a miniatures game. It's a card drafting game that happens to have miniatures. If you know the card pool the best, it is most likely that you will combo out with your draft, and then tend to win. There doesn't seem to be much board strategy beyond that.

In my view, (one of) the game(s) of the decade. As I said to Eric Lang (who I had the great honour to talk to at the Spiel 2015): In my eyes already a classic. Different, fresh, exciting, tricky, smooth, full of flavour... I could go on forever. If there was an 11 to give, I'd rate it 11 and then some. Buy! Play! Enjoy!

A game about battling Vikings is something I'm predisposed to be lukewarm about. I don't like direct conflict games, especially of the dice chucking, conquest and fighting over territory variety. Blood Rage is none of those things. It's not even really about Vikings but rather a fantasy Norse mythology world. The game is essentially a euro where you draft cards in order to build combos and point-gaining engines, and then tactically move around pieces on a limited map to gain said points. Fighting is better described as "area majority" and often you don't even want to win. Might be a little too chaotic and random for my liking (and I'm usually fond of a healthy dose of both). The main downside is that if (like me) you don't care about miniatures, the minis make the game far more expensive than I'd normally want to pay for a game like this.

I played this game once. After the first of 3 rounds, I honestly thought we had the rules incorrect, as the game was so bad that I was certain that we had missed something.

The only reason this game is rated so well is because of the miniatures. This is the worst game I have ever played within the strategy genre.

Another euro game in disguise. No dice rolling and lots of card drafting makes this an interesting area control game where you can really customize your viking clan. The game ramps up with more possible points later in the game, sometimes making the first few rounds feel kind of less important though.

This has to be one on the funnest games I have ever played.  In my opinion is is a mid-weight game that play in about 90 minutes with 4 players.  It's easy to pickup as the rules are straight forward and intuitive.  Some of the features I like best are:
- Starts symmetrical and uses card drafting to become asymmetrical
- Multiple strategies for winning
- Has tactical as well as longer term strategy play
- Very balanced, good play is rewarded, while mistakes and setbacks don't elliminate you
- Theme is strong and really adds to the mindset and fun
- The minis add to the gameplay

Splendid game for those who don't want to "build civilizations", "save the princess" or "deliver goods to another area", but prefer slaughter and pillaging! If that's you, Blood Rage comes to your aid, with very easy to understand logic but enough variety of cards/choice of action to make the game exciting. Great artwork on the cards and game board, and absolutely gorgeous minis (I've just done 2 clans and some monsters). If you are into painting the figures and are good at it, you'll have a work  of art game. It's not too complex to exasperate a player yet not too simple, it's just right. Not surprised at all that it was made by teh same guy who did my favourite Chaos in the Old World.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I love it, a semi-euro with card drafting and gorgeous miniatures. I'd say the main downside here is the strength of the "losing" strategy when playing with newer players. i.e. new players do not know to avoid/deny the losing/Loki player's strategy and often feed them a large amount of points. (I've seen scores exceed 220 points)

Great game. Very engaging and pleasant to see and play. It plays fast after the drafting phase (which may drag a little depending on your playgroup). There are many paths to victory which is also very good. The haters of it, accuse for its high luck factor and its broken combos. Luck factor is there, yes, but when the 70% of the games out there have dice, you cant really whine about luck in this game. As for the combos, at first it may look like it, but then you realize that there are many different powerful combinations which eventually balance the game.

One aborted play during which we discovered that we were misplaying - losers in battle, as well as winners, were discarding cards. Oops! Made the game a blowout against the last-place player, who had been effectively betting it all and losing. Anyway, I think the game works, and that it has the right balance of simplicity and chrome. I'm a sucker for card drafting. But a subsequent replay made me feel like there just wasn't the much to it. And the card combos made me feel like it would get min-maxed a la Chaos in the Old World, except I'd rather play that game anyway.

It is possible to win without winning a single battle. It seems like you want to control areas to pillage, but all the vikings happily waltzing off to ragnarok also works.

I've really been looking forward to playing Blood Rage.  We finally got our first play in and it did not disappoint.  Love it.  Learning the cards and combos is key to this game.  Multiple avenues to gain points.  Death in this game is not necessarily a bad thing depending on what cards you have and how you play.  Really interesting.  Initial rating is high but this has the potential to go higher.

Great artwork, great miniatures, but more importantly, Blood Rage is a fine example of how to throw together several mechanics like drafting and area control into a cohesive, functional whole that is frankly pretty simple to teach to others. Now, that said, I'm not quite as blown away by this as most seem to be, but if you're searching for RISK-ish variant with smooth design, solid theme, fun drafting, and killer components, it's well worth the money. Does get a little better with the expansions.

12/10/16:  It's a euro (or weuro), albeit with fantastic pieces.  I'm glad I got to play it but I don't feel compelled to own it.  Whenever I play it, it will be with those that already own the game.  Also there were some kickstarter exclusive sculpts that I don't need to pay premium prices for.

The player colors were not tested very well.  In low incandescent (yellow) light you cannot tell the difference between the brown and the purple colors.

I wonder how many people give this game 8-10 stars just because the nice miniatures and not because of the actual game. Also i believe many people really WANT this game to be better than it is, peuple have payed a lot and invested a lot of hope in the game. 

It’s a nice game. My main complaint is that one pays such a heavy price. I guess that’s becuase of the plastic figures. However they don’t improve the actual gameplay, and for this price I would actually like a somewhat better game. I guess this is a lesson for me about that price can be absurd if there is plastic figures, but that the game in itself might not be THAT good. I feel like many might give it such high score because of the plastic figures.

Also, i wish there was a way to buy the monsters from the kickstarter, in an expansion. Because, why not, always fun to paint. Though ofcthey would nor really improve gameplay. Will definitely try the gods of asgard, because, again; why not.

What's all the fuss about?  It's area control with admittedly sweet minis.  If it was cubes instead, no one would give a toss.

I've concluded that card drafting games are memory games - which just aren't my thing ,,,, b/c I am horrible at them.  I confess that I do like all of the mechanics, the theme, the bits (phenomenal, art included) - but they just don't add up to fun for me here. People drop cataclysmic card combos that are (for the most part) completely out of your control.  I don't mind being struck by a natural disaster, but I prefer a hurricane over an earth quake.  At least a hurricane shows up on radar & gives you time to prepare.  Earthquakes are just throwing your hands in the air and thinking wtf?

Cool game (to say the least, just after a 2p game). Easy to explain rule-wise, although difficult to grasp the exact possibilities (it should tone down after having seen all the cards multiple times after a few game sessions). It sure is not a 2p game of course though, so didn't get the full feeling of the game. It definitely plays within the advertised time (it took me 1h20min including rules explanation) which is a great plus for a Risk-like game that doesn't want to overstay its welcome. All in all, not a fantastic or innovative game as people might say (Dice-tower dudes, i'm looking your way) but one that I can easily see myself bringing on the table every now and then (as long as my girlfriend is not playing, she craved for blood after our session, particularly mine since I won :P )

First Play 11/29/15

This game is fantastic.  However, I should not that it is easy for someone to min-max in a two player game.  This doesn't make the game bad, it just makes it easy for someone to plow right over the board.

Second Play 11/30/15

This game is still fantastic but the idea of min-maxing is still possible.  The game was a bit more intense this time, but still a min-maxing possibility.  Two player games are much more interesting because there are three destroyed areas at the beginning instead of the one area in the four player game.  Also, we noticed that both the fire giant and the sea serpent are not available in the two player game which took something away.  So I am looking forward to playing this game with four people.

Blood Rage is an (interactive) euro disguised as ameritrash.

The rules are very streamlined: the game lasts three Ages (rounds), and each has five phases. The core of the game are the first two: drafting god's rewards cards, and alternating in taking actions (like play cards, deploy or move miniatures, pillage provinces).

Each player has a clan, and everything is symmetrical at the beginning, but during play every clan takes its own shape in something unique (it is kinda Chaos in the Old World where you build the asymmetry instead of beginning the game with it...).

An interesting game, lighter than it seems, and very enjoyable.

Initial Impression: I'm very impressed with the quality of the production of this game. The artwork drips theme, the cards are sturdy, and the miniatures are some of the best I've ever seen. The game is an interesting mix of mechanisms, adding area control with card drafting. This game has a fairly short playtime and progresses with a nice tempo. Turns are quick, leaving everyone feeling engaged throughout the entire experience. I particularly love the multiple ways in which to earn VPs, which are not simply limited to being the victor in combat. Overall, this is a great package and fun game.

A fantastic game.  I absolutely love it, even though I don't often win (maybe once?).

That being said, I really am a sucker for the absolutely amazing minis - and I have almost my whole set painted at this point... still working on a couple of the clans.  I think adding the Gods expansion will help make it even more replayable, but I just haven't gotten there yet.

I really do enjoy Blood Rage, but I have a complaint that is serious enough to bring this down to a 7/10 - there just isn't enough variety in the deck of cards you draft, which holds this otherwise great game back.

Having played this I can now see what the fuss is about.  The minis are amazing and the game is consistently fun.  Very battle and majority oriented but loads of ways to get points without winning things.  I do think that lots of variety of monsters enhances the game and it is a shame so many are kickstarter only but still a great game.  Not my usual style but it made a nice change.  I love drafting in games.

The game involves a lot of drafting and area control. The components are good, with the mini's being excellent. Honestly, the game doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion. The game isn't deep enough and lacks a certain finesse. The good thing is, gameplay seems to be pretty quick. I'm reserving additional thoughts until I can play again.

RATING: 8
This is a quick and light strategy game. Very easy to introduce new people to. I like the drafting. And there's virtually no luck, which I also like.

I've heard people rave about how good the miniatures are. They look cool. But they are really difficult to differentiate. And the individual player boards and cards are made of thick paper rather than cardboard which is disappointing.

RATING: 8.5
3 player game, Brian, Brett and I. Brett had played once before and pretty much wiped the floor against us. I ended with a paltry 27 Glory. Obviously, the strategy here is completely dependent on the cards you draft. The Clan Upgrades in particular were super useful (ex. Pillage an already Pillaged area again). The Monsters seemed not as powerful as I would have thought. Maxing out your Rage stat early also seems to be a must strategy. Need to give this some more plays to see if it grows on me. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Chasing multiple paths to victory as the world ends- what more could one ask for? The Viking theme fits so well, and the small map makes for epic battles over small spits of land as you and your opponents fight for superiority in area control, battle dominance, and even DEATH. The choice of which gods, upgrades and monsters to call upon for favor in the initial draft frames your turn, and the fun of the game is bringing those plans to fruition. This game is a huge accomplishment.

I will readily admit I lost my first game of Blood Rage by an enormous number of points.  That night, I lost several hours of sleep playing out new strategies that I could try the next time I played the game.  The only problem: I didn't even own the game yet!  This became a must-buy and easily one of the best games I have ever played.  Eric Lang figured out how to perfectly balance Euro mechanics with Amerithrash direct conflict.  Amazing!

Blood Rage is a drafting/hand management/area control game with a Viking theme.  It implements the theme well.  Combat is encouraged and essential for victory.  Multiple paths to victory ensure the game plays differently every time.  Enjoyed it.

I was resistant to the hype, but this is a great game. A area of control/drafting game masquerading as a combat game, it is surprisingly easy to teach. There is something incredibly gratifying about slamming your giant monster down on the board as well.

Fun factor rating...

This is usually not my type of game, but the fun factor when playing with family and friends is high... The drafting is interesting once you know the cards; the minis are very nicely done; the artwork is gorgeous and the gameplay is solid for what it is. Bring your big boy pants because you are going to be killed in battle a lot! It is an area control and "take that" game that plays quickly once the rules overhead is gone. 

Fun stuff!

What a fantastic game! This is a really well designed dudes-on-a-map game that offers up a lot of thought. There are a surprising number of ways to go about getting points, and there is way more going on than just combat which wasn't what I expected before buying the game. I love that you're never out of this game either. I've seen some really well done Age 3 comebacks. Fun from start to end and does well at all player counts.

Middle weight game, that mixes something similar to area control, with drafting and tableau building. There are amazing combos. Some of these seam unbalanced. Since the cards are drafted, you could sabotage combos, but to do this you need to know the game. But playing multiple rounds of a game, that may take 3 hours, to find out if it is fun?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Being able to make a bet against losing battles and have that as a workable strategy for winning this game really makes this game worthwhile. It's hard to feel like you aren't advancing a strategy so long as you're keeping your wits about you. The setup time is long, but the learning curve isn't punishingly steep, so you can set up a game, and after you learn the game, get right into the meat of the action, which is nice.

RATING: 10
Up front, as of writing this, this is my favorite game of all time. So this will just be a list of things I love about the game. Amazing artwork and implementation of one of my favorite themes (vikings). Excellent miniatures, especially the monsters, which by the way, can be yours to control! The miniatures in this game actually made me get into painting miniatures. Drafting for battle cards, upgrades, controllable monsters, and goals for the round all occur at the same time, which leads to people being able to do the strategy they want to do. This game is about getting glory (vikings would be proud) rather than simply winning battles. While winning battles is certainly a good thing, there is plenty of opportunity to get glory by dying in battle, or better yet, in the glorious destruction that is Ragnarok.

Honestly this game appeals to Amerithrash and eurominded gamers alike, and while there is a little too much going on for those who avoid a decent amount of strategy,  most gamers will get this quickly, and will leave with a mixture of satisfaction and longing for that one move back, followed by the desire to get right back into it. I find myself thinking about my plays long afterward and wanting to play again and again.

RATING: 6
This game converted very many of my friends into devoted board game players with growing collections.

Simple enough to understand quickly and the action happens RIGHT AWAY.

Because of this - I want to give it a straight up 10, but it's not quuiiiite complex enough for me and I've also just been straight up ganged up on for many rounds in a row during a few different plays - if that happens when your not prepared with any of the glory/don't lose a guy when you die cards ahead of time there's not a whole lot you can do about it, and then suddenly your 30+ points behind and your night's ruined.

At least in other war-ish games there's something meaningful you can still do if your just being triple-team curb-stomped...So for that, it gets a lower rating.

Another possible issue is that the art looks so 'metal' that it turns away more of my hippy friends.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
What a fun game! Lots of miniatures, and (comparatively) quick easy rules. Could just play it again and again and still get such a kick out of it. Everyone having an all out fight when someone attempts to pillage the center is fantastic, get so caught up in having fun I forgot to win.

Only bad point is that it was a Kickstarter filled with exclusives... that I missed. It does seem the extras added to the gameplay experience and they are very hard/expensive to come across. So there is no real chance of me enhancing my game... which is a damned shame and an oversight by CoolMiniOrNot as they could have got more money out of me!

I kept hearing Blood Rage was a revamp of Chaos in the Old World and as such I had high expectations from it: sadly, they were all let down the first time I played it. Blood Rage turned out as a dumbed down - and by far not an improved - version of the Warhammer game.

For all practical purposes, it’s an eurogamer’s combat game: that is, a game where players can plan almost everything, go for damage reduction rather than putting everything they have into winning and even arrange a defeat in combat from scratch just because losing a pillage grants them as many points as dominating it, if not more.

As a matter of fact losing battles rather than winning them looks like the best strategy in this game: now, I wonder, how can a combat game reward defeat - and a planned one, for that - more than success?

The simple answer is, it’s a game for those who have no risk appetite: not only is taking risks uneffective here but it also usually backfires as the rules want to prevent you from taking any risk. Unthematically enough, you are not allowed to act rashly but you are required to carefully optimize your every move.
Think, baby, burn your little brain and let the other players wait endlessly for your move. Does it sound any fun to you?

The lack of any dice rolls - that would add some needed randomness in combat - and the annoying card drafting at the beginning of each era as a way to even out the impact of a lucky or unlucky hand simply strengthen this feeling, as they both reward the intricacies woven by the strategically awarer players only: if you’re looking for interaction, theme and epic battles, Blood Rage is not the game for you.

Initial Impressions:
--------------------
The card drafting in this one is fantastic.  Probably the most interesting area control I have ever played.  The mini's for this game are insane (especially the monster mini's).  I would be shocked if this does raise to a 10 rating with more plays.  I would also be shocked if this isn't my favorite game from 2015.  Just a fantastic game.  Eric Lang's best by far!

This is an odd game that I am enthusiastic to play again. It's odd in that the thematic world of the minis, card text and narrative is so coherent but there the connection to the very mathy, combo mechanics seems to be more tenuous than would be expected given what you see when you open the box. Actually playing the game feels a bit like a direct confrontation version of Race for the Galaxy (a game I like a lot)...there is a lot of min/maxing, searching out combos, trying to figure out the chain of when to play certain card combos for maximum point gain. Rarely do I feel like saying, "Roar!" when I put a troll on the board or that I am pillaging when I pillage. As a mathy confrontation game is without question excellent and one I will enjoy playing in the future. The lack of immersion will just keep it from being a ten for me given my penchant for thematic games.

This game just never clicked for me. Couldn't afford to buy the monsters I so badly wanted to play with, couldn't build any sort of strategy with the cards I ended up with, and once one player started winning, they completely ran away with the game, meaning the scoring track was just another reminder of how little I could do. While it doesn't look like it from the box, this is primarily a card game, really.

After one play i can´t understand the good ratings (ok the figures are pretty done). Beside this, the theme fails a bit for me, better implementation seems Fire&Axe, because the northern mythologie does it not well enough with getting points for Valhalla (a kind of village with his death rewards?). Every player needs his kind of a game, but for me it´s hardly acceptable that a loser of a battle gets a bunch of Victory points.

Despite the hype around Blood Rage, I personally have found it wanting. The production is excellent, and the mechanics are fun. However, the game just feels pointless and unsatisfying at the end. Maybe it's the Ragnarok theme wherein the world ends and everybody dies, but even that kinda misses the mark as most of the board is still intact at the end.
This game is a smorgasbord of gaming elements...card drafting, upgrading, area control, and bluffing, combined with Euro scoring, but it feels like just a taste of each of these.
The game also suffers from a dominant strategy...whoever kills off their own units in the most productive fashion is usually the winner.
I see Blood Rage as kind of a "Hey, check this out!" sort of game. Cool components, silly premise, fun play, but lacks any interesting replayability. Not a keeper.

Juego de mayorías, con combates. Cada jugador lleva una tribu, que debe ir mejorando. Se juega con un draft de cartas, que pueden ser mejoras de tribu, de barcos, de soldados o de monstruos. También hay cartas de misiones.. y al final de la partida, se puntúa también por unos tracks de características de la tribu.

Es sencillo, pero entretenido. Los que lo entienden dicen que el juego gana bastante con las expansiones. A mí, me parece que el juego básico está bastante bien.

12/30/15: First play. I own Midgard but haven't played in 6+ years, and remember little of the details. This definitely feels like that game though, except with the cool minis and way more card actions (including the monsters).

Two of us were new players and the third had played this 4 times before. It seemed like there were a lot of 'fiddly' rules on when things could happen and how cards could be played, and the punishment for being wrong on a rule could be quite severe. In many games being slightly wrong may mean a one or two point swing, but if you did something wrong here it often meant the difference in winning or losing a battle, and that just seemed like a huge impact.

Overall the production values are great, the battling without dice is a strong backbone mechanic for the game, and the card drafting and powers add a nice touch of variety. Definitely looking forward to playing this again with a firmer grasp on the rules. 

05/22/16: Second play, and this game dramatically improved. I had it at a 7 on the first playthrough, but really should have logged it as a 6. Turns out we had a few rules wrong that first play, and knowing better the game going in plus now playing as designed really worked to increase the enjoyment . Felt way more streamlined, less fiddly player interaction, and again, phenomenal production values. Now Jim just has to get his minis painted!

RATING: 7
Ameritrash Rating.

Definitely better than the original Midgard which this game is based on.
Simple rules. Can get playing quickly. No convoluted combat. Lasts 1h45m. Doesn't over welcome its stay. 

At heart, the game is about drafting cards - getting the best card combo. It's not really about any conflict. Herein lies the problem. Since the card draft IS the game; the chrome, the board, and the "combat" are really rather extraneous. So aren't there better card drafting games?

As an aside, compared to the other AT flavour of the month, Cthulhu Wars, this is far better.

Initial rating after 1 game. Solid men on a map game with amazing minis, elegantly integrated mechanics and slick gameplay. Possible concerns about randomness, the all or nothing combat sytem, the fact that losing battles for rewards feels counter intuitive, kingmaking etc. Looking forward to playing more to form stronger opinion. My gut feel is its a pleasant game but very over hyped.

Once upon a time there was a Kickstarter-campaign to a game called Blood Rage.
The game was really pretty looking with nice miniatures and artwork. But the gameplay wasn't convincing at all. So I let that campaign pass and bought some other games...

...a few months later that game was brought to the stores and people could play and review it.

Man, was I wrong.
This game is a real s***load of fun. I've seen a game of this and instantly fell in love with it.

Components, yeah, we don't have to talk about that.
The only two small complaints are the artwork of the board which somehow looks like it suffers television snow and the small cards. I'm not a big fan of this small format. Especially if you handle them a lot.

The game itself is absolutely awesome with a cool, simple but still very variable gameplay.

I especially like the fact that every strategy can work. Winning battles, loosing battles as well as no fighting at all, every possible strategy can work or fail.

Luckily the game is complete as a retail without the usual CMoN Kickstarter-exclusives (in this game there were just a few).
Another area-control with a twist.

Blood Rage is a beautiful game, the miniatures themselves look fantastic, but some of the other components especially the cards leave something to be desired.

1/4/15 - I've played this as a 2-player game a couple of times now, and I don't think I'll do it again. It really needs the extra players to make the board more interesting and reign in a runaway leader. The game gets lopsided pretty quickly as a 2-player affair. I'll refrain from rating the game until I've played with 3 or 4.

Blood Rage was a revelation. I never appreciated too much CMON games considering them terrible (Zombicide was really annoying). It is a simple control game, but with deep mechanics. Under few units and a very clever draft mechanism is hidden a wargame soul. Mechanics perfectly fitted to the setting.

Issue: Analysis Paralysis (very long drafts), maybe Loki strategy a little bit stronger than others.

This has really grown on me; it's basically Chaos in the Old World finally done right. I find I miss a little bit of a randomness option in the combat, but that's just a preference; for what this is, it works quite well. Also nice that it's pretty short, comparatively. It is also, unfortunately, inordinately expensive; I wish it had been the $50-$60 game it feels like. The minis are super-photogenic though for Instagram.

I'm typically not a fan of dudes on a map type games, but that's only part of this game. Players draft cards with new abilities, goals to achieve, battle cards, etc, and then use them to try to gain an edge on their opponents.

As glory can be attained in many ways, even losing in battle, many different strategies can emerge based on what cards you have. The game also encourages action rather than sitting around and turtling, which is great, as turtling is a big reason that dudes on a map games tend to be lame.

Overall, a strong thematic game with some stuff there if you're usually more a fan of cube pushing as I am.

This is a preliminary rating, as I haven't played it enough. The components are quite good, of course. My first game was pretty good, but we didn't get to finish. The second game we corrected (hopefully) most of the play mistakes we had made. Due to smart play and good luck on one opponent, I got wiped off the map at the end of the first age, and spent the next two ages far enough behind the leaders to make play painfully frustrating at best. The person who placed second actually was ahead on the board scoring, but the leader tied up by the third age, and had about 40 more bonus points than the second place person. Nobody ended on the same side of the track, scoring-wise. 

I do want to play this more, but I have a feeling it reminds me why amaritrash style games are my least favorite (I still like them). This particular game seems fairly high in the luck department - getting a good combo of cards (and of course taking the right actions to exploit them). Our play time with three player was about 2 hours - some players being fairly AP prone - but of course it felt longer stuck with no shot at a rebound. 

I'll have to see with more plays, but I feel like other ameritrash style games either keep you more involved, or at least eliminate you.

I'm admittedly not a fan of "dudes on a map" games, but Blood Rage did have a nice mix of Euro and Ameritrash mechanics. To point out the obvious, the minis are awesome and the game looks great on the table. I also enjoyed the card drafting at the beginning of each age to help formulate an overall strategy and introduce some asymmetry between the clans via upgrades. My biggest complaint is that I felt it was hard to really put those strategies into action with the board being so tight in the second half of the game. I felt like my moves were dictated by other people's actions and I just had to react to them instead of focusing on my strategy. But I;m definitely willing to try it again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Absolutely fantastic.  A tighter yet more wily Chaos in the Old World that runs smoother.  Perhaps the pinnacle of Ameritrash/Euro hybrid.

This would be the perfect game if we had alternate Age decks so the cards/combos didn't get repetitive.  The content discovery aspect of this game is the only thing weighing it down as it feels much quicker to experience and understand than something like Chaos in the Old World.  

Love the game and it's so close to being perfect.

This game was a whole lot of OK, and I am surprised by the massive amount of love it is getting, when I feel I get as good, if not better experience from Kemet and Cyclades. I would enjoy playing this more, and get to know the cards better, so that we could play with the drafting rules, but it seems pointless to do so unless we all had more foreknowledge of what we were looking for.  It's what puts me off games with drafting elements that are present while trying to teach the game.  I don't know what to do to make this work for me with games like these.

Es un juego de mesa muy divertido que combina varias mecánicas que me gustan de otros juegos como por ejemplo: tiene la fase de elección de cartas como del 7 Wonders, tiene control de área parecido a El Grande (entre más unidades tengas en un territorio suele haber mayor ventaja), el combate es parecido a Scythe porque cada participante escoge una carta de combate a la vez y se pueden completar búsquedas más o menos como se hace en Lords of Waterdeep. Hay varias estrategias viables para poder ganar en este juego e incluso uno puede ganar siempre perdiendo en las batallas, además cuenta con unas miniaturas que son de muy buena calidad, las miniaturas siempre hacen un juego de mesa mucho más bonito a la vista.

Based on 1 play with 5 players:

Not exactly in love with this, but not bad either. The combat is a bit on the bland side, but the card combos are sufficiently compelling and they're the real meat of the game. The way pillaging works and the Rage resource management work together nicely to give the game some interesting timing considerations. 

I suppose though, if I'm going to go for sub-2 hour Dudes on a Map game it's hard to imagine choosing this over Nexus Ops. Everything here is so transient and opportunistic; my favorite DoaM games are both opportunistic and have some kind of long-term progression. Here, it's really just your three stats which is a little underwhelming.

Totally happy to play this again, but will not be rushing out to get my own copy.

The cards seemed unbalanced - eg there is a +5 str and a +4 str card with no special powers in round 1. Why would they do that? And the number of screw you cards (lose to steal another players rage etc.) make planning frustrating. 

Running around and fighting is kind of fun, but the bonuses from the cards are where all of the points are scored, and that seems just disconnected from everything. This is not a game I want to keep track of the multiple special actions cards 4 other players have to be able to act accordingly. The getting a boat destroyed card is so easy to fulfill and worth so much for example. Thematically, way too many bonuses for dying for me.

One play so far. The game with five players was slow considering how few actions players can afford. Finding cards that work well together appears to be key. The Valhalla strategy (kill off your own people) seems very powerful with a huge spread of points by the end. Might be more enjoyable once players become familiar with the cards. The miniatures, whilst pretty, don't help you calculate strength quickly and it's difficult to keep track of everyone else's tableau / rule exceptions.

Area control masquerading as dudes on a map! I really liked Chaos in the Old World and I also like this. Sneaking around trying to get secret missions fulfilled for points is fun. The card draft seems like a pretty neat way to get around the knowledge hurdle that CitOW had of players needing to be really familiar with every faction's capabilities and deck to be able to effectively counter them. Instead inexperienced players get to see what their opponents can do before it hits them. (OK, so I guess Midgard came first and had card drafting before CitOW came out. Still a good idea.)

I'd been curious about this game after hearing about it from a friend. A bit of Chaos in the Old World? Drafting? Sounded good to me!

After one play, I definitely like it. Our group decided it is part Chaos in the Old World and part Kemet. I own both of those games, so I'm not sure I need to own this one, but I'd happily play this anytime. 

Draft cards, spend action points to deploy units to the board or upgrade abilities... gain VPs for generating battles or triggering certain special abilities. It's a Euro game in an Ameritrash skin (much like CitOW), it plays slick, and it was a lot of fun.

RATING: 6
I played this more to see what the hype was all about as I really have no interest in this kind of game and I was pleasantly surprised by it. The minis except for maybe the large monsters do nothing for me, but that's not surprising. I'd rather have a hunk of wood with a sticker in my color or even the KS bonus ram heads for everything, than everyone having the same tiny brown pieces because all I look at is the base to figure out who is who. I'll never understand why people throw money at minis, but getting back on point I actually found myself liking this game in spite of my opinion of the lackluster playing pieces. The drafting is neat and the potential card combos are crazy, which really makes the game intriguing to me. My only wish was there was more variability in the cards between rounds as opposed to simply increasing point value for the same card. I guess even that just allows for combos too, but they are not as exciting. Overall the game ran a little long for me, but I can see it being faster with repeated plays and I might actually consider giving it another go, which I would not have thought before playing.

A great game that desperately, desperately needs an FAQ.  Interactions of multiple cards with game rules turns the average experience into a D&D-type rules lawyer debate.  Once clarified, may well become a classic.

Feels like a weak version of Chaos in the Old World. 

Too much of this game appears to be balanced by making a myriad of overpowered cards.

Speed of play is great but the game is right in between light/fun and heavy/challenging, and I guess I don't like that middle ground.

RATING: 7
This is a lovely area control plus special abilities game, a solid design and a great mix of Euro and American style gaming. Unfortunately, it does not compare to its predecessor, CitoW in as much as depth of gameplay and player interaction is concerned. A good game that I'd be happy to play whenever it hits the table.


+ Solid main mechanism and action set, elegant yet functional gameplay
+ Interesting battle mechanism, and due to the battle cards tense and satisfying (although I prefer the dice a la CitoW which give it an epic feeling)
+ Easy to teach
+ Great minis, art and components

= Requires knowledge of the decks to avoid surprises
= Requires people to actively hate draft to stop almost game-breaking combos
= Long with 4 players, but enjoyable so that's fine
= Lacks the brilliant asymmetry of CitoW

- Disliked the (usually unavoidable) "I occupy the whole province and you cannot plunder or invade", too static
- Some upgrade cards, in the German version, had obvious Errata
- The quests seemed repetitive and unimaginative
- Last, one big boo for the Kickstarter exclusives, gameplay is less fun without them, so boo to CMON!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
A heavy area control game with the possibilities to achieve the goal on more than one strategy. Often dying and loosing fights grants more victory points than beeing the winner of the matches. But because you are able to get points on so much different ways, you are free to try other strategies in every play, which is sometimes depending on which strategy the other players focus on.

I love this game. Despite the name, this game isn't a 'roid-rage contest of battle lust and blood. It gives you choices of where to show strength, how to mobilize your clan members to maximize Glory gain, and the outcome you want in battle. All the while you're monitoring your Rage resource and making sure you don't run out too early. It feels very thematic and I would play this at the drop of a hat.

This is a hard one to come up with a good strategy for me.  I've played it twice and had fun both times but haven't come to a good way to play it.

RATING: 9
Fast, furious and fun. Off-the-scale production values with the best board game minis ever produced. But underneath it's actually a great game - it moves fast and there is always something to think about.

The viking theme really comes through with the various incentives to battle - either to defeat your opponents for glory or to lose to your opponents and go to Valhalla for, well, more glory. But even with all the bloody raging around the board it is still a game about strategy and clever point scoring and card play. 

And those minis...did I mention the minis?

This is great competitive fun which allows a variety of strategies within the one game so you all keep guessing at what your opponents are trying to do. Nothing like throwing your fiercest warriors into a battle that you opponent was planning to lose anyway. Have taught a few newbies who have all 'got it' and enjoyed the game. The miniatures are awesome and great to paint. Have the complete KS edition. Extra monsters seem a bit unnecessary, but I love the plastic Clan tokens. This is one of my Top 5 games.

Great drafting game/area control.  Played/learned this game from Sam Healey from Dice Tower!  I love how there are so many different paths to victory.  One could win by sacrificing your warriors every round by sending them to Valhalla...assuming you have the cards that give you those bonuses.  And the miniatures are absolutely beautiful...so much detail.

I've now played about ten bouts of this game. I like it but it's not in my top ten of best games ever. The artwork is pretty and the figures nice. The drafting mechanism is fun and let's you decide whether to pick the best card for you or to prevent your next opponent in line from getting a superb card for him. What I've noticed is that it's typical for this game that one or two players get superb clan upgrade combos and finish the game with say 100% more points than the other players.

This was like a shot of gaming Viagra. My blood was pumping in places I had nearly forgotten about. I was getting bored by the same theme and mechanics presented in typical euro fare. 

Then this comes along and infuses some really cool minis and a  nordic mythology theme and simply rocked my boat.

But Loki how I hate the Loki strategy! My first game saw me maxing out on all the stats thinking I was doing everything just perfectly. And then losing to my youngest brother ,because he was gaining glory killing off his own guys with lots of glorious deaths. 

Well thats how we get to valhalla apperantly and thats how you can win the game.Lesson learned I guess.

Check out Champions of Midgard for more viking fun.

RATING: 9
Best rape and pillage simulator out there. Runs very smoothly and has plenty of strategies to explore. Combat is tense.

The upgrade system is excellent. It really helps with replayability. First couple of plays we somehow missed the rule that after playing a warrior/ship upgrade you get to invade with one of those units for free. From experience I can tell you that this is a great design choice.

I understand complaints about the Rage-stealing Loki card, but this isn't meant to be a pure Euro. You need to keep some gas in the tank and resist the urge to run what seems like the optimal lowest-margin Glory-maximizing razor's edge strategy.

Would be nice to have thicker player boards with indentations for the tokens.

Fun to kill and sacrifice.

It's reckless and has special monsters, which is a saving point.
Lightly themed.

Takes all the good bits of Midgard and loads on theme, chrome, and special powers. Had loads of fun in my one play, though planning around Loki seems (frustratingly?) pivotal.

Excellent game with great components. A lot of interesting strategic decisions to be made.Multiple viable ways to victory beside just winning battles. The game do not botch down the pace by removing the recruitment process that plagued a lot of area control game (lose battle -&gt;recruit -&gt; moving -&gt; lose again to winning player -&gt; repeat (very repetitive to the losing players compared to the lead player)).Only small drawback: rely very heavily on the draft mechanic (most actions will involve cards), so new players will mostly have no chance against veterans, as some cards are straight-up better than others.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fairly light area-control "dudes on a map" game. Rules are simple and straightforward. It's a very pleasant and accessible game. All is built upon drafting mechanic, which determines possible strategies. It works very well and encourages creating powerful combos. Nearly all of them seem overpowered at first, but they're all like that, so game balances itself automatically. There are many ways of gaining victory points - even by losing battles. Personally, I don't like camping in one province, taking all the possible spots(because they are limited) and spamming multiple quest cards. Of course it demands some skill to create such a situation but feels just lame and emotionless. The difference between scoring for won battles and fulfilling the quests is sometimes so big that it's not even worth to fight others.

It is said much about the quality of miniatures and it's not without a reason. They are beautiful and full of details. Of course they bump a price, it's obvious. Sure, it could be played with tokens or meeples. But that's the aspect that grabs so much and I see no problem with that. The rest of the components is okay, pretty standard I'd say. Nothing particularly outstanding. 

So why Blood Rage is such a big success? Probably thanks to it's accessiblity, coherent mechanics that all flow together very well, trendy theme(vikings are quite popular recently, aren't they?) and... lots of plastic put into the box. The game brings nothing new, but it plays so smoothly that it deserves a 8 from me.

Et que fait un viking quand on lui dit qu'il va se prendre 3 météorites géantes dans la tronche avant que son royaume ne soit détruit par le Ragnarök  (la fin du monde ? Non, il ne construit pas un drakkar pour se barrer vers un monde plus sympathique. Il préfère en profiter un maximum et faire une baston générale avec les autres vikings. Celui qui mourra le plus dignement récoltera la gloire éternelle.
Blood Rage est un jeu de conquête et de majorité et d’affrontement avec tout plein de figurines de vikings et autres bestioles divines. En gros, massacrez vos voisins, faites vous massacrer aussi, pour la gloire. Dans la joie et la festivité, évidemment.

Fast pace game which reminds me in some aspects of Triassic Terror. Rules are rather simple. Defeats are not always major set-backs and can even be favorable. I really like the card drafting which is very important in this game. Very well playable with 2 players.

Nice area control/card assisted combat game. Honestly I expected more from the hype around the game, yeah the game is gorgeous and the miniatures are outstanding, but I feel the base game isn't that deep. In fairness I've only played it twice and I've only played it with 2 players so my rating may change. In summary it reminds me of Cyclades but I prefer Cyclades.

Literally a game where the first person to steam roll the other players wins. Thus meaning if in the first age someone gets their army out and the other 1-3 players wipe to Valhalla they control pillaging (and yggdrasill) for the rest of the game uncontested.Loki cards can give you points for losing but it's a massive loss in vp to cost ratio. The minis are gorgeous and the play is smooth but that's about the extent of the props I can give

Overhyped due to the gorgeous minis and great theme, but disappointingly frustrating. The game is chaotic...no matter what you choose to do, it often fails because of another player's actions, even when they did not intend to interfere with yours. So you never know for sure if you will win a battle, and if you do, whether a Loki card will counter it because the other player didn't really want to win. Or if someone will accidentally spoil your plans because they have a similar card. Everything I did felt like a crapshoot. A big disapointment. 

And really...would anyone play this game if it had cubes instead of the miniatures?

This is the game that looked to other previous game`s flaws and better find a way of avoiding them!

There is so much interesting stuff happening around: The worker placement, the card drafting, the upgrade tracks, the declared and secret objectivs (quests), the area control, the combats, etc.
However, all of this is done with great smoothness since the rules don´t give much room for doubts and the game can be over in just 2 hours. The interaction through combats is forced but the outcome of the fights is very easy to calculate.
A game with a taste of civilization (building and developing) envolving combats, that plays fast and with easy rules, that´s a winning formula! 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Pros:
- Card drafting provides some space for interesting combos and point scoring opportunity.
- Understanding movement tempo and careful timing of unit deployment and placement is key.
- Simple and fast simultaneous card play combat resolution.
- Amazing miniature design.

Cons:
- More of a card drafting game than an area control game. Area majority is important though for scoring.
- Not a lot of room for bluffing despite card play.
- Some floppy spears on miniatures.
- 5th player adds a lot of downtime.

Haven't played enough to make up my mind on this highly successful game. Some games go too long, some are nailbiters, and some are blow outs.

Rated after 1 play @ 3 players, 1 play @ 5 players

The game looks a lot more complex that it really is. There are only 5 actions you can take each turn, some costing rage from your pool this round. Combat is done using cards and the highest value wins. You can play cards to give you bonuses each round, provide upgrades to your units or add additional units. With 2 new players, it should only take 15-20 minutes to explain almost all the rules. 

The board constantly gets tighter and peaceful coexistence becomes impossible. The beginning of the game felt very solitare to build up your stats and creatures. When the board becomes tight, it's just a mindless slugfest. In one round, I basically ran full steam into the center of the map and managed to pillage it and eliminate a player's entire clan for that round.

It can be fun with 3-4 players willing to not take the game too seriously and just having fun. The fifth player leads to too much downtime. Players who try to optimize everything also tend to drag down the draft or turns and make the game just a painful event.

2-4

Voorbereiding:

Elke speler kiest een clan en clansheet. Neem de clan’s leider figuur en 8 warrior figuren en plaats ze in de plastic basissen in jouw kleur. Neem je corresponderend schip figuur. Plaats je figuren in je reserve op je clansheet.

Plaats alle monsters naast het bord.

Zet je clan’s glory marker op de 0 van de glory track.

Plaats je clan tokens op de juiste plaats op je clansheet: 6 rage, 3 axes & 4 horns. Plaats je laatste clantoken op de 6e plek van de rage track. 

Plaats de valhalla sheet en de age track sheet naast het speelbord.

Plaats de pillage tokens met de groene rand in de provincie Yggdrasil in het midden van het bord, met de beloning faceup. Schud de andere pillage tokens en plaats ze random faceup op de 8 overblijvende provincies rond Yggdrasil.

Schud de 8 ragnarok tokens en plaats er 1 op elk van de 3 ragnarok plaatsen van de age track, met de tekst faceup.

Plaats het doom token op de provincie die overeenstemt met de provincie die op het ragnarok token van de first age track staat.

Afhankelijk van het aantal spelers, neem x aantal ragnarok tokens en plaats ze met de vernietigde zijde naar boven op de juiste provincies.

5 spelers: geen vernietigde provincies
4 spelers: 1 provincie vernietigd
3 spelers: 2 provincies vernietigd
2 spelers: 3 provincies vernietigd

Een provincie met een ragnarok token is onbestaand. Hierop kunnen geen figuren worden geplaatst.

Sorteer de kaarten op hun rugzijde en maak 3 decks: 1, 2 en 3. 

5 spelers: voeg de 5+ kaarten toe
4 spelers: verwijder geen kaarten
3 spelers: verwijder alle 4+ kaarten
2 spelers: verwijder alle 3+ en 4+ kaarten.

Plaats het saga token op de eerste plek van de first age op de story track.

Geef de startspeler het startspelertoken. Dit token schuift op het einde van elke age door naar de linkse speler.

Elke provincie (gebied) heeft 3 tot 5 dorpen. In elk dorp kan 1 figuur staan. In Yggdrasil kunnen oneindig veel figuren staan.

Er zijn 4 fjorden, telkens tussen twee provincies aan de buitenrand. Elke fjord ondersteunt de 2 provincies die hieraan grenzen. Elk effect dat de provincie beïnvloedt, zal ook de ondersteunende fjord beïnvloeden. In elk fjord kunnen oneindig veel schepen staan.

Speelbeurt:

Het spel duurt 3 ages. Elke age bestaat uit 6 fasen. Verplaats de saga token op de age track. Wanneer de laatste fase van een age is afgelopen, verplaats je de saga token naar de eerste fase van de volgende age tot het spel eindigt aan het einde van de derde age.

1/ God’s gifts:

Geef elke speler 8 kaarten. Elke speler kiest een kaart en geeft de overige kaarten aan de linkse speler. Herhaal dit tot elke speler 6 kaarten heeft. Leg de 2 overgebleven kaarten af.

Spel met 2 spelers: kies steeds 2 kaarten tot elke speler 6 kaarten heeft. Leg de 2 overgebleven kaarten af.

Kaarten van vorige ages worden bewaard op de clansheet.

2/ Acties:

Tijdens je beurt kies je 1 enkele actie. Als je actie rage kost, betaal je de kost door het token op je rage track te verplaatsen. Als je niet voldoende rage hebt om te betalen voor een actie, dan kan je die actie niet meer doen. Als je rage op 0 staat, dan kan je geen enkele actie meer doen (zelfs geen gratis acties).

De actiefase eindigt meteen wanneer alle spelers op 0 rage staan of als alle provincies zijn gepillaged.

A/ Invade:

Kies een figuur uit je reserve en betaal evenveel rage als de STR van de figuur. Plaats de figuur op een leeg dorp in om het even welke buitenprovincie (niet Yggdrasil). Een schip moet in een fjord worden geplaatst.

Invading met je leider kost geen rage!

Als je evenveel figuren op het speelbord hebt staan als het getal op je Horns stat, dan mag je geen figuren meer in het spel brengen.

B/ March:

Betaal 1 rage en kies 1 provincie (geen fjord). Verplaats om het even hoeveel figuren van 1 provincie naar lege dorpen in 1 andere provincie. De provincies hoeven niet aangrenzend te zijn. 

C/ Upgrade:

Je clansheet heeft plaats voor 8 upgrades: 
1 voor elke warrior, leider en schip
2 voor monsters
3 voor je clan

Kies een upgrade kaart uit je hand en betaal evenveel rage als de STR van je kaart. Plaats de kaart op de juiste plek op je clan sheet. Als er geen plaats meer is, leg je de oude kaart af en vervang je ze door de nieuwe kaart.

Troop upgrades: Wanneer je een leider, warrior of schip opwaardeert en je hebt het corresponderende figuur in je reserve, dan mag je deze figuur meteen in het spel brengen (invade) zonder rage te betalen.

Monster upgrades: Wanneer je een monster opwaardeert, neem je het corresponderende figuur en plaats je jouw basiskleur eronder. Daarna mag je het monster figuur meteen in het spel brengen (invade) zonder rage te betalen.

D/ Quest:

Speel een quest kaart facedown op je clan sheet. Dit kost geen rage. Je mag zoveel quests spelen als je wil, zolang je rage niet op 0 staat.

E/ Pillage:

Kies een provincie waar minstens 1 van je figuren instaat (of in een ondersteunende fjord) en die deze rond nog niet succesvol is gepillaged. (pillage token toont de beloning side up). 

Pillage kost geen rage. 

Pillage bestaat uit 3 stappen.

Stap 1: kondig het gevecht aan.

Elke andere speler (van links naar rechts) kan ervoor kiezen om in het gevecht te stappen door 1 of meer van hun figuren van een aangrenzende provincie te verplaatsen naar een leeg dorp van de betreffende provincie. Dit kost geen rage. Schepen kunnen niet verplaatsen. In Yggdrasil kunnen oneindig veel figuren worden geplaatst.

Wanneer er geen vijandelijke figuren in de provincie staan of er zijn geen ondersteunende fjords van andere spelers, dan vindt er geen gevecht plaats. Je neemt de beloning en draait de pillage token naar zijn pillaged zijde. In dit geval verdien je geen glorie door het gevecht te winnen.

Stap 2: speel kaarten.

Elke speler speelt tezelfdertijd 1 kaart uit zijn hand:

Je toont een rode Battle kaart: de +STR bonus wordt toegevoegd aan de totale STR van al je figuren die deelnemen aan het gevecht + alle speciale eigenschappen op de kaart hebben effect.

Je toont een zwarte upgrade of een groene quest kaart: het voegt geen STR toe en het heeft geen effect.

Stap 3: de speler met de meeste STR wint het gevecht.

Bij gelijkspel verliezen alle spelers. 

De winnaar van het gevecht verliest al zijn uitgespeelde kaarten. De verliezer van het gevecht mag al zijn uitgespeelde kaarten terug op handen nemen. 

Alle verliezende spelers moeten al hun figuren in die provincie vernietigen (inclusief de ondersteunende fjords) en verplaatsen naar de Valhalla sheet.

Enkel de speler die de pillage heeft gestart, maakt kans op de beloning van het pillage token (draai het token daarna naar de pillaged zijde). Als de speler die de pillage heeft gestart, verliest, dan blijft de pillage beloning liggen. 

De winnaar van het gevecht wint sowieso glorie gelijk aan hun axes stat, ongeacht of hij de pillage heeft gestart of niet.

3/ De spelers mogen 1 kaart houden voor de volgende age en leggen alle andere handkaarten af. In de derde age moeten alle handkaarten worden afgelegd.

4/ Questfase:

Elke speler draait al zijn quest kaarten om. Als de voorwaarden op je kaart zijn voldaan, dan verdien je glorie (zie questkaart) en mag je 1 van je stats met 1 stap verhogen.

5/ Ragnarok:

Vernietig de verdoemde provincie en vernietig alle figuren in de provincie en de ondersteunende fjords. Deze figuren en fjords gaan naar valhalla. Ontvang het aantal glorie dat op de age track staat voor elke figuur die werd vernietigd. Verplaats het doomtoken naar de volgende verdoemde provincie. 

6/ Bevrijd Valhalla:

Alle figuren van valhalla gaan terug naar de reserves van de betreffende spelers. 

Het einde van een age:

Draai alle pillage tokens terug naar de zijde met de beloning. Geef de startspelertoken door naar de linkse speler. Verplaats het sage token naar de eerste fase van de volgende age.

Het spel eindigt aan het einde van age 3.

Voor elke clan stat dat op de 4e of 5e stap staat, verdien je +10 glorie. Voor elke clan stat dat op de laatste stap staat, verdien je +20 glorie.

De speler met de meeste glorie wint!

Gut reaction is that it's a lighter version of [i]Chaos in the Old World[/i], though it has some of its own twists. The mechanics are straightforward, and the fact that dead units can actually be point generators is an interesting touch. Plus, it's short.

But wow, I think this game seriously overrated. Overall, I found the gameplay somewhat average, with point scoring multipliers in Age 3 playing a huge role in determining the winner, not to mention the overly deterministic combat. But, apparently just adding nice miniatures adds a full point to a games' rating around here. And this is for a game where the miniatures are purely decorative.

Bummed that there hasn't been any other expansions(beyond the initial ones) to shake things up a little. Still an awesome game, and the drafting changes the game from play to play, but overall it can start feel samey as I thought might happen. Drops a few spots, but remains as one of my favorites.

[January 2016 - 9.2]
This game is well worth all the praise it's getting as it hits all the right notes. There's strategy, but the game isn't complicated or difficult to teach. There's minimal downtime as you could be involved in every turn. There's great interaction, but you don't lose the game from losing one or even a couple of battles -- in fact losing battles may be your strategy. And of course, the miniatures and artwork are fantastic.

There's area control, timing, engine building, drafting, battles and bluffing. It reminds me of a mix between Cosmic Encounter and El Grande with hints of Seven Wonders and Hansa Teutonica. 

Drafting is definitely key, and one thing our group has learned is to definitely be aware of what people's strategies are -- especially going into the third round -- and then make sure to take some of the cards they want before they get to them. If you combine a few key cards together from a group, then it can lead to 100+ points in the third round.

There are quite a few over-powerful cards, especially if grouped correctly, so stop opponents via 'hate drafting,' or be sure to build your own powerful group of cards that can match them in points.

That being said, my question with this game is how much legs does it have? There might be the potential to grow tired of the same cards -- as many repeat themselves in rounds 1,2 and 3 (only with different points) -- or does getting to know every card really well just make the game better as you play on?

My guess is that there will many, many expansions that come out to vary the game, although that may start to disrupt some of the balances, especially if one faction (style of play) gets under-represented and another over-represented.

For now, it sits as one of my top-rated games and we'll see how long that lasts.

When my ameritrash loving gaming buddies made me play Blood Rage, I thought: "Oh no, not another Dudes on a Map game!". A few rounds in, I had to revise my first impression. While Blood Rage looks like your typical ameritrash game thanks to all the miniatures and the setting, the gameplay itself surprised both me and my bloodthirsty gaming buddies. In the draft, I made my clan worship Loki and therefore I made a lot of points just losing battles and fulfilling Valhalla quest while the other guys played a more conventional dudes on a map game. My attempt to try something different worked out in the end. While everyone was struggling with the sudden end of a round, which triggers when either all regions have been pillaged or no one has any rage left and reminded me a little bit of Luna, I just made sure I did the two three things I had to do and let my people die in battles afterwards. Surpringsly, this worked and I won by quite a margin.

All in all, in my one and only game of Blood Rage so far, it felt a lot more like a Euro than your typical ameritrash game.

Norse mythology-based Dudes on A Map game with great looking minis. Card drafting -- that balances combat modifiers with unit upgrades and scoring bonuses -- instead of dice brings surprisingly strategic depth to the game, and good design decisions deal with the 'just kill everything' mentality and 'pick off the loser of the previous battle' issues common to most DoaM titles. Possibly the best DOAM game yet. (January 2016)

After all the hype surrounding this much lauded area control/combat fest, I must admit, I was a bit disappointed. I found it really dragged and I was also underwhelmed by the endless combat scenarios to obtain victory points = who cares! The theme seems tacked on and superficial, and the card drafting mechanics are both luck-driven and irritating if your opponent manages to secure the powerful monster cards. Nice minis, though!

Blood Rage is a euro-style area control game where the goal is to have the most victory points at the end of three rounds. There are a ton of different ways to get victory points just like a traditional victory point salad euro game.  The mechanics are nicely balanced and elegant, but they do not make much thematic sense. In these regards, Blood Rage is a very well done euro game.  

But Blood Rage also has the direct conflict of an traditional ameritrash game.  It comes with over produced miniatures of amazing quality that make you want to love the game.  And the game play delivers in spades.  While many of the mechanics don't make any logical sense, the theme comes through emotionally by making you feel like you're in the midst of a chaotic battle.  

I love this game.  It's among my favorite of the past 5 years and definitely the best new game I've played in the past 2 years.  It deserves all of the attention it's been getting recently.

The core of the game is solid and fun - the game is a bit let down by just how swingy, and impossible to account for, battle cards that makes the combat fairly random.

The figures are preposterously large and completely unnecessary - but I guess that's what brings in the KS pledges - however prices it out of my budget at retail.

Very cool game with amazing figures (KS edition here). Reminds me of Chaos in the Old World (which I still think is the better game), but much faster and less complicated. This is more pillage and burn and not so much long time strategy.

I really liked it. Sure there are plenty of broken card combos around but the drafting at the start of each turn should mitigate that somewhat with experienced players. You can always try to gang up on the leader otherwise.

After 1 play...I'm not sure if this is better than Midgard.   It can be very, very swingy.  You get no points for Valhalla if you don't have the right card.  The combat cards are very powerful and introduce a ton of chaos into fighting.  And if you lose a big battle, you are in a world of hurt.  Win it, and you make out like a bandit.   Still I need to give it another chance.  Maybe my rating could improve, but I'm not optimistic it will.

The mini's are cool though.

Players are clans of Vikings, seeking Glory (victory points) as Ragnarok encroaches and destroys the land.  A rather bland and odd blend of Eurogame mechanisms - drafting, area control, action points - dressed up as an Ameritrash game.  The game forces players into conflict with escalating in power card decks, and a playing area that shrinks.  We discovered Sons of Anarchy just before Blood Rage, which felt similar to Blood Rage, but a much stronger design.

Beautiful minis! The game-play is stunningly euro, card drafting, area control. One can get lost in the multiple paths to victory! Do I go up in flames during Ragnarok and achieve glory?

Once you wrap your head around the fact that losing is sometimes winning in this game things really start to sing!

Blood rage is an area control game with a twist, in fact there may be several twists. The game is just as much as about drafting, and strategic card play than it is about having the most men on the board and you can even win by having your pieces killed in battle or in Ragnarok .

Overall I like the game, though I feel I prefer Chaos in the Old World (CiTOW) to this one quite a bit.
 
Firstly some Postives:

Short set up time and relatively quick play time.

This game actually plays well with two - which is a massive plus in my book.

Great minis, perhaps the best I have seen in a board game outside of Games workshop, and with no - or minimal - assembly.  There is no need to paint these minis as the plastic already has a little bit of colour (it's like someone fell into the molten plastic) a pinkish tinge and the monsters are a bluey grey colour. They make the models in CiTOW seem like tiddly-winks.
 
Customisable sides, leads to asymmetric powers, and I feel the game would hold up to repeated plays.

Dynamic play, with the board state constantly fluctuating.

The fact that you can have a death orientated strategy via Loki cards is brilliant. Though this information is apparent to other players as upgrades are placed onto your player mat. 

Neutrals:

Board is functional and nice, but not beautiful (that's probably not the right word) I feel its utility reflects criticisms of CiTOW's board for being busily artful, without enough pragmatic considerations, like can you actually fit the miniatures onto the boardspace?
 
The scores aren't as close as I would like so far, and I have some concerns regarding things being 'overpowered', but I'll take it on trust that that is not the case, and it's more a situation of needing familiarity with the cards, which makes your first game(s) a little opaque. Can you choose cards in fitting with any strategy and play well and win irrespective of which strategy you choose? I don't know.
Compared to the board I feel personally that the miniatures are overproduced, they seem to suggest another game which this one is not....

Cons:

What I mean to say is that the game has this steroidal almost mad viking theme, which is lots of fun, but actually it is a thinky and euroesque game more than a 'war' game- I like this fact - but this degree of separation makes the theme seem a bit disconnected.  And the minis increase the price-point a lot. Wooden tokens would have worked just as well and would have mitigated the feeling that I never feel like I am pillaging anything on the board or 'marching', or that my monster - as cool as it is - is actually more than just a number I bring into 'battle' and then manipulate with my  annoyingly small cards. CiTOW also has annoying small cards - it's worth saying that in both games both are small for equally good reason. However I do feel that whatever happens on the board in that game is more thematic - and just a gamer-y if that is what you want. Hence I'd recommend that one over this.


Addendum: I think this is better with 2 than most people give it credit for. Swingy scores with groups of mixed ability/ knowledge of the cards. The wide spectrum of score might be a strength of the game though.

Ok game with some nice monster miniatures.

But balancing issues, not enough play testing and a desperately needed FAQ turned it into an average experience for me.

It is hard for me to invest in a game that seems even a little like Chaos in the Old World, because I usually just end up wanting to play CotOW instead.  This does look interesting though, with interplay between the card draft, quests, battles, and upgrades.  Even with all that going on, the gameplay looks fast and fun.  I'm still on the fence about the Kickstarter.

RATING: 3
1 demo play, with two rules incorrect (we played that the winner of the battle gets the reward regardless of who initiates the pillage, and without an initial province destroyed) so take it with a grain of salt.

Viewed as a thematic game, it very much limits the range of conflict and drama that can actually occur. Very few pieces in each location, all powers are relatively incremental (with exceptions like the giant that kills everyone at his location.) It's a curious choice for what should be The Ultimate in Theme.

As a strategic game, the card-drafting multiple-path-to-victory doesn't really appeal to me. The connections are fairly obvious (if you get all the points-for-dead-stuff upgrades and the kill-your-own-stuff, you will probably win.) A mix of cards seems a good idea; you don't even have the pleasure of very diverse strategic paths, as would ideally be the case.

I feel it's a hybrid design that takes the worse elements of thematic games (lack of depth, special powers on cards) and strategic (multiple paths to victory, surprisingly low interaction, combo engine pieces).

This game has really impressed me. A tight design with plenty of decision points. Bit that remind me of my favorite game Chaos in the Old World but blended together to make a much easier game.

This has captured elements from so many areas of gaming and actually made something greater than the sum of so many parts.

RATING: 6
It combines action efficiency, engine building, victory point accumulation, and auction-based combat from the Euro sphere with minis, confrontation, and theme from the American sphere. I'd sum it up as an engine building race that incentivizes confrontation. Tension comes from the ambiguous meaning of unit placement, racing for resources, the uncertainty of card play in battle, hidden quests, and the risk of loss in battle. Battles are a three-stage auction with several wrinkles, and actually created some interesting moments. I'd play it again, although I wish the game was half as long.

The production detracts from the enjoyment for me: I'd much rather it cost half as much, have simpler pieces, and employ a theme that wasn't so obviously targeted at men who think that blood and death and monsters and objectified women somehow make a game more immersive.

Oh, this game is so much more than I expected. It turned out it was good choice for [b]Cool Mini or Not[/b] to employ established game designer because [b]Eric Lang[/b] made one great game. And CMON made some amazing miniatures of course. You pick your tribe and everything have the same starting parameters, but then cards are being drafted and your race sheets are being upgraded with unique powers, abilities and allies. And then you pillage Yggdrasil and surrounding lands for blood, glory and Ragnarok. And it plays like that in three rounds. It's fairly quick epic game, leaning slightly, but really slightly toward thematic Euro, which I love.

RATING: 7.5
As Chaos in the Old World is one of my favoritest games, I was happy to learn that Lang decided to revisit it on his way to designing Blood Rage.  I was less than thrilled to learn that he was working with CMON, but it worked out pretty well (and admittedly, the minis are cool).

Like CitOW, Blood Rage is an area-control game with a little asymmetry thrown into the mix that is, unlike CitOW, somewhat customizable.  While each faction has a starting base power, you can tailor your faction to your liking so long as you can afford to get the upgrades you want.  This ensures that despite the game starting the same each time you play, there's a good chance that as it goes on, you'll find something different at least through several playthroughs before it gets old.

One of the neat ideas that gets explored here is purposely sacrificing your units to get bonuses.  At first, I thought this might be crippling, but it isn't.  It's pretty easy to get your guys back on the board so it's all the more fun to throw them into certain death just to squeeze some more points out of the deal.

Another thing that distinguishes it from its grandpappy is the card drafting.  Where in CitOW, each player has their own specialized deck to work with, in Blood Rage, everyone shares the card pool and must draft what they want to have for the round.  One of our players coined a nice phrase called, "hate drafting," which turned out to be quite the effective strategy.

On the downside, it seems the three tracks with a potential 60-point swing seems a bit overpowered.  Yes, you can fight against it, but clever play will inevitably end up with someone getting maxed out on the three tracks and if you haven't been paying attention to them, you have no hope of winning.  The other thing I felt lacking was that despite the minis being absolutely beautiful, they drive the price of the game to a ridiculous amount and YMMV, really.

Is BR better than CitOW?  No.  I find that CitOW is a finely-balanced asymmetric game, perhaps the main reason I find it to be one of my favoritesty games.  But that doesn't mean that BR is a slouch - far from it, there is merit to owning both.  While they share similar ideas, they feel distinct from one another, and we even tested that by playing them very closely to one another.

If I may use an analogy, CitOW is a finely-tuned, balanced and powerful GTI where Blood Rage is the little Fiesta ST that is rough around the edges, but still a lot of fun to drive.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
It definitely took me several plays to appreciate Blood Rage. It's NOT simply an area control game - winning battles is NOT the goal. It is a Glory point accumulation game, with multiple and diverse strategies to do so. 

My biggest complaint is that it becomes difficult to track the other players' upgrades and abilities as they accumulate. Perhaps I just need more familiarity with the game.

After my first play through (2 players) I honestly wasn't that impressed, but after my second game (also 2 players) my eyes have opened to the ridiculous potential for strategy, bluffing, memory, combos and baiting ( I'm a master baiter, hyuk hyuk).

RATING: 8
Brilliant.   The game is fairly easy to teach, and the theme and mechanics are mashed together exquisitely. You constantly have to watch what others are doing, weaving your clan onto and around the board in order to find the best scoring opportunities that line up with the cards you drafted.  It's a big sweaty muscle dance.  

I feel like it's a game that you have to play a lot to really start reaping the joy out of it.   The more you and those you play the game with know the cards, the craftier you'll have to get.  It can be kind of tough on new players, because they don't know the cards.  Some of those monster powers can be perceived as jerky if you don't know it's out there.

The one thing I don't like about the game is that winning can feel kind of dirty.  The game revolves around a secret hand of cards that you use to manipulate and mess with everyone else.  Many times, I've felt that the best player in Blood Rage best exploited poor decisions made by the other players, and while that's the case in most games, in Blood Rage it kind of feels mean due to how cards function.  

You can undo a players whole round by throwing down a monster that destroys everything they've built up.  You can lock up a territory (which experienced players probably wouldn't let happen) and exploit it for quest points and stat bonuses, and watch while everyone else decimates each other, and then roll out with a clean up crew - it comes back to everyone needing to have a play or two under their belt (which, admittedly, is not a lot for a decent strategy board game) to level the playing field.  

Unfortunately, I just don't have the mix of players to play this game enough, and for some reason I have a tough time asking someone to play a game called Blood Rage.   My fault.  Not the game.

Despite only giving it an 8, I think it's one of the better, and more engaging games I've played in a long time.

Only two games in and starting to get a clear picture of how it plays. This game is way better than I expected. It goes great with my group that usually likes mostly euro games. I like the fact that you can't focus an attack to any specific enemy. It makes it less confrontational than other dudes-on-a-map games I have played. Super heavy on the strategy and you really need to think how to take all benefit from every turn. Feels like the strategy goes deep and I'm looking forward to getting way more in depth with this one. 

Will rate again after 10-20 games.

A great-looking game that plays like a charm. Simple rules but with many paths to victory through different strategies.

Blood Rage looks like an ameritrash game... it has 'amazeball miniatures,' a viking theme, and looks like a dudes on a map game. Upon closer inspection, it is really more of Euro game or at least a hybrid (ie Kemet). For example, you're trying to get the most Glory/VP to win the game through an action point system. Unlike most action point games, you won't necessarily use all of your action points before the end of the round and there are ways to upgrade the number of action points you receive at the beginning of the round. I like that all of the factions start symmetrical and differentiate as the game goes on through a wonderful drafting mechanism. It's also great that it's hard to pick on someone... when you start a combat, everyone in the region participates. This game plays quickly, is easy to teach, offers interesting decisions, and looks good as well. Definitely worth checking out, even if the theme/chrome turns you off.

I don't like a sea of grey unpainted miniatures, so I use standees for monsters and meeples for player units:

Blood Rage addresses essentially every complaint I have with combat heavy games (peaceful observer strategies, swingy dice combat resolution, player elimination, bash the leader, etc), and it does so without opening other holes for players to exploit. Each decision is multifaceted and gives players enough to chew on to stay engaged and focused, but without slowing the game. The constant cage match-style battling leads to some very memorable moments, and the game has an epic air from start to finish. The fluidity of the board-state, and various victory paths facilitate flexible play from round to round, which is quite unique considering the genre, but I still have concerns regarding long-term replayability.

A great, fast strategy game with a strong theme.
Eric M. Lang did a very good job designing a cool mix of card-drafting and area control with several tricks.
Adrian Smith's illustrations are gorgeous as always, but sadly the general layout doesn't support them in the way it should.
The miniatures are fantastic and the general production quality is brilliant.

It's a lot of fun, and it's fluid and fast-moving. The card draft is kinda weird in that it seems to incentivise personal strategy rather than conflict. Which causes some strategies to be better than others. This is even more true if someone feeds into a loki strategy. Speaking of which everyone needs to be engaged in the game or it takes way too long. But it's still very fun, tightly tuned with many paths to victory without bashing the leader.

I love how the mechanics work in this game. The whole thing is seemless. The game is quick and fun. The miniatures are great, but I do have issues with the card stock of the playerboards for a game that was voted by many reviewers etc as best produced game in 2015.

I have played countless 2 player games and they are usually well decided, which is removed somewhat at higher player counts. 

The true beauty of the game is the draft- because you want all of the cards. Everything has a use to you and the opponent, and you have to ask what you are willing to sacrifice, and pay attention to what your opponents are doing.

Faster and cleaner than Chaos in the Old World, but also with a markedly different feel. Here there's much more of an emphasis on timing and ordering of actions (given that combat/pillaging can be called at any time, rather than just at the end of the round). Of course, the draft is a huge component of Blood Rage as well, whereas selecting upgrade cards in CitOW was quite rote. As for drawbacks:  the third (final) round of Blood Rage is one of massive scoring potential, greatly overshadowing the prior two, unlike CitOW in which every round mattered. Also, the necessity of keeping other players in check is much reduced; here you're out for yourself, first and foremost.

RATING: 6.5
Fascinating game and awesome components. The game is quite straight-forward. This seemed to be a game way off my "comfort zone", but it turned out to be good.
What I dislike about the game, is the power of some of the monsters (if a player get a monster card dealt, the other players can be hardly "hurt" by this monster during the round, without knowing it will come into play), and some of the battle cards (at least the one that eliminate the cards played).
Except for those two aspects, I really enjoy it.

EDIT: I had not a very good experience the third time I played it. I now see the disadvantages of some of the battle cards, which could be very destroying and frustrating. A player can build up to a really great battle, putting all efforts in, and then be destroyed by one mean battle card. Next time I play it, I will take the most destroying cards out of the game, and see how that affects the game play and strategies.

RATING: 5
I really wanted to like this one, but its alright... just plain old alright, bit boring, very mediocre, really not worth the hype it has been getting.

The main meat  of the game is the card draft however there are far too few cards to give any variability really as all but 2 cards are in each draft pool. There is also no way to stop a combo of cards once it is in play, this can lead to a win more situation. 

I would much prefer to play seasons for the card draft as there is SO much more variability in the card powers and they ways they interact not only with your board but with what cards everyone else had drafted. This card interaction in blood rage is severely lacking, card-combos usually consist of only two cards.  Age 2 and 3 cards are also significantly better than age 1 cards.

The area control/ board movement aspect feels a little tacked on and the theme really does not show through. In champions of midgard it feels like I am vikings going on epic quests, or defending my village. In blood rage they really could have been anything milling round the board picking fights.  Also thematically why would the frost giants ever be on your side? 

The minis are receiving of a lot of praise but honestly they could have been tokens, and the sculpts are nice, but they are pretty much industry standard,or at least CMON standard, nothing special nothing raising the bar. 

I can see the comparisons between this and chaos in the old world and IMO Chaos is significantly the better game as a lot of the mechanics from chaos have been streamlined to the point of near obsoleteness in Blood rage

Para mi uno de sus puntos fuertes es la limitación en su duración al jugar sólo durante 3 eras. Pero sin duda lo que mejor me pareció es la interacción que hay durante toda la partida. En ese sentido el juego está muy bien diseñado, incluso con esa especie de ronda de llamada a las tropas de provincias adyacentes para pelear, que puede parecer un poco "tramposa" al verla pro primera vez, pero luego funciona muy bien.

Tried to give this game a chance multiple times but I just can't see why it is so high in the rankings. Every time we play there is a runaway leader problem. 

If you do well in the first round, you will have better stats than the other players and more units left on the map. Which will almost ensure you will also have a good second round and so on.

I also think it is pretty strange that each area has a maximum number of units it can hold. This means you can swarm the map with cheap units and no one will be able to attack you. 

The mission cards are very lack-luster. Almost all of them just require you to control an area of a certain color at the end of the turn. A little variation with different missions would have been nice. It is too easy to see when someone is going for a mission.

The miniatures of course are great and the abilities on the cards are all pretty awesome, but with all the problems mentioned above I just can't enjoy this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Pretty easy game to learn and very intuitive once you play a round in the game. Card drafting might be the most challenging aspect of the game since you do not know all the cards in the game when you first play and the power creep of cards in the later rounds. There are complaints of overpowered card combinations but in card drafting games, this is always a possibility. Multiple ways of winning the game and the Viking theme and mythology is integrated into the game very well. Very good mix of area control, combat, and card drafting. The different faction in the game all start out the same and differentiate with card drafting and stat gaining from successful pillaging. Very cool miniatures and artwork in the game and highly enjoyed playing the game.

Amazing! Deeply strategic and tense. I love how in each game a completely different strategy might call to you: read the signs, go with the flow, and you might end up with a killer combo... or find your plans ruined by someone else. Victory is never guaranteed and you always have to deal with uncertainty. Luck might be on your side or not, but I think it will rarely feel unfair: you will lose mainly to your rivals' maneuvers, not so much to bad luck.

And the theme! Aside from the overly sexualized female warriors of the Serpent Clan, Blood Rage really shines with its enthralling world and ambience. The minis are awesome, with details that surpass FFG quality. Try playing while listening to symphonic or death metal (people would likely believe you if you said Therion's "Secret of the Runes" album was the game's official soundtrack ;)).

Good Game - But definitely overhyped.

The game is VERY swingy, even for veterans, which makes it quite unpredictable what is going to happen in the mid and end game. A lot of secret information (who got which cards?) along with the design for a lot of confrontation with several players at once lead to a certain lack of control for the players and a randomness of who is eventually going to win - No matter how skilled the players are. 

Also, it does not feel like you fight other players in a wiking battle. Instead, it feels more like you acommodate against a current situation on the board.

Verdict after six plays with four players: Great game, outstanding art and production values - but surely not the best game of 2015.

Talán egy egyszerűsített, vikingesített chaos in the old worldnek mondanám, némi draftolással megbolondítva.

Vannak azért hátrányok is: kicsit kevés féle kártya van, túl sok az ismétlődés. Három party után úgy érzem, hogy nem igazán éri meg győzelemért harcolni, mindig hatékonyabb az véráldozat, ami azért nem teljesen tematikus nekem.

Typical Lang design. Flashy and flamboyant combos, leaving it up to the players to bash on the leader in order to keep things in check. Board state is very swingy with units dying left and right so there's no sense of buildup on the map.

RATING: 6
An area majority game with decidedly Ameritrashy looks and a Euro character. The heart of the game is the card draft at the beginning of each age which sets the overall direction of what you are going to try to achieve this turn and how you might go about it. Depending on how that turns out losing battles can be just as helpful as winning them, and scoring opportunities abound, with the later rounds dwarfing the early slim pickings. Card knowledge is quite important throughout as many of the cards are almost ridiculously powerful and can easily smash a carefully groomed plan to tiny pieces.

Blutrausch. Frakturschrift. Das martialische Cover mit dem Wikinger, der aus blutroten Himmel auf uns zustürmt. Monster aus dem Höllenschlund. Miniaturen. Rasende Wut. Das ganze Auftreten schreit Ameritrash in seinem Urgebrüll. Doch was so barbarisch erscheint ist nur die krachende Verpackung für ein verkapptes Eurogame mit Entwicklungsleisten. Okay, da gibt es das Kampf- und Streitelement mit Walhalla, Ragnarök und nordmythologischer Heldenehre, aber im Grunde ist BLOOD RAGE ein Majority Game klassischer Spielart, angetrieben durch Card Drafting jeweils zu Beginn der drei Spielrunden mit immer kleiner werdender Spielfläche. BLOOD RAGE ist nicht einmal besonders schwer, spätestens in Runde 2 nimmt das Spiel Konturen an. Und als Mehrheitenspiel ist BLOOD RAGE sogar recht fluffig: kein Brainburner wie mancher Euro-Kollege, wenngleich man seine Rundenidee schon planen und durchdenken sollte. Der grösste Verdienst scheint mir, dass es BLOOD RAGE als Formal-Hybrid gelingt die Schubladen von Eurogamer und Ameritrasher gleichermassen zu sprengen. Insofern hat dann doch der Hammer des Thor zugeschlagen.

The more I get into gaming, the more wary I get of games that get a lot of hype. This one has lived up to its hype for me and my group. Has that perfect weight that appeals to most of my gaming circle. Strategic enough for the heavy gamers, light enough for the casual gamers. In and out in about an hour or so. So much fun!! I tend to be more of a euro gamer myself, but this didnt feel so competitive that it would be off putting. It was all just in good fun. Easy to roll play it up if you wanted to. One of the few games I have picked up lately where I played back to back. I might of been late to the party on this one, but so glad I bit the bullet and picked it up finally. 100% worth it.

Highly tactical game that requires constant thinking and adjusting of strategy to both improve upon your faction's specialization and block your opponents from further combo-ing on their focus. Every decision is streamlined and meaningful. Mistakes are punished and good play is rewarded, so a fresh player vs a seasoned player may have a huge disparity in scores, which is not ideal, but I don't know how it could be avoided. It's a fast paced, excellent game.

RATING: 8
Finally another game in the "Chaos in the Old World" camp from Eric Lang that does area control, card drafting, and battles in such a nice way.  First off, my favourite part of gameplay is the ability to take a "losing" strategy where the glory of entering Valhalla upon death could be worth big points given certain card combos.  It feels like a very fresh alternative to some other battle games.  The card drafting doesn't so much dictate your turn but gives you options for how you may want to play out your turn and what you want to focus on.  Balancing these cards is important as well as plans may change as you react to other player actions.  CitOW was all about getting a set faction and exploring its possibilities.  Blood Rage allows you to customize your faction through card play, which is excellent.  The different Monsters you can call on are also supremely awesome- not just their miniatures (which are some of the best) but the way they bring up some amped-up power to the game is really cool.  Blood Rage was a little much at times for my poor, puny Euro brain to handle.  There really is no "catch-up" mechanisms.  This means that players must watch each other and prevent each other from pursuing their primary goals too much.  This means some hate-drafting or counter-drafting needs to take place if only to prevent someone else from taking it.  But I don't consider this a fault of the game- it merely sets the tone for a style of game that can definitely be frustrating and painful to those who can't stand to be crushed before their enemies, lamentations, etc. Fans of area control, American-style battle games, and card drafting really should check this one out! It can be punishing and very opaque to new players, but it is a clean, very fluid design.

The game is amazing, great theme and plays well over the 3 ages. Awesome monster components, great card play with lots of diverse options. Winning and losing battles are both viable strategies so you don't feel terrible if you lose battles.

There were some rules that could be clarified better but I think that can be fixed once you play it more and an FAQ comes out.

I can see this one going up to a 9 or 10 because it's a thematic combat game that doesn't drag out and has diverse strategies and tactical play.

What a fantastic gaming experience. A rewarding mix of luck , strategy, bluffing, & battling. The cards can be helpful if played intelligently, and sizing up your opponents is key. The theme comes through so strongly and the components are simply top-notch. The map board could use a bit of lightening, but still quite nice. Game turns move quickly and each phase is over before you know it- almost too rapidly, sometimes. I hate that the box is so large- getting annoyed with large boxed games.

Slightly over-hyped IMO - but a good game.  Really enjoy what the card draft adds to combat.  The theme really works well.  The game has a really good length and a nice weight to gameplay.

I have only ever played with a full table and I am not sure I would want to play with any less.

EDIT: The more I play it the more I like it.  However, my instinct was correct that it suffers at lower play counts.

Also, there is a huge advantage if one player knows the cards better than anyone else or a huge disadvantage if one player simply knows the cards the least.

This would be a really great game for a game group to pick up and then always and only play together as the meta-game would be the most interesting that way.

It's also a completely different game with KS exclusives, much more random.  I think I like it without the exclusives better though...

The gameplay is decent, nothing spectacular or genre-defining. But I was so annoyed by the over-indulgence in miniatures for no gameplay purpose. Don't get me wrong; they look fantastic. But I'd rather they spent more time on improving the gameplay.

Somewhat preliminary rating after 3 plays.

There are a number of moving parts with the area control, special card powers, quests, and drafting. Not sure it's a satisfying game though as there isn't a ton of variety in the cards, and engine-building seems to take a back seat to tactical play. 

As for the production, the minis are definitely nice. Not a fan of the player boards, or some of the artwork. As a card game, you'd have to sleeve the cards to keep them from getting worn quickly. I can't see buying a game this expensive based on the overall game play, but there seems to be a market for this sort of hyped, thematic kickstarter game.

Paying a high price for miniatures, not for a great replayable game. Kickstarter justification in overdrive on this one.  (I also think Vikings are the new Zombies as far as KS game themes go. Many will uncritically buy this theme without question.)

Winners seem to be known with one hour plus left to play pretty much.  Deterministic combat, runaway leaders. and dry mechanisms, lead this to be more lackluster and lengthy than fun.

I thought this game would convert me to AT.   Unfortunately it did not.

Cards are imbalanced.   The leaders should be 2 not 3 so they are also overpowered.   I also don't enjoy the chaotic nature of the game.   Strategies are based on how many people feel like fighting you in that moment and you have little or no control over what can happen.   I guess that is the heart of AT, but I find that to be too chaotic  and a dull experience.

Mini's and components, except the small cards,  are really nice though.

Is this game a spiritual successor to Chaos in the Old World or Midgard? It has a different feel from both. In CitOW, your race determines your strategy, whereas in BR you have to adapt a bit, depending on what cards come your way. Also, there are no dice. I also like the bluff element with the Loki cards. The minis are highly detailed and the monsters are crazy good. Happy that some of the KS exclusives actually add to the game and are not useless. As for Midgard, well, it was more of a straight-forward area control game with card drafting. It's a fun game, but it certainly lacks the theme that Blood Rage has. I see no reason to own Midgard, but I can see owning BR and CitOW.

I don't know if I like this more or less than kemet. Inis is way different than this - more of a puzzle while this is more traditional area control with a cool tech tree. This feels a lot faster than kemet, but I've only played with experienced players so hard to say. If it consistently is, this would probably edge it out.

edit: does not feel faster than Kemet. I think I like these the same and really don't see how these distinguish themselves on the table. Would play either one when looking for a quick, straightforward feeling of getting armies to fight on the table and having cool upgrades to do interesting things. 

I would say I think the rules load/chance to win for first time players is probably better in Kemet.

Opinion: this is not my cup of tea, lot of chaos on the board. You can win doing almost anything. Draft the cards, being almost all of them weird, position your warriors-monsters-leader-boat on the board, spoil what you want and take advantage of the cards you got. Strategy to follow... spoil where you can get VP, not matter the bonus, and focus on the "technology" of your clan (60VPs are worth too much).
I do not like to make many comparisons, but this is a kind of Chaos in the Old World, without the fun

Dropped the rating from 8.9 to 8.4 upon second play. Still a fantastic game and there is no doubt that the best player wins this game nearly every time. But what cards come out in each age, especially in a game with less than four players, really matters. When bonus cards/actions can swing the score 50 or more points in a few seconds, that's a bit more swingy than I would like. I prefer something a bit more methodical. Still, a great game that I will play at every chance.

What a big surprise! From the theme, artstyle and components the game looks like a more "american" style game with lots of fighting but when you get to fighting the mechanics are a lot closer to "european" games.

Great use of the nordic mythology, it's clear that their priorities are much different because dying isn't necessarily a big punishment like in most games. Sometimes that's exactly what you want to do.

Plus, these are the best looking and most detailed miniatures I've ever seen! Every 10 minutes someone walked past our table and said "WHOA!"

Was a lot better when played with correct rules. On the other hand, combat has some of the "I don't even get to play" problem common to blind-bid games; I probably favor using Loki cards to profit from losing battles a little too much just because otherwise I hate losing.

And spending a bunch of rage on a monster that doesn't really pan out is disappointing in the same way.

On the other hand, it's basically a Michael Schacht game, updated with modern gaming contrivances and ridiculous miniatures.

This game has a lot going for it.  Cool miniatures, lots of fighting and conflict and a lot of different ways to go about winning.  It's rare to see a run away leader but sometimes you do get a player left behind a little bit, although mostly you do have a chance to make up a lot of territory in the 3rd age of the game.  From the same makers as Chaos in the old World, and you can see the similarities in the way figures are placed on the board and actions are limited.  Personally I think Chaos in the Old World is superior, but I think Blood Rage is a bit simply and has more mass appeal.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
A really fun game with a great theme and some amazing figures.  The difficulty and tension ramps up nicely throughout the game and it's possible for players to make late come-backs and win from a long way behind.

The main drawback is the drafting system.  This gives a big advantage to experienced players of the game, who will know good combinations of cards and what to look out for.  Also the cards are unbalanced, with some being much more powerful than others, and each of the 3 ages in the game can be made much easier if you get the right cards.  The last age in particular has one card that helps gain a huge amount of victory points for very little effort and the winner of the last 4 games I've played used this card.

With a bit better balancing of the cards this would be an even higher rated game.

Very good area-control game with a cool theme and great components.  I prefer it at the 3-4 player count, as even with the reduced regions, 2-players can feel a bit too "spacious", resulting in some boring early game.  

I do feel the Loki cards, if hoarded by one player to the point of critical mass, can seem a little too strong.  During the drafting, this should be considered. It can be painful to let a good pick pass in favor of denying an opponent yet another card for their strategy.  Just keep in mind that "winning the game" is part of your strategy, and not letting the opponent win is still in alignment with your master plan. 

...that's what I tell people who complain when I hoard the Loki cards.

RATING: 9
Incredibly smooth despite lots of elements to the game. The drafting is engaging, the pacing builds to tense moments the choices seem significant. Overall gives a very unique and good feeling wile playing. My concern is that I was the runaway leader and pretty much dominated as round 2 was midway through. I think i was just more plugged into the game and grasped it more but I could see how a player could jump out and stay ahead with the clan tracks rising early...allowing for more guys on the board, more glory per battle and more rage to spend...rich get richer

An interesting evolution of "Midgard", keeping the card draft and some of the area majority scoring, but much more focused on combat. I sometimes wish "Blood Rage" was more similar to its predecessor, just with far superior components and artwork, but this is just because I'm more of a Euro gamer. It is more like a Euro-Ameritrash hybrid, but it does well what it intends to do and may please fans of both genres.

The draft that starts each of the three rounds is full of agonizing decisions, as most cards feel overpowered (in a good way) and you don't want to give them to your opponents. Then you play upgrades and deploy troops or monsters that will eventually have to fight to pillage regions. The diceless combat is quick and simple, which is a good thing.

Interestingly, I found a bit of similarity to "Cthulhu Wars" in the way that you spend rage to perform actions and how your clan gains different skills as the game progresses. But "Blood Rage" doesn't have big swings of power and doesn't rely on ganging up on the leader to keep the game balanced. In fact, the dynamics of the game make it very hard to gang up on any one player.

The only real flaw is that the central region, Yggdrasil, may be too important. It increases all your three stats if you successfully pillage it, while other regions increase only one. And since troops that lose a battle are destroyed, it's not uncommon for a player to hold it for the entire game (and most often win).

The miniatures are fantastic, even though I would have preferred the vikings to be in the player colors, instead of identified only by a colored band put around the base. This should have been a solution just for the monsters. Nonetheless, the miniatures really enrich the experience and I probably would rate the game lower if it didn't have them.

It's a lot of fun, and it's fluid and fast-moving. I have concerns about the cards, though. In principle, yes, drafting should take care of concerns about card balance--but I'm not sure there's much room for hate-drafting in this game. In a game like Fairy Tale, where you will only play 60% of your cards, you could easily hate-draft. But in Blood Rage, you can easily play all of your cards each era, which encourages everyone just maximizing your own strategy's score. If that's true, then I worry that some strategies are vastly superior to others--compare the points for dead dudes vs. ship upgrades, for example.
But it's still very fun and it seems to win friends wherever it goes.
[EDIT] Further evidence seems to be allaying my fears. This sucker appears to have legs.

Even with all the hype, I was still surprised by how tough the drafting choices are. So many good ones to choose from! Any concerns I had over replayability were all but vanquished after first play.

Very easy to teach and learn. Just plain fun!!

Differing tactics, card draws, combat but being able to win through deception and good planning. It's to me basically a quicker and easier to get to the table version of Game of Thrones.

Love the simplicity of the actions and how the game play flows. Very little down time. I really enjoy that there are so many ways to be rewarded for dying. It gives you benefits for staying alive or sacrificing characters which adds so much to the game. Really enjoy this one and love that it's not bogged down with over complicated rules and systems.

RATING: 6
This game fell in my estimation after a few plays. Its strategies, while seemingly complex and divergent at first blush, are obvious, its minis underutilized, its board relatively uninteresting, and it has a tendency to feature a runaway leader. In this case, that leader was me. I don't speak from the perspective of sour grapes.

While it is, moment to moment, good fun and theoretically expansive enough, it's ultimately an area control game that has its priorities misaligned and waylaid by cardplay. Those first ten minutes of drafting basically supercede the entire area control aspect. Kemet and Siege of Columbia did a better job of balancing power/engine acquisition and "dudes on a map."

I used to hate drafting. I've since made peace with it and accept it as seasoning (ex: Steampunk Rally), but not as the main course. I'll play this, but there are better options.

Joc de control d'arees. No és asímetric al inici, té un card drafting al principi de cada ronda que diferencia els jugadors. Té mecàniques similars al Caos en el Viejo Mundo (l'autor és el mateix) però sense daus. Premia el combat, però pot arribar a interesar fer atacs suicides (premia al derrotat!!!). Rapid i amb moltíssima interacció i rejugabilitat. El drafting és molt interessant.

RATING: 7
Sure this is a straight euro that disguises as an ameritrash game but its chrome & awesome theme is pretty convincing.
Basically an area control game, with many ways to individualize your struggle for most VP. You can go for brute force, specialisation, numerical superiority, sneaky tactics, or a mix of it.
The game is very tactical because the board is ever changing, so thinking on your feet is more important than any long term strategy.

I wouldn't play this with five again, as it was way too long for my taste. But with three or maybe four this could easily replace games like Kemet or to a certain degree Dogs of War.

Quick, shiny, viking romp.

Update: Yeah 4 is much better than 5! (as usual)

Sadly the kickstarter had many cool things i would kinda miss in the normal version.

I know many people love this game but it really fell short for me. The interesting options just weren't there. The cards were limited and the drafting was just OK. There indeed is a runaway leader problem and strategy options can feel weak. I guess playing this a lot with the same people could fix most of theese problems because people will start drafting in order to prevent some of the overpowered strategies (i.e. Loki cards) but this is not the kind of game that appeals to me. It's not a bad game but it's not one that I or my group really enjoyed.

The best implementation and combination of a couple aspects/mechanisms: area control, power card battles, deck building/upgrading, thick theme and victory point hunt.

The card drafting is well implemented, giving asymmetric powers to every player and every game feels different.  High quality miniatures.

It's like Sushi Go! but with more trolls. The game is so much in the draft, and has a steep learning curve. So much information is hidden, a new really doesn't stand a chance unless they are told what combos work. There is no room in Valhalla for those who Loki strat. That being said, it is a great game once you have a experienced group. Getting there after lapping the new players on the scoring track is the hard part.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
I feel the game is very good, but not the most spectacular game ever in comparison to its hype. The miniatures for the game are everything, which Blood Rage has amazing ones, but the rest of the components leave a little to be desired. Small cards, and decent, but fairly thin player boards, but they get the job done.  The design on the board is functional, but a little drab for my tastes, still it looks good, and definitely better than anything I could design. 

I'm not to keen on CMON's business model. Every big game they publish is kick-started almost always being over-funded. I feel the people who don't fund get skimped on features, such as the inclusion of a 5th player etc. They did this with Xenoshyft as well. But Blood Rage I think doesn't suffer too badly, because almost all of the content can be purchased nowadays outside the KS, unlike Xenoshyft(legendary items and Heroes) and Zombicide Black Plague(literally everything it seems). I personally hate KS exclusives. I understand having a few select things, like metal coins/components, thicker boards or wooden bits instead of cardboard, but taking out mini's or semi-expansion content should solely be a timed exclusive that becomes available later. Meanwhile I need to fork out $100+ just for the Fenrir model and card. 

Look I don't hate CMON by any means. The bring out some amazing  games and have designers who are very talented, but I feel the hype from this game, because of the miniatures, blows itself out of proportion a bit. Not to say I hate the game, because it is in my collection and is great. It's a solid 8-8.5, which is very good in my book, and I think it's a great "next step" game for those that are looking for their first miniatures/area control/dudes on a map fix.

Sadly I can't say the same for the expansions, since they leave a lot to be desired. The "expansions" are basically slight modulations to the core rules, which barely put a dent into the game, as far as new mechanics are concerned. But because of this, it's not a bad idea to include them in someone's first play of it, Blood Rage is due for a nice big expansion that adds more to the game. Maybe new monsters to recruit, a new map, artifacts or sacred weapons players can get that alter their armies, or variable player powers.

While the engine and system of an unequal number of actions work well in [i]Terra mystica[/i], the rage system and luck-based draftable cards here make it a bit too swingy and fiddly for what it is. The inability to attack again after pillaging doesn't compute, and there's some fridge horror from the "pillaging".

This is great game from Eric Lang that easily ranks in my personal Top 20.  There are nice elements of card drafting, well timed plays, combat, vp scoring, engine building, and area control.  The game is rich in theme and builds throughout with out losing players along the way as long as you play reasonably well.  The game does favor experience.  The only two small issues I have are with the expansion elements the mystics and Loki can both be problems when the players are of disjointed skill levels as the two elements can be more easily manipulated by experienced players to exploit situations that seem to stray from the core game.

I love this game.  There are multiple routes to getting the VP needed to win, rewarding different strategies; the card drafting means that your strategy isn't scuppered by bad luck, so it's almost entirely skill-based; the fact that rewards escalate through the three ages of the game means that you're never left without a chance of winning, even if you do badly early on.  And and minis are probably the best quality I've seen in a board game.  Brilliant!

Played at a friend's house. Blood Rage - appropriate to the theme - forces a lot of rage, mostly due the result of near-constant combat. There is no true turtling here, and the rather limited number of components makes decisions necessarily precise and meaningful. Cards which can make or break battles are obtained through a drafting system, though the entropy this and the card uses add to the battles are a bit much for my taste in an hour-long game.

I don't like drafting very much in anything except for Magic, though there are exceptions. This isn't one. The utter chaos and unpredictability going into any given combat stinks.

I was surprised. I usually find these games harder to get into and enjoy than many other types of game. And the themes are usually not my cup of tea either. But this... just clicked. For such a ragey theme it's quite relaxing to play and dead easy to pick up and enjoy. The minis are wonderful and really add to the experience, not just in look but also in feel (placing them, moving them etc). Card drafting is really good fun, looking for combos too. I really like the fact that the system can incentivise losing battles too. AND we only played 2p which I understand is not the game at its best at all! We immediately played again and again, and I really want to play again right now. Lovely lovely game, so pleased I bought it.

Superb Game. I played 2p 3p and 4p and had a blast in all 3, each one had subtle differences in strategy. I would play this game any chance I have.

This game is highly refined, for example the amount of provinces available to pillage each game is spot on. And this game flows well it is quick, decisive and brutal. Hale Brothers, Pillage Yggdrasil!

I dont like drafting mechanism at all. That is said this game is so much better then any combat game even Kemet but i didnt find what to love so much. It seems overhyped and so random. Drafting is the main mechanic and trying to remember which cards i have given to my right is painful. Cards always making great differences and mostly makes no sense.

Inis and Kemet is so much better than this game. I absolutely dont get the hype.

I really dont like that game but still i will give it another chance. May be i am missing something.

After few plays: You must play several times to love this game and you must learn cards too. When all players get equal experience on the game and cards, it becomes a marvellous game. Great area control. Easy to teach and learn, lots to explore with every new game, super thematic, many ways to win. Brilliant!

Fundamentally solid, strategically-deep game that takes full advantage of its drafting dynamic. Absolutely agree with other commenters that any type of alliance, vendetta, weak early game (by little fault of your own)...almost *anything* can remove you from consideration early and piss (most) people off.

Game based on the nordic mythology were different tribes of vikings compete for being the most glorious one. I was very surprised when I first play this game. The owner was explaining the rules and I was thinking "man, these rules are too easy. This game is going to be boring" but, during the game, my interest started to grow as I find myself with several options every turn, and the things to do, were to put the minis, which card to play, what strategy to follow, and just with some very easy rules, the game came alive very smoothly and making a lot of sense. It is true that the mechanics could be applied to very different themes, there is not huge relationship between the vikings and what you do during the game but, however, it is fun to play and there is an adequate strategy and planning that has to be done in order to win.
And then, the great mechanic of the game, clearly, is the Ragnarok. When you first listen about the rule that after each era one location is going to be destroyed because of the Glorious Ragnarok, you think that better get off all my minis from that place, but when you realize that dying under that fireball is, in fact, a great way of earning points, it is when the fun starts.
One of the concerns that I have heard and experienced is that there are some special miniatures that break the balance of the game. I do not think that the differences are that big, but it is a point to be considered.
Positive:
1. Great artwork
2. Great miniatures
3. The Glorious Ragnarok
4. Several strategies are possible
5. Easy to play
6. Drafting mechanic
Negative:
1. Some characters may be too powerful
2. Some expansions should be used
3. Some KS miniatures are no longer available

Blood Rage is all the worst aspects of my favorite genre. As an area control game it fails in that playing offensively is punished by extending the game. As a drafting game it fails in that counter drafting powerful cards from your opponents leaves you with a bunch of garbage. No element works as well as it should.

Play Inis instead.

Arguably I shouldn't be rating this since I only played the first third of a game. But I think I got a decent idea from just that much. I also think it's helped by my rock bottom expectations going in, but I really enjoyed what I played and it seemed like the rest of the game would build on it nicely. When the first round was over I really wanted to keep playing to see the rest of the game.

The card drafting works well, in particular the hands are large enough and the player count is small enough that you'll see hands multiple times. I'm always happy with deterministic combat and it seems like you can do some cool stuff with well timed pillages in terms of moving people around. But I think my favorite thing was the customization and differentiation of the factions and the way that affects the way different players will play. I'd have really liked to see that through to the end to see how the different players developed and what kinds of power combos you could end up with. But already in the first round I was seeing some nice differentiation. I think my first reaction to it was to give it an 8, but between the components and just wanting to hedge a bit I'm going with a 7.5.

In the back of my mind I'm wondering if part of the reason I was as impressed with this game as I was is because it's not a genre I have much experience with. Recently all the new euros I play just feel like more of the same and that hurts their ratings, whereas Blood Rage feels fresh to me, but I can't really say in any qualified manner if it actually is doing anything particularly unique.

Blood Rage is not the usual type of game I enjoy, but it's hard to deny it is good at what it does. It can run a little slow at times, but even in the downtime the tension is off the charts. It also has some unique mechanics - chiefly that losing battles can be part of a valid approach.

It's not all to my liking, though. While there are some events one can plan around, the game is mostly a game of tactics, with only the board state and some upgrades - all of which may or may not be useful based on the cards one sees in the draft. Personally, I enjoy a bit more long-term planning. The game also shrinks the board as advanced tactics and powers appear. This might add tension, but it kills the ability to focus on building an engine - something else I like doing in games.

If this sounds like the kind of game you like, you are gonna love it. But even for those who usually don't enjoy this sort of game, it's worth playing.

The font and cards and the map are awful; the choice of text colours against backgrounds - e.g. grey text on a grey background - is never going to help with gameplay.

It's a puzzle about (a) trying to guess the state of the board when you play a particular card and (b) maxing out scoring from card-combos.  Lots of swinginess from hidden information on; and I have no desire to play again.  

Sorry, Blood Rage.  I know you wanted me to love you and your plastic monsters are impressive, but it's just not worked out between us.  I'm moving back in with Chaos in the Old World.

Very interesting drafting/area control game.

Minis are very good quality for board game components.

The theme fits in very well as you're trying to earn the most glory as the end times approaches and cities are destroyed in its wake. Gain points for winning fights and even losing fights. Even the slain will bring you glory.

Expansions add a little bit of variety to the game but the only one I really think is almost required is the Mystics of Midgard. This adds the mystics which can displace one opponents non-unique units which adds a little extra strategy to deploying your warriors. The expansion is also very simple to add and adds more drafting variety.

Initial Rating: 4.0 (November 2015)

I wasn’t expecting much from Cool Mini or Not´s Blood Rage but still the game managed to disappoint me.

The rules are uber easy to grasp, the theme is cool except for the fact that you don´t feel you are a Viking fighting epic battles. Blood Rage is a control area game with some drafting between turns. For me the game fails miserably. 

First I have heard that the game offered “exquisitely” hard decisions in the drafting because all the cards were equally powerful but from my point of view that’s not true. The drafting is obvious in all regards, perhaps at the very beginning you don’t know what to do but after you have a couple of cards you need to pick the cards that complement your previous cards and game situation. It takes seconds to decide this because it is very obvious which card is the best one. I also feel there is a huge unbalance with the cards, for example the monsters can affect the game in a huge way (as the Orc in the first Age) and it is pure luck if you manage to draw one of the powerful ones, there is only one card per monster so it falls to the players to balance the game. To summarize I found the draft to be obvious and the cards to be unbalanced. Lots of uncontrollable luck here.

Second, the area control in Blood Rage fails for me as well because often, the loser of the combat wins almost as many points as the winner, it feels out of sync when a player does this, that is, it feels weird when a control area game allows and rewards a player when they lose control of an area. Besides purposefully losing battles doesn’t fit thematically in any combat game.

Blood Rage also features the (hated by me) “attack the perceived leader” and it lends itself to king-making situations. I heavily dislike both of this characteristics. In our game, it was a foregone conclusion who would win it even before the second age was finished, so it has a rich-gets-richer problem as well.

Blood Rage uses the same core mechanism that Chaos in the Old World (limited number of action points) from the same designer (Eric M. Lang), but the gameplay is a lot easier. When I play Blood Rage I feel I’m wasting my precious gaming time because the decision are too obvious, the game too shallow and its length way too much for what it offers (around 2 hours). I was expecting a heavier experience but the game is much lighter than I had hoped.

As is usual from Cool Mini or Not, the game components are amazing. The miniatures are unbelievable gorgeous and look great on the table. The art is very good as well and that’s the only positive I have to say about the game. Cool Mini or Not´s games usually follow this formula, they are gorgeous, incredible looking games, but sadly, they are also ultimately empty games. I’m clearly not their intended audience. I feel that if the game was regular looking it would not have the success it has today, that is, they put a lot of effort on the outside while the inside is very mediocre.
 
It is a very expensive game.

Bottom line, I know I´m on the very small minority, but I dislike Blood Rage. I feel the ONLY thing the game brings to the table are the marvelous miniatures, everything else fails for me. It has obvious decisions, it is a shallow and light game, its game duration is way too high for such a simple game, it has lots of uncontrollable luck. I would play Chaos in the Old World any day over Blood Rage. Way overrated, I already sold my copy.

Fun miniatures war game. Some degree of luck with card availability.  Great component quality. The monsters which special abilities are super fun to handle and deploy and the plastic ring system for sharing monsters in the pool is quite genius. 

Where blood rage shines is that players do not win simply based on succeeding in combat. Instead, players must strategically draft cards and plan their moves to manage their available resources (i.e. rage),to complete quests, and perhaps even lose in battle in order to gain glory points for being in or returning from Valhalla. 

There is luck element which is mostly (but not totally) mitigated by card drafting. For instance a monster upgrade is drawn and kept by the original player the chances of it being passed to the next player is quite low. Similarly, a player may not be able to get a quest card, or a high-numbered battle card, if those cards are retained by the original recipients of the cards.

Six plays in over a three month period, and I I find this game just does it for me. 

Looks? Yeah, obviously. Interaction? In spades - you can't play your own game in isolation, you absolutely have to consider what the others will do as without a doubt it will affect you. Tension? Deciding which cards to pass on can be agonising, let alone which actions to take at which parts of your turn - timing is crucial. Euro-efficiency-mongering - getting the right card combos can be huge, allowing you to really fly. Fights? Oh yes, combat is not scarce or optional (see Scythe), and you had better know which fights to pick and which to avoid. Sneaky? - just check out the Loki cards, the opportunities for turning bad into good are immense.... Man, I love this game.

One play only so far (I'm sure there will be more), fantastic mix of the best bits of Euro-gaming with the tension and interaction of a (light) wargame

- Very fun, looks great on the table, not too difficult to teach, plays fairly quickly considering the scope, but not so fast that you feel like it definitely needs one more round.
- Haven't played it with 2 players, but I do have the 5 player expansion. Recommend with 4-5 players. 3 can be king-makey, and I expect 2 will suffer from runaway leader.
- I love all the monsters and upgrades, but you have to balance these in the draft. I find this decision process really interesting... I really want this ability, but I know I'll be able to pull off this quest, and that battle card is awesome too... Decisions decisions.
- I also like the timing elements. When to push, when to plunder, etc. You want to do things in a particular order to be as efficient with your rage as possible, however you're often pressured to do things out of sequence to take advantage of an opportunity or prevent someone from throwing a spanner in your works.

RATING: 7
This game is fun and exciting.  The theme is well-done in the art and mechanics and there are a few different strategies to play.  This game has a lot of really powerful actions players can take, and after 5-10 plays, I suspect there are a few cards a player nearly always wants to pick if they have the option.  On one hand, this makes the players feel powerful and the game more fun and exciting, on the other, it can lead to big swings and a little less importance for playing well all game.  Personally, while I appreciate Blood Rage and am definitely willing to play it again, I tend to like games that are more "battles for inches" instead of the "battle for miles" that is Blood Rage.

I was convinced that I would love this game from the first picture of the Fire Giant. After reading the rules I backed it, all in. I watched the campaign every day, I was excited as one can be for a game. 

Normally, for me, I usually back a game excited and by the time it shows up I've either cooled way off, or some series of terrible delays or terrible post campaign management sours me on the game.

Blood Rage had a few bumps and a tiny delay, but my excitement never wained. The day it arrived I was sitting on my porch like a loyal dog awaiting the return of their missing owner. The mail lady was completely irritated with me.

I didn't get to play the game until today, three annoying days after it arrived.

I'm thrilled to say my excitement wasn't wasted. :D

This game has a lot going for it — interesting cards, good decisions regarding the timing of your actions, and best of all, the ability to score points in many different ways. 

It's somewhat funny to me that so many who praise this game would criticize other games for being a point salad, when this one is very close to being one itself. Ultimately, I can tolerate the game (though the title is not appealing to me) even if it is not my preferred genre/theme.

Normally when I approach this “point salad” style of game, I expect to finish within 2 victory points of everyone else… Regardless of what anyone does. Not so in Blood Rage! My decisions mattered… A Lot. What cards I draft, which cards I use and when, where I place my units and when. Who to go after (and when not to)… Even how and when to have my guys die and go to Valhalla!

first play I was disappointed by how some cards might seem like they were good but are really terrible and others seem like theyre bad but are insanely awesome.  that counter-intuitiveness and the fact that you can win big time by losing battles makes this a pretty neat game

Let's start with the miniatures: superb sculpts in the upper echelon of mini quality. Although the female sculpts hardly look ready for a good fight in their skimpy outfits. Sex sells, including on KS. This game is a hybrid ameritrash/euro with the balance scaled towards the 'trash' side. Over three rounds players hate-draft and play a cutthroat take-that area control game where chaos rules and outcomes are hard to predict. Go 'all-in' the first round, lose or get a draw and play a game of catch-up for the remaining time. Card combos are simplistic in nature with very strong take-that effects to make sure you can retaliate out of anger or do some serious leader bashing. Hence the games fitting name: blood rage!

Blood Rage scratches an itch I don't have. A game that achieves its design goals quite well yet I care neither for its parts or sum.

I'm not a fan of card drafting, card combos, special powers, or compounding abilities toward bigger badder moves. I find the game is largely about the draft and moving up the 3 tech tracks with the board as a stage for these things to play out. Early scoring is small and secondary to moving up the tracks and gaining upgrades toward bigger scoring opportunities in round 3. 

I'd suggest drafting/buying cards Dominion style (the game is essentially deck-building/hand mgt from age-to-age) but I doubt it would significantly alter my feelings. As it is, drafting prevents AP and downtime but at the cost of increased luck into a very significant part of the game.

I understand why it's popular: shiny bits, fantasy theme, euro point maximizer underneath; ultimately a familiar song with a new arrangement. It feels like 7 Wonders and Cosmic Encounter but played out on a board with Viking dudes. I bet the Dice Tower crowd is nuts for this. 

A funny aside, despite all the shiny chrome I never really felt the theme. Instead I found it easy to ignore in favor of maximizing points. But hey it's a euro with a lot of chrome. Neither good or bad.

RATING: 6
For a game that revolves around cataclysmic violence and death, Blood Rage feels dismayingly tame. To be fair, I’m not sure there is a way to make card drafting feel like cataclysmic death. Perhaps that is for the best. The much ballyhooed minis and Frazetta-esque graphic sensibilities live up to their billing. Though not a gateway game in the usual sense, Blood Rage may be a good first step into the world of heavier, dudes-on-a-map strategy games for those who are curious about the genre.

This is just a first impression rating after one play. The game looks amazing and many aspects are well done and fun. I was just not keen on the degree of take that. Sure, it is a combat game, you expect to beat up on each other, but a few of the cards and the Loki strategy of winning by losing was too much. One remedy to defeating a predominant strategy when there is a draft is to draft some cards purely for blocking, which works, but is not satisfying for me. Also, I know we played a rule incorrectly that may have made the problem worse. I hope to play again to continue to formulate a final rating. I am sure that there are strategies to counter any of the cards that become apparent after more plays, so I am not saying that the Loki strategy/cards are over-powered; but it is an aspect of the game that is less satisfying for me.

Not for me, despite the many good qualities.

I didn`t want to play it in the first plays because it seemd to brutal and combat focused, But it is actually more strategic than I thought and quite interesting and suspenseful to play with a lot of suprise moments.

Much simpler than Chaos in the Old World. CitOW has a much more sophisticated set of interactions among powers and spells and requires players to be much more pro-active about checking one another when they surge for the victory. Blood Rage feels more like a conventional Euro in that players are most interested in building an engine to amass points for victory and strategizing from the draft how best to power their engine. Personally, I prefer CitOW (which has more "story" to it), but Blood Rage is a perfectly adequate substitute for those who want a more teachable and less violent theme.

As an aside, I would recommend letting new players know the possible variety of battle cards and having a reference card for the monsters (so no one gets an unfortunate surprise).

Wow. Production quality is second-to-none. Theme is on point. Fun factor is through the roof. I love this game. I'm not sure if it will eventually wear out its welcome (there aren't as many cards as I'd like), but the drafting mechanism makes me think it won't as there will always be new strategies to try. Right now, one of my favourites. My wife even enjoys it despite the theme.

Probably my favorite game, such that I rate it a 10 even though it is clearly an imperfect one. Balance issues are significant enough that the draft mechanic isn't enough to counter the luck involved with getting the right 1st pick or 2 card combo. This game is more often decided during the draft phase than it should be, but even so it is one of the most fun games you can ever play while losing. Winning feels great. but even getting beat can be hilarious at times. Almost reminds me of Cosmic Encounter or something in that way (which is a crazy but somewhat apt comparison overall).

I avoided the game for a long time because of the KS hype and the FFG-style artwork, though essentially it is a family-style euro with Ameritrash thematic trappings. This is a big draw for many, but for me it is more of a liability. The game itself is mechanically sound, it works. It is fun, combat is quick and decisive, and there really is room for truly skillful play. I know this because thus far I have lost by so many points that I am intrigued to keep trying. On my second play I was lapped on the score track!

The vanilla game (without all the expansions) plays pretty much like how I expected it to. Its a simple card drafting game similar to Midgard and really quite abstract.

This is a masterpiece: a Euro game dressed in a thick enough layer of AT theme to please both crowds. I love the drafting, the combat system, the multiple strategies, the tracks and the upgrade cards. I'd love to have a bigger pool, so that not every card would come up every game. One nitpick is that the game seems much bigger, much deeper and more complex than it really is: this is one step up from 7 Wonders, not much more than that. And without the minis, this could be a 25$ game, and play just as well.

I was surprised how much I enjoyed this game. The combination of Nordic mythology,  raging Vikings, and miniatures isn't one I would normally seek out, but I'm happy I overcame my skepticism and played. The depth of strategy is wonderful, the interaction between players is intense, and the theme is completely engaging. Get it while you can.

I have a love-hate relationship with this game. I love the map, figures, drafting, and actions. However, if a person plays a key card, it can really cripple someone else and/or launch them ahead, which leaves me a bit cold. Still, it's thematic and plays fairly quick once everyone knows how to play, which is impressive for this genre.

From a new player's perspective this is yet another game in the FFG cards-and-creatures mould where action economy and synergies are the be-all and end-all, and the game really rewards you if you get it right, and really stomps you if you don't know what to expect. You may think you're drafting goodies but in reality you've already lost, or maybe someone screws you over with a take-that effect while someone else is running away with the win. I'm kinda indifferent to the theme and minis, but I guess they make it easier to assess parts of the game state. Still waiting for a chance to finish a game of Chaos in the Old World...

Personally I would've rated this an 8... but I can see this not being for everyone. And a game that is so divisive does kinda get some minus points for me...

Gameplay wise it's really fun though. That being said... painting would be really nice for this game. Most board games can be done unpainted and then usually have minis in player colours. These minis are blank and thus kinda whisper to you... "Hey. Hey you. Paint us. Do iiiiiiiiiiiit..."

A very good area control game with drafting and lots of 'take that'. The Loki kind of cards (gain upon losing) might be a bit too common though...

Hmm, for some time it was best ameritrash game I have played in long time. In the end it was replaced by SW: Rebellion. Also I usually enjoy proper historical wargames more. 

but still I must say that I was plesantly surprised how easy is this game to play, how quickly it flows. there are various strategies, etc...

there are also things I do not like (for example or all nothing combat - but I can tolerate it more in ameritrash then in wargame).

Instant 9.  This game shockingly lived up to the hype and then some.  I'm hoping this game gets even better with more plays and when we introduce the expansion stuff.

Possibly the best minis ever included in a board game.

Update: this game IS even better with more plays, I'm bumping it to a 9.5

Second update: It's the end of 2016 and even though I've played this more than 10 times, I still haven't played with all the expansions and kick starter stuff.  This game is incredible.

What I like about this game is it fixes the snowball effect of conflict games by introducing the Loki deck so the losing players gains things to not fall behind. The winner also loses his combat card so others are more likely to win the following clashes. The drafting is quick but when playing with AP prone people I do two drafts from 4 cards each to make the drafting simpler. As people get stronger you feel like the game will drag on but there are less spaces because of Ragnarok so it evens out. Highly recommend this game!

2017-03-03 - 7.5 - Finally I managed to play this game. I liked it, however not as much as I could expect from the hype. But still quite a bit. I think that second game can be better, as I know what cards can do. 
It's mostly area control game with fights, which I would like to be a little more exciting. There is not many ways to change number of figures in regions otherwise. 
I like that there are few ways to gain points and you can focus on your individual strategy, but other players still can mess with your plans.
I think I would like to own it but rather from a trade than a shop.

2017-11-04 - 7.5->7 - Is it a big drop? Not really. I just played again and like other games I rated with 7.5 a little better. This one is good too and sometimes it's really nice to jump onto one another. It's fine with 3 but better with 4. I guess the game is a little better as players have some picture what the cards can do and what you can expect.

2017-12-06 - 7->6 - I feel I always rated this game higher than I felt about it, probably because of all the hype and high expectations. It's fine, but I prefer Nexus Ops to have a quick fight with miniatures on a map and Bunny Kingdom to have an awesome drafting experience. This one is OK, but I will get rid of it eventually.

This game is a blast. Love the card drafting mechanic and based on how cards are dealt, your strategy can vary wildly game-to-game. Combos can be huge and runaway scores with a few players isn't uncommon, but it is still fun to battle with everyone. The miniatures and boards are stellar as well. Wish I could get it to the table more. Four players seems ideal, but would not play with less than three.

Great theme, great pacing, multiple win strategies, fun situations, great card draft. 

Things that keep it from 10 Stars: Some things are just unintuitive from the drafting cards/ruleset. The mechanisms are not that hard but some seem a bit forced on. Can be tough if you play bad.

Minions are great, Player Mats not amazing. Not as good with 2

There is a lot in this game - card drafting, miniatures, area control, no dice rolling in combat. I like how everything is simple, tied together and still fast and tactical. There is however an issue. Strategies are really not balanced and to draft cards which are useless for you just because you cant allow your opponent to collect full Loki, is bad mechanism. Still one of the best competitive games I have ever played.

Have played 3 games: two 2 player and one 3 player.
Massive re-playability between adopting vastly different strategies and drafting different cards. 
Plays pretty fast for the type of game it is.
The only reason this isn't a 10 is because, though there isn't any "I win" cards, there are a few combos that are relatively easy to obtain. 
I also don't love the 60 glory point bonus for maxing stats. Seems a bit much to me. 
I'm assuming both my negatives could simply be because we haven't played enough games to hate draft or guard the center better.

Finally a game that drafts card and lets me do amazing things with them afterward. Using a solid Norse/Viking theme, Blood Rage is everything I could hope for a game with awesome miniatures. This occupies the same space as Kemet for me, and I much prefer this to Kemet. Battles can be rewarding for both players, and the draft is highly strategical, until you're pitching cards due to winning more battles than you expected. A lot of depth to this. A great euro that initially looks like an ameritrash game.

OK game. 

fun enough but a bit long for what it offered. felt like a light game that was about 50% longer than it should be.

major turn off for me - power ramp up in the last round was too pronounced - scoring 3/4 of your points in the last 1/3 of the game felt wrong.

RATING: 4
I can see why some people might like this. It is not for me though. I feel like too much is decided by the draft. The rest of the game is just going through the motions. There is simply to little you can do to adapt during the actual game phase. If someone drafted a really good combo, there very little that can be done to adapt and counter the strategy if you did not actively draft for it. All that's left is to sit back and watch someone execute their power combo time and time again with no recourse.

RATING: 9.5
Amazing game that blends Euro and Amerithrash into one cohesive unit. All of the miniatures are very attractive, but my favorite part of the game is that there are many possible strategies and they are all viable. If you want to lose every battle youre in, you can win the whole game if you play your cards right. I only wish the base game played 5.

RATING: 7
Fun game with various strategies formed from drafting cards. I like how there's no dice to determine combat results and that you have a good idea what cards other people have from the drafting. Biggest issue is trying to remember what other player's abilities are whilst also managing your own goals.

I suspect the 'death' strategy is probably the easiest as it's harder to stop someone from losing a fight. Tip: don't draft too many expensive cards as you'll exhaust your rage to quick.

Whilst I enjoy it, there's something that stops me from loving it. Can't say it's the luck element in what cards you draft as there are a lot of awesome cards and you will always have good ones to pick. The direct conflict maybe?

While I am still caught up in the hype of this game, I worry about its long-term staying power. The miniatures are fantastic, but the game feels like it might have a runaway leader problem after several games. I've included Blood Rage on my 10x10 Challenge for 2017, so hopefully more plays will unveil the game that I hope this is.

EDIT: This game is definitely a winner and a contender for my favorite game. I have dumped WAY more money into it than I would have ever wanted to but the result is a fantastic experience that my game group absolutely adores.

The one caveat: this game takes 3-4 games before everything starts to feel balanced. The first few games someone gets a great combo and the other players don't know how to counter it. However next games everyone will look out for that strategy and change tactics to compensate.

10/23/16 - My 2 cents.  This game had a lot of positive hype and I knew it was an Eric Lang game, so I was interested.  I watched a few videos before I purchased this and it seemed very complicated, but I went for it anyway.  I will let you know that once you start playing the game mechanics are actually easy to learn.  You do have several choices of what to do, but once you get those down, the game flows pretty quickly and you will really like all of your options.

In Blood Rage, each player controls their own Viking clan’s warriors, leader, and ship. Ragnarök has come, and it’s the end of the world! It’s the Vikings’ last chance to go down in a blaze of glory and secure their place in Valhalla at Odin’s side! For a Viking there are many pathways to glory. You can invade and pillage the land for its rewards, crush your opponents in epic battles, fulfill quests, increase your clan's stats, or even die gloriously either in battle or from Ragnarök, the ultimate inescapable doom.

So, is it a hybrid or a pure Euro? It's not easy to answer - it's like a theme-driven Euro that has a strong AT feel. It also seems to have a strong runaway leader problem until players gain more or less the same experience level; after that, multiplayer leader-bashing might help stopping runaway leaders. The game is quite a good fun area majority stuff but it's rather cruel as only clear winners of that area gain anything while the rest are punished hard(removed from the board).
This, combined with the simultaneous card play during area majority 'fights' make it less of the pure euro many claim it to be even though its mechanism elements all can be found in different Euros (mostly about drafting and area majority, a bit even worker placementish). Still, it's quite enjoyable and I guess it's even better when beginner's mistakes aren't made anymore.

I love that the game is full of broken comboes. When you have experienced players it is all about getting the best combo and setting up the board to get the most points from it.

FIRST IMPRESSION:

Really enjoyed my first game with three players. The board becomes squeezed quite quickly and there is no avoiding conflict. The different cards frequently feel overly powerful and it is helpful to know what type of cards are in the deck and have potential to be played. The minis are nicely constructed and detailed as expected. Also think the opportunity to "recruit" two monsters to help quite interesting as some of them look quite intimidating on the board and fits well with the theme. Letting someone win the middle the first two rounds of the game might not be a good idea...

Definitely has some similarities to Chaos of the Old World but this one is a simpler design and one constructs your Viking tribe as the game continues by playing upgrades which will differentiate the different players and their powers a la 7 Wonders style draft at the start of each round.

RATING: 6
june 2016: Last month I decided to treat myself to a big box, epic, Ameritrash style game and I decided on Blood Rage.  I've played Blood Rage three times now and I can state with certaintity: I am absolutely crap at this game. I don't just lose when I play, I get obliterated. The game really doesn't seem to suit me, hence my lower than average score. I've racked my brain as to why the game and I don't click and have come to the following conclusions.

1. Blood Rage is predominantly a card game. Yes, it has a board and yes it has crazy overproduced miniatures, but the game is all in the cards. So much so that if anyone decided to make a cardgame version of Blood Rage, it would need little tweaking. Card games aren't my strongest suit. I am a better strategic player than I am a tactical one. The card drafting at the beginning of each round is highly random. Only extensive knowlegde of the cards and memory of what your opponents choose can slightly mitigate this luck. My knowlegde of the cards isn't good enough, but every time I loose I've lost to players who've played the game for the first time. So card knowlegde can't have been the only factor.

2. Blood Rage is a tableau builder. The player who quickly builds his or her tableau has the edge over other players. And that edge can be very hard to catch up to. In my opinion the game suffers from a runaway leader. Twice have I lost the game because a player with better stats became unbeatable by the other players. End game scores where the winner has twice the points of the other players have been the norm around here.

Some people are under the false impression that Blood Rage is a mixture of a eurogame and an ameritrash game. I really don't agree with that. Blood Rage is an Ameritrash game through and through. The six cards you get each round aren't enough to think of a strategic gameplan. In most eurogames, your strategy is yours to choose. In Blood Rage, more often than not, you're at the mercy of the cards you've been dealt. It is too random and chaotic for a eurogame. And after Eldritch Horror, Imperial Assault and  X-Wing, Blood Rage has started to put me off these American style games. I probably won't get rid of Blood Rage yet. I'd like to see how my thoughts on the game will change after I've played it some more. But Blood Rage has go to be the biggest gaming  disappointment  of 2016 for me.

+ I like the fast turns (single action).
+ I like how each player customizes their clan throughout the game.  
- The theme is superficial, with card names that don't have much relationship with the effect.  
+ The rules are simple enough. 
$ The game feels smaller than Clockwork Wars, because of the relative lack of flavor, because of the more restricted mechanisms. 
+ Quick battles.
- I can't help thinking that this game (even the base game) has almost too many minis: I prefer games with fewer minis but more game/flavor/richness (e.g. Clockwork Wars). I feel that they add a bit too much fluff to the game.
$ The game feel is essentially that of a series of short combats for quantitative improvements (the 3 tracks), with a constant interaction between players (who compete for the territories), and a progressive customization of each player.
+ The terrain is small enough that many battles happen, with an interesting center that can be joined from everywhere (important for reinforcements), but territories that remain a bit far from each other that positioning is meaningful for battles (too far and you can't reinforce).

Overall: a lean-enough game of many small battles, with limited flavor. Almost a dry euro-like game of battles with some chrome (minis, some background but not much flavor). Well done, though, but not "wide" or flavorful enough for me to be in awe (contrary to Clockwork Wars).

This is usually not my kind of thing and I didn't have high hopes for it, but it actually wasn't too bad for me. I decided to try out a "kill off all my own guys" strategy and while I still came in last it was close, and seemed somewhat viable, which is unusual.

I'm not a huge DOAM guy and I own Nexus Ops, which I like a lot and completely satisfies my wants in this area. I also like Chaos in the Old World, and while I think I liked this more than CitOW in many ways, I wouldn't chuck it in favor of Blood Rage. So it's a good game that just has no particular usefulness to me.

Initial Impressions: Basically met my expectations but not my hopes, as in it seemed as good as I would imagine from reading the rules, but not as good as the current 8.38 rating + good reviews + finally a good thematic Viking game + factoring in the high cost. As I thought before playing the card drafting doesn't really fit thematically with the game at all. Also I wish there was a little bit more differentiation from each of the smaller unique monsters, some are just stronger versions of others. 

Besides the drafting and the area control the order you perform your actions appear to be pretty important. Also you must choose very carefully which battles you intend to win, as using your high value battle card early can easily screw you over later on if you're not careful. Therefore, this game is more strategic than I thought it would be; the game definitely does not play itself after the drafting phase.

You don't use all the cards each game even for a given player count so there is a little bit variability there.  Also the locations of which bonuses go in which locations and which locations are destroyed create variability too, but we'll see if it's enough as I play this game more. There are multiple ways to score in winning battles, completing quests, purposefully losing some battles with the right set of cards, and getting your units all destroyed by Ragnarok, so at the very least I should be kept busy for a bit in choosing which of those I want to focus more on.

Runaway leader appears to be an issue as if you win battles/complete quests your stats will go up which will allow you to do more stuff later on. 

EDIT: Somehow I've gotten family members who normally can't play anything heavier than Lords or Waterdeep to able have a basic understanding of how this game works. If this proves true for other groups this would be a great boon to this game as being a game I can use has a "next-steps" game without me having to compromise in my game choice. I sometimes wish the combat cards worked similar to Kemet where unit destruction is not directly tied with winning battles, although this would make the strategy to get your units destroyed significantly weaker. 

EDIT 2: There are a lot more cool card combos than I initially anticipated, the core mechanisms of the game have continued to be fairly easy to understand (though there are quite a few less prominent rules that are easy to miss), and I think this game worked very well with 4 players.

I've pretty much said holy shit every time I've opened the box to play on account of the miniatures.

After 8 plays since I got it, I cannot think of a single reason to not give this a 10.  Every single time I've played I've wanted to play again immediately after. I know that my set of the game will be destroyed via play over the years, which is the highest possible praise for a board game.

Some cards can decide the game when drafted. If the person who gets it first understands this, then the game feels too preordained. Also, if you don't know ALL the cards and how they work together, your at a huge disadvantage. That is too much study for a game of this type IMO.

look, Blood Rage looks great and plays fast.   but drafting is a huge part of the game (which I'm not a fan of) and for this kind of asymmetrical area control, I'd rather play Chaos in the Old World.

I liked the game, but I think the miniatures are just unnecessary to got a better grip on kickstarter. I might have bought the game if it came with some wooden markers or cardboard standees for a reasonable price point. I also think that the miniatures are not distinctive enough to provide an advantage over standees or meeple-variations.

Most overhyped game I have ever played. I am still giving this game a chance and each time the game fail. You cant play it with a new player because you will destroy him (unless you hint him the best tactic in this game (we all know what it is after even 1 game) then he will destroy you). Game is playable only with 4 or 5, the other player counts are just strange. My rating is 7 because -"usually willing to play" but only to check if I and a bunch of people I play with are missing something.

A internesting euro, masquerading as a war game.  The game begins with a card draft.  You then spend rage to take actions on the board or with cards.  Some actions don't require rage like plundering a town.  

The game is incredibly deep.  On the surface, it may seem that aggressiveness will pay in a game called Blood Rage, but actually, it often comes down to timing.  The temporal element of this game is a big factor, and knowing when and where to act is important.  You can spend a lot of cards opposing someone and getting nothing for it.  

The game can be swingy as well.  Odin's throne can really help someone in last place and turn the whole game around for you.  

But on the whole, the game is great.  It may crack my top ten.  Fun family game as well but the kids need to be at least 12 or so to play.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
The most over-produced not-really-dudes-on-a-map game (until Rising Sun).  Definitely not a war game despite appearances, as you frequently can earn more points losing battles and sending your figures to Valhalla.  It's a card drafting game with a little bit of area control mixed in.  The cards are what make the game.  You can build your own victory point engine by choosing carefully.  The miniatures are just fun to look at.  If you go in with the right expectations it is a fun game that plays quickly.

By and far my favorite board game.  Plays great with both my friends as well as my family.  The card drafting phase is a great way for players to select which upgrade/combat/quest cards they want per round as opposed to just a random draw.  

Customizing your clan of vikings is a very neat and rewarding aspect of this game and is governed largely by the card drafting phase.  Players often have to make critical decisions between taking combat cards or upgrade cards.  The addition of the large monsters with added combat bonuses is also a great feature.  

Depending on which cards you choose, you can customize your clan to actually benefit more greatly from purposely loosing battles by using the Loki cards. There are also combat cards that can be played that completely negate the effect of the other players combat cards, steal rage for losing a battle, or make players throw away their combat cards and be forced to select another.  With all of these options available, you never know how the outcome of a battle will play out until it is over.  Many times I've seen small clans beat much larger ones due to proper play of combat and upgrade cards.  Many times in this game, the player who wins the most battles is not the player with the most glory (victory) points at the end of the game.

Overall, this is the best amerithrash style game that I've ever played and I can't recommend it enough.

Kickstarter pledge - One of the best miniature-games with an interesting and deep theme as well as wonderful miniatures. Especially the kickstarter-exclusive monster miniatures are awesome. The drafting mechanism leads to different games every time you play. There are some powerful combinations, but you have to get the appropriate cards. Even with five players the playing time is moderate, so that there is always room for a revanche.

This game is a Home Run, no, a Grand Slam. I have played Blood Rage maybe 30 times and have never gotten bored of it. I have a weekly gathering with my work group gamers and we have all reached very high levels of experience. Playing this one with a group like that is some of the best board game moments/stories I have had to date.

I spent the time to carefully paint every model, we all agree with that extra bit of ambiance, the game feels so much better.

This is my favorite game I have ever played. I thoroughly enjoyed nearly every aspect of this game. The production, layout, theme, and mechanics of this game scratch every fancy bone I have for table top games. 

Strategy wise, I feel that there are a lot of valid options. I like having options for scoring and building my units in multiple ways. I get the feeling that this is the type of game that experienced players play better than new players. I actually really enjoy that because it forces strategy. 

I highly recommend this game. If my close friends didn't already own this, I would have bought this already.

There's quite a bit to like about Blood Rage:
-simple, streamlined play
-plays fairly quickly
-card drafting! (something I always find enjoyable)
-clan upgrades (all clans start out the same, but will differ from game to game based on the strategies you pursue & cards you draft)
-limited # of action points per round so you have to be aware of what you want/need to do and plan ahead
-various paths to victory

Cleveland was not a fan so I don't see this staying on my shelf since it's such a large box (and a bit pricey) and is best with 4.  Would likely play Nexus Ops instead (and Cleveland does enjoy that game).  They're not the same mechanically, but close enough game play experience for me.

A teriffic game that combines hand management with area dominance and a bit of worker (Viking!) placement. The different strategies allow every player to take a different path to victory with points flying everywhere. Timing your moves is vital, as waiting for the perfect combo may allow another player to pillage that province you wanted so badly.

I really want to like this game, but I am having a hard time finding how it is not completely reactionary and very random. I find it odd that the easiest strategy is the one where you plan on losing the battles all the time.  I don't think it is unbeatable but it is certainly easier than the others and if every other player at the table doesn't work to stop it then it usually succeeds.  For now I consider this one too random (and i like random games) to play often.  Too bad because it had such good promise.

Two player lacks the enthusiasm over the time.
Would like to play it more often with 3 or 4.
Liked to paint the miniatures a lot.

negative:
With the drafting it depends where you sit (before or after an experienced player who knows which cards to pick/deny for the OP combos)
to be good you have to know all the cards of all ages and keep track of who played which card and try to predict who has picked which card.

I like how it plays. I don't like the (hate) draft. If it wouldn't be to random with the battle cards sometimes I would prefere to deal cards and don't draft.
Maybe try to only deal half the hand. Reduces the play time also.

(3/17) 9. Really cool, cramped area control game with a very cool, "diversifying" card draft at the beginning of each round and plenty of unavoidable, yet not overly punishing combat.

RATING: 7
A fun Dudes-On-The-Map game with lots of playability due to the numerous abilities and monsters to use in the game.  It's surprisingly very easy to teach since all the information is both on the cards and playmat.  In terms of pacing, it plays pretty quickly since you are able to do only ONE action per turn instead of multiple (more board games need to do this).  The game ends shortly after the climax and doesn't overstay its welcome.

However, I don't feel the "need" to own this game.

The first glaring problem with the game is the simple fact that you need to know the decks inside out to play at any competent level.  Otherwise, the game just feels like you are along for the ride with no real direction to follow.  I've seen experienced players take advantage of their neighboring newbies because of newbies didn't realize that passing certain cards to him would just make him powerful.

Which leads to my next issue: The drafting.  It's weak and feels like a mechanic was taped onto the game to "balance" the meta the way auctions were used to "balance" other games.

With all the faults, the game is still very enjoyable but I prefer owning Scythe and the upcoming Rising Sun.  Both games have more open information and first time players can easily understand the game far better than Blood Rage's hidden information within the Age decks.

I bought this game, and to my delight, my 27 year old girlfriend loves it as well!  We play mostly 2 player and although it's not as fun as 3+, we still find it very fun and balanced as a 2p game.  The minis are SO fun to paint and admire.  Deliciously frustrating for the loser, and glorious for the winner... and both want a rematch ASAP.  Well worth the $75 CND I paid for it.  

Finally, I altered the clan sheets (very good quality card stock).  Using some tin snips and some metal ducting material ($7 at a home reno chain), I cut squares slightly smaller than the clan sheets, and taped them securely to the back.  Now we use magnetic (custom made from simple magnets from a dollar store) markers to track current rage, starting rage, glory/battle, and units on the clan sheets.  No more "accidentally" moving the stock cardboard pieces by bumping the table :D

Strongly recommended overall!

Very polarizing game for me. In the end, the lack of balance, abusive combos, and forced policing keeps it from being great. 

Pros:
-Very strategic and tactical with experienced players
-Drafting mechanic
-Viking Theme and artwork
-Miniatures quality
-Asymmetry through upgrades

Cons:
-Can be lengthy with 4 players
-Play Investment (Need many plays with experienced players for maximum enjoyment)
-Some strategies are stronger than others (Ship-loop/Loki)

As a result of both of these, it felt like that even though we were interacting and fighting on the board, I had little impact on what others could do because our goals could be entirely different--for a game about warfare, it felt strangely solitaire-ish, and I don't know how I could have done much better. 

There are lots of potential ways to score (it can potentially get a bit point salad-y), but the gameplay is simple, straightforward, and it does feel nice pulling off a good combo and getting a slew of points.  

The minis are very nice, but the difference between the leader and the regular warriors was not big enough.

Certainly not a bad game, and I can see how some of my complaints would lessen with repeated plays, but while I enjoyed my play well enough it's not my cup of tea.

Good with four and five players (with the 5p expansion). My guess is that it isn't as good with three players, wouldn't try with two.

With newbie players, there's a chance a player might get a unbeatable combo (= Loki) running, when others do not counter draft the combo pieces. I don't mind that.

About 2/3 of the game is in the draft and the rest is in the execution of your chosen plan. Every victory I have seen so far has been achieved by abusing a 2 or 3 card combo (there are plenty of combos available).

I wish they would release a expansion that would completely replace all the three decks. The current expansions are overpriced.

Very good game, barely no luck involved. And those miniatures are so beautifully done. Maybe those figures could have been different colors with each faction, but that is only my opinion.

Ultimately, this is a glorified card drafting game with combat thrown in. I was hesitant to pick this one up, because I thought it would be more of a miniatures game than a solid board game. Man, am I glad I finally caved. This game is AWESOME! The drafting is fun and grueling, the combat is straightforward yet exciting and the game has that epic feel. The components are a huge selling point, and they are awesome too. But, make no mistake, this is no miniatures game masquerading as a euro-hybrid. This is a euro-hybrid made even better with awesome components.

*Plays great with 2.

Update 4/23/16:

Moved up to a "10" after 3 plays. This game is SOOO much fun and so tense, and that's with only 2 players!

Excellent theme, and the drafting in this game is probably my favorite feature of the game, it's small, but yet so important and exciting. However, i don't really care for area majority games, and blood rage sends the Analysis Paralysis into overdrive, way worse than Five Tribes does. Blood Rage is a good game, but every decision is mentally exhausting, and this game can overstay its welcome, sometimes cutting it close to three hours.

Not a bad game by any stretch, but felt a lot emptier, less thematic, and mechanically dry than I expected. The lavish production doesn't add anything and the gameplay feels like it would suit wooden pieces better than plastic.

I enjoyed the drafting and powerful card combos, and while I appreciate the smooth game flow, play length and simple-enough mechanics, it felt like the design had been streamlined to the point that the 'soul' of the game has been polished right out of it. At no point did I feel like I was raging, pillaging, fighting, or dying for glory, just manipulating the game state to get points.

Comparisons to Chaos in the Old World are accurate on a mechanical level (power points, turn structure etc) but this doesn't have the thematic richness, nor does it involve me as much in the gameplay.

I really want to love this game... I do. The miniatures are fantastic, the theme is great, and the mechanics are straight-forward and easy to learn.

There's a fundamental issue with this game, however, I noticed it during a playthrough and haven't revisited the game since. I found that it's way too easy for one player to become overpowered, early on. I can't pinpoint HOW, exactly, but it might have to do with certain players being able to leave all their pawns on the board in between rounds, while the other players have to use action points to move theirs back on at the start of each round.

I don't know... after one round I got into an argument with my brother about it, and we ended up TALKING about the game/rules longer than we ended up PLAYING the goddamn game! I'd like to revisit it, but there's other stuff that I already KNOW I'll enjoy playing... and at the end of the day that's what makes for a good game.

Really good game, but not great and not even close to chaos in the old world.  If it were inherently balanced then this would be another story but it relies too much on players having equal knowledge of the game and card combos in order to draft the cards as intended. In fact the game relies on this to balance the card randomness - which is something I don't like with a game with as many mechanisms (fine in 7 wonders).   Also feels like the last player in round one is disadvantaged in which starting spot they choose.

A combination of kemet tech upgrades and chaos in the old world style mana track.  A lot of fun.  Great minis and fantastic art.  Expensive price tag to match. Had an issue with brown vs maroon red and blue vs purple and orange vs green on character bases - hard to distinguish for red/green colour blindness.

RATING: 10
Amazing in every aspect. Interesting use of card drafting. Has area control, direct conflict and hand management elements. Allows you to plan somewhat ahead, though requires you to adapt to the state of the board and to the draft. Luck plays a part on it, but is not central to the gameplay. Gorgeous minis. Over-the-top combos. Allows very different playstyles and strategies to win. Everything seems overpowered, which means nothing really is. Experienced players are very likely to win against new players.

Good: 
The game has many different mechanics that work well together such as card drafting, unit selection, and area control. 

There are many ways to earn victory points so you don't need to stick with a single strategy type. The mechanics mentioned above will be used to help form your strategy. 

CMON quality minis and components. 

Bad: 
The game doesn't have heavy rules but if you don't understand what you are drafting and formulate strategies off of your draft you will get trampled upon. There were a few newer players that decided the game wasn't fun because of this. 

(related to drafts) As new players to the game it is extremely difficulty trying to overcome the Loki (points for dying) strategy. For the games we have played it feels like the most effective way to win.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Absolutely love this game.  Will not go into too much detail about gameplay, but essentially the game consists of two phases.  In the first you draft cards from the given round's deck, taking a card and then passing the rest to the next player, who in turn is doing the same.  In the next phase you take turns playing your cards, placing your army, and doing battle over the different regions of the board in order to gain rewards and further develop your clan.  Rinse, repeat.  As things progress you get more powerful cards, the game board becomes smaller as regions are destroyed, and more battles inevitably occur.  There are multiple paths to victory, so the most powerful army is not always the winner.  

Pros: 1) Easy to learn, but lots of strategy.  2) Quick gameplay, yet still deep and rewarding.  3) Contents are high quality.  Great sculpts.  4) It's very FUN!  (Isn't that what's most important?).

The game that caused the popularity explosion for Vikings as a board game theme, it's an interesting combination of an area control game and a miniatures combat game that is easy to learn but offers a pretty deep level of strategy.

Was super excited about the game but after spending the last month seeing post by all the people that got the game before kickstarter backers I'm furious... Blood Rage is correct. 

I'm fine with making a game available to the public around the same time as the backers but for the backers to have to wait months later than retail is #@! 

This will be my last CMON kickstarter...

Update- 3 months after it was made available for purchase to non backers... It has finally arrived!

Played twice now but my group isn't loving it... It's the curse of CMON! Games look great but my group never wants to play them more than once!

Played 3 times so far but it seems a solid game. Multiple possible strategies, randomness is nicely constrained, you can win by getting beaten which is quite fun. Rules seem to be unclear at times though. Miniatures of monsters are great, infantry not so great but not bad. Quality of the board and player boards is not great but so much plastic for this price is great anyway.

The rule book is very poorly written and unclear.

I typically don't care for area control games, but I really liked this one.  I think that losing a battle isn't the end of the world, and can even by beneficial helps.

Oh man, my favorite game in 2016. At some point, I started veering off from euros into more ameritrash titles (especially hybrids). 

Blood Rage is excellent fun. Turns move fast, drafting keeps all the cards balanced, and a light tactical area-of-control element. The presentation is wonderful as well (all painted minis).

I haven't tired of this title just yet, but I could see maybe after 20 plays, when all the discovery has been mined, that it might not be as fun.

Until then, LET'S PLAY!

Plays a bit like Nexus Ops, in that there is simple combat rules, an emphasis on action, some cards to score points, a central area everyone fights over, different units and upgrades...  The plastic figures are really unnecessary, and maybe i would be interested if the price was 30 Eur with cardboard chits.  Not deep at all, but plays relatively quickly except for the card drafting, which slows things down considerably.  How about just deal the cards and make the best of what you have got?

The mechanics of Blood Rage are quite interesting and I usually quite enjoy the game when I play it. But after 5 plays (all 4 player games), I find that I tend to leave the table unsatisfied and frustrated. 

I think the main issue I have is that there are too few cards - I've seen them all, and they fall a bit too neatly in a few synergistic groups. I think that adding more cards to the total pool (but keeping the number of cards players keep) would really make the game more interesting to me, as you would not know exactly which cards are in play - and there would be a greater chance of "new" strategies appearing, rather than different people picking from the 3-4 existing paths every game.

Then again, I've found myself often thinking "Huh, maybe it's time to give blood rage another go...?".

Every stretch goal (including Gods of Asgard), the 5th Player Expansion, and everything that shipped with this KS is packed snugly in the main Blood Rage box. 

There is some bending on some of the minis weapons, two of the small cards are bent but perfectly functional. Again, it is packed in tightly and ships as a single box without the add-on boxes--(not the way a chroming gamer would ever do it, but it all fits). 

The game has been played four times. 

I'm looking exclusively for Imperial Assault add-ons/expansions, Arcadia Quest KS Edition, Star Wars Rebellion, or the Queen's Gambit.

Pleasantly surprised. I had high hopes based on the drafting and multiple ways of generating points aside from winning combats and those expectations were met. I wonder how fresh it can stay without injecting more cards but I would definitely play again.

RATING: 4
The only good thing it's the duration other than that it's a bad ameritrash. Cards that can turn the table and no way to do a decent strategy.
If it weren't for the figures and the kickstarter it would be a really mediocre game for the most people.

So a bad bad game with nothing to show other than what we have already sheen.

I want to like this game, I really do.  However, I feel like it has a learning curve of several games due to the draft and I've really struggled to get it to the table enough with people who already know it or are willing to suffer through a few learning games to reach the point where it shines.

Update: As expected, my view on this game has increased as I've played it more and played with a few more experienced people.  I would really like to play it with all experienced people however.

RATING: 6
My feeling is just...meh.  This game was totally overhyped.  Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't expected so much.  The minis were pretty great looking, but I was unimpressed by most of the other components for the price.  The game and player boards just felt cheap, and I was not that into the artwork.  

Besides that, it wasn't horrible, just not my kind of game.  I had heard that there were a lot of euro-y mechanisms but between the draft and the battle it felt little more than glorified rock-paper-scissors.  This might improve with play and knowledge of the other cards in the game, the varying strategies.  But I just didn't find it that interesting.  I have a love-hate relationship with area control games.  I often don't mind games with some majority bonuses, a very typical euro-type scoring, but games that rely heavily on area control, descendants of El Grande, have never been my favorites.

I would play it again, and I think I could enjoy it a little more, having better expectations going in.  But overall, I just didn't feel the game stood out like I hoped it would, after so many rave reviews.

AMZING component quality, the Minis are just fantastic, no words to describe them! It's an eye catcher and everyone that passes by comes and picks them up!

The game is simple enough, it might be a bit overwhelming at start when you get 8 cards in your hand to choose one but you quickly understand how things work and the flow of the game is pretty fast and quick, I don't think there's much chance of AP (except during the draft) because you pretty much know what you want to accomplish and what you have to do to get it and only if someone screws badly with your plans before your turn you won't know what you want to do.

I'm very glad I got this one, it's an excellent excellent game!

RATING: 9.9
I backed this one a while ago and it arrived in good order not too soon after it was due (delivered in October with a September projected delivery time); for a KickStarter that’s practically an early delivery. Mrs Fish liked the look of the large packing box (yes, I went all-in for the 5th as well) and decided it would make a dandy Xmas gift for her husbandman. Which it did.

Anyway, over the Xmas break I unboxed the goodies (much to the delight of the Little Fish), read the rules and got pretty excited about the game. From what I could see it was everything that I hoped, add on excellent production values including some superb miniature sculpting and I was keen as keen could be to get it onto the table of honour.

Fortunately, it was pretty easy to find other interested parties and I managed to get in a couple of games at a local games meet-up the first with the base set and the second with both the Blood Rage: Mystics of Midgard and Blood Rage: Gods of Ásgard expansions (discussed below). I also took it along to Cancon and taught it to three new players which was good.

The base game itself is a pretty good game, very engaging and one that has a lot of challenging decisions. Starting the round with card drafting is interesting as it gives a player a chance to ‘read’ the play for the next Age and work out what one’s opponents are up to as well as working out what they need to do. Building a decent ‘engine’ is also rewarded as having complimentary abilities on all your cards is very important. These are skills that will come with experience and should add a lot to the replayability of the game.

The game encourages bold play and there are plenty of ways to score point so that a bad round does not necessarily put a player out of contention. So, in short, a winner a keeper and one game I’d like to play again and again.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.3
A nice accessible game with great components.  The card draft gives each round a unique feel and presumably increases variety from game to game.  The actual turn structure feels both tactical and strategic.  You have an idea of what you want to accomplish for the whole round and each turn presents you with a nice amount of gaming tension as you try to determine actions that will allow you to achieve your overall goal.  It works really, really well.

Eric M. lang + cool mini or not + Vikinger Szenario = Da kann doch eigentlich nix schiefgehen oder?! Genau so ist es! Blood Rage liefert ein fantastisches Spielmaterial, die Minis sehen großartig aus. Das Vikingerszenario wirkt passend und stimmig und liefert einige sehr coole Mechaniken, z.B. das tote Einheiten nach Valhalla gehen und ggf noch Siegpunkte bringen. Die Regeln sind für so ein Spiel erfreulich einfach und einsteigerfreundlich. Trotzdem zeigt sich beim spielen ein strategischer und spannender Kampf um die einzelnen Gebiete (Area-Control) und einen mehr als gelungenen Drafting-Mechanismus gibt es auch! Sehr zu empfehlen!

Puntos fuertes: Miniaturas con mucho detalle. Mecánica de draft bien implementada.  Arte muy cuidado, original. Muy bien tematizado.

Puntos débiles: La calidad de los tableros individuales es muy mejorable (cartulina fina). Las miniaturas pequeñas al ser de plástico vienen algunas dobladas. Demasiado despliegue para la duración de la partida a dos, al menos.

Conclusión: Buen euro disfrazado de Ameri-trash. Juego muy bien ambientado de mecánica simple. Para un público iniciado en los juegos, pero quizá algo corto para jugones. Hemos de reconocer que aquí tenemos opiniones encontradas. Pep cree que es un juegazo y Nany que ni fu ni fa.

Love the theme. I don't like how lucky you have to be to get a monster in the draft (they get drafted immediately, so if it's not in your first stack then you're out of luck). I also don't see how a Thor or Odin-based strategy would work; Tyr and Loki seem to be the best battle cards. FYI there's this one card that my group has found to be OP (it lets you invade with an additional warrior for free). We've removed it (and have to playtest more), but so far we're enjoying the game more.

Great minis.  I like how each player has a different objective based on drafting so it leads to some unique situations as everyone has their own agenda.

My first foray into both area control and card drafting. The game is a lot of fun and, despite the glutton of minis, is actually fairly straight-forward and easy to teach. New players might not fare well compared to those more experienced with the different paths to victory; however the game manages to be fun enough to mitigate the discrepancy in scores at the end of the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is one of those odd games where the discongruencies between the mechanics and theme bother me. It also feels possible that there are a few cards that one should build an engine around, so if you draw those cards, draft them, and can build those engines, you will be competitive, and if you don't draw those cards, you probably won't be. (Hopefully, the number of competitive engines is at least the number of players in the game.)

I've cooled on Blood Rage a bit since its release. It's still one of the best quick and dirty conflict games out there, but I'm starting to feel like each game is a little samey. Luckily expansions have given this game a little variety, but this isn't one I'm always apt to pull off the shelf. Surprisingly, however, this has outlasted other card-drafting and area control games in my collection. Between the quick play time and the fantastic production, it's difficult not to appreciate Blood Rage for what it is.

This is really your standard CMoN joint: incredible minis (by Studio McVey) and so-so gameplay, overhyped due to the former and the kickstarter perception distortion field.

RATING: 7
Blood Rage thoughts after one game (second place 141 points to 90 points to 80 points and 171 points). Hmm. Felt like one person ran away a smidge. But still fun I think trying to catch up and use a Loki strategy. Not sure the replay after seeing all the cards a few times but like the different monsters, miniatures, leaders, upgrades, and Battle cards for variety, and I think it felt more refreshing than remet. May be good to have for the variety despite runaway leader? Valhalla and quest points isn't enough probably....? Or maybe it is if you become good enough. Storage seems reasonable if you don't mind damaging figures a bit - not big deal prob. Catch-up is nice since you keep cards when you lose and usually get points for dying or being in Valhalla various ways. Won't always get Loki cards so some tension whether you win or not but if you don't get them opponents are more likely to wanna lose. Interesting balance of strategues and likely some cool hybrid strategies. Kind if like a more refined and slightly faster Chaos in Old World with symmetric starts but quick asymmetry arising like in kemet. Theme eh but not horrible - just dislike the dying but miniatures do look really cool. Overall liked it a lot and felt like good interaction and pretty climactic enough battles. Downtime low because one action but one person can get a lot of rage and leap ahead in action...not sure how I feel but overall didn't mind THAT much...assuming they play quicker which they will.balance seems good with draft and lots of memorizing or strategizing against others cards.

Dudes. On. A. Map.
Y.A.W.N.

It's a random battle "game". Guess what the opponents might do, guess if you have the right cards to win. Guess if you want to win.

I don't get it. Drafting the cards seems as arbitrary as just being dealt a hand.

A masterpiece of strategy, would have get a 10, but i'm not absolutely sure about the balancing. It's also hard for a beginner vs experienced players. Despite that a perfect theme with amazing miniatures and a very good drafting system combined with area-control. Also no diplomatic parts, pure stategic placement and bashing.

This game combines euro complexity with Amerithrash action. It is inspired by the monster and variable powers of "Kemet" and "Cyclades", and places extra emphasis on area control and points management. Amazing look, theme, and overall quality of gameplay. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.2
Solid, well-balanced game with simple rules but nonetheless complex interactions. Very different experience whether going for a 2-player or 4-player game. The theme is great, and you really feel like a pillaging mob going berserk until the end of times. The difference in scoring can be significant and not knowing the cards is a big disadvantage though; therefore, you may want to give good advice to new players and educate them on the implications of their actions... otherwise, they may easily get brutalized, leaving them with a bitter aftertaste.

RATING: 8
From its components I worried that Blood Rage was just going to be another Kemet, (which I despise). Not so!

BR's smart integration of its Norse theme creates a balance in strategy from each card reflecting the personality of God bestowing the Gift. Some give brute force, some are crafty, some favor the underdog. BR's philosophy of honor through death constantly clears sections of the board and relieves the calcified territorial battling that occurs in other area majority games.

The worst thing I can say about BR is I detest its Kickstarter funding. Having discovered the game late there is pretty much no way I'll ever get my hands on the KS Stretch rewards which makes it feel like I'll never get to experience the full game.

Oh, and I think the name is dumb. Blood Rage doesn't conjure to mind a viking game. It's predecessor, Midgard, was a better title.

Absolutely love it. I'm so sad I backed out of Kickstarting it. I want all that extra stuff. The game looks likes it would be all dice rolling and brainless attacking, but it isn't.

RATING: 7
A very nice dudes-on-a-map game.  Gets the job done quickly, encourages strategic thinking and tactical flexibility.  Well done, Eric.  So why the 7?  Because without the gewgaws of the admittedly beautiful miniatures, it's an average weight dudes-on-a-map game.  And this leads me to a bigger issue...

This game is being lauded by reviewers who received their $100+ game as a freebie.  I'm glad that these people appreciate this game and are taken in by its design, both as a game and as an object.  But these people are influencers, and these people are conveniently forgetting that for us mortals, us people who don't get free games on demand, we have to pay $100+ for a game that could have been distributed for ($20-60) without the bullshit.

This game is a 10 at $50, and a 7 at $100. I am clearly not CMON's target audience -- it's that simple.

It's Chaos in the Old World with less asymmetry and no dice. I like the asymmetry in CitOW, but not the dice; so I like this one! It has aspects of area control but with simultaneous-reveal battle cards, which seems to be the rage (no pun intended) these days; I like that too, although I'd prefer if the army strength mattered just a tiny bit more.

Monsters seem very powerful on the board - perhaps overly so? But dominating on the board is not a sure path to victory. I'd like to play more.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.7
All the production stuff has excellent quality: illustrations, minis, graphic design, cardboard...

It's the best blend between eurogames and tactical ameritrash I've seen lately. It's clearly superior to Chaos In The Old World, as many people claim. The draft mechanism is key, but so is the order of your actions, and adapting to what other players deploy and do on the board... It manages to create tension and maintain it.

On top of that, the gameplay is quite fluid and and it has an good game lenght of around 90 minutes.

Not everything is perfect in Blood Rage, though:
-> Runaway leaders (and players with no hope of catching up) will happen often
-> Some cards seem overpowered :-/
-> Some cards interactions are not covered in the rulebook
-> Not enough cards of each era to reinforce replayability.

Overall, it's a very interesting mix of american and euro games. Able to produce both great and dull games.

Grandissima e inaspettata scoperta. Gioco con miniature bellissime che gridano di essere colorate. Si rivela anche un gioco strategicamente molto interessante. Si parte con un draft iniziale per poi giocare tre turni carichi di pianificazione ma anche di botte da orbi. Gioco di maggioranze territoriali dove la mano di carte conservate fa la differenza, spesso anche le sconfitte portano a piacevoli risultati in termini di punti vittoria. Gioco interessante che strizza l'occhio a Caos nel Vecchio Mondo e a Lord of the Ice Garden. Esistono anche diverse espansioni che rendono il gioco più longevo e variabile.

Well, that was underwhelming. Some nice features, for sure, particularly the constricted area control. But the cards are really, really swingy, and the draft (virtually a cliche these days) does nothing to dispel this. The minis are gamer-crack of the most blatant kind.

Despite it being a short game, I was bored well before the end.

[English] Don't be fooled by the most fantastic miniatures of board gaming history. Blood Rage is the ultimate Eurotrasher. This game has got the best from both worlds: A cool viking ameritrashy theme with a whole lotta euro mechanics. This game integrates my three favorite mechanics of board gaming of all time (Draft, Variable Player Powers, and Area Control) in a majestic way. The main downside of this game would probably be that does not scale well (it is not very good with 2 players). Besides that, a fantastic experience.

So have gotten the chance to play a 4 way game of Blood rage. I love the theme and story of the game it is great. The components are top of the line. Overall I think the game was very well done and fun. My one comment that is some what negative I guess would be that I wish there was more to do during our turns. I understand you have to make important choices on what you spend your rage on but I felt like that was not enough to do. I dont know if that makes sense or not.

I love it. However, some imbalances in the core game based on very strong combos that - if they happen to end up in the hands of a player which cannot always be prevented by the others even given the draft system - can pretty break individual games. It's still fun to lose the game even in these situations, which is a pretty good tell for a great game.

Despite the amazing artwork and fantastic miniatures, make no mistake: This is a Eurogame through and through, not a thematic wargame of any sort, despite appearances. As a matter of fact, the primary mechanics at work here are rather dry card-drafting, area-control, and action-point allocation.

Whether you like these kinds of Eurogames or not, it is hard to appreciate a game that more often than not has wildly differing scores at the disappointingly anticlimactic end; the winning player commonly ends the game with around 100 points more than the person in second place, with players in the middle of the pack rarely ending with scores even within 25 points of each other. Needless to say, almost every player I have shared this game with came away disheartened and frustrated.

Obviously, this game has now been sold.

RATING: 7
Euro-AT-hybrid with a clear overweight of the Euro side. With 3 players, too deterministic for me. Way too Euro-ish for me. I want more randomness. For example, I'd love to roll dice for combat and would still prefer CitoW over BR any time for that single reason. Dislike that stupid drafting mechanism, hate it when it all comes down to victory points. Nothing is more boring than a calculated victory by having the most victory points! 

You see, Blood Rage does not only visually appeal to your fellow viking metal maniac. Blood Rage is the game incarnation of that type of person with a hair cut and a beard like a viking, drinking met out of a bull horn while wearing a grim Northern Folk-Viking-Whatever-Metal shirt. But that guy enjoys tax declaraion as a hobby and washes his Mercedes on Sunday.

Still, BR is a very much okay game. Also a very good looking one.

[COLOR=#FF0000]A year later... thoughts and rating (6/8 -> 4)[/COLOR]

[i]I had reservations about Blood Rage and they ended up being right. We played a few more times and I just didn't find the game fun. It really is as simple as that, Blood Rage is my least favorite dudes on a map game I've played to date. I normally love drafting in games, but not in Blood Rage. I didn't find the different god cards you draft to be that interesting; most of the synergies were very clear cut and didn't require much thought to execute. Combat resolution was okay, but I much prefer the card based system Kemet employed versus this one. Blood Rage failed to connect all the different mechanisms into a cohesive game play experience. 

I know I am in the minority, but I really don't get the hype surrounding Blood Rage. Is it really the minis? Either way, Blood Rage is a game I'll be avoiding in the future.[/i]

[COLOR=#FF0000]Initial thoughts and rating (8):[/COLOR]

[i]- Battle resolution is great, you know the strength of each unit but being able to play a card adds uncertainty to the outcome of the battles and adds to the strategy of deciding when to pillage. 
- Relatively quick to set up for this type of game (my biggest gripe with Kemet).
- Not sure how fun the game is with three, I think it may need four to be more competitive, but I'm only two plays in so this may change.
- Mini's are nice, but the warriors all suffer from droopy weapons. Personally I find the mini's from Kemet to be far superior, even the smaller warriors.
- The other components are lackluster, thin player boards, tiny cards and bland board artwork.

I'm not sure where I stand with this game yet, I definitely need and want to play it more. I've played two 3p games with my kids and both have been absolute blow outs. I know part of this is just learning the cards and combos in the game, but I also feel like three players may not be the best player count. I can't even imagine playing with two. I also keep thinking that we are playing things wrong, but I think we got most things nailed down for the second game. It would be nice if the supposed FAQ they are working on would get released. 

As it stands my kids are having fun so it'll continue to get played, but I'm not sure if it'll remain in our collection in the long term. Of course I could also see us really enjoying the game a lot more once we understand the nuances of the game play. Right now if I had to choose I still prefer Kemet, but this game is much easier to set up and teach. I guess time will tell.[/i]

Incredibly fun game, borrowing the basic framework of Lang's earlier Chaos in the Old World, which I like a bit better. The card drafting is a great addition here, as is the incorporation of the Loki 'lose to win' strategy. But I find those twists to the basic area control gameplay is less nuanced than those in Chaos, and I prefer those nuances.

規則:
*主圖板跟其餘圖板放置，放一個綠色邊緣的掠奪標記在中央世界樹獎勵面朝上，其餘隨機開著放在其他八個省份，8個滅世標記隨機三個文字面放在時間版圖對應位置上，把末世標記放在該回合的滅世標記指定省分。2/3/4人時隨機拿3/2/1個滅世標記放在其對應省分上，該省分遊戲不使用，根據人數移除對應卡牌再根據牌背洗勻放在時間版圖對應位置上，世界標記紀錄回合

*遊戲進行三輪，每輪有六個階段，利用時間板塊紀錄
1..輪抽階段 之前輪的手牌先放著，然後發這時代的手牌每人8張(第一場遊戲第一輪可不輪抽)，輪抽每次留一張，值到保留6張，剩下的棄掉(2人時一次選兩張)
2.行動階段 怒氣值移到起始格(能力可能讓你增加)，由起始開始輪流動作，需要支付怒氣的就支付，怒氣到0的玩家自動pass，選擇pass的玩家怒氣也自動歸0，在所有人pass或是所有未被毀滅的省分被成功掠奪後，行動階段結束
>侵略  支付等於單位力量的怒氣值放單位到任意外部省分(中間不行)的空村莊上，船要放港灣，放領袖不花怒氣，場上單位數上限等於你圖版的號角數
>移動 花一怒氣移動一個省分(港灣不行)所以村莊的單位到另一個省分的其他空村莊上(包括中間，中間沒單位限制)

a.從你左手玩家開始，輪流可選擇移動一個相鄰此省分的單位到此省分的空村莊上(不花怒氣，pass玩家也可以做，船不行)，直到滿或每人要進來，如果沒有其他單位跟船在此你直接掠奪成功，直接獲得獎勵將掠奪板塊翻面，但沒有分數
b.出卡牌 每個有單位在此的人暗出一張卡(除非沒牌)，一起打開，只有戰鬥卡增加戰鬥力跟效果，每個人把其單位戰鬥力總和(包括卡牌，沒單位也會算卡牌)
c.結算 戰鬥力最高獲勝，平手都算輸，輸的卡牌都收回手贏的棄掉，輸的人移動所有單位到valhalla圖板，發動掠奪的如果獲勝可拿掠奪獎勵並翻面，如果輸就沒事，然後戰鬥勝利的獲得其個人圖板斧頭值得分數
*一個港灣相鄰兩個省份
3.棄牌階段 棄到剩一張，最後一的時期全棄
4.任務階段 打開任務卡，如果完成條件就拿獎勵，比力量的平手算失敗，會加總相鄰港灣的船
5.諸神黃昏階段 拿此回合對應的滅世標記放到對應省分，毀滅面朝上，所有該省分單位跟相鄰港灣船都移動到VALHALLA圖板，並根據時間圖版的獎勵拿分(2/3/4分在1/2/3時代)，然後移動末世標記到下個要毀滅的省份
6.所以在valhalla版圖的模型回手，所有掠奪標記翻回獎勵面，起始玩家左傳，回合標記下左移
*遊戲在三個時代後結束，加總個人圖板的三個能力額外加分(4/5格+10，最後一格+20)，分數最高獲勝

This game flopped pretty hard when my group tried it. By the mid-way point, the winners and losers were already a foregone conclusion, with no real catch-up mechanism available. A few of the cards are overpowered, and the game seems to reward those who purposely lose all their battles — hardly a fun way of playing an area control game.

Another Kickstarter game I'm kicking myself for not backing. In my defense, this is typically not My Game; it looks conflict-heavy, dungeon-crawly, plus it had miniatures. But oh my god, this is a really good game! Blood Rage has many elements I love in classic Euros: a great Norse mythology theme, card drafting, multiple "tracks" for resources and victory points as the game's deciding factor for a winner. The game's turns are fast and easy to understand; most of your time in the game will be spent deciding whether you should join battles when another player "pillages" an adjacent territory. Blood Rage is a terrific entryway game for people who want a bit more theme and interactivity than a typical Euro. But the game is also great for veteran players because it has a great foundation of solid mechanics and flawless gameplay. Definitely a recommend for everyone! Now on to painting those miniatures!

A nice re-implementation of Midgard. Doing away with all the placement cards turns the game even further from area majority (the bane of fun), and into a game where you're just slamming guys on to enjoin battle in various areas. Battles are won and lost on the cards you play (gained 7 Wonders style at the start of the round). The really nice thing is you can do well in the game by losing all your battles, as there are oodles of ways to gain points when you lose. It's a matter of building a strategy with your card draw, and flowing with it. I'd happily play it again, but I'm not sure continual conflict games have enough in them to keep pulling me back. Entertaining more than engaging.

This game has area control, collapsing territories, card play and upgrades....many good elements. The area control works well and is limited by the zones in a area (once all the zones are filled up, no more units can enter). Territories are destroyed by the Ragnarok in each of the 3 ages; this really tightens up the board and forces players/forces to interact. There are many upgrades, so I can see each game being different. You can upgrade leaders, ships, units, clans, monsters, etc. What you can do on a turn is limited by the amount of Rage you have (which you can upgrade as well). 

One of the most visually stunning parts of the game are the HUGE monster minis. There are 4 included and any player can get them (by spending Rage). 

Overall this is a really fun game. Combat is different, as you only fight if one clan pillages a territory but that's not a bad thing.

After first try: 
Played with two experienced players and another beginner. Didn't get to do much first era due to not knowing what cards I had never seen could do. The most experienced player won 100p before the rest of us that got around 90p. 

I can't really understand the high ranking of this game. I has quite unbalanced cards, fairly simple mechanics and thus little variation and it's ugly. 

I'll give it a moderate rating and hope that next time will be a better experience.

Fantastic production value. The game takes the card drafting mechanic from "Fairy Tale" and builds a viking game around it.
It is a lot of fun but playing time was abysmal.
Have to play it again, holefully without investing 3 hours again.

Based on one play: The board is fairly simple, place your characters and fight to gain upgrades on your player board, but where the fun really occurs is the card drafting and timing of playing your actions as you move onto the board, pillage, fight and gain points. The game we played had one player way ahead as he gained points from losing battles, but with more plays I am sure strategies like this will get blocked. The simple mechanics but significant interactions are a great mix.

I liked the fighting and theme. I wish the board would have had more spaces, but it still worked pretty well. There was a bit of VP salad, and I actually won solely from 1 card, going from last place to sweeping far in front of everyone else because of one card that just gave me so many VPs at the end. One thing that I really disliked, though, was how the combat worked out. Basically, if you had more strength, you completely wiped out the opponents and kept all your pieces--I think it would have been better if you stil lost some troops in combat.

Blood Rage is a game in which players create armies and try to take part in glorious battles before the impending Ragnarok ends the world.  In each of the game's three rounds, players first draft a number of cards that provide special abilities, give them access to new units, grant victory points for certain end-of-round conditions, or help them fight battles.  Players then use their limited resources to deploy their units and fight over the various territories, earning points for the battle and bumps on tracks providing income, increases in the unit cap, and increases in battle rewards.  At the end of each round, a pre-determined region is destroyed by Ragnarok, and units left in that region are killed but earn bonus victory points.  While this seems fairly straightforward, a number of upgrade cards provide "perverse" incentives for losing battles, having your own units killed, etc.  I'm a little concerned that such cards may be overpowered in comparison to normal strategies.  Also, I found it was too easy to "camp" regions, as if a region is full of a single player's units, it's almost impossible to dislodge him.  Despite these misgivings, I found this to be a thoroughly enjoyable game, with a wide variety of interesting strategies and gameplay.

Basically a viking retheme of Chaos in the Old World. Just now with 100% more drafting!

There is a lot to like in this, but I often found that this game feels pretty one dimensional. It's like they took Chaos, stripped out most of its soul just to have it artificially re-injected with drafting. The theme is cool, the minis are nice, but I'm not itching to get it to the table. We've also had weird runaway leaders in this one, too. It seems like 1 person is always really far ahead a few people in the middle of that and one person in DEAD last...like not even close.

Extras: Includes all the kickstarter exclusive content, Gods of Asgard, Mystics of Midgard, the 5th player content, plastic tokens, FFG sleeves, etc.

Oustanding. One of the best game I have. Easy to learn, easy to play, lots of possibility (even more with the extension). Love the figurine, and a big fight with all the monster at Yggdrasil. Even non fighter player of mine like to play because winning a battle is not winning the game.

This is one of those games that can make me laugh while playing it because it is just so much fun. I love the simple card combat with the simultaneous selection and reveal. While one on one fights are good, the way everyone who is in the contested spot gets to (has to) join in the battle - that's where it can be really surprising. All the different upgrades, the drafting every round, the tricky Loki cards, the myriad ways to score points and build a strategy - that's why I love this game.

Really like this game, but need to get more plays in before I can give it a good, solid rating.  I can say it is one of my favorites, and instantly goes into my Top 10.  I have only played it with two players, but will get a chance to play with more soon.  Then I feel I can give a more accurate rating.  It may seem silly to hold back a rating after putting it in my Top 10, but I am slightly OCD and want to be as accurate as possible. I know it is a favorite, just not sure where it stands on a 1 to 10 scale yet.

A visually deceptive game in many respects; You could easily dismiss this game as a miniature show piece, 'heavy metal' style visuals with no real gameplay depth, but is quite the opposite. A drafting game with area control which makes each decision carry a lot of weight. A very tactical and Euro style game which is great fun and doesn't outstay it's welcome. Delighted I picked it up (+ expansions too).

RATING: 9
The buzz about this game will linger in the air for a long time.  Another winner by Eric Lang and certainly the game that made him a household name among board game efficionados.  Blood Rage uses a number of mechanics from card drafting, to area control to card driven combat.  You are vikings fighting for glory before the land erupts in fire and all ends in Valhalla.  But their are many strategies you can employ to gain glory.  Will you be strong in battle?, will you go after quests, or will you submit to your enemy and get glory by dying.  How you play is determined by you and the cards you draft.  Everyone I have played with has LOVED this game.  The artwork is good .. not stellar, but the miniatures are some of the best you will find in any game period!  You have a clan of warriors and a leader but can draft monsters and ships to aid in your quest for glory.  Wow..just wow

(3 plays) A quick an brutal death romp.  The factions become unique through a random card drafting mechanism that make for a huge variety of faction combinations.  The card play in battle can be heartbreaking, with lots of cancel cards and spoilers.  It's a fast and easy game to play, so that's OK.

RATING: 6
Haven't played it yet, but it's on the way to my house.  Based off of the mechanics alone this is an automatic 8 in my book, the question is whether or not this will jump to a 9 or 10 after a few playthroughs.

Finally got to play the game and I think I'm going to leave it at an 8 for now and possibly move it up to a 9 in the future.  After about 3 games I've seen 1 issue with this game, and that is lack of unique strategies.  I have not played the game with the two expansion packs but I've heard that they do not add a ton to the game.  What it needs is about 3-4 more cards per god per age, also the powers need to feel actually different and unique rather than stronger versions of previous ages.  But the game is great and my nitpicking is nothing that an expansion couldn't fix.

Blood Rage has definitely gotten stale for me, I moved this one down to a 6.  I honestly have not opened up the expansions for this one yet, but I don't see them adding that much variety to this game.  It's a cool looking game, and is a great gateway game for area control noobies.  But there is not enough depth in this game to get me to play it a ton, there's not enough variety of strategy and you are at the mercy of the draft.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
A game that gets better the more you play it. Due to the  card drafting for each age no two games are ever the same. Find a way to demo this game if you are unsure you want to buy it. Highly recommended to play with 4 players. Again, this game only gets better with the Gods of Asgard and the Mystics of Midgard expansions.

Pros:
* Beautifully detailed miniatures.
* Simple to learn but hard to master.
* Well balanced and play tested.

Cons:
* The board's graphic designed is muted and could have been better.
* Various cards are removed with less than 4 players.

This game is a really nice balance of euro and ameritrash. The card effects are very powerful(some might be too powerful) which make the draft very interesting. The actual area control is quite euro, but it manages to be more tense than other games that feature similar types of deterministic combat. And obviously, the components are top notch.

Had some very high expectations of this one, seen the extremely high average rating of 8.2 (03/06/2016), but my one play so far was a sort of a bummer. 
First of all: this is a way overproduced (as the warriors could have been easily replaced with simple cubes like in most majority games) sort of majority game. But my biggest concern is: there seems to a certain number of winning combo-cards and if someone has those, there is simply nothing you can do, apart from waiting until the game is over (which I must admit isn't that long). The only way to solve this problem is to know all those combo's and prevent the creation of such a combo, but that requires a lot of plays of this game off course :s

To end, a sidenote: in the beginning I thought that you could win with a sort of losing-strategy (by the Loki-cards who give you an advantage if you lose) and that would be a cool thing. Then after a full game, I don't think it can compete at all with simply being the strongest one and pillage a province. Simply because pillage improves yours stats, which is a big advantage, as it lets you score even more points by winning a batlle and gives tons of end points at the end of the game as you reached the end of a track.

Edit 12/06/2016: Increased rating after second play as Wim proved you CAN win with a losing strategy. It seems harder, but it's great that you can win by losing :D

RATING: 10
Streamlined accessible hybrid area control with the best minis in a board game I owned. It's easy to pick up by non-boardgamers but also develops several layers of depth as you play it more. I still like Chaos in the Old World better because each god has its unique set of powers and play mode, ergo a personality. In Blood Rage players develop their powers - which is cool - but for me it takes from the immersion. Goes into the pantheon of remarkable area control games.  

Now fully painted.

This game seemed to be getting high praise all around the geek. I definitely wanted to try it out when I had the chance. I heard it was more Euro-y and less Ameritrash. More like Eurotrash? haha I suppose that is accurate. It is a drafting combat game. There are some nice things that are happening. There are some take that aspects which I didn't really enjoy. You can customize this by adapting to getting beaten up which is nice. Different strategies and combos to explore. I liked this game enough where I would play it again. At the moment I am not seeking it out to play again. It was just OK for me. BUT THERE IS THE PLAYER COLOR OF RED AND WOLF COMBO! THAT IS AMAZING!

I would have rated higher if it weren't for the overwhelming amount of or chaos and randomness created by some of the very powerful cards. A card played by an opponent to destroy all your forces in a province can permanently set you behind.

There is way too much fluctuation in a player's standing during the game. In one turn you think you are winning, in the next you are almost out of the game. If a few of the overly powerful cards are removed from play, it may improve the game, but I haven't tried that yet.

But the overall experience CAN BE enjoyable. Just don't take it too seriously and don't lose friends over it!

I am a little bit dissapointed after the first play. It was meant to be quick, but we spent almost 4 hours. It was unclear who the leader is, and the winner was unexpected. Beautiful components - espacially monsters - but the whole game is in my opinion overhyped, not even in the same league with Forbidden Stars or GoT.

[*] So far the game is very enjoyable. I'll give a rating once I get play a little more.

The miniatures are great.

I feel like there is a balancing issue with Loki, because of his cards based on losing and the fact you don't lose your attack cards when you lose so they can be used again and again.

This is a dudes on the map game, where each player has three stats on their player boards, a limited number of action points, and a pool of units. Players then draft cards which will define their strategies and goals for that round. At the end of the round, a region explodes and gets closed off, making each subsequent round tighter. This game is really fascinating as you explore the ways the different cards and strategies interact. It's also great that combat is only through unit strength plus a single card played, meaning it's diceless. This game satisfies the desire for minis combat and has uprising depth.

Kind of a stripped-down Cyclades, removing many of the finicky mechanics (and, admittedly, some of the complexity and depth).  The miniatures are stunning, the battles are tense, and the rules are fairly simple.  Set up is long, long, long, but the game is satisfying enough to justify the effort.  It is undeniably conflict-based, and that can lead to runaway leaders or players that are left in the dust early in the game, but proper strategy can make losing battles almost as VP-lucrative as aggressively dominating the board.  Plays well with five players (but requires an expansion, which irritates me).  
Probably my favorite CMON game.
Recommended.

As good as Kemet I guess? But tile "shopping" is replaced by cards drafting at the start of every age to form your main strategy.

Unlike Kemet where battles can be initiated just by invading, BR battles are only initiated if someone pillages a province and neighbouring opponents wish to stop the pillage, provided there's empty spots for them to enter the province or they are already in that province.

Very awesome looking miniatures as well and a clever way to differentiate the leader among the warriors.

Only one play, but I disliked how drafting determined your hand, as well as the feeling you get when you lose a battle because someone played a card you never knew existed. Definitely not the game for me, I'd choose Kemet over it in a heartbeat. Might be more fun once you actually know all the available card options, but I doubt I'll ever get to that point.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Only managed one play so far. A bit aggressive and lucky (a lot seems to be determined by the cards you get) which is mitigated to an extent by the drafting (not really). Don't understand why races are not asymmetric, would have thought that was obvious. One of those games where if you've played before, you definitely have an advantage over your opponents. Not because you have a strategy though, but because you know which cards are worth drafting as opposed to others. Probably better confrontational games out there.

Miniatures are cool, but a bit 'cult of the new'.

It's a bit derivative and there's nothing really new here, but overall, it's a very good, streamlined package, that plays really fast and provides some interesting decisions. I thought I would like it less, because of the small map, but it didn't matter. It's not a game about area control.

This is an '8' for me after two plays. It's probably going to stay at an '8'. Euro-ish war-game with a bit of 'take that' mechanism, which definitely caused some strife with my children, especially by 11 and 13 year old, although even my 17 year old was mad at me a couple of times. Not a lot of players looking at their cell phones between turns, because turns went quickly, but I still caught a few phone glances. Games are fairly quick, along the lines of Cosmic Encounter. In fact, there are some additional similarities to Cosmic Encounter, which Tom Vasel commented on in his review.

Wow wow wow! Blood Rage was my personal Game of the Year in 2015 and even more than two years later I still play it as much as I can and still enjoy it just as much as I did the first time! The expansions are not a must-have but they add a lot to the replayability and depth of the game.

RATING: 10
Wow! What an amazing experience playing this game! Even though I was seriously trounced, I enjoyed every minute of it.  It's one of the most engaging games I've played in a while.  Even when not my turn, I was constantly thinking about my upcoming turn and trying to deduce what the others were trying to accomplish. 

This game combines many different mechanisms in a deeply strategic way. The drafting is crucial, and, as I found, it's just as important to consider what you're passing as to what you recruit. Giving someone, say, two identical quests can really set that person up for a landslide turn for example. Even the deterministic battle was sweat-inducing.  The battles were simple and victory is sweet when you can get it (and want it) and agonizing when you don't.  

My game group loved it as well...even the guy who HATES card-driven mechanisms in games (and who actually trounced us in our first game)!  It's a game I'm eager to get back to the table, and it likely will despite our infrequent game schedule (1/month) and the size of my collection.

The production quality is top-notch. I didn't get the kickstarter version, but honestly, there's so much in this game I don't miss the few extras that came with it.  I appreciate that the retail version has plenty of monsters and alternative sculpts for the warriors.  There's really no excuse for not enjoying the base game.

RATING: 5
Pros:
1. Fun tactical game with multiple roads to victory
2. Great minis
3. Interesting card combos to explore

Cons:
1. First plays are miserable until you get to know what cards are available.
2. Losing to win is slightly annoying, and slightly over powered.
3. Playing a non-Loki strategy is fun, but extremely high risk as one bad battle can be very difficult to recover from.
4. Suffers from the Family Feud Flaw. The first 2 ages scoring points does not matter. Points all come in the last age.

Summary: The more I played initially the more I liked it. Now the more I play the more I dislike it. This game oddly feels similar to Cosmic Encounters with a bit more strategy. I've already overplayed this game and doubt I will come back to it any time soon.

RATING: 6
I wanted to like this more than I did.  I love Chaos in the Old World, but the balance in this game feels off to me, while all of the cards are overpowered, some are crazy ridiculously overpowered, especially if one of more players are unaware of them, due to them being chosen first before the cards are passed.  I also feel like the crazy powers of the cards overwhelms the board presence and many times the board presence outside of having a presence in a province was superfluous.  This game is still interesting and I would try it again, but not nearly close to the hype for me.

Got to play this for the first time 4 player, I have to say it was a blast. The game plays fast and smooth and there really isnt enough time for someone to be a passive player. You have to get in and get your hands dirty FAST. Also a lot of games can have that feeling of not wanting to be "the jerk" but this game doesnt let that happen because everyone is attacking everyone is dying immediately and honestly dying isnt REALLY setting you back and in most cases it scores you points if you play your cards right. 

The main point is that by the time the game was over we were all laughing and having a great time. We sat for about 10 minutes just talking about peoples card synergies and how they were able to score the amount of points they did. 

Doesnt overstay its welcome and honestly leaves you wanting to give it another try. Not sure Id be interested in 5 player but 4 was great.

All the worst parts of worker placement, card drafting, showdown cardplay, spending limited resources, and territory dominace in one game.  If a game can ruin your chances to compete because the player that drafts before you takes away any card that threatens a comeback, then why play more than the first round instead of 3?

Blood Rage is my favorite game at this point. Every time I play it, it is an amazing experience. For a game that takes an hour and a half, I never feel like it has overstayed its welcome. The mechanics that make this game one of the best ever is the drafting of cards to make a strategy, the battle system, and the requirement to continually adapt as at any moment another player's strategy could completely decimate even the best planned and executed strategy. Love this game! ***Wife:8

This is the game if you just want a game of action and no frills. I own this because I need a breath of fresh air now and then from all the peaceful worker placement games etc. It keeps going and going and everything is about raiding, dying, and destroying :) But it all comes together fantastically with a very fitting theme, and the art compliments it perfectly. Learning the game takes at least one play through, but the rule book is really good and it starts to click quickly, there's just a lot to learn. To me this is a must own, the game stands alone.

First four games (all 3 players) pretty much delivering on the hype on gorgeous components, interesting gameplay and fast... almost too fast. I got crushed in the first game, not knowing at all what I was doing but placed second in the other game, not too far from the first player in part because I pillaged the last region and caused the game to finish before the other two players could compete certain quests. Then placed 1st and 2nd in the other games a week later. I do love the fast playing time and multiple paths to victory, though the wargamer in me means that I'm still not able to lose by design (Loki and Fenrir strategy). Placed first with 136 points in my first (completed) 4-player game.

Like playing this with my group even though i never won.
It has a style that you cannot do the same strategy over and over again because you don't start with the same cards and your way of playing the game has to adapt to what the others players are doing.
In the end of the game there can be a lot of comebacks and the player who was winning by the time it ends won't necessary be the winner of the game when you count the points, and that is cool.

I quite understand the hype for this game but I don't want to invest too much time to know the cards. Meaning I should play at least 4 more (boring) games to know how to play. This is equivalent to say I should learn the way to counter the Loki cards. 
And BYW I don't like zombie games. All these dudes dying and coming back every turn are just zombies for me.

I wasn't too big on Kemet so I had my doubts with this one. Fortunately it was a very pleasant experience and I will definitely be up for plays of this.
I am slightly worried, however, that the replay value ain't as great as it sets out to be. Only a few cards aren't put in play each round.

This is constantly touted as a great blend of euro and ameritrash gameplay, but I barely recognize the euro mechanics. For me, every second of the game felt like that moment in Yugioh where someone shouts "you've activated my trap card!" Sure, there is little bit of control in drafting the cards at the beginning of each round, but the actual execution of battles is almost entirely unpredictable. You drafted high battle cards? Well, I drafted cards that cancel high battle cards! Bet you didn't see that coming! I won my last game by simply sitting in two zones, filling them up with my warriors, then drafting all of the Quest cards. This is not a good game.

RATING: 2
This is one of my biggest disappointments.  I expected so much because people have touted this game as so amazing.  I very much disliked this game.

First, it seemed to have a huge run away leader problem.  If someone is lucky enough to draft some cards that synchronize well early in the game they can jump to an early lead.  If you weren't able to get many upgrades in the first age AND had your troops destroyed during the first age I don't think you have any chance of coming back.  It's just not fun for that player.

Second, the luck of the draw isn't HUGE, but it's definitely noticeable.  There are decidedly better cards than others for each age and if you didn't happen to draft those cards you are going to have a bad time.

Third, the battling is so over rated.  There are too many battle cards in the game for the amount of battling that will occur.  It's too easy to avoid conflict because it's too easy to stack the odds in your favor.  If you see someone coming into your territory and you can't win, just leave.  This is a bit of a simplification, but I don't want to go into all the details to explain this (it'd take too long).

The miniatures are awesome and the components are pretty great, in general.

An excellent game that can be played quickly, has depth and good game mechanics that work well and makes sense for the theme in which the Norse mythology comes through brilliantly.

I feel that this is a game that must to be played with its expansion of Kickstarter exclusives, Gods of Asgard and Mystics expansion for it truly to become a great game. An epic experience within 2.5 hours

Ameritrashy game with some Euro mechanics. Card drafting is the central mechanisms and way to individiualize your clan. Combat is interesting and there is a lot of out-thinking your opponent. Key is to discover combos of different cards/powers and also utilize them to score a lot of points. There is certainly skill involved.

Even though it has no dice and some mechanisms are Euroy, this is a pure Ameritrash game to me. Combat and take-that events are such a major part of the game. But this is also a reason, why I think it is a good but not a great game. 

Miniatures are gorgeous and art (especially on cards) is good. In total I understand why this is the game of the year  for a lot of people.

I only own the base game so I can't comment on the expansions (other than 5 player which I've tried) but I quite enjoy this one.  The board gets tight through the 3 rounds and makes for some nice conflict.  I do feel like some of the cards are a bit too synergistic and forces players to draft to block others instead of developing their own strategies.  It also leads to games being outright blowouts in some cases.  It's too fun not to like though.

LATEST HOT WEURO - Thoroughly enjoyed my first 4P play.  Lots of direct conflict (a plus in my book) and yet somehow when I thought about game I have played that have a similar vibe Knizia's tile layer Samurai comes strongly to mind.  Definitely a little Nexus Ops and Cyclades are in there as well.  All of these are games I rate highly.  I have reservations about lack of balance with some card powers and combinations but will reserve judgment until I have a couple more plays under my belt.  Looking forward to my next play of this game.

This game is a revelation.  I am not great at this game.

It combines so many things in so many quality ways.  You have your starting army, you have your starting stats you have a clever mechanism for invading and attacking.  There are no dice.

This game is really well thought out and just a true joy to play, even if Sam Healey stomps you into the ground cause everything that can go wrong in Stage three does.  But it would be a shame for anyone to miss having a chance to play this game.  If you have the opportunity, try it, just be aware, strategies exist to stomp you into oblivion so be aware of them so you can use them or prevent others from doing so.  

Rage on.

Not well balanced at all IMO.  To swingy with cards and dependent on drafting more than anything else.  May as well just play Sushi Go and avoid the extra 1.5 hours of the rest of the game.

Light, fun tactical scrum with players utilising card abilities to complete quests, introduce monsters, buff their troops or just mess with everyone.
Played well in our 3 player game.

Reviews suggested it plays ok with 2 and it does !
Yay - might be able to convince the wife to like area control games yet....

Ok - the more i play this, the more appreciative of the card draft design behind this area control game.

After several games, there are quite a few rules that could do with a FAQ.  4 players seems to be the sweet spot.

I've only played this once so far, although I expect I'll get to play again before too long. It was a 5-player game, and was really quite a lot of fun. It reminded me more than a bit of Chaos in the Old World (by the same designer), due to the general dynamic of paying to summon units on to the board, upgrading those units to give them special abilities, and having them fight each other, without this fighting being necessarily the whole point of the game. In other ways, of course, it is very different - lacking the asymmetry and the cool alternative routes to victory, but with other elements like the Quests and the 3 different upgrade tracks. Not to mention the crucial card draft at the start of each of the 3 ages, which I suspect between experienced players will constitute the real "meat" of the game. I thought this was an excellent game that I'd love to play again. And the miniatures, particularly the huge ones for the monsters, are very impressive too :)

The ability to gain points for warriors killed in battle is fine but  there is a tendency for players to throw warriors away in suicide missions. Whilst the Vikings saw dying sword in hand as the best way to go they usually fought because they were after economic gain, military success and glory. They did not seek futile engagements. As in Germanic warfare, warriors would fight to the death around their chief.

Apart from this minor criticism, the game is entertaining and plays quickly. The monster figures are particularly well done.

RATING: 9.143
The best miniatures I've ever seen. Fun game with lots of action. It's a game about battling for control and to pillage, and that's what it delivers. There's no place for people to hide. Add in the drafting and card bonus effects to make things unpredictable and exciting.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The obvious start to this is that the figures are fantastic. Really detailed and great to look at. The larger monsters have a nice weight to them too. This is, undoubtedly, what will attract a lot of people to playing.

The card drafting aspect is a decent mechanic - it just doesn't work overly well here. Some cards are obviously superb and should always be taken, no choice required. Some are terrible and are easily passed until you're stuck having to take them. The size of these cards is also an issue - why do they have to be so small?

This leads to the most important bit - gameplay. It's an original idea, alright. But it's not really all that good. Area control and fighting, normally a decent concept. The idea of getting points for defeated fighters is unique. But, for a fighting game - it doesn't seem to engross you as actually battling. Throwing men into a hopeless battle, just so you can pick up a few extra VP from their death - doesn't really tie in to the idea the game gives you, of Vikings in glorious combat ending in Valhalla.

The length of the game is also an issue. If you read my reviews, you'll know I'm a big fan of longer games. But when there's not that much happening that I care to track in a game - the longer game just turns into a chore.

So overall, the excitement factor in this game just isn't there for me. It's an OK game that is simple enough to pick up, but would be one I'd have to be talked in to playing again rather than suggesting to anyone to bring it.

Blood Rage is meh for me. There's nothing special about the drafting of the outlandishly tiny cards. All the "hype" comes from the miniatures, and I am not one to get very excited about miniatures. There is a problem with catching up to the leader; a bad first age means you are almost certainly going to lose the game. Playing against experienced players is a nightmare, and you'll almost definitely lose then too. While I'm criticizing, I also think spending "rage" as a resource is a little tacky.

Aside from this, the art is pretty good, and the combat system is interesting. I'm a fan of the board slowly shrinking turn after turn, squeezing the players together and forcing more interaction. The center space fights also add a lot of tension. These are really neat mechanics that are enough to make me want to play at least a few more times. Not a game I own or want to own, but I'll play it with the right people from time to time.

I was very suspicious about such good looking game as I'm not ameritrash games fan per se. Fortunately I was wrong as this is very clean mature area control / battle / card drafting game. Even more important, FUN for 3 or 4 players (don't know about 2 or 5, but looks like it shines with more player count). 

Except board and minies, which are great, other components are average or below average.

Very good game. That said, it's drafting from a ton of "over powered" cards, which means that it's rather fragile. In the few times I've played, I've seen 100+ point spreads between first and last place, and it's sort of a crapshoot as to who gets the good stuff.

Based on play and reading here, it seems like the solution is to only play with a group that all know the game and cards, so that players can self-regulate the game. Because the game itself doesn't do much to keep things balanced on it's own.

Enjoyed the theme and the minis are very well crafted (although scantily clad women are unnecessary). Mixture of drafting, area control and card play. Like 7 Wonders meets Smallworld meets Cosmic Encounter battling. A nice fusion, but I imagine it gets better after a number of plays and you're aware of what all the cards do. Requires a lot of pre-planning and your turn can be scuppered quite easily. Would like to give it another go

reddit 2015 recommendation
"Blood Rage deserves a spot on this list, for a couple of reasons:
It nails asymmetric gameplay, allowing each viking clan to create their own identity through the course of the three eras.
It plays very fast, oftentimes having an era end before you expect it, meaning you can't mess around
It encourages aggression to the highest degree, very much like Kemet, meaning there's no time to sit back and watch or build up - it's time to fight right out of the gate
The Battle cards are incredible, and allowing up to all 4 (5 with expansion) players to participate in a single battle blows most other similar games (Kemet, as good as it is) away when they only allow 1v1 at a time.
The shrinking amount of space to fight only reinforces all of the drive towards aggression."

:thumbsup: Great graphic design. Clear but thematic spaces on the game board. Your player board doubles as a player aid for the different turn actions.
:thumbsup: Many equally valid paths to victory, all leaving room to sabotage other players' well laid plans, or to bluff about your own intentions.
:thumbsup: It looks way more complicated than it is. Rules are easy to explain.

:thumbsdown: A sceptic could say this is an overproduced game.
:thumbsdown: Experienced players often have the upper hand over new players due to their knowledge of the types of cards that are in the decks. The first time(s) you play, you're mostly familiarizing yourself with the different ways to win rather than really having a shot at winning against more experienced. I've seen this discourage some new players.

Apart from the visual beauty of the miniatures, this relatively easy game to learn conceals a ton of strategy.  Card drafting gives it an extra thrill and in-card text makes events totally unpredictable.  All this makes for a fun game which oif played with a good group of players manages to conceal its Euro character behind the typical viking rage and glory of death character.

Only but I can find is that there are relatively few cards which on one hand makes it easier to learn, but on the other hand, possibly after a few games, you´d be wishing there are more cards.  For example it is quite possible to make two identical quests which has doubtful sense.  Maybe a futurable expansion...

This is a game based on viking barbarians who long for a glorious death in battle so that they can enjoy the afterlife in the Valhalla. That being said, why such a game should have such simple and anticlimatic combat rules while being mostly an area control game with the chance of being swinged completely by an handful of gamechanging cards, is totally beyond me. The miniatures are nice, but they are not worth the "fights" they are going to be used for. With a completely different settings (and with more balanced cards), this game would work way better, but as it is, it's not about vikings having epic fights, it's about vikings having a stroll in the countryside and eventually sit down to play a completely broken card game. Pity.

It's a pretty good hybrid game that suffers a little from an obvious noob strategy of going pure Loki. But after a couple of games, players are less likely to let someone pull that off and new strategies start to appear. The only other issue I've noticed is that in a 5 player game, someone always ends up way behind points wise and it pretty much becomes impossible for them to win.

THIS is my number one game of GenCon 2015. After one play under my belt, it was an instant hit.  After half a dozen plays, it is one of my favorite games.

I bought this on a whim on the first day because I knew it was going to sell out quickly.  I'd heard good reviews form several podcasters who all had wildly varying tastes so I knew there had to be something to the game that would appeal to me.   

Honestly, it is one of the best games I've ever played.  There is no fluff in this game.  Everything is essential.   One of the comments I've read said there is "chrome just for the sake of chrome" in this game.  I can't get on board with that statement. The minis are over the top gorgeous, of course, but everything else was so streamlined, from the uncluttered board to the functional, intuitive player mats.  It's not one of those huge FFG games with 1000 components.  There aren't dozens of different damage markers and status icons, etc...Everything has been stripped to the bare essentials in this game short of reducing the Minis to wooden cubes.  

There is so much to like here, but I'll focus on my favotirite thing:  Card drafting.  The card drafting is amazingly agonizing.  Not because you cann't find cards you want, but because every card is incredible.  You want them all.  And you know everyone else wants them all, and you definitely don't want to pass them anything juicy but you are going to!  The choice is between a fantastic card and several other fantastic cards.  Drafting is also easy for new players.  Each card is associated with a particular Norse God - just pick one or two names to focus on, draft them, and you'll have a great engine all ready to go!  But the great thing is that you don't really have to get locked into one particular strategy - you can change your strategy from round to round just by drafting a different set of cards.

This also plays surprisingly well with two, even though I miss seeing more variety in cards each round.  

Instantly one of my favorite games of all time.

Blood Rage is a fun cross between 7 Wonders and Chaos in the Old World. It plays faster than Chaos, and the asymmetry builds up over time rather than being present from the start. I don't think it really works that well with 2, but it's great with 4. I like that you can build strategies around winning combats, or you can build a strategy around losing them.

This streamlined version of Chaos in the Old World is very fun.  Production values are excellent and the gameplay is quick and easy.  There are a couple of warts, though.  The Loki cards seem a bit more broken than all of the others, giving me the feeling that you should hate draft them.  I'm curious to see how the game plays with 2p as our 5p game had a big runaway leader and the spread in pts was from 193-31 high to low.  It was still very fun and enjoyable.

Norse Mythology Area Control Miniatures.

Pro: Amazing components. Card drafting mechanic works very well. Many many paths to victory - many ways to counterract things that tend to plague area control games (such as runaway leader, etc.). Easy to understand, yet difficult to master. Very balanced throughout. Very little luck involved.

Con: Very strong theme - which, as said with other games of this theme, could be off-putting to some.

I did pretty poorly in my first play, which is to be expected. But even being behind all game (we're talking everyone else scoring in the 50s while I'm in the 20s), I was able to catch up at the end. The game was an absolute blast and I'm upset that it took me as long as it did to actually get it to the table. There aren't any "bad" cards and everything just always sounds crazy, but it all balances out.

I really really enjoy this game.  It might very well be the best game in my collection right now.  Why does it deserve such high praise?

1.  Relatively simple ruleset.  It is very easy to learn this game and teach others how to play.  You could absolutely teach a non-gamer Blood Rage, as long as they've had *some* gaming experience (e.g., Risk) in their past.

2.  Great pacing.  The draft is engaging and simultaneous.  Individual player actions are quickly resolved.  Battles do not take up an inordinate amount of time, but are very tense and meaningful.  You can finish a game in under 2 hours if your players don't lag.

3.  Strategic.  There are multiple pathways to victory, as in Questing, Conquering, and Loki.  You can mix and match, and even switch your focus mid-game and still win.  You need to be careful about drafting, and what you pass to certain players.  But it's also not hard to come up with a strategy and just pursue it to see what happens.

4.  Components.  Amazing.  I wish the board wasn't quite so heavy-metal, but other than that, wow.  This contributes enormously to engagement.

Downsides?
1.  Losing hurts.  You can find yourself out of the running pretty quickly, if you have a poor first age.  I did this one game by following a poorly structured Loki strategy that backfired, and the rest of the game was somewhat tedious for me since I knew I was out of it.  But it was my fault, and that's my punishment.  Not a fault of the design.

2.  Some combos and strategies do seem a little OP.  But they're not consistent enough to break the game.  And the game is fast enough that you it won't bother you much when it happens.  And if you're the one pulling it off, it feels pretty awesome.

Eric Lang's master opus.

Blood Rage relation to Citow is kinda like ... 
[i]you know that dude you knew at high school that was really into metal, wore long hair and did crazy stuff all the time? Now you meet him 15 years later and you barely recognize him in his business suit, short hair, immaculate attire. But he claims deep down he's still rock'n'roll and shows you a tiny tattoo on his ankle (under Hugo Boss sock). [/i]

Instead of figuring out how BR is a hybrid (if it is) it would easier to point out where it's not an euro.  
- There's drafting, but not 7W style, but more of MtG vibe as what you draft becomes your hand. 
- err ... that's it, the rest is quite euroey. 

Sure, there's combat. Which manages to be even more deterministic and calculable than in Smallworld. You count the value of your armies and compare numbers, add some more numbers hidden in your hand and voila. But the numbers from your hand aren't really hidden as they were firstly drafted and secondly if you lost a combat everybody knows what you have. So, no tension here. And tension is even more diluted because people don't necessarily care about winning as there are ways to get more points by losing a fight. Huh? It's a good sign a game is far far away from ameritrash when visceral enjoyment that makes playing the game fun does not giveth points. This game is like the Risk version with the least amount of risk(ing) possible. 

What bothered me the most is how designer controlled everything is and how little impact players as a collective have on the dynamics of the game. You're just doing what you're doing, countering other people's plans (not people directly!). Cards are orchestrated into three balanced eras (blah). Where's groupthink? Where's bashing on the leader? (okay, there might be some traces of this, but didn't see it in our game). 

Oh yeah, remember the area majority thing Citow had? It's kinda sorta still there, but diluted - some cards you draft allow you to score majorities. But: Firstly - getting majority is not as hard to accomplish (as you have a choice between 2-3 different areas). Secondly - quests are hidden. So, while traces of area majority remain, it creates no tension thus its soul is gone. 

Blood Rage seems like a study in how to take the structure of Citow and make it as euro-ey (balanced, calculable, tension-less) as possible. While the game isn't as optimisation prone and MPS-ey as workerplacements, you can pick old school euros like T&E or El Grande and they have more player dynamics, more tension, more psychology, more people in them! 

Maybe this game is actually a different type of dude than I described above. 
[i]It's the metal dude guy you meet, but turns out, that's just his visual attire as he's managing 10 bands, organising 3 festivals, while having another million dollar business on the side, a yacht, and a villa in the posh part of town, and of course he's married into a rich political family. The metal thing -   merely make up.[/i]
(Yeah, those minis... just bling on top of an euro)

Absolutely great game, with Gorgeous Miniatures and artwork and a very strong theme. Sometimes a run away leader problem, but that can be mitigated once all players know what they are doing especially in the beginning God's Gift stage(drafting)
Run into a couple problems with teaching new players as your choice is to go easy(which involves playing\drafting non-strategically) or just throwing them to the wolves and experienced players winning, which is the only reason This isn't in the perfect game category in my mind.

Would definitely recommend and suggest learning as a game group together.

I love this game. Not necessarily one that gets to the table very often but it has beautiful production quality. I was lucky enough to run into Eric Lang at an unpub convention and got him to sign/doodle on my box cover for this game. I wish I had been into the hobby with this kickstarted but... all I can do is look forward to the future (a.k.a Rising Sun's KS campaign ha!).

This game features a variety of cool mechanisms that work quite nicely together. Card drafting was the thing that initially peaked my interest. The cards range from upgrades for your various engine components (military, ship, etc.), combat points and abilities, and secret objective cards that score you points for a variety of things (e.g. area control, dying in battle, etc.). Love this one!

BLOOD RAGE!! What a great game. At one point it was my favorite of all time, but I have since cooled. It could definitely make it's way back up, but as of right now I have not been able to have any real competitive games as I am always teaching new gamers. I hope that people want to play and master it, that way I can really get some competitive games 3-5 player games of Blood Rage. Love the minis and production, CMON standard here. Eric Lang's best.

This is a very fun and interesting hybrid game. It combines drafting, action points, and combat mechanisms.

Over the course of the game every player will develop a unique clan that has it's own unique strengths and approach to earning glory. And each approach is a legitimate winning strategy, if executed well. Speaking of earning glory, the gameplay and the theme (of viking clans vieing to earn glory before ragnorok) are perfectly integrated.

Finally, it has to be said - this game is gorgeous, especially if you paint the figures. The Kickstarter extras are great, but I haven't felt deprived for not having them. Set up this game at a meetup and you will _always_ attract potential players.

Held off originally because I though it looked complicated but boy was I wrong. It implements a very clean and streamlined drafting mechanic which dictates which actions you will likely that during that round. This mechanic supports multiple strategy styles from round to round and there are many routes to victory, something not seen much in area control/fighting games. A  fighting game that can be taught and learned very quickly, offers multiple paths to victory AND plays pretty quickly...this is the only one that I know in my collection that ticks off all those boxes.

It's decent, but playing this after Kemet made it less fun. Experience trumps all in this game and makes it so someone who's played before will always win due to combos...at one point, I had 66 points while 2nd place had 25. That's not great game design.

This game is a bit of a conundrum for me because of the way my group tends to play it. Love the drafting, the minis and all that. What I don't like is what generally winds up happening is everyone chooses an area and loads up in it to the point that they just say "Okay I'm pillaging here" and there's either no more room, or they are so loaded that no one wants to just lose and they take what's there with no battle. Yes I realize you don't "have" to do that, it's just what always happens so in turn the game becomes anticlimactic except for Yggdrasil.

After one play.  I ran the board using a few Loki cards.  

I appreciate that the game encourages constant conflict, and love the monsters, but there is a little too much chaos for my taste and I'm worried some cards may be overpowered (although this should be mitigated as we learn the game since there is card drafting).

Rated after first play. It's incredible game with lots of interaction and direct conflict, multiple ways to score points make it even more than just area control or war game. It's modern hybryd game with theme and strong euro influence.

Great game after playing it more than once. When you're first playing the random card selection changes the game completely, after drafting your hand and knowing what cards exist, you can plan how you want to play. First play-through we did each hand random and I was shafted by the cards I had, others had perfect hands, so much that my brother lapped the score board twice after all points were calculated, more points in 1 round than existed on scoreboard. Drafting is a necessity to play correctly. Great because you can win by battles or by suiciding battles depending on how you play.

A solid enough game and plenty to do, but a few niggles prevent this getting a higher rating for me. The overall quality is a little unbalanced and does it a bit of a disservice. The figures are fantastic, but the player mats feel cheap and the map is not nearly as polished as it deserves to be. It might sound a little unfair, but when the core of the game is genuinely this good, it really stands out.

Amazing game and very popular at our game nights.  I enjoy how the drafting really changes up the game and the anticipation on what the other players are going to do.  Playing a quest to get another player to make their move so you can then play one of the monsters that changes the points they would receive at the end of the Age keeps the players on the edge.

Better than Kemet. Doesn't fire CitOW as I heard from some people, this is more comparable to Kemet as it is focused more on unique upgrade paths rather than innate asymmetry.

Feels like a tight design where the diff paths are very balanced yet you still get to feel powerful and do crazy shit so it doesn't feel too sterile.

You are rewarded for predicting your opponents intentions because of the action point system which is cool.

On the downside, all the different ways to get points lead to lots of little optimizations at times (micromanaging VP i find not fun)

I feel like it won't have as much replay for me as I'd want it to, and actually expect rating would trend downward on repeated play, but for now I'll give it the benefit of the doubt as first play was really fun.

I LOVE this game! The miniatures are outstanding and the game mechanics are smooth. I do wish the miniatures came pre-painted.

But that is a minor complaint - this game is a keeper!

Was almost a favorite game at first play but games since has really brought this game down for me to the point I rather not play it. I find each game to be very same-y in how it flows, certain cards control the flow of the game (not win the game but will control who wins), certain cards are just way too good to not take, and if you aren't doing well in the game then you are just sitting there not doing much. Really lost my interest in playing it repeatedly. Some people will really like it but not my tastes any more.

After first play: Huh? Did I miss something? Think I expected more than a decent Area-control-euro with a lot of chrome. It's like a rich mans El Grande, just lighter.

Now, if that's the kind of game they wanted to make, I think they succeded. You've got your cool start-of-round drafting, relatively short play time, wonderful components and seemingly balanced gameplay. It's a flawless package actually. But it's not unique og special in any way, and to be fair, sometimes that's perfectly fine. I just expected more. 

Blood Rage is like a Hollywood blockbuster. High production value, great special effects and a famous director behind the camera. In the end though it just lacks something I can't define. Like a lot of smash hits from Hollywood, Blood Rage is in the end, forgettable.

card drafting and opportunistic scoring make for compelling game-play; seems unnecessarily over-produced as the minis make things cluttered and a bit confusing which I find actually detracts rather than adds to the experience, while at the same time the cards are under-produced and are among the smallest cards I've ever seen

When I first played "Blood Rage" I thought it was a very middling game that was incredibly over produced.

"Blood Rage" is allegedly a reimplementation of a much older game by the same designer that had far lower quality components, and was probably sold for half the price. The current rating of "Midgard" on BGG evidences that my initial impression was accurate.

Some obvious and dominant strategies turn later plays into a race to see who can get the cards to pull-off those strategies first.

Blood Rage would just be a whole lot more fun if you streamlined out the whole map, area control and actions elements - Victory is 80%+ decided in the draft anyway so why not just make it a pure drafting game instead of wasting half an hour evaluating the draft through other mechanisms.

4 Player Game: 9/10. The four player game fixed all of the problems below. The drafting, while it took a longer time, made the game more balanced. The person who won actually beat all of us by  creating a Valhalla engine that was giving him 5 points for each figure that he released from Valhalla (ended up with a 55 point swing). I was going for the quest route and lost by about 10 points. The game is much longer with 4 players (especially if some are new to the game), but it makes the game much more tense, exciting and balanced. 



2-player game: 4/10. It's kind of hard to rate as I only played a two-player game which was a horrible idea. The mechanics and game play were decent, and obviously the miniatures are amazing, but the two player game was horrendous. First round, my wife won a huge battle by playing  a +5  from her hand, and that was it for me. After being decimated in that battle, I could not come back. She was able to freely pillage the board while I had to spend the rest of my turns getting people back on the board.  Since the warriors carry over, she maintained her dominance the rest of the game. Also I had the misfortune of drafting 0 quest cards during the final round--making it literally impossible to win; I just forfeited instead. So, while I can see that there is a good game at the core here, this is one of the worst two player games I have ever played; a game like Inis has a much better battle system for 2.

You'll either love it or hate it, but this is the best marriage of Euro mechanics and Ameritrash components and theme you can buy.  Major drawbacks are it can be crushingly unforgiving to new players and it's yet another CMON game with a bunch of probably-must-have Kickstarter exclusives.

The game is not complicated. You draft cards each round, which you can use to customize your clan (they all start the same). These give you new abilities, recruit additional forces, etc. They are associated with one of several gods, each with a particular style of effect (e.g., better combat, more VP, tricky effects). After the draft, everyone takes actions one at a time -- move on the board, attack, etc. At the end of the round, VP is awarded for control of one of the regions (specified at the start of the round, subject to change based on some card effects).

There are some interesting systems at work, but you definitely have to be aware of the card powers and such -- I, at least, would need additional plays! This might be worth another go despite the drafting, although I doubt it will become a favorite of mine.

This is a card drafting and area control game (a slightly heavier version of 7 wonders + Small World). I tend to not like area control games, but can appreciate this game.

I don't think the minis were necessary especially the large scale of the monsters compared to the other minis. Ultimately this game feel overhyped to me.

Only a few games in right now, so the rating is subject to change. The game is pretty to look at, has great concepts and found a way to avoid the issue of the "drôle de guerre", where no player wants to attack because of its weakening effect on one's forces. It's a stretched logic though: I understand the glory of dying in combat, but it becomes a rather poor justification for voluntarily killing tons of units through suicidal VP generation.

My biggest gripe with Blood Rage right now is how chaotic the games have turned out to be. Card effect ranges from "slight advantage" to "game changer" or even "VP maelstrom". When you trigger a conflict (pillage) you just have to hope some wild effect will not turn your well-thought plans into a shockingly bad move, but there is not that much you can do to anticipate. Costs seems off too. There is a "1-cost" card that allows you to get a VP for every unit lost at the end of an age, while other costlier cards have very situational effects and/or lower VP potential. Green cards are a bit curious too. It's usually pretty easy to fill the requirements, having not to win a territory, but only dominate in one of the region's territory. It's hard to tell that a player is even trying to fill a quest requirement by looking at its actions, and the fight for territorial dominance has rarely been tensed and harshly contested.

Sure, you can technically see several cards in play in a given age through the draft; sure, the draft tends to create a "somewhat" equal distribution of strong cards, but I have started to see this mechanism as a warning label: how wild can you go with cards imbalance by simply telling yourself, as a designer, that the draft will just even things out? And the logic has its limits too. In any case, all of this brings the game closer to Ameritrash than I expected when I was reading the rules.

Overall, this turns out more negative that I wanted it to be, and I have yet to play more, but I had high expectations.

Never had much of an interest in this but played it 2/3/2018. I enjoyed it quite a bit. The attack cards screwed me majorly twice. I was initially thinking I wouldn't mine owning this but then I started to think it kind of reminds me of Age of Empires III and if I had a choice, I'd rather play AoEIII which to me is a step down from Dominant Species which is an all-time favorite. So... it's a good game. Lite enough to bring people into, maybe a training ground for DS but then, AoEIII could be training for DS as well.

Update:
Got a few more plays in. Still love the game, but it's quite swingy and sometimes the draft screws you over. All part of the game, but knocks it down a little for me.
--

Was extremely skeptical about this game and was turned off by the hype it had. Played this weekend and... amazing.

The theming and miniatures are spot on of course, but the gameplay is really where it shines. I really liked the drafting in Blood Rage. A lot of tension in choosing which cards to keep and which cards to pass to the other players.

I was also pleasantly surprised that Blood Rage played more like a euro, yet it still scratched that "fight and kill with my units on a board" itch. I liked that there were a lot of strategic decisions in how much you might commit to Yggdrasil or if you might sacrifice units for more glory or whether to focus more on battles or quests and how that affected the drafting phase.

Just altogether a great package. Simple but deep. Random enough with the drafting that it's pretty fair, even for those who have not played before. Love it.

nice ideas, but some bugs. We played 3 rounds and only one of them was rly einjoyable. One failed hard, while one player blocked a whole area for the rest of the game and won easily without giving the rest a chance. I think the rules need some fix there.

This is absolutely best PvP game you can get. Just because you are winning battles and you cover more lands than your opponent doesnt necessary means you are going to win. There are multiple ways how to approach this game, literally. Not like the games that tells you that as well, but in the end you all do the same thing. Here every player can do something completely different. It has one of my favourite game mechanic, drafting and with experienced players, it's really fun to face the dilema "should i take what i want, or should i deny him a card that would help him immensely". This is a must play game and it deserves to earn a spot in your collection.

Btw for all of you who says that Loki strategy is OP: Learn how to play, and you will realise how easily you can counter that. Last three games I played I won against Loki strategy.

Played at two players, and the game was both interesting and entertaining, but the area control dynamic would have been more interesting with three or more players, as it means that each faction can choose whether to engage or not.  At two players, if a "Pillage" action is not contested, then the pillaging player automatically gains the rewards.  I also felt that it was inherently more valuable to gain the Rage rewards early, in order to be able to take more action in later rounds, whereas having higher axes was not as important given that the glory rewards for quests were guaranteed, but glory was not gained in uncontested pillage actions.

Wasn't sure how this was going to go down with my gaming group.  We play more euro's/co-op's.  Thought this might be too adversarial.  Happy to say it went over well.  Great art.  Awesome minis. Took the first age for us to get the idea but then the strategies started to appear.  The card drafting was tense.  Too many good options.  Close game with a one point win for myself.  I was a little worried about the size of the cards.  Thought the text might be a little small but it was very legible.  Cant wait to play again.

RATING: 5
Inexplicably popular point-salad euro in Ameritash clothing. Miniatures are deployed to the regions of the game board, which can be "pillaged". If uncontested, the player takes the value of the bonus tile there; if contested, all present players play an attack bonus card, add up their units' strengths and the winner scores glory points from the battle. It's also possible to score glory from special cards, from dead units, from completed quests (typically have the most strength in a specific region at the end of the round), having units in a specific location destroyed at the end of the round and so on. Timing, tension, blah blah blah.

Despite the miniatures -- not Games Workshop calibre but otherwise excellent: better than previous CMoN games and substantially better than "boardgame quality" -- it's very much a euro in style. The key strategic element is the card drafting at the start of each round, and the issues typical of that mechanism are compounded by the limited card pool (many single cards) and strong focus on card synergy. A player's success is to some degree predicated on both random card distribution and on their opponents' willingness to hate-draft.

The rest of the play is highly tactical, with broader strategic concerns emerging chiefly in determining which units to leave on the board for the next round and where. But drafting again makes this difficult; planning for specific quests, for example, is unreliable. As expected from an Eric Lang game, chaotic special card powers abound, so there is certainly no such thing as a sure thing. 

This is another hybrid design that seems to me like the worst of both worlds. From its Ameritrash lineage it gets expensive miniatures and random effects; on the euro side it gets unthematic, abstract point-salad. The theme works only if you try very hard.

Don't get me wrong, the game does work. There are, being charitable, multiple paths to victory (uncharitable: several ingredient ratios to compose a salad), and genuine player differentiation emerges from the card draft. There is significant direct player interaction. It's just not enough.

What I find particularly bizarre are the favourable comparisons to Cthulhu Wars, a game with some similar mechanisms but genuine asymmetry, much more focused gameplay and much more theme. I would choose it in a heartbeat ahead of this one.

If Stefan feld were to design a wargame it might look like this.

I bought this game really to see if it lived up to the hype. 
The drafting is enjoyable with lots of variety in the cards for upgrades and combat. The mechanics are easily accessible but combine to allow for satisfying game play. 
The components range From generic chits to amazing miniatures. Really well sculpted figures that add to the game even if mechanically they aren't needed. 
I enjoyed the game and will definitely play it again. I don't feel it is the be all end all of board games but is certainly worth having and a good experience.

The underlying game is quite okay (without being good or great), although nothing spectacular. Apart from the drafting (which is good) most game decisions come down to a combat card bluff (like in Cosmic Encounter).
But what really disturbs me (and detracts from the game!) are the gorish illustrations and the (totally unnecessary) miniatures. They are even worsening the gameplay because they don't even show the strength of the character they portray (like a regular game counter would do). If you are a 10 year old boy, you probably find these miniatures cool, but for me they are crap.
But I am afraid as long as people are collecting close to a million dollars with projects like this on Kickstarter we will see more resources and talent sunk into the production of "showcases" like this instead into the development of really sophisticating new games.

Best competitive board game I have yet played. Great theme of real vikings and mythological creatures. Great art on everything from the boards and to the cards. Every playthrough has the same feel of dread, excitement and boldness or sneakiness (depending on your strategy), but every playthrough has a different and evolving strategy. Every strategy feels balanced, but can get overpowered if not stopped. And ofcourse the miniatures are the most amazing creations ever. Highly recommend it. Had tons of fun while losing and winning.

RATING: 7
Really clean game design.

In my first game I spanked everyone else at the table.  I had a really good first age and managed to pillage the central area.  Then in the second age I got wolfman, which combined with some Tyr's cards basically let me "halifax hammer" my way to victory.

I had the ability to keep my cards after combat.  I had the Wolfman who meant that each fight was only with monsters (so I couldn't be beaten by sheer numbers) and my Tyr's battle cards combined with my Tyr's clan upgrade and the battle card that let me play it for 3 strength after everyone had played their battle cards meant that I had a guaranteed 11 strength in every fight and my opponents could only use monsters in battle, meaning that they had to come up with at least 7 damage to beat me (which didn't happen).

I was able to get an early lead and in this game I never lost the fight for the centre and by the end I was almost apologising I had so badly snowballed the game.

I also had Fenrir who I used on the final round to grab 20 points.  I had to work for it though and it felt great when it came off.

Honestly this game was spoiled by the Wolfman.

Feels like there are some balance issues that take experienced players to self-balance. Not something I'm really a fan of in design as self-balancing feels a bit weird. The game is still fun and has a lot of cool upgrades and stuff, but I'm also disappointed about how the Kickstarter edition had so many special things that changes the game that isn't in other editions. Also, combat feels a bit lackluster in some aspects where you know you'll lose and won't have a chance of some crazy wins. Would maybe be better if there were more battles and more conflict with bigger swings, but definitely not a killer for me. Still fun and something I think is neat and good for a true Ameritrashy time.

Most Euro-Style Ameritrash game I've ever played.  Card drafting was cool, the battle-each-other-but-not-really-directly was interesting.  More my style of fighting than a Risk Style Dice-Rolling.  So many possible strategies when looking at cards while drafting, but I kinda felt that once you choose a strat you have to see it through.  The 3 tracks to manage were cool, and there was so legit choice to be made when I could only choose one.  Limits of figures on the board was cool too.  I would have to play another couple of times to determine whether or not I can continually play it.

On paper, Blood Rage is really good. Highly detailed miniatures! Highly interactive area-control game! Scales well from 2 to 5 players! In practice, the miniatures look muddy and confusing on the board if you don't go out of your way to paint them (and really, if I were in this hobby to paint miniatures, I wouldn't be playing boardgames). The promised highly interactive gameplay gets completely overwhelmed by the card draft - if you do poorly in the draft, then you are going to do poorly in the "play" phase of the game. It's not bad... I'm just disappointed. I'd rather just play Chaos in the Old World any day.

RATING: 6
Good first impressions. Fast moving and easy to play game. While feel and theme is about conquest, game focus is on managing action points (Rage), timing actions, and drafting and using cards. Interesting special actions and scoring conditions. Not as much variety as some other comparable conquest games.
Would look a lot better with faction colored plastic for the pieces, for those who aren't going to paint them.
Downrated 1 point for silly cheesecake female figures (and weird putting them all in one faction).

Painted: 0/?

This is currently my favorite Ameri-Trash / Euro hybrid style game. That said, I have not played some of the other classic hybrids like Kemet or Cyclades. This game is amazingly refined. The miniatures are amazing but the cards and player mats are a bit underwhelming. Looking forward to adding the expansions into the mix at some point. This game most reminds me of a more sophisticated version of Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation. Actual Score 9.65

RATING: 7
Solid game, but for all the things it has going for it (upgradeable race, nice miniatures, multiple ways to score points) it remains a king-of-the-hill style type of game with two main gripes:
- if you have a newbie on the table the player sitting clockwise from him is going to win the game as he basically has two piles to draft from
- sometimes you just don't get the cards you are aiming for but you realise it too late, being screwed before you even play that round. Of course, this is your own fault, but is it fun?

Won't mind playing this game, but much prefer Chaos in the Old World to which this game is often compared. I'm also surprised by the comparison as it feels more of a Nexus Ops with drafting. That being said, we have one non KS-copy in our gaming group, it is a solid game to play but quickly needs another expansion to really stay fresh. Or a KS copy which will cost an arm and a leg and then some. Not going that way.

This game is one of my favourites. Components are great, miniaturea awesome but the game itself makes this a 'must have'. Drafting mechanic is very nice since their are many different strategies to pick. This makes some less obvious choices the best card to draft. The battles are very dynamic since losing a battle can be a good thing. 
Some people complain about the Loki strategy to be unbalanced but this is simply not true.
My biggest con is that the game isn't very friendly to new players when there are more experienced players on the table. That said, the game is awesome in all other ways. Above con can be treated by showing the most important cards per ages, before you start drafting.

Pretty good game except for a couple features:  a player can fill a territory completely and own it round after round, and there's absolutely nothing you can do about it.  If they draft quests for it (which can just be lucky to get one from the first draw and otherwise requires opponents to hate-draft and weaken themselves as a result - i.e. the player that takes the quest and doesn't need it helps all of the other players to his own detriment) and have the late game Ragnarok zone, it can really be frustrating, again, because there's just nothing you can do about it, literally.

Otherwise, this is a very fun game.  The components are amazing (game is overproduced, imo, but still remarkable).  I'm happy to play it any time I'm asked, but I'm not likely to suggest it as my choice.

tl;dr: an overproduced, more aggressive [thing=23985][/thing]

I always thought [thing=23985][/thing] was an underappreciated design. It is a very clean, streamlined area majority game. Thanks to this new implementation, it gets more attention. Too bad, in my opinion, they made the design less clean and made it more of a conflict game and less of an area majority game.
It is still a very good design, but it does move away from the aspects I respected the most about it.
The minis seem to be there mostly to sell more copies. They are very nice, but I would have preferred wooden pieces. Also, the minis sometimes make it hard to tell what figure you're looking at.
I haven't played Midgard in years, but playing this, I want to try it again.
As for this version: I wouldn't mind playing it again, but there's no way I'm paying for a copy of this version.

Excellent miniatures and terrific art are the frosting on this game, which is a battle for glory. The unpredictable card element of a fantasy board game like Talisman is made more interesting here with a more immediate focus, multiple characters per player (leaders, warriors, sea ships, and monsters), more of a reliance upon strategy, and a board that evolves throughout the three different phases of play. Add to this the GREAT mechanic of self-sacrifice possibly working in a player's favor--and thus, a player's goals shifting mid-game or being hidden from others at first--and the resultant game has a lot of possibilities. This is not an analysis paralysis monster like Mage Knight (my favorite solitaire game alongside Thunderbolt Apache Leader and Perdition's Mouth), but there are often tough choices and gambles to be made.
A couple things are counterintuitive--I'd rather that warriors could not "March" to non-adjacent lands and the term "Invade" is not well chosen for landing new pieces on the board ("Invade" sounds like an action that would occur after a "March")--but these are minor quibbles.
Overall Blood Rage is a really enjoyable game that has some of the immersive qualities of far heavier games while being fast moving, unpredictable, and a very good balance of luck and strategy. (One aside: In every instance that I can recall, the re-pillaging card massively warped the game in the card user's favor. I won't say that this card fully breaks the game--I can think of some theoretical ways around it--but it affects things more than any other card I've seen, by far, and I wish it weren't in mix.)
My favorite board game is Cave Evil while my girlfriend adores Pandemic, and Blood Rage is game that we both have a great time playing together. It is immediate, goal-driven fun and an engaging fantasy with lots of choices and great visuals.

RATING: 8.5
It is a fairly straightforward game. Unlike many of my favorite games, I never find myself reflecting on a game of Blood Rage that I just played wondering "what if I had done that?" or "what if I try such-and-such instead next time?"... I just don't think there is enough meat to the decisions in order to provide the kind of experience that would warrant this kind of reflection afterwards. 

Nonetheless, I love this game! It is a clean design that makes for a smooth playing experience with just enough tension and surprises. What this game lacks in strategic depth it more than makes up for in pure excitement. It is just so damn fun! After the first few games you know exactly what combos there are and the various strategies that exist, but it is still so fun to see how it plays out. I really don't know how to describe it.

NOTE: Everybody seems to think this game is all about the draft. I actually think the draft at the beginning of the round isn't that important. The key to the game lies more with timing. Knowing exactly WHEN to play a card seems more important to me than actually getting some of the supposedly overpowered combos.

Blood Rage has gotten a lot of hype, and usually that makes me less likely to enjoy a game.  But, I was pleasantly surprised by it.  Blood Rage is really hard to classify.  It has area control and awesome miniatures, but also has action point allowance and drafting.  It's kind of a dudes on the map game, but there is so much more to it than just controlling territory.  I often dislike multiplayer area control games because of the politics/kingmaking, but Blood Rage avoids those pitfalls.

I went for a strategy that rewards you for losing battles, and I actually pulled out a solid victory.  I got points for losing battles, points for getting my guys killed, and I was able to place more guys whenever I lost a battle.  The fact that this strategy even exists boosted by rating by a full point.  Everything about the game was enjoyable and I didn't have any complaints.  I could see this rating rising if I get more plays.

UPDATE: My second play of Blood Rage was underwhelming, perhaps because it was only with 3 players.  Once again the strategy of losing battle dominated the game, although this time someone else used it.  There are a lot of great mechanisms put together in this game, but I'm not sure the sum of the mechanisms is something I enjoy.  I'd play it again, but never ask for it.

This game is flawless, and very few games are. I suspected there may be balancing issues in 2 player between different strategies but I haven't found it yet. There is a very modern, unique feel to the mechanics, which mesh with the theme so incredibly well. The idea of losing fights to win is not only interesting and well implemented but also fits so well with the Viking theme and the quest for glory as Ragnarok approaches. The combat is similar to Scythe but even better, with text based abilities. Miniatures look stunning, amazing game.

I can see a decent game in here somewhere, but the mechanics just didn't click with me. The miniatures felt overdone and actually detracted from my experience.  Leaders were mistaken for regular warriors on multiple occasions by different players.  It felt strange that the tracks gave such a large amount of victory points also.  I came in 2nd place in a 3 player game (107 to 102 to 95 pts) scoring 10 of my points from the tracks. Both of my opponents maxed out their tracks for 60 points (more than half of their total points!).

thumbsup - Easy to learn, (almost) always exciting until the last round, a lot of winning strategies, beautiful minis, gameplay 2-2.5 hours with 3-4 players which seems just right;

thumbsdown - Limited number of cards, drafting each age means you can't really plan a strategy, sometimes too dependent on cards you draft, add-ons don't really add a lot. 

Overall very fun game, my friends all like it as all players have a chance to win while tactics still play a decent role. We do play with some "houserules" though (bascially we only found out we played it wrong after 15 or so games but agreed to continue playing it that way).

This game is my favorite game currently. The "combat" reminds me of magic the gathering. The minis are the most detailed and original I've ever seen. If you're not into mini games don't let that turn you off. The minis aren't really necessary to the game play BUT they sure take the theme up to the highest level. This game is a lot more abstract than you would think just glancing at the box. My one gripe is there is a clan that consists only of women. They all are large-breasted with lot's of under-boob showing. We had to censor the artwork slightly to make it more family friendly. (My daughter is a bit of an artist and she did a good job)

Midgard has a special place on my game shelf as the area control game for when there's not enough time for El Grande.  Blood Rage is such a thorough re-implementation that it's hard to remember that they're related.  It's a massive production with tons of different strategies but thoughtful drafting and placement is the key to all of them, just like the original.  Excellent sculpts.

I think Blood Rage stands atop the mountain of bodies in a very competitive sub-genre of 90-120 minute dudes on a map bloodbaths.  This crowded field includes other great titles in recent years such as Kemet, Cyclades, and Cthulhu Wars (which definitely comes in fourth on this list).

What makes Blood Rage reign supreme is two-fold: 1) the card draw before each of the three rounds allows the players to develop and support flexible strategies, and 2) the tight geography and immediacy of conflict leads to plenty of bloodshed.  

The minis are fantastic, too, but all the games listed above have at least equal bragging rights in that department.

RATING: 7.5
This game is a lighter version of Chaos in the old world withthe  most distinct difference being that there are no variable player powers (and of course the altered combat resolution). Which tickles a diferent player styles' fancy! 
In Citow your playstyle is prescripted according to the demon god you get and the associated deck of cards. In Blood Rage you can alter the playstyle to your liking according to the cards you pick in the draft. 
For instance, if you randomly assign roles in Citow and you draw Khorne you have to stick with a very aggressive playstyle to benefit from Khornes power. But there are people who just don't like to play agressive. They love to build up and defend. Others happen to hate this and love direct confrontation. Either way Citow maybe forces you to play in a way you don't enjoy. As said before in Blood Rage you can draft cards according to your "liking" and even change plans in between when you see that a specific route didn't work out.The advantage being that several routes can lead to succes, with the felt disadvantage being that maybe too many routes can lead to success and that in the end your plans - when working out - don't feel rewarding. Nevertheles I think this is a very good game

Early comments.  This game is a bit of a rush--and that can be either good or bad.  The presentation is exceptional--though quite a bit behind what I consider to be the vanguard of presentation in Scythe.  Art/bits are certainly eye catching, though there is a bit of trade off in the small cards and cardstock sideboards and player mats.

But:  gameplay is swift and intense.  Love the myriad of ways to play, but that can also lead to unforeseen surprises (I'm looking at you, Heimdall and Loki), and to well laid plans being laid to waste.  I love it, but I can also see why someone with different play styles or expectations would be lead to dislike the game, or even hate it.

A strange sort of war sim... Vaguely resembles Risk, but with so many exceptions it's maybe unhelpful to describe it as such. While Slow going for new players, it's best feature is experienced play can be fast... Matches can be greased lightning, under 20 min when everyone knows what they're doing... Better for multiple matches in one sitting though, since pull out and tear down is time consuming. Interesting mechanics, win by losing, be awarded for dying, and I always welcome draft mechanics. Really the big problem though is the game is fun, not great, and at 80 dollars, that feels like a waste.

RATING: 7
Will likely play again if offered but I feel like I'd rather play a game of Chaos in the Old World.  My biggest criticism of Blood Rage is that with only three rounds, it it feels hard to come back from an early misstep.  That could be really cool with knowledgeable players, though...

Edit: Three rounds is plenty and some big comebacks are indeed possible.  I think the biggest reason I prefer CitOW is that I've felt it's harder to pursue a coherent strategy throughout the game.  I don't know if I really love the drafting. But, still, would play again.

I have to join in on the unanimous praise for this game. It is excellent and I can't really see any negatives for now. The minis are fantastic, the gameplay is streamlined and simple to learn, a lot of cards feel overpowered but in a fun way. Awesome.

Still not sure where I'll land on Blood Rage versus Chaos in the Old World. CitOW is a solid 10 for me, but Blood Rage cleans up some of the fiddlier parts by just removing them completely (dominance, dial advancements, corruption, event tokens).

This game also has the advantage of playing with different player counts. It seems to be just as good with 3-5 players (skip it with two players). CitOW is really 4 players only, and I wouldn't even recommend the fifth player expansion for that game.

Great game, could possibly be a 10 after more plays.

Update: It's a 10. There's tons of tension in every move and so far it seems like different strategies can win.

I will say that the game definitely seems to be best with four players. Mechanically everything is fine with three players, but with four players you have more people going for different strategies and keeping each other in check.

So far I think that this game and CitOW offer different enough experiences to warrant owning both. Although a lot of the gameplay elements are the same, Blood Rage offers a "choose your own strategy" feeling, where CitOW gives you a strategy from the beginning based on which god you choose.

[b]Player Count Verdict: 3-4[/b]
Just not good with two players. You need players taking different strategies and keeping each other in check for the game to work, so the game is best with four, and good with three. With five it can be a bit long and harder to plan.

Blood Rage rewards any number of strategies in utterly satisfying ways: like winning? Play Tyr cards.  Like losing?  Get glory for every figure returned from Valhalla at the end of the round.  Like sweet monster minis?  Play monsters and invade!  The card drafting lets players both express personality and try to outpick/read opponents.  I'm personally more in it for the fun rather than the heated competition, but either way, my blood is boiling with rage.

I'm conflicted with Blood Rage. I really like games that involve attacking, but are driven by Euro mechanisms. That's Blood Rage. But after the first two plays, I felt it already starting feel a bit samey. I think it comes from the lack of variety in the cards. I had decided to sell it, then I heard the Mystics expansion adds some needed variety. So that's where I'm at. I've got the Mystics expansion now and I need to try it once more with that. We'll see what happens from there.

Were it not for censorship, I'm pretty sure Blood Rage could have been subtitled as, "Blood Rage: No...FUCK YOU!" - by which I mean you are constantly on edge, trying to win a fight or even just survive the goddamn round and escape with some points.  I lost bigtime during my first game, but the spectacle of watching everyone try to KILL DESTROY FOR GLORY is worth experiencing.  Desperately want to try this again and rate accordingly, but first impressions are solid.

There's a lot of game here and a lot of different paths to go down.  The game just works well and plays very smooth.  Dying is actually not a bad thing, which is very refreshing.  Great minis, solid rules, easy to learn, very reasonable play time.  Probably doesn't scale down to 2-3 too well, but that's no fault of the game.

At first glance I was like "oh another chromed out KS title, with a viking theme that will probably have mediocre mechanics, balance issues and incomplete rules".  But I was definitely wrong, very solid game.

I really enjoy Blood Rage. Although it can have big changes in points, this adds to my enjoyment of the game as it can allow a trailing player to stay in the game through clever play using an alternative path to victory such as getting all of your dudes killed and scoring that way. Definitely better at higher player counts (4, 5) as I find in a 3 player game it is more difficult to reign in the first age leader. As with many "plastic men on cardboard" this is group dependent. Can be cleverly strategic but benefits from a group willing to interact with table talk and curtailing the leader. 
For new players it takes some time to learn the card combos when drafting. I usually point out several of the paths to victory, especially that a player can win by both successfully pillaging and by getting their figures killed and sent to Valhalla. 
Definitely recommend, have played this 15-20 times at all player counts.

This game has pushed previous favourites down, or even completely off, my shelf. Game of Thrones and Kemet used to see a lot more plays before I got my hands on Blood Rage. I'd definitely say it has replaced Game of Thrones for me, while I still see chances to play Kemet. 

This game just nails everything for me. From the viking theme, the amazing minis (that have found their way into my D&D campaigns) to the mix of Euro (get points) and American-style (fight) games. The drafting definitely pushes this game up; I love the mechanic as it allows for on-the-fly strategizing and gives you a chance to mess with your opponents.

I had heard this game was the hotness, but it didn't really capture my interest. It's a direct conflict game and it's all about the miniatures, two things that don't really sell a game for me.

My play was colored by the fact that the rules explanation was all over the place. Some things were explained partially, then we'd switch to a new topic and only later would we finish the first part. Rules kept appearing with a "Oh, I forgot... one more thing". And another thing that colored the play for me was that the player explaining the game had played before and had memorized the cards, while the other two players were new.

The game has some interesting bits. It's essentially and area control-ish type of thing, where there's competition to be able to trigger fights in areas to get bonuses, which usually increase you ability to have more units on the board, get Vp's from fights, or take more actions. There's a draft before each of the three rounds, which factors into your ability to do things.

My main complaints about the game was that as a new player, you're at a disadvantage not knowing the cards, or how the game really works. And some of the cards seem really overpowered. There was one in particular that allowed a player to place a free unit whenever he brought a unit in that really seemed wonky.

It was interesting, but seemed to have some flaws, and wasn't really my thing.

It's not painful to play, so that's great.

A number of issues though. It seems like a game about conquering the map, but players seem reluctant to engage in battles they could lose; battles seem to mostly happen because as a defender you can't retreat units when somebody picks a fight.

The engine building is simple and doesn't seem to offer a lot of strategies. It also seems to create runaway leaders, partly because nobody sees it as a good idea to sacrifice their own plans just to make trouble for the leader.

The sense that the map matters is weakened by the unit movement action, which allows teleporting anywhere. Though, when someone starts an attack somewhere, other players have the option of moving in units from adjacent regions only.

So chances are if you're reading reviews about Blood Rage you kind of already know you want it. Admit it. Deep down the decision has already been made.

What you get in the box is the good kind of ridiculous. The minis by CMON are some of the best I've ever seen. Ever. The monsters are INCREDIBLE. It's so hard to pass up the chance to claim them in the game because few things feel better than clicking one of these beasties into your clan's ring and smashing it down onto the table. I wish I was talented enough to paint them in a way that would do them justice because hot. Damn. 

I really quite like Blood Rage's take on area control too, because everything is so fast and crazy and disposable. There isn't any turtling or slow play, because dagnabbit you're vikings and vikings wanna smash things and die gloriously. And with the scoring mechanics focusing on this idea, rounds can fly by blazingly fast. It is very rare for you to feel too upset about losing a battle due to the (sometimes broken) battle cards because:
a) every card and upgrade in this game feels equally, gloriously broken and
b) your units come back from Valhalla before you can say Yggdrassil. And they will probably score you points for doing so.

I've found that in most games under 4 players somebody unfortunately is wailed-on and put at *too* much of a disadvantage to really come back and challenge for the win. But Blood Rage is so fast and fun that this usually doesn't mar the experience too much.

It has been a tough call for me to choose between this and Inis as my favourite gorgeous-area-control-and-card-drafting game, but after many plays and much deliberation I am leaning more towards Inis as being the better of the two. 

But like I said, you know you already want this game. Come on.

A really slick design from Eric Lang, one of my favorite designers! Drafting and putting combos together is gonzo fun. Some might be put off by the fact that this miniatures game is secretly a card game, but as an MTG kid, I love it.  I probably wouldn't love it if play time clocked in any longer, but it's breezily short.  Unfortunately, the whole thing is a little marred by the sexist aesthetics.

This game looks pretty cool, if a bit too tilted in the hack-and-slash direction (though I could be totally wrong about that judgment, since I've never played). I like the religious component quite a bit: just looking at the board feels holy to me.

What makes this area-control game so good is that in each of the three ages you have specific goals which can acheive bonus points. As such, people new to the game have a guide for what to do, and experienced players could vary their goals to try something different.

Awesome minis matched with a game that is simple and not very challenging.  The drafting phase is just a placeholder to create an illusion of control in an otherwise random game without much substance or focus.  I would play it with casuals, drinking beer and talking Viking trash.  However, any competitive group will ruin the experience by thinking out optimum moves and making the game last 2 hours.  There is nothing here to keep me interested (even drunk) for more than an hour.  This may be one of the most overrated games on bgg.

Wow, is this a tough game to rate. I really like Chaos In The Old World (without the expansion), so I expected to LOVE this. After all, the gameplay is largely similar to CITOW, but with drafting (a mechanic I love), scalability (CITOW should only be played with 4) and flexibility (no need adhering to a fixed strategy depending on the god you play). My first game of it was great, but also a little disappointing. Casual gamers found it to be harder than CITOW, because they found it hard to assess the relative worth of the cards going round. On top of that, the game feels more luck dependent, as some of the cards seem really strong and allow for some incredible combos. And since there are only three drafting rounds, it can be really hard to catch up with the leader after the first Valhalla fase. Finally, I personally found that the third round was not as interesting as the first two, as there was less to do with the shrinking board - cards get more powerful, but also more expensive. However, I still like the game and think it looks gorgeous - so I am curious to find out how my next game will go.

RATING: 9
One of my all-time favorite games. The card drafting phase provides a great deal of tension as you try to balance the cost of allowing another great card slip into the hands of your opponents. The combat phase itself allows for a lot of room for decision making, and every turn feels just as impactful as the other. The way conflict is handled also allows for mind games, and Blood Rage makes it so that even losing can have its perks. That being said, certain aspects of Blood Rage can be very swingy, and a few cards feel significantly better than others leading to a small imbalance that nullifies certain strategies. That being said, I love Blood Rage, and I look forward to playing many more games in the future.

I like this but I'm not carried away by it. I own a copy of Midgard and like that almost as much if not more than Blood Rage. The minis are nice but the game doesn't really need them - they are splurge chrome for sure. There are balance issues with some of the monsters and add-on product.

Cool and interesting game. After a drafting round, you have the opportunity to spend "rage" for actions such as occupy a territory or plunder. Winner is the player with the most victory points at the end of the game.
The first plays were a lot better but I reckon that the replayability is just not given in this game because it is very obvious that some cards are extremely stronger than other ones. That has the negative effect of predicting the winner of the game.
Aside from that, the game is pretty enjoyable although it is quite repetitive in its actions, in the end there is not much variability.
After all I would still recommend this since I am the only one in my "gamer circle" which is fed up with this, the others still enjoy it :)

A war game that's not all about randomness and various player-targeting problems.

Initial rating, may rise or fall some with further plays.  Time will tell if the game feels played out at some point.  Definitely a game that hits it home with me.  I miss the feeling of area control and tech building some... This game is almost purely attacking, but there are a TON of tactics and strategy to your actions.

My big complaint is how swingy the game is, you really  never have any idea who is winning as someone can come out of nowhere with 60-80 points on any age.  It's also perhaps a bit too crazy? Not as crazy as Cosmic Encounter, you can learn what the power moves are, but it can be really hard to guess what your opponent is up to.  The game can be really punishing if you make one bad move so it's almost stressful in that way to the point where it's almost stressful to play.  You might have a set of actions in your hand, a plan in your head, suddenly places are getting ransacked faster than you expected, there's no time to do everything you wanted to do! Tough decisions is the name of this game, to a painful degree.

Overall very enjoyable still... the combo's just don't quite come together as exciting for me as in other games.

RATING: 5
An impressive feat of game design, with neat minis, but I simply didn't find it very compelling.  All-or-nothing combat resolution systems like this one usually lead to pile-on-the-leader slugfests that devolve into horrendously long drags, but this game neatly avoids the problem by giving a lot of incentive to move around and cards that progressively get better as the game moves along.  It's a tough problem to solve, and the fact that this game has done so is admirable.  But then I'm left pretty cold by the whole experience.  The theme here is supposedly viking, but the execution of the thematic flourishes feels like it could be set in any of a number of other generic universes.  Euros have gotten flak for Egypt=Italy=Netherlands=... themes with no real difference, but it's getting to the point where Ameritrash is falling into the same traps, but instead with Viking=Fantasy=Warhammer=... themes.  I'm not going to insist on something else if this comes out, but I'm not super excited to play it either.

It would take some convincing for me to play this game again. I vehemently dislike the style of drafting this game uses; I would much rather craft my strategy based on a menu of options available to everyone instead of making the best of my opponents' scraps. To me, this game brings nothing new to the table compared to, for example, Kemet, so I see no need to include it in my collection or in my regular rotation.

Completely broken game.

Affetto da PDP Petty Diplomacy Problem e da meccanismi di recupero inefficaci, Gioco godibile ma il draft delle carte è una meccanica inefficace con tutte queste carte sbilanciate che rovinano il gioco.
si potrebbe pensare a un livello di gioco introduttivo dove si creano dei kit di carte  per i giocatori e far decidere loro quando giocarle. e magari dare dei punti per le carte non giocate.

Tra i Kickstarter usciti recenti  sicuramente meglio di Trickerion

The gameplay is excellent, only takes 1-1.5 hours with little downtime, but chock full of strategy and different ways to win. There are so many fun monsters and upgrades you can use to your advantage and I laughed when my first win was through dieing and going to Valhalla at the right time.

I haven't drank the BR Kool-Aid like so many others here on BGG.  Blood Rage definitely has a "cool factor" with the gorgeous minis, fast gameplay, and ridiculously overpowered everything.  As far as "dudes on a map" games are concerned, it's one of the better ones.  That being said, Blood Rage isn't all that deep.  It has serious runaway leader problems.  And the combat (a central part of the game) is really underwhelming.  Blood Rage is a game that I like if I'm in the right mood, but don't love.

As we all know from the Nordic mythology and sagas, the vikings invented the drafting mechanism now widely used in many board and card games as the way to divide the spoils from their raids. So very appropriately, card drafting is the core mechanism which drives the epic, build your own special powers engine dudes on a map game that is Blood Rage.

Over three ages players have to make agonising decisions to choose between the many cool special powers and quests to put together an efficient combat engine. The viking clans and their house-trained giant monsters then slug it out for glory in the provinces around Yggdrasil while the whole world is falling apart in Ragnarok. "We need a bigger Valhalla". The casualties pile up high in Valhalla, often with a sneaky happy grin on their players' faces as they wanted them to be slaughtered in battle for the glory of being resurrected from Valhalla at the end of each age.

Very good, in your face confrontational game with lots of hard choices to be made throughout and with great miniatures (bigatures?/maxiatures?). Highly recommended Eurotrash game. Definitely a keeper to sit proudly next to Kemet and Cyclades.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
'Blood Rage' is an excellent game, themed on the Norse gods' final battle with the giants of Jontheim and the God of Mischief; Loki. Each player takes on the role of one of up to four clans who are vying to improve their prestige, through earned glory (victory points), by conquest and strategy. The clans start with a leader and four warriors, and can utilise these in a number of ways using rage as the resource to do so, which along with glory and horns, are the three abilities that need to be increased to achieve more glory. There are three turns, consisting of card selection, actions including battle and pillaging, and finally Ragnarok itself. Players take one of eight cards at the beginning of each turn, selecting one and then passing the balance on to the player to their left, until the final two for each player are placed in the discard deck. Any unused cards, during the turn are also discarded, bar one, before the next selection round apart from turn three of course at the end of which Ragnarok is well and truly here! The cards contain things such as battle bonuses from allies, clan upgrades, like improved combat effectiveness, monsters, quests and ship upgrades. Most of these have rage point costs, that must be paid to acquire, being then placed in the clan player board (homeland). There are several realms surrounding Yggdrasil, and one of these is destroyed by placement of a Ragnarok counter, and three more of these will be destroyed in each of the three turns, in accordance with the predetermined draw. This needs to be watched, as players may not necessarily want their forces to be destroyed in the cataclysm!, although certain cards actually encourage this as bonus glory can be earned for this and/or retrieving warriors from Valhalla right at the end of each turn. When cards are utilised subsequently, the rage cost must be paid, and bear in mind (as I failed to do on one occasion), that quests must all be placed before the clan rage pool is exhausted. There are no limits, apparently, to the number of quests that may be placed, although having these does limit options in other areas such as clan upgrades! Gaining higher levels of rage, glory and horns yields glory at the end of the game. I should comment that raising glory increases the glory earned in each battle that is fought and horns increase the number of warriors (there is a maximum of eight) and/or your one leader and/or your one ship that can be placed. in the game we played, Endof Supercycle won following the strategy of sending and retrieving warriors from the halls of Valhalla whereas Rod Chapman collected bonus glory for ending the game with all of his pieces on the table. Both of these were generated by specific clan upgrades which can be played to any clan so long as the player has drawn the card in the first instance. There were no KRO's and the game was well explained by Jim Boardgames. I would make only two observations and that would be that when a pillage attempt is made, each player in turn sequence declares if one of their clan (only those in adjacent realms) wishes to invade. (The number of invading pieces is limited by the number of available unoccupied spaces). And secondly, when any upgrade card is played, each player confirms what it is once, as it is difficult and delays the game if players have to lean over and inspect cards each time they are about to take an action. Should they then forget later, tough cheddar! On further reflection, I wasn't sure why there was a limitation on potential realm spaces as there are none for Yggdrassil itself and each clan is still limited by their overall clan size as mentioned before. I wasn't clear why ships could not move after placement and would be looking for an explanation from the game designer although the expansion(s) may change this arrangement perhaps. Nevertheless, it didn't detract from my enjoyment, even though I gained least glory, and was last. That's the difference between a good and poor game in my view.

Epic. Played several 2 player games and loved it. Had some friends over for a 4 player game and we were blown away.

Blood Rage delivers a simple yet immersive experience that so far no other game in my collection has matched.

After a couple of games I ve found that this game is so limited in strategies and very card driven. It´s a card game with miniatures to resume with a few words. 
 The game has a counter intuitive style when sometimes (with the cards that allow it) you have to loose battles or complete easy objetives that have a minor interaction between players (control of zones).

RATING: 8.6
It is so elegant and simple really, but still provides that epic feeling you should get of a game of this size. Card drafting is one of my favourite mechanics, and the 7 wonders style drafting works well here. It's tough decision making, but no matter what cards you get when you draft, you can always try to make some sort of strategy out of it. I try not to think of this as an area control game, more of a victory point grabbing game, where you try to maximize your return of your actions. One problem with the game, it can suffer from a runaway leader problem. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Played a few times. What I like: there is good decision angst, both in the card drafting and action phases. What I don't like: there's just too many vp opportunities flying around. I was hoping there'd be more interaction with players fighting over scraps; instead, I've found the game too self-involved as players are more attentive to the card combos in their hands than each other. There's just too many cards of the "score x points for having y" variety, e.g. in my last game I drafted a card that gave me 12 VP if my boat was destroyed. Getting the boat destroyed was a trivial, uninteresting task that got me beaucoup points without any prior planning or overarching strategy. That's how much of the game starts to feel: why bother guessing which scoring card the other guy has and trying to stop it when you've got your own scoring card to fulfill.

Played with 4. Fun game. I think we mostly had fun pronouncing the Norse names with a Swedish accent rather than playing the game. So far we've had a runaway leader problem. I prefer games with a victory condition rather than VPs in a set amount of rounds. It helps to solve that problem IMO.

A prettier, more exciting version of Midgard, Eric Lang's 2007 Z-man release. It plays pretty much the same, except that there is a bigger focus on combat and the entire game has been reconfigured to accentuate that. It's hard not to love the new version, as the miniatures are tremendously well done and the whole production pops, especially when compared to the quaint wooden pawns and one dimensional decision making of the original.

Still, while I think it is more engaging than the original, I'm not sure it has legs. The decks from which you draft cards are tiny in number, which means you see the exact same cards almost every game. That may be a positive for game balance, but it sure seems like it will get repetitive after a few plays. There is also a degenerate tactic (at least it feels that way) of shoveling guys into the doomed Raganarok spaces, just to convert them into almost instant points. While marching off to Ragnarok is thematically appropriate, it feels cheap to intentionally avoid battles in order to gain better position for a mass suicide.

I can't in any way say this is a bad game, but I will say there are too many counter-thematic "gamey" moves for me to ever consider it a good one. Maybe if I was a painter, my opinion could be swayed a bit. I have to say the miniatures are fantastic. I suppose the gameplay is good enough, when it's all said and done.

As long as you follow last suggestions the game is totally fun.

While Chaos is the Old World is Lang's most thematically integrated design, I think the simpler nature of Blood Rage might make it his best. This is a fantastic game as an alternate to those people who think that pulling out Risk is a good idea.

I feared that this game was overhyped, but it's actually really good and, most importantly, involving and enjoyable. The rules are streamlined and elegant, it's very easy to understand all the basics and just start to play. I'm a little bit concerned about the long-term replayability of this game, but so far so good.

Another great thing about Blood Rage is that unlike many area control games it works very well with every player count (it's good with 2, great with 3 and amazing with 4!). And it packs all that intense action into a 60-90 minute gaming session. What's not to like here?

Numerous unique and fun mechanics. Drafting your action cards at the beginning of the turn is dynamic and allows for fascinating strategic depth (beware of players trying to kill themselves!). Combat is very well done, as it serves to gain advantages in life and death, so you must pay attention to each player's goals and whether or not fighting is a good idea. Of course the artwork is beautiful and the material is of outstanding quality.

Card drafting, tons of combat, no dice, monsters and awesome minis. The hybrid of the 'beat em up' from ameritrash but with the no-luck attitude of euro's is my favorite. It will take a few more plays before I can say with confidence that none of the cards are too powerful, but as of now this game is amazing.

RATING: 8
Despite the amount of plastic, this is a solid Euro, not an Ameritrash game.  

It sits on the frame of an area control game with a lot of color added in.

In the same weight class as Fire & Axe.

I really don't know what all of the hubbub is for the kickstarter BS.  I'm not sure I want expansions for this.  They are likely to just mess up a fine game.

In many ways, Blood Rage feels like a spiritual successor to Chaos in the Old World. This shouldn't really be that surprising when you realize that Eric Lang designed both games.

In that regard, Blood Rage stands out above CitOW for me because of some of the new elements that it adds. Players now draft hands of cards at the start of each round. Combat is driven by a Cosmic Encounter-like card system instead of dice. Players will have a variety of methods for gaining victory points depending on the cards they drafted, which will skew the way they deploy their troops to the board.

Blood Rage also keeps several of the interesting facets of CitOW: alternate routes to victory, upgrading your army, area control and keeping your opponents in check.

Blood Rage is also more flexible in player count than CitOW. 4 is probably still best but the game still works fine with 3 and even pretty well with 2 players.

Blood Rage does what a good spiritual sequel should and being built on a game that is solid to begin with only makes it great.

I had tried to play Blood Rage once before, but called it because of some botched rules after the first age. So, I was pretty excited when a friend of mine was coming in from out of town to play some games, so another friend of mine came over and I setup Blood Rage.

I’d love to give a play-by-play, but my memory is terrible, however I’ll try to give a general gist of how I played. I managed to draft the clan upgrade that allows you to play a warrior for free whenever you place another figure in a region. Later, I got the warrior upgrade that makes a pair of them worth 3 strength, so I had that synergy. In addition, I also had the clan upgrade that gave me points for figures released from Valhalla, so dying was no longer a big concern. I combined that with the quest to have a certain number of figures in Valhalla to pull out the win.

I love games with asymmetry, whether that’s built-in from the start with games like Chaos in the Old World or whether it’s earned over the course of the game like in Kemet or Blood Rage. The added wrinkle of drafting those differences and trying to create interesting combinations was a lot of fun, and I’m surprised no one had tried it before.

I’m happy I backed this one on Kickstarter and I look forward to playing it a lot more in the future.

Highly recommended if you enjoy confrontational games.

I like this game a lot. It is a minis game, but the mechanisms and play are very well defined. There are three ages of the game with several phases each. First there is a drafting round. Next, there is an action phase when plays can upgrade characters, place characters onto the board, establish goals, and pillage provinces. Finally, goals are evaluated, another province is destroyed, and any destroyed figures are released from Valhalla. The game plays well and the minis look really cool. The only thing is now I need to learn to paint minis.

Tagline says it all "Life is Battle, battle is glory". Three ages of card drafts and throw down for area control and quick strike loot raids. Invading and pillaging and recycling from Valhalla. A liberal move mechanic makes confrontation abundant and unpredictable. Like all card drafts, picking and preventing the right powers and quests takes awhile to get right. Normally too interactive for me but since everyone is kicking everyone elses butt...what the hey.  Be frugal spending rage. Don't be the first to burn out or they will walk all over you.

Review Date: May 2017

Disclaimers for context:I play with the retail available expansions and without. I do not own the kickstarter content

Positives: The models, some of the best out there and once painted make the game a joy to watch/play. The variety of playing styles, it encourages participation whether you win or lose! It is easy to learn but has depth to master. It can vary tremendously using the Gods expansion. 

Negatives:  Experienced players will run over new players until they learn the combos of cards and strategies. Runaway victories are possible. Sometimes forced to hate draft to stop opponents dominating. Some criticize the female models gratuitous clothing 

Conclusion: Excellent card drafting area control game with a real well developed theme and components

Score 9 if you like the battle cry on the way to Valhalla!

I think Blood Rage deserves to be as popular as it is.  There is plenty of strategic depth to be had and lots of fun to be extracted through experimenting with and adapting different strategies.  Wonderful moments of tension can culminate in dramatic surprises in the epic battles which tend to unfold in the Yggdrasil province.  People that suck at strategic combat can even pull out decisive victories by losing on purpose, thanks to the Loki card realm.  As is common knowledge, the production values are top notch, and the theme is fun, well represented, and synergizes well with the gameplay.  

That all being said, the game definitely has some flaws.  The drafting mechanic has little strategy to it beyond "grab the cards that fit MY strategy, if possible, faster than anyone else does," with the only curve ball being "this card doesn't really fit my strategy but I feel I have to take it so that the next player doesn't get to capitalize on it."  Players can also be steamrolled if they fall significantly behind on their "Rage" stat and simply don't have the economy to take as many actions as other players later in the game.  

Despite its flaws, Blood Rage deserves a place in history as one of the best "dudes on a map" games, and a place on your shelf as a game which will most likely be enjoyable for all players that enter your home, new and veteran alike.

It's OK in a 7 wonders way. Cards get passed around and you try to get the best pairings of strategically complimentary abilities that others aren't competing in. Then you play them to move plastic around the map (with combat a bit like the game of thrones boardgame) deciding which leading opponents you want to butt heads with. You also get some fun tech tracks to raise. It plays lightning fast. Like most of these card passing games you fight more against what randomness gives you than each other making this a safe game for those who are combat averse, but also failing to have as great a punch if its direct competition you are looking for.

I find other games where strategies you select to pursue are not dependent on random factors but player design vastly superior. In the end what you have here is a single hand of poker that takes two hours to play.

Initial rating is tentative to more plays

RATING: 9
Ill break my commentary down based on the player counts Ive had:

2 player: Had 2 games at two players, didnt mind it at two but both plays had a clear runaway winner, but both games at this count were learning games one for me and the other for someone I introduced the game to. Still feels pretty competitive at 2 and games are usually about a hour or so in length decent at this maybe a few more players would be better..

5 Player:  Absolute carnage and chaos, especially in the later ages, the first age saw a lot of the players take early pillages to get the stat pumps and try to avoid incursions, most of the first age was a ramp up to the last two where it was almost kemet like with players decimating each other for vps and pillage blocks. It is Much harder to pillage in the later ages of the game if you dont have a significant force, and getting multiple pillages is doable but maybe more of a pipe dream. The game took a very long time though at this player count so I feel maybe one less player would be ideal, but I wont turn down a game with 5 in the future.

A great area majority game with high interaction. The theme is strong and highly integrated, and the minis are the best in the business. Is it worth the price? For someone like me who enjoys high quality minis and enjoys painting, yes it is. 

Also, the game play is short enough and strong enough.

In the end, it's the card draft that takes this game from great to excellent. Coupled with the minis, and it's a 10.

UPDATE: Two player is surprisingly fun.

Very solid mashup or Euro and conflict mechanics. Blood Rage takes a lot of parts from many different games and blends them well.

Excellent area control game ... but I have one big problem with it. Intentionally throwing battles or picking fights you can't win is a perfectly viable strategy. That's what I ended up doing due to the hand of cards I had going into round 2. I won, which was cool, but it seems wrong to win an area control game by losing every single battle you force yourself into. It wasn't enough to dock points for it, but it is something worth mentioning. Anyway, component quality is excellent and the miniatures are awesome, especially the monsters.

A friend brought Blood Rage over for our regular games night and it was a very strange gaming experience. I lost a battle early in the 1st Age, which didn't seem like a problem until I realised that that one battle had basically knocked me out of the game. Don't get me wrong, I tried my best to get back into it, but all my efforts were futile and served only to ensure that my last place points tally wasn't too far behind the other players. My game was in marked contrast to the player that won, who was racking up huge scores for fun, despite not having done a great deal more than anyone else to earn the points. I'm not sure what this game is supposed to be, or who it's supposed to be aimed at. The gameplay seems quite limited and it doesn't make a great deal of sense thematically: the chrome really only serving to hide what is, at heart, a pretty basic area control game with a weak combat mechanic layered on top. After playing I checked on BGG and was quite surprised to see that it's ranked 23. I thought it was fairly poor and with a bit of tweaking could have climbed up to 'okay', but in no way could it be described as the 23rd best game in existence. It's certainly not in my top 23 and probably wouldn't make it into my top 23 games with blood in the title.

A good competitive game, some nice opportunities for sly, underhanded play. Not sure it has staying power though, I'm a little tired of it after only 3 plays...

Great game. Perfect card engine to fuel the various actions players can take over the course of the game. I like the fact everybody is involved at all time, which makes for a shared experience. Game is aesthetically beautiful, cards are all interesting, monsters are great etc. Maybe geared towards gamers who like conflicts and everchanging board states, but can also satisfy the less agressive gamer trying to fulfill his quests. I love the Loki side of the game, and the Valhalla/Ragnarök earning you points, so to me this game is full of opportunities to do something cool.

The most plastic minis you'll see in a euro game. Love the drafting and how each player starts out the exact same but become completely different by the end based on what powers and monsters they took.

Blood Rage is pretty fun if you like swingy power combos, amazing miniatures and all or nothing combat.  It felt a lot like a less fiddly Kemet to me... and that is a good thing!

Played once. Its alright. Its not a game I would play unless in the mood.  I felt considering the cost vs compared to the length of the game and the stuff you get to do in the game is poor.  

Decisions aren't really all that interesting, at least for me.  I liked the area control aspect, the battles are quick, and the game itself plays very quick.

I'm just not sure if its for me.

I've only logged one play but it wasn't a very good experience.  I respect the attempt: the figures are awesome, the ability to recruit monsters and upgrade your warriors is great, and the Norse mythology theme is terrific.  

But Blood Rage does little to solve the problems inherent to all targeted-attack games: Player A expends resources effing up Player B, and Players C and D are the ultimate winners of the exchange.  That's just not fun for me no matter which of those four players I am.  Plus it incentivizes politicking and whining.

Finally got to play this. Must say I'm seriously underwhelmed. Didn't do too poorly -- came in 2nd I think. But the winner ran away with it courtesy of Dark Elf + Tyr's Challenge and racking up 60pts on the Rage/Axes/Horns stat via Ygdrassil.

I found the game rather boring. I'll give it another go just to ensure it wasn't just the fact it was the first game. But having played it I can't see why anyone would play this more than 4 or 5 times. There's just not much "game" there. Once you know the powerful (perhaps broken?) combinations of cards, then that person will run away with it. Where's the joy in that? One might argue that once everyone is equal in terms of knowledge everyone will have sufficiently "broken" combos that it balances out, but luck of the draw typically doesn't work that way. It's more likely one of the players will get a broken set resulting in too much power and that person wins. Maybe now and again two would get similarly equally powerful and broken sets, but that would be rare. 

And I fail to understand what the justification is in being able to move everything except your boat. It makes zero sense. The boat goes to a fjord and is stuck there. Stupid. 

I personally think the only reason this game has the popularity it has is the minis. And minis do nothing for me, so I concentrate on the game. And there's not much game here.

Nekem tetszett, de gyorsan tegyük hozzá, hogy

1.) a gyönyörűen festett minik rengeteget dobtak rajta
2.) a vége fele eléggé leült a dolog, némelyik játékosnál nagyon látszódott, h esélyük sincs már...

ettől függetlenül szeretnék még majd vele játszani.

Nagyon tetszett a második játék, még kicsit jobban is, mint az első. Végig szorosnak tűnt, persze aztán a legvégén elég nagy különbségek lettek. De ezzel együtt is izgalmas és jó volt, ráadásul gyorsan le is ment. Nekem tetszett a 3fős játék, még talán jobban is, mint többen, de nyilván egy ilyen játéknál az a jó, ha minél nagyobb harc megy a területekért.

After 1 Play: I'm not generally a fan of multiplayer combat games, but this one holds some interest because of the various paths to victory.  I think the level of chaos is a bit high for the length of the game, but I'd like to play it again.

I love the drafting with the varied strategy and really like the fun created by the minis and the confrontation. Really my kind of games. Recommend it to anybody. Can't see when I will sell it to somebody. Will be in my collection for a very long time.

An good area control game. Best part is the drafting and building up your tableau / clan. After 5 plays I think the balance between the cards is ok. It's definately better with 4 than with 3, as you get the typical 2 fight against each other, one profits situation. 

Plays well with 5 too. 

This game is a successor to Chaos in the Old World, though I think Citow is still the better game of the two.

So few games, it seems, can provide both a thematic, engaging experience, *and* lots of tight, balanced mechanisms. Blood Rage does it.

The production of the game is also fantastic, with solid artwork and amazing plastic miniatures. 

I can see this one appealing to lots of folks. Check it out.

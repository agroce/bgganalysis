We had a load of fun playing this and laughed loads. But I think that was more because Debs couldn't understand what orthogonally meant. Despite it being explained about twenty times.

RATING: 4
A combination of a bidding and a set collection game although the theme (build your own zoo) dresses it up quite well. Like most auction games, to play really well you should try and assess the value of each tile to your opponent. In this game I have enough trouble trying to work it's value to me let alone worrying about anyone else. Play for fun otherwise too much of a brainburner (and there are much better games that will burn your brain)

Had my first game at lunch time.  It plays well, slight positive feedback problem in if you don't have any tiles you don't get any more money so you can't overbid first up.  It is rated an 8 now, but I suspect this will quickly drop to 7 with more plays.  Good fun, and nice zooey theme with no conflict would make it great for my son - when he stops chewing everything he's given...

It's Carcassonne meets Princes of Florence, meets Zig-Zag meets Metro.  I really like it.  The artwork, except on the box is brill as are all the little pieces which are designed specifically to appeal to kids, though they also appeal to adults too.  Don't be led to think that this is a kids' game because there's lots to think about here.  Lots of tension as the game gets into the last two rounds when you have to think about scoring benches more and that makes your placements tough.  You also have to work out how you can stop other players.  I like the sliding scoring method too.  All in all, a smashing product!  I'd advise anyone in the English speaking world to get the Zoch version as it's the same game but cheaper and with multi-lingual rules.

I like the auction mechanism, the scoring and the beautiful art work.  
I am glad my daughter can get all aspects of this game.  
At first she just paid anything to get the animals she wanted.
After 5-10plays, she is much more clever about the game.  It does help that she is an animal lover.

A nice auction game.  The closed-fist bidding is more skill than luck because the players who don't win the bid take back their money.  Placement of the tiles is an interesting puzzle, on par with Alhambra.  The game plays smoothly with the new "O Zoo le Mio" version, which has colored meeples and nice trees and benches; I could see that the old "ZooSim" version would have a problem without those nice bits.  (Not only is it confusing, it feels much more satisfactory to look at your zoo with many colored meeples and trees and benches.)  The rumored "rich gets richer" problem happens only with novices; the money system is IMO well-designed.

Very good blind bidding game that plays fast and incorporates many nice decisions. Can be played as a light family game or with more thought (and downtime) as a nice low luck gamers game. Don't underestimate the need to keep track of what everyone else has in their zoo. Also has an interesting scoring system where the game has a fairly constant number of points available and they just get shuffled around from player to player. This adds a lot to the game since you not only have to think about how many points you may be able to get each round but also how many you will likely lose and to whom! 

To simplify scoring I created a scoring sheet (ZooSim Scoring Sheet.doc). This sheet does away with the visitor meeples and makes it easier to see where everyone is in stars relative to each other. I did this because one of the big downtime factors in this game is that everyone would sit around and constantly count the stars in each animal category in all the zoos. This way you can see at a glance where you sit relative to everyone else. Big time saver.

Juego bastante atractivo, muy portable y con cierta miga pese a su aparente sencillez. Subastas secretas y colocación de losetas. No es lo mejor de su género pero da lugar a partidas entretenidas y con cierta tensión.

RATING: 7
First, the negatives: the box art is kinda garish, and so are SOME of the tiles. The zoo centres, I suspect, will break down over time; and it takes some ingenuity to store it all back in the box. There are many things to consider in auctions, and so analysis paralysis can be a problem for some people.
Now, the positives: a cool and cruel auction game! There is a steep strategic learning curve that is very hard to master. It's basically Carcassonne for the hard-core strategy gamer. In spite of the cutesy theme and fairly simple rules, I definitely would not recommend it for children under 10: I'm 42, and I cried gallons! NOTE: It sure would help with the tile placement if you've played classic dominoes before; I haven't, and so it took me a while to catch on to the dominoes-like tile placing rules.

Played the first time with three players and it left a "lacking" feeling for everyone.  I'm going to try and play this with four next time to see if it's better.
(Updated - MUCH better with 4.  The huts are still to damn small... :) )

Also, if you have big hands, trying to fish out your money from behind the little "zoo huts" is annoying.  Everyone ended up holding their money in their lap...

Really didn't like this, even though I generally like bidding and also like games with sharks. Felt like there wasn't enough gradients to the bidding, and I wasn't sure I understood the tile placement rules, so I was never sure if I should be bidding higher or not.

Solid game but hard to teach appropriate bidding.  Unfortunately a game or two are needed to teach this and since players are punished for bad bidding the first game, it's hard to get that second game going.  It's too bad, this is a nice game.

Cute game. You need to be fairly aggressive with bidding in order to obtain the exhibit tiles you need. Being able to think spatially by imagining the best orientation for a tile before bidding is required or you won't be able to combine exhibits effectively to maximize points.

{1 play • 4 players} Even though I bid terribly (by the end of the 3rd round, I had only 2 tiles!), I really like this one, though I can see it being one of those games we "play out".. and then it doesn't come off the shelf much.

i like it, but i've probably played enough of it.  the rgg o zoo le mio production is infinitely better than the cwali tube because of the decent box and superior bits, including treeples!  i think the fixed income variant is an absolute must, otherwise it can become a gross rich-get-richer thing right after the first round.  unique dominoes kinda flavor.

None of us could wait for this game to be over. Zooloretto does this oh so much better. A game with such charming components and theme should be a lot more fun than this. Glad it was just borrowed!

RATING: 7
A surprising little game that initially appears simplistic (maybe due to zoo theme) but is actually a top rate connection, majorities, and auction game.  The order of the tiles appearance for purchase can lead to some creative replanning of players' exhibit paths.  Since each tile has two exhibits on it, a skilled player can create 'sneak attack' opportunities to snag an exhibit majority.  Game is visually appealing and playable by many, including serious gamers.  Worth playing.  [GTI Code: TGSL]

Own Zoosim. Very nice game that mixes bidding and dominos tile laying. It's a very smart way to teach about investing. New players can get caught early in the game with bad bids; so I recommend explaining that and even going through the motion at least once with them to make that first game a positive experience.

Well-themed blind auction game that generally rewards aggressive play. Don't let yourself get behind on income. Definitely a rich-gets-richer (momentum) game. Not what I would consider flawed but you certainly have to take it into consideration when playing the game. I'd personally rather play most other auctions games (Ra, Mogul, TraumFabrik) but this is an excellent gateway auction game.

A szabály alapján kifejezetten tetszett, ötletes lapkalerakós-licites játéknak tűnt. Aztán játszva... nos ritka rosszul ment:) Úgy tűnik nagyon nem nekem van kitalálva, de azért még egy próbát tennék.

Az volt az érzésem, hogy ha valaki elhúz a 2.-3. körben, az behozhatatlan, mivel a játék a nagyobb állatkertet segíti a kör eleji jövedelemmel, nincs kiegyenlítő mechanizmus...

Azért a kivitelen látszik, hogy nem mai darab!

this is a pretty quick, extremely tight bidding game for adults, with a little bit of luck thrown in.  to me one of the better bidding games out there.

I am really unsure about this one.  One game it's great, the next it sucks.  There is a runaway leader problem if a player is able to get out in front after two rounds.  I haven't tried playing with the funding variant where everyone gets the same amount of cash after each round though.   Fun game with great artwork and better bits.  Interesting tie breaker technique on auctions that keeps everyone in the game.  Fun and fast.

Played half a game with my wife (just two players) and found a runaway leader problem if one player makes bids too large early.  We quit halfway through as neither of us thought it was worth it to finish.  I had heard good things, but based on my limited experience it just doesn't look or feel like a fun game unless you have a small group of gamers who want to play a tight bidding, light zoo game... I practically never have that.

Pieces are beautiful, game is easy to learn and blind bidding is no problem for me. However there is constant spatial reasoning required which makes this a brain burner for me and therefore painful for my opponents and for me.

Adquirido a el_mago8 el 26/11/2010 por 6€.
Es un juego de mayorías muy sencillo. Consiste en construir un zoo y conseguir atraer a mayor número de visitantes. El juego se divide en cinco años. Cada año se subastan cinco losetas, que hay que ir conectando a modo de dominó en el zoo. Cada vez que se coloca una loseta, se evalúa quién tiene la mayoría de visitantes de cada tipo de animal. Además, si se evalúa también la mayoría de setos y la creación de caminos cerrados. Los ultimos turnos son más importantes. En el primer turno se puntúa 1 punto por cada visitante, arbol o banco. En el turno X se puntúa X puntos por cada uno.  Sencillito. Contiene subastas y mayorías. Dos mecánicas que me gustan. Reglas muy sencillas.

Una lástima, porque no iba a ver mesa muy a menudo. Al final, se lo cambié a bicho por un Indus, el 1/04/2011

Volví a adquirirlo en las CLBSK2012 a chesirecat a cambio de un Alexandros. El Alexandros no veía mucha mesa, y este juego le gustaba bastante a mi madre, así que me pareció bien el cambio.

An interesting and solid game design.  The visual graphics of enclosures and paths may take a little to get used to, but behind all of this is quite a good game.  The theme is fun and the game doesn't ask too much from players, it also moves along at a nice clip, which is excellent in a game of this style and weight.

Altogether I think this is quite a good game, due to the theme, the length of time it takes to play and the solid game-play this is one my wife and I will enjoy.

(O Zoo Le Mio version)  Beautiful, outstanding game.  The theme is enjoyable and supports the mechanics well.  There are so many little touches to the game are very well done: the flagpole for resolving auction ties, the fact that newer exhibits win ties with existing exhibits, etc.  The closed auction system is quick yet requires careful thought as you try to evaluate what each tile is worth to your opponents in order to not overbid, and more importantly, to make sure your opponents do not underpay!  Overall, I am very impressed with how well the game is put together and how well it plays.

This one is IMHO significantly the best of Cwali's games. It's a great, simple, easily-explained system that plays quickly yet still has tough decisions and a variety of interesting strategic options.

Provides a nice challenge if you're in the mood.  If you're not, don't sweat it.  You can probably be effective without burning your brain.  I'm wondering about replayability - seems it lacks the ingredients to stay fresh over many plays, but as one we only play sporadically it is great.

Your zoo looks very nice at the end, and probably the best blind bidding game I've experienced in that the information is out there to help you determine what others will bid.

However, the person with the most tiles is often the winner, and loops and trees are more important than animals, which seems wrong in a game about building zoos (not that I care about that, my problem is actually that it makes the game a little predictable).

It is a light game, but offers enough to keep gamers coming back to it.  People like to fling crap at me for liking Carcassonne and disliking Alhambra.  I think I can deal with the randomness of these games if I feel I can still win based on my gameplay, and not the random factor.  I still don't feel that Alhambra manages this, but Carc and Zoo do.  I can plan and create and outwit, and that is why I really like this one.  Good game to get the girl into gaming.

This was a fun little thrift store find.  Blind auction system and tile-laying with a unique scoring system.  Seems best with 2, but is still fun with more - though with more than 2, it seems like it might have a bit of a runaway leader problem.  Still, I enjoy playing it, especially with the wife, and I suspect when my kids are a little older, they'll like it too.

Blind-bidding zoo-building game. The coloured meeples, trees and park benches in this version make updating the scoring much easier than the uniform black meeples in Zoo Sim. Fun game with lots of considerations that will influence your bidding and building decisions. It has a small footprint so I managed to play this on a long train journey with four players. Lots of baffled looks from other passengers and even an enquiry as to where it could be bought.

Recommended variants: 
1. Fixed income = 3 per year, 
2. Tiles only revealed one at a time (keeps analysis to a minimum), 
3. Year ends after third tile with trees is auctioned. Fifth year lasts until all tiles have been auctioned.

We like the way the multiple ways to score, which greatly influence how valuable each tile is.  You can score points for having the majority in each color (animal type).  In fact, if you tie the existing leader, then you take over the points.  These points are awarded after each round and can shift from person to person.  You also earn points for laying tiles so that a road loops.  You will score for these every round after earning them.  In each successive round of the game, you are awarded more and more points for what you've done.  There is also a clever system for breaking ties during bidding.  Money is very tight, but you have to spend it, or you won't get much money for the next round.

Almost inescapable runaway leader problems, with the initial leader dictated more by luck than anything else, combined and exacerbated by blind bidding.

the vision of the game is not obviously. ( "Oh sorry, I have not seen that the white counter is not yellow, oh one of yous sleepy customer hidden your trees" )
 Since you have reached a 5 counter in one color, you are saved.
At no moment I seem to have a nice place to play and have secure place for animals and customers even if I win !

Pleasant, colorful, cheerful, quick, quiet game with blind bidding. Since so many games have bidding, blind or sightly, I've developed an an attitude problem. I'm more inclined to look for games with other mechanics, but I'm trying not to be too rigid about that, just a little bit rigid.

The game is fair and balanced.  The packaging is stupid though.  I couldn't fit the entrances back in once I put them together, so I threw the cardboard insert out.  

We look forward to being able to introduce this to our children.  We think that is where this game will shine.  It's a bit simplistic for us as we have grown in the hobby, but is a solid blind bidding game none-the-less.

A fantastic family game - simple rules, colorful theme, nice bits, and best of all there is a decent amount of strategy/tactics involved.

I don't see a rich-get-richer problem: although you gain coins by having tiles - its usually less than what you've spent, so the leader can't win all the good tiles.

RATING: 6
I would probably rate this game higher if I didn't have the bitter taste of getting clobbered.  Its like a colorful thematic game of dominoes with a few whistles and bells thrown in...and married to a blind bidding mechanic.  The thing that irks me a little is that winning auctions gives you tiles...which gives you more income.  So, its possible to keep losing out on auctions and not being able to get your income going as well. Perhaps I'll feel that's insignificant with more playings...but at this point that seems like an annoying feature.

On the other hand, the rules are very intuitive and the theme and length of the game will appeal nicely to a lighter crowd.  I'd much rather play this than Carcassone, for what that's worth.

This seems like a excellent game of middle to light weight strategy. You have to bid on which attractions you will add to your Zoo. Each attraction has two kinds of animal exibits and from 0-4 trees. Points are awarded in 5 rounds for the best and second best displays of each animal exhibit, most trees and also visitors are awarded for having paths that loop. Which is a key consideration in deciding how well a tile will fit into your zoo. Any time you add bidding into a game it makes it keenly competitive in my opinion. Arranging the Zoo is very enjoyable and interesting as well.

This is a neat little zoo game that reminded me of Zooloretto, but with preprinted animals on the tiles.  I also like that the tiles are essentially dominoes.  I also like that you need to connect the paths optimally to fit new tiles AND complete pathway loops.  I love the giant crocodile and gila monster.  Fun.  The listed variants also add to the replayability and scale the difficulty quite well.  The tube package is okay.  Gonna fill the empty space w/ plastic animals for extra theme. Edit: I did.  It's awesome!

I have now played a 3 player game and about five 2 player games. I still give the game a 9. I like it better with 2 players.And I think it should be classified as a bidding game not a tile laying, because if you don't win the bid then you have no tile to lay.BTW the bids are blind.And I know some claim it's a rich get richer game. I don't see that. Have now played about 8 times and it still is a 9.

Great light Euro game.  Has all the elements: Tile laying, blind bidding auctions, money vs. victory point decisions.  Theme is great for families and lighter game players.

Lets me play an auction game with others.

Update in 2017:  This game has a run away leader problem.  If someone has an money advantage after round 1, it is really hard to catch up.  Game is still fun, but frustrating for some of our players now. Rating 7.75->7

I quite enjoy the arranging-stuff-well challenge of zoo construction. The blind-bidding serves that end nicely, though it's not what I play for.

As in any auction game, beginning players won't tend to have a good grasp of how much things are worth - and in this game, that can easily lead to a "rich get richer" effect if one player gets several tiles on the cheap that actually work pretty well together. This seems more likely to happen with the advanced variant; I'd recommend learning/teaching with the normal rules.

RATING: 7
Sort of a combo of Dominoes and Carcassone with blind bidding mixed in. Its a good game with a fair amount of strategy, although at first glance it might not appear that way. The lighter theme also tends to make it attractive to non-gaming types.

Components: Quality components, with fun artwork that forms an attractive labyrinth of animal exhibits. The wooden visitors, trees, and benches in this O Zoo Le Mio edition are a huge improvement over the generic pawns in the ZooSim edition. Unfortunately, the exhibit symbols (all stars) and colors are not color-blind friendly.

Experience: Cash is very tight. The bidding is fun, as is piecing together my tiles, and wrestling for control of types of exhibits. It's interesting how at first, only the stars on the animals matter. But soon, the path configuration becomes hugely important, as do the orientation of animals on the tile, and the number of bushes.

I recently played this and was reminded that it is very good game with one fatal flaw for me: you have to really keep very close track of the other player's boards. I guess for some people this is not much different than keeping track of other player's progress and positions on a central board (with which I have no problem)... but somehow for me, when that tracking is extended out to other people's separate boards, the fun just plummets for me.

An underrated gem, which really deserves more attention, this high quality Zoch/Rio Grande production combines tile laying and area/majority influence with a money-tight blind bid auction to create an aggressive little wolf in zoo-keeper's clothing.  This game rewards the skillful bidder and punishes the unwary.  May be slightly too difficult to take down an early leader.

According to those on the 'Geek, a better Zoo game than Zooloretto. I agree completely. To me, it seems very reminiscent of Carcassonne, with a little bit of Dominos thrown in for good measure.  I like this game.  An extra bonus - it doesn't have a Panda on the box!

This has become the first game I own that I have actually customized, or "pimped".  The little cardboard "zoo entrances" that you are supposed to use to conceal how much money you have are just too small, and keep getting knocked over, so I took 4 Altoids tins, cut up the entrance pieces to fit and glued them on the top, then primed, painted, and sealed them.  Also, because I accidentally lost one of the flag pieces, I now use color-matched 4-sided dice for the tie-breaker order.

Played with a "non-profit" variant, this becomes an excellent tile placing auction game.  Some compare it with Carcassonne, but O Zoo le Mio is more thematic, more fun and less luck ridden, in short about a 100 times better. It is short and meaty and to top it off, also very accessible to new gamers.  The new edition also looks great, if you can live with the silly game name, that is.

Don't buy this for the zoo theme...it's pretty thin.  Also, don't buy it because you think it'll be light.  It isn't.  However, I like this game more every time I play.  It's a great, great strategy game buried in a light sounding theme.

Pleasant "in the fist" auction game where players bid on tiles to construct their Zoos.  Tiles feature two of five kinds of animal exhibits.  If exhibits are placed adjacent to each other they combine their worth and the largest will attract visitors.  Visitors equals points.  After five rounds, total up for a winner.  Lovely looking game.  Raid another game and get some coloured cubes for the visitors - makes it much easier to track the constantly changing majorities.  Plays fast and well, even if there is a hint of "rich get richer" about it.  Worth a look.

Frankly, it feels broken. I like the bits, the theme, etc. but the income mechanic doesn't work and upsets the dynamic of the auction mechanic. The tile placement for color majority is counter-intuitive at first as well and takes a little extra care during rules explanation. With a little work, this could be much better.

I prefer this to the Carc games, to which it bears a superficial resemblance. There are 4 nifty mechanics that do away with the runaway leader problem: the auctioning of tiles, the income mechanic (you get as many coins as you have tiles in your zoo, which encourages you to bid on tiles), the visitors mechanic (in the event of a tie, visitors will go to the newest exhibit), and most importantly the scoring itself (multiply the points you earn that year by the year number, so that everything is worth more and more as the game progresses).  All these things combine to make an enjoyable game with many considerations, with less luck overall and far less of a runaway leader problem compared to the Carc game. And the wooden components are very nice as well: green tree meeple, black bench meeples, raibow assorted people meeples, and little white drug meeples (they look like pills to me).

Got in a game trade. Can't wait to try it out.

Update: Played half a game, 2 player. It was quite interesting. We both never played before and tried to understand how it worked. We had a good idea on how it worked in the end, but we had questions about who gets visitors in certain situations, so we stopped playing.

Looking forward to a full game with someone who knows the rules. Happy about the trade. Game looks very promising.

Update 2: Played 2 games. Noticed that when someone has the lead in points, it's hard to catch up. Don't know if it's like that every game or not.

Blind bidding for the tiles. Replayability questionable. Similiar to Carcassonne for certain things.

Initially, I thought this was a fun bidding/majority control/dominoes/Carcassonne-like game.

However, it suffered from the "pretty much any mechanic in this game was done better in a different game" disease, so it became one of those games that I liked in theory but not in practice. It also has that problem with "the rich get richer" that really leaves a bad taste in my mouth.

Really enjoyed this game two players but I think it will really shine with more players as there will be more competition and more tactics in the blind bidding part of the game.

The blind bidding mechanic for the zoo tiles is fairly standard you have a certain amount of coins, you bid a certain amount in a closed hand, bids are shown and highest bidder wins. The flag mechanic whereby the winning bidder moves to the bottom of the flag pole is nice as it should stop a player from repeatedly winning bids due to tie breaks.

The tile placement aspect is really simple, tiles have two exhibit types on them and you want to place exhibit types next to each other, however this is made a lot more difficult and a lot more strategic by the pathways which sprawl over the tiles. Paths must line up and if you create a loop you add a bench which scores points.

This pathway configurations means that there is more to the bidding than just the exhibit types and thus you can never be sure you can bid low for that mammal exhibit because you are the only one in mammals, its pathways might look pretty good to an opponent.

It is a little fiddly moving the visitors around all the time and I think this fiddlyness will increase with more players however a quick check on exhibit types before actual scoring sorts this out (mostly).

On the downside the player screens are very small and so where you have quite a few coins they dont fit behind the screen.

Suffers a little from win more mechanic for allocating coins. Quick house rule of each player getting the same number of coins each round fixes this.

Sold in 2015.

An auction game with a very tight money supply. Slightly tricky keeping track of the changing people, but a clever, fun, challenging game. Definately worth buying. When will Corne win the SdJ?

***

Played again after a few years, marked down from 9 to 8. I lost badly after spending too much in round one. I missed out on two rounds, and didn't have the income or points to hold my lead. Getting loops and trapping customers early reaps big rewards as the game progresses. I mark it down, as it was impossible to peg back the leader. But I'd love to play this again.

* Played 10+ times. Interesting little game. Easy to learn and teach, fairly easy to play, but with quite a bit of strategy involved, if you choose to play it that way. A bit more strategic than the average non-gamer game, but very accesible because of the theme. The meeples should have been colored (fixed with Rio Grande/Zoch ed.) and I think scoring might need to be tweaked slightly to make it a bit more non-gamer friendly. Every playing feels a bit the same, definitely not highly replayable, but still a neat game with a good theme. I like to call this game "Traumfabrik lite". [fs]

With a few notable exceptions, blind bidding is a turn-off for me. In O Zoo le Mio, however, it works fairly well, possibly because the bidding increments are very coarse-grained. Perhaps even too coarse since the tie-breaker is called on very frequently.

Players bid for extensions for their zoos, hoping to build the most attractive enclosures to score points. Auctions, tile-laying, and area majorities in one small package.

Great blend of auction and tile-laying in an attractive theme.  It's important to pay attention to the tile distribution as much as the point distribution.  If one player gets too many tiles, there could be a runaway leader.  That would only be an issue if other players aren't aware of what could happen.  At the end of any year, no player should ever have more than a one tile lead over the other players.

A light tile placement game in which players are attempting to attract customers to their ever growing zoological parks.  Fun, quick and scales well.  Nothing spectacular here, just a solid little game. Doesn't scale well with two, due to the blind bidding.

A fun zoo game that plays very similar to carcassonne but the pieces are rectangular not square and instead of getting points for tiles you get points for visitors which only come if you have the best (or second best) type of show in your zoo.

The only downside is the scoring, each round things go up in value, each piece scores 1 point in the first round and eventually 5 points in the last round which means that the winner is really who scores the most in the last two rounds since those scores easily outstrip any scores people got in the first three.

An old Rio Grande tile laying game and bidding game that is one of my perennial favorites. Everybody loved it, the building, the cutthroat bidding really ramps up the tension. Our normally no AP-prone, super fast group, were all rather playing slow and careful. That gives you an idea how intense this little game is! The components are absolutely beautiful, they don't make games like this any more.

I like O Zoo Le Mio. It is a realy attractive game and players enjoy constructing their zoos, building benches and attracting visitors. Most players have needed some prompting to play strategically...folks can tend to go on building bigger and bigger enclosures to be 'The Reptile King' or whatever when points actuall lie in breaking into a new species. Great value little game - recommended.

RATING: 8
A quick, beautiful, and tense blind bidding game.  Different tiles are worth more to different people, so you need to decide whether to bid high to make sure you get what you want, or hold back with the expectation that you can get what you want cheaper.  I love the low granularity of the bids and the clever "flagpole" tie-breaker.

The zoo entrances are not at all helpful for stashing coins.  There is a "poor get poorer" syndrome, but experience will temper that.

I gave Mom my copy... and later bought myself another. =)

RATING: 7
A beautiful, surprisingly subtle game of prioritizing, outguessing, and spatial juggling.  O Zoo le Mio demonstrates the three chief virtues I look for in an auction game: difficult-to-value lots, different values to different players, and grainy bidding.  The tie-breaking flagpole works perfectly for the game, which will see frequent ties due to the scarcity of coins.  To show you how much difference good graphic design can make, my comments for the original Cwali edition ZooSim were: "Too much squinting and counting and recounting and asking "how many elephants do you have over there?" with too little payoff."  My rating for that edition was 5.  The colored meeples makes a huge difference, allowing for easier scanning of the playing area.

I enjoy this game, but that's not to say it doesn't have it's problems.  The late auctions in the final season are sometimes useless as there is no benefit to saving money.  Would be interesting to try it with open bidding, but then what do you do about the tie-breaker?  Overall it's a lot of fun and winning the right piece to build up your zoo is extremely satisfying.  Additionally, the sheepish look on someone's face (mine included) when they just overpaid by 3 for a tile is priceless.

One of the games I purchased to get my girlfriend into gaming. The zoo theme held some hope, however its simply a Carcassonne variant with a zoo theme pasted on. It didn't really offer much beyond an awkward auction mechanic and Carcassonne is still much preferred over this game. Its hard when there's very similar game experiences between games. It's not like we play one game so much that we wish there was another similar game but just different enough. Some people may look for that be we don't, so its gone.

This is a simple game to learn and play.  However to win, you have to be good a bidding and be lucky enough to guess right about other bidders by not over paying and paying enough to get it at the same time.  It does seem like once you are behind, you will stay behind however.  I didn't like this the first time I played it and the second time didn't change my mind much either.  I'll probably play it again, however it's not my favorite.  Maybe next year? >8^)

I have two huge caveats for this otherwise unprecedented and counter-intuitive bloated rating. First off, it's the perfect couple's game for my girlfriend and I. Second, we both share a strong love of animals (she's an undergrad aiming for vet school and I'm a Zoo Tycoon addict). 

Still, I believe this game is massively underrated. I usually hate blind bidding auctions, but the mechanics for ties and instantly recognizable score shifts make it an indispensable mechanic. The bits are stellar and the tile placement is reminiscent of the finer parts of Carcassonne and Dominoes. The level of complexity hits me as just right and there's plenty of room for strategy AND tactics. 

A lot of people hold a gripe for the supposed "rich get richer" problem, but I think this is only possible with a lackadaisical group who isn't bidding aggressively enough. Tiles are worth income, present blocking opportunities, and allow looping for benches even if they pose no significant bonus to your exhibits directly. All of my games have been close with this understanding in mind. Basically I believe it to be a problem with the users and not a fault of the system.

Update:  Ok ok, so there might be a slight rich gets richer problem.  I still love the game and will work to correct its now somewhat apparent inadequacies.

With its simple rules, moderate playing time and attractive theme, O Zoo Le Mio is a great game to bring out if there are non-gamers or casual gamers among the players. O Zoo Le Mio also serves well as lighter fare for serious gamers. The blind bidding works very well given the restricted amount of game currency, tie-resolving mechanism and the fact that each tile will have a different worth for each player depending on how they have built their zoo. Works well with 2, 3 or 4 players.

Games where both the cash mechanic and the VP mechanic rely on the same snowball system are usually broken.

This one is no exception.  If you can get a snowball going versus the other players in turn one, you have won before the scoring is done for turn 1.  The runaway leader issue is so bad here, I'm going to proclaim it is the worst runaway leader game I've ever seen...and I can think of a couple others in the running for that

Probably an OK game with kids as its pretty easy, but with adults, its just bad.

This game is much improved by the following variant: All players receive the same quantity of "money" before the second, third, fourth, and fifth rounds.  For 2 or 3 players, 3 per round.  For 4 players, 4 per round.  Everyone still starts the game with 8.  Playing without this variant usually results in a runaway leader.

Auctions, tile-laying, and set-collection. The early round auctions are the type I dislike, where the items up have roughly equal value to everyone. But they're blind bids, so at least they're fast. As the game progresses, the items  become differently valued. And they're still blind bids, so they're still fast! You'll probably screw up at least once and buy something you can't fit into your zoo where you want it.

RATING: 6
initial rating for 2 player game...

A nice light fast playing game with a decent theme. You are blind bidding (which I enjoy and have no problem with at all) for tiles to help build your zoo. You are trying to connect paths on your tiles and form "loops" for points, win majorities in colors by careful placment, and also have the most combined trees. 

The game works fine for 2 and I loved the game during the first 2 years out of 5 and thought it was sooo much better than standard Carc or the like with silent auctions and multiple ways to score *BUT* then the rich get richer problem pretty much put me out of the game (by then my opponent had double my money so I had no way to compete to make more money). Granted it was my first game and I didn't realize how important it would be to stay "tile to tile" with my experienced opponent but the problem is there and I see a few people recommending every player should get paid the same at the end of a year. That may or may not be a good variant and I want to try it but playing with 3 people versus 2 will also lessen the effect as well I believe. I don't think 4 would be a great number for this but I could be wrong.

I will try this again with 3 people to see if it is any better...

One downpoint; ain't no way it's all fitting back in the box once you've made the zoo entrances - they don't look too likely to withstand repeated assembly/dissasembly, but there's nowhere to fit them unless you take out the white cardboard divider in the box and fling it away. Which, obviously, goes against all my principles as a game collector!

I enjoyed this deceptively light auction-and-tile placement game, but agree with the "rich get richer" comments.

I'm having a hard time with this one. I enjoyed the auctions and building my zoo but at the same time I didn't feel I could do enough each round, and not in that nail biting good way of other games. 

It seems that it could be hard to catch the leader unless the other players team up on him which seems strange in an auction game.

Feels like it should be a family game, but the closed economy and zero-sum nature of some of the interactions feels very limiting. Tie break order shift automatically with an auction winner moving to the bottom, which gives clear advantages and disadvantages that are tied more to turn order and timing than to bidding decisions. There are some interesting things here, but the experience is ultimately unsatisfying both as a family game and a gamer's game.

An auction and set collection game disguised as a tile laying game.  The essence of the game is to bid on items with the purpose of having majorities in different colors of colored stars.  The tile laying element is just that placement creates certain restrictions which might prevent you from adding some values together, and which also create some opportunities for additional scoring.

Nothing earth shatteringly fresh, but enough to have some original flavor.

Visually appealing. ZooCoins are very tight, so a bad auction could really hurt. A little bit too much going on for a casual gamer. You really have to pay attention and anticipate to play competitively. But again, great bits, great theme.

Update: I've downgraded to a 6 because of a lack of catch-up opportunities once a player falls behind. But need to try again with the fixed income variant.

RATING: 6
So far only played with two players, but I was surprisingly satisfied playing that way.  While reading the rules I thought that money would be really tight (which kind of bothers me in auctions, when everyone bids one or two, like in Industria), but there is some nice tension in the game.  It is a little challenging to quickly assess the value of a tile, especially since the paths on the tiles can make it hard to place.  One concern is with a potential runaway leader problem.  Since each successive year is worth more points, it seems like jumping out to an early lead can be especially lucrative, though not necessarily unbeatable.

A surprisingly deep game hidden under a disarming theme. The money tokens are pretty annoying but aside from that the game pieces are beautiful and practical. The artwork isn't high quality but certainly does not detract from the game. The game lacks an effective catchup mechanic given the appeal of the game to younger players. That said there is a subtle balancing mechanic and I imagine between experienced players this would become important.
For some reason I can't see this being picked up by many gamers out there but I believe it is a good crossover.

It wins my vote just by having an animal theme, zoos - great! But it's actually a good game, looks good as well with all the meeple 'treeples' and 'chairples' (so my husband tells me they are called, personally I think he is pulling my leg).

It's clearly influenced by Carcassonne, but it is a nice adaptation with its own thing going on. Clearest differing thing from Carc is the auctioning of the tiles which I quite like. Major con might be that it seems to be easy to build a fortified position on one color which reduces the competition on those.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I keep reading that this is a light game and I don't see it. If you think your way through an optimal strategy its very deep. And there's nothing wrong with that. The score does reflect my general dismay of blind bidding.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Plenty of factors to try optimizing.  Excellent!  

Also, accessible to the young, and since the puzzle of building your own zoo is lots of the fun for old and young, it is not a problem if you're "better" because you're older; regardless of their score, the inexperienced player is pleased with their own zoo that they built.

Beware: A new player who unwisely overbids a few times early in the game can be left permanently in the dust, because your income each year is equal to the number of tiles you have gotten, so there is some positive feedback that helps the player with more tiles get even more tiles next year.  If this starts to happen, help the new player with some free money or a few chances to keep his overbid amount, because if they run short of money and stay short of money, the game will not be fun any more toward the end.

We found the rules (enclosures, esp) awkwardly written. Seems to work well for 2, 3 or 4 players. The 1st 3 player game was very close (119-118-118); there are some runaway leader concerns, but perhaps more experience will help solve that problem. Who doesn't want to build their own zoo? Make sure you get at least 2 tiles every round.

Some people on BGG complain about the "rich getting richer" syndrome with this game. I've never seen it myself, but enough people complain about it that there must be some truth to it.  Maybe the game group determines how OZLM plays out. (Kind of like how in my experience Bang! has been slow for me, but others say they've never had the problem.) 

Or maybe I've always just been one of the rich ones??

This is a great game with the family.  It is closed bidding, which some people may not like. There is a tendency for a runaway leader problem.

Although I'm not good in this kind of games, this is a great one. it's the finest time tile-laying and set collection meets.

But the runaway leader problem is really strong here, unless you play using the "equal amount of coins gained" rule variant.

This is a good auction game.   It works well with two players.  The pieces are cute,not as cute as Aquaretto, but cute in their own way.  The game is mostly an auction for the zoo tiles, and a little bit of tile placement when you win them.  Pretty quick, fun game, with pretty pictures.  Just the kind I like.

More meeples!  What's not to love about that?  Similar in some ways to Carcassonne but with a bidding element for the right to purchase and place a tile in your own personal zoo.  Must match roads and seek to enclose areas, match similar types of animals to be adjacent to each other, get the most trees, etc...Scoring is based on the number of meeples you have in your zoo and in which round you are - one multiplies the number of meeples in one's zoo by the round number.

This seems to be less like Zooloreto (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/295664) and more like Carcassonne (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/291832) with an auction component.

It shares the theme with Zooloreto, but looking at a game in play, it looks awfully similar to Carcassonne.

It does seem, however, that OZLM stands on its own merits as a good game.

I have the "O Zoo le Mio" version, with the zoo patrons in different colors, which I understand is a huge improvement over the original.

The game is a nice blend of several game elements, including blind bidding/bluffing, tile placement, and area influence/majority scoring.

A lot of game in a little box.  The bidding, placement, scoring and income systems mesh very well together, and the theme is superbly integrated.  A nice find.

My kids love it, and played competitively for a while with my houserule that all children start with 1 extra $ and collect 1 extra $ at each income phase, which we played with until they outgrew their chronic overbidding.  As they've gotten more savvy about the bidding, they no longer need this advantage.  They're competitive under the normal rules, and defeat me consistently if we play with the houserule.  

We've had a lot of fun with this one.

Not only does this game have a wonderful theme, it's beautiful to look at too.  Meeples and Treeples!  I thought this was going to be a fairly simple minded tile-placement game but the auction mechanism combined with the scoring system and the fairly small amount of zoo coins you're given to bid with provide a ton of tough decisions.  At the same time, I think a 10 year old would probably pick this one up quite quickly.

Subsequent plays make the game more interesting.  The theme, at first seemingly cliched, instead becomes cute and clever.  With different zoo pieces coming up, positions can change within the rounds.  Unfortunatly, however, a poor showing in the first few rounds seems to drag a player down in the later few.  The game makes up for this by being a fast, light filler with good replayability.

RATING: 6
After forcing myself to play this ten times for 2016's 10x10 Challenge, I have to admit this is a pretty solid game. Yes, the graphic design is [i]terrible[/i], a real hindrance to my enjoyment, but I nonetheless find myself oddly satisfied after each session. There's a nice strategic arc to the game, and you're always thinking about something, whether its how much to bid, how to place your tile, how much your opponent has left to spend, etc. I still never seem to [i]want[/i] to play it, but the same can be said of a lot of my other 6s that are both unalluring yet somehow satisfying once played (Ubongo, Pandemic).

For those considering acquiring O Zoo le Mio, do note that this game is not the cutesy game it might seem at first. If you play it casually, you'll probably be left wondering why you didn't just play Carcassonne instead. The auctions make this into a light gamer's game; as long as you're ready to take those on and turn a blind eye to the horrific graphics, you'll find a lot to like here, especially since it's so quick.

RATING: 7
A light tile-placement game with various scoring rules based on having a majority of certain animals within your zoo and certain features (benches for patrons to sit on, trees for shade and the like). 

It isn't a bad design at all but just not that memorable or fulfilling.

a clever bidding game, usually with small bids and a simple but necessary tie-breaking system. you bid for tiles to put together your own zoo. The tiles are placed carcassonne style, and majorities of depicted elements (animals, trees, benches) are scored.

RATING: 7
I'm a fan of Corné van Moorsel, and he put together a clever one in ZooSim that really clicks. Fun bidding mechanism as players scramble to build leads in different types of animals. The trees and looping paths can really make a difference as well. There's a bit of a Carcassonne-type feel when placing together your tiles for the best effect. Escalating point totals for each visitor throughout the five rounds.

RATING: 8
Fun theme and good blind bidding / area majority game. There are only 5 tiles auctioned between scorings and after 5 scorings it's over. All 5 tiles are shown at the start of the round so you can plan ahead that much. Pretty short game but packed with action. Works well with 3 and 4 players. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
A very clever blind bidding game, and the wonderful theme works very well. The mechanism for breaking ties is absolutely brilliant. The game seems somewhat prone to a runaway leader problem, so don't let the other players get too many tiles ahead.

RATING: 6
An auction game with a fun tile-laying twist, O Zoo is frustrating and rewarding by turns, because your tile valuation needs to be absolutely spot-on to play well. There probably is something of a runaway leader problem, but with 2 players, the 'advanced' rules and fixed-level cash earning, you hit the optimum spot where this is minimised. Nice chunky components and cheerful art help you to take it lightly.

Simultaneous blind bidding for tiles that fit together to make zoo attractions. 5 rounds, escalating scoring after each round, points going to first and second place in each of several animal categories.
Nothing really special - a nice theme and quick gameplay, offset by a runaway leader score system. Based on gameplay, this should be a 5/10.

OWN Jun/06.  Unplayed, but sounds simple enough & fun from the rules.

Try Jun/06.  Income seems unbalancing.  Players with more tiles probably already have more points, and then are favoured even more with more coins too?!?  I suppose it encourages larger bids...  but we'll be trying the level-income variants too.  Yes, this works nicely with level-income -- my daughter made a nice comeback to win.

Quick and basic auction game that interacts pretty well with the geometrical theme of the coloured cards. Tried with 2, 3 and 4 players, in all conditions it works very well, altough obviously the cost of the cards changes consequently and with 4 players the game becomes really challenging.
One note about the graphics: the animals are drawn in pretty serious way, I'd have preferred something more funny, and the colours are not very clear, expecially when you have to explain when they are connected and when not to a non-gamer. Maybe a line to separate the two squares of one single tile would have been enough.
I don't agree with the "rich get richer" thesys. Absolutely, the scoring permits everyone to win until the very last turn.
I also don't agree with who says that the score is difficult: it's very easy to "count the objects you have", warning that "this is the third turn, so everyone counts 3". Very very easy.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Simple and fun game, that I enjoy very much. 

In each turn, 5 tiles are auctioned off using closed fist bidding. These tiles are then added to the auction winner's zoo, expanding the size and interest of its attractions. Visitors will tend go to the most interesting zoos and in the end of each turn the number of visitors is scored. Players will also receive more money for each tile in their zoos. Repeat for 5 rounds, add up the scores and find out who's the winner.

The game seems very simple, but it's actually very interesting. The components are very good and it plays very well with 2, 3 or 4 players. A really good game!

Very few components included. The zoo needs some planning to be even a bit good.

I really like the idea that all the five auction pieces are visible at the same time. It reduces luck element lets you plan ahead.

Of course, the game is mean. You always try to exceed the others since the scoring objects are limited. Luckily, I didn't choose the pieces too badly in my first game.

Cute game but after just one play I'm not sure how replayable it is.  I wish the animal illustrations were easier to identify.  Instead, I group like animals into enclosures by the colored stars next to them rather than by the animals themselves (fish, birds, jungle animals, etc.), because I have a hard time recognizing the animals.  So it becomes more of an abstract game grouping colors than a zoo game grouping animals.  But I plan to try it some more.

Update: there is a lot I like about the design but ultimately a couple of things has forced me to downgrade the need to play again. 
I like 'in the fist' auctions as they are simultaneous and also a source of humour be it bluffing sitcom or coincidental bids. 
I like how majorities are indicated immediately and visually with little cross-referencing as well as adding to the theme of attracting visitors (overall the game is still abstract and so rules difficult to hang onto, flag mechanic for example). However I think Rheinlander helps this cognitive process with a single figure centred on the board.
And there aren't many games with a zoo setting :-). 
But what was the killer for enthusiasm for the game is the tiles and the mechanic: both aspects alienates some players, mainly the tile detail and distribution favours those familiar with it (and it is has no real value in life) so makes strategic evaluation at auction difficult for the uninformed. 
Then there is the spatial orientation of the placement which can be a source of downtime (but should have been assessed at time of auction) but this is a tile expansion game so options increase and game rhythm is slowing as a consequence. 
Looks like Brand Zooloretto may be the best place to visit (but alas no, seems Cheeky Monkey is the best 'zoo').


I've played many games using Aquire's majority scoring, but here it is employed and monitored so cleanly and simply that is so refreshing and charming to experience. Game play is simultaneous and socially involving, with dramatic and fun "in the fist" auctions, spatial assessment and placement that I like. I can see why players are concerned with rich gets richer, but I feel that for the leader to be pulled back, the stragglers shouldn't interefere with each other's 2nd place holdings. The simple gameplay leaves me with more desire to explore when to best go for park benches vs visitors. Initially, I was lukewarm but with new colourcoded "meeples", benches and trees in the compact O Zoo edition I'm under it's spell; it also satifies my Carcassonne and Princes of Florence needs.

A nice blend of Carcassonne and Zooloretto. Scoring is a little cumbersome, but the theme is good, the components are of very high quality (I get the Pig Shack!), and the game itself is simple to learn.  There is a bit of a "run away" factor, if you aren't aggressive early, but that really only hurts the first play through.  Get out there and buy some land!!!  Good times.

Quite a nice auction/set-collection game, which reminds me of Fzzzt. However, the fact that tiles give you both points and income (unlike Fzzzt, in which you have to balance the two) does give it a bit of a rich-get-richer problem.

I do think the even equal money after each round variant is the only way to go with this game though.

RATING: 7
One two-player game (O Zoo le Mio). With only two players there is a strong rich-get-richer aspect. This might not be too much of an issue with experienced auction game players but a lesser experienced player will see doom written on the wall after the second scoring year. The bits are very nice and the game flows smoothly. The relative small number of tiles (25) will make semi-memorization fairly easy after a few plays. Selection of 25 from a lager pool would add to replay value. I expect the game will be uprated to an 8 with the 3rd and 4th players. Money will be tighter, scoring lower (fewer tiles each), and the leader will have two or three opponents gunning for the most useful (to the leader) tiles. Worth playing again. (Suggested fixed income of 7-#of players sounds good to me.)

Something about the creepy looking monkey face on the cover made me think O Zoo le Mio was going to be really light. It's not light at all. It's the most brain burning game I've played in quite some time. I can't believe that there are pictures of kids playing it in the game gallery because it was definitely a brain burner. Each player is building a little zoo. The goal is to build the biggest enclosures of each type (color) with these big tiles. Each tile has roads on it and two different colors of zoo enclosures.

You get tiles in five sections and blind bid for the first tile to go into one player's zoo. You keep bidding until the first lot of five are gone and then start on the next lot. There are five lots and the zoos score after each lot of five tiles. The person who has the most stars of a certain color gets two people in his/her zoo, while second place gets one person in his/her zoo. As each person builds a better zoo of each type the three spectators move between the zoos in a kind of tug of war. Additionally, if you get a section completely closed in with roads, you get a park bench, and the most trees and second most trees will determine the tree pieces. The pieces of wood in your zoo will score points every round and more point values increase every round.

Money is very tight and it makes the decisions painful.

My initial rating was a seven but since I had a dream about it the night after my only play, I upped my rating to 8.  Obviously, it made an impression on me. 

What I like:
:star: The pieces are gorgeous!
:star: Decision making is painful.
:star: It's complexity made simple.

What I don't like:
:star: I suck. :(
:star: Decisions can induce some AP.
:star: I have a difficult time envisioning where the pieces should go in my zoo without holding them up to my zoo, which obviously I can't do because it would show everyone my plans.

Take a hint of dominoes, with a spoonful of auction, a few drops of 'majority-control', and sprinkle with bright artwork & little wooden pieces (meeples, treeples, & ... um ... park-bench'eeples), & voila!

I think the fixed income variant recommended by the designer probably helps to fix the slight 'rich-get-richer' problem that can occur in this game.

Variant: Instead of the 1 coin per tile payout eac player gets:
End of turn 1: 1 coin
End of turn 2: 2 coins
End of turn 3: 3 coins
End of turn 4: 4 coins

Foi uma das maiores surpresas que obtive até hoje ao experimentar um jogo pela primeira vez, isto porque as expectativas eram muito baixas! Gosto muito de Zooloretto, mas este Zoo le Mio não se fica nada atrás e ganha na rapidez com que se conclui um desafio. Apesar de estar referenciado como 2 a 4 jogadores, acredito que este seja um dos poucos casos em que o melhor seja jogá-lo a 3, pois a quatro precisaria de mais peças para serem colocadas a leilão e a 2 o que não for para um é para o outro e a pontuação fica bizarra.

--Sep2016-- Funny. I was sure I'd played it before.  (And possibly had - back before I logged my plays.)
I'm not a huge fan of blind bidding:  but this isn't a bad implementation of it.  There's a plausibly-sensible tiebreaker, and the losers don't pay their bids.  Still, it makes me appreciate [thing=355][/thing] more.
I do find myself wondering what the game looks like when all parties understand the relative value of each tile.  I'm pretty sure I didn't in this most recent play:  and that likely threw random advantage & disadvantage to the other players.  So it's possibly (quite a bit) better when the players are (all) competent.

RATING: 3
(O Zoo Le Mio) Annual income depending on the number of tiles in your zoo easily creates a heavy runaway problem. Haven't tried out the "non-profit" variant yet, so rating may go up.
Update: now we tried quite a number of variations. Some diminished the rich-gets-richer problem, some didn't. All in all, to me the design feels incomplete. Nice bits, great theme, but there are a lot of games with tiles which I'd prefer.

I feel with a couple of tweaks this game could be a really good one - if I could just get a few people willing to play it I could test some ideas out. If you're worried about the rich getting richer then give each player a fixed five token income each turn - this should give players who had a bad round early the chance to catch up. Nice and simple game played in under an hour and explained in less than five minutes. I would think this game would be popular with new or infrequent gamers - for the more experienced there's something in there for them too. It's like Dominos and Carcassonne rolled into a single game, with bidding as it's primary mechanism. Twenty five auctions in the one game does feel a little too much though. Just for fun.
Plays well with my five year old, but better with open round and round bidding to eliminate some of the luck - following bids can tie a previous one to knock players down the flag pole.

RATING: 5
Very analytical game in which you have to decide if you want to bid for a tile and, if you've been able to get it, to fit it maximizing your score and lowering down your rival's.  Not an every day's game, cause there is so much thinking involve, but sure a nice one.

I found this to be an interesting little combination of tile-laying and auction games.  Although I tend to dislike blind bidding in games, it kind of worked here, I'm guessing because of the general small amount of money involved most of the game.  I do like the excalation inherent to the game as well as the requirement for players to continue expansion of established areas and not just rest on their laurels.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Great components in a theme that undermines what is actually quite a tense game. It's dominoes bought via an auction mechanic with some Carcassonnish tile placement(that is more tricky than Carcassonne). It's all in the auction and with limited money you have to be very careful in what you pay. It is too tricky to play with kids though, as I find with all auction games. So the theme looks childish but this is a seriously good game for 2-4 adults.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.7
O Zoo le Mio -- Man, could I suck [i]more[/i] at this?  I love the tie-breaking flagpole mechanism.  (Higher on the flagpole wins you the tie, but then you drop to the bottom of the pole.)  Strategic bidding can allow you to take advantage of the pole when your flagpole position is high, while allowing other players' ties to move you up the pole.  Still, it seems inordinately difficult to surmount the monetary advantage a player gains from having more tiles (runaway leader).

One of the most aesthetically beautiful games I've ever played, with colored tourists, tree, park benches, and a variety of very authentic looking critters on the tiles (sez I at one point: "I think that's a ring-tailed lemur!"). Also, plays very well in both auction and tile-laying/puzzle aspects.

RATING: 7
Original Cwali Tin edition.

Great blind bidding auction game sees players as directors of a zoo. They then bid for tiles to attract visitors. 5 tiles are auctioned per season and scoring is done at the end of each season (a little fiddly).

Lots of tension and the start of each season is met with stony silence as players stare at the tiles for auction, making decisions on what to buy.

Do not overbid for tiles too early in the round as money can get tight, leading to other players getting tiles cheaply. Also, scoring in the 4th and 5th rounds are worth x4 and x5 respectively. These are rounds to attack and build on loops made earlier.

Use the equal wealth distribution variant when playing with inexperienced players.

Good fun. Plays fairly quick as well.

Make no mistake, O Zoo le Mio is a light game - but it manages to present some interesting choices to players. Each of the 2-4 players is a zoo director trying to build a zoo which attracts the most visitors, as well as erecting the most park benches and trees. The game is played over five years, during each of which sees the auctioning off (via blind bidding) of file zoo tiles. Once a tile is successfully won, the winner places it in his zoo so that the paths match up. If dominance is established in one of the exhibit types (reptiles, apes, etc.), then that zoo immediately attracts more visitors. Completing a path loop in your zoo earns you a park bench, and players with more shrubberies in their zoos get little trees. At the end of each year, your score is a multiplier of how many visitors/benches/trees are hanging out in your zoo. You recieve one coin for each *tile* in your zoo, at the end of every year.

So you're trying to do a number of things in O Zoo le Mio: get the most tiles, spend as little as possible for the tiles you do manage to win, attract as many visitors/benches/trees to your zoo as possible, and *block* your opponents from achieving these goals. That's a lot of action for a quick, lighter game like this! I really like how all these elements come together. The blind bidding adds an element of psychology, the tile laying adds an element of Carcassonne-like strategy, and the design of the game is simple enough to teach people to play in about two minutes.

Update: repeated plays have seen a drop in my estimation for this game. More and more, the game revolves around how well players bid in the blind bidding phases. If you are good at sensing what your opponents are going to do with respect to bidding, you will win with your savvy bets. There is little strategy, I think, in the actual tile placement, and only slightly more in tile choice.

I didn't think I would enjoy auction games much but I love this game - even though I'm not very good at it. It has an appealing theme which is easy to get people (particularly women) to play and it is easy to explain. There is also a lot of challenge in laying those tiles just right. The componants are a joy, especially for the relatively small price of the game.

This game was an immediate hit with the gaming group.  Without being too complicated, it keeps everyone engaged and thinking.

Great little gem of a game.  Gorgeous pieces and easy rules allows this for this to be a great intro game and a pleasure to look at.  Nice auction and tile placement with some great decisions.  I'm generally not a fan of blind bidding, but I think it works well in this game as there is such a short supply of money and the flagpole that determines the ties really help to valuate the bids.  While this game gives people their own area to build the mechanics are pure area control in concept.  As a fan of area control games, this really demonstrates the gaming mechanic in a simple pure form. I fail to see the runaway leader problem as each turn multiplies in points.  If you recognize who is in the lead, and you have been playing a strong game, it isn't that tough to usurp them mid to late game. Highly recommended.

My second auction game (after Raj) and I found it to be a good time; nice and light.

I like the tie-breaking mechanism, simple but makes a lot of sense.

O Zoo le Mio is an o.k, auction and tile laying game, though I always have the feeling that the rich get richer in this one.  What I do like about it is the tie-breaking system, where players get turns as the person who would win a tie.

The game is basically a blind bidding game, a mechanic of which I am not overly fond. Players bid for tiles and place them in their palazzo… er… zoo, to maximize victory points. It is like Princes of Florence with just the auction phase, only with blind bidding. This would not exactly be a high endorsement from me.

Yet, I like the aesthetics of the components and artwork of a zoo-sim type theme. I like to watch the parks grow as the game unfolds. This alone raises my rating a point.

It's a fun cross between Zooloretto and Carcassonne, and the components are really neat.  But something about the way the game goes, whether its the bidding or the art on the tiles, bothers me.  I'm happy I played it, though.  Oh, and for the record, this is one of the worst box covers in history.

RATING: 7
Features a LOT of blind bidding, which I don't normally like. But it is mitigated by a pretty clever tie-breaking mechanism: whichever player's flag is higher on the pole wins ties (and their flag is moved to the bottom). In addition, the tile-laying and set-collection mechanisms add a good bit to the game. You have to be able to manipulate tiles in your head and figure out where (and if) they fit into your plan - if you can't do that, you will NOT like this game! It is also kind of fiddly - you have to count stuff at the end of every auction. It would be easier if there were a track sheet somewhere to record and display all the numbers (like in Alhambra, where it'd be nice to easily see who has how many of what color tile). In fact, I think I'll make one...
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A mixed bag for me.  I always enjoy blind auctions, so that aspect is great.  I don't like tile-laying a la Carcassone, especially with tiles that were sometimes confusing to me, plus the counting was a bit tedious.  I can see how it has appeal to many, I'm just not one of them.

great, quick, fun blind bidding game with tile-laying puzzles added in.  Lots of pressure to think fast with the closed fist, table-pounding bidding system :)



There is no rich-get-richer problem.  This is the players not the system--geez people, you can look and see whether someone is going to bid high or low and where they are on the flagpole.  It should be very rare that someone can pick up a tile for 1 or zero coins--and zero coins is the only way the "rich get richer" since the game only pays out 1 coin per year per tile. 

There is a moderate amount of luck involved--dependent on how the tiles come out.  Sometimes one player jsut gets lucky and gets a couple tiles each turn which could work equally well--which means they'll pay less than when there are two players who *need* one tile that just came up.

Still a very solid game which I greatly enjoy even though I rarely seem to be able to win!

Oh, O Zoo le Mio - I had high hopes that my wife would love you!  Unfortunately, my matchmaking abilities seem to be equally as bad as my ability to build an attractive zoo.  It's not a bad game, mind you, it's just not one that stands out from the crowd as being particularly exceptional (mechanics-wise that is - the artwork is really quite nice).  To be fair, though, I think my rating is diminished slightly by the fact that I've only played this game with 2 players.  It seems like it would be a more interesting and competitive game with more.  When it comes right down to it, this is a beautifully-produced game that is approachable to casual gamers while simultaneously being fairly strategic, all of which is wrapped up in a very compact and portable little box.  And it's way more fun than "Zooloretto".  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 2/5  Total: 6/10

RATING: 6
[Zoch 'O Zoo Le Mio' 2003 edition] {Zoo, business; blind-bidding, tile-laying, area-majority; optimal 4p} O Zoo le Mio is a thematic development game with rich system. It's simple but very tactical. It is fast-paced and has nice player interaction. All this makes OZLM is a nice gateway game but it should be played with similar intelligence of players. Run-away-leader is an inherit problem of OZLM; esp. when an experienced player plays with newbie.

I prefer a more dynamic play and I like the variant that number of tiles for sale is different each year. I am feeling that the scoring system is not well-tuned. It's not justified that a bench can score so much which makes the bench strategy more prominent.

The components are nice looking although it will be much nicer if animal-shaped markers are provided though this version already has colorful meeples.  English version is over-priced. It's fairer if it's selling below USD20.

The "O Zoo le Mio" version arrived Sept 05.

Played with the 3 of us (dh and ds8) for the first time last night and did not like it as much as I thought I would. Finding all the stars and  trees was a bit of a pain. I love the pieces though and the layout and bidding of the game. Did not realise there would be a pad for scoring on, have not had that in a game in ages. Son, age 8, did get a little bit upset when you took his second place meeple with a tie, hopefully that will improve with more games of Zoo. I think 2 player could be the best way for us to enjoy playing it with him, will try that next. I felt it was slightly confrontational!! 

I want to like it more!!

07 APR 2009 - Played @ GameStorm 11 - Fun bidding game. Use your psychology-fu on your opponents and win! We played it twice and it was quite different both times which is interesting because all of the zoo tiles are the same each time, just a different order. You must have a strategy and stick to it, but have to keep others from getting certain tiles in some cases as well. Quite fun game! Bumped up on my wishlist to MUST HAVE.

I think this is a brain-burner disguised as a light game.  The five-tile lookahead provides an opportunity to value the tiles, prioritize, plan ahead, and do spatial logic problems in your head.

It's rare that one finds a couple of good ideas in a small game that should be made bigger, and O Zoo le Mio is one of those titles.

O Zoo le Mio is too long to be filler but it feels like filler, darnit.

Not as good as I had hoped.  I am not sure why, but I just don't find it to be that fun.

I like the theme and I like tile-laying.  The components are great.  I have tried the other money variants too.

Blind bidding is not my favorite mechanic, but I like other blind bidding games (I.e Fist of Dragonstones). But I feel like there is too little money going in and out. It seems to hover around the same amount. I guess this is good for balance, but there seem to be a lot of ties.

With other variants that inject more money there seems to be a runaway leader problem.

Take all of this with a grain of salt as I haven't played each of the variants enough to really see if my criticisms are true. I'm just not interested enough to do that.

I only keep it because my daughter might like it someday.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 2
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 2
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 3
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 3


Overall - 2

I really like the combination of auctions, tile laying, and majority control. For some reason, I have seemed to enjoy it more than anyone else at the table, even when I lose. I have yet to play it without at least one new player at the table, and I would like to see how it works with a seasoned group before I try the two-coin income variant. That is, if I can get anyone to play it again.

UPDATE: I've played this several times since my post above, using the two income variant exclusively.  Almost all of these games were teaching affairs, but I would like to play with a group who are more familiar with the game so we can take the original income rules into consideration.

Purchased just to be a completist.  O Zoo le Mio has important upgrades that make for better play (park benches, trees and meeple to match the color of attraction).  The animal parks have different names in this edition, and the rules are printed differently, but otherwise this is very much the same game.

Acquired Apr 27, 2005, O Zoo Le Mio version.  Nice combination of Carc, dominoes, with some bidding mechanisms tossed in just for fun.  The components are pretty good and even my 70+ mom likes it.  Definately easy to play, fairly fast, and absorbing enough. I really like this little game.

I really enjoy this game, and all of my friends seem to, as well. There is some amount of strategy, and you need to be aware of how your opponents are building so you know how you should respond, although the game is - for the greater part - nonconfrontational.

Pleasant choice in a short time slot, playable several times in succession.  We've been selecting it when we don't feel so ambitious but still want some mental activity.  My interest has grown as we've learned more about how to play well.

Perhaps a key element of its attraction is the careful resource management required for the bidding tokens, which are quite tightly constrained. Players must carefully select which tiles offered in the first round they really wish to compete for.  Buying wrecklesly could leave you short in the next round.

Dominating a color/attraction category wins points like Alhambra, but the comprison is misleading since the colors only augment when connected orthogonally.

RATING: 5.5
Much more depth to this than I had been led to believe by BGG comments.

Keeping track of how much money everybody else have is essential (and easy - only 3 low numbers, one for each other player's cash) - otherwise, the blind auctions are just a guessing game, without much strategy.

Also, when the new tiles for a bidding round are turned up, take the time and evaluate which ones fit into your zoo, which ones you want to bid high on, and which ones you'll bid on only to prevent somebody else from getting them too cheap.

Be aware of the money curve through the game - everybody starts with a bunch of money, but incomes are very low at the start.  Income however gradually increase throughout the game - so 1 money is worth less in the last round than in the middle round.

I enjoyed this and look forward to playing it again.

RATING: 6
Rated after 12 games, some with 2, some with 3 and some with 4 players. Nice game and ok theme for most casual players. I personally don't like auction games, but in this game the auction part is quite simple and you learn pretty fast how much to offer. Other part is the tile phase, which might be even trickier. I like the nice tie-break system in auctions.

The game is good, but if someone gets a good start, it might be quite hard for others to catch him/her. Also the first two rounds are little bit meaningless point-wise, but of course have importance because of the income and founding the zoo. Dropped the rating to 6 after the latest game.

In O Zoo le Mio, each player is a zoo manager constructing their own zoo by bidding on and then placing tiles that depict different animal exhibits and walking paths around the exhibits.The goal is to attract more visitors to your zoo. Visitors are attracted by large zoo areas of the different types of animals - apes, mammals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures. Tiles also have walking paths that must be lined up, and making a closed loop walking path scores a bonus. Having the most trees in a zoo also gives a bonus.

An very interesting blend of tile-laying, blind-bidding, and area-majority.  Don't be fooled by the theme, this game is deeper than it looks!  Great bits too (Zoch edition.)

How to describe this game?  It's an auction game with territorial control, and money management.  It was also surprisingly difficult for me to understand the only time I've played the game (and this is supposed to be a kids' game!), and I lost by a 130-point margin.  I'll have to play this again to see if this was just a fluke.

Interesting game, but there is a lot finicky calculating after every auction. By that I mean, "Wait, I have 1 more mammal in my enclosure, so I get one of your people and his one man, too. Now let's count up bushes." We found ourselves occasionally missing changes in popularity.

Bid for rectangular tiles you must play into your zoo setup by matching paths drawn on the tiles. If you can connect ends of tiles that have similar zoo exhibits (dominoes-style) then you gain visitors which score points. 5 rounds, scoring increasing each round.

Packs a bunch of tough decisions into a very short timeframe.  Very pleasing aesthetically, and I love the placement planning. But I wish there was more cash in the game, for finer bidding gradations. Also, the more I play, the more I think the rich-get-richer problem is real, and I'm not sure the game is so good that I'm willing to take the effort to test and adopt a variant.

Players each manage a zoo in this blind-bidding / tile-placement / area-majority game with great components and quick play time.  Points can be scored in a variety of ways, and there are different paths to winning.  Players must be careful not to get too far behind the leader in this one, or else the leader's income can make them very hard to catch.

I researched the geek for the next best two player game to play with my fiancee.  I scoured the sites, reading all the "choose your own adventure geeklists for 2-player games", Tom Vassal' lists, paging through every game in the top 600 to see which games people had recommended for 2 players, and I came across this game.  It even says its an excellent 2 player auction game!  Long story short, she did not like it. What a letdown.  Still, I love the excuse I had to use the geek.

The way income is generated seemed like it needed to be adjusted.  We played with a fixed income and it seemed much improved.  The auction mechanic wasn't as good as others I've seen, but the tile placement aspect is fantastic.  My only other complaint is that the artwork is awful, and the tube version looks stupid sitting on a shelf next to other games.

A very creatively themed game.  It feels like there's a rich-get-richer problem in the game, that's best combatted by playing with experienced players aware of the issue. Still it's colourful, fun, and entertaining.

Hate the blind bidding; unimpressed with the tile laying and the majority aspect; the game is totally unsurprising as a 2-player game.  Doing the same routine for 4 rounds just bored me to death.

Rating based on one playing.  Simple to learn, rich and complex to play.  I really enjoy it...so the rating may go up with subsequent playings.  Rating update after two more playings:  I like this game the more I play it!  It's so cool how simple this game seems, but how complex the auctions *and* tile placement can be (not to mention your attempts at long-term planning because you know what tiles are next to be auctioned). Update: rating dropped; once you get behind, there seems little that you can do to catch up.  And that's just not fun.

I really wanted to like this game, especially since it had a pretty good look to it.  The pieces were nice and I like games that come in a round container.  But the game really didn't work for me.  Too much luck in the drwing phase and not enough player interaction.  It was also too "fiddley" for the kind of game it pretends to be.  I would say, "Play this game before you buy it."

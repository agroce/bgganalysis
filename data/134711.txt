GoC is a nice little game, with very simple mechanics and not so simple decisions. The game will most likely appeal to not so experienced gamers and it may become boring after a few plays, but the beautiful miniatures make up for that. The KS extras makes add replay value and increase the decision making space.

Another game which we had not managed to play this year. Finally got it out as there were 7 of us and I think the game really shines when there is a larger crowd. While there is still downtime, what others do affects you so you have vested interest to continue to monitor the situation and think of alternative plans.

We played with the action cards too which I think is a blast with more people since there is now uncertainty involved as people can switch out cards and add to their influences through so many other ways.

The expansion and the board to me is a must in my opinion.

This game was not at all on my wishlist.  I didn't even know it existed until I walked into a game store in Las Vegas while on vacation and the store owner pulled me into a game with some of the other customers.  I decided that even though it's not my favorite, I didn't have any games like it and it seemed easy and quick.  I had a good time playing with strangers so I am pretty sure I will enjoy it as a starter game with my friends.  It's a small package, quick to setup, easy to understand, and over quickly.  I need a good selection of games with those attributes to get people playing quickly in groups.

Good filler game.  Doesn't take too long but definitely has some meat to the gameplay.

You have to manage the placement and counting meticulously in order to be successful, but you don't have to suffer from AP to do it.

In Guilds of Cadwallon, each turn cards are placed in a grid.  The cards are mostly comprised of various guilds which give a certain number of points for claiming them, and give a certain amount of influence for placing next to them in the placement phase.

Once the grid is laid out, players take turns placing influence to the board one at a time.  When you place influence, you simply place one of your figures on the table between two cards, with the goal of having more influence next to a card than any other player.

Once there is no more room on the grid to place more influence, players claim all of the cards where they had more influence than any other player.

At the end of the game, you'll score points for the cards you've claimed, with more points being scored if you managed to claim several cards in a guild (you'll want to focus on getting several cards in a couple guilds, rather than getting cards for a bunch of different guilds).

That's it in a nutshell.  There are also a few different card types that you'll get other than guild cards, such as one time use special actions, wild cards, cards that are worth negative points, etc.  Overall, just a very simple game of area majority and set collecting.

Very light Euro worker placement game with minis instead of Meeples and some extra flourishes thrown in. Light party game. Fun with 2-3 players. 
Needs to be played with the variant cards for longevity.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2
This game is pretty much the worst of all worlds.

It wants to be precise and calculating, but the chaotic special cards can ruin all plans and the timing of when the guilds come out is immensely important and completely random. 

It wants to be set in some fantasy world, but is just a dry abstract exercise in counting. 

It wants to be good, but it sucks.

Light and fast, but with a few decisions with the "Action" cards.  I'd want to play it quite a few times before I started using the Condition cards (which, fundamentally, change/remove basic rules) or the Contract cards (which give additional goals).  However, those card-types do add some life to what I imagine is a game that might get tired sooner rather than later.

Fine idea, but the cards were either different flavours of chaos or samey-ness.  I hated the negative guild, only because it shrunk the decision space of where it was interesting to place a dude.

Guilds of Cadwallon is a nice little area control game that doesn't take up too much time and is very easy to pick up and play.

While the game is rated for 2 - 4 players, and will play perfectly fine with 4 players, a 4 player game will only allow to place 3 units per round, comparatively with 2 players it allows players to place 6 units per round so it feels a little more strategic and puts a little more control in the area control element of the game.

There are hidden goal cards and the artwork and miniatures are well done.  It would have been nice to see larger areas for higher player counts but I know Cool Mini or Not saved that for their 5-8 player expansion as part of the KickStarter campaign.  Cool Mini or Not have done a nice job on production for Guilds of Cadwallon.

Pofonegyszerű, befolyásszerzős játék, ami kicsit hasonlít nekem az FFG-s Masquesra. Talán itt kevesebb a kitolás. Nagyon jó ötlet a befolyásszerzésnél, hogy a szomszédos kártya erőssége határozza meg az emberünk erejét. 
Furcsa ilyet mondani, hogy úgy éreztem, hogy ha hosszabb lenne, akkor kevésbé lenne zavaró benne a szerencse. Kicsit pontosabban akkor nem lenne akkora szerencse benne. 3-4 forduló alatt egyszerűen nem tud szerintem kibontakozni eléggé. Nem lehet eléggé ráállni valami stratégiára, mert már vége is. Így meg hatalmas eltérések lettek a pontokban néha.

Not such a bad game. Has an interesting Area Influence mechanic where players attempt to take tiles by gaining strength from surrounding tokens. In that, the game plays smoothly. As the turns continue through a round, decisions become fairly arbitrary. There are special powers that can be granted by action cards, but they usually just come off random and as a nuisance when played. There are extra score cards for players as well to achieve, but they are variable enough that some goals become nigh impossible to achieve while other players just fall into the luck. Not a bad game and different enough that it's memorable. Not one I'd buy but I'd play it again as a filler.

Great game for when you don't have much time to play. Easy to transport. It captures the theme well with easy to learn mechanics. There are even extra elements to add a little more depth to the game after your first few play throughs.

Great filler game. When teaching to other people, I always reference it to tic-tac-toe. Which is weird because the game plays NOTHING like it. The only thing that is similar is that the "board" is in a 3x3 grid of tiles.

The theme is a bit pasted on because each player is playing a different faction (dwarves, goblins, ect.) and actually gets a handful of some very detailed miniatures, but I in no way feel like I'm being that race. Don't get me wrong though, if they just used pawns instead...I don't think I'd care much for the game. Long story short, with your minis you're vying for control of the different tiles.

The tiles are also subpar. If they were thicker quality like 'Forbidden Island' that would be awesome. Instead they're flimsy card stock. This game would also benefit from an actual board to put your tiles on.

* Kickstarted! *

City Of Thieves done with tiles and figures instead of just cards. It's quick and easy to learn, with lots of strategy involved. But it needs to be a bigger grid for 4 (go 4x4 instead of 3x3). The Kickstarter version adds a physical board to help you, and it feels necessary –– while the added cards give the game more options.

BIG PLUS: ease of play, options
MINUS: not really exciting for long periods
HUGE MINUS: non-Kickstarter versions really lose out

A simple game that suffers from an almost embarrasing case of obvious imbalance: chances are the 1st player will win the hand! Perhaps it needed more play testing? I don't know, and - in all honesty - I don't care; which is a shame because it feels like it could have been something much much better (see, for example, Samurai the Card Game)

What a great filler, with a decent enough amount of planning necessary that will propel you to victory.
Nice options, too.
The Contract cards are a fun twist..secret info is always a blast, in this type of game.
Plays really quickly, and with a good amount of "surprise" at who actually handled their pawns well enough to win.

I'm happy to own it!

I admit it, I am a Cadwallon fanboy, and I will buy just about anything with a Cadwallon theme, even if that theme is the lightest of veneers on an otherwise straight mechanics style game. The Guilds of Cadwallon is definitely one of those lightest of veneers style game. But god dammit that's a good looking veneer. The components for the game are done rather well, for the most part. The overally graphic design could have been done with a little bit more attention to playing the game, and not JUST the Cadwallon theme (and this is coming from the Cadwallon fanboy). Some of the elements on the district cards could have been amde to stand out more visually, as it is now you relaly can't focus on much with these cards, unless you know exactly what you are looking for. The rulebook seems straightforward, and has great examples of play, until you throw in the extra loot from the KS campaign and then apparently it all goes to shit. The rules for the extra guilds, the guild backers, how many cards to use in larger games, do the extra guild district cards could as a "second set", etc. These are all questions that the publishers decided to leave on two small cards, and not make very clear in the rulebook. Remember CMoN, its always better to err on the side of caution. All of the rules for the extra components should have been clearly laid out in the rulebook, and if someone didn't have the extra componenets they didn't need to use those rules. And finally the miniatures could have been done better. They are so small, and lack so much detail (except for the orange pieces) that most of them just seem like a dollop of plastic with bumps on a base.  
All that being said this game is pretty neat for the light filler game. I completely played the scoring incorrectly the first time I played because of the confusion with the extra guilds, and guild backers. The game offers interesting tactical decisions each turn, and the action cards offer a nice Take That condiment to the game. The scoring is really obtuse, and if you focus too much on your end game scoring you will probably be miserable the whole game. If this didn't have a Cadwallon theme I would probably rate this a 6 or 7, but the Cadwallon theme definitely puts it higher on the ratings scale. You don't like that? Sue me. 

Now if only I can really figure out what I need, when I need it, and how do I need it, i would give this a 9.

a clever little game that uses the space between cards as the allies and streets of cadwallon, a nice bit of flavour. The game plays quickly and easily.

The kickstarter edition comes with twice as much stuff as you need. Playing with all that extra stuff can bloat the game, so don't use it.

The core concept and gameplay is sound, though a lot of the city setups and placements dictate a pretty clear path of optimal play, despite the changes the Contract and Conditions cards try to implement.

My hope is that alternate city setups will alleviate this issue, as I can see this game not having much shelf life as is.

Flavor/theme are poorly implemented and have almost no bearing on the actual gameplay or decisions made, which is a bit of a shame as I've been a longtime fan of Confrontation, Rackham, and Cadwallon.

I've played to few games to put a definite rating on it, but so far it's been more fun than I expected. It's quick to set up, plays fast and hardly takes up any space on the shelf. The contract cards seem a bit unbalanced, and there's a bunch of cards that works like rule variants that I don't quite understand the point of, but all in all it's a decent travel game/filler.
(I've only played two player games, though, and I suspect it to get worse with three and pretty much pointless with four.)

What really draws me into this game is how fast the three phases play. Although I haven't played it with any of the optional cards or rules. Great minis also.

An odd hybrid that doesn't sit well with me. It's trying to build on the Cadwallon fantasy theme but what we get is a worker placement area majority type Euro with little theme linking or development. Then we get a very calculating game - determine what can be won immediately with one placement and what will need two placements, and what the chances are of getting that second placement given what other people have collected and what else is on offer - and then overlay that with action cards that screw everything up after people have placed their workers. Diminishing any enjoyment from satisfactory play in the calculation mode. So the game is too slow for the chaos that eventually presents, and too slow to allow the theme to come alive. Plus the order in which cards come out can be game determining (is the set you're collecting coming out one card at a time, or do the remainder all come out at once giving you no chance of collecting the remainder). It plays ok given all that, satisfactory components, etc, but it seems an ill fit to its time-niche and genre.

I nice quick game with some strategy. I'd suggest to always play with the condition and contract cards to get the most from the game. The Support example in the rules isn't the greatest but once you figure that out the game plays fairly smooth.

A disappointing lack of game given the sheer amount of great components. Awesome minis, lots of chips and beautiful high-quality cards, all packed in a neat little hard box, and with all that the game is just a boring puzzle that plays itself.

Interesting worker placement area control mechanic (if that is the correct description?)

Nice minis, great card art, good build quality, no complaints from this one :)

Would suggest larger games with certain groups only because it can slow the game down while people think.

The rules for larger games need work too.

A successful Kickstarter funded game.

My edition includes 4 more guilds and agent pawns associated with the guild, Militia and Personality pack (5 additional Militia and 4 additional personality cards), Additional duplicate set of Action Cards, 5 additional Contract Cards to the base game (total of 10), Guild Backer Cards (helps add to score), Multiplayer Rules cards.

I liked it better on my first play than second, which is a bad sign. I think that this game has strategic and tactical elements which seem to be at odds with each other. There isn't enough information to make informed tactical decision to fuel the strategic planning. I just felt as though I had very little control over my own destiny in the games I played. The core mechanic isn't terrible, but the actual gameplay felt random to me.

This game is actually quite interesting in some ways - it's almost an abstract, as you have perfect information on each round of play (but don't know what cards will turn up in later rounds). Unfortunately, this can lead to quite a lot of AP, and the game isn't sufficiently interesting to make up for this. Essentially you're placing "workers" between cards to try to gain these cards, where cards are worth VPs at the end of the game, many combos being worth more than the sum of their parts, and some cards having an in-game use to alter the rules in your favour. I won't object to playing this every once in a while, but it's really not something I can get excited by.

I think Guilds of Cadwallon is an absolutely excellent game. It's small and compact, but has a lot of gameplay inside. It's simple to explain, easily picked up by newer players - but still has a good level of strategy involved. It plays quickly, so you can get multiple games in during a session. The cards and pieces look good. It's quick to setup and pack away.

Probably not a game to plan a night around, but definitely a super opener or filler game. Lots to like here, for me.

RATING: 5
The area-majority mechanic (where your influence is based on what is across the road that your token is standing on) is interesting in theory.  In practice, I found that most plays were obvious, there was a bit too much luck, and a tad more kingmaking than I'd like.  The mechanics work and there is a spark of insight here, but the game doesn't come together in a memorable way.

RATING: 6
This is a simple set collection mechanic mixed with an are control aspect for gaining parts of said set.  

Im a huge fan of the Art of Cadwallon, but have been disappointed with some of the early games set in that world.  

With the price point and simplicity, Guilds turns out to be pretty enjoyable.  The event cards are crucial and could be conveyed as a little broken, but the game is lite enough that just knowing you shouldn't let players stock pile the actions mitigates that advantage.

 This is a fairly quick and lite game, but it is also fun. The game offers a small amount of interesting decisions. The action cards add just enough uncertainty to make the game engaging. This is all when playing on the base 3x3 grid. When playing on a bigger grid, the game really opens up, the decisions become more interesting, and the game is even more enjoyable.

Lay a grid of cards, then all players take turns placing their beasts inbetween the cards to capture the cards they want, in theory to win, you need to capture the same type of guild cards. Once all players have placed their beasts, you then work out who has won which card. Simple enough, with plenty of tweaks depending on the cards you are winning and can use in subsequent rounds.
Played once with six players, and I really didn't take enough notice of what other players were doing, and also hadn't been told all the rules so was aiming for incorrect cards. Good experience, relatively short and simple.

Players place workers between cards laid out in a 3x3 (or 4x4, 5x5...) grid. Whomever has the most influence on a given card collects it -- some provide special actions in future turns and most score set-collection points.

It's a clever game, but scoring is a little fiddly and the actions add some unwanted chaos. What should be quick and elegant ends up feeling overwrought.

Note that it is inconceivable that the game could improve with more players, so the 5-8 player expansion is particularly dire and should be avoided at all costs. Expansion cards can be used with fewer players but make the game worse even then.

So far I'm not impressed.  The guild colors are totally different that the figures (mint green?  WTF?).  The little bingo chips seem equally cheap.

I also find there is a lack of info about how to mix the bonus cards in with the others.

Played it with 5 strategic players and really enjoyed the decisions.  Just need a MUCH better rulebook.

Considering I wasn't expecting much,
this game delivers quite a bit of gameplay and replay value: the mechanics are familiar tho in a new combination
(Tile/worker placement similair to 'Samurai' and Scoring mechanism reminiscent of 7 wonders 'Tech' scoring). 
 The game plays fast enough to justify several rounds in an evening. 
 W/ the kickstarter extras, it scales well between 2 and six players (and theoretically adds 7-8, but I doubt it would be much fun above six).
The optional Condition and Contract Cards add significant flavor, but the base game is strong enough that is still enjoyable if you forget to use 'em.

Bonus Points: the Kids both like this game a lot!

(using the 5-8 player edition)

It was a great game and didn't feel like it was too heavy on thought. We played the vanilla version (no contract or blue rules changing cards) and it went pretty smoothly. I expected it to grind to a halt on the last part of the round, but you're not stuck with too many decisions.

That being said, the larger player game went better than expected and I feel it might be a better experience with more players than fewer.

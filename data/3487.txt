can play this game over and over again.
after each game we make a minor change to our decks,trying to get the upper hand.
so our deck are never "killer decks" these always a way to beat them.

I like how they translated the style of warfare of the Battletech Universe to a Cardgame. It is really complex, but that is also the biggest drawback. It results in Analysis Paralysis for me, because you have to think through a lot of steps to be able to decide which action will be the best. So it just doesn't make me feel good while playing.

One of the least expensive CCG to collect and have a good game on. Love the 'runs'. Artwork is average, but game system is sound for the universe this game is build upon.

RATING: 5.5
One of the better ccgs produced during the ccg boom. The Battletech ccg is quite fun but is prone to long games. Like many popular ccgs the rules quickly ballooned to epic proportions as new card abilities and types were introduced.

RATING: 7.7
Another one I played the heck out of in high school and recently re-discovered. It wasn't much more than magic:the gathering with more interesting combat, but sometimes that's good enough.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
One of the better CCGs out there, this is similar to Magic, but with much more emphasis on tactics.  I quit playing right about the time Wizards released a new edition, incompatible with all previous cards, and then stopped supporting the game entirely.

A bad CCG, but a great cardgame. It's a bad CCG because the more tactical player can often win with the crappier deck, so Rare-hunters might be turned off by that.

The definitive collectible card game. Unlike Magic, your hand 'doesnt play you.' Discontinued years ago, hard to find. Build massive mechs, conduct covert operations, airstrikes, utilize artillery. Many ways to attack, plot and screw over your opponent. Works best as a 1 on 1. Clan Smoke Jaguar and Clan Wolf are my babies. On the side i use House Steiner and House Marik.

Absolutely loved this one back when it came out.  I'd play games with my Brother-in-Law and thought it was funner than MTG.  It may have been the setting and the ammo/armor mechanics; I'm not a huge fantasy fan.  Ended up selling what I had  on eBay for some cash.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
A fun card version of the board game.  Not great, but pretty good for fans.   

UPDATE:  More fun than I remembered.  Am exploring multiplayer rule sets now, with an extra stockpile.  My four-year-old son and I are using the cards as a combination Math and "War" game.

UPDATE II:  Finally played Team Multiplayer, with standards decks for each player and then shared Team resource decks of 25 cards each.  First team to destroy two decks (both player decks or a player deck and the shared resource deck) wins.  Great fun.  Rating of playing like this is about a "9."

I really love this game, even though I only play it online and don't own the cards.  Actually, that's a big part of it.  Online, you have four of every card.  Maybe only a 5 in real life with limited cards.  Anyway, this game is great because of all the different attacks.  You aren't just attacking an abstract life total.  You can attack something under construction, a resource, a specific mech, or the other guy's deck.  Then add in the initiative and damage system to make the fighting interesting, and every game is really fun.  Oh, and the cost for mechs being discounted by different land types is brilliant.  Picking between a heavy that always costs 8 vs one that costs 12 at start, but could cost 5 if you have his three land types is really cool.

Was innovative back in the day, with the ability to basically attack anything, not just your generic opponent's life points.  Probably helped that it was a Richard Garfield design.

It was an acceptable conversion of the boardgame to the CCG when the CCG's where at peak hype. The last expansion and the reformulation of the basic set killed it in two strokes!!!

RATING: 7
Allways had fun playing this game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Even in the base game and early expansions it was possible almost every game to bury an opponent without their being able to stop or reply to another player(s) attacks in the very first turn(s) of a match. This situation got even worse with subsequent expansions.

Likewise, some cards are so 'tuned' in with how the game plays that they render better than half if not two-thirds or more of the several hundred individual cards essentially worthless unless a player deliberately wants a themed faction deck or some such. However, that type of deck will assuredly lose badly every single game without massive levels of fluke luck.

In fact, there are surprisingly few cards to use for what most would consider an "effective" deck.

Such 'must haves' include;
Black Market Connections
Comguard Response Team (Inner Sphere)
Elementals (Clan)
Hidden Resources
Solaris Contacts (To put in play, for free, uber-Unique pilots.)
Think Tank
uber-Uniques (Mostly restricted to a single faction, like Davion.)
War Funds

With a maximum of 60 cards in a deck, and 23'ish each of resources & units gone off the top, that doesn't make for a whole lot of variety when multiple copies of the aforementioned are needed.

You are in fact then in a mutual race for an over-powering card; but admittedly this is a vicious circle inherent to most any game nowadays.

Considering this was put out be the company that produced M:TG the lack of balance and horridly overpowered/over-used cards approaches insane levels of boggle.

Even compared to Sim City, Jyhad/V:TES, and Star Trek:TNG 1E, this is probably the worst CCG I tried regarding getting an acceptable spread of card types for basic gameplay in booster packs/starter decks.

And most of the art.... makes the TRO:3055's color section look good... no small feat.

RATING: 6.5
Bought

Very similar to MtG. The game died relatively quickly due to WotC constantly nerfing cards or more often banning them outright. None of the offending cards was anywhere near as powerful as many of the cards playable in Type I MtG. The lack of a tournament level that permitted the early adopters to use the cards they had traded for in the aftermarket was inexcusable.

I lost 60 of my best cards when I left them behind at the Wizards of the Coast store in the UW district of Seattle while I was there for a tournament.  I still have some cards, and look forward to playing with my son when he gets a little older.  He will love giant, fighting robots.

Only CCG I spent any real time on, so not sure how it compares to others.  We used house rules to get multiplayer games.  At first deck building was fun, but really determines game outcomes more than in game decisions.

Pool of 2000+ cards, plus the following built decks:
-Wolf (high speed, aggressive)
-Jade Falcon (missiles, pilots)
-Ghost Bear (high armor)
-Smoke Jaguar (really big mechs)
-Stone Lion (anti-location artillery)
-Rasalhague (direct damage)
-Comstar (mercenary support)
-Kurita (c3, pilots)
-Liao (subterfuge)
-Davion (jump)
-Steiner (overheat)
-Marik (anti-mecha artillery)

Instead of big combos, Battletech CCG has cards that slightly sinergize together in an obvious way. Building decks is easier than in other CCGs and gameplay feels more tactic than strategic. As a result, gameplay remains interesting even after the game is long dead. 

Also, the game is very thematic and integrates very well a lot detail an variety present in original Battletech.

This is one of the best dead CCGs to play.

Magic with giant robots. Most blatant ever clone.

That was my original comment and maybe it's a bit unfair, but it is more similar to magic than any other game I have come across.

I was not going to get into this. I bought a starter and a couple of booster just to see what it was all about. then I went into Forbiden Planet and they had boxes of booster for £9.99 each. Three different sets as well, so I got a box of each. 

the fact that even with three boxes of boosters I still can't build very powerful decks reminded me of what a money sink CCGs are. Still it's an enjoyable game and I have enough cards to try a few different ideas.

RATING: 7
Fun game, more tactical than MTG.  Couldn't get too many people to play it, it's always Magic, Magic, Magic.

Score is probably skewed for my love of Mechwarrior.

The games goal is to run your opponent's deck out of cards.  The deck is considered a 'site', as is any other  resources or anything "under construction."

The "under construction" mechanic was really interesting.  As you begin using resources to pay the card's cost, it sits face down with glass beads placed for each resource paid.  You could fake your opponent out by overconstructing and making their eyes widen with the extra beads and think it was a big mech, diverting them to attack while it was defenseless.

The mechs come in the speeds, Slow/Medium/Fast, and when attacking sites, can only be blocked by something if equal or faster speed. 

You can enhance your mech with a variety of equipment and pilots, have political influences, and many other tactical options.

BLUFFING. Probably the most tactical CCG I have ever played.  It uses a lot of concepts from Magic: The Gathering but executes them better.  You can make multiple attacks per round, different creatures can be set to guard or patrol, everything is a potential target for attack, etc.

RATING: 7
Strong similarities to M:tg. A good game that never really caught on. 

Initial problems with the game - broken cards, broken deck construction rules. 

The game was graphically redesigned. WOTC did a nice job, but the plug was pulled a few sets after the re-design. 

Compelling mechanics 

Speed. Mechs have three speeds: fast, medium, slow. Fast mechs intercept Fast or slower mechs. Medium mechs can intercept medium or slow mechs, Slow mechs can intercept slow mechs. 

Building: Resource are tapped to produce build points on cards. When the card has build tokens equal to (or greater) than its cost it can be readied. Players have two deploys per turn - so you have to choose between increasing your resource base or putting out more mechs (There are other card types that can be built too. Just using mech as a generalization)

Resources: There are 5, just like M:tg. Cards have a cost. It can be a straight cost, like 5 or it can be a composit cost.

Cards with composit cost may read 5 3p 1t. The card requires 9 points to build it. If you have a P resource you don't have to pay 3p, so your cost would be 6.

Win Condition: The goal is to run your opponent out of cards ( just like the M:tg Millstone deck)

I enjoyed playing this game. You had to buy the boosters to get the most out of the game. The starters that first came with the game were hard to play with = (The cards did not play will togeather). My friends and I were able to play campaigns of taking over planets just by setting up the decks for operations and forces involved. We had some GREAT games.

I'm not much for CCgs but this was ok.  I had a terrible fortune with not getting any mechs and my opponent tore me to shreds.  Still, after getting the hang of it, played well enough.  Would not say 'no' if asked to play again but other stuff I might select first.

Excellent CCG, played regularly! Sadly this gem of a CCG is regularly overlooked and underappreciated because it's not MTG.

If you are interested in selling or trading please forward me a list of the rares you have available and I will reciprocate.

Another awesome design by Garfield. You can recognize elements of VTES & Netrunner here and there but I feel its more versatile than both when every element aligns. 

I've always felt that the only thing working against this game are the lax VTES-style deckbuilding rules with no restrictions on the amount of copies. Its way too easy to build a cheesy deck with nothing but endless swarms of 3 or 4 different mechs and still have a viable game. I would advise to impose some sort of copy restriction to enforce better deck variety. Those subterfuge cards are there for a reason dammit!

Only interested in the Commander's Edition and Crusade.  And even then, not really interested in this one until the boxes make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins (but wanted to go ahead and add it to my list so that I do not forget) and I can obtain in bulk.  Looking to pay about 16 cents per unplayed (or played but mint) booster (a bit more for starters) [or offer 16 cents per in trade value if trading].  Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).

Update 2009.08.25. Finally played a game as part of my CCG Journey. We enjoyed it pretty well. The theme feels well implemented to me, and I like a lot of the little things done differently in this game compared to other CCGs. Looking forward to trying this some more.

I have played this only with two starter decks and it&#039;s really difficult to rate a CCG after playing with so few cards (after all the deck building is a huge part of any CCG). I did however find the mechanics to be good (altough not very original) and I do remember liking the game.

[u]Summarized Opinion:[/u] A solid CCG I only played for a short while.

[u]My Rating Explained:[/u] Good game (even if I'll never play it again).

[u]Verbose Assessment:[/u]

One of the better CCGs I played, and I played quite a few. The game flows well, and offers interesting tactical decisions.

As with many other CCGs, interest in this game just kinda petered out for the people I played with, killing the game. Not many CCGs survive the show-down with the gargantuan M:tG.

Still, if you get the opportunity to pick up some cards on the cheap AND you have someone interested to play it with you, I recommend to give it a try.

I am a long-time Battletech fan, and I really liked this game.  Unfortunately, broken cards (and mechanics) in the expansions drove people away.... and the absolute broken nature of the final set (with the accompanying grumbling by the playtesters who argued against it) killed it.  From what I understand, WotC was going to have to hand the game over to FASA who licensed the property at that time, and was trying with their own game, Shadowrun, and likely decided to just kill it.  Maybe I'm a cynic.  Such a shame!

Battletech CCG is one of those weird games. The kind that I can't really describe after playing it. Not because it was a game that so totally blew me away that I found the experience indescribable. No, I mean more in the way of so decidedly average that nothing stood out.

It's an okay game, but the Mechs don't make up for uninteresting gameplay. Even the reset did nothing to help. There's a reason it tanked. Just another game in the "me too" stage of CCGs.

Battletech is very fun. It's similar to Magic, except it has a way better and more involved combat system. What's bad about it is that sometimes it can be a bit too focused on combat, which can become a bit monotonous. However, I really love the setting and storyline.

It's a shame WotC stopped making it, but I still play with friends a bit. Also, I know a lot of fans have made new cards for it. One person made something called "Battletech Galaxies", which was based on the ccg and used the cards, but was almost an entire new game...

RATING: 6
This is one of the better card games to come out of the 90's post-Magic CCG craze. It has quite a few interesting mechanics and does a great job of capturing the Battletech Universe. I particularly like how resources can accumulate from turn to turn (in the form of build points), allowing you the flexibility to build towards large units right away instead of having to wait until the end of the game to acquire enough resources. I also like the tactical flexibility of being able to attack targets other than the opponent's life total. It's a well designed and very engaging game.

This is still pretty expensive for being a dead game, but if you can get a deal on it, there's a lot of fun to be had...

I've never been much of TCG/CCG guy, but I am a giant robot guy so that got me into it. That said it has hands down one of the best mechanics in a CCG I've ever played. It can be finicky based on your deck, but once you get a hang of your style of play and deck build accordingly, it' massive fun.

If Magic had not been so prominent in my youth, I would have loved to play this game more often. The artwork, the mechanics, the asymmetrical Clans vs. Inner Sphere mechs...you couldn't go wrong. It felt truly thematic building up your resources and mechs and other widgets then taking them on hit-and-run raids on your opponent's cards. 

I liked that you could use all sorts of tactics to remove your opponents cards from play as well as needing to remove cards from his deck instead of having an artificial life total. 

Miss playing this game.

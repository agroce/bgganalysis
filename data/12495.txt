An enjoyable game where the theme and mechanics are very well suited for each other. The randomness quotient might be a bit high, but the game is so fun that I'm not sure it matters. Avoid with three players unless you really love it. I think four players might be the sweet spot... will have try this one again soon. UPDATE: Four is an excellent number for this game. I really enjoy this, but I am SO terrible. I do want to keep playing though, which is always the sign of a good game.

My version is the new Asmodee edition (Fire & Axe). Nice looking game, light rules and duration of 1-1,5 hours. Game developes while playing it, so late-game sagas are more complicated and rewarding, which makes the game even more interesting.

This game offers some fun. Especially the beginning of the game works well, where you get the feeling that there is a lot to do. The endgame kills it a bit, however. Luck is a huge factor, in other words, the game is a dice fest.

A delicate balance of raiding, settling, and trading.  Lots of decisions to be made -- not complex ones, but a lot of planning and strategy.  I played it once and it seemed easy to learn, but would take a few plays to learn to master.  Very much a Eurogame.  It did seem like there were some cards in the deck that shouldn't be used because it creates an unfair advantage.

RATING: N/A
Played Fire & Axe 3 times now.  Only one game was not enjoyable, but that was not because of the game directly, but because I was gaming with a couple of cry babies.  Which brings me to the one complaint I do have for the game...failing dice rolls after one to several game turns of investment does hurt.  If you are going to play this game, and hope to enjoy it, play with gamers who are not going to throw hissy fits each time the dice do not go their way.

For me, I really enjoyed the game.  Failed dice rolls did hurt, but the successes were awesome.  I am willing to take the good with the bad and enjoy the game even when losing.  When playing with like minded gamers, Fire & Axe is a winner!

Very fun game of Viking plundering and settling across Europe and the surrounding area. Different and unique theme is a real plus in a time of overused, boring themes. Different ways to gain points and therefore multiple paths to victory keeps everyone on their toes and in the game throughout. The nice components are certainly a nice bonus. Not overly complicated and would likely work well as a family game.

Fun and interesting Viking game.  Thought it wouldn't be very complex with only the trading, raiding and settling, but was a puzzle to figure out what to focus on and how to beat others to the saga goals.  Actually more enjoyable than I thought it would be.  Really enjoy the look of the board and components.

After one game, I give it a 7. This was really fun. I only played it with 2 other people. It is essentially a pick up and deliver game with a Viking theme (some attacking and settling coastal villages). I'm wondering if I'll like it with more people playing - i.e., more of a direct conflict with other players (feeling more like an untrustworthy Viking).

RATING: 9
Das Spiel hat einen hohen Unterhaltungswert, wenn man sich auf seine Besonderheit, die vom ihm "erzählte" Geschichte,  einlassen kann. Es ist nicht durchgängig planbar, weist vielmehr eine Reihe von Unwägbarkeiten auf. Bei Angriffen (Raubzug, Besiedelung) wird gewürfelt, wobei die erforderliche Würfelzahl durch vorherigen Handel um einen Punkt gesenkt werden kann. Es gibt Runenkarten, die einen nicht unwesentlichen Einfluss auf das Spiel haben können, der sowohl aus der Kartenfunktion (z.B. Übernahme einer fremden Besiedelung, Zeitersparnis beim Beladen im Winterlager pp) als auch daraus folgt, dass nach jeder Nutzung einer solchen Karte sich auch die Wettereinflüsse auf die Schifffahrt ändern können. Hat man es bei seinen Seereisen besonders eilig und versucht deshalb, in seinem Spielzug möglichst weit zu reisen, führt das je nach Region zu -teilweise kalkulierbaren- Verlusten bei Mannschaft und/oder mitgeführten Handelswaren. Letzteres kann einen aber auch unverhofft treffen, wenn eine unvorhergesehene Wetteränderung eintritt.

Stellt man sich beim Spielen vor, man führe als Jarl Schiff und Leute mit Zuversicht und Mut auf einer Fahrt voller Abenteuer durch die Fährnisse des Wikingerlebens mit all seinen Unwägbarkeiten, so erlebt man ein spannendes Spiel und eine Geschichte, die sich nach glücklicher Heimkehr im Langhaus zur Erbauung der Daheimgebliebenen erzählen lässt. Wer dagegen das Spiel nur als eine Sammlung von Spielmechaniken ansieht, sich auf Fiktion nicht einlassen kann, wird eher sein Schicksal bejammern und trübsinnig beklagen, das Spiel triefe nur so von Zufallselementen.

Fazit: Kein Spiel für Planer, sondern ein Fest für "Bauchspieler", wunderbar!

Reasons not to like Fire & Axe; there isn't much player interaction and there is a significant luck factor (though that probably balances out over the length of the game).  Nonetheless, I found this game quite engrossing.  It is really well designed with quite simple mechanics integrated into a satisfying whole.  Those mechanics keep the game moving along at a good pace.  Having said that, I suspect that downtime would become an issue with the full five players.

Others have complained that there isn't much fire or fury in this game.  I think it represents the multi-faceted Vikings very well; at different times and places raiders, traders, explorers and settlers.

The four ways to score offer lots of choices and plenty of opportunities to steal points from under the noses of your opponents.  It's early days for me with this game, but there seems to be no single track to victory. 

Asmodee has done a very good job with the production of Fire & Axe.  It all looks very nice indeed.

RATING: 7
Great, interesting and little-seen theme. The sagas drive the game, because they are worth a lot of points. But it may happen that you took a lot of effort to colonize a certain area, but failed to colonize the last space. The player next to you colonize the last space and got the saga. The game contains some silly mechanism to thwart each another and doesn't feel outstanding to me.

The Russian rivers looks like seas which is a pity. This should have been done differently.

Although this game is a bit simplistic, it also has a nice touch with history. And you'll have a game that can be finished in an evening.

Each player takes control of a Viking tribe and tries to accomplish various missions that are available to all players. Missions include trading wares, raiding cities, settling colonies, exploring areas. There is enough variety and things move quickly. Each player also has event cards that can help him or harm his opponents. The theme is really there. The rules are easier than they look. It took us around 2 hours to complete the game and it was a lot of fun.

Fire & Axe is a beautiful game with nice plastic miniatures and easy mechanics, it is easy, while competitive and sometime a bit cut-throat. The game flows smoothly, but there is a lot of luck involved with some way to manage it.

now this is how you produce a game!  the box is a bit oversized, but the components are absolutely excellent.  usably overdone stuff like the town markers were top notch.  you could have a face-down chit for vps, but instead you get a nice plastic castle.  none of the bits seemed superfluous, just nice.  the only glaring omission is a player aid.  as another player mentioned, it does seem odd that the interaction is so long-distance, done with cards from any location and not related to piece proximity.  cards vary greatly in strength, and bad luck can be devastating in certain situations because of the amount of prep and travel it takes to reach certain areas.  while other players' turns aren't devoid of interest, they can be ignored while you run to the bathroom or whatever.  the only thing that matters is how the board looks when it's your turn.  since they take a while, this can result in a bad amount of downtime.  we weren't focusing on sagas nearly enough in our first game, but with 4 players it took over 2 and a half hours.  i think the game is actually playable with 2 though, and i intend to try it that way.  lightly thematic, but very decent fun.  i'm pressed to think of a multiplayer war-type game with a map that i'd rather play.

An excellent Viking trade/area control simulation with some really nice devices, such as the Weather Dial and how it can affect your voyages. Combat and trade are slick and intuitive, but pay very careful attention to the scoring, because you can do gangbusters if you pay attention to the Saga cards, scoring Settled regions, and so forth. This new edition is gorgeous, and I'm glad I finally got a chance to pillage it into my own collection.

5 players, first game, won by a distance but difficult to know why.  Ok, I got 4 Swedish saga (mission) cards, but mainly I think it was because I played solo in a different part of the board to the others.  A little analysis paralysis, well thought out, but just not that exciting.  End game scoring is very heavy and would normally add to uncertainty, except that it is calculable beforehand on the last turns.  (Sold Sep-06)

An interesting pick up and deliver game.
I liked the theme, and the bits were amazing.
Our first game took about 4 hours though, and if it hadn't been for all the player aids from BGG, the first play wouldn't have been possible.  The rules are atrocious, and many of the cards don't use the terminology from the rule book, so there can be a lot of confusion about things during your first couple of games.

The thing I am not really happy about this game is the high level of luck.  I normally don't mind, but it can be a real game breaker in this otherwise sterling game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.7
A first-class game. Production values are up with those of DoW or FFG. Engaging and exciting theme. Resource management, being the key to the game, allows for a variety of different tactics to be employed successfully. Some will baulk at the degree of influence played by dice in this game, but I feel it adds the right amount of uncertainty to back the theme of intrepid Norse traders and the choices that they would have been forced to make with no hard data, but instead reliant on chance events and superstition. Great replay value, also serves as a fine gateway game for non-gamers as it is easily learnt and, at about 2 hours per game, is long enough to feel substantive without outstaying its welcome. If you don't own this game, then either make friends with someone who does or raid your piggy bank. A rare treat to have a game that exceeds your expectations rather than slightly failing them.

Essentially an action point game with great theme integration.

Well, this game is a luckfest! Between dice rolls and card draws, you can't call this game "strategic". Nevertheless, it is FUN! Settlements rebelling thrice in a game, horrendous sea-monsters attacking the poor vikings, hopeless attacks crowned with success, forceful attacks wasted with triple 1s... You must play this game thinking of having fun. And you will have!!!

Before playing, I knew that it was going to be a die rolling game with unbalanced Rune cards, but I was expecting more excitement.  The actual viking pieces looked pretty good, but the settlements did not work for me.  I really didn't feel like I was raiding a settlement when I had to roll a 6-sided die.  Instead I felt more like a construction worker, who transports a building from the board to my playing area.  Rolling dice for the Settling action was slightly better, for you at least get to place a viking figure on the board.  So overall, the die rolling did not work for me in this game.  I guess that I only find rolling dice exciting when you are attacking an opponent.

For some reason, even though I have yet to win this game, I really enjoy it.  I think I'm going to have to become more balanced in my executions.  It's really tempting to try to just take over as much as possible, which, when competing with your opponents, never seems to work out the way you want.  The settling aspect seems to be a powerful way to go.  I guess I'll just have to play it more to find out the best strategies.  Beautiful board and great bits.  I look forward to many games in the months and years ahead.  [Gift]

RATING: 5
Played twice and both times it hasn't excited me. Mostly multiplayer solitaire but eventually the luck factor can feel unbalanced - one failed settlement or raid can decide the game and cause a 60+ point swing.

There is a small screwage element if you get the right rune cards. From experience, it's very frustrating when you repeatedly get hit on whilst failing to draw anything that can get you some revenge.

Also has the common problem that a new player to your right can give a decent advantage.

Nice euro with a Viking theme. It isn't as exciting or combat focused as you might find in an Ameritrash game, but I like the balance trading and settling along with the occasional raiding and plundering.

I really like the flow of this game. You begin by loading up your boat and setting sail to trade goods, then once you have befriended the locals, you pillage the city, then later settle these cities with your own clan. There is some luck with any dice rolling game, but you have many options in the game and can put luck on your side with smart decisions and timely moves.

RATING: 7
This was a great experience. The rule which awards the whole credit for Saga completion to the player who achieves the last step makes for great tension between long term planning and opportunism. The automatic "snap back" to winter quarters at the end of a voyage is an inspired way of avoiding the "trudge back home" problem of many trading game. Every time I have played it the result was in doubt to the very last Saga bonus. One caveat, this needs to be played at pace since analysis paralysis and downtime might be an issue with the wrong group. 
UPDATE:- played the second edition and REALLY dislike some of the new cards which turn the game into a tit-for-tat "take that" slugfest. In fairness they do warn about this in the rules but be warned; if you like your games to be skilful avoid the new cards at all costs.
UPDATE:- The more I think about it the more I am convinced that they got the balance of VPs wrong. Distant voyages to the far north and the Med are no more (or sometimes less) valuable than local trips around the Atlantic. This has a number of deleterious impacts.
1) The power of the settlement stealing cards are increased since all you need do is hang around nothern europe and steal one of the lucrative (12 point) eastern England settlements
2) Long voyages are not very productive and so the game exhibits an inverse tension and speed curve as it slows down towards the end. The leader might be motivated to complete long voyages to close out the Sagas but everyone else is better off catching up on points in shorter runs. As a result close games stagnate as no-one can risk ending the game.

In my opinion making Central Mediteanean and Far North voyages much more lucrative would make for a better paced game that better  rewarded enterprise and explioration.

As others have noted, a pretty cool game is undermined by very "take-that"-y type cards. The dice rolling for the Settling and Raiding is fine, and seems within the character of the game. Playing a card to force an opponent of choice to give you that Settlement they just got, not so much.

Several comparisons ran through my mind as I played this for the first time... It's a bit Britannia. It's a bit pickup-and-delivery (like Bermuda Triangle). It's a bit point-scoring Euro. It's a bit plasticky Amerigame. I love the random missions that the Saga deck offers. And I really like the fateful boons and banes of the Rune deck. The simple mechanics for trading, raiding, and settling keep the game moving at a good clip and the mechanics for movement, wind change, and desired goods change are well-integrated. A lot of little good things. ...So what's wrong? Nothing, really. Production is top-notch and the game is easy to learn and play. The problem is, perhaps, in the titles for the various editions: There are Vikings galore but their impact isn't quite a "fury." There are axes on those Viking pieces, but no "fire" in the game. It's all just a bit... bloodless. 

UPDATE: The heart of the game is in "stealing" (completing) sagas ahead of the others that may be working on them. Then the gloves come off and ruthless Rune card play ensues--often leading to the delay or outright ruin of another player's expedition. Damn you, sea monsters! Recommend: swapping the dice with something more like "knucklebone" dice or "skull dice." Also, transparent red or orange disks (like tiddleywinks) for marking raided areas. "Pirate" coins for the money might make a nice addition as well.

Much of the game revolves around racing to complete shared objectives (mission cards) that also serve as a game timer.  Several players can work on a mission but only the player who completes it collects the card and sometimes VPs.  This leads to a highly competitive atmosphere but ultimately the game is decided by dice luck and card luck (i.e., the Rune cards you can pick up to use to attack other players).  There is considerable variability in the strength of Rune cards so depending on who draws the cards, they could either balance the game or create a runaway leader.  If you like dice games or "take that" games, Fire & Axe could be a fun romp... but I'd rather play something else that is shorter and has a less competitive and intense atmosphere.

RATING: 7
Fun, light Viking themed game, with trading and settling as well as pillaging all on the cards. The Vikings (players) cannot fight each other (as they're all vikings after all) and hence compete in hte burning trading settling, pillaging kind of antics that vikings got up to historically. 

There's a fair bit of luck with the dice rolling aspects for attacking cities and a random number of point to be gained there. Also dice rolling for settling is of course luck based. This is an enjoyable romp of a game, you're not going to take it too seriously.

Trade, Raid, then Settle (in that order). You each have your own Viking ship to do the three things Vikings liked to do. Each of the three activities can earn you points and there are "saga" cards (series of activities) that provide either instant or potential bonus points at the end for completing them. Dice and cards round out the play elements. Dice are involved in Raiding and Settling, while cards are available to either help your cause or hinder others.

Quite thematic and colorful but very random. Plays a little long (2 - 2 1/2 hrs) for the high degree of chance, at least for me. Not to be taken too seriously. I'll play if pressed but I doubt I'll ever own a copy,

RATING: 8
Great game, slightly multi-solo feel, although there is opportunity to mess with your opponents. People complaining it's too long - remove another 3rd era saga (and even another 2nd) to cut playing time considerably. 

Originally owned the Ragnar Brothers version, but some players struggled with the cloth map to work out what was sea and what was land! Upgraded to the Asmodee version (very nice) and traded the Ragnar one.

Like this one - definitely won't trade it away, although others seem less keen, so it doesn't get played as much as I'd like

Have only played "Viking Fury" published by Ragnar Brothers.

It would rate better if there were no dice involved. The map is bland and monochromatic. Very hard to tell land from water.

Update:  7 -> 7.5

Have now replayed as Fire & Axe. It was a lot of raucous fun. Euro/Ameritrash blend. Efficiency action-point game with luck of Saga cards and dice thrown in. 

The new Asmodee edition has great components and is esthetically attractive. A million times better than the butt-fugly Ragnar Brothers edition.

This game was far too long and involved for what it was: a luck-driven questing game where you try to accomplish random objectives by playing random cards and recieving random rewards. Great if the game takes 20 minutes, hellish when it takes 2 hours.

There seems to be a lot of luck and chaos elements in this game but you should be able to win with a good strategy even if you are unlucky.

Playing time is a little to long.

I enjoyed most of the things going on in this game.  The missions were enjoyable, the theme, the map, and the components were all really nice (typos on the cards are forgiven).  With all of that said, I had a few issues:  

1) Downtime.  Lots of downtime.  I don't think it's completely avoidable either, because things can change from turn to turn, and you will base your decision partly on the choices of other players.  

2) Card powers difference.  There is a wide variable range of powers, going from very specific or very limited use to automatically screwing your opponent pretty badly.  There definitely needs to be some work in this area.  

3) Lack of real interaction.  I could screw someone with cards no matter where I was, you didn't even have to be in the same space.. or ocean.  Also, there was no default attacking option against other players, you had to have a card to do it.. no sail-bys, no attacking other settlements.. nothing.  That was a horrible oversight.  If I'm a viking, I want to attack whenever I want, not be bound by cards.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
I've played this a few times now and it's a good, solid game. It lacks, however, in direct player confrontation, which seems a given for a viking game. If you don't mind the lack of direct confrontation, there are still ways to mess up the other players.

I enjoyed all three play through a of this, but I haven't got to play it enough.

RATING: 6
The process of trading, pillaging, and settling was pretty fun, and the goals set forth by the sagas to keep the game moving were great.  However, this was all marred somewhat by the downtime and annoying "take that" card play.  I can't even imagine playing this with the cards that were added to the game in the new print run!  At any rate, solid enough to play once in a while, but too flawed to play all that often.

Light pick-up-and-deliver/set collection game with a Viking theme. Nice minis and I like the rune cards to help player break the rules, but the game plays on a truly awful board.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Played once and do not feel a real urge to pull this off the shelf in the near future. Still, it's good for a few more plays. I don't believe the replayability is too great. Low player interaction, a big dose of dice luck and fairly unexciting play doesn't make this a winner. However, the theme is well done and its quite fun doing epic feats bards will later turn into epic sagas. So, the theme (and its implementation) is probably here the main attraction - less so the cleverness of the mechanisms or such. Doesn't really feel like a recently released game. More reminiscent of the 80s.

Still, I enjoy this a whole lot more than History of the World. 

PS: Like the tablecloth. I've got an ancient Viking game (from a National Trust gift shop) using one as well. Still, the land should have used the brown used elsewhere on the map. That brown would have made it less drab. Perhaps some wargame companies should also go tablecloth rather than thin paper. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.25
Fun and streamlined simulation with easy rules and enough chaos to keep it interesting.  It definitely has a Euro feel although it boasts a solid narrative and has dice rolling and powerful card play that pushes it towards the Ameritrash spectrum.  

It's definitely a unique game but felt similar in philosophy to DRCongo in terms of strong Euro mechanisms tied with random chaos to simulate reality - the other Ragnar brother game I have experience with.

I enjoy this game, and would like to get to play it more.

May well be the best Euro/Ameritrash title I've played in the past year or two.

Comments as to the lack of combat ... I'm not sure I agree.  I have twice seen the winner be the player who pillaged the most (and most successfully) over traders, settlers and explorers.

But I do love having the variety of activities.

Update: Played first game with three players.  I like it quite a bit.  Rating 7.75 for now and will re-evaluate after more plays.

Update: Played next game with five, and it worked really well.  Went over well with the group too.  This one will hit the table more than most in the near future.  Excellent game, on par with Power Grid & Railroad Tycoon in my book.

1 learning game, 5p, 3 1/4 hrs with instruction. There's a lot to the game that seems well done, but ultimately I don't want to play it. First positives: 1) I love the ship-loading mechanism and 2) related days/action points. 3) I like the traversable shapes of the map, its distribution of goals, 4) and the sculpted pieces a lot.............. Neutrals: 1) I don't mind the dice. 2) I don't mind the fact that it's all tactical and opportunistic (mini/maxing action points, some risk taking), but it would be more appealing for me if strategies were available.............. Negatives: 1) A key part of the game is making dogged multi-turn efforts to score target points. But a simple, breezy, time-free play of a opponent's Rune card can undo or even steal your hard-earned accomplishment. 2) Who gets their accomplishments destroyed and stolen? Games with a large "take that" factor (esp. as painful as this) naturally bring up the silent or vocalized question of who "should" and "should not" be the target. 3) Upside-down map annoyance: It's very difficult to read the important saga cards upside down on the center display, not to mention the related region names on the board. I wish boardgame companies made 4-angle (or at least 180/180) information symmetry an imperative -- why should there be visual advantages or disadvantages? 4) It's a long game with 5 players. 5) This is just taste, but I tend not to like point cards in boardgames (also true for me in Amun Re for example).

Fun, clean-playing Viking-themed Euro. There is a bit of direct player interaction, but not so much that you get into a beat-up-the-leader cycle. I think the game does a good job of balancing self-interest with not aiding other players.

It also plays much quicker than I expected. I'm happy to play this one any time.

Area control game with dice. A number of different ways to score points (trading, raid and settling), with multiple scoring bonuses at the end of the game. 

The dice can be unforgiving in this game. Overall you don't get a huge number of turns, and a set of bad rolls can wipe you out of the game and set you back 1 or 2 turns, particularly if you push for a high risk high payoff mission. Unlike other area control games, there isn't the opportunity to launch a direct attack on your opponents, so the leaders aren't easy to pull back. So in that sense this is more euro than war game.

Like many games, a balanced strategy is the way to go, with a mix of trading, settling and raiding(and trying to pick up as many bonuses as possible). 

There is a bit too much dependent on the roll of the dice in this game for me. Still a solid game and would happily play again.

Yes, there are dice, so the dice-phobes should move along without even trying.

In the end, this is a dice fest.  As such, I can only get behind it so far.  But it does have some fun things going for it.  I liked the action points and the route planning.

I really didn't think I would like this game all that much.  I was wrong.  It is not my favorite, by far, but I found myself really enjoying it.
The name is a little deceiving, as there is not a lot of either fire or axe.  The combat system is pretty abstract, and very far removed from visions of nordic conquerors putting towns and villages to torch, ravaging the womenfolk, and plundering treasuries across the European frontier.  There's a lot more trading and settling going on, which, in proper historical context, is probably more accurate anyway.  In fact, the way the game is arranged, it might even find it's way into a classroom as a teaching tool.  The concept of seasonal migrations can be a hard concept to articulate, but the game demonstrates it very well.
Anyway, the bottom line - misleading name aside - I enjoy this game quite a bit.  Although I'm not going to run out and purchase it, I'll never turn down a game.

Excellent game but a tad longish...an 8.

The multiple paths to victory with the sagas, settlements, and trading are well implemented. The dice and some player actions introduce some chaos but not too much.

A strong innovative system. Recommended.

Good but a bit longish game. Very beautiful components.

Update: After some plays it's still good which actually surprised me, I though it would grow old real quick. The main problem with the game is that sometimes you can get a combination of open sagas that are hard to fulfill at that moment which can stall the game.

After 1 play, this is either a 6 or 7 for me.  I liked the theme...the sailing around.  Even the die rolling for raids/settlements was fun.  However, there is little player interaction other than "take that" from some card play.  Also in this one game, it took a looong time to finish.  I think this is more the players than the game though...so I'll assume the game is fine and rate it a 7.  If game length is always this long, I'll have to drop it at least 1 point, possibly 2.

RATING: 9
Players represent their own tribe of Vikings, and spend 250 years of game time trading, raiding and colonizing their way around the Northern Hemisphere.  Players on their turn spend 7 "days", which is a fancy term for actions, fitting out their ship and/or sailing around the rather attractive and abstracted map.  There are ports dotted around the place which allow players to trade (earning small to medium amounts of victory points), raid (earning medium to large points) or settle (potentially earning lots of points).  Raiding and settling require die rolls to determine success and potential losses in the attempt.  Nice touches on ship movement make it difficult to sail in certain directions.  Also, a deck of saga cards (objectives for end of game points) keeps things on a historical tangent, and allows for some player interaction via timing of their actions.  Nice game, feels a bit like a History of the World type Ragnar game - very easy to pick up and play.  It does seem designed to produce tight finishes, and feels a bit vanilla if you play too much of it, but once or twice a year it's a joy.

RATING: 4
I respect this one and want to like it more, yet it doesn't have a lot to offer experienced gamers. 
 
It would be great for folks who like Days of Wonder titles or other involved games. More thematic than History of the World but somehow missing the interaction. I'm a bigger fan of Ragnar Brothers' other releases.

RATING: 7.5
The game comes with a fine artwork depicting on a hard mapboard, in an abstarct way, the East Coast of N.America and Europe as far as the coasts of the Middle East. Rulebook is easy to digest. Mechanics of play might slow you down during the first game turn but once you get the feeling it all goes smoothly. Each player,starting from Scandinavia, will get his Viking tribe, he will equip his longboats with crewmen and load them with goods. During your turn, you will navigate your longboats, attempt trading, raiding,and settling into an area. The play would not be intriguing if it wasn't for the Sagas that one has to complete and gain more points. Based on the action each player has taken, is awarded points respectively. The winner is the Viking who has acquired the most points. Although rules are light, it needs some planning, some luck and the use of rune and sagas cards give a totally different game play every time you start it.

RATING: 8
Good action point system, fair amount of dice rolling, and some nasty card play makes this feel quite a bit different from a Euro, but it still plays (and scores) like a Euro at it's heart.  It's a game that's hated by some folks for that reason, but I still have fun with it and have really enjoyed it.  Superb production values also.  The viking theme fits very well.  Probably best with 4 or 5 players to make the Sagas get completed faster and increase the "poaching" opportunities.

Lots of fun.  Very well thought out.  Good replay value.  Just the right amount of confrontation.  One of my favorites, but takes about 2 hours.  Take my advice and prepare for the endgame.  The one with the most places will win.  The score the cities card is devestating--you might consider playing without it.

 
 Just got the new version --  FIRE AND AXE!!!  Uh...freakin' WOW!!!!!!  Amazing bits.  What an upgrade!  My only wish is that the Prepare and Sail tokens had plastic bits like the towns.  The seem pretty easy to lose.  I might have to find something to use for them.

Végre, sok év után csak előkerült. Sajnos nyelvfüggő -mínusz 1 pont-, s nem kicsit: a rúnakártyákon csak szövegesen a tartalom. /Igaz nekem magyarul van már :-)/. A játék maga jól van kitalálva, és a harc nem igazán egymás ellen szól -bár pont a rúnakártyákkal egymás ellen is lehet piszkálódni-. Jó megoldás, h a harc 2 féle -sajnos mi az első játékban pont ezt rosszul játszottuk, pedig itt a lényeg: fosztogatáskor max 3 támadás, de egyesével, és megállhatsz, letelepedéskor max 3 támadás, de egyszerre, előre eldöntve, h mennyivel támadok: nyilván ennek következményeivel. 
A csata kockás, de nem olyan vészes, okosan rakva, jól egyensúlyozható. (Bár ez pl. az eclipseben még jobban van, de itt is jól működik.) Nyilván ez s a rúnakártyák keverik bele a szerencsét, de ettől még a játék maga jól működik, tetszik: legközelebb is játszani kell vele.

Random cards, random victory points, dice rolls galore, and chaotic player interaction.
Not a game of depth, but there are some good tactical choices to make, and you can improve your
results by good choices and playing the odds vs rate of return for the risk. This is the pinnacle
of Ameritrash. 

So if you go in with that attitude, ergo, your end position may not be reflected by the quality of your
play you can have some fun with the game.
 
Play time is a concern as it can overstay its welcome. Rating could rise from an initial 6 if play time drops.

Super new game by the legendary Ragnar Brothers. Epic in scope with astonishingly short playing time, this game recreates the life of the Vikings in a strangely entertaining way. Many interesting game mechanics (finding the best possible move with limited actions is a lot of fun), the only aspect of the game which might turn off some is the immense power of some rune cards. Our solution is to simply leave away some of the more harmful cards, which is easily done.

RATING: 10
This game is thematically the single best Viking-themed game available.  It neatly ties in the five great themes of Viking civilization:  sagas, navigation, raiding, settling and trading seasoned with just a touch of the mythology.  Combine this with play that is simple in its mechanics and resolves neatly within the allotted time-frame and you have one fine game.  This was not only a hit with me as a history buff, it also sucked in my Danish-derived wife due to her heritage, and my light-hearted and adventurous daughter.  When a game can rope in personalities that diverse, and be requested by all, it has earned its chops.

Alright, if someone came up to me right now and said "Matt, we have to play some long, epic style game right now!" Fire and Axe would be my first choice for 4 or 5 (for what it's worth Dune would be my first choice at 6, second at 5). Fire and Axe has a lot going on for it. Great components, easy rules, and a bizillion ways to score points. Overall the game plays pretty smoothly. One thing that really hampered my overall experience was the power of a few rune cards, specifically the ones that make it so your opponents lose their settlements on a successful role. I guess at best this is a minor complaint and I was pretty pleased with the game overall. 

The random elements could be a little frustrating, but I survived.

Great theming and evocative components to boot for the Asmodee version. There's a fun game in there but I'm quite sure it will not hold up to repeated play.

An expansive, exciting looking game that doesn't quite hit the mark.  I've only played 1.5 times, but it already seems to me that the game will play out in roughly the same way every time.

A classic euro/ameritrash style crossover. Send out ships of vikings and trade goods to raid, settle and trade with the rest of europe. Dice rolling for raids and settlement but also sound strategy needed to garner points for the end of the game. Lots to do in the game and an instant hit with my game group.

On the one hand, I really enjoy it.  On the other, I find it too long for the amount of dice and card randomness.  The tension is there, but one or two turns sunk by poor raid or settlement resolution rolls can suck the tension out of the game rather than enhance it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
One of those odd, hybrid games that walks a fine line between genres and just misses achieving greatness. It's part dice-rolling AT as well as part action point planning euro, and I can easily see it not satisfying either camp adequately. The reputation for downtime is, unfortunately, justified. For me, it's still a game I'll play from time to time and I'll just hope that the dice aren't too cruel. I play very conservatively with the dice here as you can't afford too many failures. Dice mitigation shields activate!

Putting the dice aside for a moment, there are some interesting elements here: which saga to go after, to settle or raid, go for the Bloody Axe reward as the biggest raider, steal a city that somebody else has opened up, play a rune card on an opponent, etc.  And I find the whole thing pretty thematic. The playing pieces are great and add to the experience very well.

All in all, it's a fragile game that can be fun if the saga cards come out somewhat evenly and don't give one player a bunch of easy scores and if you roll well. The contingency of all that, however, keeps the game from coming out more than it does. I can't help but feel that, like La Citta, this game could've been great had it been tweaked a bit to smooth out the rough edges and speed it up.

Yet one more I should have played by now...

Having finally played it I was more than a little unprepared for such a screwage intensive game. It's more of an old school "take that" game than I thought. Regardless it was fun even if I played it badly.

I need to try it again, but next time I'll have a dagger in my boot, a sword in my lap, and an axe slung across my back...then I'll be ready to set sail!

A fantastic game.  Well balanced, and you have to be aware of other players trying to snipe sagas you're working on!  End scoring changes everything which keeps you on your toes.

The cloth map is very appropriate for the theme and feel of the game.

purchased from Steve Z.  Bruno Faidutti says in his Ideal Game Library, "Axe and Fire / Viking Fury is a game I would have liked to design. It’s fun, clever, original, true to its theme, and nevertheless relatively simple." It is also his 2007 "Game of the Year".

Quality components.  Good mechanics.  

Very hard to know where opponents are, point wise.  I was not considered the threat--I had the fewest vikings on the board--only 4. Yet I won by a large margin.  I collected settlements and Saga cards, and traded.

The theme is perfectly woven into this well-paced game.  It almost feels historical in how the Viking sphere of influence expands outwards from Scandinavia into all the reaches of their explorations.  Lots of luck here and maybe a few imbalanced Runes cards, but the mix felt right enough to want to play some more.

Great game of Vikings picking up and delivering stuff.  The Vikings were the forefathers of FedEx.  It has a beautiful production and I really like the map.  It plays fun and has some die rolls to keep you guessing.  It has a unique feel and the theme is really great, not one of the silly abstract Euro Viking games that have come out recently, like Vikings and Eketorp.  I hope to play this game more!  

Note:  I've never played it with the newer 'screwage' cards, I'm not sure if I like a combat element between players.

This game is produced to the highest standards.  A large colourful non-warping board and fantastic components.

Gameplay is by exploration and conquering.  Conflict between players is minimal.  I Found the sea movement calculation a little complicated when crossing sea zones and I'm not fond of games where I have to continually refer to FAQS to clarify odd rules.  That said, this is a solid game but just not for us.

I eventually sold this for a very good price as it was taking up a lot of space and not likely to be played as much as it deserved.  I managed to buy two games with the proceeds!

A Viking themed, pick up and deliver game.  Fantastic Asmodee production values.  The plastic is great and the artwork is vibrant and attractive.  The game felt a bit shallow the first time through, but I had not explained several rules correctly, so it could be my fault.  I think the theme works (better than most Viking games) and the combination of the euro-style optimization of shipping goods and the AT-style dice-based combat works surprisingly well for me.  It is a lighter style game - not too much heavy strategy.

Rating is for the 2nd edition. The Viking theme is conveyed well enough with Ameritrash touches mixed with some Euro ones. Loading ships in order to set sail/voyage, with the aim of pillaging (actually trading is more the focus). Quite enjoyable, even with the high luck factor, as players send their ships venturing all over the map. I enjoy trying to manage the luck factor regarding dice rolls, so although some complain about high luck, it is still manageable. 

The darkness of the 3rd edition map is too much. I'm coming from a graphic designer background, so it's appreciated how they were trying to stylize the board, but too hard on the eyes. 

Update: Ended up purchasing the 2nd edition on EBay for $37- lucky find. I scavenged all the pieces from the 3rd edition (except for the horrid dark mapboard) and put them into the 2nd edition. Then, I THREW AWAY the 3rd edition box & mapboard!!! HA HA HA !!! Away with that filth! But now I have better units for the older edition.

Enjoyable game.  Even in the tea-towel version it clicks to the theme well; I imagine the new Fire & Axe will be even better.  Be warned it does have random elements (as befits a viking raiding game).  For example in my last game I had 3 1-in-6 chances of winning 90 points and going from last to first.  So better than 50-50.  I failed.  Thats viking raiding for you.

It took a little while to get rolling with this one.  The rules aren't great and the board isn't clear. The cards and pieces are very nice and the overall production is impressive, but that board needs some work.  Anyway, there is definitely some chaos and evil cards to throw towards people.  As far as a lighter game where you still have choices to be made, this is a pretty fun one.  It has some nice interaction, and yes, there is a sea monster card and there are dice to be rolled.  Fortune was on my side as many a city was sacked without mercy.

Not owned, one play. Had allot of fun. I looked at a few of the cards before we started and realized that the cards nullified themselves.  One card required another player to discard all cards. Another card caused 2 cards of another player to be discarded.  Then other cards did bad things to the goods selling of other players.  So I ignored the cards and trading and just settled and raided.  I won by a long shot. I'm not sure if the game is broken or its just that the other players were so focused on playing cards against each other that they didn't notice me scooping up all of the city tokens and achievement bonuses.  Second Play - I did the same thing, made two tactical mistakes and won by 8 pts but 3rd & 4th were 50 pts behind 2nd.

Based on only 2 plays.  I like this game a lot.  It allows for a nice mix of strategies (trading vs. raiding vs. completion of Sagas vs. settling).  The only two complaints I have is I'd like to see more direct ways to fight amongst players (attacking settlements, ships, etc, though it would add to game length) and the power level of the cards seemed wide ranging.  Some seemed weak and some seemed incredibly powerful.  All that said, I'm happy to play this game whenever it hits the table and would suggest it to make sure it does.

Finally played and the game deserved the waiting. Good euro with good them, many things to make and the right point of interaction, not very agressive but I can take your settlements :) Highly recommended

Players load up their longships with a combination of vikings and trade goods, then sail around the board trading, raiding, and conquering. When the troops and goods run out, the players return to Scandinavia to load up and do it again. Norway, Sweden, and Denmark each have specific goals represented by Saga cards. These help direct the players' actions, since they provide a reward to the player who is first able to fulfill them. Sometimes you can sneak in ahead of another player, finish off the task he's been working on, and poach the Saga card.

Fire & Axe combines many of the Euro-school design principles with the chaos, direct screwage, dice rolling, and thematic bits of an older-style Anglo/American game. I'm not surprised that it was picked up by a French publisher, because that market seems to reside somewhere between the German and the American publishers, in terms of its preferred gaming style.

I think the game's a lot of fun, but it's definitely not for everyone. Players whose tastes veer strongly toward the "Euro" or the "Ameritrash" stereotypes might be frustrated, because someone got their peanut butter in your chocolate.

A little short on "fury," given that colonization and trading are at least as important as raiding. Like many action point games there is a bit of analysis paralysis, but the forgiving "wintering" rule allows players to go for broke and not suffer too terribly if the dice are unkind.

Many things to like but gosh was this luck dependent (rating after one 5 player game). While the dice rolls are equal for all players, the Rune Cards add chaos and imbalance to the game which is maybe ok for 3 players but with 5 it turns out to be a luckfest. Also you get so many points in the final scoring so it is not really important how you score during the game. Not bad but should be tweaked.

Enjoyable theme, and fun mechanics, also little more back stabbing than a typical Euro without the direct confrontation of American style games.   Viking raiding theme, only helps.  Nice artwork, gorgeous minis, fun play.  Card draws from other players can really throw you, as not all cards are equally valuable. Don't expect to ever tire of this one.

RATING: 7
Not bad... it seems a little too random for something that takes 90 minutes to play and quite a while to explain.  The amount of randomness is acceptable overall, but it's high for a game of this length. I guess my main complaint is that the last couple turns are almost exactly the same as the first few; the game doesn't change much at all from the beginning.

RATING: 7
An excellent Viking themed game of trading, raiding and settling, with multiple ways to score points, lots of strategy and a healthy dose of luck... Randomising the sagas, at the start, by removing 3 from each era, increases the replayability, as does the different ways to score.

6 plays... one of the original Viking Fury (4 plyr) and two others (2x 5plyr and 3x 3plyr) of the recent Fire & Axe edition.

RATING: 3
Nice production in an oversized box in the Asmodée edition, but the game feels like it was designed in 1980 and is ruined by extreme randomness.

Two of the three ways to gain victory points depend on the dice, and failing can often set you back several turns. The cards, however, are even worse, varying wildly in usefulness and including some nasty take-that effects - and that's without the optional cards that are said to provide more "interaction". For example, you may spend a couple of turns in preparation and traveling to establish a settlement (which only scores at the end of the game), but there is a card that allows another player to attack it and replace it with one of his own, for a swing of up to 24 points. Scoring, by the way, is weird and poorly thought out, with some huge bonuses.

The decisions are quite simple and there are some fiddly rules, but this is a game supposed to be carried by the theme. This might work if it were a half-hour affair, but my first game lasted more than two hours beyond that. I admit that I had a bit of fun, but for that length, the amount of randomness is unacceptable, and I'm not willing to repeat the experience any time soon.

RATING: 7
Fun, family-friendly viking game with decent playing time and enough confrontation to keep interest (well, this IS is game about blood-thirsty vikings, right?). I'm not sure that the set-collection part of the game work all that well, but apart from that, nothing seems blatantly broken. There's nothing that really shines here either, though.

if you cant find the Asmodee edition, get the Ragnar bros edition it is available from them still, you can always pimp it out your self.

It's funny, how a game with this simple mechanics can be so thematic and immersive at the same time! It's better than the sum of it's Sagas. It also has very good production values and beatiful moodsetting graphics. I once had the (mis)fortune of playing this with houserules, where every fallen Viking resulted in a shot of single malt. That was a gaming evening to remember to but I'm not sure I really do...

RATING: 8
This is one of the more underrated games on BGG in my opinion, and that is despite it's good rating.  This is the "I took that resource before you" game done right!

There is a lot more interplayer conflict than first appears.  Nearly everything you plan on your turn is based on what the other players do.  There are several strategies to win (although placing settlers seems like a very strong strategy) and there is nearly always something to do.  Every turn you have some gut wrenching decisions about what to do, where to do it, how to get there efficiently, how many men to take, can you do something else this turn too, etc. etc.  For a 90-120 minute game, it goes by fast because the decisions are interesting and change with each player's turn.  I tried the "bloody axe" strategy in our game, but also tried to do some trading and settling as I went.  If I played again, I think I would concentrate more on trading and settlement and view the bloody axe as more of a side mission that you want to do, but not an area you need to dominate.  The different strategies set each other up, and if you try to kill all the cities, all you are doing is setting them up for other people to use.  Lots of interesting dynamics in this one!  The dice add some necessary tension and randomness to the decision making, but at times seem to really drive the action.  I wish you threw more dice, to make individual lucky/unlucky rolls have less effect, or something to make the bell curve a little friendlier.  Risk management should be part of the game, but in our game one fella had really bad luck on several turns and I'm not sure he could have won regardless of how well he played.  The weather compass should have been a random piece, moving it with the cards isn't very thematic.  There is actually a lot of interaction available if you take lots of rune cards.  I think Fire and Axe gives me a lot of the feel and gameplay of age of empires III, but with a game that seems longer, has less interesting decisions, a similar level of theme and less balance.

RATING: 10
Fire and axe: A Viking Saga ("Invasion" on my french edition box) was an excellent surprise. I was afraid of the random factor, of long rules, of pasted on theme and game length; none of these fears proved to be justified, and this game is one of my favorites.

Components are very good (Asmodee version); I like the miniatures, and especially the little cities under which the secret values are plugged in. I like the treasure piles too, they add a nice touch. The map is just beautiful and does much to create the atmosphere. The covert art is really inspiring. I would have liked a player aid, but this is really a minor quibble, and the price is excellent for that kind of quality stuff.

Strategically, you can choose to concentrate on pillaging and/or colinisation or commerce, or a mix of the two. Objectives ("Sagas") are also important, and whatever you do, you will have to pay close attention to what other jarls are doing; preventing them to complete sets of colonies or to accomplish too many sagas is essential to be a successful viking. This is were most of the interaction between players take place; card play is more direct but less crucial.
The navigation and wind rules are simple but fit in perfectly.

Cards add a little chaos and much chrome, while dice add a little risk. The number of dice rolls is sufficient to average things if you engage in serious bloodshed, and luck plays a real, although managable role. I just cannot figure how some reviewers wrote that this game is too luck dependant. I think that the presence of luck is justified in the game, and is less important than in games I played recently like Battlelore or even Yspahan... and certainly much less than in Heroscape.
I do prefer games with less luck, that is why my score is not a 10.
Raiding IS risky, but the odds are quickly determined; you do not need a math major to see that Rome won't fall easily, do you?

People hoping for a game with one eyed gods, sea monsters or even Tony Curtis vs Kirk Douglas may be surprised; Vikings were also farmers and that part of viking life would be lacking from the game if it were to be a simulation of a jarl's life, but I think the game depicts quite realistically what were the viking raids.
Some people will regret not having more blood and church burning; the game is closer to a pick-up and deliver game than to a wargame, but the theme is very present.

I can recount the ill-fated Roman expedition of a friend or my own travels to the far north of my very first session; this is a game which let you create stories to be retold.
I think that "Fire and Axe" is a good example of mixing different "schools" of gaming: it has the streamlined rules of an euro game with an excellent and well exploited theme, just the good amount of luck and the components are top notch. The game clocks just under two hours and has an excellent fun-to-time ratio.

I am eager to play again, I wish there were more games like this.
edit:
even though I feel the luck is very present, this has become a game that I really always want to play.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
The Asmodée edition has very nice bits and a good looking board.  Somehow, the "Fury" must have been lost in translation as combat is minimal.  Even though I suck at die rolling, I prefer more combat than what is offered here (which is mostly Trade and Settlements).

Being able to do 7 actions all at once is good, but while the other players are taking their turn there is very little for you to do.  With the downtime, I was able to plan my next turn while my opponents were doing theirs, then still had time to kill, therefore making this game a tad boring for me.

Comment based on one play. I bought this game in the blind, based solely on the comments and market demand for this OOP game, paying a pretty penny for a NIB copy. I wished I had tried this before buying, but copies are extremely rare that I had only seen it once at a game day long ago.

The exploration mechanic is always intriguing to me, and the Viking theme was appealing. However, I was disappointed with how VPs were doled out for completing sagas. It just didn't make any sense to me that the last player to complete the saga, which comes in three parts, would get all the VP. Thus, the game boiled down to maneuvering to squat on a twice-conquered space, just to ensure some neighboring player wouldn't be able to sneak in for third conquest. Meanwhile, the uncontested player wandering off by themselves would rack up a number of points. The board is large enough that there is not enough checks in place to keep a loner, in a 3-player game, from scoring big. Also, the conquest mechanism was based on a simple die roll against some number. This is similar to combat in Prophecy or Talisman, which I find less than satisfying. The 3-player game clocked in at 3.5 hours, which is way too long for a game with a only a short set of meaningful decisions. I will have to sit with this awhile, and try to play it with more than 3 players. For now, it is a '6'.

My first Ragnar Brothers game! A deceptively simple 'family' game that isn't difficult to teach but looks great and really feels thematic. We always play with the 'do your opponents over' cards to get that true Viking feel. Trading and settling is fine but every now and again it's good to invoke the Norse Gods with a bit of rivalry! I do think it goes on a bit to long. To fix this we take out a couple of the saga cards from each age.

This would make my top-10 list of "games where the theme really works." Yet, somewhat surprisingly, this is a game of raiding and pillaging in which you never attack other players, you just sort of swoop in and steal good spots from one another. There's a bit of an optimization exercise going on underneath all the chrome, but the chrome is *fantastic.*

Outstanding.  Although this is a fairly straightforward pick up and delivery game, the historical theme is handled intelligently and elegantly. I don't have a sense yet for whether the various strategies are balanced, but they give the sense of multiple viable paths to victory.  The cards push the action without driving it, and the dice luck factor feels just right.

This edition/version (Asmodee) OOP.

I love this game.  Wonderful integration of theme and mechanics.  Great mix of euro-style strategy w/more FFG-style combat and components.  I have to play this again!  Did I mention I love the theme? ;-)

Some parts of the game I particularly dig:
-The "story arc" - as the game progresses, the sagas get farther away (as far as North America!) and/or progress from a lot of trading to raiding to finally a lot of settling.
-The tension in the decisions.  Just one example - you can trade with a port and earn some $$$, but it softens the port up for someone else to come along and raid/settle it more easily.

I've read comments about one person starting a saga and how easy it is for someone else to finish it, thereby "stealing" it.  It's not as easy as it sounds though.  You have to take a gamble on whether someone will succeed or fail at their saga quest, so you have to commit to loading up a certain way and leaving from a certain home port.  If they turn out to win their saga, you're in a bad spot - you've got to be flexible and find something new to do b/c you've already started your journey.  That tactical flexibility required in mid-journey is not only fun to try to do but very thematic.

Sail around the board where you can trade, settle, or conquer the outposts. There is some luck in trying to conquer which requires die rolls versus the city strength. Also event cards can be played to mess with your neighbor. It has nice pieces and offers some nautical fun.

RATING: 8
I play this with the highly interactive cards removed.

The game has a lot of die rolling, and if you roll high throughout the entire game you will be better off for it. This is the Ameritrash portion of the game, and it sucks! There is some element of risk management, but even when you try to stack things in your favour you can still fail due to a shitty roll. So, everything I enjoy about this game comes with the caveat that for some reason I am willing and able to quietly accept this aspect of the game even though I normally wouldn't like the game for this reason. It's also worth noting that this doesn't tend to hit the table during regular game night, it's usually pulled out during more casual nights with people who probably don't want to wrap their head around the new Euro-hotness.

The game is very thematic and looks gorgeous. Component wise everything is top-notch. There are tons of interesting decisions in this game. You have to carefully plan turns and assess various scoring opportunities. You need to be efficient and keep a close eye on what your opponents are doing as their actions can impact you greatly. However, some people may get bogged down in analysis. If this happens it can be boring for the other players as there is nothing to do or think about on other player's turns.

It's an unusual combination of Euro and American gaming. However it's more of a Euro-game for fans of Ameritrash than the other way around. I'm definitely a Euro-gamer, but for some reason the theme and game play in Fire and Axe really appeal to me. I've been playing it for 5 years and I continue to love it despite its flaws.

RATING: 6
Fire and Axe feels more 'Euro' than I expected while still featuring a lot of randomness and a noticeable take-that factor from the rune cards which allow to target other players which otherwise is not possible in the game. Basically, it takes the action point model best-known from Tikal and crosses it with Serenissima-like boats on a mission. As usual with action points, many options are created while at the same time AP sets in with prone players. In a thematic game about viking raids it feels odd as you expect much more raucous gameplay. I could see me playing this occasionally but only with pre-selected players not AP-affine. Our first game would have taken close to 4 hours if we didn't had to call it.

I would imagine that the theme and the pieces are important for many people.  I think they are adequate, but these types of themes are not necessarily my first choice in games.  That said, the game is fun to play, on the condition that the play time is manageable.  Under 90 minutes (60 would be ideal) and the game is a fun romp, but any overanalysis that pushes the game past two hours makes a game this random a little too much to endure.

RATING: 6.5
Not bad.  There's a few rough spots.  The game has a lot of AP potential and there's a little bit too much luck for me.  

That being said, the luck isn't a huge factor and I can only rarely see it as being totally destructive.  The game I played I lost because of a few crucial mistakes I made.  (One in particular). 

The scarcity of certain resources makes it a much more confrontational game than I had thought it would be, at least with four.  I also in retrospect don't understand how much trading is really a good idea, aside from completing sagas and if you're positive no one else will swoop in and take those settlements later.

Second edition has great production values and game itself plays its theme pretty neatly.

Wow. This game is ugly. Ugly like a hairy Swedish butt.   I played this once, and as usual failed to pick up on what my priorities should be from the first reading of the rules, and did not have time to correct my strategy before the game was over. I went for the short-term advantage of trade from the beginning and got an early lead, failing to recognize that there might have been a reason why everyone else was settling like crazy. I sat on my hoard of points, managed to win barely any Sagas, and got creamed in the end, placing 4th of 5. It's a fun economic game, and while the mechanics don't differentiate it THAT much from other stock, racing, and balancing games, I might enjoy it more on a second try. I can't identify anything I'd fix, except that there's barely any interaction with other players. There's a little incentive to cooperate - you get a bonus if everyone settles the same region - but no real head-to-head trading contests or anything. If I were redesigning the game, I'd throw in a little more negotiation or trading or something. As is, everyone just plays the game alone together.

Funny, but very luck dependent game. The saga cards are very comparable to those "major lines" in Railroad Tycoon: When they come up, most probably someone will have the luck to score them without having to invest much. Same for attacking the cities: Very often you see someone with only two raiders attacking a big city like rome and winnig while the dice luck prevents the other guy from taking a small one like the Baleares with five raiders. It's a pity that game is so much luck dependent.

I played this twice today and I just loved it! The integration of the trading, raiding, and settling mechanics, and how they can progressively earn more points opens up a few potential valid strategies, and the cards and dice throw some chaos into the equation -- just enough to make it more thematically "Viking-ish". Lavish production values and careful attention to balancing the points (though at first unintuitive, the varied scoring does balance out) really show us how much the designers and producers cared about this one.

And above all else, this game is FUN!

UPDATE: Raised rating to an 8.  Such great fun times playing this game.  Last game I tried raiding Paris.  I had softened it up by trading with it, but had only one Viking left.  Good thing I had a "Berzerk Fury" card, right? It gave me a +2 bonus to attack the fabled French city.  Now I just needed a 3 or better!  I squared up and rolled... a 1.  My last crewman lost, my boat sank to the bottom of the Atlantic and I lost the game.  I STILL HAD FUN!!

RATING: N/A
In Fire & Axe: A Viking Saga, originally released as Viking Fury, you vie for glory across three epic Viking sagas, each one a different journey to raid, trade, and settle territories. Will you choose the path of diplomacy and trade for victory? Or will your longship cast a bloody wake?

Start your journey by gathering crew and goods to outfit your boat. Will your ships be filled with warrior or goods? Settlers or sackers? After your launch from bustling ports into the open sea, you must choose your path to power — but don't get lost in the wind; the sea will gladly devour souls who take her lightly...

I own the 1st edition which I bought directly from Ragnar Brothers. It's clearly a labour of love from them - and curiously - together with Hnefatafl, both are the only in my collection which feature a textile playing area. Apart from that the game plays nicely and there's a lot of decision making each turn. Definitely it is an underdog that should be paid more attention to.

It feels like solitaire but I think it's a very interesting action points system type of game, combining travel and resource mgt. aspects.  There are at least 3 levels or ways to score victory pts plus each level has a way to score group combinations and endgame bonuses.  Lots of choices, a bit of interaction betw. plyrs with the rune cards adding wrinkles and variety to the game.  Even with the randomness of dice and cards, VF seems very balanced without one dominant path towards victory.   You'll probably need to score VPs in several various levels to win so don't just focus on a single path to monopolize VPs.  Cloth map could've be better produced but it's really a fun thinking game with a slight bit of downtime.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not a bad blend of Eurogame and Ameritrash involving some conflict as you still try to acquire sets in a thematic matter.  The cards definitely give some fun and randomizing flavor to the game and the compass mechanic which moves around giving differing amounts of allowable movement in an ocean before sacrificing a guy or two is a nice twist.

After my first play I found the game experience to be only meh.  The components are top tier and the theme is spot on but the mechanics themselves seem to be a bit cumbersome.

I would play again though as I now know what I am doing.

A superb game. Though some may say "point salad", to me I'd say the game gives you several paths to gain VP; such as: sacking cities, building settlements, trading goods, completing quests, etc. The fun is that you must carefully plan out your voyage by selecting what to put on your boat for your mission, account for the danger of the sea, and possibly most importantly, pay attention to the impact other players have on the game state. Dice play a large roll in this game, (with many rolls of 50/50 or 60/40 to succeed), but I feel that adds charm and simulates the randomness of invasions and war. With all those aspects going on in the game it also remains surprisingly simple and easy to grasp.

Fire and Axe is a phenomenal game! An instant classic! 

Pros:
+strikes a nice balance between luck and strategy (I don't mind the dice rolls)
+thematic
+the board is gorgeous 
+the components are fantastic 
+the gameplay is smooth and clean 
+it feels like an epic game
+Wife loves it :)

Cons: 
-Play time is longer than 90 minutes 
-Scalability could be better

Overall, it's just a lovely game! What's more is that I don't really have anything else like it in my collection. Merchants and Marauders would probably come closest, but Merchants is WAY more rules heavy and longer. The crazy thing is that I've only played with 2 and the game played really well. If I never played with more, I'd be okay. All you need to do is limit the saga offering area to 2 cards instead of 3 and remove 1-2 extra cards from each saga deck. That's it. Awesome!

Update 8/30/15:

This is definitely better with 3. I still really enjoy it with 2, but with a capable third player, it takes the game to the next level. Still loving it.

It's also a game where you can think you're not doing that well but at the end when all the points are added up, it can be a surprise.

RATING: 8
This is a really fun game as it is, but I wish it were possible for the viking groups to fight with each other. With the rules as written direct conflict wouldn't work so well because settlements are worth so many points; the right move would ALWAYS be to attack another player rather than a neutral space. Might be possible to tweak the rules though.

RATING: 7
Plays best with two despite the game stating that it requires at least three players. Too many players causes it to drag as it can induce analysis paralysis. If playing with 4 or more for Odin's sake don't allow players to advise each other.

Luck comes into this rather more than our group would like and if you are on the wrong end of this then this is a very frustrating game. However, the general concensus is that it is an enjoyable game.

This was a fun Viking Euro. I think I'd enjoy it more if everyone was more aggressively going for the saga cards. Need to play some more and see how it settles in.

RATING: 7
A good game, great production quality in the Asmodee edition.  A similar type of 'voyage and reset' arrangement as in Frances Drake.  Timing and planning can be very important, but also necessary to build in flexibility to be able to respond when an opponent grabs exactly what you were after. Dice rolls can be decisive.  An area capture game with areas not able to be re-contested, which essentially makes it a a race to accumulate the best point opportunities the quickest (whether they be trading, raiding or settling).

Seems that settling is a very powerful strategy with the points multipliers. But if all players know this, then it may be less powerful overall.

Keen to play again and will be interesting to see how it goes after more plays.  A solid 7 to start, may go higher.

This is an ok game.  It has very pretty bits, I love the ships and vikings.  I'm not sure about the 5 player game.  I think it makes the saga cards too random because too many people get to take actions to let you start a saga and finish it the next turn.  Three players would probably go much more smoothly.

Based on two player game. It was really fun trading, settling and not to forget plundering throughout ancient Europe. Especially those nice little twists like trading first with a harbor (to gain their trust), and the turn after that raiding the town. And another turn later building a settlement on the ruins...
We didn't even notice the three hours passing by as we played. 
Highly recommended.

Own Fire and Axe.  

This is one of the best designs I have played in a long, long time.

I felt like a Viking, with the trading, raiding, and settling.

The different ways to score victory points offer a lot of different strategies, however, concentrating on settling is perhaps the most lucrative.

I love the fact that one Viking group can trade a goods token to a port softening up the locals, and then another Viking group can sweep in and take the city much easier.

Sure it is a race game at heart and the gist is pretty basic, but this game is full of flavour and I am glad I purchased it. 

Definitely look forward to playing this again.

06/30/07 Played a three player game of the new Asmodee version. I liked it, though we didn't have very much competition with only three players. And since the game system has minimal player interaction anyway, there was a tendency for us to just "do our own thing" a good deal of the time. I was surprised it took three hours with only three players, considering I don't think we did much analysis paralysis. Even so, I look forward to playing it again. 10/09/07 Played a four player game, which took 3.5 hours. I enjoyed the competition the fourth player added. Though the added time required was an issue. I'm not sure I'd want to sit through a five player game. 12/22/07 Played another three player game. This one only took 2.1 hours, as the Saga cards seemed to fly off the board. 02/23/08 Ditto. 05/17/08 A three player game, 2.5 hours. 12/30/08 Attempted a five player game, but only got 2/3 of the way through it after 2.3 hours. 07/04/09 another three-player game. 08/10/10 Another three-player game. 03/24/12 Ditto. Only took 1.9 hours.  05/06/17 Game #10:  a four-player game in 3.6 hours.

This was actually better than I expected. And to boot the game wonderfully flows better as the game goes further. The only serious rant I have is that I would have like to have a bit more Rune cards which help you rather than hose an opponent. Sagas are mixed bag. A great idea but their existence makes game drag at times. UPDATE 17.12.2007: Upgraded to '9'. This is just fine game and extremely fun. Update: 14.9.2008: Still fun but the actual game is no more that convincing: 7 it is.

You'd never know that Vikings were warriors on the strength of this game. It should be renamed "Viking : Quartermasters & Colonists". Which, if that's your cup of tea, then it's probably a great game for you. However, that's not for me & so the game is largely just an exercise in wandering about the map delivering goods & if you're behind, taking the option of taking a chance & throwing some dice in a bid to catch up.

As a friend called it, "Icelandic Ferry".

For those looking for a gaming experience of an endless orgy of Viking violence rather than the activity that this game is, look elsewhere. 

Beautiful map though.

Despite the coffee stain that flooded the map before the first turn was played... I like the game.  We thought there was a lot of space with 3 players, and it might be quite a bit more challenging with 5.  We thought the cards were of appropriate strength, and I liked the movement.  Love the look of the original game.  No silly plastic!

Played again after several years and it has held up well.  Some nice decisions to make, a bit of a story curve and in our game everyone had a different path and the victory (mine!) was decided by six points, so it was quite exciting!

I first played this in the original tea towel version and commented that the game was great and that deserved a nicer treatment.   Voila!  A couple years later Asmodee answered my prayer.  I bought Fire & Axe and like it even better than the lackluster original.  Great job, Asmodee!

RATING: 7.5
An excellent ameri-euro (dice rolling & action points) with multiple scoring options and a fantastic theme.  You can score through completing a goal (Saga), settling, trading merchanandise or looting treasure.  I like how the ships only carry so much (like the Goldland backpacks) and how the wind effects how far you can safely sail in each region.  However, if you're looking for the "Fury" there's little here.  In fact there's little interaction except in trying to complete something before somebody else does OR using a Rune card to mess with somebody's plans.  Looking foward to playing this again but since it's fairly solitairish I do worry about its replayability.

Really solid mix of clean Euro-style pick-up-and-deliver and completing objectives, and thematic conquest.

Lots of "take that" and some boring cards.

RATING: 5
Rating is a 5 after first play pending future experiences.

My beefs:

1) In a five player game, far too much downtime between turns. As in I was sitting waiting for at least 10 minutes between turns without being involved in the action in any way, and given that each player's turn directly affected the action on the board, there was no way for me to plan out and predict my actions on my turn either (since the game state would have changed too much between other player's turns) necessitating me to take too long on my turn too. This, more than anything, is this game's flaw.

2) It's basically another stupid euro - too little if any player interaction. I mean, c'mon, a viking game where I can't directly attack the other players!?

3) I assumed after an unlucky first turn that I was going to lose and just decided to play the rest of the game settling out all my vikings... and it turns out I won. So the fact that I can win after basically ignoring the entire game means that it's broken.

Still - we were five new players. A three player game of this with experienced players who are actively shutting down each other might be more balanced and intense.

So it's a 5 pending future plays.

RATING: 8
Being (mostly) a eurogamer, I was pleasantly surprised by this game. 

On paper, it sounds like the kind of game where I would tune out on the 3rd round and spend the rest of the game being bored and waiting for it to end.

In practice, I find it tremendously fun. Despite all the dice-rolling and take-that, I find that the game leaves you just enough of a sense of control that wins actually feel like wins and losses make you question what you did wrong, rather than feeling like you just watched the game play itself, or that you only lost because you displeased the dice gods.

Given that sense of control, the game actually feels like an adventure. Every time you come out of the wintering box with a plan in mind, not knowing what the other players are going to do, or how the dice are going to roll, it feels tense and fun.

I also love the way the rivers on the map are ridiculously distorted and look like inland seas. Whether or not that's even close to how an actual Viking would have seen the world, I don't care. Either way, it's a nice little bit of theme that really helps sell you on the feeling of adventure.

However, having owned both the Asmodee and IDW versions of the game, I really must agree with those who say the IDW map is absolutely atrocious. That faux wood paneling look all over the map is a total fail. I think the intent was to evoke images of Viking ships, or a Viking longhouse, or something like that. Instead, it reminds me more of a cheesy 70s van conversion, or some junky homemade furniture you might find in your grandpa's workshop. Not to mention, it completely washes out all the contrast, taking what was a beautiful map that popped with color (tastefully subdued colors, not garish bright colors) and contrast, and turning into some drab, musty thing you'd expect to find in an attic somewhere.

RATING: 6
After reading the rules, this sounded like multi-player solitaire with each viking doing his own thing attacking and trading at ports around the board. Then once you start playing the game, the Runes cards come into play and the sparks start to fly. Many of the Runes cards allow you to negatively impact other players which creates the desire for revenge and pretty soon the "take that" aspect really kicks in. I don't mind the "take that" nature of the game but it caught me a bit off guard. Some players in our game did not like that at all. The die rolling introduces a heavy dose of luck. The components are top notch.  Some things are bit strange such as the magic teleport back to the Wintering Box and the huge bodies of water in eastern Europe that you would never find on a world map. Our game with all first time players lasted about 2 1/2 hours. There was a lot of trial and error going on so we didn't work our way through the Saga cards very efficiently.

Good interaction between game play and theme.  At first glance, the rules look clunky and akward, which leads one to think the game may play in a similar vein.  However, after a couple of passes thru the rules, it all makes sense and the game play is nothing short of fun.  This movement (bad weather) mechanism is novel and adds alot to your planning (which you need to do quite a bit, if you want to succeed in this game).

This game feels like it's at least 30 years old in how it plays. Don't get me wrong, I think the action allowance track is interesting, but the rest of the game feels like a very substandard Euro.

I was excited when I first bought this game, but had lost a lot of that excitement by the time I got to play it and was concerned it would fall flat.  I was happily surprised finally playing.  The game is pretty straight forward though you may not think so looking at the rulebook.  The action point system works well and the ability to alter the wind over time adds some variability.  The Viking theme is not the strongest, but the presentation is good.

Players take on the role of Vikings. Each person has a boat that can hold five Vikings and/or goods. With 7 actions available per turn, one can 1) moving a sea space 2)loading a Viking/good 3) draw a card, 4) raid a town, 5) settle a town or 6) trade with a town. Towns are usually grouped into threes, and if all towns of one grouping are settled, each town value is multiplied by 3. Every turn, there are 3 face up cards, called Sagas. If you fulfill the conditions of the cards, you earn the Saga. For instance, a Saga could be to settle 3 towns south of Denmark, but if the other two have been settled by opponents, and you settle the third one, that card goes to you! Sagas belong to Denmark, Norway or Sweden. Whoever has the most Sagas of one country gets 10 pts per card, second place gets 5 pts per card, and if a tie for first, everyone earns the 10 pts. 

There is a lot of luck with the dice rolling, there is the luck factor of the cards, and who gets targeted by the cards, but it is fun. Plot your strategy and enjoy the ride.

Won my first game, against inveterate gamers who had played it before, rather handsomely. This is probably indicative of something.

There seems to be a right balance between luck and control. There is lots of dice rolling and powerful action cards. I usually don't like too much of these powercard-games but here cards didn't seem to dominate too much. At least if you take out one or two the most powerful cards. Multiple ways to gather points but something in gathering saga cards and relatively big points from majorities of them bothered me. I think my biggest problem is in getting saga cards that is if someone starts to compete with you for one it's in both players preference not to start completing it as only the one doing the last bit will get it.

An original minimaxing game with just the right amount of chaos thrown in, making the game more fun and less AP prone. Absolutely gorgeous components.

With five players, the game felt a little bit too long. Also, for the last three (give or take one) rounds there was very little of any importance to do, so the final rounds were kind of a letdown. With three players, the game runs much more smoothly, and there are meaningful decisions until the very end.

A good game on several accounts. The theme to gameplay fit is tight; it does feel like you are exploring and pushing out the reach of the Viking "empire".  

While I can live with the dice-rolling element, the Rune Cards confer powers which range from suprisingly weak to far too powerful.  This means that if you draw with bad luck, you'll get blasted repeatedly by your opponents who have been luckier in their draws.   

The Rune cards have too much "take that!" power, and this ruins what would otherwise be a very solid game.  Here's an example from my recent play:  

"Why do you get to steal that settlement I worked so hard to create?" 

"Because I have drawn a card that says I can."

"And how do I take it back from you?"

"You have to get lucky and draw this same card and use it on me."

Very pretty and the game works well (by which I mean the mechanics fit together and even though there is plenty of room for fiddliness, it isn't overly apparent), but the fatal flaw is the die rolling.  Too much, and far too influential on the end result.

It's a fun ride for the first hour, but rapidly loses its luster after that.  I would play again, but only with experienced players who can keep the game moving along.  Take too long between turns and the game doesn't offer up enough to keep one's interest.

I think this game is too long for a game with so much randomness. You don't fight each other so it's not really a Waro, though it feels like a Waro/AT game thematically.

Fun game that has the Viking-like players (my regular game group looks like Vikings) draw from Saga and Rune card decks.  Also have Viking Fury and the cloth map is to be had.  The longships and wooden crew members give it a cool feel.  Best with 4-5 players.

The game's point system forces you to go out and settle and raid as the Viking's did historically. But each raid and settle attempt is just a dice roll, and there are lots of dice attempts in the game. There's not much personal conflict - an occasional race to get somewhere first, an occasional attempt to raid someone else's settlement. You go back to base and get stuff, you sail to a destination, you roll dice and succeed and fail. Go back to base, repeat. The game is fine if this is what you're after (and I'm looking forward to playing again).

We rented this game and it was decent.  It wasn't exceptional but we had fun the 3 times we played it.  I don't think I'll buy it but I wouldn't turn down an offer to play either.  Also, we had 3 players but I think it would've been more fun with 4 or 5.

Great looking game! Fantastic theme! Travelling around Europe, trading, raiding and settling, using gorgeous components on a gorgeous board! It's a nice change to the usual mental challenging games I'm more inclined to. This one is very luck driven, but it's ok since it makes the game fun and unpredictable. Great addition! It's better than Valhalla on thematic level and gorgeousness; but I still prefer Valhalla as a game and for the challenge it provides.

RATING: 7
Un gioco - molto ben calato nell'ambientazione - dove c'è tanto fumo (la grafica eccellente, sia nel tabellone che nei componenti) e tanto arrosto (regole e sistema di gioco molto sopra la media). Il sistema di gioco ha alcune grandi idee: il turno nel quale decidi quanto muoverti, quanto equipaggiare la nave o se colonizzare / attaccare e il movimento marino (coi suoi diversi gradi di difficoltà a seconda della zona, ben reso in termini di penalità). A questo si aggiungono molte finezze, come la possibilità di controllare i venti, quella di aumentare il guadagno con un tipo di prodotto e quella di arrotondare punti vittoria con le saghe. Il calcolo dei punti vittoria (carina la classifica dei "committenti", danesi, norvegesi, ecc.), coi suoi moltiplicatori, consente sorpassi in classifica anche all'ultimo turno.
Unico neo: mi sembra di capire che l'unico modo per scalzare i vichinghi colonizzatori da una città controllata sia possibile solo con una carta speciale per cui, una volta stabilito in una città, quella sarà tua praticamente fino alla fine.

Fun game with beautiful components. A bit long though, but it never gets boring. Guess it will go faster once one's familiar with the game. Fair amount of luck/randomness, but somehow it doesn't detract from the experience. The action cards more or less determines to what extent you can be directly confrontational, but as they are easily acquired it's ok.

I was initially concerned after reading the rulebook that there would not be enough interaction in this game, but upon playing, my concerns quickly disappeared. Between the rune cards, blocking other players movements, and 'stealing' sagas from opponents, there is a ton of screwage in this game. Overall, an excellent game with a fantastic theme and beautiful components. It plays quickly and does not wear out its welcome. Highly recommended.

RATING: 8
A longish game that evokes the viking theme well. This is very much a risk management game and luck does play a roll. The other vikings irritate me when when they swoop in and steal your hard earned rewards, but that is what vikings do. A fun game, but the end scoring is kind of a turn off.

RATING: 8
Cool euro with a Viking theme where Vikings are builders more than actual raiders(the raiding actions do not feel very "Viking-like").
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Yet another fantastic game from the Ragnar brothers. Yes, the dice rolling can be swingy but who cares when a game is this much fun?!? In fact, awful or flukey rolls are a key part of what makes this such fun. Does that mean luck can defeat skill on occasion? Maybe. But it would take a really improbable degree of luck either way to prevent a player with clearly superior strategy and tactics from defeating an inferior opponent. The game mechanics are simple yet allow for great variety and pretty deep decision making at times. And it all feels super thematic, whether you're trading, raiding or settling. There are more than a few Viking themed games out there, and many of them are very good, but this has to be my favourite. Oh, and despite not officially catering to two players, we've found that it plays brilliantly with two if each plays two factions.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
At the moment I'm going through a strong game mechancics with theme kick. This game is good in that regard as you use action points to load up and sail for days to either raid, trade or settle. However I'm not a fan of the convulted 7 action points turn, which can involve text reading of drawn rune cards. 

My main gripe is with the scoring, for although there is here and now tracking and also an hidden status which I like, the real issue is the huge point swings and going through each settled area and multiplying.

Now played the beautifullly produced Asmodee version (German release) but I miss the scoring track (and I think the catch-up rule of reduced Cargo hold). The second playing also highlighted the uneasy feeling of the take-that nature of the rune cards (despite being Vikingesque), so coupled with the ever tense and fun die rolling involved your planning can be undermined so treat the game as an experience.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
-

Dice rolling, random "action cards", and chaos reduce this to a game of practically pure luck.   You roll dice for every thing you need to do. Skill means little in this game. You can get severely beaten down out of the blue with "action" cards used on you by another player through no fault of your own or any mistakes in your play. There is absolutely nothing you can do to protect yourself against that.  Ironically, the player who uses a harmful card on you, often times does it not because he strategically chose to set you back (such as if you were leading in points) but simply because you are the only one at the time to whom the card could be applied.

This means the most important element of the game - decision making- has been taken away from the player for the most part. The lack or erosion of players' decision making ability permeates through out the game. Which Saga card to go for, which city to travel to, whether to raid, trade, or settle, etc, most decisions are often either fairly obvious, or very uninteresting.  I doubt if I play this again.

This is one fun game with the right crowd. You need people that will get riled up and trash talk. Makes the game a lot of fun. Great artwork on the new version. Good mechanics. Has a substantial luck factor with the drawing of the cards, card effects and dice rolling so if you don't like luck this may not be your cup of tea. However, I found that the luck evened out over the course of the game. We had a great time this last session.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
1 play - 90 minuts (5 player).

Interesting set of mechanics and options which should have resulted in a more pleasant experience. However, the two options that are dice rolling dependent (sacking and settling) make for a lot of dead vikings. In fact, this competes with Parthenon: Rise of the Aegeon for sending the most men to the bottom of the sea. Initiating an expedition to sack or settle an island ending in dead vikings and back at the winter waiting grounds makes for a boring themeless experience. More viking infuriating than viking fury (or perhaps viking funeral). While I magically came back from last place in the scoring during the final tally, it didn't really seem worth it. I'll play this one more time to see if, given more forgiving dice rolls, this could actually be an enjoyable experience.

I played this once. It was a different kind of game for me, with no direct conflict between players. There was only one flaw that I saw with the game and that was that you could spend the "rune cards" unlimitedly in a turn. Most games will limit special power cards, not this one. Although you can only have 3 in your hand at once, you can draw more and play them.

A great game all around. You have to watch what you do every time, as any slight miscalculation can lose the game for you. You definately have to maximize your boat's potential and your use of days. Don't find yourself as bait for sea serpants and storms to only lose the next turn going home to winter.

I really enjoy this game and look forward to more plays, and will possibly get it for myself. It all depends on how many of my buddies also get it.

The artwork and pieces are wonderful and of good craftsmanship. The ships and vikings call to be painted for even more effect.

It's hard to believe this came from the same company as Mission: Red Planet. I guess they learned from their mistakes.

This was my first token AT game, bought on the cheap and playable at under two hours - although that seems to go out the window with 3-4 players who aim to compete for rune cards rather than random raiding and settling. 

After four games, I'm enjoying it. It doesn't work particularly well with 3-4 players. It is much more fun with 5. The dice can kill in this, particularly as it takes quite a bit of effort and calculation to load up the longboats and sail to ports. You do all the hard work only to throw a bunch of 1s or 2s in the third port, then Gregor the Red pops in to snatch the last port and grabs the rune card. Kinds makes you bitter when you're 90 minutes into the game. 

Reminiscent of History of the World, it is highly playable and best with 5. Because all players can't go for the saga cards (three open at a time) players also raid and settle, killing off saga cards later on, hence ending the game quickly. And that's good for everyone.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Solid fun with pretty easy rules to explain. There's enough player interaction without actually going to blows and nice time pressure. When those sagas pop-up, people have to think long and hard how long to stock the ship and how many days to sail after that. Staying too long in the shore gives a strong ship, but a lighter ship gets a head start.Cards bring a nice balance to the game and overall it's feels like a very satisfying game.

This game was even better than I expected. I really like that it isn't totally focused on battles, but also a nice mix of quests and deliveries. Player turns flow smoothly and there's always something important to do. There's almost too many options. I know a lot of people will complain about the amount of dice in the game, because raiding is very appealing thematically, but it's also the biggest gamble. There's a chance you'll go home empty handed, but if you win you'll win big. Sometimes it's better to take the guaranteed points from delivering goods.
Another thing I really must praise- Fire & Axe is a work of art. Beautiful components and artwork.  

Overall: I love almost everything about Fire & Axe. It's a shame it's such a rare title. More people deserve to experience this great game.

RATING: 6
 A sort of reverse scavenger hunt, where you load your viking ship with men and trade goods at home, then venture out to spend them trading, raiding, and settling. It is not a combat game, which surprised me given the theme. Competition comes from fulfilling "sagas," which are cards that list two or three specific accomplishments; they are public and the player who completes the saga (not the one who starts it or contributes most) gets the victory points for it. It's theme-rich and good lightweight fun, but may be unsatisfying to gamers looking for a developmental game or a deeper challenge.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a solid game with a nice simulation feel to it.  The available options and the Saga deck work to drive a historically plausible pattern of activities, so the big picture stuff is pretty good. The game falls a bit flat for me on the small picture stuff. The rhythm of 'do stuff, spend a turn building up (wintering), then do a turn or two more stuff' kind-of works.  However, as the guts of the game is a race to complete tasks, a lot of time is spent micromanaging the wintering: "If I leave port with only 2 men and a fur, then I can move 4 areas and beat Pat to port X".  I think the randomness in the game is misapplied: some randomness in movement would alleviate the micromanagement, while reducing the randomness in combat would help minimize the horrible swings of fortune where someone rolls 3 dice to settle a "2" town and loses 3 guys, where another player takes a punt on sacking Constantinople with one sailor and succeeds.  I quite like randomness in games where it forces you to adapt your plans on the fly, but here more often than not, the randomness simply tells you: "you are a step closer to winning" or "you are a step closer to losing" with no real come back. Neil's idea of randomizing turn order would also help reduce the micromanaging. A worthy attempt and reasonable game, but one that feels like it could have been tweaked to greatness.

Best and only Viking-themed game I've ever played.  I found myself a little bored with the choices, as the decisions seemed too straightforward for much of the game.  But perhaps that's because I didn't realize the relative strengths of different options.  I had misunderstood one rule during the game--I thought that the settlement scoring was kind of a monopoly rule--if you own all three, then you triple the value.  Knowing the real rule, partial settlement of color groups seems a much more likely option, and the decisions throughout are probably more interesting.  I definitely need to play again to firm-up my rating.

Viking Fury Edition: The rules might seem long and complex, but once the game flow is understood, I find that this one plays at a reasonable pace.  One feature I like is the multiple paths to victory (points).  Nicely themed offering a race element (complete sagas - but only the person who actually completes them gets the points) with an overall strategy of where and what to do at the various locations.

I enjoy this game quite a bit, and love the tension resulting from not wanting someone else to finish what you started.  The luck is high, but it doesn't bother me in this package.  I'm eager to see the nicer bits.

UPDATE: The luck bothered me more in the last four-player game.  (It's possible the effect was cumulative, as there a number of luck-heavy games that day stomping on my last nerve!)  I certainly didn't see any need to play with the red dot cards that introduce even wilder and swingier effects.  Given the way I was hammered by dice, I need to remember to take trade goods along to soften up important raid/settlement sites.

I have really, really tried liking this game.  I have tried it as both "Viking Fury" and as "Fire and Axe."  Unfortunately, it is still dry, monotonous, and unthematic.  I do not get a Viking theme at all.  Maybe the problem is that I have only played it with 3 players.  Because there are 3 continents and 3 saga cards, it is possible for each of us to do our own thing independently of each other.  Maybe it needs 4 or 5 players to get really interactive and fun.  Sadly, I doubt I will make the effort to find out.

A solid, enjoyable game. It's a weird midway between a Euro and an Ameritrash game, and I think it would have been better if it had gone further in one direction or the other, e.g. by including player combat (more Ameritrash), or removing the rune cards (more Euro). It's also about one third too long for what you get in the box. The sagas (mission cards) and the sailing mechanism work well to push the game along.

Great components too, and if you're into minis, there are heaps of nice ones for you here.

If you're considering buying this, take a look at the FFG Britannia first. It's a slightly longer game, but it does everything Fire and Axe does a lot better.

Contrary to the English title this is a Vikings game that manages to incorporate the different aspects of Viking life into a fun and challenging game. Either trade, settle or - of course - pillage, loot and burn to get victory points. There are so many ways to make victory points that it is difficult to know who is in the lead, which is a good thing, because it effectively avoids analysis paralysis. The rune cards are a welcome addition to introduce an element of chaos and screw-you into the game, which would otherwise become stale and boring soon. So far I really, really like it. Looking forward to more plays.

Plenty of racing around doing stuff with nice bits. I like that there's a lot of options to choose from on your turn, but they're not paralysis inducing difficult options.

This one's a bit of a puzzle.  We finally got it to the table after almost two years of owning it unplayed, and I'm not sure how I feel about it.  From the rules, you can see how the individual pieces of the design work, but the "big picture" is elusive.  Then you start to play, and after the initial learning curve of how to handle the sailing limits and manage the risks of raiding, you start to get a feel for the whole thing.  At the end, when the sagas are claimed at an increasing rate and every nook and cranny of the board is exploited, and finally when the settlement overscoring dominates play, it left me a little cold and wondering if it was four hours well-spent.  I think a tighter two-hour version would be quite a good game, but as is it will come out only occasionally at best.

[2 plays] Fire & Axe will play in about 30 minutes per player once everyone knows the game. I also think I could teach it in about 15 minutes now.

I recommend almost everyone play this with the confrontational "red diamond" rune cards. These cards make up about 1/3rd of the deck and keep the game spicy and interactive in a very nice way - if your group can handle some "screw you" moments.

Fire & Axe has excellent production values, the game play options are fairly straightforward, and the objectives and scoring are clear. The sea movement will be tricky at first, but within several turns everyone playing should have them down.

I enjoyed this very much and I think my only reservation was with the game length, which should not be any problem going forward. Related to that, I suspect a 4 or 3 player game may even be better than 5.

I feel more like a Viking warrior tribe playing this game than I felt like a noble warlord in Warrior Knights for a comparison in thematic  strength.

Light, simple and VERY tactical, in that your ship status resets all the time (but then, it's vikings, for Odin's beard!). All in all, however, smoothly incorporates all the main elements of the viking age, and it can be (fast-paced) fun. One gripe I have is the tenuous link each player has with their homeland, which seems to detract character from the experience (although I'm ignorant as to how closely interbred and connected the various Scandivanian domains were at the time).

This should be retitled Fire and Accounting.

I love a good pick up and deliver game, but this is less about picking up and more a linear delivery point accumulation game, where you roll to see if you were successful in delivering.  Meanwhile there are a bunch of screw you cards that blow up your hard work.  

To top all of this, the Saga cards give points to a person that can complete the Saga, so everyone is overly cautious about setting people up to score off of the work that they do.  You do all the work, the closer gets all the scoring.  I feel that we should be past this in modern game design.

The downtime is brutal.  Worse, it is justified.  It is all the overthinkiness of Java with none of the reward.  

On your turn you are presented with a puzzle, you see if you can optimize the points for it.  Min/max hell.  Roll to see if your plan was successful. After you have completed your puzzle (usually just moving in a straight line from the north center), you start over again.  There is no sense of exploration or building your empire to use what you have built. So it feels dry and repetitive. 

The luck is too extreme for the work, and the work isn't rewarding enough to justify the effort.

The wind mechanic is cool, and the board is pretty, but the game itself is arduous and irritating.  I felt like I was wearing a hair shirt.

All in all, for this kind of game I'd much rather play Serenissima.

It's a good game, I'm happy to play it. Not hard to learn at all, but a lot of hard decisions to make. I like the risk and trade-off of raiding/settling/trading etc that gives you points but also makes it easier for opponents to complete objectives. The mechanics are smooth and make sense, hardly any 'special/exception' rules to remember.  2 player games go quite long so I'd recommend removing a few more Saga cards (another 2 cards per Saga). My only gripe is I would have liked the board to look 'prettier' - it does look a bit dull. I think this game is a solid 7, but I wouldn't say it's super awesome - there's better games you can buy at that price point. Really good viking thematics !

It's a pretty long game and you can get screwed on the random bits. And, if another player isn't thinking, he can set you up pretty well. But there's plenty of room for creative play and even though there is no viking-on-viking action (and seriously, who wants to view that?), there is violence to be had and bonus points for the Bloodiest Axe. If I could play this with a group semi-regularly, I'd have my longboat itch itched (I'm so sick of people having certain itches scratched!).

I actually like this game a lot! It has a very nice flow and feel when you roam around ind your longboat trading, raiding and settling to complete sagas and becoming the most rich and famous viking :)

Perhaps a bit chaotic, but a fun Viking trade and plunder game.  The Rune cards add for crazy unpredictability, and I might filter some of them out to get back to the Viking Fury original.  However, I really enjoyed the Sagas, as they provide some direction, and there are plenty of things to do.  I think the game is actually best with three or four, since it reduces the chaos and downtime; we played it with five.

An interesting Ameri-Euro hybrid. It has lots of atmosphere and some interesting choices. My main gripe with the game is its length, both in time and the number of turns. This easily takes three hours, but if it's a sunspenseful three hours, that wouldn't be much of a problem. Towards the end of the game, everything that could be done has been done; you never wish you just had that one extra turn to do this or that and score some extra points. Otherwise, I could have rated it higher, because it *is* fun t play.

RATING: 7
I really like the idea of a viking game.  There are plenty of things done right, from the limiting of actions per turn, to the different ways of scoring.  The game really is fun.  But:The cards are TOO random.  Some offer a small gain, while others virtually eliminate a single player of your choice from contention.  I really hate this.  Likely the game needs to have certain cards simply removed from the game.  It takes the fun right out of it.  Either make attacking other players a game mechanic, or don't.  None of this random draws that hurt other players instead of benefiting you.  The dice are somewhat annoying, but iI can put up with them due to the fact that the odds can be manipulated with the help of cards, or trading before attacking.  I really did enjoy the game, and would play again.  The game is not one that I would buy though, as the cards are really annoying.  I would really like to remove more of the luck as I'm sure there is a way to make the game better by making attacks without the polygonal plastic pieces of hate.

This is a great game with a very well integrated theme.  plenty of opportunity to make your own win--you can even choose to stay (for the most part) out of people's way and avoid interaction or be right in the thick of the confrontations.  There is luck, however it usually is not the game winner/breaker but we did experience one game where a single player had absolutely abyssmal dice luck, repeatedly missing rolls where a 3 or better would succeed.  Had she had even nominally better luck, she probably would have won the game.

RATING: 7.7
Another game which needs house rules to play (as well as house rules to play with two players) - place ten markers on unsettled cities at gamestart - take-that cards can only mess with the settlements (do not use the take-that cards which reference Longships) - take from the supply, or replace settlements with your own.

Components are nice Except for (1), the breaking plastic ships - will need to be replaced (mine 1 DOA).   Except for (2), the game board is artful, but adds little to gameplay.  As well, the game play seems to be limited by the cards - designed with chance and painful play (less interesting thematically).

May 2017 After several plays and rules additions, we have still to arrive at a suitable 2-player variant. All but 2 of the ships have broken masts.

There's plenty of "Viking saga" going on here, but not quite enough fire or axe.  But at least I knew this going in.  I was initially quite excited by the looks of this game when it was first released, but when I discovered that it wasn't a "bash your neighbouring Vikings" game, but more of a "disappointingly historically accurate" game, I decided to give it a pass.  Then I found out that it was going out of print and would not be re-released, and I made a panicked purchase, realizing that the component quality alone made this game worthy of my collection.  Plus, I've been enjoying "Bootleggers" quite a bit, and was hoping that this would be another well-themed, fun to play, Euro-style game.  And then I played it and found myself trying to roll higher than city numbers to raid cities and trying to roll higher than city numbers to settle cities and trying to roll higher than city numbers when Rune cards were played against me...  Yeah, it got a little repetitive after a while.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing until you also consider the game length - I think next time we might play with 4 or 5 Saga cards from each era instead of 6.  So in a nutshell, this game scores big points for the absolutely beautiful production quality (best city pieces EVER!), but the fun factor tends to decrease as the game wears on (and you'd have to work hard to score a low fun factor in a Viking game!).  With a few small tweaks... http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/46245/five-mini-variants ...this game scores a 7.5 instead of a 7 with the "as is" rules.  I'm very glad I ended up picking up this edition, but with the game now being sold in the old, inferior component quality version, I can't imagine it would be a worthwhile purchase.  Game design: 4/5  Personal enjoyment: 3/5  Total: 7/10

Actually quite interesting,  At first you venture out and grab as many VP as you can.  The easy VP become more and more difficult to acquire, and thus the planning increases.  The game seemd fluid and played rather quickly.  Now this isnlt a great game, the cards are tremendously powerful, and frequently can only be used against one person,  who may or may deserve or need a beatdown.  In all this is a solid game.

I've had trouble getting my games group interested in playing this.  They hear an estimated playing time of 2 hours, and unless it's Power Grid they don't want to hear about it ...  That's a shame, because this is actually quite a good game--not in Power Grid's league, certainly, but still quite good.  I love the tea towel map, though it would be nice if some of the spaces were a bit larger.  This one's definitely a keeper.

Played once.  There's some really neat mechanics that are reasonably thematic.  First you can come with open arms and trade with the locals.  Next you can raid their city defences (If you've been to trade first you have a better idea of the lay of the land and raiding is easier :)  And finally if there's no city present (perhaps because you burnt it down) you can settle the land.
I also like the action point system and the boat capacity where you can bring vikings or goods to trade and you have to make a trade off depending on your goal of your current mission.  
The things I didn't like were the following: 
1) the scoring:  There are saga cards but who ever finishes the saga gets the glory so you don't really want to start one unless you can finish it on the same turn.
2) the dice:  The combat system is all or nothing.  There will be three or four rolls that are really critical for you for finishing a saga or not (being killed off and sent back home) during the game.  (18 sagas in total, perhaps not all finished and split between 3 to 5 players; i.e. you will finish roughly 3 to 6 sagas and some will require dice rolling and some won't).  If you roll well those critical times you kick ass and if you don't... well... you must just be a weak viking and some cherry picker gets all the glory.
3) the length to randomness ratio.  I don't mind randomness in a short game because you sing viking rowing songs, kill the locals, fight for the bloodiest axe and wrap it up in an hour and a half and play something else.  This is too think-y with the action point system and it doesn't provide the think-y reward because of the dice and therefore outstays it's welcome at 2-2.5 hours. 2009/05/06

Pick-up and deliver with some cards thrown in. Strong theme, but execution... 
1. Look at goals (the sagas) and perhaps load some stuff for added benefit
2. Go to wherever you need to be and roll the dice.
3. Sprinkle in some well timed cards. 
4. Repeat.
Boring. Board art doesn't grab me either.

Heavy 'take that' or 'woot I got this card perfectly executed'. Shrug, continue. There is no direct combat, few empire building (just put out some settlements for points), no discoveries, no upgrades. Would like to play A Game of Thrones or Chaos in the Old World over this ANY time. Pass.

After two games I do not really like this game. Too much luck, and a bit too long. Its strength lays in its theme so if somebody is a fan of vikings he will like it.

Some comments in Hungarian:
Nagyobb lélegzetvételű játék. Az első parti után világossá vált, hogy a Saga kártyákra elég erősen kellett volna koncentrálni. A Runa kártyákat is jobban kéne használni.
Kicsit olyan most mint a Railroad Tycoon, de persze nem tetszik annyira. Kicsit sok az adminisztráció, de itt is több parti kell ahhoz, hogy belőjük, melyik stratégia mennyit ér.
Még fogok vele játszani, viszont csakis klubban, mert ahhoz túl hosszú, hogy otthon előkerüljön. (Az első parti utáni vélemény, ahol csak néző/játékmester voltam.) 

2009.06.04: no, mostmár játszottam 2-szer úgy mint játékos. A Rúna kártyák elég specifikusak, mindegyiket csak egy bizonyos különleges szituációban lehet használni. Szerintem nem lehet rájuk stratégiát építeni, pláne, hogy csak 3 lehet a kezünkben. így itt is a szerencse dönt, hogy megkapod-e azt a kártyát, amelyikre szükséged van az éppen aktuálisan feljövő Saga kártya teljesítéséhez.

Theme and mechanics blend well here, but Fire and Axe feels like it could use a bit more polish. It's a big, sweeping, epic affair, as a Viking game should be. My main quibbles with the game are that it goes on a bit too long (good luck getting in a game under the 90 minutes advertised, unles it's with very experienced and motivated players) and the the get-the-leader bashing that invariably results from the cards (which range from useless to overpowered). Need to play a few more times, but I'm guessing Fire and Aze may end up on the pile of "near miss" games - meaty, ambitious designs that don't quite fulfill their potential.

Games probably take a little too long for the degree of randomness (dice rolling, types of Rune cards) and luck involved, but the game is awfully fun and strategic (lots of different scoring options). If we can get the game down to 1.5 hours, it would be ideal. Beautiful artwork and components. The only thing I wish is if the Rune cards were a little closer in value, but there is a huge difference in level of usefulness between cards. Very nice game, nonetheless. This game is definitely better with more people as there is more interaction.

Fire and Axe blends an optimization engine with quite a bit of luck (dice and cards) to create a Euro game of Nordic conquest.  Production values are excellent, although the board is too busy.

UPDATE: No reason this brilliant game is not a 10 so let's put it there! I've found no real flaws with this game. It feels like the perfect blend of Euro style game plays and AT type of game-banging. I love it.

I love this game. Chance, strategy, and time manegement all play a part. There are many paths to victory. The theme is very well integrated into this game. It just FEELS like a Viking game. The first time I read the rules I thought that the end game points might be game breaking. But after a few games I see that they are ballenced within the game system. If you like Vikings, this is a Must Have!

(1 play) The first play took a little long, but I definitely enjoyed this one. There's some 'chicken' involved, and it's one of those games where its best to stay out of competitions except where you see you can win. Winning the game contributed to my positive impression, but not that much, I think. Others at my table thought there was too much luck, but I would disagree -- there is some randomness, but a bout of bad luck is far from the end of the world, and I suffered some bad luck along with the others.

En puertos puedes comerciar, saquear o colonizar, aunque no el mismo puerto en el mismo turno. Se pueden completar misiones o sagas, aunque la completa el ultimo que coloniza, saquea o comercia en una region. Mezcla mecanica euro-temática pero con dados. Parecido al merchant pero demasiados dados para un juego sin posibilidad de combate

This is a game that spans the time of the Viking Sagas. The epic journeys that led Norsemen to raid, trade and settle over the known and unknown territories of the northern hemisphere.

The perfect game for when you want to kick some ass, but not those of your gaming buddies.  Hold medieval Europe to ransom as you plunder and pillage your way through the Age of Vikings.

I stand alone in my group in my slight distaste for the game - everyone else gets a surge of enjoyment from it and don't mind the luck when attacking ports. I can also see how the game has a certain appeal and enjoy the variety of options available. It has tremendous components, a good, imbedded theme, and is simple enough to be explained to new players with ease. I usually don't mind luck in games, and only rant about it here because it can be extremely important at small, critical junctions in the game - and in a two-hour game - I don't necessarily want that. This is certainly a game to try before picking up, as your views may (and probably will) vary. See my review for more details...

Played the new Fire and Axe edition six times with 3 and 5 players, and I loved it, even though I have to admit that the amount of dice rolling is not everyone's cup of tea! The game (and especially the board) is beautiful to look at and really invites you to sail out and explore. The rules are not complex, but there are quite a lot of them, so take your time when explaining them to nongamers. The game itself is heavy on theme and quite random (especially with the new cards, but leave them in just the same!), but still quite balanced in the long run, and you never feel out of the race. As a matter of fact, each time was only a relatively small difference in score for all players. Our first game took 3.5 hours and the second even 4, but time flew by. The perfect marriage of euro and ameritrash feel and mechanics.
UPDATE 2014: We still love this game. Proof that games have not necessarily got better in recent years.

RATING: 7
Tried this game at game night. Started late and we had to end it after nearly three hours with only 4 Age cards to go... started slow as we didn't do a thorough play-through of the rules. More or less learned as we went and by the end of the game we had the play phases and movement types secure enough to enjoy a smooth transition from player to player.  Enjoyed it a lot! the Rune cards cards inject a lot of chance and 'magic' to each player's turn so it is not the most strategic game. The variety f point gathering mechanisms though keep everyone in the game and leaves multiple avenues to stay engaged. No such thing as a friendly Viking!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a decent game of raiding and trading, but so much of the score isn't counted until the end.  It makes the scoring during the game seem completely meaningless.  Also, the way the game is structured, there seems to be little profit in starting any multi-part goal because with the slightest run of bad luck, someone else will just come and finish it for you.

RATING: 4
Hard to rate, because even though I enjoyed playing Viking Fury, (all 3-4 hours of it where I was the obvious runaway loser after hour 1, and there was one obvious runaway winner after hour 2), I have no interest in ever playing it again. It plays very similarly to a dungeon crawl, where you load up on equipment in the center of the map, then voyage out individually to kill monsters and take their treasure (raid and settle towns). There's almost no interaction and significant downtime which is not a good combination. That said, the Viking theme makes it fun and thankfully all the parts work reasonably well. However, I can attest to the fact that it is very possible to get totally screwed by the dice and have no way to make up for it. There's not really enough randomness to even out over the course of the game, and as is typical of these sorts of games, it's not the player who most successfully manages risk who comes out ahead, but the one who manages to fail the least. Also some of the rune cards are clearly better than others. On the other hand, there is certainly some room in this game for strategy and clever play.

Update: This review is for the Ragnar Bros. version, although it appears that the Asmodee reprint did nothing to address my issues with the game.

I've only played twice, so this rating is still provisional, but, man, I've fallen head over heels in love with this game.  It does everything right.

Update: I sold my copy because, as much as I like the game, it didn't get played often. Each time I got it out, I had to learn the rules all over again. It's still fun, but the random elements detract from the game. I'm too much of an abstract/strategy fan to really embrace even this little bit of chaos. Still, this is one of the best thematic games that I've played.

You must attempt to acquire the saga cards.  If you don't get majority in something, someone else will.  That means you're only making a few interesting blocking decisions each game, everything else is "which saga card can i complete most efficiently".  the other "strategy" bits, like getting the bloody axe bonus or having lots of settlements-  are secondary considerations to this, things you just kind of do "along the way" while you're accomplishing sagas.

Rather fun mechanics, but just a bit more randomness than I would like.  The last game was decided by just 3 victory points, yet the VPs from conquering large cities range from 8-16 points (random, you only know the value after you take them!).   One Saga card can easily make a 20 point swing also (the one that gives points per settlement).

Rollicking fun.  I've played  a lot, and have never seen it fall flat with people looking for a heavily-themed affair.  Much more focused on short-term tactical gain than long-term strategic planning.  Dice have a significant, but not overwhelming effect on the outcome.  Beautiful components.  Learning the differences between raiding and settling and trading is awkward and could use a player aid.  This game melds itself wonderfully to the group.  People can get take that action by taking cards, or you can peacefully (well, among the other players anyway -- the raided peoples might feel otherwise) go about your business of sailing around and not bothering anybody.  It's funny.  In a lot of ways, this is everything that a pirate game should be... but it's a viking game.  Go figure.

Gorgeous looking game, that's fun as well. I know some complain about not enough "fire & axe" aka not enough pillaging and interaction, but my wife stole two groups of 3 cities I had settled. I got "fire and axed" right up the wazoo. :( 

Perhaps ran a touch long, as you have to complete every single card in the deck to end the game. I've seen suggestions to remove a few extra cards, I think I might try that.

Turns out we played for substantially longer than we should have, since the rules explainers forgot to remove cards from the deck.

This was a grail game for a long, long, time. The recent reprint is gorgeous, with nice linen finish cards and awesome plastic miniatures. The new map is a stylized map of Europe, Asia and Africa done in wood tones. It's quite pretty, although it does impede its clarity at times. It's also a little baffling why the game has you bury the trade goods under the town markers and then again under the colony figures later on. Considering you need to be able to reference what is there at a glance and often would prefer not to telegraph your plans, it's kind of a bad gaffe. It was done this way in previous iterations as well, so I am surprised no one thought of addressing it in the reprint.

That's a fairly minor nuisance for what is otherwise a fun experience. The decision tree can be a little mathy, because almost all the points are gained at game's end, so it can sometimes be hard to tell who is in the lead. Generally speaking that doesn't bother me in games and can in fact, add to drama of the final turns. In this case though, not having that information can crank up the negotiation and king-making aspects of the game significantly, to what might be unacceptable levels for some folks. The game has a lot of take that card play, so again, the obfuscated scoring encourages a lot of bickering.

If you enjoy that sort of thing, you'll love this game. If you don't, I don't think it is quite bad enough that you'd automatically hate it, but I'd try before you buy. If you are indifferent and just like good games, this one is a Euro-American style hybrid well worth checking out, especially for the twenty or thirty bucks it's going for at the moment.

Fire & Axe has great components (though the Prepare and Sail markers are too small and graphically muddled), and really comes together coherently.

As usual my introductory game, I totally mucked up and the game certainly deserves a replay to do it justice. There's enough there to warrant that it's a reasonable enough strategy to the game and generally you can counter the roll of the dice luck element. The rune cards can screw you, so there's a bit of chaos there and there's a bit of luck of being in the right place at the right time with the vp cards, but it's all good fun. First play was a 5 player game and it took 3 hrs with 30 mins rule explanation say. So it was a little long for my liking. If I could play it in 60-90 mins I'd be happier!

A good euro with some mixed mechanics. Runs a bit long but that could be remedied by adjusting the saga cards. There is a definite order to follow: trade, raid, settle. I would've liked a bit more direct conflict somehow, like attacking player settlements since the only way for settlements to change hands is via rune cards. If it played in two hours or less I'd like it a bit more, I'd also like to take another stab at it strategy-wise. Overall a bit dry and too long for me.

Oodles of fun, provided your idea of fun is something along the lines of getting randomly shafted by poorly balanced, entirely opportunistic Rune cards that follow the principle of pay to shaft, shaft. Basically, one player pays to draw Rune cards, then shafts somebody else with them because heck, they've already invested in the card so might as well use it right? Naturally this process is to the detriment of both parties because the uninvolved come out ahead, and - get this - you can pitch cards to change wind direction, but you can change the wind direction anyways when you play the card, so there's NO REASON NOT TO RANDOMLY SHAFT SOMEONE. Did I mention this game also has plenty of intrinsic dice rolling? Expect scenarios where one person rolls to raid or settle in an area, fails due to poor luck, and another player comes in and nabs the points, resulting in player-to-player final score variances of 30-40%, solely on account of a single turn of screwy dice. Could be norse, I guess.

I got this for my birthday, and have so far only played it one time, so my rating will probably change as i play it more.   But I really loved this game.   The Asmodee edition is beautiful, with a beautiful map, and cool viking figurines with sad faces(they look tired and heavy-hearted, somehow, which makes me feel bad sending them off to raid and settle).   The game had a good amount of strategy available, and with only seven action points but multiple things you want to do every turn, some fun, hard decisions to make.  But, really, for right now, this game is just really fun and really cool to play.  Loading up your ship with men and heading down the atlantic to attack Rome gives you a great feeling.  The group I played with all enjoyed it and didn't care who won or lost(except for Chris-who won), we all just had a great time playing it.  And right now, I just want to play again fast.  With more plays my rating may go down, but I get the feeling it's only gonna go up.  (to like an 8.6 or 8.7!)

After 1 play: a bit long-ish, but I can see playing time going down with more experience. Lots of luck, but that's OK. The targeted nastiness didn't work for me in this game, or maybe I'm just pissed that they all had to revolt MY settlements in this game :P The scoring is all over the place, a little more focus would have been nice. The saga cards are very strong and you seem to need them to win, but they are also pretty random. All in all a interesting game, but I can't shake the feeling that this one could have gone through a few more iterations of developmental polishing to make it truly shine.

Exciting competition between Vikings. There are a lot of swing of faith. Funny game.

After 1 Play: I doubt I'd play this again, unless I was convinced it would go a lot faster.  Too much luck for a game of this length.  I really hate how the game forces you to do all this planning (by loading up your ship before you sail off), and then destroys all the planning with a few die rolls.  If I'm going to get screwed by the dice that's fine, but a game like that needs to a.) not have me make detailed plans before getting screwed and b.) allow me press on after the screwage, adapt, and find a plan B.  There is nothing more frustrating than having to go back to the start line repeatedly after a run of bad luck.

A little bit repetitive and simple, but it has Vikings and an awesome map.

[My version is the German one, bitte.]

Good game, but not my type. Takes also a bit too long. Nice material though.

I'm still trying to decide if I enjoy this game or not. It seems like there's so very little interaction - the competition for the completion of sagas being one of the few things one can 'fight over'.

++ The components and artwork are impeccable.
+  The balance of luck and tactical choices is refreshing.
-  The game is slightly longer than it warrants.
-- The fact that the other players are sitting there as well barely matters.

A bit random, but fun otherwise. The lack of direct conflict will annoy some players.

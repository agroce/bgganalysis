RATING: 8.6
The low ratings for this game utterly baffle me. Perhaps it's because fans of the Monte Cristo novel find the theme pasted on (which it most certainly is)?

The rules are absurdly vague and convoluted, but simple, nevertheless. The gameplay, however, is a brainburner with the most important decisions being where to place one's marble after one has performed a phase. 

A surprisingly deep game and just a tad on the dry side in spite of Micheal Menzel's exquisite art.

RATING: 7.5
I like it.  The marbles are a bit unnecessary and seem to be more of a marketing thing, but they are cool to have and certainly don't detract from the game itself.  Speaking of the game itself, it's relatively straightforward, with simple mechanics and short turns.  Yet, enough depth lies underneath to satisfy most strategy gamers.  I also like the theme--searching dungeons for treasure!  I think this is an excellent gateway game, given all these points.

RATING: 7
The Secret of Monte Cristo is a good game but it has a flaw in its system when it comes to two-player games. The main mechanic of this game is an action slide on which marbles are placed that determine the order in which players take certain actions. There are four actions that are done each turn (getting supply boats, placing workers in the Chateau D'if, allocating treasure into the Chateau and rearranging the order of either the marbles in the action slide or the gems in the market for scoring) and who gets to perform those actions is determined by whose color marble its at the bottom of that particular slide. It seems straight forward but the rearrange action you can take in the 4th action slide can make the game incredibly swingy. In a 2 player game each player receives 6 marbles as opposed to 4 marbles in a 3-4 player game. In our recent game due to all those marbles being present I managed to rearrange the action slide so that I did all the actions that turn thus blocking my wife from getting a single action. Subsequent to that it meant she could not get a rearrange action until the following turn. That allowed me to also get the first three actions on the next turn again. Yep, if you're doing the math that meant I got 7 straight actions after rearranging. This allowed me to get so many supply boats, workers in the chateau and treasures placed that I won after only 2 scoring rounds and I won by 33 points! Now in a 3-4 players game due to each player only having 4 marbles it will be very difficult to pull off what I did thus making the game not so swingy. But as we play our games 90% of the time 2-player that means this game doesn't work for us. We like games where it is balanced enough that one of us cannot CRUSH  the other. And Secret of Monte Cristo doesn't provide that.

I thought this was ok. We played it 3 player, with Brett winning 42, 36, 33. Choice seem pretty cut and dried every turn. Get workers, get them in dungeons where you have the matching bags for the jewels in that dungeon. Timing of scoring rounds seemed to be key in our game. And the marble mechanism is a neat one. I'll keep this around for a while.

This is a tentative rating. We played about half a game and were forced to quit, but since the turns continue in the same fashion for the rest of the game, I think I got the feel for how it works. There is a lot to like in this game. The fact that you have to coordinate like 4 different things in order to maximize your scoring is really neat. It's one of those kind of games where the rules aren't all that difficult, but I can see it takes some forethought and planning to be good at the game. The marble-board for action selection is one I've never seen before, and I quite enjoyed it. I look forward to playing this again soon and locking in my opinion.

Pretty simple game that has more depth to it than appears
Just as the recent release of "The Three Musketeers" movie has nothing to do with the book, there's no connect of this game to the book either. I almost think an Old West mining theme would have made this more appealing...

Sort of a worker placement mixed with a novel turn order mechanism. Very light. 2 players I used the variant of removing 2 Castles with 2 players and it was very tight. Had a runaway leader however came back only to get destroy in the last turn. Made it compelling. Will have to play a few more time to give it a final grade. Not as bad as everyone made it. Reminded me of Thebes with a novel turn order. Traded Away

Juego de selección de acciones mediante un sistema curioso de grandes canicas de colores. En la caja pone una duración de 45-60 minutos pero en las dos partidas que hemos jugado se nos ha ido a unos 90 minutos.

First impression: kind of strange experience! Interesting new mechanism with the 'action slide', nice graphics and components, but dull und almost complete random game play. I see a lot of possibilities in there, but don't think I'll play it enough to exploit them.

The good: Top notch production value. Lots of player interactions (therefore 4 players is the optimal number).
The bad: Can't form a reliable strategy because of heavy influence on other players decisions. Feels random because too many things can affect results.
Rules: I think dungeon space should be limited to 6 to stop arm race; leaving it open can't stop that.

Fun worker placement.  Really like the marble track forcing turn order to be super important but pre programmed for a few turns so you have to be looking several turns ahead to make sure you don't short yourself on a given turn.  Also like that you can really fight over dungeon placement with your opponents.

A medium light family game with opportunities for strategy.

Upon seeing the beautiful, colorful board, I knew immediately it was Michael Menzel's art work.  

The uniqueness of the marble slide (which determines player order), is a clever gimmick which mechanizes what otherwise would be a fiddly adjustment in the game.  This slide uses big heavy, colorful marbles which roll down as a player removes his marble, uses the representative action, and then relocates it on the slide.  Very slick.

Rules are very simple, but still needed several clarifications, only to discover I was playing some things incorrectly, much to my surprise.

The contents store very nicely in the box which means the chute stays intact and doesn't need to be broken down & reassembled each game. 

It is a game that will be fun to play occasionally.

Nice looking game that is not that much fun, not to mention not fitting the original story.  The ball rack is very nice, but it is basically a game of manipulating the gem market while using worker placement to claim gems.  I liked it OK, but would not seek out a game of it.

RATING: 4
I really hoped to like this one. I mean, come on, it has marbles! Cool, right? And it's got a great presentation too. Alas, I found this to be nothing but extreme frustration. The game's main appeal, the marble slide, is nothing more than an elaborate turn order manipulation system. Games in which turn order is very important tend to rub me the wrong way to begin with, but this one goes a couple steps further. You'd think that seeing that far ahead in the various turn order queues should allow you to plan your moves far in advance, but the actions you take are so short term and tactical, it hardly seems worthwhile. In fact I'd go so far as to say that real long term planning may be impossible. By the time your ball works its way back to the bottom, the state of the game will certainly be radically different from how it was when you made the choice. Furthermore, you can screw and be screwed by the sudden changes in turn order by jumping ahead (or being jumped over) in the action queues, adding to the frustration and lack of control.

Ok, so the marble system isn't really my thing. What else is there? Nothing especially innovative or exciting, just a worker placement/area majority hybrid which is dragged down by limited ability to plan or get a leg up on your opponents. In all, this is a game with one big attraction, and for me it fell completely flat. Others may find it interesting, but I'll be avoiding this one. Monte Cristo can keep its secret to itself.

Very pretty game, and not completely devoid of substance, though it's kind of fallen into the "meh" range.  There's nothing wrong with the game.  Turn order manipulation is very important, and the way it's managed with balls on a ramp, while somewhat gimmicky, is fun.  The cards require players to make an interesting tradeoff, and you are always wary of whether you are setting up the next person. It's well put together but ended up being kind of unremarkable for me.  If you like that sort of thing, try Hansa instead. (1 play)

It may grow on me but there are some ways you can break this game and be out of the game.  I don't think the designer thought of the problem we encountered.  Basically, a player put all there people on the board.  When the people are used they go back to a general supply.  They had no people left and no way to get people, thus creating a problem.  Yes it was there fault, and they played wrong, but this was there first time and I didn't catch it till the next turn, which was after scoring.  There needs to be something that says "you can't place your last person on any other place on the board than to recruit 3 more players....or you can take one of you players from the board/dungeon at anytime.  Regardless, because it is a light game I can see newer boardgame players making this mistake thinking "I need to place my people to score points.

RATING: 6
A fairly standard Euro with a reasonably interesting blend of mechanics. A bad combination of potential for AP with  a large dose of randomness. Fun opportunities to stick it to your opponents. The marble tracks are a novelty, but I'm not convinced there's much strategy to them.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 4
The theme rapes the original story; why would there be anything specifically valuable at Chateau d'If? I can't understand... The player order mechanism is a nice one, but could easily have been made without the marbles and everyone could be paying a bit less for the game. In this case one nice mechanism doesn't carry the game to the end. It gets really repetitive and you have pretty much seen the game after 2-3 scorings have taken place.

I'm not certain this game has many plays in it, but the central mechanism is interesting to play around with in this game.  I'm guessing this rating will decrease with future plays.

LIKES:

* Marble mechanism for determining who has the primary action is central to the game.  Whomever manages this turn order/action mechanism best is likely to win the game.  Not sure yet how much control exists but I enjoyed the concept.
* Rules are simple and straightforward.  I messed up teaching but that was my stupidity and not the game's.  

DISLIKES:

* Can drag if people take too long to consider their limited choices.  
* Marble ramp is not well constructed as it is bowing already in the middle.

From a designers viewpoint, this has a very interesting core mechanic, with the constant manipulation of turn order. A mechanic that I'm glad I've had the chance to explore.
But as a player, the game disappoints. It has long downtimes, analysis paralysis, and a theme that has no connection to the mechanics (this is normal for its class of games, but we are suckers for flavorful euros like Agricola and Dungeon Lords, so they don't live long in our group).
We are probably not going to play it again, but we had lots of laughs over lame ball-jokes.

On a personal note, I feel that the action slide looks attractive on the table, possibly more so than anything else that I've seen accompany a boardgame's board. The game itself is one of timing, area majority, and speculation. Not for those who demand a strong sense of control.

Despite the title, this game actually has little to do with the Dumas novel, which doesn't have any sneaking into castles to steal treasure.  No revenge to be found here.  As for the game itself, it had the very pretty gimmick of having colored balls indicate player actions, that slid down a track.  The balls weren't really necessary, and I don't see where they fit with the theme, but it was a nice touch.  The idea was that each round, there were a number of things to be done, and the person who controlled that action would determine how (by going first, distributing cards, etc.).  The game was somewhat entertaining, but ultimately felt like a cute gimmick with a game thrown around it (a little like Darjeeling).

A worker-placement game boiled down to its essence - little else is done outside of placing your workers to collect gems and manipulate the turn order or market value. There is no set collection, no variable victory conditions, and no trading - you just score the gems you collect according to their current market value.

As such, the game may not be as immensely satisfying as, say, [b]Tribune[/b] but there is a simple pleasure in removing all the bells and whistles to play just the core mechanic.

Also, the manipulation of the turn order (somewhat like the time track in [b]Thebes[/b]) really is what gives this game its flavor - and offers up some tough decisions and planning.

Simple yet elegant, though it may lack staying power.

[b]Edit:[/b] Raised this up a half a point - I simply love how it's a distilled worker placement game with no fluff!

This is a decent set collection/action point game with some neat components.

The game is played over a number of rounds with 4 phases in each round.  The first phase you collect cards with colored bags on them.  The second you place "workers" on a map or on special action spaces (where you can only place one worker per turn).  The third you place colored treasures on the map numbered 1-3.  Finally, you can reorder the action order or treasure valuation order.

During the third phase if one of the treasure locations on the map fills up the players sell their bags for the price on the treasure valuation chart and whoever has the most points on a turn where someone passes 40 wins.

The kind of nifty mechanic in this game has to do with the action order which is kept track of with colored balls on 4 slides.  After you take an action you move your colored ball to the top of one of the four slides.  This is a neat way to manage action points that adds some new decisions into the mix, I like it.

Kind of simple but with enough interesting decisions that it is thinky and fun enough to last a few plays.  I also really do dig the action order mechanic and the components themselves are pretty good quality.

Odd game built around a pointlessly-overproduced action-selection mechanism. Each round has four phases and the player to act in it is the one whose marble is at the bottom of the relevant track. In order, they are to draw and distribute resource cards (combination of bags, AKA money in a specific colour and new adventurers); to place adventurers (majority player in each dungeon can buy first); to place treasure in dungeons (for majority player to buy, also controls triggering of scoring round); and, lastly and of most interest, to either adjust prices in the market or adjust turnover.

In theory this kind of market manipulation is right up my alley but I'm not sure it really works. It all ends up feeling a little chaotic. No-one has quite enough control to know how much any given action will be worth, particularly because of the random draws. On the flipside, the number of points required to end the game is fairly low, so successfully manipulating the market such that you can buy a 3-gem with a 3x multiplier is almost 1/4th of the way to victory -- it just seems like this is as easy to luck into as it is to plan deliberately.

More dynamic and more interesting than I had been led to believe, though.

Visually attractive but overly light and repetitive treasure collecting game. The aim is to use explorers to collect a number of treasures hidden in dungeons in the  Château d'If situated on the island of If. The game's key mechanism is a constantly changing order of action selections, which include transporting explorers onto the island, placing them in dungeons, increasing the value of certain treasures etc, and mastering this area of the game to optimise your actions is the key to winning. The components are beautiful and the board is typical of Michael Menzel's wonderful artwork, however the action slide complete with marbles is definitely a case of over-production. There are major issues with repetitiveness too, as once the game has been played a couple of times you've pretty much seen all it has to offer.

Les mécanismes sont excellents, le thème est absent, le matériel est de belle qualité, mais ce qui frappe est l'impression de manque de contrôle. Tout le monde se plaignait d'avoir peu souvent l'occasion de jouer l'action, mais si tout le monde jouait premier régulièrement. Mais on contrôle alors seulement une portion du tour de jeu, ce qui laisse toujours l'impression de manque de contrôle.

Michael Menzel's gorgeous artwork and a giant marble-rolling gadget--what's not to like?  Actually, The Secret of Monte Cristo is this:  it's better to be beautiful.  TSoMC is a very diffuse title; there is so much to watch and the board changes constantly, with little semblance of control.  It's more stream of chaos with lots of shiny objects.  If you can ride the waves, you can put yourself in contention.  But no one I've been beaten by can describe HOW they won the game.

A pretty light game, comparable in depth to say Stone Age. It could certainly suit to be a gateway game of that capacity and may earn itself a place in my collection on that merit. Still it's just light and fun with a touch of random and some interesting mechanics.

This went surprisingly well! I had expected it to not play out so well with fewer marbles on the rack but in fact it was fun. I do think I prefer 4 players but wouldn't hesitate to play it 2 or even 3 now.

In the Alexandre Dumas novel The Count of Monte Cristo, the protagonist, Edmond Dantès, is imprisoned in the Chateau d'If for fourteen years, during which time he learns about a fortune hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. Eventually he escapes, boards a smuggling ship, then makes his way to the island, where he manages to recover the fortune.
But did he find all of value on the island? That's not what designers Arnaud Urbon and Charles Chevallier propose in Le Secret de Monte Cristo, coming from Filosofia in French, with eggertspiele and Z-Man Games releasing versions in German and English.
The players are smugglers who learned of the treasure from Dantès while traveling together, and now each of them has decided to search the island for any treasure that might remain. Each round players receive cards that show what type of treasure (gems) might be found in the castle, with the active player that round placing three smugglers in the castle and all other players placing one.

Once new treaure has been distributed in the castle rooms, players then take actions based on the order of the marbles showing in the game's "action slide" – this being a tilted rack with four slots in it, with a different action associated with each slot. The player whose marble is at the bottom of slot one takes that action, then places the marble at the top of any other slot; then the player at the bottom of slot two takes that action; and so forth.
Players can seize treasure from rooms if they outnumber the other smugglers present and they have the right sacks on hand for storing the treasure.

Wouldn't mind playing this game again, but found it to be a bit too generic for my taste. And looking around the table during play, I felt like I was not the only one who thought it was a bit lacking in the excitement department. The luck of the draw (treasures and cards) makes it difficult to plan ahead, so the most interesting choice to make is the one in which you decide on which track to put your marble. All in all, quite a forgettable experience.

Wanted to love this game, but just can't.  As others have noted, the game totally screws with the story of The Count of Monte Cristo.  I didn't think it would matter but it does.  But that's not even close to the biggest problem with this game - it's just a mishmash of mechanics detached from its theme.  It just felt like, "First you do this, then this, then this, and then . . . this . . . now you score.  First one to past 40 wins."  Gorgeous board.  Sad really.

Played twice. The turn order is controlled by a rack of marbles in rows above the 4 actions - draw and distribute cards, place workers, draw and distribute gems, manipulate turn order or gem value. The marble on the bottom determines turn order and then the player must move the marble to another action column. Scoring happens when a dungeon has 4 gems so the gem action controls the scoring round. Very clever game.

David Isby's Cambrai sim. Highly involved artillery rules reflecting the force multiplying effect of artillery that is rarely modeled in WW1 games. Lovely counters but a drab map even by WW1 game standards.

One of my favorites war games.  Being a Great War enthusiast I snapped this one up when it was first published back in '78.  Immediately fell in love with the system and the situation. My brother and I played it so much we almost wore out the counters and map. 

I think the system captures the feel of 1914-1918 combat well. The use of artillery is detailed, but not cumbersome. The rules for tanks and Stosstruppen are well written and really add spice the "conventional" combat. 

Many of the British artillery counters portrayed as longer range artillery (4-1-13's) are actually Army Field Artillery units which would be more accurately portrayed as 4-2-7's.

Lack of any fog of war or making of units allows the British player to snipe with their artillery at the German attack units.  

I would love to see some additional Great War battles done using this system--another great design by David Isby.

This seems like a lovely game, but it is really a mini-monster with the artillery game playing an appropriately important part in the course of the battle.  Never managed to find an opponent and the time to play it.  A real regret though.

RATING: 8.7
uniquely fun game, considering the period. The battle saw the first massive use or armoured forces in history: their mechanical reliability (or lack thereof) gives much reason for fun and frustration (depending on your side..). very interesting artillery rules; at the end the germans start getting Stosstruppen, to equalize the playing field. Great game.

Played once only..and didn't finish the game. Took a very long time to finish one game turn. By far, the most interesting battle of WW1 ....tanks and stosstruppen giving some limited blitzkrieg style advances.

I own the 2004 Decision Games/ Excalibre edition.  Quite a shock to me as to operational WW1 can be this good.  Tanks and air power are featured extensively.  Almost forgot WW1 had them too, apart from the mud and blood on the ground.  Not to miss this one.  This is the first operational game about WW1 I purchased.  And it is an upgraded edition (a lot has been upgraded indeed but I prefer the old red British units than the now brown) for a 26 years ago!  It shows how the game stands the test of time!  The rules are systematically and logically written and presented.  That alone worths the full price of the game.  The counters, however, are still the same old-fashioned as it was like other Decision Games products.  

We are familiar with the shoot-em-and-run-over-em tactics, aren't we.  Hand to hand fight with rifle charging, stepping on the mines and being blown up to pieces over the mud, and Hitler...Hitler was there in WW1.  Perhaps he was fighting just next to you when you made your charge towards the Allied trenches.   And artillery kept coming in.  Hell, war is hell. This Decision Games updated edition keeps almost everything in the original and upgraded the graphics of both the map and the counters.  The maps are tastefully functional.  The counters, as usual of DG's quality, are thinly done but otherwise well printed.  The rules are, after all these 20+ years, still one of the best I have ever read with a high degree of clarity, systematically and logically presented (despite some minor typos as well).  Some phenomenal features like breakdown of Royal Tanks, German Stoss infiltration tactics, Leapfrog withdrawal, infantry fatigue and rolling artillery etc. are spicing up the game to a classic level.  Few could do that before.  ZOC rules are generally locking (except for German Stoss units) but help offer a sense of intensity of WW1.  At least 4 types of artiellery fire are included.  You cannot knock off the smell of gunpowder for a while after you finished the game. Although no distinct supply phase, supply is required to attack by counting the supply "length" of movement costs (not hexes) to the road exiting the map edges or to the supply depot. Supply points are then deducted with reference to this length and supply markers are adjusted from the overall supply level.  So expect a lot of bean counting the "costs". Movement is halved but defense is normal when out-of-supply. With no less than many decisions to make each turn and a meaty 17-daily-turns campaign game, it is a polished, classical earthwork design.

A very interesting game that includes air units too!  The British get a special &quot;Tank Repair Phase&quot; per turn as both sides fight it out, one attacking with the &quot;new&quot; weapon the other figuring out how to defend against it.  The &quot;British Breakthrough&quot; scenario is my favorite.  A well done game.

Cette simulation rend très bien la dureté des combats, la difficulté de tenir une position. L'accent est porté sur l'artillerie mais avec beaucoup de chrome pour les alliées (commandement, intervention française, cavalerie, tanks).

Talk about troop density.  This game is it.  The British first use of massed tanks to attempt to break the Western Front stalemate in 1917. Tons and tons of British artillery to throw at the German trenches.  Easy to learn and fun to play.

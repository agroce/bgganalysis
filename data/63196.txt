New cards offer plenty of new options, ante altering cards provide more interactive play after gambit winners have been mostly confirmed mid-flight, and a continued dedication to excellently-rendered, yet simple, art. I have to applaud the addition of deck variants in the final portion of the rulebook, and appreciate the in-character fluff portions.

RATING: 5
Feels like playing a simple card game, nothing cool or weird in this game. Just another game without a prominent mechanic to get above the average game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An interesting fantasy themed trick-taking style game.  Plays fast and offers players interesting choices for how to best manage what is in their hands.

Good, but not as good as the original deck. The dragons are too similar in colour, and their in game effects aren't as interesting. Certain cards now have effects if they are used as an ante card, which is an interesting addition.

Honestly, I've found the best use for this version of the game is to mix it in with the original game, to allow for more players at once, and reduce the need to regularly shuffle the deck.

Went out and got the expansion after a few games went really well at my house.
This has become our version of poker night, we sit around and play with both whole decks for hours (I know that's not the rules, but it makes the game better in the long run).
The only thing we need is proper coins to play with, plastic pirate gold wears thin after a few dozen games.  (Although it gets a lot of attention out in public!)

RATING: 9
A great expansion to the original 3DA, with some interesting twists added to the game.  Some extra mortal cards who have great game changing aspects will bring some fun into the game, and the ante effects will also make you think twice about some of your old strategies.  Some minor problems with the new expansion - combining all of the original and expansion cards together will make it hard to get your color flights assembled, and when the purple dragons are out on the table it's hard not to think that there's a mortal sitting there instead (or vice versa).

Adds a lot of new interesting cards/effects to the original, allowing you to create some very weird/fun mixed decks that create more than 1 new tactics for play. Good addition to already decent game.

RATING: 9
A little bit of a random game in what cards you draw but immensely fun and simple card game where you are trying to make the biggest flight of dragons but if you play a lower or equal value card then you get to use the ability of the card. 1 Play.

Not great with 2 players, and mostly luck-based. I can imagine this would be a fun game if there was money on the table. Played it with 4 players and it was a little better. Will keep in my collection as it is easy to teach newbies and simple enough to appeal to older family members.

I was excited to see another edition of the game released. There are some slight differences and some of them are fun, but it just isn't the same as the original for me. However I'll always grab this one first because I want the original to stay in good condition.

I love that this feels like something the D&D heroes would play in-game... then again, that's exactly what this is.  There are even rules to give yourself bonuses based on your D&D character's skills (3rd edition rules).  Feels kinda like a D&D poker.

This is a D&D based card game that’s half poker and half strategic card game. While there’s some luck to it, the strategy changes with the number of players and which cards get played.

RATING: 6
Using actual bets, and with the right crowd I'd give it an 8, can be loads of chaotic fun when the circumstances are right. Doesn't really work with two, the steal-from-the-stakes-or-other-players -effects become too weak, so the game can deteriorate into a tug of war that can drag on forever. The more the merrier. A bit long to work as a filler, it's again one of those games I'd like to play "the right way" more than I have a chance to.

RATING: 6
Great way to get people into the idea of a card game, since anyone who has played with a deck of cards before easily understands the concepts, and it's fun to gamble with the campaign currency coins.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.2
Okay "trick-taking with special card abilities" game.
Issues:
- card colors are too similar (they are great in the original Three-Dragon Ante)
- can drag too long because many card abilities make you get or lose cards (get cards from the player who has the most cards)
- once you start to know the cards it seems not that much game remains - you are always facing easy and not that interesting choices.
- luck level in buying cards (with a price that can go from 1 to 13) is just too much for my taste.
Still, it looks good, has an okay mechanism and plays fine.

RATING: 7
This is a simple game where card powers only fire if you play card that is equal to or less than the card previously played.  Game starts by putting a card in the ante and highest number is what all players pay to the ante.  You typically play three cards and highest value wins the pot.  But there are plenty of ways to "steal" from the pot with evil dragons and get more cards with good dragons.  

It can be combined with the base Three Dragon Ante game to make a super deck or you can play standalone.  The game has a little more balance than the base game.

Glad I have the update...however, my gaming group didn`t like this at all...one called it too abstract, and a type of magic the gathering-esk clone.Another who won most games was just stunningly bored by it all. myself..I like it..I like some of the chaos of it..especially the ante cards, but in the end I can`t see this being asked for again at the group meet. A pity for me but as they say..win some, lose some.

A fairly simple betting game, though the gambits can get fairly complex as your hand ties over throughout each gambit, and many ante abilities and power abilities can trigger to complicate a gambit. I enjoy the game, especially for its theme.

RATING: 6.5
A fun, if somewhat convoluted, gambling/trick taking game.  The D&D theme is largely tacked on, but it helps to make a mediocre game into something worth breaking out every once in a while.  The art is cool, but minimalist.  Not terrible, just not as good as it could be.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Much like the original game, but with some good and bad.  The ante-effects and cards that allow cards to be added or removed from the ante are a great addition and make the game considerably more interesting.  However, the new dragons and their cards are too similar in color, making them difficult to distinguish across the table.  I also preferred the art in the first game better, but I think that's a matter of personal taste.

Some interesting ideas here with the ante, ante effects, and how the highest card gives first play of the next round, but lower card allows you to use text ability. Plus a built-in incentive to never deplete your hand. But it is still a game where you see what cards you have and optimize each play in a trivial, hope-you-don't-have-X manner.

Also, this is a betting game (D&D's version of poker?), but the stakes are also determined by what cards you have (instead of any amount of your wealth that you name), which makes it a little unsatisfying.

Greatly increases the replayability of Three-Dragon-Ante. You can actually buy this as a stand alone game, in which case it is equal to the original, but if you combine the two it exponentially increases the fun as you can customize your deck to create several different experiences.

RATING: 7
Just as good as the original game, but there's a few problems with the production. The cards are flimsier than those from the first game (which is strange and disappointing) and the "fade" on the backs of the cards wasn't done correctly, so it is easy to pick out which set the card is from when cards are mixed. On the positive side, the box is better than the original.

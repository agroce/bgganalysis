RATING: 7
Weirdly, the Shut Up / Sit Down cards (that I identified) were the strangest and hardest. Otherwise, a solid mix of humorous cards. Interesting balance of cards that are easier/harder in early rounds, then vice versa in later rounds.

Yes! Monikers was great already. This just provides cards that are more culturally relevant to my group. The writing on the cards is top notch as youâ€™d expect from the funny team at SUSD.

Extremely random but good for some laughs. It's fun and annoying at the same time.

It's simple fun. Laughter is guaranteed the last rounds and it's all due to funny things your friends have said, not some forced "funny" jokes in the game. The cards themselves are very funny though.

Kickstarted in 2017.

Some great additions, my only gripe with this is that I can't see any markings on the card to determine if a card is from the base set or the SU&SD set.

Adds more cards. You can even play Monikers using these cards. Doesn't require the base. Think of it as a smaller deck of cards.

This deck though is a bit more special. Designed by the silly folks at SUSD.

More cards for Monikers it great, however, many of these are absurdly difficult to remember/say exactly, which is intentional and funny, but is kind of annoying.

I love Time's Up and I like Monikers, but I mostly didn't care for the cards in this particular box.  They may just not be my thing.  I still had a blast playing because Time's Up is such a strong base, but I wouldn't choose to play this box again.

Now this expansion you can play with everyone. I like how they are a little more random than the main games' if you can believe it.

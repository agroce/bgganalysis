Very light traditional card game, with a quirky theme and components. It plays quickly, is easy to explain, and has more decisions involved than it appears from an initial glance at the rules. It's not very deep, but it is amusing.

A pretty neat trick-taking game.  The rounds have an interesting flow to them and the decisions are nice little puzzles.  The player elimination is kinda rough, though.

RATING: 9
Some people say there's not much to this game but you can't just play the highest card every time or you'll be forced to lose your low cards and lose on the last trick which you DON'T want to win! ON some of the hands you want to play the middle cards eve though you have high cards in your hand. Anyway, I think it's really a fun little game and I love playing it. Wish they'd make an app for it.

we've started the game with 7 players and the first few rounds it seemed a pure luck based game. After the elimination of the first players tactics and gamefun raised. When only 3 players left, a complete different game started. Much better then it seemed in the beginning.

Five Cucumbers Version

I generally really like trick taking games, which this is. Albeit one with just a single suit and some lovely wooden cucumbers. This is a trick taking game about not winning the last trick. You either have to play a card that's higher then the last played or discard your lowest card. The "winner" of the last trick receives a number of cucumber meeples equal to the number on the card they won the trick with, a number between 1 and 5 with a double card. Once you get five cucumbers your eliminated from the game. Overall I found this to be very predictable, while its not a bad game its also not a good one.

Seriously who does player elimination in a trick taker!

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting trick taking game. Again, not for two players. Please stop putting that player count on the box if your game is terrible when played that way.

RATING: 8
Rated as a family game.  This was THE hit of the 2015 holiday season with the family.  Super simple rules plus cute pickle tokens.  Building tension as you get near the final, decisive trick.  Yes, there is a lot of luck, but there is some strategy (at least as much as your typical family card game).  One thing I like is that both high cards and low cards are good; it's only the middle-range cards that are bad.  So there are fewer hopeless hands in this game than in a card game where only high cards are good.  One nice thing:  it plays 2-6 players well; my wife and I played a two player game on a train ride for a couple of hours. Player elimination is the main downside of the game, but we spiced things up by forcing an eliminated player to wear a green balaclava until the next player was eliminated.  Hilarious!  We called the person with the hat "The Gherkin."  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
I'd hesitate to really call it a trick taking game, but Funf Gurken is a fun little game that involves tricks.  You'll use the tricks to hopefully cull high cards from your hand, as the only thing that matters is avoiding the final trick.  None of the other tricks matter, other than trying to ensure you have a small card remaining for the final trick!

Overall, a light, but neat little card game.

Very light game. Wish it had a bit more strategy. I really like the cucumber meeples - this would probably be a level less if it didn't have that) + its compact size. Doesn't really play well with two people but it does have very simple rules to explain to a larger group.

Keep in mind...  this is a 40-year-old traditional card game, republished with revised cucumber scoring.   It is not a gamer's game.  Not even close.   Simple trick taking, with just one suit and the tricks don't matter.   Except you don't want the last one.  Players are eliminated and it whittles down to a duel.   Maybe that part of the game lasts too long.  You can't work your way out of a bad hand, since many of the cards aren't dealt out.   You're stuck with it.   So there are some problems, but it is definitely the kind of card game you can play with non-gamers and extended family, and in that niche it functions just fine.  You could play with 6 or even 8 players, so that gives it some flexibility over Hearts or Spades, perhaps.  The main crux of the strategy revolves around keeping a bunch of high cards and one really low one.

Very simple trick-taking game where only the final trick of a hand counts. Rounds can be quite interesting if cards are reasonably well distributed. With a bad hand of all middling cards, however, the game plays itself and since it features player elimination you may not just be out for that one hand but forever. There are much better trick-takers around.

RATING: 7
Five Cucumbers is a feather-light trick-taker that is easy, breezy, and beautiful. As you can only play to win a trick (by matching or playing higher) OR playing your lowest card, there isn't a lot of depth, but there's just enough depth for quick-and-dirty card fishing/baiting, stakes raising, and hard bluffs. Simple and fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 2.5
Trick taking game with player elimination that is void of strategy. Tedious exercise that is only based on luck of the draw. Strategy is simple, dump high cards. Player to take last trick takes cucumbers, more than 5 cucumbers leads to elimination. Player elimination just prolongs a very dull game. Lesson here, if a 12 dollar game is half price, don't be duped.

Hmm...  I don't quite know what to think about Five Cucumbers.  I love trick-takers and I understand that several card games seldom give players much choice in what to play.  However, in Five Cucumbers, I almost feel as if I have no choice.  Now that being said, there's something enjoyable about the game that I just can't put my finger on.  I wouldn't really see this as one I would suggest for play (there's so many better trick-takers out there), but if a group of folks wanted to play, I don't think I would turn it down.  So yeah, it's not much of a game, but it's not a bad activity.

Friedemann's small package efforts have a serious potential to annoy me. In so far I wasn't surprised when I learned afterwards that this is rather a re-working of a classic Baltic trick-taker and not his own idea as I found this game just plain average and fine as a passtime.
It's a trick-taking variant on the last-man-standing principle used so successfully by Love Letter. But it's too long and some hands are just too unplayable to justify playing it instead of the former or another better trick-taking game.

Light trick-taking games like this are fun and those little green cucumbers are a nice touch.  Gameplay is interesting enough.  However, with 4-5 players, the game can take longer than what most would like.  It overstays its welcome.  Player elimination is a factor too, so if you don't like player elimination then consider something else.  We had one person go out after 2 rounds and they had to sit through the rest of the game which was about 15-20 minutes.

RATING: 6
A streamlined version of a traditional scandinavian trick taking game with an interesting twist: out of the seven tricks that make up a round, only the last one will actually count for anything, and you try to lose that one. Everything that happens before is just to prepare yourself for the showdown of the seventh trick.

Contrary to the opinion of many commenters, this allows for quite a bit of strategic play and, perhaps more importantly, misplay. What relegates it to a pleasant social activity instead of a proper gamer’s game is the unfortunate aspect of player elimination, which is fine if you’re primarily interested in having something to do with your hands while chatting with friends, but a big hindrance if gaming is supposed to be the main attraction. Bring it to the pub or a barbecue, but leave it at home for game night.

Not a terrible card game.  Played it at 4:15 in the morning while waiting for the 2013 BGG.Con.  From what I can remember, after 4 days of gaming, was that you played your cards to get rid of them in a pseudo trick-taking game.  At the end, whoever had cards left over received a pickle.  The first to five pickles loses.

A simple trick-taking game that at first seemed pretty random. The player who takes the last trick takes penalty points (cucumbers shown on the cards of that trick) and you play until all but one player has been eliminated (having taken 5 cucumbers).

Played this just the once at an open gaming day and was thoroughly impressed. A great filler with a little bit of depth and player elimination! The game is basically a trick taking game where the key thing is not to win the seventh and final trick of each hand. The loser picks up the number of gherkins on the card they play, when some-one acquires five (or more) gherkins they are eliminated.

This game plays really well and is a complete hoot. I anticipate that it will go over well with my lunchtime games group. Will consider purchasing in the future. Highly recommended.

Everything seems really intriguing, but there's no strategy here.  There is no reason to hang on to your high value cards. If everyone plays this way, card values will meet each other in the middle by the time the last trick comes around.  After that, it's just luck and turn order that will determine the winner of the final trick. You can play this game in your sleep (because it will put you to sleep).

Not terrible, but not particularly innovative, either.  Trick taking game, seven cards per player, must play equal or higher than highest played card or your lowest card.  Last trick determines how many pickle meeples you take.  That's pretty much it.  Not much strategy.  Kind of plays itself.  Has player elimination, though, which never works well.  Sort of a let down from FF.

Fünf Gurken is a very simple trick-taking/climbing game based on a Scandinavian traditional-deck game. Not a huge amount of decisions to be made but damn it was fun.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
Not sure that a trick-taker can be simpler than this, as this game contains only one suit. The basic gist is that on your turn you can either play a higher card than what's led, or else your lowest. The goal is that you do not want to win the last trick, so people end up trying to position themselves to win the second to last trick and have a very low card for the final trick. Each card has a certain number of cucumbers printed on it, and the winner of the last trick has to take the corresponding number of cucumber meeples as a punishment. As players accumulate 5 cucumbers, they are eliminated. It works perfectly well as a 2p trick-taker since all games eventually become 2p games anyway. 

The key takeaway here is that this is very, very light. Good for an intro to trick-takers, or good for a few minutes of card tossing, maybe over a drink. 

Evidently based on a traditional game called Cucumber. One of these days I'll try that one, just to say I have. 

EDIT: I am adding an updated comment now because I have just seen the umpteenth forum dismissal about this game where someone says the game is broken because you can "always play your highest card." No, no, no, [i]no[/i]. You either play a higher card than what came before you (which can actually be the same value), or else you play your lowest. That's it. That's the choice. If the highest card in your hand is not higher than the card played right before you, [i]then you can't play it.[/i] If someone leads a 9 and you have a 6 and a 2 remaining in your hand, you can't play the 6. You have to play the 2. 

This is by no means a deep, rewarding trick taker. But it also is not automatic -- I cannot help but feel that the claims that it is automatic are because people are slightly getting the rules wrong. Why on earth would I play a 12 on the first trick simply because it's my highest card? Why would I get rid of it early and risk that my second-highest card (a 10, say) still stands up during the second-to-last trick? Remember, the rules state you can follow a ten with another ten and the second ten becomes the high card. It is a light, breezy, fun game that offers a rough introduction to sequencing your cards as you figure out what you'd prefer to use in the last two tricks, and then you try to get yourself there. It might be limited, but it is [i]not[/i] mindless and automatic.

I like the idea of a trick taking game entirely centered around losing the 7th trick.  But the mechanics used here to achieve that leave me wanting.  There are no suits, so few cards in circulation that there is no card counting, and few few opportunities to choose how you follow.  How you lead is a neat choice, but following is almost entirely scripted leading to long periods of non-agency.  Much of the game is dictated by what cards you are dealt and there isn't much opportunity to 'play a bad hand well'.  Also, there is player elimination.

That's all too bad, since the core concept had a lot of promise.

--Nov2017-- It's quite cute.  But there are rather fewer decisions available to the players than I might prefer.

I'm a sucker for trick-taking games, but this one fell flat for me.  It's just okay. Game play is either play your highest card to win the trick or your very lowest, don't take the last trick or you get some number of cucumbers, if you get 5 or more cucumbers the you're out.  There really aren't many real strategic decisions to be made, so the game mostly plays itself.  I like the theme though and would play it as a quick filler from time to time if I owned a copy. It's a good game to play while having a conversion.

Ok trick taking game. Relatively obvious decisions and relatively few of them. Not a bad filler by any means, but also not something I get excited about. I would rather play 6 Nimmt, or 23 or Dalmuti or many other games.

1 play, 6er

NOT good with 6! You are almost totally at the mercy of the card draw, with very little you can do to affect your outcome. Just hope that someone leads a card that allows you to play something you want to play!

[b]--- Summary ---[/b]
The deck has6 60 cards: 1-15 x 4 (no suits). Each card has 1-4 pickles pictured on it, or a "2x". Deal 7 cards/player. Dealer leads a card at start. On your turn, you must either play a card higher than any in the trick (for duplicates, later plays are higher) or your lowest card. Highest card leads next trick. The only trick that matters is the final one: whoever wins it also takes pickles tokens as pictured on their winning card. 5 pickles and you're knocked out; last remaining player wins!

My gaming group said: A boring game !
Very often you can not even choose which card to play, you MUST play a special one. It took too long for the people who where already out of the game (dead) and had to wait for the end.
I wouldn´t buy it again.

[Stronghold Games 2017 edition] {Fruit; trick-taking, player elimintation; optimal 6p} A cute trick-taking filler, in which you need to avoid winning the last trick.

With fewer players too many cards are used.  It's difficult to count cards.  Luck is more important.  High cards are clearly punishing, and there are few ways to get rid of high cards without taking a trick.  Thus, when you are dealt with a hand of 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 14, 14, and 14,  Good luck to you!  So, this game is quite luck driven; everyone is rushing to play their high cards as soon as possible (so sometimes, it's not really wise to lead your highest card so that other people can escape their high card easily.)

- No suit in this game.

Trick taking, where only the last trick of a round is significant for scoring. Whoever wins that last trick takes some pain points (the higher their winning card, the more pain points). Get too many points and you're eliminated, and the last survivor wins.

Enjoyed this a lot.

Mmyeah, what to say? This game works, kind of. There's nothing really wrong with it, but I didn't find it great. It doesn't do anything we haven't seen before. And the luck factor is quite significant. Of course, this is just a light filler so we shouldn't expect too much. But if I compare this to the similar and recent [thing=153065][/thing], that game doesn't do anything new or spectacular either, but it just works so much better. I don't see myself refusing to play this, but I see no reason to request it either.

Initial rating: 5/10

We had a lot of laughs playing this, but I suspect that is overwhelmingly because of the company rather than the game itself. In far too many hands there were little to no decisions to be made. Watching other people play hands, it was apparent that almost everyone chose the same card in almost every situation.

Egy jó kis kártyajáték, valahol a makaó és a snapszer között. Nem annyira "nehéz" és "gondolkodós" mint a snapszer, de kicsit jobb, mint a makaó. Akik szeretik a kártyát és szeretik azokat a játékokat, amelyekből jó párat le lehet játszani egymás után, azok ezt is szeretni fogják. Sörözés, kártya, beszélgetés, nevetés, szóval ebbe a kontextusba való.

A hátránya, hogy ki lehet esni, azaz minden parti arról szól, hogy elkezdik x-en és addig tart a játék amíg már csak ketten vannak.A többieknek addig várniuk kell.

L'explication des règles ne laissent pas voir les subtilités du jeu. Mais malgré cette subtilité, la stratégie est assez limitée par notre main de cartes.

Intéressant, mais pas un jeu qu'on voudra jouer très souvent.

(Too) simple & random trick-taking game. Based on a traditional card game; pretty pointless.

Fast and random filler, but with enough tactics that you can make some clever plays. With two, it becomes much more strategic, but still very quick.

I bought this as one of those games you keep as a bit of a gag - like your personal 'hidden secret' that no-one else has (and for good reason) but... that kinda backfired as for a very silly little, quick, simple to teach and play trick taking game, this game is truly awesome. It's stupid, highly themed - except for seemingly no reason WHATSOEVER! Somewhere in Fridemann Friese's brain the idea of Gherkins just made sense - who are we to argue. The tokens are awesome, though I feel the box lid should feature sandwich loaf artwork. Brilliant and dirt cheap.

I'm intrigued by this game because there seems to be a subtlety to the card play that currently eludes me (it starts out feeling like it's rather mindless, but as the game progresses, you start to see that there are definitely decisions to make on how to manage your hand), but I'm not wild about the player elimination aspect to it.  The first player out in a five-player game might be watching for a long time, since taking the last trick isn't an insta-out.  Part of me does want to play it again, to see if what's left in the game is worth the elimination aspect of it.

Some games of 2F-Spiele are great (i.e. Power Grid, Friday), some are just nice (i.e. Fürstenfeld) and others are nothing special (i.e. Fiji). Because of the first category, we’re always interested in what new games 2F-Spiele shows in Essen. We noticed a small cardgame between them, and we became, also because of the nice price, interested in this one. On Sunday we found the only table this was played on available, and we decided to give it a try. The game was explained to us, and just as we wanted to start playing, 4 other people wanted to join the game. We agreed, and it was explained again. The other four players were very annoying, as one of them was cheating. Another one, didn’t like the game, and wasn’t planning on hiding that for the other players. Another player continuously said, that he was in a hurry. After one round, the four other players decided to leave. We were glad that they did, as it was not a great experience for us, and we already found out, that this was a game that fitted in the second category mentioned (just nice). As said in the description on BGG (quoted above), it’s all about not winning the last trick of the round. And sometimes it’s a hard task to fulfill. This one plays nice with two. I even think, this one plays better with two, because the more players there are, the easier it is to count cards. A nice addition to our collection.

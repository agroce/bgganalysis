Excellent tactical WarGame.  Probably the best tactical WarGame ever made.  Rules can be a bit daunting at first, but most players fall easily into the rules after the first couple of games.

RATING: 7
This is a hard one to assess, because there's so much of it.  My experience of it is limited.  However, I'd say that it has great detail and can be very challenging to play.  The rules are on the light side of the complicated bracket.  Sometimes they can be a bit much, but they do cover for every eventuality - like sewer movement and beserk Russian units.  A lot of it is about keeping your leaders healthy, and morale checks form the biggest aspect of the game.  It's obviously a good game, and I can see why lots of folks would give it a 9 or 10, but, wargame-lover though I am, I tend to prefer games with slightly less rules.

And so it begins... It also a good place to stop, but of course I didn't ;)

The barbie doll of wargaming. Buy it once, then keep on buying it: expansions, scenarios, official and third party. And then there's ASL.

Rated 8 for nostalgia. Now the only game in the extended SL/ASL series that I still own.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
An incredibly important game in wargame design.  But also a gloriously unfolding mess as far as rules go; after Cross of Iron, things did get rather out of hand.  One solution would be to head off into the world of Advanced Squad Leader, another would be to go off and explore the highly addictive Combat Mission series of computer sims.  But there's still nothing at all wrong with a game of SL+COI+(selected) COD rules.

RATING: 10
The initial game that got me hooked to wargames. The system is slightly dated, but no other tactical ww2 game has even come close to this game system, much less it's newer cousin ASL.

If there were no strater kits for ASL, than this is the game to use to initiate those newbies into the SL family.

AN excellent game system that brings hundreds of scenarios to play in a short evenings' time.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
I'm sure this was revolutionary at the time but the killstacks, deadly randomness of the IFT and absurdly powerful defensive fire really killed this one for me. It's a shame, I was hoping to enjoy it and maybe pick up a copy on ebay. 

I think it could be good with a couple of revisions, which I guess is why I see some of the changes in ASL. I like the basic concepts and the sequence of play but the above stuff is so anathema to a positive play experience for me that it knocks the rating way down.

update: I really cannot stress enough how vastly superior the IFT is in ASL, and how much even a little tweak like one attacker self rally improves the game.

Flaw in the gem:
Micro-tactical scale that nevertheless does not account for individuals within the squads, as "Tobruk" does. AH chose to abandon the 'Tobruk' system in favor of SL/ASL: fair enough, but once you've tasted "Tobruk", you'll always miss it's elegance, to which the pin/unpin rules here just never compare.

Si hubiera querido pasar estudiando el resto de mi vida, hubiera opositado.

Reglamento infernal, estética muy superada y mecánicas ya un poco anticuadas. No consiguió engancharme en absoluto en mi juventud a la serie.

ASL no lo toco ni con un palo.

This game is more fun than I expected it to be.  I still prefer Tide of Iron for actually playing games with other people, but for sitting down and seeing how a WWII firefight might play out SL can't be beat.  If you're a WWII history nut like me, do yourself a huge favor and pick this game up on eBay.  I've mostly played solitaire but the tactical decisions I make stick in my head for days. You basically get to watch a war movie unfold in front of you on the tabletop. A true classic!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Perhaps the best WWII tactical wargame.  Game play is a balance between playability and simulation.  Each expansion adds more details and rules and rules and rules.  The extensive growth of rules is likely the biggest drawback to the game.  If the complexity doesn't kill your interest and you enoy tactical games, this is a top wargame.  [GTI Code: TPSD]

Had only a few games of SL before being seduced by ASL. Like the programmed approach of these rules though and system nowhere near as heavy. Difficult to play SL after learning ASL as there would be quite a few rules that would need 'unlearning'.

The rulebook contained some pretty good designer notes, an LOS training course and a campaign game mechnism, so even if you play ASL it's still worth picking up a copy, particuarly if it contains boards 1-4.

8/21/16: The progenitor of ASL.  While the base game is good, it suffers from the issue of evolving rules and counters with the expansions.  The upside is that when ASL came out, its rules were pretty solid.  Squad Leader was good in its day, but I can't see ever playing this again once the ASL Starter Kits released.

Cross referencing charts and rules amidst strategic, squad level planning is right up the alley for myself and my computer-programmer opponent.  He and I are always amazed how close to history each played scenario comes out no matter the seeming randomness of our rolls, attesting to superior game testing.  A very fun and engaging simulation.

Given regular, face to face playing, I can see how this would turn into a habit.  If you like tactical WWII combat, this is your game.

Lost more squads that way....

Greatest war game of all time hands down. Complex to the "T's". Dont paly much any more as this game needs lots of time to study to get good with the rules. Beautiful, fun and so educational. It has really taught me a bunch about WWII. ASL took this great game to even greater heights with streamlined rules. Everything is beautiful in these sets. I have moved over to Combat Missions (the ASL adaptation)as the computer makes easier gamplay for me. I dont need to do as much record keeping or rule analysis so I can play more. I still love to just look at my rules and counters.....I did not give this game a 10 because ASL (Advanced Squad Leader) perfected it.

Since I am a tactical WWII gamer, I am a little confused as to why I don't love SL.  Perhaps my earlier introduction to one counter, one man games (Patrol, Sniper, Ambush) gave me a preference for that scale.  I purchased all the original SL games some time ago, but have only played a few scenarios.  ASL is far too daunting, both in time and money required, to ever get my attention.  The excellent Combat Mission series of computer games has filled the SL level simulation niche for me recently, and I might be persuaded to give the boardgame another chance...the morale and leadership rules seem a little off for so detailed a game, but the subject matter may pull me in yet.

I am quite sure Squad Leader is a great game. The components are very well done and the map boards are great. I liked the basic scenarios but the detail and the complexity of the higher scenarios just got to be TOO MUCH. I found myself spending more time studying the rules than actually playing the game. I can not even fathom Advanced Squad Leader. 
This is where I drew the line between complexity and playability. I tend to prefer games with a lower complexity rating.

One of the first wargames I ever bought. When I saw the size of the rules I thought,  arrgh. However I did persist and fought my way through the first few scenarios. Wow, opened my eyes to a whole new world of hexes and stacks and stuff! I still have the game and would recommend it highly, which is not to say the other tactical squad level games don't also do a great job. I know nostalgia can blind one to a games defects, SL isn't perfect but it has stood the test of time which shows what a smashing job the developer did and how this spawned similar systems going strong today.

Getting back into it.  One of the first games that I owned and never really got too far with it.  Now, after having another try, I really like it.  I spent a fair bit of time assessing whether I should just move up to ASL and join the fanatical hordes, but that system just overwhelmed me - not so much due to the rule complexity, but the quantity of items needed to round out the experience.  So, I have opted to stay entrenched in SL and all of the gamettes.

Definetly the game on tactical combat.  Cutting edge back in the day.  Used to play it a lot; one of my first serious wargames.  Now, the tactical nature does not appeal to me.  My collection consists of mainly strategic/operational games.

I guess, I'd rate this higher, but I've never had a good game to be honest. The people who play it around here are middle aged, and take the game MUCH too seriously. So I've never gotten in any good learning games. Nice deep game, if that's your cup of tea.

RATING: N/A
For its time the game was revolutionary. I still remember playing the scenario "Street of Stalingrad" and being totally wowed. Then the system got out of control...like big time out of control.  ASL came, and with it too many rules, exceptions, and modifiers. Yet with all the talk about realism there were still no command control rules at all.  This version is fun and worth playing.  ASL is merely squad combat for the OCD/statistics crowd.

RATING: 8
Not sure about some of the complaints about complexity; SL is not an easy game, but on the scale of modern wargames it&#039;s pretty straightforward. I think I can recommend the basic SL without reservation; it&#039;s a very fun game. Things then slowly got out of hand: Cross of Iron was worth the effort for the variety of vehicles and the whole Eastern Front thing, which was always SL&#039;s strength. Crescendo of Doom should probably be avoided, as this is where the rules started becoming gratuitious and pointless, and the treatment of the French &amp; minors isn&#039;t great. GI: Anvil of Victory is a waste of time; just go to ASL instead. It&#039;s sad you can&#039;t play the Americans outside of the basic game; if Cross of Iron had a few US vehicles, I would have bene happy. But, the basic game is where it&#039;s at anyway.

I rate this this low only because I'd much rather play Combat Mission or some other PC game on this topic.  SL is an excellent, deservedly famous game.  I currently have a nice 4th edition copy.  Although I generally don't favor tactical games, I have good memories of playing this one.  You always feel like a real wargamer when you win a game of SL.  Combat Mission is way more immersive though.  Decided I like Combat Commander better.

I prefer my counter in CoD to the one in ASL.

This is a very clever system in the hands of John Hill, less so in the hands of his Merry Elves in later modules, but I regard it as a buffet from which to take that which I like.

At the time, a stunning looking game and still holds up well. Some great mechanics in there and provides a really effective narrative 'feel' for small unit combat. If I was stuck on a Desert Island and had to take one game, this would be it!

RATING: 7
A classic wargame.  Played it a decent number of times, mostly solitaire.  This was a "10 on the 1-10 complexity scale" Avalon Hill game, along with Third Reich.  Those were the days.  Wargames today have become so complex that this game seems simple in comparison with its programmed learning system. 

Ultimately I'm just not a tactical guy, LOS rules always bug me and are always hard to play.

This was probably a 10 for me back in the day, but today, well I'll give it a 7 out of respect for how groundbreaking it was in modeling soft factors.  The scale/weapon range etc are all totally fictional, so a simulation it's not, despite the detail. Unit control of course is also highly unrealistic, but that's true of virtually every wargame.

Squad Leader is an enjoyable tactical wargame.  I was a little daunted when I tried to parse the rules for the Advanced Squad Leader Starter Kit #1, but the programmed nature of Squad Leader is very well done.  Seven pages of rules and you're up and going on the first scenario.  If you're trying to get into ASL, this might be a good place.  I enjoy Combat Commander a bit more than Squad Leader, but if you can pick up Squad Leader on the cheap, it's probably worth it.

My taste in games has been moving on since 2007. The bottom line is I am no longer enthusiatic about playing longer or unexceptional wargames.   I have downgraded most of my rating inline with this.  The comments reflect my opinion of the games but I have rated the games lower in line with BGG guidance since I am unlikely to be playing them again.

Programmed instruction and intuitive system makes up for dense and lengthy rulebook. As for the critics, I never understood what was supposed to be wrong with "design for effect." In this sytem, it reduces the tedium and introduces uncertainty to the outcome, kind of like what happens in real life at the tactical level. So while the game may not be literally realistic at the minutia level, overall it conveys a realistic result.

Components - mostly punched, played a couple times.  Complete except two leaders went missing (Sgt. Allen & Com. Dottski) for which replacements have been made.  Rulebook has been paged through - light soiling along spine and edges but it is free of any writing/highlighting.
Box - the box is intact, no splits.  There is general soiling/scuffing from 30+ years of being handled/moved.

I'm intrigued with Squad Leader, but I'm not too sure this is the game for me.  My first game was fun (scenario 1); I was the Russians and was able to kill a lot of Germans.  However, I never felt that I had the LOS or the movement nuances down, so I wasn't really sure if I was playing effectively.  Also, the morale mechanic seems quite severe.  I would probably give this another try, but I think I would prefer something a little larger scale.

Where Panzerleader was the introduction to advanced army men simulations Squad Leader was the bible.

A friend got this for Christmas a year after I had started playing Panzer Leader and it was like "Oh, what's this?"

"I don't know. Let's give it a try" came the reply.

Everything in my life after that moment just became a blur of Squad Leader madness. I had the Uber Bookcase mounted 3-Pack for Squad Leader.  This Sleeve mounted set included Squad Leader, CoI, and CoD.  Pure gaming goodness packaged fresh in a box! 

While my tastes have shifted over the years, it is still fair to say that this was the game that defined those aspects of a shared group gaming experience that I most enjoyed then about war-gaming as a hobby.

From the moment I picked up the box in a shop in Glasgow I knew I would love this game.  Opening the box at home I was not disappointed and have had endless hours of gaming satisfaction from SL and it's 3 offspring.

Must be a candidate for best game of all time.

A fun game of small unit tactics that has really withstood the test of time. The game play is very simple and logical - follow the sequence of play. Just decide who is doing covering fire and who is moving, the rest is on autopilot. The dice swing wildly yes, but you make an awful lot decisions and roll an awful lot of dice so things will even out in the long haul.

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
The box comes with 4 hard-board hex-grid maps and a ton of counters and markers for the use of the German, Soviet and American forces. The boards can be connected horizontally or vertically giving a variety of maps. Each hex is 40m so; the detail for movement and fighting is high. It has 12 scenarios, portraying 6 historical fighting situations between German and Soviet troops and 6 more between German and US troops. The rules booklet is thick and dense but this should not scare away newcomers to the hobby. The rules are progressively getting detailed and harder. So, one reads the first pages of the booklet and in a short time is ready to set-up and play the first scenario. After being satisfied with the game he reads a couple more page-rules and is ready to advance to the second scenario and so on. Each infantry counter represents 10 men, a squad. The rest of the counters represent leaders, fighting vehicles, tanks, very many weapons, snipers, AT guns etc. Game play simulates accurately fighting tactics of WWII. You can even design your own scenarios. A must-have for any grognard. 

For more flavor and fighting situations you can add the following AH’s gametes: ‘Cross of Iron’, ‘Crescendo of Doom’ and ‘G.I. Anvil of victory’. Also, ‘The General’ magazine provides ton of scenarios. If after playing all these one wants more he has to go to the ‘Advanced Squad Leader’ series.

A great concept run amok.

I really didn't want to rate this game. I played this game a lot, and won a national tournament once, so it clearly stands out to this writer as a game worthy of the time spent. It can be incredibly fun to play. The campaign rules make it personal, like role playing. 10 for potential or for a discovery phase.

But it's so complicated and encumbered once add-ons are included, with all the special nationality rules, it gets to be a real drag. I never saw a scenario played without one of the guys keeping rulebooks literally in hand. Players studied the rules while the other player moved. Who knows how many students lost a full grade point because of this game.

The seemingly endless complexity wore me out and I do not own or play it any more. They just went too far with it.

The original. I used to play this with my dad when I was about 9 - so relied pretty heavily on his direction. This is the John Hill classic that has that balance between simplicity and realism. Yeah it's old. Yeah it uses counters and chits - but this is the granddaddy of wargames and I'm not sure that there are any tactical level games which are better. John Hill put a lot of thought into playability and keeping things simple and the rulesets really do make sense. The order of play in particular is one of the things that provide both realism and simplicity. Each hex represents 40m of ground and each turn 2 minutes time - so it is possible (if you know the rules backward) to do this in real time. Its also possible to know the rules backward unlike ASL which piles on the chrome so a lot of the play is spent consulting the rules. 
I'd just emerged from my gaming dark ages and asked my data whether he still had it. "Sure, I just listed it on gumtree (equivalent of craigslist) - you want it?" Sure did. Along with the Cross of Iron expansion (which adds the perfect balance between simplicity and chrome) and duplicates of all the map boards! Now I just need someone to play with.

2015-08-10 : So I had met Phil and learned about this strange new genre of games called wargames. I was a history buff and a gamer, so I dove in head first into this natural biotope. In those pre-internet days wargames from the USA were hard to acquire but Phil had this address of a little wargame store called "The Light Brigade" in a not-too-distant town (Sint-Niklaas).

The library had a big book with the street plans of every town and I drew a little map that would lead me from the train station to the shop. I had saved some money from summer jobs and one Saturday morning I took the train to that town. I was in grog heaven, though I hardly recognized any titles, as the only wargames I knew were those owned by Phil or those in ads from magazines he had.

So I knew Squad Leader from ads -  and I knew this was the hot game because an article in a magazine had said so - so I got it - must have cost an arm and a leg but I didn't care. Played it to tatters, mostly solo, but also with Phil.

The other great discovery was that the box contained the AH catalog of games - the one book I read more times in my life than anything else. I still pick it up on occasion and leaf through it.

I believe this is the most playable and realistic tactical WWII combat game ever.  Elegant system, simply and accurately captures the reactions of men under fire.

I think this game is actually superior to "Advanced Squad Leader" because it's much more playable.

Dominated my free time when it came out.  A great system design along with very good scenarios.  The IFT was a big innovation and improvement over the Panzerblitz style odds CRT.  The scale is zoomed in and intensely personal.  The defensive fire mechanics were revised and greatly improved in ASL/ASLSK.

Great World War 2 Tactical wargame.  Somewhat dated now that the Advanced Squad Leader Starter Kit #1 is out, but this is still a great game -- there's just not as much growth here as there is with Advanced Squad Leader.  The programmed instruction format is brilliant, making the game very digestible.  I love the scale -- squad level feels so intimate.  Avoid the expansions, though -- they bog the game down.  If you want that level of detail, go for ASL instead, probably via the Starter Kits.

RATING: 8.5
Best of the series, very good game.
Yet too many rules are continuously added as you go along.
First scenario is by far the most fun.
Tanks do not really 'fit'. Would give 9.2 for an infantry only  game. 
Bonus British infantry counters sheet included for trade.

I remember playing this on a rickety table after high school and being fascinated by all the scenarios.  The problem was I never became too proficient with the rules, and the game took so long that I never finished any of them, but I loved the pieces and the chits and the maps.  I bought the expansions I could afford and if I still owned it, I think I would play it now.  Unfortunately, I'm fairly certain my parents sold it at a yard sale somewhere in the past, and I don't want to pursue it now - too many expansions in ASL.  A rabbit hole too deep for my own pockets.

First played this as an 11 year old in 1977, and I loved it and ASL for many years. If other squad games didn't exist, I'm sure I'd still love this and rate it higher, but at this point, I prefer Conflict of Heroes for the more streamlined rules and the larger chits (how did I ever deal with stacks and stacks of tiny chits, lol?). But I give this classic a nod of appreciation for all that it spawned in the hobby, and fun for a nostalgia play every now and then.

I bought this in 1990. It had always been my ambition to play, but at the time I had no-one to play it with. 

I kept SL, bought the expansions, tried a few games solo but without a regular, invested opponent, I was in over my head. Still, despite having played very little of SL, it's the one game which has had most influence over defining my preferences. 

Highly unlikely that I'll ever play this again, or one of the three subsequent gamettes, but I'm keeping all of them for posterity's sake.

RATING: 8
Even though this venerable title has been supplanted with the three ADVANCED SQUAD LEADER STARTER KITS, here within one box is a game that covers everything those three ASLSKs do, albeit with only three nationalities and four boards.  Sure, a number of the scenarios are not the best, but the ones that are good really are great--and those who play this game can never forget them: THE GUARDS COUNTERATTACK, THE TRACTOR FACTORY, STREETS OF STALINGRAD, HEDGEHOG AT PIEPSK, HILL 621, BUCHOLZ STATION, and THE BITCHE SALIENT.  Even as unbalanced as THE ROAD TO WILTZ was, who could resist tinkering with it?  

Unlike PANZERBLITZ being superseded by newer games, nothing has really replaced the basic SQUAD LEADER set yet, even after 33 years!

I never make it past mission 4 when I try to learn these rules.  I'll try every couple years, starting from scratch and after HOURS and HOURS I'll get tired of it and move on to something less draining.  But, I do believe that this is one of the finest game systems ever designed.  I know, I know, you're gonna tell me ASL is better, but who can afford it?  Not me.  So, I'll settle for being baffled by the rules of the children's level version.

I like all the scenarios and the base rules are easier than you would imagine, but I could never really get as much playing time as I wanted.  I still look at the rules and maps and will play it again soon.  In all, I really like how it's a big sandbox to play in.  So many units and options...  I moved into ASL and am addicted to the system.   I have played quite a bit of Advanced Squad Leader but never spent much time playing the original version.  I still have the set which is fun to look at.

RATING: 8
The granddaddy of all squad-level games. I'd suggest using the 4th edition, the Cross of Iron and possibly the Crescendo of Doom expansions, which will produce a near complete tactical level game of World War II in about 40 (60 with CoD) pages of rules. It even works for miniatures. 

My only criticisms are that, even without discussing the other expansions or ASL, too much effort has been expended on too many decidedly minor features (I.E., sewer movement or reindeer pulled sledges) and far-flung squads conduct advances of robot-like precision through even the most impenetrable terrain. That is admittedly a problem with many -  or all - miniature systems, but just how realistic is it to expect numerous squads to march against widely spaced objective and all arrive exactly on time? I can see it perhaps if you are modeling an army over a period of weeks, but a squad over a period of hours? And they are out of radio contact to boot?

All-in-all, however, it's a sound tactical simulation and a classic.

This is one of my ALL TIME favorite games.  BRILLIANT DESIGN by John Hill.  I can't remember the last time a game struck me as being so amazing.

Simple in concept, not to heavy on rules, this original game had the right weight, flavor and feel of squad combat in WWII.  The rule book is not too daunting, in my opinion, and with a programmed instruction set, it is easy enough to read and get started in a short period of time.

Subsequent games add tons and tons of layers and rules, but if you want simplicity and elegance, stick with the original game and you simply can't go wrong.  I loved this game when it first came out and I still play it on occasion today. 

Best scenarios to play are #1, #2 and #3.

A long time ago, in a city way down south, a father ventured to introduce his son to wargaming with one of the preeminent squad level games by TAHGC, Squad Leader. Wow.

While the follow up titles are rife with problems and criticism, I harbor no bad memories of my fumbled attempts at grasping the rules. The board art, counters and action are imprinted on my mind...

I spent a lot of time with this as a child, mostly playing solo.  I wouldn't mind revisiting it someday.  Excellent, flavorful system, although the armor rules are not very good.  The balance of playability and realism is outstanding here. After this first box, the system would immediately descend into minutiae, beginning with the gamette expansions and continuing with ASL.

Excellent game. Played since I was a kid.  Complexity is high for most people and game moves at slow pace but real thinking game. I think most rules are intuitive.  Biggest criticism is dice needs are not balanced enough with firepower odds.  I have ASL but didn&#039;t like some of the rules that were dropped.  May get around to really playing that but I tend to only play short scenarios.

Nice introduction into serious wargaming.
Hard but fast paced it is defenetly fun, gives the perfect picture of the bloodbath that has occured in WWII combat even if not as detailed a simulation such as ASL.

UPDATE
Today this game shows its age. The IgoUgo sequence is clunky and breaks the game and the simulation value for me. Today I prefer a system where choices are intermixed with those of your adversary and there's no serious downtime. I prefer ATS over this anyday. My only gripe is that ATS has really no VASSAL support which is a pity, since I seldom can play it f2f.

People makes me laugh when they look at games like Arkham Horror, Sid Meier's Civilization (any), etc. and say "It's complicated!" I think they never saw what a REAL complicated game is...

Squad leader IS a REAL complicated game. When you have a rulebook that is written with fonts the size you encounter in a pocket size bible or dictionary... it means it's complicated!

Although, it might be complicated, but I prefer this game ten fold over games like Battle of the Five Armies for example. At least it was not made to make money on a work of art (e.g. The Hobbit) and it is much deeper and replayable than Battle of the Five armies.

I really loved this game.  I ALSO played 'Advanced' Squad Leader for two decades...  THIS game, the orginal game, is a MUCH better 'game' and was orginally designed for miniatures (gasp! I know you are stunned).

It has a very good balance of playability and detail.  "Advanced Squad Leader" buries the *FUN* of the game with "exceptions" that add nothing to the "realism" let alone the games enjoyment (also known as "ASL" this is an entirely different and nowhere-near dead game system now owned by MMP).

Squad Leader itself however is a winner, but be sure to get the first expansion (Cross of Iron) as it contains REQUIRED changes (mind this as it was in lieu of a second edition...that is how AH did it in the "old days")

Rating for nostalgia.

I never got beyond the "The Guards Counterattack" scenario. The rules up to that point were simply too much. After playing games where there is no set number of turns, this bothered me that a wargame would have only 10 turns! Further, it would take nearly 30 minutes to execute each turn, where the sequence of actions per turn was mind-boggling.

Still, I can appreciate that this was a watershed design, ground-breaking in every which way, and effectively captured the feel of squad-level combat.

John Hill's design for effect masterpiece, and a superb physical production.  Played quite a lot back in the day; I could not justify or even mentally accommodate the numbing complexity of later modules or the 'advanced' version, which are utter geekfests.  Want the realism these complex games purport (falsely) to offer?   Run about in the cold and wet with an 80lb bergen for a couple of hours; it's quicker, and more fun.

Another early days game for the serious gamer who was tired of Monopoly and Risk.  A great idea in that you controlled individual men in a squad as opposed to large armies.  You could hide between vehicles in the street, throw grenades in buildings, and even smoke grenades to cover your tracks.   Very fun if you have time to read the manual and learn the rules.

RATING: 8
Just have to correct some misperceptions. Squad Leader, by itself, is not that complicated a game as hex wargames go. The complexity is added in its expansions- Cross of Iron, Crescendo of Doom and GI: Anvil of Victory. You can very easily play with all the nations from the expansions without adding in all the additional rules. Some comments here talk about how complex this game is, but it appears they are referring to the game when played with all the expansions, or even its successor, Advanced Squad Leader (ASL, which is probably the most complex game ever made). Squad Leader is a blast to play, and stands very well on its own. Nor has it been rendered obsolete by ASL, at least no more than chess has been rendered obsolete by, say, Monopoly. Squad Leader is a classic still worth playing, and it still gives more "bang for the buck" than even the ASL Starter Kits.

Only just started playing. Plenty of dice rolls so luck plays its part but there is a fair amount of tactics and meaningful decisions.

For many years I craved this game (I cut my teath on Panzer Blitz) and so when I finally got it I had very high expectations.  I am generally impressed by the clean rules which seem to do a good job abstracting the battlefield, but overall I found that playing the game ground my brain into paste.  This was one of the games that made me realize that I am not really a war gamer after all.  Also, I have found in this game and in others that as soon as you introduce tanks into the squad level scale, games take on an unfortunate luck dependance.  The tanks are very powerful (as they should be) so when you lose one (usealy due to dice rolling) you are suddenly at a noticable disadvantage which often leads toward your doom.

RATING: 8
A great game with each scenario leading you through the mechanics of the rules. It becomes a monster by the time you get to the last instalment (GI anvil). It gets more rule bound and harder/slower to play the deeper you get. Easily overcome by simply ignoring rules introduced after the 'Cross of Iron' installment except when scenario dependant.

Heavy is the first, second and last name of this game. I have yet to play only simple infrantry scenarios and even they had a mind boggling number of rules. Still, that's where this game shines: I don't think it's possible to get any closer than this to true combat simulation.

Ultimate game of squad level combat during World War 2.  The rules are in a modular fashion.  You only learn some and then you play a scenario.  To be honest, I never played past the first few scenarios.  One day, when I have more time (maybe when I'm retired), I'd like to try more of these.  It can be tough to find a decent opponent though.

One of the very best of the entire board wargame genre.  It is elegantly designed, historically rigorous, and presents excellent flow of play once the basic rules are mastered.  The rules are introduced in increments, so players can learn as they play.  I spent many many hours back in the 80s playing this game.

How to rate this one... It's an excellent wargame, and the programmed instruction makes it easy to start new wargamers on. As you pile rules on however it gets too complicated for my taste. It seems you leave these things behind as you get older :-)

After seeing the hype on this and knowing how I like war games I bought it off ebay.  Counting the pieces and LOOKING at the rulebook stopped me dead in my tracks like a deer in the headlights even though I knew it was complex I had no idea.  Apparently the rules aren't as bad as they look or as bad as ASL so hopefully one day this will come out...

UPDATE: With all the 'playable' war games around these days I decided to trade this, also, I do have Up Front which is a fast game like 90 minutes but the big rule book is once again intimidating...

Shill balancing...this is a really good game, I actually think its better than ASL because it was more straightforward.

**NOSTALGIA RATING**

This was--and is--a classic.

It totally deserves its accolades from it's time and it still wins today as a tactical wargame of WW2. Is it ultra realistic? Nope. It's a game; and, one of the best selling wargames of all time.

It lives on in a much more complex game in Advanced Squad Leader (a system I'm currently to start investigating via ASL Starter Kit 2).

If you can dig up a copy of this (and then Cross of Iron--stop at Cross of Iron), do so. It's got programmed instructions and you learn a little bit more as you move through each scenario. This may sound limiting, but it's not as the scenarios are designed to be played with the full rules once you know them all.

I actually like the old bookshelf games and I kind of miss them. I like that they're coming a bit back with GMT and MMP publishing.

RATING: 7
For old time grognards, this is more of a way of life than a game. The basic set contained a series of scenarios which took you through the complexities (and boy were there complexities...) of the basic system while still being engrossing and fun. The system went completely Tonto with the detail contained in later releases....I see this as both the high point and the end point of old-school hex and counter wargaming. We shall not see its like again (at least, not in your local toy shop).

RATING: 9
A wargaming classic.  There were other tacsims, but this one caught fire and propelled the genre, esp. as its popularity led to ASL.  We mock the defensive fire and mg rules now, and the armor rules were very simplistic (esp. compared to the earlier AH effort, Tobruk), but this game packed a lot of detail into a playable package.  It stood out in its day and is still playable now. Geomorphic boards and unit weights allowed for plenty of roll-your-own scenarios.

On a personal level, Tobruk was my first favorite game, but this game surpassed it--urban or countryside fighting, more playable scale, and I loved the leadership and morale rules.  (Let's not even talk of Panzerblitz.)  For a year or two, this and Cross of Iron were pretty much the only wargames I played.

If a first sight of those now familiar city streets- at another table in the out-of-school games club back in the late 70s in my home town, was memorable; my first venture into that Guards counterattack- at the Edinburgh University wargames club freshers’ day in 1981, was a bolt from the blue which changed this former teenage tankie’s gaming life forever. A game which restored the poor bloody infantry to its role as the queen of the battlefield? Wow! [i]Squad Leader[/i] scratched the itch my youthful, tank-heavy microarmour games had only ultimately inflamed. I was instantly hooked, and soon an obsessive fan.

I could never play [i]Squad Leader[/i] itself again- [family=2303][i]Combat Commander[/i][/family] is my go-to game for ASL-lite, but John Hill’s original ‘Squaddie’ remains a towering landmark in the history of wargaming. 10/10 and no question about it. ;)

Pure fascination from the very beginning. The icons of the MGs, the mortars, the Squads, just mesmerized me. The whole "atmosphere" of the game was, and is, utter magic. I open the box, may be once a year, and the smell of the paper and the ink, just transports me to the eighties, when I bought the game. The Guards Counterattack...
The rating is just for all the joy that this, and ASL, has provided to me.

28.10.2009: I bought it many years ago, but I haven't played it except for a couple of solo test plays. I would love to play it some more. If I knew they would be played, I wouldn't hesitate to buy the ASL Starter Kits. This is a game that I really would like to play sometime, but I still haven't found anybody willing to try it. I suspect the rating would rise after a couple of real plays.

My favourite ever wargame. Like a breath of fresh air when it came out. At the time the vast majority of wargames were very similar to the Avalon Hill classisc, thism was just soo different. 

Then came the expansions. The first one was good, but then they started to add too much and it did not work so well.

After the third expansion it really needed to be revised. So was born Advanced Squad Leader. A game I admire a lot, but have never played much.

This was a VERY in-depth hex & counter game of Squad based combat of WWII.  I had gamer friends who worshipped this game & I played it when they wanted to.  Personally, I found the game WAY too complicated (the rule book was very thick, in small text & two column pages) but if you're into VERY detailed war games, then this one's for you.  Games could last for hours or days--depending on how big you wanted your scenerios to be.  One of the 1st games I ever had that had expansions.  I actually won a game once... ONCE!  Many tables & charts made it a little tedious.

This game survived the great Chantilly VA 2002 basement flood, while expansions COI, COD, and GIAOV drowned. 

I took a long hiatus from wargaming from 1988-2009 to raise a family and concentrate on career in USN, but before I did I was a huge SL fan. Missed out on the ASL thing, and haven't had the inclination yet to get in.

Interestingly, when I reopened SL for the first time after 25 years or so, I was struck by how small, flimsy, and uninteresting the units were. Glad to see that for the most part the quality of the pieces and graphics have improved with the latest generation of board games. Although the prices have gone way up...!

For what it is, the most enjoyable game I've ever played. The system is certainly showing its age and it has some idiosyncrasies (e.g., the Defensive Fire mechanics) but, although nostalgia is admittedly a factor in my rating, the fun factor has never diminished for me. The game that got me into wargaming upon discovering it as a kid; still playing through the magic of Vassal and the tireless efforts of the 10-3s at the SQLA.

If this wasn't the first game I owned (I think Civilization was), it immediately became my iconic game. I liked the game so much that I completely rewrote the rules in my own way so that I could explain it more easily to other players. I still have the game in its battered box, which has travelled with me from continent to continent, and is probably the oldest thing I have continuously owned. 

Now my collection of war games has grown to a completely unmanageable 35, but if I were to be told that I could only save one of them, Squad Leader would probably be the one.

With Up Front, no more memorized, optimal board positioning--much more realistic.

I first played Squad Leader as a teenager when I borrowed a copy from a friend of a friend for a few months.  About ten years later I finally got a copy of my own.

I still haven't had the chance to get beyond the first few scenarios, but this is everything I want from a tactical wargame with one minor, niggling exception.  SL's rules aren't as complex as they look in the rulebook, since the programmed-instruction design does a good job of breaking them up into digestible chunks, albeit at the cost of making the rulebook harder to use as a reference.

If you still find the rules of the first scenario daunting, though, take a look at Allan Yngve's Tactical Training Series of fan scenarios, available for free on the web.  The early scenarios in the series actually strip Squad Leader down even further than the opening scenario found in the box, and more granular progression through the early parts of the rules than the stock scenarios. As a bonus, they are designed – as the name implies – to help you come to grips with some basic tactical concepts that will serve you well throughout your Squad Leader career.

They also help fix one of my small issues with the care game set – vehicles are introduced far to soon. I'd be happy if half the scenarios, or at least half of the Russia-Germany scenarios, were infantry only. There is plenty to explore within the system without going to vehicles straight away, and for small skirmishes and battles in tight places there is no need to include vehicles thematically, either.

Squad Leader offers all I want from a tactical wargame, without imposing the "lifestyle" demands of ASL.  I really wish I had more opportunities to play it.

This is where I started. Summer 1982, bored out of my head at the cottage of a friend of my mothers. I was 11 years old, and to me, "Risk" was the only wargame that existed.

Then I "discovered" Squad Leader. 25 years later, I have yet to resist the wargaming bug, and am now the father of second generation grognards. Though never a perfect system in and of itself, it is still very playable, thanks to systems like VSQL and Computer Squad Leader (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsquadleader/).

RATING: 7
Was my favorite game from Jr High through college, but then became more and more difficult to find opponents due to the complexity of the system(with 2-4 of the expansions).

Now I find Conflict of Heroes scratches that same itch and is much more approachable.

I received this game for Christmas, 12,80. the rules were immense! I was determined, and learned it. It turned out to be the best game I have ever played.

The second wargame I played. My elder brother almost always beat me as I wasn't smart enough to out tactic him.

Squad Leader was the first war game that I purchased way back in 1985 as a poor high school student.  I spent many hours reading and rereading the rule book and finally found an opponent and I was hooked on the SL system from there.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
IMHO This is the single greatest war game ever created. Please don't judge this system by ASL. I would recommend ASL to a very few folks. I recommend Squad Leader to just about everybody. Combine this with Cross of Iron for the ultimate war game system. The key here is that SL is actually very fun to play. The rules make sense, they aren't a burden on the game, and the games flow fast and smooth. 

I do now prefer the impulse mechanic of newer tactical games (specifically the Lock 'N Load series). I would love to see MMP reissue the original Squad Leader with the Cross of Iron expansion together in one box (and forget about CoD and GI, those are really the start of ASL). My suggestion would be to include a cleaned up version of the fourth edition rules (just rewrite the rule book to account for the CoI rules as well) and include an appendix that details an optional impulse mechanic. Call it Squad Leader Classic and prepare to make money. Put this on kickstarter and I'll fund at the highest level.

Although I think this game is not realistic because of no Command and Control rules and near 100% intel of Battlefield positions, I give this game a 10 out of deep respect.

There's a lot of good stuff in this game and if you pass it by, your missing out.

Great game for its time, and I played the heck out of my purple box copy. The expansions started out promisingly with 'Cross of Iron' (even though my COI counters were badly miscut -- one of the aspects of 'the good ol' days' that I don't miss), but got to be ridiculous, and borderline unplayable with 'Anvil of Victory'. It was if they couldn't justify a new 'gamette' without including a load of new, tedious rules. The original game, SL, was the best of the lot, although I don't think too much of it as a tactical simulator -- it's more of a simulator of a WW2 movie. A good game, and even groundbreaking. I know it delivered something entirely new to me at the time.

RATING: 10
An impressive achievement and the standard against which tactical wargames are (and should be) judged. Immensely complex, but the modular system makes learning the rules as painless as possible. The game began to bog down under the weight of countless additional rules, but the smart player learned to be judicious in implementing them. Again, the modular structure aided in picking and choosing the rules you wanted or were willing to use. Would be a great game even without some (or most) of the later rules. It's a bit harder now to justify the time commitment necessary to enjoy this game. My tastes have in fact turned toward Ambush!, which is more suitable for solitaire play, can be learned quickly and is a better balance of complexity and playability. However, for its quality, innovation and depth, Squad Leader is still a 10.

Fantastic Game.  I really was hooked on this game for a long time.  The games from the original Squad Leader and the first expansion sets were really good.  Somewhere along the line the system got too complicated and I drifted away from it.  It still is one of the best games in the history of simulations.

Recently, I have begun playing Squad Leader again.  I have also worked my way back into Cross of Iron.  The game is really outstanding.

Decent game.  I lost interest when I found the best use for Rommel was directing the fire of a HMG because of his -3 modifier.  Needs to differentiate between officers and NCOs.  Officers allow movement forward, NCO direct fire, senior NCOs in some armies do both.

I know this will brand me as a heretic but Combat Commander is a much better simulation of low level infantry combat.

Well we'll start this at a 7, with the possibility of going higher with more plays. I really enjoyed my first play: simple, just about the right weight.

Regarding the reality factor, I'd say it's definitely more "game" than "sim", even though there's lots of detail and granularity in the system. You feel more like you're playing the intricacies of the phases than WW2 tactics.

Still a remarkable achievement for its time and still highly playable today.

When I bought this game (in 1980), I was into simple games, so I didn't expect to like this one.  But it bowled me over, it was so good.  Most exciting wargame I'd ever played, hands down.

It was a very nice concept when it first came out. It's graphics were a little better than the only other game similar to it which was Tobruk. Tobruk's game play was a better but Squad Leader covered a broader spectrum of WWII than the desert war.

I don't own this game but I did play it some with a friend back in high school.

In general its not a bad game, but I found it very hard to get into and some stuff seemed a bit too abstracted to me.  In particular I remember one game that involved the possibility of "Sewer" movement.  In general, if I am recalling correctly, the rules more or less assumed you could move form one hex to another on the board just hidden and at a different rate of movement.  That seemed kind of odd to me, in that I had always heard of various urban legends about how much of a maze sewers can be and how easy it can be to get lost in them.

Another thing was that some of the ratings seemed a bit arbitrary to me.  I never really understood why some units had attack strengths of 6 while others had values of 4 or less.  It may have been due to the number of people in the unit, the specific type of weapon they used or maybe because of the supposed training of the troops, but overall the numbers just seemed kind of arbitrary to me.

My first wargame of any consequence.  We played this thing to death.  Enough depth to give keep you interested, but not too much (until the addons later) to  cause most players to have analysis paralysis.  I wish my buddy hadn't borrowed my original, put it in his storage unit, and didn't bother to pay the bill.  I did get 2 shrink copies of it and all the gamettes though.

Well this is not easy to rate today. It was the game that brought me into playing really good wargames, so 30+ years back this would be a crystal-clear 10, for today's standards plus credits for sentiments and impact on my gaming experience I'd say a 7 is really OK. Though I'd never go back from ASL to play its grand-daddy.

The BEST tactical wargame ever; from basic SL through ASL, you choose from many hundred's of scenarios for size, complexity, and nationalities.  This game has flavor, tension, decision making, and all the nuances of detail that can be imagined.  I'd give it a 10 if I gave any 10's.

RATING: 7
A classic, one of the best squad level games out there. Basic Squad Leader is fairly straight forward and not complex compared to other wargames. 
I can recommend the base version.

However, most of the expansions added complexity without improved play, so by the end the layers of chrome and complexity collapsed the system.

This was sold in one of the game purges, a move I regret, but not enough yet to repurchase.

Initial comments, prior to fully learning the game....

The map board gets too crowded, so I take a BGGer's advice to scan and enlarge the map board by 80-something%.

The rulebook is above average, but Rule 11.3 is important and should not have been hidden in a footnote.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Seminal tactical wargame. Took lessons from Panzerblitz and Panzer Leader, applied them to a lower level of conflict and changed the industry. The expansions gradually broke the system and resulted in an even larger expansion with Advanced Squad Leader. 
Strengths-extraordinarily large player base. Its modeling of morale was a revelation.
Weaknesses-may have over-emphasized the impact of the machine gun. More tellingly, its version of how the different nationalities act under fire seems to be grounded more by play balance, some books and movies, than by reality. The design is just as biased as earlier designs, but this one is fun.

This is actually a simple very playable wargame IF YOU STOP READING THE RULES WHEN IT GETS TOO HARD.  I have introduced this to many non-gamers with some success.  The infantry stuff is very simple - the vehicles make life harder as do the more and more elaborate rules.  Good to play in teams with a few people a side with just infantry, machine guns and maybe a flame thrower.

RATING: 9
A watershed title among wargames.  This was the second game I purchased after stumbling back into the hobby in late 1977, and was my favorite game for many years.  I still believe it is superior to ASL.  What befell Squad Leader was the number of rule changes made via its own sequels that resulted in it being nearly impossible for two people to know whether they were assuming the same rules in any particular game.  Avalon Hill's "remedy" was ASL, which was certainly consistent, but so massive it required nearly singular devotion to the exclusion of other games.  It also broke forever the original design goal of Squad Leader to be a simple, playable game.  Proof that if war is too important to be left to the generals, wargame design is too fragile to be left to the grognards.

Still holding on as my favorite.  But, ATS/LnL have a lot of features which I wish SqL had.

I got bored with the spin-offs after COD.  Tried out ASL but found the rulebook referencing just got out of control (but, I must admit it helped me be a better military pilot 'cause dash one and flight regs read a lot like the SqL/ASL rulebooks!)

RATING: 7.5
The old classic, from which so much has sprung. Despite the excesses of later expansions, the original game is very good and playable. The main thing that keeps me from generally recommending it is that you either have to accept limitations on scope, or introduce the expansions, at which point you should go to [SK]ASL anyway.

I really don't like the lop-sided luck factor and how it hides itself behind a huge complicated law codex to mask itself as a tactical game, while it is essentially risk with some modifiers. Tactical decisions matter very little compared to the huge variance component. Unless you call 'not running into an opponent's gunline a "tactical" decision'. This game is for those geniuses who think it is.

Of the hundreds of wagames that I've owned and played over my gaming career, this is my all time favorite. If I was stranded on a desert island and could only have one game with me, this would be it.  The mechanics, after almost 30 years, are still the most elegant and intuitive I've ever seen.  Multiple scenarios and the expansion gamettes make this endlessly replayable.

Without a doubt the Citizen Kane of infantry wargames. If you can get through the rules and the more that come with supplements, there is no better game in this genre (well... there’s ASL, which is better, but even more rules).

Not a Squad Leader fanatic. Played it & the first few modules a lot in the distant past but really only because everyone else wanted to.

Some old wargames are like a black-n-white movie; not modern tech by any standards, but beautiful in their own way.  Squad Leader is the Citizen Kane of WW2 tactical wargaming.  Everything we take for granted started here...  Not clean, and every rule is an exception or special case, but in the end it flows together pretty well.  Just realise the rules are for reference, and not for learning.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
A classic game that didn't really need to be developed into anything more complex.  The expansions really just needed to be that:  more maps, more scenarios, more nationalities, maybe a few extra rules for terrain and armour/ordnance. The "programmed instruction" rules made it easy to learn, and many scenarios could be played in less than 2 hours on a single 11X17 map.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Definitely a superior game to its overcomplicated descendant.  Still, the tracking system for defensive fire is distinctly inferior to just about every other system out there, and many of the assumptions about combat (the way leaders are portrayed, the binary good order/broken damage system) are antiquated.  The scenarios are excellent, but at this point there are better options out there.

For me, this game is the beginning of the "grognard" evolution in true wargames and simulations.  While I admire the detail and intricacy of the game, I just lose patience and it's just not that much fun.  I had to give this one away to "Goodwill"...just don't have time for as many games any longer, and no one will play this one anymore, and I'm no longer very enthusiastic about it either.  So long!

Very hard to rank. It is way too complicated for my taste, but the, that is as it is intended to be. I have decided that I think that this decision is not a good one. Can do nearly everyting with it - but then, just having a seperate game that is very good at doing something might be a better choice.
I like this less than ASL, because its inconsistency makes it even more confusing.

Decades ago I read about a mythical game called "IT". IT was a game of WWII at a scale of 1 man per counter and maybe 10 feet per hex. IT was literally a joke, but that's what I thought about the first time I saw Squad Leader: Tactical squad and individual vehicle combat during WWII. The components can be a little busy, but they represent well, and the vehicle counters were about the best out there until 'Panzer Grenadier' arrived. The rule book is only 35 pages long, but the print is about 8 point font and just looks gray at arms length. Avalon Hill knew they were breaking new ground with such rules and they tried to solve it with 'Programmed Instruction'; feeding you the rules a little bit at a time with small training scenarios - it worked. I put a lot of effort into learning, and got a lot of enjoyment from playing, this game. Later I bought ASL, module by module, and pored over the rules, like they were an encyclopedia. But I kept coming back to SL, while the ASLs sat unpunched on my shelf. Great game, and good enough.

Absolutely essential. No, Squad Leader IS NOT the last word in tactical combat simulation. Its warts are well known. Eye-in-the sky viewpoint, 40-meter-wide boulevards, etc.

What Squad Leader IS: a remarkable blend of war game and RPG. So much so that it included rules for adding yourself as a counter. This is a game that generates narratives you'll remember for years afterward, and the programmed instruction method gives it the feel of a military training course.

In the grim darkness of High School there was only Warhammer 40,000, until the time requirements -- painting and so on -- made it incompatible with a life outside the hobby. I played Go for a while and then drifted into eurogames, but wargames were over.

I'd always been curious about games like Advanced Squad Leader, played by serious men with serious beards, using serious counters and not squads of pretty pretty man-dollies. I picked up Squad Leader cheap after reading some comments here like djlg's:

"Thinking of getting into ASL? Try this first. Same basic mechanics, but more focussed on design for effect rather than ASL's design for cause."

[b]1. The Guards Counterattack[/b]

It was a hard slog sorting out the Cross of Iron and Crescendo of Doom counters (thanks, eBay seller!) from the base game, but finally I got it done and had a friend around to play a game.

History was not my best subject, so all I got from the scenario flavour text was "Russians vs. Germans".

First game, I took the Germans and set up at the front of the buildings. We had missed the rule about long range firing, so my opponent assumed his squads were out of range for prep fire. They charged through open ground and were slaughtered by my defensive fire. He resigned after one turn.

If we stopped there we would've never played again, so I turned the board around and took my turn as the Russians. Setup was easy; none of the Germans had moved. He set up at the rear of the buildings, out of sight, which gave me a free turn to position.

It seemed almost like the first game's rout, but in reverse: poor German defensive fire let me capture a building (and two LMGs) immediately. Things went less well after that, as the Germans in the East held firm and repeatedly rallied their broken troops. Reinforcements couldn't reach the centre building due to large German squads defending fire corridors on each side.

I might still have won if I hadn't made a catastrophic mistake and lost two squads and my best leader in one turn. (My opponent rolling snake eyes didn't help.) After that, it was a quick mop-up and a second, albeit less convincing, German victory.

I normally prefer the luckless euro; here there are so many dice, and so many modifiers, that the wargamer's claim that play is about managing the probabilities actually felt true. (This was not my experience in more streamlined games where more typically rides on a single roll.) Sure, it's frustrating to repeatedly roll 12s or have your one unbroken Russian squad rally so hard it goes berserk and attacks at 1-3 odds, leaving behind your only MMG. It's worse when your opponent's low-power attack gets a KIA. Almost all our losses were from morale checks on broken squads.

The broad swings were the result of poor tactical choices. I understand that there are some complaints about the first scenarios because the urban combat teaches nothing about manouevering on open ground, and as such are actively [i]un[/i]helpful, but I learned a lot. Spread out your units so you don't lose everything in one shot! Don't run through open ground at a machine gun nest if you can help it! (That one should have been obvious.)

Compared to my previous wargame experience, I much prefer hex movement over measuring inches. I'm tempted to try the optional residual fire rules for defensive fire, though.

We got some rules wrong (MG penetration, forgot about desperation morale, and most seriously range, which we read as inclusive of both the firing unit and the target) and had a hell of a time trying to find half-remembered rules about MG portage, or whatever. Is it under machine guns or movement or...? I'm a little sceptical about making it all the way through regular Squad Leader, let alone Cross of Iron, and Crescendo of Doom is out of the question. Special rules for moving Finnish ski paratroops through sewers... no thanks.

I look forward to the next scenario.

One of the earlier games in my hobby "career". I particularly like the early scenarios with a limited number of units and manageable rules. By the time the expansions were released the game had grown too complex and we were on to other games, simpler fare like the Third Reich ;-) Squad level tactical combat has been well covered by computer games, particularly modern consol games, but as a study in weapon types and weapon systems, I think Squad Leader (at least the ASL version) still has a place in the hobby.

Another game I played solidly for some years, working my way through almost all of the available scenarios, sometimes more than once. There are major historical problems here, but as a game and a flavoursome evocation of WWII tactics, it has no rivals. While I owned SL/COI/COD and GI, we used only SL/COI rules with scenario specific additions. I remain one of the gamers who wanted a revised set of SL rules rather than ASL with its ridiculous detail and acronyms. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: N/A
I only have the original box and rulebook now.   A revolutionary game for the time.  I had previously fell in love with AH's Tobruk, which I played endlessly.  I even made up my own rules and counters for buildings and made up urban fight scenarios.  When I saw the ad for Squad Leader I know my dream game had arrived, I bought SL without hesitation.  I'm told my box, which is purple, was among the very first prints produced in 1977. I have always kept it for that reason.  I think I gave most of the pieces to my old gaming pal Don on Long Island.  He never made the switch to ASL and he had this huge SL game set up in his basement made up of dozens of boards and hundreds of counters.  It was quite a site, never seen anything like it since.

The original and the best! Costs next to nothing to get into these days. Plenty of fantastic new scenarios being developed by the SL internet community, including a terrific series of training scenarios for learning the game. Huge internet community playing online and pbem on the VASSAL server. Works extremely well as PBEM. Definitely NOT outdated and is really not that complex - 6 pages of rules gets you started. Most internet players play SL level rules without expansions and gameplay is smooth as silk.

Excellent game, but if you want to play ASL get a starter kit insted of Squad Leader.  Not an easy transition from SL to ASL to many rules differences and counters are different as well.  If you play the ASL Starter Kit's you pick up on a lot of the basics and will make the transition to full ASL easier,  this will not happen if you play SL.

My wife and I pbm'd this after she left college.  I dumped my set along with ASL but hers is still here.

I had to remove the rating as my long experience with ASL has tainted me.  This game really deserves better than the 6 I gave it.

RATING: 9
Satisfying game with the rules as written. Some cherry picking from Cross of Iron makes the game a winner for me. I never bothered to advance further into the other offshoots of this classic. There was a missed opportunity to explore the other nationalities and settings while remaining faithful to the original rules but alas the market had other preferences for more detail to the point of convolution.

RATING: 8
One of the first tactical games I ever owned. This game is one of the best games of this sort out there. The scenario selection is very well balanced, and "grows the rules" in a step-by-step/ scenario-by-scenario method. The rules are quite clear, which is very helpful.  You can learn a great deal, tactically, about squad warfare, yet in a fun way.

An unbelievable amount of fun.  I have moments during play where I think to myself "geez, I just love Squad Leader".  I cannot say that I've had similar thoughts with many other games.  I have components to COI, COD and ASL, but use them to play in the SL framework.  I simply don't want the added complexity at this point. Basic SL works just fine (though I have ordered the Retro rules to see what that's all about).

I have played this many times.  I have the three expansion sets (Cross of Iron, Crescendo of Doom, and G.I.:  Anvil of Victory) plus some other scenarios.  I gave up when AH released the much more expensive ASL and concentrated on miniatures instead.

Squad Leader started my love afair with board games in 1976. I spent the entire family Winnebago trip to the west reading the rules and playing this game while the wheat fields of Kansas passed by. This and reading Winnetou by Karl May, since we were off to explore the lands of the Apaches! It does not get any more exciting than this for a German kid. 
Both true classics.

Never got past the 3rd scenario. An obviously impressive design, masterfully put together. Not a big fan of small unit tactics, with their endless modifiers. You can't seem to take a breath in this game witout endless multiple modifiers applied. I don't consider that the most elegant mechanism, but would like to try this again some day nonetheless, as well as the ASLSK's. Hoping there is something more there than I originally thought.

I spent approximately 40% of my childhood playing this game and its expansions.  Picked it up cheap on ebay for the nostalgia.  Favorite scenario: the assault on the tractor factory.  This is still a strong game even though it was published in 1977.  Still easy to get, as 200,000 copies were sold.  Strongly recommend buying Cross if Iron to go with the base game, as Squad Leader's armor rules are a bit weak.  Dont recommend CoD or GI because of massive rules bloat.  (ive played them all extensively, trust me on this)  There are many sites online for fan-designed scenarios.

Seems like years since I broke this all out of the box, but whenever I do I remember why I loved it so much as an 18 year old.  In fact, this game belongs in the closet of every male teenage boy.  The bachelor's degree in WWII small unit tactics to ASL's graduate program.  What else can be said?

My first and only Avalon Hill bookcase game - found it in a toy store at Whistler of all places and splurged to get it (in terms of allowance).   I've only played the the first scenario - Guards Counterattack - and skimmed the rest of the rules.  The infantry-only rules are pretty straightforward,  and solo play was pretty impressive - a great "cinematic war movie" feel.

Without going too deep into the expansions, game play is tight and keeps the players involved. Critical decisions every turn. A little too much die-rolling for multiple morale checks and unit stacking can be a bother but otherwise, a terrific game.

When this game came out it was like a revolution in wargaming design. It was a must own for every gamer I knew.
World War 2 at the squad level. Ranged fire. Lines of sight. Individual machine guns and tanks. Individual officers with their own special abilities.  Maps that could be rearranged in different ways to constantly vary the look of the terrain. Outstanding game design!
I never bought any of the expansions, or varients, or even extra maps. I didn't have to! Everyone I knew was buying them, so I just played on theirs. My brother has so much Squad Leader stuff that it would take a giant wheelbarrow just to carry them around. Hell, maybe even a front end loader! 
Our wargame club became obsessed with this game. I watched in horror as they combined a dozen or more maps and created their own scenarios that would cover entire pingpong tables and more! They turned a simple and very quickly played game into monsters! Given enough room they might have tried to play the entire war at squad level!
Eventually I just burned out on it. I've always preferred the operational or strategic over the tactical anyway.
The game has continued to evolve over the years. I believe it is safe to say that Squad Leader along with all it's expansions, varients and descendants is probably the biggest selling and most played wargame of all time!
Still a great game, especially in it's original form, for beginners to play. The basic scenarios can be set up and played in an hour or so. A must for any beginner who really wants to feel the hobby.

John Hill had it right - this was conceived as a "beer & pretzels" game of "heroic" WWII combat. A GENERAL feel for WWII infantry combat tactics is as far as Squad Leader's ambition as a simulation goes. As such, it is a landmark title, and, like 1979's Star Fleet Battles Designer's Edition, came packed with options - design-your-own by points or random force selection, a campaign game, and three distinct nationalities. The isomorphic, hand-painted map-boards are still impressive. Having played a fair amount of ASL, at the end of the day I have to admit I prefer Squad Leader. I would draw the line at Cross of Iron.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is EXACTLY what a squad level combat game should be; if you are designing a squad level game and you don't use this as the basis; in my opinion, you are doing it wrong!

This is a great system even after adding the Cross of Iron module but if are going to go any further in the system than that just go with ASL since Crescendo of Doom and Anvil of victory are what precipitated the need for ASL.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Oh, the memories. The Guards counterattacks! Fun! 

Not so fun beyond Cross of Iron though.I have a feeling that this entire series went seriously overboard beyond CoI. That was pretty typical of the times as the late 70s and early 80s often meant overcomplicated and massive games.

The reason I like wargames is due to a second-hand purchase of Squad Leader back in the mid-80's.  Totally transformed my concept of what a good wargame can do.  Complex, but not obtuse.  A great way to introduce yourself to the hobby and art that is wargaming.

A neat and very innovative approach to squad-based combat, feels very flexible. The programmed learning method is nice: going through scenarios adding a few new things to each as you go. Admittedly I never got into the vehicle rules, which added many more layers of complexity; the infantry stuff what enough fun on its own.

The more I play it- the more I like it. Originally rated it a 9. No 10 due to the large and cumbersome rules. But a +1 bonus because of the staggering amount of free material available(scenarios, AARs etc). Or +1 because it's still alive: free downloadable version for vFtF or PbeM. Still great online support through mailing lists. All my questions so far have been answered within 2 days by enthousiasts. And that for a game nearly as old as I am. That, combined with the fact that this is the wargame I play most (FtF), make it a solid 10 for me. I don't know if it's Outstanding, but it keeps hitting the table and I suspect that'll never change.

RATING: 7.5
I've always been a Tolkien fan, so naturally I bought some cards of the Limited and first Unlimited editions in the late 90's and built a deck, but never ended up playing the game more than a handful of times. Seemed like an interesting, thematic and fun CCG with some pretty cool ideas, though.

RATING: 10
Without a doubt, one of the most thematic, immersive, and enjoyable games I own. Yes, card management and organization is a royal pain, but it's worth it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
An excellent and flavorful game for Tolkien's world, without the collation issues that many of the CCGs of the time suffered from. Probably the best CCG not named Magic (I feel Netrunner is a better game, but it breaks down as more cards are acquired). Has some rough spots and it is a bit difficult for beginners to pick up, though. Stick to the first couple of expansions for the best experience.

This game used to be so good when it first came out - fantastic artwork and enjoyable game play. Then out came the Lidless Eye set and killed the game stone dead overnight. From a 9.5 down to about a generous 5 - a real shame. Currently buying again, but only the first set and 2 expansions.

Is been a while since I played of game of this, sadly not many people play it anymore, is a huge money eater (Like any other CCG) but if you are a huge Tolkien fan you will like this game.

RATING: 5
picked up a box of preconstructed sealed challenge decks.  the learning curve seems fairly steep: wonky beginner vs advanced rules, external printed map use is recommended, tons of card text, etc.  it's not surprising that it failed to ultimately compete in a ccg market against the likes of mtg and pokemon.  playing with preconstructed stuff, it's not immediately clear to me how many gameplay decisions are really being made.  if the whole game is in the deckbuilding, and the gameplay is a matter of running your train down the tracks you've laid, i think i'll end up being somewhat dissatisfied.  the theme is a bit baffling to me too.  one is supposed to be competing for the right to simply lead the armies of good or evil, but in doing so one is screwing over members of the same team and perhaps even solving ultimate goals such as destroying the one ring.  i'm still having fun with it though, and this is by no means a definitive rating.

Fue mi primer ccg y por eso le guardo un cariño especial. Mucho antes de las peliculas, mucho antes de todo el fenomeno Lotr... acabé sabiendo de memoria la geografia, y personajes. Muchisimas partidas a cuestas... probablemente fue el primer juego que me enseñó que la victora se podia conseguir por distintos cauces y eso es vital para mi MUNDO. Partidas con lo amigos de entonces, Carlos, Alfonso, Israel... qué tiempos!!.
Consistía en elaborte un mazo, llevar un grupo de guerreros (compañia) y realizar misiones por la Tierra Media, jugando cartas en tu turno que te llevaran a la victoria. Mientras más puntos otorgaran tu mision, más dificil de conseguir sería. Las adversidades que sufrias eran jugadas por tu oponente (no recuerdo si el de la izda o dcha)... Tenía un encanto, una atmosfera... realmente inalcanzable ahora mismo por la candidez y la inocencia de aquellos tiempos.. ya soy perro viejo, es un pena.

The best CCG ever created and still as playable and good 10 years after it went out of print.  unfortunately because it is so good cards are hard to come by these days.

Best CCG I've played (and I' ve played a lot of them) and one of my all time favorite games. Gorgeous art, beautiful roleplaying mechanics. True to the books, an adventure that can last hours. Fun to play even when you lose. Multiple ways to win, tons of strategy. Detriments? Rules are complex and games can be long, especially with multiple players. If you love Middle Earth, however, well worth the effort.

RATING: 6.5
Comes with a lot of atmospheare. Best artwork, most of tolkien-canon-painters made contributions. you really travel through middle-earth with this game. flaw: like any other ccg, the game is won before it starts (during deck construction).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Update: I believe my previous rating was filtered through rose-colored glasses. Modern customizable card games prove that even after a substantial number of releases, such a game doesn't need to devolve into a bloated mess.

----------

Complete "player set" (at least 1 of every unique, at least 3 of every non-unique) for every set (METW-MEBA) except missing 1 set of MEBA.

Absolutely wonderful game.  The only thing preventing it from earning a 10 rating is the very healthy pile of errata and rather thick CRF.  No other LotR game even comes close to the level of Middle-earth goodness this out-of-print CCG provides.

PureAdventure, LordOfTheRings, Solo

It's a portable Middle Earth story you play out!  Much more portable than Knizia's Lord of the Rings game, and far less fussy than the recent War of the Ring, and more thematic than Lord of the Rings: the Confrontation.  Covers more of the Middle Earth we know from the books, and lets you use little-known characters.  Plus the game is cheap like borscht on ebay.  I have only used the Challenge decks (and then, only the wizard decks---I'm less sure of the nazgul decks, especially the twisted logic and "background" that ICE started to use for them).  When played solitaire (away from PBEM or face to face), pretty good.  I found the real solitaire rules in the Wizards Players Guide, and with multiple hazard decks, any solitaire game is a challenge.
  
I keep this game around because it's basically a very flexible story-telling game system for Middle Earth, with a in-depth look into Tolkien's world that no other game out there matches.  The portability is just icing on the cake.

Bought this in primary school, the rules were quite difficult back then, but our Lord of the Rings enthusiasm made us play this a lot back in the day. HAven't played in years but I still remember so many quotes from the flavor texts. To my understanding the finnish version had some changed rules compared to english edition, or at least not all the cards seemd to be compatible.

SImply the best CCG I've ever played.  It gives attention to detail, but has a rich array of strategies that can be used.  Moreover, it is much harder to buy your way to victory than with other CCG's.  

The mix of combats and corruption make the game work well.  One ring decks are a lot different, and add a very different feel to the game.  

There are much fewer worthless cards than a lot of game.  Indeed, the commons often dominate the game, like the big environment cards.

I'm a hard core wargamer, and I think its superb!  Should appeal to all kinds of gamers.

The only slight negative I give is that we often find we keep our wizards in havens to avoid insta-losses.

Really trying to fully grasp the rules on this. While it is fairly complicated to learn...this game is worth it tenfold!!! The game just drips with theme. Also plays well solo (especially with variants you can find on BGG). Check out the four part video from callasmar on BGG. I found it to be extremely, extremely helpful. He does use some home-ade variants for playing solo; but it is well worth watching!!

Best CCG ever - if it hadn't been a CCG then it would be a 10. If it was still in print and being played a '9'. Steep learning curve, but a gem of a game, lots of deck possibilities and you don't need all the rares to compete. Unfortunately distinct lack of players means I rarely get chance to play :(

I don't think I'll ever play in a constructed tournament now, current metagame is full of 'cheese' decks designed to minimise luck, minimise player interaction that just turn the game into multiplayer solo, just see who's deck clicks first Zzzzzzzz. But I'll happily play casual games, challenge deck games, or 3+ deck games etc, or even sealed deck

Great card game. These days I've just constructed challenge decks and play it like a regular game rather than a deck construction game. Removes some of the meta-game, but still the most thematic journey to Middle Earth that I've played yet. Artwork is amazing.

Best trading card game I tried so far: pretty complex with lots of options. Play as the free people, the minions of Sauron, a fallen wizard or even the Balrog. All these factions have their special cards and even different rules! It´s not about the movies...you´re completely free to explore every area in middle earth. You might try to destroy the ring, muster armies, look for valuable artifacts or kill dragons. Replayability is amazing, but the learning curve is really high and you have to invest a lot of time and money to optimize your deck.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
Own complete sets of every U.S. release, all U.S. promos &  the Gift Set.

The best CCG bar none, probably because it really is a card-driven boardgame (not to mention the Middle Earth milieu).  Beautiful artwork and art design combined with game play that creates a story better than any other CCG.  It also provides for 'in-game' deck composition changes (via a sideboard) so that one can adapt to one's opponent's strategies.

Slight update to my enthusiasm.  I have played Netrunner now.  I believe it provides more tension consistently than MECCG, has loads of options (though not as much as MECCG).  It has moved up to a close 2nd in my rankings.  Jyhad/Vampire is still the best multiplayer C/LCG, but 3rd on my list.

This is the best CCG out there, as far as I'm concerned.  M:tG might be a good game but the expense is just too crippling.  In ME:tW, some of the best cards in the game are Common and some of the weakest are Rare; it's more about frequency of use than outright power.  Moreover, the sense of theme and story is fabulous.  It's a shame they lost the license for Tolkein's world, 'cos they did treat it with reverence and respect -- and didn't make an absolute hash of it, like Games Workshop with their redraft of Warhammer Fantasy Battle with its flimsy Middle Earth veneer (and expensive minis).  I have the Elrond prebuilt deck plus a fair few Commons.

RATING: 5
A good game, a mix of adventure, roleplaying, and the luck vs. skill of deckbuilding. The only problem is that this game is collectible, and that too many cards require owning another card to play. If they could bring this back with one complete set to purchase, it would have more traction (like with Doomtown: Reloaded, or Android: Netrunner). Gorgeous art, and more Middle-Earth lore that even a level 8 Tolkienite would know.

This just hits the spot for me - very faithful to the setting, good gameplay and interersting design features.  Not as complex as its reputation but then I avoid the Agent & Minion rules - they work fine but don't work thematically for me. Othar than that it has outstanding atmospherics. Quite superb.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
My comments below about the game not being crazy-expensive may be somewhat out of date. It looks like some earlier sets (The Dragons, the Challenge Decks) which had pretty big print runs are still not too hard to get, but some of the later stuff which was printed in smaller quantities (Lidless Eye, The Balrog) can be pretty pricey.
---
The ultimate gamer's CCG, MECCG strikes a fine balance between meta-game deck construction and the tactical play of the game itself. There is a misconception amongst some observers that you need a ton of cards to play - this is absolutely untrue. Without the "colors", "cultures", or whatever that restrict deck-building, you can put virtually any card in any deck and so can build quite competitive (and, crucially, interesting) decks with a fairly modest outlay. Plus, it's a fabulous (far and away the best) recreation of Tolkien's masterpiece. Highest recommendation, and it's rather cheap these days. The only caveat is that things do get seriously wierd in the later sets, especially Against the Shadow and The White Hand. My advice would be to a) never play cross-alignment games, which don't quite work (Fallen-Wizards are Heros); b) allow entire custom hazard decks vs. Balrog and Fallen-Wizards, if you're adventurous enough to try those alignments; and c) consider agents optional, and if you want to play with them, agree to their use ahead of time. The best sets are the basic set, the Dragons, and Lidless Eye. The game is especially well-designed from the perspective of playing modest-sized collections; the best games actually come from playing with modest, but not substantial, collections.

In my oppinion, the one and only Middle Earth game ever.
Its neat with the basic rules, but with some determination and the goodwill to work through a deeper level of gameplay you can use the free movement rules and enjoy the experience of freely traveling Middle Earth!
Maybe its possible to get scans of the cards. The art comes from a mix of the best fantasy artists at that time, and the inspiration mostly from Tolkiens original scetches and concepts.
Its a lot of work to get this going, but worth it
Yeah... I didnt say anything about the rules... They are complex. Many. Dicerolls. Endless possibilities! Dont' play this with people prone to AP ^_^
But once you got it its like riding a horse down to Rivendell...

Rich, detailed, and complex, MECCG is the Magic Realm of that genre.  It's really not terribly difficult once you get past the learning curve but it does take quite a bit more patience and commitment than the typical CCG or board game.  This is a really excellent design, it requires some fixing up and patience to really get going but in all it's quite a treat if you like themeatic, narrative games with substantial depth.  It's almost better than Netrunner...

Picked up more than enough cards for a while: the companion book, the maps, the challenge decks, and a large assortment of other cards.  Still need to learn to play, though.  I probably have enough stuff that I could trade some of it away, and still have plenty to play myself. Nonetheless, in terms of variety, I wouldn't mind getting more cards, especially from Dark Minions, and possibly The Lidless Eye.  Maybe even some more Wizards cards, although I have quite a few of those.  I have an unopened booster box of Dragons, so acquiring more of those seems unnecessary at the moment.

Components: Thematic artwork. But the essential text on each card is difficult to read (especially the region/site icons), and to pick out the power text from the quotations.

Experience: One aborted initial game of slogging through rules, becoming familiar with the turn order and objectives.

Another aborted game eight years later, with a better understanding of the rules.

So far is reminding me quite a bit of The Lord of the Rings Trading Card Game, most specifically because we each play minions against each other; the minion actions are limited by the actions taken by the free peoples, and it usually seems sensible to just play every card I can.

Still will try it again.

The modest number of plays don't do justice to the huge amount of enjoyment I've had from sorting through the cards & decks that I received when I traded for this game. I've been lucky to also be given a nearly complete set of the cards too. The range of the cards I have (mainly from Wizards & Dragons sets, but also a fair mix from the later sets) is ample to amuse my forays into solo games. I just wish I could play it a bit more.

I think this is definitely in my top three ccgs. You can find great solo variants of this online, so I've had a great time with this game solo and playing against others. The main downside is it is difficult to aquire these cards anymore.

One of the best collectible card games out there.  Really enjoy building the decks and creating my own stories or reliving the adventures from the books.  Much more enjoyable if you have a map to play with instead of using the travel cards.  Only bad thing is trying to find others that actually own this game.

A great way to get in the game is to purchase Middle Earth Challenge Decks.  They are preconstructed decks with five containing a deck based on each of the five wizards and five based on five of the ringwraiths.

RATING: 10
This is one of my all-time favorite games period, and I'm not a huge CCG fan.  This is really a board game, and should have been produced as such, as in many ways it's really hapmered by the CCG format (not even counting the collectible aspect).  Really outstanding, but complex, but worth it.  Captures the feel of Middle-Earth the best of any other game by far.  Far superior to the Lord of the Rings CCG which was really dumbed down, and hence made more popular.  You can do just about anything you want in this game (destroy the one ring, collect up all the palantirs, go dragon slaying) though as has been said elsewhere, a lot of the expansions added some pretty complicated and in some cases game-breaking mechanics, but they can still be fun to play around with as long as you don't take it too seriously.

One of the most atmospheric game experiences to be had. The game oozes theme. Main drawback is its complexity: it can be a bit difficult to learn and master, but there are some good aids out there. This would certainly be rated more highly if I could convince someone to play it several times and had some opportunity to explore the richness and depth that I see here. Over the years, I acquired hundreds of cards. Hoping the offspring will bite!

My favourite CCG next to LBS. Great fun even with few cards available, just make sure you use a map instead of site cards and you should be all set. 

I'm not really happy with the later expansions as I think both Fallen-Wizard and Balrog decks are broken which have kept me away from the tournament scene since their arrival. For best results both (all) players should have the same alignment, either Hero vs. Hero or RW vs. RW.

An awesome early CCG with great customizing and theme. In this game, the designers threw Middle Earth characters and things on the cards, but it is up to you to create the stories via deck design! Perfect for Tolkein's rich world: it lets players free from the narrow and confining story of the destruction of the ring. Somewhat too theme-heavy for the hazard decks, but the built-in sideboard mechanic helps a lot with the 'rock-paper-scissors' issue.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
I could've retired by now had I not spent so much money on this. Still, I love this game. I realize that as per rules and competetive gameplay Magic is the superior design. I never played this competetively. The goal was always to tell the best story. 4 times through the deck (that's roughly a 5 hour game + deck construction). Sometimes when I am in a tight spot, I think of this game and I feel all right. That makes it a ten. I know some people would rate like "I really like it, but it is too expensive (which is true) and you can hardly ever play it because it takes for ever (which ist true, too), so it is only a 7". That's not me. This is love!

Despite being a CCG this isn't really a "sit down and play" kind of game. It's a commitment, and in some ways feels more like a table-top game trying to simulate an RPG than a conventional board or card game. 

Lots of rules, lots of card text, and lots of stuff to keep track of. Some of the art is beautiful, and I generally appreciate the card design, even though Tolkien isn't really my thing. 

Despite being one of the first "MtG killers" this feels less like a copy and more of a unique beast that demands a different type of player and set of skills. 

Plays great solo!

RATING: 9.5
The best card game I've ever played and one of the most emotional and more immersive for fans of Tolkien and Middle-earth adventures games. The quality of your artwork is outstanding, and the complexity of its reglament is overcome by learning how intuitive it is. The only downside is that it is collectable, although for some it is a motivation to have it. Very immersive and exciting, with multiple alternatives of victory, multiple ways to build your playing decks, and total replayability, a part of which can play up to 5 people, but becomes more competitive in the one on one.

If you are looking for specific cards to trade for another item on your For Trade list, please let me know what you are looking for via Geekmail first by sending a list, and I will see if I have them to spare. Please be courteous and tell me every thing you are looking for upfront, as I don't want to go through the boxes multiple times for the same person.

The approximate percentage breakdown of what I have in my collection is as follows, but this is purely a guess.

The Wizards 65%
The Dragons 30%
Dark Minions 5%

The answer is "yes", I actually have a fair amount of extra rares to trade away. For example, I think I have two extra of the "One Ring" in my collection.

No longer in print, but rightly regarded as one of the best CCGs.  Complex but brilliantly themed, almost like a role-playing board game on Middle Earth - game play can be enhanced when playing with a map.  Get the pre-constructed Challenge Decks.  See my review here: http://bgg.cc/thread/65513
The only drawback to this game is the steep learning curve on the rules and the lengthy playing time, so sadly it rarely gets played, despite it being a brilliant game.

A really sprawling game with a weird feel - you are both a hero and your opponents villain, which is quite unusual. The rules feel a bit loose at times, and the amount of exceptions and special cases is mind-boggling. There is also something a bit weird about having all your wizard's plans and allies and destinations in your deck/sideboard - it feels a bit limiting for a true adventure, but this is a very minor niggle. Overall I think its a great game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 10
This is the Cadillac of collectible card games: Big and heavy rule set, but a dreamily smooth ride if you can handle it.  What began as something twice as complex as Magic got increasingly complex with each expansion: a few players would be increasingly delighted, but another few would run for the hills.  The game in its entirety is too demanding for casual players, but is richly themed and subtly nuanced.  Liberal use of 2d6 rolls make it a game of calculated risks on top of card draw luck, and innovative sideboard mechanics support complex deck designs.  Card games really don't come better than this.

For those who enjoy adventure and storytelling, this was the CCG.  Had the best prize support and fan base when ICE was around.  Great mechanics.  A timeless favorite.

Once a year, for the past 6 years now, the only place to be in the world during a weekend in late february is at Castle Stahlbeck in Bacharach, Germany.  There a feast of MECCG gaming in all its most grandiose and fantastic can be had with hundreds of players from everywhere.  This year I played with germans, czechs, fins, swedes, french and japanese players.  Check it out:

An excellent CCG faithful to the books rather than the films which appeared five years later. ICE was unable to support the game, however, and it vanished rather suddenly from the market. Far more complicated than most CCGs, including MtG, but it did a great job of being Tolkeinish. Sadly, this complexity apparently kept the main CCG-consuming segment of the market, the kiddies, away from the game. Shame, this could have been the second banana to MtG, which is damn good. If you can find some cards, grab them, this is a very good game. I wish someone would take the game off ICE's hands and produce a non-collectible version. I'd snap that up in a sec. This is only a six for scarcity of the game and of players; it could easily have been an eight, at least, with a stronger base.

Long and slow card game that was, for a time, a real new approach to the world created by Tolkien. Playing a 5 players game (each player taking one of the five Istari -Gandalf, Saruman, Pallando, Alatar and Radagast) could take more than 5 hours of intense game.

The system, probably, has been overruned by new and more refreshing playing styles but it still keeps some good "old fashion sensations". I enjoyed a lot when I was 16 years old (when I write this I'm 35) and I have all that wonderful cards in boxes waiting for a new playtime that, probably, will never came.

Now this game is more for collectors than for gamers, but is a beauty and near to "Tolkien's writtings spirit". More than other games that came later.

I found this too complicated, and that it required certain cards that were kind of hard to find to really "complete" the game. Like if you don't have a ton of locations, and don't have the one ring, there goes one of the victory conditions.

If you are really into old man Tolkien, then this game might be worth the investment in time.  It feels like every character in the books is in this game somewhere or other, even those that are mentioned once in passing.  The game is daunting, even if you start off just using the Challenge Decks.  The rules are not easy, and you definitely need to print out the map.  The game is not streamlined in the least, so it's also unwieldy.  Maybe if you started playing the game back when it came out, it would've been easier to grasp.  For now, I think the 10's on here are more for nostalgia or for very patient and loyal fans of Tolkien.  Having said that, I'm okay with playing it once in a while.

Update: Recently picked this up again to try it and it was a much better experience this time. Getting the Wizard's Companion I think was a huge help for one thing. There are still some things I need to clear up and there is a time investment with this game, but I am really, really impressed with how well-implemented the theme is. I lot of research obviously went into making this game.

My first tournament game (and finished 2nd first time out, too!)  As rich an experience as you can ever want a CCG to be, sometimes to its detriment.  I'm still not sure I know how agents work or exactly what stage resources do.  Still, a game absolutely drowning in depth and the world of the license.  I'm usually down in the involvement of dice in a game like this, but it somehow fits to me. Beautiful art for its time.  Hardcore gamers who love Tolkien are doing themselves a disservice by not giving this a try.

RATING: 7
Middle Earth: The Wizards is a well-conceived collectible card game that was definitely a cut above most of the genre.  It's a thoughful game that does a terrific job of conveying the proper feel for its setting.  The game emphasized characters, locations, and corruption in a way that really told a cohesive story - something that you don't often find in collectible card games.  Deck construction was less interesting here than in some of the other CCGs I played, but the gameplay itself was terrific.  The first expansion (The Dragons) is good, but avoid the others.  Even when it was brand new, I had a hard time finding opponents for ME:TW, perhaps because of the complexity and difficult learning curve.  I'll always have good memories of the game, but I doubt I'll play it again.

This was a great CCG that we played the heck out of when it first came out, but later sets there were a lot of broken cards and odd little rules issues that ultimately led to this game falling out of favor with my group.  The rules were a little tough and some of the more casual players in our group never really got it.  Probably the CCG most crying for some kind of re-do or mechanics theft out there, except for netrunner.

RATING: 6
I got a chance to play this game with the Challenge decks and had a pretty good time. It seems that there are foolishly high levels of complexity when it comes to each expansion and the extra rules it adds. Additionally, even though I had a shoebox full of cards, it seems impossible to build a viable deck out of them, and certainly not to build another to play against it. If you had just the challenge decks I think this could be a lot of fun though. The only thing you would be missing out on would be trying to destroy the One Ring. All in all, it has some very fun aspects, and some quite overly complex aspects, so it sort of ends up being a fun diverson, but not something I'd pour tons of money into.

Collection: I bought the five wizard Challenge Decks. Hopefully I'll get to dive into this again at some point. It's like the Magic Realm of CCGs.

Used to play this a lot when it came out. Hundreds of cards have been lying in my closet for a decade or something. I recalled this was actually a nice game and gave it another try.

And I was correct. This is actually a wonderful game. I think we used to play it a little wrong back in the days. Games used to last several hours as people just collected resources never calling the council. I think that's what finally killed the game for us. But when played correctly and competitively this game is really enjoyable. There's lots of ways to build your deck and I really enjoy the artwork on the cards (there are some bad ones, but mostly it's very good). Deck building though is the thing why this wont get played a lot. It takes a lot of time. Especially when you have hudreds of cards. Still a nice game to play when in a right mood.

Memories from the past. After letting go of Magic the Gathering, I fell in love with MECCG (or Middle Earth: The Wizards back then). I haven't played this one for ages, but as a Tolkien fan I love the theme - and mechanisms are clever as well. Every play feels like an adventure. Corruption mechanism is really well balanced!

RATING: N/A
Tolkien es un o de los autores de Fantasía Heroica más importantes del s. XX y este juego parece estar a su altura en lo que a Juegos de Cartas Coleccionables (JCC) se refiere. Es el Cadillac de los JCC: grande y pesado, pero que proporciona grandes sensaciones cada vez que lo pones en marcha.

Actualmente está descatalogado tanto en español como en inglés (Joc quebró y ICE perdió los derechos de la Tierra Meida en 1999). Afortunadamente, tengo una edición fanmade de 1134 cartas con lo esencial para jugar innumerables partidas en pareja, en solitario o en multijugador con la variante Arda..

En una partida cada jugador representa el papel de uno de los cinco Istari (Saruman, Gandalf, Radagast, Alatar y Pallando) enviados a la Tierra Media para luchar contra La Sombra y sus huestes. Desarrollarán tramas alternativas a la propuesta de Tolkien gracias a las cartas que respresentan personajes, objetos, efectos y lugares con el objetivo de ser el primero en completar alguna de las condiciones de victoria del juego: arrojar el Anillo al Monte del Destino gracias a alguna combinación de cartas que lo permita, alcanzar 20 PV juntando cartas de criaturas vencidas o facciones que son aliadas o bien corrompiendo al Istari del rival.

En general, durante tu turno juegas cartas de localización en las que encontrar la mayoría de los recursos, mientras que el oponente puede jugar cartas de corrupción y de criaturas en función de la localización en la que te encuentres con el fin de ponerte dificultades. Por ejemplo, no podría jugar un Ataque de Trolls en Hobbiton, pero podría hacerlo en Moria. En esencia, ambos jugadores juegan con los Pueblos Libres en su turno y como La Sombra en el turno del contrario.

PROS: Me gusta el sistema de gestión de corrupción (conforme un personaje va reuniendo objetos, aumenta la posibilidad de que abandone la compañía. También me gusta el proceso para encontrar el Anillo. Primero, encuentras un anillo (una carta de anillo), luego, le haces una prueba (como echarlo a la hoguera) y dependiendo de la tirada de los dados, puedes reemplazar esa carta por otra de anillo mágico, anillo de los enanos o el Anillo Único.

CONS: La construcción de mazos es algo más limitada que en otros JCC. Si le metes a Frodo todos los objetos que lleva en el libro, es más que probable que lo pierdas por corrupción.

------ EXPANSIONES -----

Los Dragones (Sobres rojos, 1996). Sin variaciones en la mecánica general. permite jugar con estos reptiles en tu mazo para dar cuerpo al juego y aprovechar las habilidades de los Hobbits robando o en concurso de acertijos.

Servidores de la Oscuridad (sobres morados de 1996). Introduce a los "agentes", unas cartas que permiten atacar a los personajes del contrario directamente.

El Ojo sin Párpado (sobres dorados, 1997). Permite llevar compañías de la sombra al mando de uno de los 9 Nazgûl.

Contra la Sombra. Equilibra el juego añadiendo dificultades a los Nazgûl de la anterior expansión.

La Mano Blanca (1997, sobres blancos). Puedes llevar una versión alternativa de los 5 Istari a modo de magos corrompidos, todo muy en plan "Saruman".

El Balrog (1998, no publicada en español). Añade una subfacción de los Servidores de la Sombra, los Balrog, que dependen de la fuerza bruta de Orcos y Trolls. Aquí acaba el juego, y al no tener una expansión posterior que equilibre a los Balrog, es considerada la más descompensada de todas.

To be honest, I never actually played this game at all, though I did try several times.  I think I really need something like the beginner videos that WotC have on Magic the Gathering.  I have a mess of decks and the art is awesome, perhaps I'll give it another go.

I remember this game. I though it was very different for it's time. I do like how you had your main wizard and then you only has so many command points to get other characters.

It developed a nice following ,but in the end it was done under by Magic. The Newer card game by Decipher based on the films was pretty dumb.

Good fun if you can be bothered with the rather laborious deck-building process. As a plus, the game is a finished product after ICE went bankrupt. As a minus this means the existing cards that are either useless or detrimentally overpowered, are always going to remain so.

Finally got around to playing this after reading the rules a couple of times. Once over that daunting curve the game plays quite well and has lots to offer, especially if you love LOTR of course.  

It is a little cumbersome compared to other CCG's but an excellent system overall that is quite involved for a card game. Deck building possibilites are probably endless, I have a ton of cards and have only scratched the surface. 

Combat is a great feature in this as you have dice BUT they are added to your stats on the cards which keeps the luck lower. Tons of special abilities, lots of location based stuff which is cool, and really plays out the WOTR well.

Mi CCG preferido. Estrategias interesantes, arte espectacular. Cada partida presenta muchísimas decisiones complicadas, requiere una gran concentración, conocimiento de las cartas y mazos, anticipación a las estrategias del rival. Es un juego mentalmente muy exigente, los torneos son agotadores. Lo malo es que las reglas son innecesariamente complicadas (a lo que contribuye la interpretación literal de reglas y cartas por parte de la comunidad) y la gran cantidad de erratas en las cartas.

Del orden de 200 partidas sin loguear.

FUNDAS: Las cartas tienen tamaño estándar. Utilizo fundas con reverso opaco para los mazos.

This , along with Doomtown, 7th Sea, Magic and A Game of Thrones

To make this "short-list" is truly a feat!
This game only suffers from complicating itself, needlessly.
A great adventuring concept, nice idea and gamplay, I wish people still played it. Actually plays more like a board/card game in many ways and it is more of an experience than most of the other ccgs.  Truly captures the feel of Tolkien's world and the excitement that lies within (underneath ;)  )

I like the fellowship tree and the terrain based movement. I also find that it can be played simply by having everyone draw from a central deck... which allows us to avoid the deck building issues of CCG. BUT it is pretty complex (we still have yet to figure out what the separate land cards are for), and the issues of rarity cards being far more powerful in balance make it suffer from steretypical CCG issues. I recommend trying it if you can, but don't spend too much money or time on it.

I wanted to like it I really like Lord of the Rings and tried multiple times,but it just never clicked for me.

RATING: 6
The folks at I.C.E. delivered a masterpiece with this series of card sets. This CCG's rules are quite complex, but nicely convey the feel of traveling through Middle Earth while attempting to gather powerful items or influence factions to your cause. The art on the cards ranges from exquisite to average, or even poor. The overall card designs, however, are quite nice. Since it is no longer in print, this game is becoming harder and harder to find. If you find it (or have it) and want to play it, be prepared to put in the time. (My rating is due to the complexity of play, and the time involved.)

RATING: 1
It's a solitaire multiplayer game. It's bad, there is no direct interaction. It Also has the problem of needing a lot of cards in play.

OK, here is the procedure to win the game (^_^). First you must have a normal ring card (ex: "fair gold ring" card), then you must play the "test of the ring card". Then you must roll generally between 11-12 on 2D6. If you were lucky enough you can now play the "one ring" card. Then you must play the "mount doom" card and then you must play a character who is going to bring the one ring up to mount doom. Now let say the travel to mount doom was easy and there was no opposition. What are the odd to actually draw all the cards above and play them  before you run out of cards or before the game ends. You can also consider that some cards, like the one ring, are rare and you might not have 4 copies of them in your deck. I am pretty sure the odds are somewhat around 0.00000000001% chance.

One of the most re-playable CCGs I have experienced. You do however need a reasonably large collection to get the most out of the game.

I tend to just play the pre-constructed decks, which I find quite balanced.

Good game once you wrap your head around the rules. A map is essential for the travel aspect of play. My experience with the game is equal parts entertainment and aggravation. The random die rolls coupled with corruption points have led to some disappointing games. Even so, ICE did a great job capturing the theme. I suspect Fantasy Flight took a number of cues from this game when developing their LCG.

Some thoughts on the different sets:

The Wizards - The Middle Earth CCG starts off well enough with a game that allows you (as one of five Wizards) to romp around Middle Earth marshaling resources as you try to become the Wizard with the most influence over the Council of the Free Peoples as they decide how best to fight Sauron. These resources come in several forms: characters, items, allies, and factions, not to mention you get additional points for various events you fulfill and creatures you defeat in combat. Since the game is trying to simulate the experience of actually wandering around physical terrain and doing these things, the rules get fiddly here and there, and it's hard to play a full game without consulting the rule book at least once for those situations that don't come up very often. Even so, it's a very rich game with lots of different things to do. When it’s not your turn you get to play hazards on your opponent’s characters as they romp around Middle Earth garnering similar resources as you.

The Dragons - This set delves further into the dragons that remain in Middle Earth, as well as fleshing out the Hobbits, giving them more to do, like burgling and riddling with certain monsters. Not a very exciting expansion in the long run, but there are several cards I have a hard time not including in my decks.

Dark Minions - ICE took it up a notch with this one, introducing one of the game’s best resource cards, Smoke Rings, which allows you pull cards out of your discard pile and sideboard. But here they also introduced Minions in the form of Agents. You can now have a hazard strategy which allows you to send Sauron's agents out into the world, attacking your opponent’s characters directly, or just trying to influence away various resources. Again, the rules can get fiddly here, but this new aspect of game play can be very satisfying.

The Lidless Eye - Minions come out in full force with this set. In some ways it's a reissue of The Wizards, just configured for players to play as one of the nine Ringwraiths instead. You marshal resources in much the same fashion as a Wizard player, though many details are different as, again, the game is trying to simulate an experience. A big feature with this set is the ability to attack your opponents directly, rather than just through the playing of hazard cards.

Against the Shadow - This is an interesting expansion. In it you will find additional resources for both heroes and minions, as well as new hazards, to flesh out the game all around. But here I feel is a pivoting point where the game begins to become overly complex. You start to see more and more text getting squeezed onto the cards, and I've found myself bypassing many of these cards as I find they're just plain overwhelming. Maybe if I was able to play the game more often I'd have the comfort level necessary for such cards to be more accessible. In this set you also see ICE's CCG model change in response to the failing CCG market. Whereas before booster packs came with 1 rare, 3 uncommon, and 11 commons, now they appear with 2 rares, 4 uncommon, and 10 commons. This was to make it so their customers wouldn't need to spend as much money to get a complete set. This approach continued into the next expansion.

The White Hand -- Thematically one of my favorite sets, this expansion explores the world of corrupted Wizards, inspired by Saruman's fall in the books. All five Wizards have their Fallen counterparts here. Once again, the complexity of the game trying to simulate an experience comes to the fore as this set contains multiple cards with extreme amounts of text, hampering the flow until you get used to what the cards do. I believe a satisfying familiarity can be achieved with a suitable (read: huge) time investment.

The Balrog - The final installment of ICE's Middle Earth CCG allows players to play as the mighty Balrog of Moria. ICE once again changed their approach to selling cards: No more booster packs. The entire set was sold in two boxes -- each containing a pre-constructed deck -- for $20 each. The complexity of the game doesn't ease up with this set, but if you're still playing the game at this point you won't mind.

Beyond this there were rumors of expansions that explored the Dwarf-lords of old, and maybe even Elf-lords. But ICE lost the license due to the then upcoming movies.

Best ccg ever made if you ask me. No other game embodies so well the middle earth scenery as this one. Controlling characters from either side, going out on quests and traveling through the land and facing creatures or corruption that will slow you done from gathering resources such as weapons, allies or factions is a wonderful experience. You can play with one of the 5 wizards, with elves, hobbits, dwarves or men. Or you can choose to be a villain and play with Sauron himself, one of his ringwraiths or The Balrog. 
The game does have a lot of rules to master and that is probably why it doesn't get as much love. But once you give it a try, you wont' regret playing this game.

This game seemed fun, but you needed to buy so many cards before you could really put a functioning deck together (too many cards required other ones to work, and of course they were never in the same pack).  I was never one for buying tons of CCG packs, so this didn't work out.

Gave the bulk of my collection to Chris Farell on 7/24/06. I kept one pre-con deck. I hope to pick up another and play this again some time. I like the art and the flavor text. All-things-Tolkien appeal to me. Lack of space spurred me to give my cards to Chris, who, hopefully, will enjoy them at least once a year at Origins.

This is well hidden diamond of the past !
I've never seen something like this before.
A card game with RPG/boardgame mechanics !!
You become one with Tolkien's world and even though the first time the rules might seem hard ,from that point after the game takes a lift off.
It has awesome art.
It's out of print and very rare in order to make a complete collection,but you can play the game without having a pile of cards.Grab a couple of standard decks(easy to find even nowdays) and have a really great time.
I mostly play solo.
Also, because I'm a miniatures collector and painter, I use LOTR minis to represent my party and enemies at any given moment over the games map!

Definition of the words EPIC and UNIQUE !!!

Not sure I understand all the comments about complexity. I played MtG for 8+ years before selling all those cards....this is far easier than MtG. I will agree it can be a bit long to play. I will also say it tends to be more of a game than a competition, if that makes any sense. Fun to play regardless of winning or losing.

Have many cards to trade: at least 1 full Against the Shadow Set and at least 1 White Hand Set. Also have lots of Lidless Eye rares if someone needs help in filling out a set.

Would love to trade, but preferably sell. Cards in great shape, I think. I have them in an actual ME card box (maybe 2). They have been kept well (dry/cool) but they've been in those card boxes since I opened the wrappers of the card packs... yes, I mean since they actually sold them in stores. I probably bought my last pack in 1996.

Also have the book that went with them, and I had purchased a few singles when I got them, but I forget which at the moment.

Pictures of all coming soon (I am in process of moving to TX).

RATING: 8
I was initially turned off by the clunky rules and combined luck of card draws and dice rolling, but this game has gradually sucked me in. Now that I've absorbed all the rules and come up with a few streamlining rule variants, this game has become an excellent thematic, exploratory experience. There's also considerably more game here than meets the eye.

To start, you absolutely must use a map, either buying one from eBay or printing a smaller one off. This completely eliminates the most convoluted aspect of the game. Then, I personally like using shared decks for some aspects of the game--Characters, Minor Items, "Quests" (MP cards pre-assigned to Site cards), and Events (Long- and Permanent-Event Hazards and Resources)--but retaining themed deck designs for the remaining Hazards and Creatures. This keeps each game fresh without having to rebuild entire decks, but also allows players to have somewhat assymetric experiences without devolving into the completely random ride that comes when [i]all[/i] the decks are shared.

This approach is somewhat less strategic, as you can't plan a whole deck around going after Rings, Palantirs, etc., but it opens up some more interesting tactical play. Since Site cards are shared, stealing Factions, Items, etc. from your opponents becomes a much more viable, even necessary, tactic. Ultimately, I find this to be the most interesting part of the game. Running around fending off Creatures while you grab stuff, which is all I did at first, was pretty dull. But combining a Hazard strategy to wear down opponents, looking for weaknesses in their setup, and swooping in to steal their stuff at the right time opens up a whole new arena of play. Ultimately, it's a race to get all the same stuff, and it's always interesting to see how things play out.

But enough of game mechanics. The real star here is the theme. Unless you've got the most watered-down set of cards possible, it really doesn't matter how you play this: you will always feel like you're visiting Middle-Earth. From the card art to the Corruption mechanism, items well-matched to their locations, and the overall expanse of possibilities available to the players, everything contributes to making this the most thematically rich Tolkien games I've ever played. Like Twilight Struggle, I'd play this just to run through the cards. Of course, here there are far more cards, which can combine in more ways, leading to a ton of replayability.

Finally, I've never been into CCGs, and I'm pleased to say my above impressions are based on play [i]only with common and uncommon cards[/i] from the Wizards and the Dragons. The fact there are hundreds more cards to mess with boggles the mind. MECCG is no doubt tough to get into, but it's worth the effort.

This game being collectible means the gameplay is fundamentally broken.  The process of figuring out what combinations are better is a puzzle not a game.  Sitting by yourself constructing a deck is the definition of solitary play (a puzzle).

Beyond that the business model of collectible games is deplorable.  It is a form of gambling targeted towards children.  It adds no benefit to the gameplay is done specifically to milk as much money from people as possible.

Rating after just one playing. I enjoyed the experience a lot. It really felt as if I was reading part of the book. The dual role of playing the heroes, trying to collect marshalling points and also controlling some of the bad guys by playing hazard cards on the competing heroes was very interesting and kept me interested in the game the whole time.

In my view, this is the best CCG there is, hands down, and perhaps the best means -- including wargame or boardgame -- to experience the breadth of Middle Earth.  It is not tied to the storyline of Tolkien's novels, but it captures the underlying theme of Tolkien's world like nothing else I've played.  Sure, it's more complicated than the average CCG, but the time taken to learn this game is well worth the effort.

A long-dead Lord Of The Rings card game. Slow, boring, but well illustrated. Strangely enough, the method of victory easiest to achieve (if you have the cards) is to toss the One Ring into Mt. Doom. For that reason, I'd say this game is broken.

No rating as I have yet to play; comments based on "The Wizards".

It looks like a fun game and well suited for solitaire play, an aspect which alone will probably result in a high rating.

One aspect that will reduce its rating however is the Region card.  With a map, the Region card becomes useless and not only a waste of storage space but also a waste of money.  Although they are beautifully rendered, each time I pull a Region card out of a new booster pack I feel cheated.

Talk about an involved game! The deck construction, the rules, the errata, the actual playing of the game is pretty heavy stuff. Still it captures the feeling of adventuring in Middle Earth wonderfully. I'm very happy that I bought a box of the preconstructed decks and that there are a lot of ideas for decks floating around the fan community - otherwise I would never get around putting decks together (imagine deck construction measured in hours - and when you think you're done, then it's time to start constructing your sideboard!)
The base set and the two first expansions are enough. From the Lidless eye an on the game just goes woefully awry.

Where to begin? The game was unplayable with the starter decks, and was uncommonly complicated.

May be my favorite game of all time, and the best tolkein game out there...too bad it's a collectible card game and its out of print (but boxes of wizards and dragons can still be found for cheap).  I stuck with this one from begining to end, and played it more times than any other game I have.  It truly captures the feel of Tolkien's world, and has a completely free and non-linear play. Some may object to the fact that the main objective is not to destroy the ring, but is basically a race to collect items and factions around middle earth (destroying the ring is an option, albeit it is not the easiest way to win and depends on specific rare cards like the One ring and Frodo). The first three sets, wizards, dragons, and dark minions are definitely the best, as the later sets (like lidless eye), while letting you play as the bad guys (which is definitely cool), mucked around with the rules so much that a minion vs wizard matchup seemed stacked in the wizard's favor.  It's not a 10 because 1) it's a ccg, and I realize now that they are a complete marketing scam (although this game isn't determined by make-it-or-break-it power rares, many deck staples are commons) 2) It's hard to teach (though the basic rules I think are easy enough to learn)
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
Excellent basic game that has provided countless hours of enjoyment. Play one of the Wizards and assemble your own party to find artifacts (maybe even the One Ring). This one is great for Middle Earth fans as it incorporates a lot of the art and story from both Tolkien and the old MERP games. Expansions (especially the later ones) take away a bit, but still a lot of fun.

I'm going to start with two comments.  First, Tolkien is one the most important authors of the 20th century and second, MECCG is one of the best CCGs ever created.  I would be happy to argue the merits of either statement with anyone.  This game captures the essence and feel of campaigning in Tolkien's world very well.  However, if your only experience with "Lord of the Rings" is the movies, this game may be a disappointment.  On the other hand, if your looking for a complete immersion experience in Tolkien's legendarium you found it.

Too expensive for me right now, but I am adding to my want list so that I remember to pick up boxes in bulk in a couple years.    
Looking for offers of full USPS fixed-price shipping boxes of cards.  This would be approximately 2,800 - 3,000 cards.  Offered lots need to include at least 185 Rares.   

Only interested in cards from the following sets:  All.

Looking to pay about ""nn"" cents per unplayed (or played but mint) booster (a bit more for starters) [or offer ""nn"" cents per/booster in trade value if trading].  

nn = 51.  

Will bulk trade my MtG cards at 1:1 (1 of my MtG cards for 1 of your cards).

Offers to trade these cards can be combined with cards from other titles in which I am interested to get a full shipping box (but should still have an appropriate mix of Rare cards).  

Not really interested in this one until the starter & booster boxes/cases make their way to the bottom of the clearance bins and I can obtain in bulk.  
Probably not even worth discussing unless nobody in your area plays any more and you are just looking to dump your collection and at least get something rather than nothing (i.e. throwing the cards in the dumpster to make room for new stuff).

--Jan2008-- I don't know that I ever quite got the hang of this.  My wife and I bought a few packs of cards, and the couple times we tried a game, it never made that connection with us.  It didn't seem unpleasant or offputting; far more like we just were missing a few cards that might help things make sense.   Yet this "just a few more cards" feeling happened at exactly the wrong time:  I'd just started to pay attention to how much money I'd thrown after CCGs - mostly Magic, but we'd dabbled in a few others.  And it seemed to us that our return on investment wasn't very good.  So I never did buy those new cards, and the few I have languish, unloved (or at very least insufficiently loved), in the back of the closet.

Another of the games that died in the great CCG glut.  This was maybe the most "expressive" CCG I ever played - I really got the feeling of traversing the wilderness of Middle Earth, finding its dangers, meeting its people, and recovering its treasures.

It sometimes ran a little long and outstayed its welcome, and there was probably a rares-are-higher-quality problem, especially on the hazard side of things, but thankfully neither I nor my friend spent enough money on it to notice.

Haven't played this in 10 years. Dug out my collection and amazed at the scale of the game. I have enough cards for multiple players and styles of decks:
*- one being a goodly wizard doing anything from destroying the one ring, helping the dwarves hunt dragons, raising the armies of the free people, helpings hobbits in the Shire with little adventures...
*- one being a Nazgul (I have all 9 to play with), from the Witch-king raising the forces of Angmar, to Adunaphel sneaking through the lands of men assassinating and influencing whoever she wishes...
*- one being a fallen wizard, perhaps Saruman himself raising the forces of Isengard
*- one being the mighty Balrog himself, storming out of Moria to burn down Lorien...

Have a pretty hefty collection I'd like to sell off. Look out eBay, here I come!

Another CCG that I truly enjoyed.  Unfortunately, it was more difficult to find players for this than SWCCG, so I eventually traded it all away.  Captures the feel of the Tolkien universe better than any other game I' ma aware of and extraordinarily well balanced (at least for the first couple of sets) without undue emphasis on rare / money cards.  With my wife's newfound interest in LotR, I may track down some of this again.

Great game that is weighed down by a few too many rules, especially the difficult agent rules from one of the early expansions. I love that the game was expanded to allow players to play nazgul decks (and even the balrog), but that was problematic, because the hazard card strategy versus a wizard deck was significantly less effective against a nazgul deck, and vice versa. The gameplay was deeply immersive, making it feel like very much like a classic D&D wilderness adventure for each player.

If you stick every item on Frodo that he wears in the books you loose the game immediately due to corruption. 

Corruption is stupidest idea I ever seen in this game! Yeah, sure the ring is bad... but Lembas? Isn't this supposed to be a themed game? I want to smack down Aragon with cool stuff and Narsil but the price to pay should not be Corruption ...

Nice art thoe.

There was a time when this was the only game I wanted to play. However, with it now long out of print it is difficult to get a game together. Also, too many expansions and quirky rules caused me to loose interest. "The Wizards" set (1st set) is the best and all you really need to enjoy this game. This game is wonderfully theme based. If you try to destroy the Ring to win, you can really feel the story come alive. It is unlike any other CCG out there and will always be special to me!

Several attempts to learn years ago, then we played a variant Coleman had put together at BGG.CON 2016

Variant: There were folders, one per wizard, with a bunch of preselected cards from which everyone chooses a subset to start the game. There's also a big deck of shared cards. Everyone's hand consists of a mixture of cards from both pools, with specific numbers from each, kept in face down piles (but you can look at the piles any time). The goal for the game is basically the same as usual: travel through middle earth, collect VP by gathering factions and equipment (we played to 25VP, I think?), resist corruption at the end to hold on to as many of those VP as possible, win!

The game took a LONG time: it's somewhat complex, and M and I (especially I) both were essentially learning the game anew. But it is still quite enjoyable! Need to go back and read the rules, try some preconstructed decks!

A steep learning curve in terms of card games, but a rewarding discovery at the end. This is the most strategic card game I have ever played until now. Beautiful cards and the interesting mechanisms (Jan 2011)

Update : The rules are not so complicated; the region movement of the standard rules need a bit of time to be confortable with. The steep learning curve is in terms of deckbuilding and skillful play. The overall feeling about the game play is a mix between a boardgame and a role-playing game experience! Truly amazing. (April 2012)

RATING: 5
This game feels like you are playing through the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.  Thematically it is great.  You and your company travel the lands of Middle-Earth to marshal forces to defeat Sauron.  Sauron plays hazards to hinder the company.  Each player plays a different company and tries to marshal as many forces as possible.  Each ally or faction that joins you add to your victory points as do some items.  Each player also plays the role of Sauron against one other player.

This is a CCG and you have to build your own deck.  I find the deck building aspect to be rather limited compared to other CCG's.  I bought a bunch of cards, but felt the decks I could build were much more limited than some other CCG's I have played.  I ended up just getting a bunch of preconstructed decks and played those instead.

I like the fact that this game can be played with up to 5 players.  You play in a ring and you play the role of Sauron to one other player.  There is no ganging up on one player.

The game rules are a little confusing.  The combat rules just feel backwards to me.  When you attack, the defender gets to roll dice which is counter-intuitive to me.  I didn't understand the rules when I first played the game in the 90's.  I only recently got a hold of more game material and pre-cons and was finally able to understand the rules.

A terrific Middle Earth game, dripping with theme and having a great narrative feel. However, this is my "peak rating" given several provisos. You need a map, the vast majority of site cards, a player aid (which I had to construct myself in the late 90's), and a sufficient card pool to craft interesting decks. Further, I never used the additional rules (and very few cards) beyond The Dragons expansion. It just got to be too much. This could have been a 10 if it had been designed from the ground up as a board/card game hybrid, and by streamlining the card text such that a jeweler's loupe wasn't required.

RATING: 7
I played this when it first came out, then took a ~15 year hiatus.  The game was pretty much as I remembered. You control a wizard - i.e. Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast - and your goal is to rally the people of Middle Earth to rise against Sauron. You think your plan is best, and you are trying to prove it by recruiting factions, finding items, and defeating monsters. But at the same time, you are playing hazards on your opponent. I really like how the game handles corruption, because as you get items your characters are more likely to leave your party instead of defending middle earth. Men and Dwarves are easy to corrupt while Hobbits are hard to corrupt. I also really like how they handle rings. First you find a generic ring, then you need to do a test (like test of fire). Depending on your roll, you can replace it with a magic ring, dwarven ring, or the One ring (which I don't own). There is just a lot to like about this game if you are into LotR. Although, after playing the LCG, I think the cards themselves in the LCG are much more thematic. In the LCG, each hero has a unique ability that is tied to their character. In the CCG, it is just +1 to one or two checks, usually related to recruiting factions from their home city.

So, as a LotR fan, I don't think it's as good as the LCG, but it's still very good. My wife was not convinced because she didn't like the idea of killing off each others characters. If there was a co-op version it would be a big hit with us. As is, I don't think I'll be able to get her to play. I think there is a solo variant that's pretty good though, so I might try that. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This is a horrific example of how not to design a CCG.  "Pull out the map and trace a route for each party" should not be instructions for any card game.  But if you can actually understand the rules and like the theme, it can be a LOT of fun.  Far better theme than the Decipher Lord of the Rings CCG.  Better balanced too.

One of my very favorites.  I do not know others who have this game, so I have collected TWO play sets each of Wizards and Dragons.  I also have a complete set of Dark Minions and some Lidless Eye, Against the Shadow and White Hand, but Wizards and Dragons is enough for me.

I also love to play this one solo. 

There is a steep learning curve, but there is a great step-by-step quick reference in the files section, as well as a simpler rules set.  The game really does get easier as you play a little and if you just stick with Wizards and Dragons you will have a ton of gameplay.

While I think it may well be a "10" game I haven't played enough to go that high on gameplay alone.  Part of my "10" is the pride of ownership and love of the subject matter. 

Print out a large version of the newest map in the files section and use War of the Ring minis (or pewter minis from Lord of the Rings Monopoly) to mark your companies.

The great thing is that this game travels well. I have a small map with less detail (also found in files) and use cubes to mark companies. Then just throw a couple of decks into a deckbox and you're on your way. Even the rules book is very small.

Also, about deck-building. I bought the Challenge Decks because I thought I'd hate deck-building and knew nobody else I game with would be into it. However, I found myself wanting to have different theme decks.  If you go to MECCG.net you'll find hundreds of decks that people have posted.  So I can put together a new theme any time I want without actually deck building on my own.  (Though I have gotten into that a little). The great thing is that I can give a strong deck to an inexperienced player and I'll use one of my poorly constructed personal decks or a weaker pre-built deck.  This allows for natural handicapping and still provides a great challeng to both players. 

This can be a bit tough to get in to, but for LotR fans it is a lot of fun.

Update: my wife was a good sport and tried to get into this. She loves LotR, but not like I do. She doesn't feel the need to create new adventures. What really killed it for her was the combat. Too much of it, too many modifiers, too many dice rolls. I understand. 

I still love the game in its solo form, but someday I will find an opponent who is willing to wade into the glory of MECCG.




Suitability for Travel:

I have a 1 to 5 scale for four categories (1 is worst, 5 is best) in order of importance:

Portability (the less luggage space the better) - 4
Footprint (the less table space when playing the better) - 4
Scalability (the wider range of player counts the better) - 1
Learnability (the easier to teach non-gamers the better) - 1


Overall - 4

My favourite game set in Tolkien's Middle-Earth. I think it captures the feel very well. Small bands of stalwart heroes trying to gain support and recover items that can help them in the coming war verses the forces of darkness.

Great CCG! Love the idea that you can have a killer deck without that many rare/uncommons. Since it's based on LOTR characters are limited, wich in later expansions are noticable. To me that limitation is a plus (and probably why it died out). This game also has excellent artwork!

Bought purely for solo play. Takes quite a while to get the rules down; bought the Wizard's Companion and trawled through all the rules questions on the forum. Be warned: you're on your own as there is no information on the meccg forums about solo play, only the occasional plaintive cry for help - usually inadequately answered. 

Is it worth it? So far - I think so. 
The gameplay really is quite immersive, more than you would expect from a card game and as a Tolkien fan I love being part of that world.
The beauty of playing the solo variant is that you can really get into the narrative. It is also a bit simpler which can only be a good thing for this game in my opinion. I’m sure the extra rules provide much needed depth for 2 player games but they’re certainly not missed in the solo one.

Presumably replayability will be limited as you’re talking about an experience rather than a competition, however the challenge decks are reasonably priced and contain a lot of cards so in my opinion you’ll probably get your money’s worth. Make no mistake though it's not easy to learn!

Rating after 5 games is an 8

This is my second favorite CCG of all time. The only thing holding it back from a 10 is the playing time. With 4 to 5 players you're talking an all nighter into the morning. Still if you're up for that, it's excellent.

This is a combination board game, RPG, and CCG all rolled into one. The art on the cards is AMAZING. Nothing from back in the day and today can hold a candle to the art. The game play is a bit complicated. Nevertheless, the goal is NOT singular in that you must get the One Ring and/or destroy it. It's an open sandbox.

RATING: 8
Complete base set + nearly all METD and MEDM.  Most of the artwork is good, but some is just awful (Smaug is one example, but there are worse).  Way, *way* too much errata, optional rules, modified rules for tournaments, blah, blah. Just not very tight.

But the core ideas are rich.  Unfortunately somewhat difficult to deal and play (starting company, unique restrictions, site management), but look for the "Arda Game" which is a bit complex but is workable as a non-deckbuilding variant.

A map (either the "real" published one or a number of fan-made ones) is a must-have. This is really a card and board game under the hood.

RATING: 10
Transcendental gaming experience, and easily the most immersive excursion across the Tolkien world of the late Third Age.  While piling on the expansions and elaborate system changes discouraged the "Magic" crowd from paying attention, each successive expansion added real depth and strategic options that breathed life into both the famous and not-so-famous of Middle Earth.  Anyone interested in the "real" Tolkien world(and not the hamfisted screen persona which will dominate the tolkien vernacular for the next thirty years) owes it to him or her self to track down as much of this system as they can get their hands on.  Won't be disappointed...

Not being a huge fan of the Movies:
The visuals from this game (and of course the Hildebrant Brothers'paintings) remain my "vision" of Middle Earth.

Gorgeous Game, that I wish I had someone to play with...

Almost a throwback to 1970's SPI & Avalon Hill Games in complexity, it's simply beyond the scope of what most people are willing to invest in for an afternoons gameplay.

Best.game.ever. Immensely fulfilling, highly thematic role playing with a deck of cards in Middle Earth. The scope is so enormous, it's a wonder the game doesn't cave under its own weight (some say it has). I will never ever get enough of this one. If only it were easier to teach, so I could sway more friends into playing with me. As it is, most of them feel it's too complex.

Easily the best CCG EVER. If you play CCGs at all and haven't played MECCG, then you have no idea what you're missing. The game is "dead" i.e. there is no company to support it or continue to produce new product - and BTW the company's demise had nothing to do with the quality of this game. But there is product out there as well as a (growing?) fan base that still regularly meets for competitive and casual play. This beats Decipher's game by a mile, beats MTG by THREE miles, and beats most board games by two. Get it while you can. Seriously. GET IT WHILE YOU CAN.

Pretty fun and very thematic representation of the times leading up to LOTR. Rules have proven to be very tough, and it was hard getting started with the deckbuilding. Challenge decks to the rescue. Pretty sure that after playing these out, I will start to see deck strategies emerge. 

UPDATE: Having started getting into this more, have bumped the rating up to 8. I really enjoy this game. The Challenge decks are so well tuned, playing them really helps you understand how the game is supposed to work.

RATING: 8
Played a lot of times when it came out. A very nice CCG, really faithful to its theme and allowing for nice deck-building choices. However, the number of rare cards required for most of them was quite an obstacle. Gameplay was nice and the feeling that the characters were part of a story was present (to the point that winning or losing became secondary to achieving what your deck was supposed to achieve - which was rather a nice thing). I would be tempted to play it again if I had a chance, if only for nostalgic reasons.

A very good card game from Iron Crown. The players compile a party of characters pulled from the Tolkien books and attempt to marshal resources to fight Sauron and his designs. They do this by playing Location cards that may contain the necessary resources while the opponent plays Creature cards and Corruption cards to try to prevent the player from completing the quest. Both players essentially play good and evil depending on whose turn it is. The nice thing about it is that Creature cards must be played at valid Locations depending on how good or evil the location is. (For instance, you could not play a Troll attack at the Hobbiton location, but you could at the Moria location.) Overall a card game that is great fun and immerses the players in the world of Middle Earth. (Sure wish they had released a First Age version.)

I played with the old version of this CCG by JOC International, it's was enjoyable because the theme, but it had the same problems of Magic the Gathering, too much expansions, buying and selling cards, not everyone have access to the same cards, and at last you are playing always the same winning decks and strategies, really boring. Great illustrations and great group play (a real alternative instead of Magic with 3 or more friends), with some problems with the turns that could make the game broken or unbalanced. Only for fanboys.

Jugué con la vieja versión del juego de cartas coleccionables de JOC International, era divertido por la temática, pero tenía los mismos problemas de Magic el encuentro, demasiadas expansiones, comprar y vender cartas, no todo el mundo tenía acceso a las mismas cartas y al final siempre se jugaban los mismos mazos ganadores y estrategias, realmente aburrido. Grandes ilustraciones y gran juego de grupo (una alternativa mejor que el Magic con 3 o más amigos), con algunos problemas en los turnos que podían dejar el juego roto o descompensado. Sólo para fans.

A long and complex card game. A lot of expansions and cards. But a very challenging and interesting game. 

I mostly play solo games and am enjoying Fallen Wizards.

I've also purchased the 2 Players Starter Set (thanks to the fellow Geek Bulabula). I have translated everything (including the cards) into Russian and am using it to play with my wife and son. 

While LOTR TCG is a simple walk in Middle-Earth, MECCG is a true journey.

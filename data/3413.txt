Tactical operational. Units = Regiment/battalion or one battery.
Beautiful map and counters.
Colorful units (British, hessians, canadians, indians, continentals, militia, rifles, commanders, rangers light infantry, etc).
The tactical chits and matrix is a little weird at this scale but add lots of fun to gameplay.
I don´t like the Morale mechanic of the series. When one side is backwards in the Moral Table the situation becomes irreversible without recovery.
IMO the best of the Series rests in the tactical matrix and the bluffing in the combats.
A session can be played in 2 hours.

RATING: 7
The game that started GMT's [family=54][/family] series.  The only drawback is replayability: it doesn't have a whole lot.  Since the terrain is so rough, basically, everygame will become a slugfest at Freeman's Farm (how historical!).  The mechanics are solid and enjoyable, but Brandywine and Monmouth are better offerings in this series, and Guilford is the one you should start with to learn the mechanics.

Not a bad game, just way too simple for my taste.  The strategy isn't deep, the combat results can have big swings.  Activation order can impact the results enough to skew the balance somewhat.  Re-playability is poor.

I have played through the main scenario once in a solitaire game. I will comment on the system in brief: It works very well, there are no major issues in play and it flows quite well, with the possible exception of the tactics chit choices which I will admit seem to make less sense in solitaire play, but which I still feel will get boring in f2f play. The problem for this system is I find it a little too bland for my tastes, and I really think it needs more chrome. Perhaps the scenarios in the other battles will offer this. I will give Monmouth a try and see what I think. Nice in terms of simplicity though.

Having owned a few of these, I think them dull and dreary affairs that you would not play more than twice.  At best.  If they could be expanded, past the battles, into theatre campaign games, on a difference scale, of course, at least the replayability would be improved.

Played a game today. I was the Americans and opted for a forward defense and the British had heavy fog and moderate fog on turns 1 and 2. Despite my best efforts at delay and counter punch the British were able to inflict an Army Morale defeat on me. Has anyone won as the Americans in the historical scenario?

Simple rules that suits the game well. Rather quick to play and has a good looking map. The ways you have to take in the game is rather small which make replayability quite low. It will always end up in a slug fest in the end.
Still fun game that has good historic impression.

Not very good "payoff on complexity" - that is to say, it's pretty complex for a game that doesn't have that much going on. Some of the tactical effects seem pretty ourtrageous, the riflemen are vastly over-powered, and the CRT is hugely random. However, the show-stopper is that play becomes stereotyped very rapidly, with only a very limited number of ways to approach the tactical situation (like, about 1). Very disappointing for me and not recommended.

Having played once, it has turned out to be a good game. The mechanics are easy to learn, a little less easy to exploit. For instance, you have to acquaint with the stacking limits that are always in effect, during movement and retreats too; or with the fact that ZOCs are NOT negated for retreat purposes by the presence of friendly units (but remember that ZOCs do not extend into light forest hexes): as a consequence you have to be careful to plan attacks and troop disposition to avoid to trap yourself in suicide positions after, say, the mandatory advance of a successful close combat... Very nice! Next week we'll play again.

RATING: 8
A fantastic series of games...and a compelling battle to adapt the system to. 

The counter density is low, but allows for some larger decisions of maneuver and strategy. The individual leaders impact the battles in a way that feels very appropriate to history (and can be killed as well). The rules are straightforward, but allow for some thrilling moments. Finally, the use of the tactics chits really adds a little flavor, at not much price in added time. The chrome there is a nice touch.

I'm not sure the replay value is terribly high here, but I still want to own the game. Saratoga is a battle of gigantic importance in the American Revolution...and well portrayed here. The reprint with the additional scenarios is a nice touch.

Finally, is there a better set of maps in all of wargaming than the maps for the American Revolution games by GMT? Saratoga holds up extremely well, and lends great weight to the mood of the battle. If only I could smell the powder, it would be complete.

Update:  After playing both face to face and online a couple times, I'm really a big fan. There is a fair amount of luck...and the drms are probably more important than the column shifts in the CRT, which is different than most games. It also can be hard to make a comeback when things start going south....but that's probably just good simulation.

Great little game that deliver much more than the few counters on the board. OK tactical options aren't countless but there's enough to give nice games in a quite short time. I especially like the "tactical chits" to modify combat results.

Benedict Arnold riding hell-bend for leather to poke a superior force in the ribs. That's how my first game played out. And what's not to love about that? (For me, anyway.)

The lines in this game bend and give before they altogether snap, which creates a good deal of tension. Top-notch production values (love those counters) and easy learning curve make this a pleasure to play.

As of this writing, I only have one session under my belt, so I wonder about the replay value. Still, I look at this play as an investment in the entire series, which I will now gladly explore.

Le système générique des règles : de très bons mécanismes simples et avec une grande fluidité. Par contre, je n'ai pas été convaincu par les options tactiques qui à mon avis allongent le temps de jeu inutilement.
La bataille de Saratoga : bataille intéressante avec des conditions de victoire bien ficelées qui obligent les Américains à sortir de leurs retranchements. La situation n'est pourtant pas à leur avantage! Ce qui donne un jeu relativement déséquilibré en faveur des britanniques.

RATING: 5
Reasonably simple system. However, I'm not sure about the replayability, since I expect most games will become duels around Freeman's Farm. Sticking with the historical weather is recommended.

There are definitely some WTF moments with both the combat system and the victory conditions. For example, why is a 1 point artillery potentially as powerful as a 5 pointer? The damage system there doesn't make sense to me. Also, the morale track seems mostly irrelevant, since knocking a player down to 0 morale would require incredibly one sided casualties to the point that a player would probably concede rather than continue if it even got close to zero.

As for victory conditions, why is a captured 5 point infantry no more valuable than a destroyed 1 point light infantry?

I guess you're supposed to ignore things like this and just enjoy the game for the historical experience it provides rather than get hung up on such details, which is fine. Just be aware of that going into the game.

Somewhat limited in possibilities. The best way to play is to use the Arnold or Gates scenarios which vary the battle objectives and conditions for both sides. Components are beautiful and it is a great introduction to hex based wargaming.

The new second day scenario is interesting but a Bemis Heights scenario would have been better.

UPDATE: This game is an odd beast. The Americans are limited in what they can do but the British are not, although Burgoyne failed to control the flow of the battle. The British need rules limiting command and control because as it stands they can bring a greater force to bear and will usually win.

2nd ed:  Enjoyable system and enjoyable game on the 1st of the two Saratoga battles.  (The designer notes, probably correctly, that the 2nd was a foregone conclusion as Burgoyne had waited too long.)  The system has a few flaws, the most significant of which is the sluggish movement rates.  The fastest infantry march speed in the game (strategic movement along roads) comes in at less than 1 mph.  This messes up the action-reaction narrative of the battle, and certain units (particularly the New Hampshire regiments) are deployed ahistorically to compensate.  The other major systemic flaw is that rifle (and artillery) fire has a more moral than physical effect.  Historically, the British won the field but suffered disproportionate casualties due largely to Morgan's riflemen.  In the game, Morgan's riflemen are more likely to make the British run away without taking casualties.  Given the highly disciplined nature of the British regulars, this feels very wrong.  Finally, the system does not reflect the relative advantage of the Americans (particularly the militia) in the woods.  Therefore, Arnold's spoiling attack makes no sense in game terms, so the victory conditions force both sides to fight for Freeman's Farm even though the ground had no strategic value.  Despite the flaws, the game is enjoyable and plays in about 2 hours, but it's hard to shake the impression that it could have been much better.

RATING: 10
I'll go ahead and be the only person to give this game a 10.
Why because it is so Easy to play, fast and fun. What else do I want in a game?? Okay, how about history?? Check, it will be Arnold at Freeman's farm. How about alt-history??
Okay, how about a day 2 scenario? I mean what else can the designer have done w/hex and counter gaming to make this better? Don't like the Tactical chits (perhaps you play solo?) Well, use the provided solo chart or ditch em. Sure it will make the extreme results less likely, mostly at the beginning of the battle when Army morale hasn't cracked, but so what, most fights do start out slow and get more intense.
I just don't see what the problem is? The game is fast, simple and fun, and historical... what are you all looking for in a game if this doesn't work? (comes down off the soapbox and leaves the stage)

Based on two plays only. I really am getting to like the system. Of the games I have played, Saratoga plays quickly and is quite fun. The Americans had no shot in either of the two games, although they do win in tournaments, so I am hoping that the game becomes more competitive as we grasp the system. Otherwise it will quickly sink in rating as the replayability will be low.

Mildly enjoyable light simulation of the Battle of Saratoga.  I like this series because it introduces me to the major tactical problems faced in a number of American Revolutionary Battles.  I enjoy how the importance of maintaining room to retreat compels one to use formations that imitate commanders of the time.  I also like the relatively low counter density and simple rules.  I would enjoy the game more if the CRT led to somewhat more dramatic results.  It's tough to eliminate units here -- I understand why it's tough to eliminate units given the nature of the conflict, but I would enjoy this more as a GAME if this aspect were a bit more dynamic.

Only two games so far. Not a bad game system and the rating could possibly go up to a 6 with more experience. I must say though, I'm not a fan of 'tactical matrix' systems. It seems too much like a pure RPS guessing game that essentially adds randomness to a very random CRT. The tactical matrix more than doubles the time it takes to resolve combats. I'd much prefer omitting it and just giving combats with adjacent leaders a 1 die roll mod in their favor. (I understand that this does not deal with the special and important case of Withdrawal.) I also prefer to not use the momentum chits as they do provide 'momentum' but for a largely random outcome of a die roll rather than much of anything the players do. (Actually, I won't ever play any of the games in this series with either the tactical matrix or momentum rules.)

I've played the Americans both times and have been too aggressive at the outset (I wanted to try out the system). In the first game I resigned in turn 8. It didn't help that Morgan missed every one (of I believe 11) of his rifle attempts, even at range 1 (needing only a 4 on a d10). Did very well on disruption recoveries but couldn't fight worth a damn (even had an Attacker D on a 6:1). The second game went all 12 turns but my play was sloppy and I overlooked important rules.

(How are Withdrawals effected in solo play?)

I like the low complexity and the low troop density. Rules are OK, if a little abstract - takes a couple of games to get it right. It's a good intro for those looking at tactical battles. I have a query about repeat plays of the scenario. See my review. 

What I didn't like was the repetitious nature of the game, particularly the dozens of morale rolls and using those darn combat chits. Solved this by playing two hour sessions x 2.

Played twice solitaire. Interesting and simple rules for the American Revolution. The map is particularly beautiful.

I recently got the 2nd edition. I think Saratoga is the start of a great series. I think the combination of intiative and components make this the best game on this battle so far.

Can't quite put my finger on what I don't like about this game. There just doesn't seem to be enough in the box.

A brilliant elegant system.  Takes a little time to get into but then plays fast.  Beautiful components.  Not sure yet why it wouldn't be a 10 ...

Thanks Santa Grogs 2014, Vassal PBEM game played and another good game from a solid series.  Would love the chance to get a proper face to face play.

This is probably the easiest of the American Revolutionary War series due to very few special rules. The second day scenario looks interesting and adds replay value.

Wonderful blend of playable history. First installment of a great series. Game situation is somewhat limited, but this one is always fun to have on the table. A near-classic.

Excellent system. Counter mix was difficult to figure out as the rules for specific counters are found all over the place. Ordered Germantown due to the fact that I enjoyed this game so much. 2 solo plays none f2f. yet.

This game belongs to an excellent series. Rules are rather simple but enable a good historical feeling without too much brain damage. After two games played I bought the whole series !

Simple, playable game. A clever design with just enough abstractions for its scale. Fits quite nicely with my rather limited interest in the subject matter. 

I played this many times PBEM using ADC2, and managed to lose every time.

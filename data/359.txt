Get past the childish box artwork and here is yet another subtle Knizia design.  The dilemna here is that you want to preserve sets of a single card colour to maximise a multiplier at the end, but you also need to play those same cards to advance bears to maximise the other multiplier.  Plenty of angst in this one as the WRONG bear streaks ahead and no one else seems interested in your favourite.

I have played the reimplementation with the hedgehogs.  Really cool, simple game.  With this point of maquizvelic mechanism that Knizia knows sooo well.  The more the hedgehog advances, the more points it will give.  The more cards of this colour in your hands, the more points you will get... but the hedgehog needs the cards to advance...

Ok game, which doesn't take too long time to explain or play. I had the impression that the points you get depend largely on the cards you are dealt. So no matter how you play your cards, the points you get are determined by the cards you have.

One thing kids like is to be tricked. For instance, I was going to take my little nephew to Disneyland, but instead I drove him to an old burned-out warehouse. "Oh, no," I said. "Disneyland burned down." He cried and cried, but I think that deep down, he thought it was a pretty good joke.

I started to drive over to the real Disneyland, but it was getting pretty late.

So I played this with three players. Two of the other players just decided that whenever I played a card to boost up one of the same color together so they could simply outspeed me and force me to lose points no matter what. Only 2 firemen ever moved on the board.

So it's soured me to play it again. It looked like it had some great hidden depth but I just don't think I want to try it again in case something similar happens. Sold this in an auction.

RATING: 8
A very good game with a lot of angst ridden decisions.  You need to play a card to move a specific color bear, but then you won't have that color card in your hand if he crosses the finish line and thus won't score points for it.  Plays great with kids too.  Go Red Bear!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Not impressed with this one.  If the card distribution is fairly even the game plays fine, but if one player gets a lot of cards for one color, plus some wilds, he can move that color straight up the board without anyone's help and generally score very well relative to everyone else.  Tal der Abenteuer: Himalaja is a much better implementation of this game.

Interesting wee game - the cards you need to play to win the race to the top are the very ones you need to keep to score highly when you do get there - so some decisions to be made, even if it's not exactly taxing.  Over in a flash though which, for my money, makes it a decent closer when your brains are a bit frayed after a more stretching main course.

Unusual game in that you need to get rid of cards when the firemen are low (in anticipation of scoring negative points) and save your cards (at least pairs of ones) for when they get near the top of the ladder. Not something I'd want to play often but it is very short.

Kind of like a game of chicken. Simple filler. Possibly a little too simple for my tastes. I reckon it is a more strategic game than Circus Flochatti but it is not quite as enjoyable. I reckon it will be a 6 or a 7.

One play - as Bucket Brigade:  Another clever Knizia filler.  Has a very interesting hand management twist ... you need to play your cards to move your favored colors up the ladder, BUT only the unplayed cards left in your hand will score.  Seems to be a game about damage control and getting your opponents to do your work for you.

RATING: 6.5
Fun hand-management game for the family although luck of the deal can play a large role in the outcome of each round.  Playing several rounds can help mitigate this somewhat.  Easy for the kids to pick up, involves a little math for them, for now we're enjoying this one.  We have the Bucket Brigade version.

High cute factor game! Players are dealt a hand full of cards, and must play these cards to move four coloured bears down a track, from the forest to the cave. The further down the track the bears move the more points will be scored for that bear. A round ends when one bear makes it back to the cave. Points are awarded for cards of the bears still held in the hand, thus every card you play is giving up a potential scoring opportunity. Play several hands and determine the winner. One of those Knizia fillers that works.

Wrongly often thought of as a kids game.  You play a card to move a coloured bear, but the more cards you have in a colour the more you score.  So the more cards you play in a colour the better that bear will do in the race but the fewer cards you'll have left to score with!  Great conflict of tactics to play with.

To me, this seems like a condensed race/hand management game. It's counter intuitive that your weakest suit card number wise may actually be your best shot at points. I'll need to play a few more times to see what's really there.

RATING: 6.8
A very interesting math card game with a lot of dilemmas.  Do you play/discard cards for which you won't get many points, and thereby giving points to others? Do you hold onto your cards that are worth a lot of points in the end and possibly forfeit a high score because you didn't play them and advance the score marker?  This is a game of balances.  How many wild cards you get is a big advantage and is the luck element in the game.  If 5 people are playing, you know exactly how many of each cards can be played and it is the strongest strategy game.  With 3 or 4 players, cards are removed from the game (as many as 10 with only 3 players), and so play is more uncertain, and you have to rely more on statistics.

My board came warped and the pieces have a narrow base but are tall so that they are top heavy.  They consistently fall over which is extremely irritating.  I am thinking about gluing a chip on the bottom to stabilize them, but I resist permanently modifying and thereby damaging, a game.

Only a few rules and the play is quick.  I like it.

A clever Knizia race game,  I have the bucket brigade, but prefer the original theme.  A good short, clever hand management/stock management race where the cards you play move certain colored pawns towards the finish but then lessen your holding in the stock for scoring.

A surprisingly enjoyable tactical game.  I have to admit I like the bear theme better than the fireman one, but the card art is nice and the gameplay seems identical.  Knowing which cards to play and which to hold back (and for how long) creates a good amount of tension.  I like how quickly the game plays, yet there are many interesting choices to make.

RATING: 4
Don't get me wrong, Honey Bears is a good game and rates an 8 from me. The mechanism is that each turn you play from a hand of cards which will move a certain coloured Teddy Bear towards the goal. When a bear reaches the goal the round is over. Bears score dependent on how far along the path they are and each player scores for the matching cards in their hands (eg 2 points of red cards for a red bear on 3 will score you 6). However I unfortunately ended up with the Bucket Brigade version which I have rated here. It is badly themed, and has weak wooden pieces which break. Why change what was a nice theme around an interesting mechanism. A really great game totally ruined just by rebranding. Well done F2F!!!

A very enjoyable and cute short game.  It's classic Herr Knizia as you must use what are essentially "victory points" on the bears to finish the race.  The more you spend, the less you'll score - but is it better than NOT scoring (or scoring negatives) any of your own bears?    
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 3
Fluffy filler with very little decision making where you spend most of the time hoping your opponents will help the firemen up the ladder that you want to score you points.  Play cards to make them move, score the cards left remaining in your hand based on where the fireman of the color of the card is located on the ladder.

Bucket Brigade:

There's an odd mish-mash of play and tactics found here. On one hand, you're trying to get certain firemen to the top to get the most points with your hand...but you have to use their cards to do so. On the other side of things pairs of ones are valuable so you don't want to use them...and ones might be all you have for a color. There's also the fact that someone might have a massive amount of one color and be able to get gigantic points..I also find it disturbing that so far, in almost 10 games of this, no one has score negative points...

This game is at the same level as Dragon Parade, only with a tactic more.

I've had fun with it, but I wonder how soon it might wear thin.

Terrific filler game. I have the Bucket Brigade reissue from Face2Face Games. The rules are simple, but the execution isn't. You move firemen up a ladder using cards. The ladder has different point values as it goes up. When the first fireman reaches the top, you score using the remaining cards in hand and the point positions of the firemen on the ladder. Trying to hang on to good card comboes and dumping other cards makes this relatively simple game fun.

A game of hand-management and timing. You play cards that determine how far a certain color moves. The catch being that once someone reaches the top the cards remaining in your hand determine the points you get.

Go yellow bear! No, I mean, go green bear!

Love this little pseudo-race game. Interesting scoring system as is usual with Dr. K: the cards you hope to score with are the very cards you need to propel your bear(s) into the best possible scoring positions. Will the other players advance the blue bear, who you're secretly rooting for? Maybe, but you can't count on it. I like the childlike card art too: the walking bears feinting innocence and the hustling bears really working up a sweat.

Kids game.

You play down cards to move bears forward. The bear that wins is worth the most points with the others worth less. You count up the points in your hand. You spent a bunch of cards of a certain color, which gives you fewer cards of that color in your hand.

Sounds good.

It's cute and too clever for it's own good, forcing players to give up cards worth points to get placings to get points, meaning the end result is a bit of a lottery and why bother playing. But, it's cute.

Quintessentially Knizian with the trade-off between playing your cards early to guarantee placement but saving them for points at the end. I find this design a little cleaner than Winner's Circle, Abandon Ship, Dragon Parade and all his other variations on the same theme.

[3 plays]  Have only played this once with adults and also with Ruthie so far. Ruthie was maybe starting to learn some of the strategies. Garrett and I enjoyed it while Barb didn't really know what to think of it yet. I'll reserve a strong judgement until I get more experience, but either way, I can see hanging onto this until the kids are old enough to start getting into it.

Most recent play 5-26-07 with Barb and Garrett.

RATING: 6.5
A Kniza that has gained cult status mainly owing to its rarity and 'cute' factor. Essentially a hand management game, players play movement cards (1-2) to push forward bears in 4 colours. When one has reached the end, scores are tabulated for cards left in hand. A pair of 1 gives a multiplier of 5, and single 2 cards by a factor of 2. The score relates to the bears position on the track and ranges from -1 to 2.

A silly, fun light filler that offers some interesting decisions and an element of risk taking and bluff. Playroom should have reprinted this instead of doing some of Reiner's other games.

Update: Just got bucket brigade. Great quality components...thick cards, board and colourful artwork. However, it lacks the charm and 'cute' factor of the original.

RATING: 3
A classic example of a "you get cards, you play cards, you see what happens" kind of game.  While there are certainly decisions to be made, in reality there is only so much you can do.  There is the potential to be mildly clever, but by mildly I mean just enough to bother finishing the game.  Mostly, I feel that this comes down to the cards you are dealt and how far out you swing on that chaotic valuation pendulum.

A nice idea that just doesn't really do much. This concept was turned into a far superior game in Friese's Megastar.

Now made worse by Bucket Brigade stripping out what little worthwhile theme was there, and changing it to something far worse. At least bears trying to get honey was cute, and kind of made sense. What are these firemen actually doing? Are these "Glory Points" or something?

It's a simple game. The deck has 55 cards: 4 colors, 1 wild color. Each color has 6 1's (walking) and 5 2's (running). You deal out the entire deck evenly (leftovers are removed from game unseen). Player to left of dealer starts, then play clockwise. On your turn, play a card to move the matching firemen up that many (1 or 2) spaces; wilds can be used to move anyone. The board has several steps on the ladder, with the lower half marked with -1's and the upper portion marked with 1's, 2's and 3. The game ends when any player gets a fireman up to the top -- that player gets a 6VP bonus. Then you tally up your VP: the level on the board determines the value of each fireman (-1, 0, 1, 2, or 3). For each card left in your hand you get VP = value of card x value of fireman, with one exception: a pair of 1's in your hand is valued at 5 (instead of 1 1 = 2). Play as many rounds as there are players, with dealer rotating. The player with most VP at the end wins!

The game is fun -- very light, and each round goes by quickly. Still, I don't see why there was so much fuss! It also lasted a bit too long for a filler -- I'd rather just play 2 or 3 rounds even if there are 4 or 5 players. But, another good filler.

(Bucket Brigade edition.)

A lot of Reiner Knizia titles are deceptively simple. This isn't one of them. It might be fun with kids, but I had quite an unpleasant surprise when I broke it out for the first time after an afternoon of Puerto Rico and Hansa Teutonica and found a double-bluff. It really is that simple. :( Not for me.

With the Bucket Brigade edition, it's nice finally to be able to own a copy of Honeybears, which I had only managed twice in the past to get to play.  I like the looks of the little firemen cards and find the game just as enjoyable as when we were racing bears.

RATING: 6
[F2F 'Bucket Brigade' 2007 edition] {Filler; hand management; optimal 3-4p}  BB is a decent and interesting hand management game for children. It is fast-paced, simple, and easy to learn and teach. It's a semi-cooperative game because the firemen will only go forward - you can find a partner if you know which player controls the same color(s) as you. A minor drawback is that it's quite static, which affects its replayability and fun.  Luck of card draw can be harmful, esp. if you have a long run of a single color.

The firemen figures can be made bigger; they're too small. The illustration of the cards is not attractive to children. I like the old theme (honey bears) more.

[House rules] I think the card-passing mechanic in "Hearts" can be used here to reduce luck of card draw and increase information flow.

[House rules] 2-team partnership game is quite interesting.

For a children's game this is surprisingly good.  It's very simple: play a card, move the corresponding fireman; but choosing which card to play is surprisingly hard.  Since cards that remain in your hand at the end of the round determine how you score, there is incentive to hold on to them, but if you hold on to them then the fireman of that color may not get high enough up the building for those cards to be worth much.  There's a lot of luck of the draw but there are also enough interesting decisions and the play time is so short that the luck isn't a problem for me.

I liked the premise of this one, with having to play cards to make a colour valuable, but wanted to hold on to cards to then be able to score that colour.

Alas, in practice it did very little for me, or for anyone else at the table. Perhaps it just needs an extra something; a different distribution of cards, more cards removed (only 3 with 4 players), I'm not sure.

Can't really comment very well on this game due to one play. But first impressions indicate that this game has some similarities to King Me! In that everyone is simultaneously pushing a common pool of pawns up the ladder with points being counted at the end of the game based on the position of the pawns.However, the main twist in this game is that scores are counted based on the remainder of the cards in one's hand. So the faster one moves up the pawn by playing cards, the fewer cards of the color one would have to score. The key is to ask others to perform your dirty work

Not deep or strategic enough to engage the interest of an all-adult group, yet the scoring is sufficiently opaque that kids can't play it on their own.

So the only logical audience would be a mix of adults and kids, but there are hundreds of other games that are better for that population.  The conclusion: This game is good for no one.

Game is very children friendly, and I can see them having fun with it.  However, Honeybears lack any real sense of strategy.  Everyone of course would keep the color that they have the most of as well as with the highest points, unfortunately, that also means the other players will be lacking in it and thus will be unlikely to help with moving the bear of your choice.  Yet there are only finite number of cards per color.  So you see it doesn't take very much to figure it out.

One of the best, most balanced games. Don't let the simple and cute bits fool you...this game requires some tough choices - brilliant mechanic: do I spend my cards to move or save them to score?

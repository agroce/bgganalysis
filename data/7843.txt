I have played these battles many a time and enjoyed it each and every time.. I've just done the GBOH series to death and can't get up to do it anymore.. Recommended found this the easiest to play..They learnt from their earlier efforts and made a great game.

Caesar's Legions sticking it to the natives. This is a great system and has some great scenarios. Rushing my troops onto the coast of Britain, I could hear the screech of the seagulls and the splash of seawater lapping at my boat.

This was my entry to the GBOH universe. Mostly pro-roman balanced battles. Gauls will falter after their Initial attack. Simulates the Roman superiority in Terms of disciple very well.

I find it odd that I see so many complaints about the GBOH line and its lack of 'balance.' It causes me to wonder exactly who it is that convinced some of you people that every single bloody battle from antiquity to present day was 'balanced.' These are historical simulation games, fellas. If you want a 'fair', balanced game, go play chess. :/ 

I've always rather felt that an historical imbalance made the game all the more exciting. So the Romans are overpowering in this game. There's a -reason- their empire was as widespread as it was. Doesn't that just make it all the more satisfying to display your tactical chops by actually winning with the Gaellic forces?  It may not make for great tourney play, sure. But for those of us who are content to play in our own gamerooms, it is more than a little compelling.

In any event, this is yet another rock-solid entry in an absolutely rock-solid system. I have no end of respect for the guys at GMT. They produce beautiful, professional, meticulously-researched games that are exciting and fun to play without being too dry -or- too beer&pretzles. I've got a copy of every game and module in this line and will continue to buy just about everything these guys put out.

RATING: 7
Simplified command rules are a bonus, along with the Marian legions, as the system is a bit more streamlined. On the other hand, the rules are horribly written and the scenarios seem mostly horrendously unbalanced. Although I haven&#039;t tried them with SGBOH given my general aversion to that system, these might be some good candidates given the generally straightforward situations. All in all, not the best entry in the system  by a far cry, but also far from the worst and the playability is amongst the best.

Based on one play of Lutetia via SGBoH rules, but for a Roman and Antiquity history buff what is not to like about any of the Berg/Herman GBoH games?
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
My first GBoH experience.  Complex, detail-oriented game system that seems good for solo play, but of course is better against an opponent.  Like all GBoH games, I don't always care for the counter density and the constant fiddling with tweezers to place and remove extra unit status chits. Vassal module is pretty well developed. 

Hardest aspect to master of this game is the very complex command/leader activation rules.  Hard to master from a rules standpoint and challenging (in a good way) to figure out the best way to employ them.  Conceptually, the rules aren't that hard, but the devil is in the details.  I never got a handle on them until I put together the flow chart posted in the files section....and even now I have to follow the flow chart to ensure I'm getting it right.  Now that I can get the rules right, my favorite part of the game is the challenge of figuring out the best employment strategy for command and control.  I really like that as a battle progresses and the battlefield becomes more chaotic with holes in the lines where units have routed, effective command and control becomes increasingly difficult (very realistic).  There are lot of agonizing decisions to make regarding leaders/command and control (e.g. line commands vs orders, attempting momentum, trumping other leaders, attacking vs rallying routed forces, where a leader's influence is most needed) that don't necessarily have a right answer and heavily affect the course of a game.  Command and control rules and strategy are also very different depending on whether you are playing the Roman or the Gallic side.

My main gripe with the game is lack of balance. Frankly, it is too easy for the Romans to kick the living hell out of the Gauls without being seriously challenged. The barbarians can seemingly do nothing except hurl themselves headlong into battle until they rout because any delay once the battle begins just allows the Romans to rally, recover and attack....and the barbarians do not want to be on the receiving end of Roman attack. I would rate the game higher if the Gauls had a reasonable chance of at least scaring the Roman player and making the Roman believe that he just might lose. I get historical simulation and all that, but part of historical simulation should require that the Roman player be smart with his resources and capabilities to prevail. That said, I'm currently exploring the alternate scenario force lists and rules posted by Aleksandar Pesic in the Files section. So far, I like his modifications.

I just recently lowered my grade on this. I like the mechanics and the subject, but the lack of balance and lack of tactical options for the barbarian side hurt the game. Maybe its me, but I cannot figure out anything to do with the barbarians other than just charge and attack until exhaustion. I really want to have to be smart playing the Roman side and be forced to use their advantages wisely. But you really don't need to. The Romans advantage is so big that all the Roman really needs to do is to be patient and somewhat disciplined on the line and the barbarian momentum will collapse on its own.

I wonder if it would help balance if Roman attack superiority (AS) adds 1 hit to the combat result instead of doubling the result? The Romans should have some superiority, but not too much. Hmmmm....time to experiment.

Caesar wrote that some of these battles were hard-fought (specially the sabis battle) : it's unfortunately not the case in this game.

RATING: 8
After 35 years of wargaming, mostly in the WW1, WW2, Napoleonic realm,  I have only recently got into the GBoH series and I think they are a wonderful insight into wars of the ancient world. All this whining about imbalance annoys me. No  wars are been "balanced". From Megiddo (1479BC) to the current war in Syria ( interestingly, in the same geographical area), one side or the other is always the underdog. If you want a truly balanced war game, try a game of chess.

Brilliant game.  Great counter art.  The scenarios are all extremely imbalanced in favour of the Romans(GMT actually admits it themselves) but they're fun.  The game may not play very quickly, but it's all worth it when you see you see your enemy line fall apart. At Home, not with me at Uni.

RATING: 7
I wish there were a couple battles that were really tense.  As it stands it contains a handful of very one sided affairs and the expansion Gergovia seems to just add another scenario, albeit an interesting one historically, that's just one sided in the other direction.  I printed off the few c3i battles for this one and I'm hoping they prove to be a bit closer.

But for its historical value it stands tall with the other GBoH titles.

Recently added the Spartacus Module and the Gergovia module.  This will make Caesar a more interesting project, I hope.

I am disappointed with this game. The Great Battles of History series tends to have excellent research when it comes to Roman, Hellenistic, and other well-documented armies, but they fall short with the Gallic armies. I think this can be fixed, with enough work.

Most of Conquest of Gaul's battles are pretty one-sided, but I like the system and CoG is an even easier game than SPQR and Alexander.  Conquest of Gaul also has some sea scenarios.

RATING: 8.5
OK, the box art on the 1st edition was hideous (Roger MacGowen was battling cancer at the time, give him a break!), the maps are OK but weak (I always have preferred Mark Simonich's maps over Joe Youst's 'cause Mark's stuff is so much EASIER to read, though Joe's maps are more artistic), and the scenarios are horribly unbalanced - this game is still FUN.  It's a quicker, simpler game than SPQR or Caesar, with 6 interesting scenarios (and 2 more modules if you have any money left).  

Back to the scenarios - they are probably the most interesting and diverse of any GBoH game I can think of.  Three are straightforward head-bangers: Bibrace, The Rhine, and Lutetia.  The Sabis is an ambush, with Caesar & co getting kicked in the pants for a while until they form a decent battle line.  Britannia is an amphibious landing with LSL's (Landing Ship Legion) dropping JC and 2 legions into a nest of angry chariot transported Brits.  Finally, Bay of Biscay is a straight-up naval battle, using an early version of War Galley.  Fun stuff - enjoy!

一个经典的游戏。GBOH系列是古代战术-战役级游戏的翘楚。本作则相对于其他罗马题材要简单一些，更容易推演起来。其中的海战剧本，没有太多意思，喜欢海战还是选择同系列的战舰吧。另外，玩家可以边看《高卢战记》，边推演本作，这将会是一场令人难忘的体验。

My third GBoH game. This seems to play faster than the full SPQR experience. Still a lot of fun though! 
Edit - After another couple of games, it seems a wee bit one sided. Very hard for the Gauls to win, or even get much traction against the ROmans, especially after the initial impetus has worn off. Historic maybe, but perhaps less fun than I first though. Marked it down a bit as a result.

I enjoy this whole series of games, but for one issue - most of the scenarios reflect history too well and end up biasing the individual fight too heavily to one side or another.  It often seems to require an act of God (or the gods, in this case) to achieve an ahistorical result.

Still, it's fun to play for two players, and one can take some satisfaction from stymieing the strategies that actually worked, finding a new way to beat an old foe, or last longer than you should.  If only there were a good way to play more players...

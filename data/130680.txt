Hubby likes this game.  I'm not too keen on it but I have also only played in more Dutch groups so I spend more time translating and trying to figure out the question than actually thinking of the answers.  Thinking of getting a US version.

I like the betting aspect of the game. It adds a little something to make it more than "just another trivia game".

Super fun concept, although the trivia difficulty is all over the place. Doesn't make sense that players are awarded points for simply reading the question.

Trivia. Party game. Needs lots of table space, though.

RATING: 6
An interesting concept.

Being able to 'bet' on how well you know a certain question category is quite fun. The betting format also provides opportunity for some simple strategies to be used which only adds to the experience.

The end of the game needs some tweaking, as it is currently quite weak.

Beats Trivial Pursuit with the betting mechanism (without throwing the dice), but is not on par with Bezzerwisser and Wits & Wagers in the juicy mechanics. An OK quiz game.

Un p'tit jeu de connaissance, ça faisait un bail qu'on n'avait pas eu ça sur notre étagère des nouveautés. Allez, j'en fais un avec vous. Question : "Quel jeu ?" Alors ? Vous trouvez ? Bon, allez, un indice : ce jeu est sorti en 2008.Toujours pas ? Indice 2 : Ce jeu est un grand classique et traite d'agriculture et de ressources. Allez, c'est facile Indice 3 : c'est un jeu de gestion avec des meeples bleu dedans. Alors, joueur un, réponse : Agricola. Joueur 2 :Agricola aussi ? Et vous êtes sur de vos réponses et vous pariez que les autres ont juste aussi ? Dommage, c'était "l'age de pierre"? AH AH AH AH AH

Pour 2 à 6 joueurs pour des parties de 40 minutes environ
Note : Ca ne pouvait pas être Agricola car il n'y a pas de meeple bleu dans Agricola (ce sont des disques bleus). Le piège ! Fourbe que je suis.

iKNOW combineert trivia met strategie. Je krijgt een vraag, daarna mag je bepalen hoeveel hulp je krijgt om de vraag te beantwoorden. Dan probeer je te raden hoe je medespelers het er van af brengen. iKNOW geeft iedereen de kans om te excelleren en strategisch te spelen. Dit nieuwe spelmechanisme maakt het trivia spel uniek in zijn soort. Het is meer dan alleen een trivia spel, en je hoeft geen trivia expert te zijn om van dit spel houden.

Good concept.
Problem is that questions (in polish edition) are ridiculous.
Most of them was too hard even on easiest level.
(Or maybe we just are not very good in "USA tv show secondary actress", "polish cloth designers" and other similar categories)

Trivia game with badly written questions is not a good game...

I am not a big fan of trivia games but this one is not that bad. You can get points simply by betting correctly so even though you don't know that much trivia, you can still not end up last if you bet correctly.

Trivia games are not games, they are [url=http://www.human-memory.net/types_declarative.html]non-interactive skill[/url]  contests, played on an uneven field, which are fun for equally matched players/teams, but usually devolve into which team gets lobbed more softball questions in their weakest category, à la Trival Pursuit. Great for finding the Rain Man in your social group.

I love the 3-step clue mechanism in iKnow. It rewards knowledge rather than speed. I played a few times with the board, trying to guess if other players would fail or not with the "iBet" pawns, but it lacked simplicity and removed the raw fun from the game. I now play it quizz-show style, simple and fun!

Fun game when we first time played it, but after all it's kind of boring.
It is also too easy to get points just by going to the spot 2 (to the middle) every single round.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
I might have played this game wrong, in that it seems odd that you just place your piece as quickly as you can rather than spots being taken by going around clockwise or something, especially since the second spots of the same number of clues are almost always better. This game has the Wit and Wagers aspect of you don't need to necessarily be the best at trivia to win, but doesn't have the restriction of having only number based cards, and I like that the person who is reading the clue has a choice of which category in order to try to choose one harder for the other players. My main problem with this game though is that if someone knows the answer and is pretty early on, everyone is inclined to copy their answer. If that issue was fixed this would become a really good trivia game. Nice components and I like how the chips stack onto your pieces so they don't just go flying everywhere.

RATING: 7
It's trivia with a different mechanic than simply fill your pie and get to the middle, but still trivia, good with fondue and when you're in the mood. The betting mechanic does make it more fun, I think -- there's more interaction between players, everyone has something to win or lose every turn, and it's funny seeing how well you know what other people know.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
FUN: one of the better trivia games as it plays much faster than most and avoids an dice-rolling mechanic.

UNIQUE: knowing which other players might know the answer is almost as important as knowing the answer yourself.

NEGATIVES: some questions are extremely hard where others are extremely simple.

This is the only trivia game I have played so far that I really enjoyed. The designers have found a way to make a trivia game that is not automatically won by the person with the most trivia knowledge, without becoming a game of stupid luck. Big compliments for that!
We first played it using a copy a cousin of mine owns and quickly bought our own version. We have played it with several groups since then, and at least four people also went off and bought their own copy based on their experience.

Ach. I was disappointed by this, which had promised a solution to mismatched trivia games. The gambling elements promised to dispel any innate advantages, but that's just not the case and a strong all-round knowledge will still win.

Unfortunately, I'm still a sucker for trivia games so would always play it if asked.

Simple trivia game. I am awful at this game. It is fun to see what you might know and PAT won, just because he knows how to guess correctly- he didn't even know the answers most of the time. I will play again, but I am not excited to.

RATING: 6
More flash than substance, this Kwizniac knock-off is all over the place with the difficulty (do you know the name of the most famous mountain climber?  No?  How about the name of McDonald's beloved clown mascot?), and tacks on a slick, unnecessary bunch of component crap to facilitate a totally contrived bidding mechanism on who you think will answer correctly.  
I don't hate it...it is just a typical, unremarkable trivia game, of which there are thousands.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
In this quiz game a subject is announced and then you gamble after how many clues, one, two or three, you know the answer. Next you may also bett if somebody else knows or does not know the answer.

I am not too fond on playing knowledge games unless in teams. This has a nice little spin off though.

My favourite trivia game at the moment.
Deciding how much information you want is a great mechanic, but after a few rounds patterns become very apparent. 9 out of 10 times 2 hints is the best option.


EDIT: Plays are a combination of iKnow and iKnow Hitlist.

We pretty much went through all the questions in both games at this point.

RATING: 4
Trivia game where everyone gets the same question, and then can bet on whether their opponents will get this question right or wrong.

my main concern with this is that allows the person going last to piggy back onto the answer of a previous player. Surely there should be some points penalty for this.. Or just make each player give their answer written down.

This for me seriously ruins what could have a great format. Nice question set on the UK version,

I am not a big trivia fan.  That being said, this game at least allows me to use my critical thinking skill to perform decently in the game.  Being able to bet who will know the answer (Of which I am almost never able to answer) allows me to still enjoy the game.  Not something I want to constantly play, but not bad as trivia games go.

Solid trivia game. It goes fast, avoid dice rolling and there's a lot of questions included. It's good to see that this kind of games still get made, as I like to answer some questions from time to time. Betting makes the game goes faster and the components look really nice. Like it.

This is simply a wonderful wargame.  After a dozen or so playings I can attest to the beauty and ingenuity of its design and to the sheer enjoyment it provides both as a game and as a simultation. Yes, a simulation...I have visited the Hendon and Duxford Air Museums in the UK, seen the Operations Rooms with their "tote-boards" (used to show the exact states of readiness of the RAF squadrons) and famous color-coded clocks (used to determine old plots on their mapboards), and until the "Burning Blue", I could only fantasize as to what it would have been like for a controller to direct operations in such an environment. The idea of using a BOARD game (rather than video game) for simulating the problems, challenges and anxiety of the RAF controllers and Luftflotte commanders in defending, plotting and directing their attacks is perfect.

An excellent game simulating the job of the RAF controllers and Luftwaffe raid planners during the Battle of Britain.  A bit luck driven as a game (as a simulation, I think that this is correct), but it generally requires sound tactics from either side if they are to do well.  Plays very well PBEM, if you are willing to occasionally disclose information that may not be necessary (i.e. the content of a raid that looks likely to be involved in combat).

A great game by the same designer of Downtown. This game is a little tougher to learn than Downtown, but I found it to be much easier to teach then Downtown because 95% of the work load is on the German player so the British player only has to learn the basics of how to move and fight.

Pros: Virtually errata free rules.  Fantastic attention to detail.  Well researched and play tested.  The balance between historical chrome and playability is perfect.

Cons: Scenarios and raids are too similar and have led to sort of a 5 game burnout for us.  Even though the variable raids add variety, you still feel you're making the same sort of decisions with the same simple objectives regardless of scenario or raid chits drawn.  As a result the strategic scope appears somewhat limited.

Still, this game is highly recommended.

This game definitely is not for the light hearted. It seems to be an accurate portrayal of the Battle with Rules that are especially well written. The components are also top notch. It does recreate the uncertainity which faced both sides during the battle quite well. And Lee will answer any and all questions with both speed and accuracy.However, game play, to me, seemed a little slow. Partly this is due to the novelty of the game system and partly due to this being the first time playing. Even so, the game dragged a bit in places (like the pre-turns) and some of the redcord keeping that was required seemed overly burdensome. Overall I'd reccommend it but only to my hard core wargaming buddies.

RATING: 7
I find this very hard to rate.  The game is clearly well researched and (as far as I can tell) a reasonable simulation.  The rules are well-written and have very few ambiguities.

The problem is that it falls down as a 2-player game.  The German player maps out all his raids before hand and then sits back doing very little as the Allied player attempts to minimize the damage they inflict.

Perhaps it works best on-line, ftf it is a less than rfiveting experience for either player.

Returning to this comment after playing several of Lee's later games, I am struck by how relatively uninteresting The Burning Blue is. I am generally not a fan of his games because I feel like they generate a ton of work for fairly minimal player engagement. But Nightfighter, Bomber Command, and Wing Leader are all very interesting pieces of design work, even if they don't all come together as playable and interesting games. But in addition to being incredibly tedious to play, The Burning Blue just isn't very interesting as a design.
---
Played, then sold. I love the idea of The Burning Blue, but it's too much process for not enough game. The Luftwaffe player has only a few decisions - where to orbit Freie Jagd squadrons - and even the RAF really only has a couple critical decisions, surrounding when to launch fighters from more distant bases, which will take a while to engage. You make these couple decisions, but it takes 3-4 hours to game them, even for a small scenario. The game should have tightened its focus around the stuff it was really trying to do.

The rulebook is bad but in practice the game actually plays pretty cleanly.

At the end of the day, it's just too much work. I only have room in my collection and time in my life for one of these games, and Downtown wins despite the Battle of Britain being a much stronger topical draw than Vietnam. The game just isn't interesting enough for the effort you put into it.
---
Played once; no rating yet. Crazy complicated, and with a confusing rulebook that makes things even more difficult than the already-daunting 36 pages would lead you to believe - it's got frequent forward-references which makes it hard to develop context, and the cross-referenes are frequently unhelpful. I found Downtown, a game with a comparable rules page-count and arguably more complexity considerably easier to learn and get started with. Once you do manage to get going, though, TBB actually plays reasonably cleanly and smoothly. I enjoyed it, despite playing the Germans in Scenario 1, who have essentially no decisions to make. I think it's got potential and look forward to playing the meatier scenarios - once you get to pull a few raid chits and throw in some weather, the Germans have some legit options, albeit mostly in the pre-game.

Like a lot of these monster-ish games, it does seem like the decision density isn't awesome. You do a lot of vectoring and plotting and computing retrieval times for a relatively small amount of actual action (maybe it gets better as you become more familiar with the game). But it does seem to do a reeally great job of evoking the flavor of the battle.

Anyway, I'm looking forward to playing it some more. The larger scenarios are clearly where the game is, and that'll determine whether there is enough here to make the game worth the not inconsiderable learning effort.

I was fortunate enough to be an alpha playtester on this game. Plenty of things to think about. As an asymmetric game, both players will have different areas to focus on. 

The RAF player must balance his need to stop the bombers (or at least prevent them from bombing effectively) with his limited understanding of where they are and where they're going. Scramble too many fighters and you give VPs away.

The Luftwaffe player must plan his raids carefully, trying everything to keep the RAF in the dark until it's too late to turn the bombers back. Do you use low level raids, decoy raids, sharp changes in course to conceal the true target? Or do you go straight for the target, trusting to your Freiejagd fighters to clear the way?

Great fun for either player, and a wealth of historical information. Really opened my eyes to the possibilities of gaming operational air warfare.

RATING: 6
I'm not sure this game is my cup of tea.  I have only played the "First Test" introductory scenario, so take this with a grain of salt.  The game certainly seems well received on BGG by many people whose opinions I respect.  My basic problem with the game is with the Luftwaffe: it seems like all of the decisions they make are during the planning stage.  At the point the game starts, it doesn't seem like the Luftwaffe player makes any decisions at all.  There is just too much procedure and not enough interaction for a game of this length.  I think as a simulation it probably succeeds, but as a game, it doesn't do as well with me.  The quick start scenarios seem particularly bad since they remove the only decisions the Luftwaffe player makes.  Since it is so highly regarded, I am still interested in trying a full-blown scenario and seeing how that goes.

Wow this is a cool game! There are way too many charts, but there is a lot of subtlety built into the combat tables. 

A huge part of this game is the pre-planning the German's have to do, after which they end up kind of umpiring the game. If that's not your thing you probably won't like BB. 

The RAF player has to figure out this plan, not overcommit, and due to the turn order is always 5 minutes behind information wise. This is one of the more interesting game designs I've seen in a while.

I consider Burning Blue as an "instant classic".
So much historical details are included in the mechanism that you can be scared at first reading. 
However, your first session should change your mind definitively. It is a must have for any aviation fan.
The only drawback is the time investment required and the necessity to play against another seasonned player to enjoy the experience.

RATING: 7
+ Great fun planning and executing the Luftwaffe raids. The detailed thought and analysis that the German player has to put into planning to get the most out of the scenario draw is very challenging. Watching the plan unfold during execution is very entertaining.

- When playing face-to-face, the Luftwaffe player needs to have a plan ready to execute at game time. Proper planning of raids takes time and no RAF player should have to sit around and wait for that process to complete. If playing ftf, coordinate the date/time, scenario and sides to be played days ahead of actually meeting to play and allow (OK, insist upon) the German player to show up ready to execute at the start of the meeting. Not a factor for PBEM.

+ The above makes this game very well suited to PBEM as the LW player can take the time needed to construct a proper plan without holding things up. Can even make multiple draws and plans ahead of time.

+/- Very replayable with the chit draw system for generating Luftwaffe raid composition and targets. However, seems like most raids are heading to pretty much the same areas along the same routes.

- Not good for solo play. The only way to really get the flavor of playing the RAF is to truly not know the LW plan and to have only the knowledge of what the LW is doing and intends to do that the detection and tally rules give you.

+ The above also makes this game very well suited to PBEM as the LW player can disclose to the RAF player only that which he is entitled to know.

+/- Tactical action (combat, bombing, movement etc) is very abstract and could be richer if if incorporated a little more detail. It took me a little while to realize that counter facing (i.e. which way the aircraft noses point) plays no role at all. The game is more about putting fighters in position to act.

- Movement would be better if it incorporated 30-degree heading changes / hex side positioning like Bloody April and Downtown. Would make it easier to discern raid heading based on track history and would lessen the chance that LW player can legitimately choose two different hexes on his flight path, one that allows tally attempt/AAA attack and one that does NOT allow tally attempt/AAA attack. 30-degree/hexside movement and hex occupation rules (ala Bloody April) would fix that.

- The scenarios are somewhat repetitive. Even though targets, Luftwaffe forces, and weather are randomly drawn/rolled, raids seem to head into the same small area of the map dealing with the same weather most of the time.

- The combat is not very exciting. This game could learn a lesson from Bloody April in making the combat sequence more interesting. Although, Bloody April is on a smaller tactical scale than Burning Blue.

+/- Succeeding as the RAF player is hard !! Very frustrating watching RAF interceptor squadrons head home after one combat without disrupting the Luftwaffe escort or bomber gruppen and wondering if you will ever be able to dent that raid before it reaches its target. But then again, that IS what the game is about, isn't it?

The very worst game ever i played, period.
More clearly; this is not a game. German "player" is, merely, an umpire for solitaire playing of brit. (Look at "nightfighter", next designer's design) . Zero strategy for him, zero options to react to brit's plans, zero adaptability to events for him, random absolutely deccisive, zero fun...zero, absolutely. It seems a joke. BGG punctuation system not have zeros...this game is the only zero.
-----------------------------------------------
El peor juego que he jugado en mi vida, punto.
Más claramente; esto no es un juego. El "jugador" alemán es meramente un árbitro para el juego en solitario del británico. (Ver "Nightfighter", proximo diseño del autor). Cero posibilidades de estrategia, cero  opciones para reaccionar a los planes del británico, cero adaptabilidad a los eventos para él, azar absolutamente decisivo, cero diversión...cero, absolutamente. Parece una broma. El sistema de puntuación de BGG no permite ceros...este juego es el único cero.

Rating after 1 play. This is clearly a well designed game. The rulebook, while a bit dense and long, is very well written and easy to follow and many other game designers should take note. The game itself looks nice, flows well, and provides an excellent level of detail without feeling chromy. Probably one of the most well put together games I've seen in a long time.

The downside, beyond the complexity, is that for a scenario of any reasonable size, the German player will have to prepare the raids in advance. Besides that, there is a sort of feeling that the German player isn't much more than a referee, so I do worry a bit about repeat playability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Tentative rating since I've only played the RAF. My opinion might change once I have to do the planning.
Typically any game which involves a GM preplanning and then "mastering" the game for other players is a bit of a drag for one side, but my Luftwaffe opponent hasn't complained of boredom yet.
A very clever package of innovative mechanisms which do a good job of simulating a complex situation with a minimum of overhead. At heart its a game of bluff and devising strategies and tactics based on assumptions, limited knowledge and hefty dose of luck. Sounds realistic! :-)
I'd like to see more of the optional rules made standard since this smacks of indecisiveness and lack of testing by the designer and makes it more a "games design kit" than a game. I hate having to spend the first 30 minutes of a game session discussing what's in and what's out (or first 3 hours in the case of WiF).

RATING: 6
Rating after a couple of games of Scenario 1.  Players either play the Luftwaffe, or the RAF controllers.  The Luftwaffe pre-plans and plots their raids on mainland Britain before game play actually begins, then runs the raids based on the game time.  The RAF player sits in the control room of fighter command, and has to detect, assess and decide how to respond to raids as they are forming up over France.  Do you set up in the air, patrol, try to intercept, etc.  Victory is clever - there is a hidden threshold that the RAF player doesn't know about, and every force committed works against that.  If he blows it, he loses.  Quite detailed and procedural, but fascinating, educational, and fun all at the same time.  Each side plays very differently.  An obvious labour of love, with excellent rules, and cross referencing.  The sequence of play on the back of the rulebook is worth it's weight in gold - in fact I've begun expanding it to include more information.

Amazing game here. Not only is it an incredibly detailed study on Fighter Command and Luftflotte tactics, it is also very playable and exciting to boot. I don't get what people are saying about a long game though. Scenarios 1 and 2 can be easily played in 1-3 hours.

Moreover, the response level is a brilliant way of keeping the game challenging for the British player, knowing he can't throw everything against a German raid even if he knows exactly where it is. 

I also like the idea of moving the minute hand of the clock at the end of every turn, which may seem insignificant, but it really gives a sense of time pressure.

It's also easier to teach and learn compared to Downtown as air combat in this era was less complicated (no EW, SEAD etc).

Grand-tactical scale game of some of the more interesting German aerial bombing raids over England.  Gives a good feel for bombing mission planning and execution as well as the challenges of air defense against such raids.

SPITFIRE!) or something that covers the whole campaign (like TSR/SPI's THE BATTLE OF BRITAIN).  But I find this game very interesting in its own right!

Historical value is unmatched (just like most of my Luftwaffe raids :>).  

A real committment is required to learn how to play this game.  The rules are well-written, but there is a lot to remember.  You also need to plan the session ahead of time, so that the Luftwaffe player can make their plan without a bunch of down-time to start the game.

While it is a great simulation, I am still not sure there is a great game here; the choices you get to make are actually fairly limited (i.e. narrative generator).  If you have a very high interest level in the Battle of Britain, I would say the effort involved in learning how to play is worth it, but this isn't going to be a game that hits the table often.
 
Note that this rating is based purely on TBB as a game, not on my opinions of the designer's antics on BGG.

I helped on the play test - and it was played a lot because it is a rare combination of thorough design research and excellent game play.Tight focus on player roles, limited intelligence and simple but realistic C2 restrictions as both sides try to master the chaos of air battle management.Strong narrative effect - you feel the AARs could have been lifted straight from the official RAF Narrative of the battle.Looks complicated at first sight, but plays quickly - a testament to Lee's efforts to keep the rules streamlined and avoid periphery detail and chrome for its own sake.

Revised rating - due to more plays.  Originally, I had the good fortune to have one of the key play testers visiting in the USA, Tim Collier.

Tim came over and walked me through the first Raid scenario - a Convoy strike. The game was a Draw. A flight of spitfires on CAP bounced Ju88s scoring 1 kill, then got bounced by 109 escorts losing 1. Bombers rolled poorly on the bombing not getting enough points to win. 

Interesting game design - far more intricate than Downtown. Fiddly in many ways, with regards to the heavy use of tables (I'm one to knock tables now am I? ironic I know). Great Map, busy counters but usable. Simple mechanics but intricate interface. A bit more sophisticated than Downtown.

A more ambitious effort for Lee than Downtown. I like it, just not sure how much yet. But I like it more as I play it more.

Excellant simulation, and enormous fun. Playing either side is tense. The players must master real world tactics to win this one. The game creates a very believable narrative. It is obvious from the system and rules that the desinger knows his stuff. Warning, you may end up talking silly Banter while playing...."Monkees on the ceiling, grab your egg-fours and get the bacon delivered!"

Awesome game. At this moment I would probably say that this game provides to me best narrative and is so tense that we usually spent long time discussion these sessions which is not true for many others games.

It shows chaos of these raids great. 

Rules can seem to be hard at first but excellent play aids help to make it click in fast.

It would be an understatement to say that it's rare to find a game that is both a thrill to play and a genuinely impressive work of original historical scholarship, but both are true of TBB.  It captures the feel of the events with great fidelity.  The rules are potentially intitmidating, not only because they are fairly long but also because they little resemble those in other games (including Downtown), but most players willing to dive in will find that the various introductory scenarios and the detailed Sequence of Play aid make ascending the learning curve quite manageable (and enjoyable).

[later] The more I play TBB, the more it impresses me (and the more second-nature the rules become).  It's remarkable that playing the Germans, for whom most actions have to be pre-plotted before the game starts, is nevertheless very exciting and a great deal of fun.  For the RAF it's an edge-of-the-seat exercise in both tactics and resource management at the same time.  And the five scenarios (each one really a set of dozens of scenarios from a particular period of the battle) bring to life a fascinating military historical tale.

I loved this game for providing that feeling of having to harbour your resources and (for the British) the sense of being under siege. Beautiful map. Nice mechanics for handling the availability and condition of squadrons. Would probably work best using an umpire so as to provide a double-blind game environment (VASSAL would be good for this).

Excellent simulation - as such, not always a barrel of laughs in terms of fun-factor, but brilliantly tense and evocative of the subject. Only stops short of the miraculous 10/10 rating for its daunting initial set-up and playing time, as well as a few (very few) fidgety rules which can slow down game play.

Battle of Britain...always a subject that attracts me.  The height and intensity of the bombing are things memorable from all the old balck and white trailers.  And we remembered Hitler did fly acrross the England Channel and attacked Britian, who was never defeated during WW2.  This is going to be a complex game given the designer's past record.  However, I do want to see how he get the same system to this battle.  Maybe a good game with a high degree of simulation value.

A clear labor of love, Burning Blue puts you into the shoes of the operational planners of the Battle of Britain like no other game I've seen. As the Luftwaffe player in particular, you have to enjoy the preplanning state as you attempt to set up the perfect attack. Only drawback is that I haven't found many opponents to play it with.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9
LBW gives the Battle of Britain his detailed raid-scale treatment. TBB certainly looks complex at first sight, but plays intuitively and smoothly enough, just like LBW's previous title Downtown. 

RAF squadrons are mostly one-shot weapons before needing to land and refuel (Pancake results abound), and loss rates seemed much smaller than expected (until I reread some of my books on the subject, as well as the official RAF Battle of Britain diary, which can be found online)

As long as the Luftwaffe player has his raid planned before the actual game day, this plays fairly quickly - we have played scenario 3 end to end in 2½-3 hours. 

Even when the planning is done, there still is a lot to interest the German player while play is underway (especially with Freie Jagds) - and the planning of raids, routes and deceptions make for a pretty interesting exercise in its own right. There are several different approaches to consider: Should I go with one big massed raid, preceeded by a strong freie jagd, or should I disperse my raids in time and space, hoping to spread the RAF response too thin, that some might get through unmolested? Should I go for the straight in/straight out route, or add in doglegs (with the risk of getting lost on the way), and how can I use the weather to my advantage?

For the RAF player the intercept and guessing game will keep you on edge - how to defend against the raids, while trying to raid match and sort the Freie Jagds from the bombers, especially the notorious (in our games) raid on Warmwell from Caen.

I would recommend playing with as many of the optional rules as you can manage, at the very least you should include the rules to roll for reception of orders for airborne RAF units (on a roll of 6, the order doesn't get through) and that vector and patrol orders should include height information. I also prefer to use the "Raids cannot turn faster than 60 degrees per new hex entered"-rule.

Playing The Burning Blue presents some wonderfully epic narratives and curious little ancedotes, such as when 74 (eagle) sqn first took a full half hour to come to readiness and scramble (obviously the bloody yanks had been down the pub, at 9:30 in the morning), took off on their initial orders to patrol Manston at Angels 6, where they completely failed to receive the repeated vectors from Sector to intercept the low level raiders that passed almost directly below them and went on to bomb Rochford. the raid returned by the same route, where the hangover-ridden yanks completely failed to spot them the second time!! 

Or when 601 sqn, running on Sector's hunch arrived over Dover, just in time to tally its hidden target raid seconds before bomb release, completely evaded the fighter escort, and shot down no less than 3 JU-88s (scattering the bombers, forcing them to abort), then turned to tackle the escorts now screaming in, shooting down 2 Me-109s, all for no loss - and only *then* pancaked back to base.

I am looking forward to playing scenarios 4 and 5!

RATING: 10
"The Burning Blue" is THE best gaming treatment of the Battle of Britain and one of the very best aviation wargames there is. Components are beautifully presented and rendered and the rulebook is the best laid out and logically written I have ever seen. Stuffed full of historical research and using former RAF Battle of Britain pilots as advisors for the game, you won´t get a more realistic and truthful gaming simulation. Game play is first rate, generating huge amounts of atmosphere, tension and excitement. Both sides have much to consider (the subtleties for the Luftwaffe planning raids are endless, and the RAF must consider how to respond and with what, where and when) and this adds much to the gaming experience. For a game of this detail it is also truly surprising how simply it plays and how quickly one picks up the rules. Loads of realism but also hugely playable, "The Burning Blue" is an absolute winner.


EDIT: Just coming back to this after a year of no play and I have been frankly surprised at how quickly I've picked up the rules again. Every time I come back to this I am stunned by the scholarship, realism and yet, playability of this game. It really is the perfect treatment of the Battle of Britain. I'd give this 12 out of 10 if I could.

This game positively oozes scholarship from the detailed tables of historical raids which underpin the scenarios to the historical notes on RT coverage.  At the same time it's great fun as a game (at least once you've climbed the learning curve).  Each side plays differently.  The Luftwaffe player plans everything in advance and then watches helplessly as everything falls apart; the RAF player reacts as best he can to the imperfect information presented to him in the map.  Enjoyably tense, either way and it certainly generates a strong narrative.

Nice graphics too.

I am intrigued by this game. I love the concept - grand tactical Battle of Britain - and I love the innovative way it is put together.  I have not fully got my head around it yet - not by any means.  But I am keen to give it more time because it feels like a design that will justify it.  Played a good face to face session recently and have now played a few times via VASSAL - to which it is well suited.  Mechanically very different to my other games and very enjoyable.  I think it works very well a turn a day via VASSAL PBEM - the tension unfolds gradually and then everything seems to happen at once.

May err on the side of study rather than game - which limits its rating, whilst allowing it to hold my genuine interest.

Very detailed, step by step, simulation of unfolding events as German raids penetrate Britain airspace, and RAF scramble squadron in response. Quite heavy to run, but very rewarding.

Solo play is possible, but I never tried it.

According the game map, my grandmother was born and raised in hex 2017, (Farnborough).  She loves to tell the story where the Luftwaffe dropped some bombs in her back yard, blowing out all the gardens in the neighbourhood.  Apparently, the German pilot was caught in the lights and was being fired on, so he just dropped his load and got the hell out of there (I doubt the gardens were a significant strategic target).  Unfortunately, one of her neighbours was killed in the attack.  My great-grandfather was on some kind of fire patrol and had to retrieve the body from the wreckage.

A manageable and visually appealing game about the Battle of Britain.  The rules reminded me at first of SPI/TSR’s ‘Battle of Britain’ appearing a bit technical in format and approach.  However between veteran gamers we sliced through them and we’re playing (and losing!) in a matter of an hour.  A fine effort from GMT as the game creates very tense raid actions of those pivotal days.

We're only on Scenario 2 of this, but it is an excellent simulation of the Battle of Britain at the operational rather than dogfight level. Yes, there is combat, but it is abstracted, so all you can hope to do if you're the Brits is get your planes there at the right height and hope you're not too badly outnumbered. Can't praise enough.

I've had this game for little over a week and it's only now I'm looking to actually play it. the reason? Not because it's too much to grasp but because the artisan behind this has incorportated so much obvious research and knowledge I've been reading up to better do the game justice as well as educate myself about the history. Given that I usually buy such a game for historical interest it says a lot that the designer has managed to take me out of my land based comfort zone and get me involved in looking at an operational air game. The attention to detail of the game is remarked on by people more familiar with the game and the history than I, but for what is a complex game by most standards, the rules are clear and well written. This game will pay me back tenfold in enjoyment with its design ethos and support.If you have any interest in the Battle of Britain and have some degree of wargaming experience, The Burning Blue comes highly recommended. It's refreshing to see a historical game with a thoroughness of research that puts many "professional historians" to shame. Although I'm normally loathe to enter in to flowery tributes this is more than a game, this is one of the best tributes of any kind I've seen to the battle and the participants: I'd have loved to be able to have shown this to my late mother, who served in the WAAF from 1939-45. I'm sure she would have been  quite impressed.

According to the BGG rating system I should give this game a 3 "Likely will not play again" but since few people seem to follow that convention I'll go with the inflation and give it 6, even though I won't play it again (it's been traded already!).  

A professional product and interesting design, but overcomplicated for my tastes.  Low gameplay/ruleslength ratio.  Not counting the charts the total page count here is 88, way past my one game threshold.

RATING: N/A
This game is unashamedly a detailed treatment of the battle. I designed it because I did not feel that any previous game on the subject went into sufficient depth in modelling the fighter controllers' battle. That said, I purposely restricted myself by designing a game that would: (i) fit on my not-substantial dining-room table, so it could not be a wargame 'monster', and (ii) must be playable in one sitting of 6 hours or less. So there was a premium on making the game accessible and playable. The game is certainly at the 'difficult' end of the scale (I rate it a 7 out of 10 on the GMT difficulty scale) but I hope you enjoy the result.

An outstanding simulation game.  I learned a lot about how Fighter Command worked in 1940.  The designer abstracted all the right things and left the players with the decisions appropriate to their roles.

The Luftwaffe player's big decisions are made in raid planning, before play technically starts.  That sounds like a bad thing, but the Luftwaffe player never loses interest while the raids are executed, even though he has no significant decisions to make.  He's too busy gloating silently about the success of his Cunning Plan... or he's trying to conceal his horror at the RAF squadrons converging on his vulnerable bombers!

Finally, this has hit the table.  Thanks to my good friend, Fred, for demonstrating the discipline to learn it and really take the lead in getting it on the table.  
I've enjoyed the game. Everything is here except tactical maneuver in combat.  Games have been pretty quick after the first one.  One took about a half hour.  We're just starting to get into the raids from scenario 2, though, and I expect, using weather rules and multiple raids, that the games will extend to a few hours or so.    

I believe TBB will stay in the regular play mix.  Once you understand the sequence and mechanics, it really all makes sense.  Good game.

Played for the first time, managed to get through 2 scenarios in one session, so it plays quick enough to be easily accesible. The mechanics integrate smoothly, and the clever victory point mechanism ensures that whilst it is historically accurate, it's a good ludic game as both sides have equal chance to win, despite the asymmetry of the situation. Both my opponent and I were convinced in the meatier second scenario that we had lost, and it turned out to be a draw, which was very satisfying. Far and away the best BoB game I have played, and the best endorsement I can give is that I really want to play again as soon as possible.

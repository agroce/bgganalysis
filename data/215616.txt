Played for the first time 5/29/2017 and really, really enjoyed it. The new Infest feature where some defeated monster go into your opponents discard piles is really neat, and I felt the cards were all really well balanced. Never got to see any of the event/transform heros in action, but I imagine they are sufficiently OP for the cost! Very pleased with this one, and the board is gorgeous!

I'm always up for some Ascension, and this is a pretty good set. Unlike other recent ones, this one seems like it will play well with other sets.

This set has a great level of depth and strategy that makes it a very interesting set. The cards are very balanced, and the new Empower and Infest mechanics play together flawlessly. The combination of the beloved Transform and Event mechanics make for a great way to spice up the game. The card art is beautiful and the board is very well layed out. Definitely would recommend.

Played in a tournament at Origins 2017. I liked the unite mechanic quite a lot, and the events are always fun. I liked the theming of this game better than others in the Ascension line.

Ascension is a very well balanced game where with a well thought out and executed theme. Each expansion adds more and more randomness and powerful cards that can make or brake the game, that I don't like. 

I also don't like that I have to pay for a full game with hundreds of cards, plastic tokens and a board that I don't need.

Since I like to combine all expansion I'd like to see extras such energy shards and events sold separately.

Awesome expansion that brings Ascension back to its roots. Some of the recent expansions have become overwrought and needlessly complicated. The goblins bouncing between decks is hilarious and a great mechanic as some of the cards actually benefit from those which means that you have to be careful on how you're hading those out. This mixes well with the base game or by itself. Curious to see how this integrates with the newest expansion.

This one does a good job of shaking up my big money strategy. One of the few iterations of the series where I actually will acquire Heavy Infantry. Love the empower ability!

This is probably my least favorite of all the core sets. With that said, it's still fun!

This deck adds two new mechanisms, empower and infest. Empower is something that is triggered when you purchase a card. It allows you to banish one of the cards you've played this turn. Infest triggers mostly when you defeat a monster, allowing you to put that monster into someone's discard pile. While some of those monsters just clog your deck permanently (unless you have a card with an infest power) others can be put into other player's discards piles as their action.

This version of expansion also includes events and event heroes that can be purchased when the event is in effect.

It seems like another interesting version of Ascension. More plays are needed before I can really say how it stacks up against the other flavors.

Edit: I played this again without the location cards and it was a much better experience.  I like the way that the empower actions allow you to create and run a thin deck.  I like the new cards.  The events almost feel tacked on, and I'd be fine if they weren't even in the deck.

The third Ascension game I purchased.  I would have to say this is my least favorite of the 4 I (now) own.   Contrary to what BGG says, this does not shine at 2P.  I think it works best at 4P where you actually get to see the special "Trial" cards put into play more often.  At 2P, there are games where we finish before ever getting one Trial, let alone multiple.

Two-currency deckbuilders are sweet, but Ascension is flawed in that both types of cards (combat/money) fight for space in the same "purchase" row.  It's a zero-sum problem: each additional monster in the arena means something else is unavailable.  So if you have loads of cash, but primarily monsters are on display, your buy options are either extremely limited or nonexistent.

Playing this new stand-alone has affirmed my bias that [url=https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/129437/legendary-marvel-deck-building-game]Marvel Legendary[/url] has Ascension beat in every category (variety, theme, etc.) except setup time, and even that can be overcome by resetting Legendary's scenarios and heroes every 5-7 games instead of after every session.

However, if you're already an Ascension fan and couldn't care less about other deckbuilders, the freshness of Gift of the Elements (Infest, e.g.) will be sure to appeal.

The achievement is some detail combined with speed of play, one downside is that the game is extremely die-dependent, and I can't offhand think of another with this level of "attribute". Player ability can help here, but it cannot eliminate the problem entirely, so no one should worry about restarting if the current game has failed to gel. The game acknowledges the situation with hit-limiting rules, and for both players "current hits unreplaced" is an instant measure of success. The German army is the more fragile, so you can't attack everywhere all the time. Hits & misses in the opening turns are highly significant, and a second problem is very different units brought to parity in fighting strength by the limitations of the four-sided block, and this in turn is mitigated by morale rules, and others. Von der Heydte often does well, and the Monschau/Elsenborn position almost always falls rapidly. Perhaps the map should have been rotated 90 degrees. Its a 7, but its being played far more than any other Bulge.

LOVE IT! Will play anytime.
Fast and fun Bulge game with asset management giving it extra depth. Elegant portrayal of Army staff working behind the scene to get the front line commanders what they need to succeed!
A new classic system.
The game plays fast once you get the hang of the detailed turn sequence which allows for a lot of interesting options and interaction for both sides.

Block War game with modifiers built in into the block units. Extra dice comes from the assets. These assets are like flying artillery that is really accurate like guided missiles..

Simple game, but the rules are written in a confusing way that makes the learning curve steep on the first and second play.

Beautiful components, average game play.

There is a lot of decision making in this game. Ultimately, however, I feel the game is won or lost over a few crucial battles in those crucial VP locations, and the results of those crucial battles come down, largely, to luck of the dice rolls.

Just played a learning game with Greg(JaggedTech).  Great system translated into smaller battle.  Focus is on battefield command and lots of decision to where to fight and what assets to throw in to influence battle.  The second game ended in German victory but upon review, it was decided that it was a draw since Greg didn't handle the movement restriction properly.  On the third game, I tried German again and this time managed to blow the central front open to develop the Classic Bulge and took Bastonge.  However Greg as the Allied decide to concentrated on the Cold Shoulder around Esenborn and stymied me despite my attempts.  He survived until turn 6 when his reinforcement start to make the difference and then pushed back to wiped out a lot of my ground force via use of the dreaded Air Power.  This was the one we did the least mistakes on and actually finished after 6 hrs of hard fought combat. Rating upgraded to 9.

It is very clever how a lot of detail has been included in a very playable manner through the assets and events system.  Those chits also give you plenty to think about in planning your turn and simulate the shifting momentum of the battle really well.  The use of reserves to exploit breakthroughs or patch the line is also well done.  As the German, suffer agonies as paying an extra MP to move through each occupied area blunts your blitzkrieg.

While the rules are not long, I found them both verbose and lacking in detail (the many rules questions in the forum back me up on this).  Combine this with several innovative concepts and FAB: The Bulge has a bit of a learning curve. Having said that, there are several useful player aids to ease the pain. The map is not a thing of beauty, indeed the low number of colours reminded me of early SPI efforts.  However, it is reasonably functional.  My only real complaint is that block and counter congestion often conceals the important terrain symbols.

I've found the game fun to play with plenty to think about and lots of action (even if it is not particularly fast).  My one caveat is about long-term replayability.  As the German I did feel as though I was running on strategic tramlines.

RATING: 7
It is odd that the famous words of the Nuts! scenario were not spoken during this scenario, which is only good enough to learn the system. There is nothing challenging for the Americans.

The whole asset thing is something I have to get used to. So far a more sophisticated movement system would have been nice. Now units only move at 3 or 6 MPs. This limits the possibilities in the game and the way it developes.

FAB remind me of [gameid=730], but it falls short a lot. Some thoughts:
* Wasn't it wiser to turn the map 90 degrees, with the German sitting on the East Site and the Allied player on the west side.
* There are too little blocks to fill al the gaps in the line.
* I regard the VP system as too straight forward and not sophisticated. Why should the German go all out? He loses a lot of steps and unlikely can hold a foothold an the other side of the river Maas. And if he tries he will pay for it in the second half of the game.
* There is not much to chase after for the Germans on the West map end.

Buen juego con ideas interesantes y bien implementadas para dar una vuelta de tuerca más a una batalla ya reflejada en muchos wargames.

Me gusta la niebla de guerra que propone, el sistema de calidades de tropa, la gestión de los assets (muy divertida) que te permite implicarte más o menos en cada batalla según la disponibilidad de los mismos. Al ser extraidos aleatoriamente, no habrá dos partidas con las mismas opciones. También está muy bien el poder jugarlo en unas 5 horas una vez se tiene experiencia. Sin duda un buen juego de bloques.

En la parte negativa, me voy dando cuenta según juego partidas que pese al sistema de assets, las estrategias son bastante obvias y no conviene rejugarlo demasiado a menudo. Mejor dar un respiro para no quemarlo. También tiene un importante factor suerte en las tiradas y si no tienes el dia, no vas a poder sacar la partida adelante por mucha gestión de assets que hagas.

Much more complicated that a '3'.

With all of the positive comments, I hate to submit a critical one. My regular gaming partner and I have been playing the game for several weeks. It appears that our experience has been similar to Tom J. We have played the Bastogne mini-game three times and each game took over three hours to complete. We agree that the complexity level should be higher than three. One problem is with the organization of the rules. When we need to look up something we can not remember whether to consult the Series Rule Book or the Play Book. While the Series Rule Book has an index the Playbook does not. Since we both have a copy of the game, we each have a copy of the rules that we can use in order to look things up. This speeds up the play some. We feel that the learning curve for the game is high. An example of the disorganized nature of the rules concerns one of the player aide cards. On one side there is recorded a 'Sequence of Play'. On the other side there is recorded an 'Extended Sequence of Play'. We employed the 'Sequence of Play' the first time we played the game and discovered that we were skipping many actions. Right now we feel like we are playing the game instead of each other. 

EDIT: We have just complete our playing the "Cold Shoulder" scenario for the second time. It is a very balanced scenario. Next week we are going to try the full game. We still feel that the learning curve is high for the game. When we played it last night we finally did it without making any mistakes concerning the rules. We highly recomment the FAB Bulge Deluxe Player Pack in the 'Files' section.  It is very helpful.

Initial Impression: This is a great game and covers the conflict very well. I'm not sure that idea of using blocks for the units was due to the Fog of War aspect of blocks or not. I suspect it has more to do with the way this game handles step reduction. Having your units lose steps but become more elite is simply brilliant. I love the asset allocation chit pull system, which abstracts the logistics that I find are unnecessary in a game of this scope. There are some seriously difficult decisions to make every turn and the game feels open-ended with its victory conditions.

Played the intro scenario once so far (solo).  The game mechanics seem solid and most importantly, fun.  The attacker and the defender each have lots to do in every phase.  This makes you feel engaged even when its not your turn.  The combination of blocks for major units and counters for the supporting assets and events is design genius.  I look forward to my next play.  Initial rating a 7.

*edit*  I love the game system but its time I'm honest with myself and admit I don't like Bulge games.

Fantastic wargame with innovative game mechanics, FAB:Bulge delivers the feel of the battle and the time in which it took place.  A good addition to any wargamers collection.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Interesting game this is. I like FOW in block games and this has blocks, so that is a plus. I like the use of assets to enhance an attack or stiffen a defense. That helps create some tough decisions which is a plus in any game. Just some tough decisions mind you. 

However, in some ways the game falls a little flat for me. It might be the subject matter as I have come across many a Bulge game over the years and the battle has taken on a bit of a "seen that before" quality personally. This despite the unique treatment here. That should not be a critique of the game mind you ... rather it is just a personal thing. In no way should that impact your decision to play or not play. One thing that might impact it though is that the "F" in FAB is a bit of a misnomer as I do not think it is particularly "Fast". Sort of a medium in time to play.... no doubt that with more experience this would lessen somewhat as it always does. 

PRO: Fun to have a block game tackle this subject. Use of assets allows emphasis at important points and also, due to their drawing via chit pull, some more degree of FOW. If I were to play a BoB game, this would be it.

CON: Not really all that fast. Not horrible in that regard, just not a real whiz banger. 
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Very good game - mechanics using blocks for key units and battle assets to provide flexibility in battle makes for good tactical play.  I also like the use of chit cups to pull these assets and events to somewhat randomize the play.
Looking forward to more games in this series.

RATING: 9
2012 UPDATE: I've ended up liking FAB more than the below comments would perhaps imply (thus the rating settled in at a 9). It's clever, clean and fast-playing, and doesn't ask you to make any decisions that aren't really important, which is very cool - lots of choices have a lot at stake. Now that Sicily is out I hope the system can get enough critical mass that the game can get enough play to help some of the slightly edgy rules get retained more easily.
---
UPDATE: I think the problem here, to the extent that there is one, is that FAB is over-designed. It seems to me that it was designed as a system game rather than a Bulge game. I'm in software, and we always get in trouble when we try to design reusability/extensibility into a system rather than just designing the system the user needs and letting the reusability take care of itself because we did a good job in the original design. I suspect that is what has happened here, to a rather small but non-zero degree.

I like the game, and have enjoyed playing it quite a bit. But it's hard to argue *too* strenuously with some of the lower-raters who find it slightly awkward.
---
OK, 5 games in or so I've become more convinced of FAB: Bulge's merits. It is a bit too long (Moderately Quick Action Battles? Battles that Move Along OK? FastER Action Battles?), and from what I've seen so far there is a substantial luck element that some may find uncomfortable, especially in a game of this length. And it's tough on the Germans until you really grok the game, which takes longer than it should (for me, maybe 4-5 games) - so play the "short" tournament scenario until you get the hang of it. And like most Bulge games, it's probably as much puzzle for the Germans as it is game. But, if you get past all that, there is a fun and exciting game here with a fair amount of interesting decision-making. Whether it's enough to justify the playtime is an open and fair question, but so far for me the answer is yes.
---
I've played this a few times now and I honestly still don't know quite what to make of it; thus my rare half-point rating. Bits of it are undeniably clever, and it has an overall nice feel to it, of attritional battles and Germans probing for week points and flowing around strong ones. But it's also undeniably a bit over-designed I think, it's somewhat fiddly and not as clean as EE even though EE is more complicated, and FAB is a little more technical than tactical. It's also a touch long; I think a realistic time estimate is 6 hours for the campaign game for average-speed players, and I just don't know if it's going to maintain interest that long. Some slightly awkward victory conditions can leave the Germans playing the last few turns with absolutely zero hope of winning, but without the US being able to score the needed points to force the sudden death victory; that's not so good. Also, the assets are a touch fiddly and there is some gaminess to them that is unfortunate (for example, later in the game the Engineers really aren't that useful for the US, but short of getting them killed off you have to put them back in the cup and dilute your chances of getting what you really want, the artillery; either that or not use them at all, both of which seem lame.

So I dunno. I've enjoyed playing it each time I've played, but I've also felt that we've struggled with the rules needlessly and that the game has slightly outstayed its welcome each time. So I'm still on the fence. Another couple of plays and I'll either kick it up to an 8 (a definite keeper) or down to a 7 (good game but not one I'm likely to play a lot).

Nice, quick-playing block wargame with high excitement level introduced by the event/asset draw at the beginning of every turn and some additional innovations like troop quality that reduces with step losses, and the use of some Area Movement / Area Impulse mechanics reminiscent of Breakout:Normandy. Like it very much, will play with the full scenario next. Rating based on 1 solo play of the Intro Scenario, Nuts!

RATING: 7
A decent stab at the Bulge in a day's play, I think. The mechanics are simple enough to be grasped quickly, but there's enough subtlety in the use of events and assets to give one some cause for thought. It hasn't escaped the traditional Bulge difficulty of fog of war - both sides will have a pretty good idea of what units are turning up in what locations unless the Bulge is completely new to them.

First impressions are that the auto-victory levels are very much skewed in favour of the US (as far as we can tell, an historical German advance would result in a US auto-victory at the end of turn 4), but they can easily be ignored if a longer game is wanted.

Surprisingly complex and "busy" game for what is touted as "fun" and "fast-playing".  Granted, I took that to mean "easy", and even a "light" treatment of the subject matter, but there's a lot here.  The "limited intelligence" aspect of block games is a bit of a pain-in-the-neck for me.

1. Design - block, counters and map divided on areas. All is clean, clear and easy to read. Especially solid board makes me happy
2. Mechanics - play, play and play, and you learn the rules, which are thrown all over in two rulebooks.
3. Play - Sometimes Very Fast Action Battle when achieving sudden victory, which happens lot of times.
Significant luck factor in combat resolution. This sometimes produce odd results. If this occurence is more often, gameplay dynamic may collapse.
Brilliant asset pool idea plus more common mechanisms (area rather than hexes, blocks for fog of war effect) and gameplay time gives very good, playable and fun design. Wish more that kind of (Eastern Front, Market Garden).

I've only played once so far, but I'm very impressed with this game system. The rules are tight and well-written. The game provides a steady stream of decisions. There is room for lots of strategic decision-making, and seizing opportunities. I also think the combat system is simple, yet appropriate.  The counter density is perfect for a savory one-evening game.  Finally, the use of the chit draws works perfectly.  The chits are not overpowered, but the variability there and the economy of spent actions give each player some tough choices.  I look forward to playing this one again, and won't hesitate to purchase the next game in the series.

RATING: 8
This game is an absolute blast to play! The asset system is really quite innovative and a lot of fun. 

I think it would rate it a point higher if the blocks (especially the Americans)were better. They are very low quality and an observant player could use it to their advantage to ruin the "fog of war" feature. Also, I really wish GMT would switch to mounted maps, especially for their shorter games.

After playing a few times the funky blocks don't bother me much anymore. I really don't notice the different blocks, so I do not think it is an issue. I do still wish a game like this (1 sitting type) came with a mounted map.

The more I play this the more I find out how much I enjoy it. I have not really come up with a sound overall strategy, but I am starting to get the hang of it.

This great is a great leap from the pack regarding innovation.  My grognard friend and I found the game a bit too fiddly to really enjoy after just reading the rules and trying to wade in.  Lots of really nice choices for each side.  The production values are a 10 and the rules layout are a 6.  The Example Play helped a lot. Putting all the things together to play easily didn't happen. We kept looking through the rules each phase.  I like all the concepts and how the game should play and will attempt to go solo to make sure I have the game down very well.  I think the effort in learning the game will be very rewarding as they will have follow on games using the same system.  I attempted to put together a Turn Sequence document to help our play through and might put that on the BGG.

I've never played a Bulge game before, so "fast" must be relative to all those old 70's versions of the battle. Or perhaps most people simply play the tournament scenario.

That being said, this is a pretty good block game. Deciding where and how to use your assets provides lots of decision points. The ways in which you can preserve units to avoid taking too much damage is a nice touch.

Things look tough for the germans and I'm not sure about replayability, at least for the campaign game. Maybe sticking to the tournament scenario is the key. It also doesn't appear to be possible for the Germans to actually surround Bastogne, either in terms of time or units, so I think its simulation value is debatable.

Excellent game which has to be played a few times to appreciate. "Asset management" is the key to playing well and makes each game different (as assets are drawn randomly). The flow of assets, however, is not random, but there is uncertainty as to which are exactly available.

Have only played the tournament scenario about a half dozen times solo and the same number of games FTF.

Highly recommended and will soon take the shrink wrap off FAB:Sicily.

Tentative comments on sitting in on an opening turn and wading through the rules. It is certainly not fast nor simple. You are tracking plenty of die-roll modifiers for every combat, and also tracking various chits for airstrikes, oil, roadblocks, etc. 
 
Even so I remain very intersted in trying this out, but it is certainly not as fast-playing or elegant as I was hoping. I'm going to track down a fellow wargamer and get in some further study of the rules before approaching this one, but it looks to be a good bulge game.

I've not been involved in any of the development of FAB Bulge but have played it and it is a wonderful game. Fast paced, with difficult decisions to make for every battle. Rick's got a great first game in his series. 

I've placed my P500 order and you should too.

Quick thoughts on FAB: Bulge:

Everyone has gushed about how the "Assets" design aspect streamlines the game and creates many decision-making points for the players. I agree totally. Just to add that giving players the opportunity to choose when to use reserves during a game turn also gives players a lot of flexibility and adds tension to the game. Managing the reserves is key to victory. I think the hallmark of FAB is that you have a simple game but game play is very flexible for players. Very nice. It's not the involved Bulge simulation that Ardennes '44 is but it serves as a good [i]game[/i] on Bulge. 

It's not as simple as your average Columbia Games block game though. I jumped straight into the tournament scenario. Don't. I think the better way is to play the introductory "Nuts!" scenario for 1 or 2 turns just to make sure you've got the rules straight. Then play through the full campaign. Once you've got the rules figured out, no reason you can't finish the full campaign in 3 hours. When they say "Fast Action, they mean "Fast Action"!

Small peeve: the tournament scenario doesn't give the true "Bulge" feeling because there's no incentive for the Germans to try to reach the Meuse. The Germans will just concentrate on killing large US units and capturing areas near the German border to get his VPs. Another small peeve: the rules on the admin phase of drawing of assets/events could have been written [i]much[/i] more clearly than they were.

All in all, I'm very impressed by this game. I'll be looking intently on upcoming FAB games, especially the Arab-Israeli Wars game.

A definitive Bulge game and great game-system -- and I've never particularly been a fan of Bulge games!  I especially appreciate all the thought that went into rulebook/reference-sheet design, examples of play and the intro scenario to ease grognards into the new system.
The experience and study required, rules spread over two (albeit short!) rulebooks, multitude of options for special actions and relative complexity of the player-turn are still pretty big impediments to introducing it to non-grognard players, however.

This game got me to sign up to auto-order all future games in this series at GMT.

However, Reliable sources say it is a good game if you are a true war gamer willing to invest the time.

I'm still working on the "Fast Action" part.

Playing the German's effectively takes some experience. The games are getting tighter (and more enjoyable), at least through the first 5 turns (tournament scenario).

The end of turn 5 is a good check point to see if the game is worth continuing. Assuming there has not been an autovictory, if the Germans are at least +1 or +2 VPs, then continue to the next turn.  If the Germans drop into negative it is very unlikely they can win. Even at +1 or +2 it is only a slim chance at holding onto just marginal loss by end of turn 9.   The Allies get very powerful in turns 6,7,8.  So powerful that it is likely impossible for the Germans to gain any more positive VPs other than an extremely lucky kill of a large unit.

You really get the sense of "What was Hitler thinking?!?"

Love the game.  Played it ftf a number of times.  What's really outstanding about this game is the timing of it.  Mastering the game means mastering the timing of reserve moves and controlling the order of play.  Another highlight is the depth of choices during combat.  There are interesting decisions to be made during combat about retreat and attack, including asset allocation and abort/retreat decisions.  Players even have some control over what happens during combat besides a throw of the dice, a CRT and what happens, happens.  This is a huge bonus for an operational game to me.

Great game.  Still staying at 9.  Will buy FAB: Sicily instantly.  I have played this a fair bit and would still jump at the chance to play it.

One of my favourite blocks game until now! Very clever mechanics that allow a low density of units, fast and intense play and, above all, fun. I only find two problems: the rules are a bit fiddly, because they are not complicate but include many particular situations, and I find it VERY difficult to win with the German side (but I enjoy trying to improve my performance with that side!).

Rarely can a Bulge game get me excited, but this is one I love to play.  The blocks do hide information, but they almost seem more useful as a way to keep track of dynamic units in battle (with 3 ranges of quality).  The difficulty in attacking, combined with the shortages of fuel, require that the German player be good at the game, but this is as it should be.  The keys to success are (like in reality), breakthroughs combined with envelopements.  Excellent system and awesome game.

One of the better WW2 block game implementations.  Fast paced for a "Bulge" game.  I like the ability to trade step losses instead of retreat = gives the defender more active participation in each turn.

RATING: 7
very enjoyable for some solitaire and two F2F.

not a 10 due to replayability concerns.

divided rulebook (FAB rulebook plus The Bulge playbook) is not as user-friendly as it could be.

combining the blocks with the assets makes allows for a great deal of flexibility to what you can do each turn.

Note that this game is Fast Acting relative to a old-school hex-and-counter regimental-level game wargames, we are still talking an all-day game here.

Great system, fun game, but I can already see that it will not have much longevity for myself and my main wargame partner.  It will likely play out very similarly each time, as the Americans have to pretty much just stand there and take it, trying to emerge from turn 5 as unscathed as possible for the counter-push.  Applied to a battle that was less one-sided (and then one-sided the other way for the last half), I think it will fare much better.

This is a very interesting game system.  The blocks add great fog of war. The dicyness of block games is mitigated by damage control methods available to both the attacker and the defender.  I really like the asset draw and the use of special actions.  Gameplay is tense, with many interesting decisions to be made each turn.  I look forward to other games in the system (I will definiately pre-order).  I think Sicily is the next one being worked on.

Excellent block game. Very nice wooden blocks but a hard-to-read map. Gamerules are easy to understand and the game plays quickly. Lots of decision making and enough depth in the game. Gameplay is tense but runs smoothly. This system seems to work well for other WW2 battles. All the components are GMT standard i.c. very good. Smooth but yet fairly realistic combat system.

RATING: 7
Played whole campaign once. This game was a lot of fun and easily one of the best wargames I've played. The things keeping it from a 10 are the somewhat unintuitive rules about using your assets as the allies and the many different types of movement which were confusing for most of the game. My only other complaint is that area borders were hard track amongst the roads.

I really liked the chit pull asset management system. The ability to assign assets tactically added a really interesting dimension to the game that I think I will miss while playing other games. I found it to be a much more enjoyable way to add dynamism to the game than a deck of cards.

Update after additional solitaire play.  I now see how blocks can provide fog of war (FOW) for the US player.  As they commit reinforcements, there will be some suspense for the German as they won't know where the stronger US units are.  However, the Germans need to take certain VP sites on the map, so the FOW won't affect their plans too much.  Still, I can see that this game would be much better with two players as the Germans have several options of where to make the main drives, and the US player will be stretched thin to stop them.  Also, after a couple of turns, the rules are easily remembered and play is quite fast (for a wargame).

Initial rating based on solitaire play of learning scenario:  Overall, there's a lot to like in this game.  The special actions from  Europe Engulfed are back, with appropriate uses for this scale of action.  The use of the assets and events for allied artillery and air superiority, the German Grief squads and other aspects of the battle is clever and enhances replayability due to the randomness of the chit draws.  The road congestion is simulated with some easy to remember movement rules and the German army borders.  On the other hand, there are some rules that are very gamey.  The use of blocks is good for step reductions, although I don't think the limited intelligence aspect applies here.  (Once the blocks are first shown during thier initial combat, I think they should stay face up for the remainder of the game).  The stacking rules are pretty suspect too, as only two units can occupy an area, regardless of size.  So two divisions could occupy an area, but three brigade sized units (for example, the three combat commands of the 9th US armored division or three regiments of the 28th infantry division) couldn't.  Also, the allied task forces that come as assets just appear out of nowhere, where historically, they were part of the units that also show up as reinforcements in the game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Not that fast, and surprisingly little action for a Bulge game.   Bulge games should impart a sense of desperation and impending doom for both sides, but here it didn't feel that way for the Allies.   Their fate is a bit out of their control; it's all on the shoulders of the Axis player.  I wanted to like it and would recommend that any enthusiast of the battle give it a try.  Great designer, great support.

RATING: 6
(Rating based on one play)

I would like to like this game, but after my first game I'm not sure if I do. The game quickly became static with the last two turns being a stalemate. These turns were also very unrealistic: we started sacrificing assets because we knew the game is going to end anyway so it was better to use them. This resulted in Engineers being turned into cannon fodder. 

Game involves lots of luck - bad dice rolling stopped the German offensive before it even began. Yes, I know any wargame includes a luck factor but in my first game this proved to be exceptionally painful. Luck aside, there are some tough decisions to make.

Rules turned out to be extremely unintuitive. Even during the last round we needed to check some very basic stuff. I think that the rulebook is to blame - it is divided into two separate booklets (series rule book + playbook), which reference each other all the time. This result in a very incoherent presentation of rules. Explanation of most game procedures are spread throughout 2 or 3 different sections. Luckily the index is very good (one of the best I've seen), so looking up a rule usually didn't take longer than half a minute.

Oh, and despite the title this game takes a long time to play.

Not a bad game but I would re-title the series Fiddly Action Battles. For the small amount of units in on the map it takes longer than you'd think to play. There is a lot of chrome and exceptions to keep track of and the assets sub-process takes time.

As an example, the Artillery rule stating each player could assign 2 artillery assets... but the exception being the Germans could only assign one regular artillery and one rocket artillery making 2 AND the Americans could assign 3.... WHAT?! Why did they bother to start that rule with "2"?

A "Block" game with 228 counters? Kind of defeats the purpose? Seems like design/feature creep took over and the developers forgot about the Fast part. 

Definitely missing the "Fast" part of the sub-title, I guess compared to Case Blue it is.

Did I say I didn't think the game was all that fast? :-P
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Good concept, very poor execution: Usually I like block games very much, as most of them are simple, but nevertheless fun and fast to play. Unfortunately this game is none of that. The rules are too complicated, extremely fiddly and overloaded with exceptions, while the gameplay itself is very tedious. When you try to play the game, you have to spend literally hours looking up fine nuances and exceptions to understand, when you can do what. It's a pity, as if the rules were simpler and more streamlined, there would be much potential in this elaborate design concept.

So when you are looking for a good block game on WWII my primary recommendation is definitely Columbia's "East Front II".
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
Quick, relatively easy rules for a game of its scale and scope combine with a pretty tense setting to make a very engaging game. Some minor issues with map readability.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
Rating based on a few plays; it may go up or down once I solidify my opinion.  The current status is, it definitely doesn't replace EastFront for me, but I may still decide I love it.  There's a lot to like here; the things I [i]don't[/i] like are:
- the split rulebooks really bug me.
- I may cut the resource boxes & turn track off my map, and rotate it so that the German player sits [i]behind[/i] his advance instead of beside it.
- although I like the map a [i]lot[/i] more than the prototype point-to-point version, I find the river boundaries don't stand out as boundaries, so sometimes I misread the map.
- essentially one scenario with a fixed setup.  I suspect that's really going to affect this game's replayability for me.
- having to plan your entire turn out during your Admin Phase is neat (so that you know whether you'll need to spend your Special Action for breakthrough movement later, or whether you can use it to add a step to a unit now), but tedious for the other player.

Update: I have a lot of aggression toward the rulebooks.  Seems like to answer anything, you have to look in three places, and the second place is in the [i]other[/i] book.  Repeating (or referring to) rules in the places you're likely to be looking for them (e.g. how to handle morale checks for assets in 9.4) would have made the rulebook longer, but greatly reduced search time during play, which is more important.

Update: well... this is a seriously tense game, but one of the slowest-playing games I own (which wouldn't bother me if "Fast Action" weren't right in the name).  I'm repeatedly irritated by the lack of cross-referencing in the rules, and by the number of weird exceptions which have to be tracked down during play.  I'm leaving this an 8 for now, because I would like to play this a couple more times, but I expect my rating to drop off after that.

2009-10-31: Dropping this to a 6, as it's just not getting played.  I feel like there are alternatives ([gameid=84], [gameid=21414]) which offer the same level of tension with fewer rules and faster play.

Excellent game. It all starts with the system. Blocks, with chit pull "event". There is a simple matrix for combat. Low counter density. Unlike Tigers in the Mist where the game is too German biased, in THE GAME i played supervised by Rick Young, There was a Bulge, then it stopped. We had to go th efull 9 turns in order to determined the winner, altho the US win was clinched on turn 8. One of the great pleasure of this game for the German is auto win, the game will reward creativity and agressiveness. You can't go all out, without checking your flank but it will reward boldness.  Random chit pull gives historical flavor as well as uncertainty.Replay value is not so great since it relies on the battle. 

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I am generally not a fan of WWII games, especially battle games, but I really enjoy this one and I can point to one mechanism that explains my enjoyment: the asset system.  It works so smoothly providing each player with a limited set of assets to support their on board operations each turn.  This provides just the right balance of uncertainty and control to give this game a very realistic feel, and it does so simply and elegantly.  A very rare achieviement in wargame design.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8
I am liking the system better now after playing it out a few times. For some reason it seemed more opaque when I was first looking through the rules but it is actually pretty reasonable. Combat system is interesting with everyone starting out at 50/50 odds until you start applying modifiers for assets (artillery, engineers, garrisons), armor vs. infantry, terrain for the defender, and troop quality. Then it is all about attrition and forcing your opponent to spread thin or defend against overwhelming odds and retreat. Applying hits is also an interesting aspect of the game... after applying first hit to the point unit (or field works if defender) attacker can chose to abort the attack and become disordered, or if defender can avoid hit to be disordered or retreat. Anyway I am warming up to this.

update: okay maybe it was the good Belgium beer... but the game definitely warmed up with me. Although the event/chit picks keep things varied each game to game not sure how long it will live... but then again who does.

An unusual and interesting game which has a lot to recommend it, in particular the inventive ways in which it integrates small unit actions and events into a more standard wargame framework. The trouble is that it isn't "fast". It might look relatively simple for an in-depth wargame but the rules are convoluted with multiple sub-steps that need to be executed precisely in the right order and manner for the game to be effective. That makes the game a lot more complex than it looks, and slows it down too, so if you came here looking for an "introductory" wargame, you'll be disappointed.

Purchased at BGG.CON 2008, because of the topic. 

I'm not going to give it a 10 after just one play, but I have to say WOW! Very good game! Tense, close, with lots of decisions, manageable unit density, great ebb and flow of the battle, innovative command, control and asset utilization. Nicely done all around.

A stunningly innovative system that leaves the old fashioned hex and counter games eating dust. Fast moving, easy to get into and utterly involving. Only let down is perhaps the slightly niggly supply system that can be hard to keep track of due to lack of control counters. Apart from that, this is as fresh a wargame design as you are likely to find, and I can't wait to see what this series produces next. I need to learn how to play the Germans better.

I was pretty blown away with the system. It's very fast and very smooth. The rules are not too difficult to learn, and since it's a series game, the additonal games will be much easier to pick up and play. The germans have it very tough in the tournament scenario since they need a VP swing by the end of turn 4, which looked easier to get then it actually was.

Quibbles first:  for a game built around being fast and accessible, FAB is a bit fiddly for my tastes, with the Events and Assets that aren't exactly explained all that well at start.  There are simply a lot of counters to arganize and move into different boxes that I think could have been better handled as cards, but then we would be in CC:E territory.  I'm also not crazy about the map: because of the number of blocks and chits placed in the areas, the terrain symbols and even the names get covered up all too easily (why couldn't the areas have been colored for terrain?) Also, the whole game places a supreme importance on bridges, but the road crossings are very thin and the Blown Bridges counters are larger, so you end up with a mess of counters all over the map that can cause confusion even if there isn't a slip-up. And--this is a very personal opinion--the Ardennes battle seems to me to be more of a puzzle game a la Boney at Marengo: win and you've got it.  There doesn't seem to be many really different tactics that you can apply (but then I've only played the U.S. in two scenarios.) Lastly, the exploitation and "momentum advances" seem almost too hard to create.

On the other hand, I LOVE the retreat rules and there are a lot of elegant innovations here.  I look very much forward to the designer's Sicily expansion.  It's a game that I like and have admiration for, but like EE, I'm not sold on it yet.  Either I'm not seeing the spark, or there just isn't one.

RATING: 7.5
Solid game with high-quality components and well-written rules.  The name is a bit deceiving - I didn't find play to be particularly fast.
My first block game. As a solo war gamer, the entire 'hidden' aspect of the game was lost to me.  Since this is a crucial aspect of the FAB series, got rid of it.  
Much better, I'm sure, as a 2-person game.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Do not confuse "Fast Action" with "easy to get into" or "plays quickly." FAB: Bulge is more complex than the "3" rating on the back of the box.  I'd give it a medium complexity rating because the sequence-of-play is lengthy, interactive, procedure heavy, and there are a lot of little rules to remember.  However, the actual mechanics are pretty easy to grasp.  Each player pulls event & asset counters out of their cup twice per turn then must decide when and how to use them.  With all of the options available to players, and the interactive sequence-of-play, players can suffer from "paralysis analysis." Once you get the hang of it, the game is "fab" and plays smoothly.  

In all, the FAB system is a rich, fun system but it will not hit my table often due to the game's length (the short scenario that I played on 11/29/2008 took 7 1/2 hours to complete).

I like block games, as they are essentially games of maneuver where the key decisions are when and where to accept battle with how much forces for how long. This fits perfectly with the hidden information inherent in the block mechanic and the only detriment for my personally is, that I am not a big fan of hidden information games generally. Plus the block mechanic can begin to feel generic as it gets applied to more and more battles and campaigns. But it all works fine in this game hence the rating.

RATING: 7
Not understanding the hype on this one?  The resource "asset" allocation component is nice as it forces players to really decide what sectors of the front are critical. It's an OK game but certainly not "fast."  Can take several hours to play.  Even after a few learning experiences it takes many hours to complete.  A bit of a let down as the war gaming genre can definitely use something (fast!) to compete against those 60-90 minute Euros that seem to dominate most gaming group evenings.  This isn't it.

RATING: 9
It's quick to learn, though a bit more complex than my favourite block game "Hammer of the Scots". Terrain has a big effect on battles, being especially favourable for the defender. The blocks can also change quality through taking step-losses, so an elite unit taking a step-loss may become veteran, similar to A and B blocks in Hammer, except that the order of combat is not determined by quality - green defenders still fire before elite attackers, but with a hefty minus to their dice-roll. 

Things I really liked were :-

(a) the speed of the game - for someone who has played Wacht am Rhein and Ardennes 44, getting to Bastogne as the Germans on turn 2 was a real shock, but as the early turns each represent a day instead of the normal 2-3 turns per day, I suppose this is about right. (Note, I didn't actually take Bastogne, in a great display of tactical ineptness). Even though it's fast, it still feels like you have to make the same tough choices as the participants.

(b) the random draw of assets such as artillery and reinforcements which then go back into the draw mix after you've used them. Assets such as artillery can be committed to important battles, but, of course, as the German, you never have enough of them, and they get less as the game goes on because you have to discard one artillery unit per turn.

(c) the Germans start off with 5 fuel assets, but every time a unit "strat moves" (typically to get from the rear areas to the front line) or an armour unit uses more than 3 MPs, then the fuel asset goes back into the draw mix, and may possibly not be drawn again.

(d) events and special command actions are also in the draw mix. I used one such special action to gain a breakthrough combat with an armoured division, which really took the allied line apart. Again, there never seems to be enough of these special actions when you need them.

(e) the German's get to draw less and less assets as the game goes on, which realistically simulates them running out of ammo, troops and fuel, all in an easy to administer sytem.

We got the rules off fairly quickly, but the tactical options and correct use of assets mean that there's going to be a lot of plays in this one - GMT does it again!

I'm playing my first game. Really like it. There's not a lot of rules (about 10 pages) but it seems that there's a lot of things we can do (special actions, assets/events, engineer) and things to consider (supply line, use of fuel for the Germans, army group area of operation limits).

[floatleft][ImageID=370092][/floatleft][floatright][ImageID=277095][/floatright]FAB: The Bulge was my introduction to block wargames. The Bulge reenacts its name sake the Battle of the Bulge pitting the under-supplied German forces against the unprepared Americans. The German player must brutalize the American player as quickly as possibly before the Americans receive reinforcements and their victory point incentives become reduced. With only one play of FAB: The Bulge I am hooked. The game is amazing. I have some concerns about the fiddly special rules but this is only a minor complaint. FAB: The Bulge makes me want to try other block wargames such as [thing=6205][/thing] and [thing=68260][/thing].

After my first full game I can find many things to like about this game. The combat resolution is great in that it allows the attacker to simply abort the attack if the defender scores multiple hits. This is a delicious decision point for the Germans as they need to press forward as quickly as possible but if they take that damage they may not have the resources available to continue the attack on a future turn. The scheduled reinforcements combined with chit draw elegantly walks the line between historical results and handcuffing strategy. Very much looking forward to playing again, first game took 6+ hours but I'm certain it will be quicker next time.

Gary Sax's review put this on my radar. Reading the rules, I thought they were fairly straightforward, but I didn't really get a feel for how they'd work. I haven't played a block wargame as of writing this, but I've had no trouble imagining what kind of considerations go into HotS and Crusader Rex. There I felt a sense of interest and even excitement to play the game, but here, nothing much. Troop quality being tied to block status is a good idea. I like the map being divided into areas instead of hexes. I like the chit pull for assets and events. And the asset tiles is an interesting idea. Didn't get a sense of excitement though.

RATING: 10
The asset system works well to simulate corps and army level decisions of where to direct corps and army-level artillery and engineers.  The random draw of assets m ake each turn and each game different and provides a limited fog of war effect in that you're not even sure of how many of your support units will be available each player turn. 

Will the 10SS PzD or the 11PzD be released this turn?  Will the weather clear so Allied airpower will be available?  Neither friend nor foe can predict.

Criticisms on the geek seemed true the first time I played but by the end of game one, I "got" the system.  Play the intro scenario.  I never do that but on this game I did and it really helps.

Folks say the FAB:B is sloooow.  It seems that way to start but by the end of your first game you know the firing modifiers so the action flies.  My next game sped right along.

Folks complain that the system seems "odd" and non-intuitive.  It initially seemed that way to me but again, after the first game, it seems very comfortable and simulates some pretty complicated battlefield limitations and choices with subtle, uncomplicated rules.

So don't believe your initial feeling of strangeness,  Hey, sex felt odd and clumsy the first time but after just a bit of experience, it rocks.  So does FAB:B.  

Great game with several real innovations.  The ability to manage losses by breaking off an unsuccessful attack and allowing the defender to bug out or fight a pitched defense is superb and replicates the on-site commander's ability to manage his battlefield situation.

Superb game with lots of new approaches.  Imagine being able to allocate support units without the micromanagement of moving engineers and artillery.  It reduces the detail work that a corps or army commander wouldn't do in the first place.

It's a neat game.  It represents the decisions of the Combat Commander at a meaningful level, allowing you to choose which assets to gamble, and which to sacrifice.  It is an excellent representation of the battle at this level, with traffic congestion, fuel problems, and intra-corps rivalry modeled in an easy to operate system.  However, do NOT BE FOOLED by the "3" complexity; it is AT LEAST a "5" (Combat Commander, in contrast, is rated a "5" but should be a "4", and Twilight Struggle is rated a "4" and ought to be a "3").  This complexity comes from the multiple choices available in asset use.  Many assets have uses in multiple phases, and until the game is learned well, both players will have to play with reference cards in hand.  That being said, these decisions are the meat of the game (Should I burn my command staff asset to reinforce the 1st Division, or do send them down St Vith to rally the disorganized troops before the Germans hit again?)  This sense of having a lot of things to do and only being able to accomplish about 30% of them on any given turn makes for a very tense game.  It captures what player liked about EE in a format that doesn't require a two day time commitment.

FAB: The Bulge offers an interesting take on the bulge and wargames in general.  It says its low complexity, and to a certain extent that is true, but it is certainly fiddly even with the low counter density.  The "block" game aspect creates a rather lame attempt at fog of war (low counter density + good memory = I know that block in Bastogne is an elite armor), but also enables the sleek "step-loss" system for degrading units.   The blocks are fantastic in layout.  Providing easy access to the troop quality, size and type.  The chit draw system for assets and events feels a little wonky, and can be gamey since used assets go back into the draw bag, creating situations where if you use a lot of engineers, then you end up drawing even more engineers (as an example).  This is compounded by the fact that the number of chits in the draw bag is low, so you really do impact the chit mixture when using assets.  

As a game, I was surprised at how quickly it played and how easy it was to see the trouble spots on the board.  the low counter density and the at-a-glance ease of reading the blocks reduced downtime by having all of the applicable info easy to digest.  I think this is where the "Fast Action Battle" name is deserved.  Where the name is not deserved, is set-up time and rules complexity.  My opponent,  was gracious enough to have this set-up and ready to play when I got there, but it looks like hell not just  to organize all of the block on the map, but more so in setting up each turns reinforcements.  The ruleset is dense.  I told my opponent I would read the downloadable rules, and I did, but I did so in a car with my wife drivign and I was finding the reading to be slow and I only comprehend the bare essentials of the system and was barely able to flounder through the games first few turns before I grasped the nuances.  

All-in-all, an enjoyable Bulge game, and a system that I am glad GMT is  supporting with new titles.

A very unique aproach to the BotB. Fun rating. I'm sure rating will go up after more play than the introductiory set up. I would advise spraying the counters. I have been spraying counters for years. It not only looks good but protects them as well, Just like GMT suggest you do.

 My Caesar at Alesia 1976 AH looks like new. becasue it's been sparyed back in the day. My Dad's advise. I may even spay the blocks. I have an East Front first edition where the red blocks look redish grey, ( the grime) how discusting is that! They were not sprayed, picked it up in trade. Of course the guy I got it from uses the blocks for fidget stones. Does any one know how to clean the blocks without removing the stickers, or the color?

 Just remember to spray light even coats. It's so easy to be tempted to spay just one more up & down, left & right...DON'T DO IT! Proper way: One time left to right or visa versa, Then ONE time up and down or visa vers, Let stand for at least 20 minutes then repeat. I do this 4 to 6 times. I build a lot of DTP games and that's the best way. believe me, I have ruined many a set of counter trying to hurry.

Plays fast once the rules are fully embeded. But learning the rules is fairly hard work. This isn't helped by the fact that the rules are split into two booklets, one for exclusive and one for series rules and there are many exceptions to several rules. I've found that it was all too easy to overlook rules in this game.

As I said early once the rules are fully understood it's not a bad game, although the army bounderies really channel the German efforts and restrict choices

With that said, the system is clean, the battle is well-implemented, and the assets, events, and special actions are a great way to keep the chrome without overwhelming gamers with hard-to-remember rules exceptions.  There's a lot of great positional thinking, and the battle is modeled well, with the Germans trying to achieve a breakout while the allies desperately try to maintain a cohesive line.  A worthy followup to [gameid=6205] and [gameid=20609] by designer Rick Young.

Yes, a very good system but still a bit more complex than needed (in terms of the rules).  The orientation game is a nice intro.  It will probably get easier after more plays.  I like the asset allocation system.

Only played the intro scenario thus far; I like what I see!

The rules are simple and effective, and combat is procedural enough that you get all the modifiers down pretty quickly. I like the low density of the units, and the way the game captures the decisions and tension of the campaign.  As far as how fast it is, myself and another newbie played through a 7 turn game in about four hours.  Not fast for a Euro, maybe, but not bad for a serious wargame.

An albatross around my neck that weakens my heart and shortens my lifespan.

A bad investment with no return.

A blackbird cawing and scratching outside my window, mocking my every breath.

(OK, let's trade this puppy already. What a bad idea this turned out to be.)

Excellent player aids.  One play of Nuts! scenario with my 7-year-old.  His Americans beat my Germans handily.  Eager to play again.  Preliminary rating 7.

Second play was the tournament scenario (with a grown-up).  The game flows very smoothly.  The combat procedure becomes second nature quite quickly.  Only had to briefly consult the rules a couple of times.  A nice bulge formed.  Bumped my rating up to 8 with more potential upside.

10/29/10:  Too hard to keep the rules in my head.  Bumped back down to 7.

Somewhat more complex and fiddly than other block games thanks to all the counters in use! Relatively easy rules, but with a lot of 'chrome' to learn.

Different rules than I first expected. It took some time to put them in perspective. I like the system although it is not exactly fast and can bit a bit fiddly. I am looking forward to more titles in this series.

Fantastic game that delivers a huge scope in a compact and easy to manage design.  You get the sense you are playing a really big game, however it plays very fast and smoothly.  Tense, lots of interactions and tough decisions along the way.  Really a very satisfying experience.

This is the first "block wargame" that I bought, when it said FAST action, I was expecting a 2-3 hour game, not so. I think it took us the best part of 7 hours to play through.

The game isn't too complicated and we enjoyed playing, and a typical game now takes somewhere in the region of 4 hours to complete, which is OK.  The game plays really well.

The game models asset allocation well, and you have to make some tough choices, who gets artillery support, etc, nice components too.

Grandísimo juego y con perspectivas de mucha rejugabilidad. Original, rápido, tenso. Todo lo que se le puede pedir a un juego.

Tentative rating based on playing the ho-hum Nuts scenario.  Considering that I enjoyed FAB Sicily, I need to go back and give this game another shot.

When I was a youngster and worked for an Allied Van Lines agent, we had this picture on the wall of a bunch of men in fluorescent speedos.  Beneath them, it said "Battle of the Bulge".  I hope this game can hold a candle to that picture.  Judging from all the buzz, it looks like there is a pretty good chance.

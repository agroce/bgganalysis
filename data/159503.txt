RATING: N/A
I've played this game twice, and it was a blast. It's a better, harder, Pandemic. With that said, I haven't played my own copy yet - and am not sure if I need to own this - since I have Pandemic, and don't plan on getting rid of it. Decisions decisions...

Pros:
Great graphic design. Fantastic sci-fi Star Trek/FTL theme. Fairly simple rules. Loads of different roles to play. Fun!

Cons: 
Difficult to win! The player roles can determine what you end up doing for most of the game if you want to play efficiently. Could get repetitive.

RATING: 6
The art needs work. The game is hard for a co-op, but I enjoyed the theme.

RATING: 8.5
Best "Star Trek" coop game which comes in a small box! The gameplay feels somehow similar to Pandemic. The theme and the alerts add a lot of "safe the ship" tension. 
There are a lot of fun characters that play quite differently. It scales really well with all possible player counts. The game may suffer from alpha-leaders.

First ever kickstarter. It was hyped up as a Pandemic killer and sadly didn't live up. It's ok, but doesn't seem to have the tightness of similar co-ops. Also it's incredibly brutal. The sense of impending doom begins before the first turn as half your ship blows apart during set up, and it's pretty much flying by the seat of your pants from there on!

A great tower defense game.  Very tough.  A multitude of figures allows for a lot of replay-ability.  Intense play.  If you like Star Trek, then this is definitely a game for you.  

Also Episode 2 (Adrift 2015) and Episode 3 (Lockdown 2017)

RATING: 8
Imagine that you are one of the crew in your favorite science fiction TV show. Now imagine that in the last 10 minutes of the show things have gone so badly that the captain is dead and you and the surviving members of your crew have to pull together and save the day yourselves!

The Captain Is Dead is a co-op game for 2 to 7 players. All you have to do is get the ship's engines (aka "Jump Core") back online and you win, but because there is a hostile alien ship trying to destroy you, that is easier said than done.

Fantastic game that ticks every box in my book - co-op, thematic, tension, decisions, laughs and sound effects (you have to provide these).  

The theme is perfectly realised as you and your fellow crew members must work together, battling to hold your starship together against a series of overwhelming faults, system crashes, attacking vessels and invading aliens.  Multiple competing options, sharing information, dealing with crises - this game has it all.  The artwork is super cool, a well designed board with perfectly allocated spaces for all the cards and components, a great variety and mix of characters and events that really support replayability, multiple levels of difficulty, easy to learn, and all done in around 60-90 minutes.

Ample opportunities to really 'ham it up' and in increase the fun by really playing to your the character's role, making announcements, calling alerts and making various sound effects.

If you're a fan of co-ops - The Captain is Dead really should be on your table.

This is a good coop game.   Lots of diversity.  However know that difficulty is more than just what you set the board to at the beginning.  Depending on the characters selected and the number of players hard games can be easy and easy games hard.   The game itself is very fun and the theme is well done.

this is a fun little game. its great because it can accomodate a bunch of people. will says it's like FTL the board game. I disagree since i played FTL for an hour before rage-quitting and throwing my monitor out the window. I did not do the same to this board. 
you play as the starship enterprise's crew basically and put out fires on the ship. it's tense and the art style is nice. small children will find the mechanics easy to grasp and the bright colors appealing. 
I would rather play settlers of catan, but only if you paid me 10,000 dollars also.

Demo at Essen 2017. If you like coops you will like this one. I'm not a big fun of them but I liked it better than other. It's intense, everything is breaking and it only gets worse.

The good news - this is a co-op that is pretty damn challenging. 

The bad news - it's just not that much fun. Like many co-ops it can suffer from the alpha player just dominating the game. If the cards come out in the wrong order (especially the anomalies) you're in trouble. The fact you play through all the yellow alert cards every game means you'll learn what they do and the variety is just the order they appear.

Game itself is very much a small production - which has it's charm, but could have done with a bit of development. You don't need a pawn for every character for example

Overall, I played it, it was ok ... but no desire to own it or play it again over the many other co-ops out there.

RATING: 9
Brilliant game that's not too complex.  It has a similar co-operative feel to pandemic, where every turn you deal with a threats and work as a team to resolve them while working toward an overall goal.  Each person has a unique identity too, which gives them special abilities to help.  

Every time I've brought this out, the people playing it inevitably lose the first game, then want to play it again!  

It's actually quite difficult, but in a good way.  You're rarely in a position where you're convinced you've already lost and you're required to keep playing.  While defeat can come in a variety of ways, there is always hope, and the increasing sense of tension that you're getting closer to victory or death.  

The game has a lot of moving parts, but not a lot of distinct pieces, which greatly reduces complexity.  You basically have your pawn moving around a ship, skill cards in hand, ship systems to be aware of, and alerts to deal with.   

Also a huge plus is the game accommodates a variety of players, it's rare to have a 1-7 that actually works!  

My only recommendation would be that if you have 1-3 players, you may want to consider having multiple roles per person.

I'm not the biggest on co-op adventure games, because most lend themselves to limited play-throughs as they're scenario based.  This one has random events (and quite a few of them!) along with varying difficulty levels to achieve, which seems to keep it fresh, although the engineer seems a bit OP.. If you don't stay on top of your disasters, the wheels can come off pretty quickly which adds a nice layer of urgency to the whole affair.  All in all, an enjoyable co-op game that doesn't require ornate specific scenario setups that you can hop into to break up competitive game sessions.

I really enjoy this game.  The theme comes through very strongly and, although it's not an official 'Star Trek' game, it does have a very Star Trek feel.  For me it felt very much like a TNG crew versus the Borg.  

Plus points for me:

- a large variety of roles with specific abilities, which increases replayability, keeps it fresh and offers new challenges (some roles are easier than others!)

- Solid mechanics, all of which make sense and are in keeping with the theme

- A sense of urgency.  The game keeps you on your toes.  It's not an easy win, and it can come right down to the last turn!

-   A sense of control.  You are not just reacting to what is happening on the board.  You are proactively planning and choosing what you want to happen.

Cons for me:

- The 'alert deck' is always the same set of cards.  They come up in a different order but you know what is in there after a few games.  I don't have the expansion(s) yet but I WILL be getting them and I think that will help.

- I think it would be a lot nicer with actual minis.  It can be tricky to see which character is which as the background to ALL the stickers (aliens and crew) is black.  Alternatively, they could have made the crew background white and keep the aliens background black, to help to distinguish them.  I think they are fixing this in future editions.

Overall opinion:  If you like co-ops, then get this game.  It is fun, it is thematic, it is tight.  My whole group loved it!

A thematic co-op that puts you in the position of trying to fix your ship while alien forces keep tearing it apart.  It's hard to find time to devote to fixing that warp drive when your shields and computer and missile system and other stuff keep breaking...all while being boarded by aliens!   Good stuff.  I put it up their with Alien Encounters..legacy.  Might even beat it by a point.

RATING: 7.5
Rules Note (from the designer/forums): Powers that affect 'any player in the room'  also work on the player themselves - and when they're alone (so the Medical Officer can heal themself, and the Crewman always dies when he takes an injury). 

Great theme, great implementation. Better than Flash Point, because of theme, and without the constant between-turn dice-rolling to establish threats. My usual group doesn't enjoy co-ops, but we've played this one 10 games in a row.

Use random characters - too easy otherwise (on 'normal').

This is a heavily thematic cooperative quasi-role playing game.   Basically its Star Trek the co-op game and if you love Star Trek and want to pretend to be a character in that show, maybe this is for you.  But then, that’s what makes this game straddle the line between being a “game” and being an “activity.”  As someone who isn’t much of a fan of Star Trek and could not really get into the theme I had to try to get my fun only from the game play; and from a gaming aspect, it felt like… turn over a card… get a problem/dilemma… send your little character over somewhere on the board to fix it… turn over a new card… more bad things happen… send your little character over somewhere to fix it… repeat…. things get worse and worse…

As a cooperation game goes I enjoyed the discussion and rapport between players as we discussed what needed to be done and what we could do for each other more than usual. Maybe because there were so many "alerts" and pretty horrendous things going on it made a difference on every play. This made the game even more engaging with little down time. This is pretty intense as co-ops go.

Cooperative : 2014 : The Captain is Dead is a co-op game for 2 to 7 players. All you have to do is get the ship's engines (aka "Jump Core") back online and you win; but because there is a hostile alien ship trying to destroy you, that is easier said than done.

A better co-op than Red November, and much more enjoyable than Flashpoint: Fire Rescue. I don't really go for sci-fi games, but I can tolerate this one.

Loved my first play of this game- deceptively tough, but fair, this is a great cooperative game with lots of replayability.  In our game play we barely got through the yellow alerts and could see the escalating dangers to our crew overwhelming us and forcing us to make more and more desperate attempts to save our ships.  :)  The game is easy to learn and the narrative really shines through.  Recommended!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
It's a decent game and nicely thematic, and my group definitely likes it quite a bit; I'm probably the least interested of the bunch. Some reasons why:

I was really looking for more agonizing player choices, but the best alternative to choose is usually pretty clear due to available skill cards and discounts, system states, etc. Perhaps some of the most interesting choices I made were when playing the Admiral and having to choose between two quite useful Battle Plans.

It's disappointing that the full alert deck is used for every game. After repeated plays, players know what's coming. For example, players know the anomalies that will appear in every game. IMHO it would be better to randomly remove some cards from the deck to change it up each play, but doing this with the current setup would just make the deck faster and thus significantly harder. Some blank cards with the appropriate backs would do the trick.

The game is much easier with more players; it is very hard with 3. Some characters are strictly better than others, so many of the characters won't see much play unless you choose them randomly or elect to use them just for yuks. This part of the design seems to be in need of more balancing.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 9.3
Fun and really encourages cooperative play. I feel it's extremely difficult to win with 2-players. I think it plays better at 3 or more players. Great game, but I like Pandemic with two players much better.

RATING: 9
Frantic fun (as long as you are prepared to lose often). This has quickly become a firm favourite. Almost impossible to win at 2P without a Chief Engineer, but we put surviving to the bottom of the alert deck down as a goal without her. Now played as 5P and it just gets better! Some horrific defeats and some glorious wins (we can't decide which we enjoyed the most though!).

RATING: 8
This game is probably the one I was most excited about in 2014. It packs quite a bit of mechanics in without making it feel clunky and overwhelming, and it actually plays really well with just two players - something a lot of games claim to do but never quite manage to pull off.

I have played similar games, but this one is my favourite.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 8.5
Easily my best KS pickup, and I've made a few.  It's a solid atmospheric co-op that's lightweight enough to pickup and play, but challenging enough to withstand a few playthroughs.  Comes with a huge number of different roles that create diverse tactical combinations.  My only wish is that it came with more variety in the alerts... What's that?  There's a stack of add-in advanced alerts?  Well then.

This game is better than Pandemic, in my opinion. It plays very similarly, so Pandemic players won't have much of a learning curve and you feel the impact of your actions more directly than in Pandemic. The only downside is that the components aren't quite as good.

Great co-op game. Nice combination of action and hand management. Rules are easy. The game flows fairly good despite that there are a lot of things to keep track of on the board.
Lots of discussion and co-operation. What do you prioritize, long term vs short term problems? Which character goes where? etc.
Game difficulty is easy to change. Lots of different characters to play that feels different. 

The game doesn't do anything that hasn't already been done, but still feels interesting. 
A bit worried about the replayability though. It mostly comes from playing different roles and the order in which the "crisis" cards are revealed. More scenarios or something that changes the way you approach the problems would be nice.

And… that is how a typical game of The Captain is Dead (TCID) starts.

In short: this is a GREAT coop that is easily overlooked due to limited marketing by Game Crafter. Much better than Pandemic in my book. It's a solid "8".

The Captain, still itchy from a recent bout with a disease of Venus, was manspreading on his command couch.  He shifted uncomfortably, activated internal coms and addressed the crew.  "Let's take this bad boy out of jump and get this milk run over with," he said in his tinfoil-panty-removing basso profundo, resting his cleft chin on an alien-slugging fist, "delivering..." he looked at his Medical Officer.

"Vaccines," said Doc.

The Captain rolled his eyes.  "Vaccines.  To..."

"Paradise Four."

"Of course it is.  What the hell—make it so!"

[i]Thirty-seven seconds later:[/i]

Slapped back to consciousness with a memory of lung-squeezing concussion.  Fountains of sparks.  The smell of burning meat and metal.  Alarms barking a madman's litany of systems offline.  During the first—or was it the second?—volley a hull armor girder had tobogganed through the bridge, wiping out most of the command crew.   

The Janitor wound up and slapped the Medical Officer again, putting blood in his mouth.  "The Captain!" screamed the Janitor.  "The Captain!"

Doc looked at the Captain, in two large pieces, and the wet drip of the rest of him on the ceiling.  "The Captain," he paused, pulling from a long, storied, galaxy-hopping career and deep medical knowledge rife with concrete examples of the specific requirements for normal function, "is—"

"Yes?" said the Janitor.

"Is—"

"Say it," breathed the Janitor.

"Good God, man, use your own eyes!" Doc raged.

The third volley lanced through the ship, knocking the deck out from under their feet, and the race for survival was on.

[b]After 2 plays:[/b]  A less-fussy [gameid=38453], distilled down to the core experience—a [-][i]Star Trek[/i][/-] "sci-fi TV show" crew desperately struggling to keep their ship in one piece long enough to go to warp.  The promise of deep variability and replay value, as well as gorgeous art, make it attractive...  But I worry that like a beautiful human it may be empty inside.  We shall see.

Great co-op. Played it on TS, then bought the real thing because I enjoyed it so much. My favorite co-op: thematic, engaging, and in my experience, without some of the AP I see in co-op games.

RATING: 7
Enjoyable game so far, but seems very difficult without having a couple of key characters in play (Engineer/Teleporter Chief in particular; Admiral is also almost a must-play in our house).  Will try out other combinations in future plays, but not sure if we have the patience to fail a bunch of times figuring out the best way to play some of the more obscure characters.

Very enjoyable co-op game. I really enjoy it with more players, you get fewer turns and the downtime is more, but depending on who you are playing with the conversations about what to do get really good.

I have played the game several times now.  All games were with 3 players, and have come to realize it is very hard to win if you pick the hologram in a 3 person game.  If the CPU cor or teleporter goes off line, that person can't move...and if the other two are fighting aliens and fixing other systems, while grabbing skills to bring the jump drive on line, this person is useless.  We have removed the white players when playing 3 player games and have won 50% of the time...still a very challenging game to play but lots of fun.

* Kickstarted! *

Cooperative game in which you need to use your actions and abilities to keep the ship running long enough for engineering to get it out of there. There are nice bits of humour in the manual, the art is clear, the potential for variation solid and the theme oozes out of every component. But this game definitely requires a larger crew to function properly -- at 2 or 3, there is too much to do and too little staff to handle it.

PLUS: theme, ease to learn, variation
MINUS: less players increases the difficulty significantly

RATING: 5
I'm not sure this one brings much, if anything, new to the table, but if you like the theme and you like co-ops, you might like this. However...

The production on this is pretty low quality, which is normally not an issue for me but this one purports to be a "thematic" co-op. Almost feels like a good prototype more than a finished product. Very generic artwork and feel to the components. And...

...some aspects of the game feel more mechanical than thematic. Aliens board your ship!! Then they hang out in one room and just stand around in front of the machines like some irritating punks. They are there simply to bleed your actions in having to get rid of them. Yes, makes mechanical sense, but not logical or thematic sense. But I think the biggest issue...

...is that as systems break down and prevent you from doing things, the game also gets less fun because you have less options. I prefer co-ops where the outside pressure continues to grow and you need to do more and more with what little you've got. In this one, the main pressure comes from the fact that you are able to do less and less. For me, being able to do less and less is also less interesting.

RATING: N/A

I really hope this game is re-issued with better components, because it's one of the funner co-op games out there. You can adjust the difficulty level, and one really gets the sense that you're in a crew under siege, with everybody having something valuable to add. There is also very little downtime between turns making it good for the easily bored.

 I'd buy it if the price was lower; I only own the digital version. They should really kickstart it with more solid components.

First off, the good news about this game: The illustrations and graphic design choices for this game are top notch. Now the bad news. The game is rather pedestrian overall. The package is nice and doesn't seem to have any problems with gameplay, but what is there is done much better in other games. It's as if the designer had played [gameid=37111] and decided instead of a hidden traitor game they wanted to make a co-op game. The component quality is also not very good, but probably better than what the average Game Crafter game looks like. The game definitely could have used a producer to look over and make the design leaner and meaner. I am really glad I played this game, but overall if I never played it again I don't feel like I would be missing anything.

I bought this game as an interesting-looking cooperative game that I thought would be fun for a variety of people in part because of it being cooperative rather than competitive.  However, I have found this game is too complex for most of the people in my regular gaming group.  Heck, it's almost too complex for me given each time I've played there's been some significant rules error although I think I've ironed out the kinks at this point.  In any case, for more hardcore gamers and perhaps also/especially big fans of Star-Trek-like genres this game seems pretty sweet.  It also seems to hold a lot of promise for solo play, although I haven't tried that out yet.

This is a favorite of mine, i prefer co op board games and this is the cream of the crop. every one has their own piece to the puzzle and it highly encourages table talk keeping all players engaged. because so much is going on at once it helps prevent having one player make all the decisions of the game (which commonly happens with my group when playing pandemic or similar games)  the captain is dead is a fun game of playing catch up as the cards dish out bad luck on the crew and you scramble for survival. i highly suggest purchasing this game and after a few play through on normal i challenge you to take on the "insane" difficulty level.

This is the kind of game I like. It's really challenging without being unfair about it, and cooperation between players is essential. It's a completely shameless Star Trek knockoff in a way that's similar to "Redshirts," but it's not quite so tongue-in-cheek/goofy about it, which I appreciated. If difficult cooperative games like Pandemic or Flashpoint are your jam like they are mine, this one is worth checking out.

FTL meets Star Trek, with some Pandemic, Space Alert, and Flash Point in the mix as well -- but also its own thing. By the end of my first game, we realized we'd actually lost about 45 minutes earlier (missed a rule), and holy crap was there a lot going on with the board. But for all that, it's not a complex game; busy, but not complex.

First game felt like a learning game for me. By the end, we were ticking along pretty effectively, and I could see the "Pandemic arc" of homing in on what to prioritize across the next few games. I'd happily play this again.

I enjoy this game quite a bit. It certainly feels like playing an episode of Star Trek gone wrong. I only don't rate it higher because I personally feel like it probably doesn't have a very high replay value. You'll get the same alerts every game, just in different orders. Once you know the battle plans and items you know exactly what you need for a specific situation. But I think this game is challenging enough to provide your group with different strategies for at least a few good plays. It's certainly worth it, I just don't think it's as timeless as something like Yinsh.

7 -- > 6 : Nothing changed. I just still feel like the lack of replayability kills this game a bit. That, and I'm not a huge fan of co-ops.

A solid 1-7 player cooperative game about running around a starship and trying desperately to fix problems before the ship blows up!

There is enough variety in the various crew members you can play (18, spread across 7 categories) and their abilities, plus the various challenges you face, that the game won't get stale for quite a while!

The only real downsides are several errors in the cards and numerous errors/problems with the rulebook, plus some crew members are clearly more useful than others. Finally, there can be specific sequences of problems that can occur which will end the game before the players have much of a chance to react, which can feel rather unfair when it happens.

The game kicks off on the right foot with an evocative title and theme that allows you to ham it up right from the start. I thoroughly enjoyed my first play, but I suspect that future games will show that to do well you just stick at your job (the things your character power allows you to do more efficiently than the other characters) and continue it repetitively through the game, minimising moves as much as possible. Which probably results in making your experience within a game somewhat one-dimensional. I suspect that success at harder levels is dependent on picking the a-team crew and getting lucky with the order of the end of turn events. Still, the events make it impossible to plan perfectly so there's always disaster recovery options to consider each turn as a team, and there's lot of options to consider, with no perfect bandleader solution - just risk vs effort vs reward payoffs - which is always great in a co-op. It resulted in much chatter and a positive social experience that I'd happily request again.

Shiny! THIS GAME ROCKS! A very difficult co-op that FEELS like you're living out Galaxy Quest. So charge up your weapons, get ready for teleportation, and put on your ship's uniform including a 2nd underpants because you're going to get your butt kicked! It feels like a good cross of Star Trek and Red November. Much replayability. 

Very good production. I like the art choices. Some minor rules holes that require FAQ.

The Captain is Dead is a fairly formulaic cooperative game--players are assigned roles that make them good at specific things, a negative event happens every turn, and the players have to move their pawn around the board to try to fix all the bad stuff that's happening.  Here, there's an overall goal (fixing the warp core) that lets you win the game, so you have to try to make time for that while not getting the ship destroyed because of all the other stuff.  While the mechanics were fairly ho-hum, I felt that the theme really stood out in the game--it really did feel like a SciFi TV show.

This remains my favourite wholly cooperative game. The theme comes through strongly and the game is tense because it is well-balanced and very often a close call for survival. Within each role type there appears to be one role that seems the 'better' choice, but that isn't necessarily a flaw - it can offer greater challenge to face danger with a less obviously skilled crew.

My favorite of the co-op genre (outside of Space Alert, which is really its own beast).  So many co-ops exist whose sole virtue is that they are co-ops, but lack interesting mechanics outside of that.  In this one, each area of the ship has different actions you can take in it, giving meaning to darting from place to place.  Also, the fact that these areas of the ship can take damage and therefore you can't take that action until it is repaired is a spectacular mechanic.

Beyond that, the whole game just feels like you are a crew panicking in space while under attack trying to repair the jump drive.  The geometrical space art and quirky character powers just brings it over the top.  Always a blast.  Play it with people who are fun.

Awesome game. We played with a Game Crafter set that was different than the Kickstarter or the upcoming retail versions, based on pictures of the latter I think it looked better.

This is the best co-op game I have played.

Good fun co-op which, if played optimally, should be fairly simple, although the initial events can really hammer you. Optimal play should see a victory, but hard to be optimal when you're face down in the Cargo Bay. Again!

I am really impressed by this little gem.
The game is tense and difficult, with real cooperation needed to overcome every single turn. I expect the large number of possible roles and their wide range of skills make for a great replay factor.
Of course I would prefer better components and a larger map, but in every case The Captain is Dead is the best cooperative game I played till now.

This is a Pandemic-killer, for me. Much more difficult to "solve" the winning strategy. Every part of the ship has an important and useful function, and they will constantly be shutting down, so tension is always high. I love the sci-fi theme and the cubism retro style art. Easily supports a high player count.
Unfortunately, being a Game Crafter game, the components just don't feel as polished as a professionally produced game. I worry about carrying the flimsy box to game nights.
Also, this came around in a time where I'm just not as in to cooperative games as I used to be. Oh well. Still a very enjoyable experience!

Really wanted to like this game, and would consider playing again with more people (played with only 2), however:

-Rules/rulebook are terribly organized, often unclear, unpolished (not sure which order to read the paragraphs sometimes and there were still typos after 6 errata updates), and lack key clarifications

-Cards can be awfully swingy for smaller numbers of players. Many of the Captain's Log cards are mostly useless for two players. Also, many of the key mechanics (e.g. Comms) aren't that useful if one of you has to run around all the time anyway and you don't have a specific character trait (neither of us had a Engineering bonus, so it didn't matter who had the engineering cards).

-Although the injury mechanic was fine, too many situations arose where a player's turn was effectively skipped or otherwise boring. 4 aliens in my room? Great. Oh I need to not go anywhere and do the same damn action yet again because that's my specialty? Super fun.

Frantic coop, where shit constantly hits the fan. 
 
You are part of the crew of this faster than light space ship of the future... but the aliens you've met didn't like you that much and decided to shoot your captain and pummel your ship into oblivion. Can you fix the warp core before your ship is destroyed? 

With systems failing all around you and boarding teams of aliens entering your ship, this job isn't as easy as it sounds. Make the most out of your crew, and use each of them to their powers. Work together and don't try to be a hero. You will lose.

Finally got to play this at game night. Was fun, though we're definitely playing on a higher difficulty the next time. We started on novice because we've had devastating losses in other coop games, but won just as the orange alerts were getting started and never really felt seriously threatened with 7 players. everyone just funneled engineering skills to me (the chief engineer) and went around killing aliens while I sat in engineering fixing the jump drive. 

I got the AEG edition, which is quite pretty and has nice components, aside from one misprinted card. The clear standee-style pawns are especially lovely. The rulebook could use a little more clarification; we had a few questions during play that seemed pretty standard but weren't addressed anywhere in the rulebook that I could see, like "what happens if you get injured when you're already injured?" (The rulebook doesn't say to do anything, so in that case we decided it didn't do anything in particular, and injuries don't "stack" meaningfully.)

Final verdict: possibly my new favorite co-op game. Even though or game was uneventful, as soon as it ended several people all said, "definitely gonna have to play that one again."

Here's hoping the AEG version gets the expansions.

Despite having a very similar theme, this does not play like Space Alert at all. 
It's resource optimization against rising threats, but with charming presentation (unless you despise the design style) and enough variability (coming through the special abilities of the 18 characters to choose from) to keep you busy quite a long time.

Enjoyable Co op where all the roles feel useful. Rewards skilled play and good meneuvering, but it is pretty random for most of the first half of the game. Nice difficulty with good options to make it harder or easier, and great range at 2-7 players. It gets easier the more people there are, and after about 30 plays I think 3-4 is the sweet spot.

Nice Co-op only 'BattleStar Galactica lite' that's a fun, somewhat quick strategic game that inspires alot of tabletalk and figuring out what to do with the limited actions/equipment to achieve victory while at the same time making concessions on what to repair/leave offline as you deal with other threats like the aliens onboard or the ship itself being attacked. 

With the character roles having a plethora of unique abilities and skill discounts it nicely changes the gameplay on multiple plays just based on some of these character choices alone and keeps things fresh.(That quirky Hologram guy for example is interesting and borderline overpowered up until he is rendered immobile quite easily)
Good stuff, Good Kickstarter title here.

Played with seven people. Lots of dead time between turns, lots of turns spent mitigating player-disabling random events. I expect modern board games to have thoroughly learned the lesson that losing a turn to RNG is to be avoided in design. Technically another player can use their turn to bring you back up, but then [i]that[/i] player's lost a turn to RNG [i]and[/i] social obligation. Hooray~~~~~~

We removed the orange cards to speed things up, but won before it would have mattered. Winning felt like it was basically out of convenience and wasn't very exciting or tense for me.

The Captain Is Dead needs to successfully distract you with its flavor, or it just falls flat.

The designers were obviously fans of Space Alert, but unfortunately their iteration removed the most fun elements of that game: the real-time pressure of working against a clock, the need to communicate with your teammates to ensure success and plan together, and the fun of finding out that your best laid plans weren't as well laid as you hoped.  Both games are whack-a-mole, but this one feels static and the players feel removed in comparison.

I do like the many options for player roles.  That's probably the game's strongest aspect.

This games is a ton of fun and it really encourages cooperative play. More fun with the more people you can get together, a 7 player game can take a while, but it can turn into a fun strategy session with the right players.  Certainly playable with only 2 or 3 people, but the game gets much harder with smaller numbers of people.  Overall, I and my friends haven't had a bad gaming session yet with this game and would highly recommend to others.

Current rating is 8, but may increase with further plays. This is an excellent thematic cooperative game, which is unlike any other coop I've played. It replicates the chaos and impending doom of every Star Trek 'ship in crisis' episode you've ever watched, including the invasion of hostile aliens and the systems going offline. 

The art style is idiosyncratic, but excellent. My husband describes it as 'Red November if it didn't suck', but I think it combines shades of Battlestar Galactica and Pandemic too.

Definitely worth getting hold of a copy, if you can find one.

Can be brutally hard or very easy. It's fairly heavily luck driven because if the first 5 attacks before the game start aren't that bad, then you can do OK. But if the first 5 injure nearly everyone, damage the teleporter, and disable the communications (trading cards) it makes it REALLY hard to recover and you die quickly. 

Assuming you don't get screwed by the first attack wave, the game is really fun. Good collaboration and utilizing each class type's abilities plus multiple options to increase replay value. I can't see how anybody could ever beat it on the hardest difficulty, seems impossible to me haha.

If you're planning on saving a sinking ship with help from friends then I'd heartily recommend this. The concisely illustrated board lends to the feeling of moving around a space vessel, unlike Battlestar Galactica which by comparison is two hours down the drain. The Captain is infact already dead and there is no traitor mechanic, although the task at hand is brutally challenging enough that players have their hands full. Saving your crewmates can be played at various difficulty levels meaning the adventure can be enjoyed by groups at any level of experience.

Space ship coop action point tower defense.

I have to say, I am impressed.  This game is really fun, and tough.  I bring out the best in cooperative environments, and truly represents its theme, as the various characters argue with one another on the best course of action, after their captain has died.  The rules are simple, and not too problem-laden.  The graphics are nice and crisp.  The board could have been a bit bigger, so allow for space for those things now put outside the board.   Fun game.

Another cooperative that barely deserves the name game. I love the theme but a role that amounts to draw cards and hand them off to other players isn't fun.

Buyed in 2014 second hand.

Played Tannenberg and Marne. Lots of fun and tension but .... I feel that the combat system made the units to fragile (brittle). I would have prefered a classic CRT.

Playing time for each scenario: 2-4 hours

Jugado el escenario de Tanneberg. interesante el sistema de combate, aunque puede dar situaciones sorprendentes hasta el punto de que no queden piezas sobre el tablero. Aún así es ágil y divertido. Vale la pena no atacar demasiado y esperar al momento oportuno de jugártela.

RATING: 8
I think the Clash of Giants system is an excellent example of how to create the feel for a period of warfare and a campaign with a minimum of rules.  Tannenburg is worth the price of admission alone.  While the Russians have the advantage of numbers, their two armies are far apart and move slowly.  Their Second Army is also hamstrung by supply. The more mobile Germans have an advantage in quality and the central position. On early acquaintance it seems a really finely balanced scenario, full of tough decisions for both sides.  The Marne feels altogether more straightforward, but still it's a decent representation of that campaign.  

The maps are clear and quite nicely done. The rules are an easy enough read, but needed two pages of errata to plug some significant gaps and correct errors.  Shame on you, GMT.

RATING: 7
Nice clean system, I particularly like the tactical efficiency rating concept. Interesting scenarios with lots of manouver.

Low counter density both benefits and hurts the game. While it makes the game quick and clean, it also allows for huge gaps between units which in turn leads to gamey strategies of running individual units deep behind enemy lines.
Also, the Marne scenario feels a bit too tightly controlled/scripted with the allied player being forced to retreat all the way to the far side of the map (or else units can't leave the zone of their parent formation) which is typical of many Raicer games.

RATING: 7
Almost gave it light to medium because it is spread over two rule books but this is really a light game with just enough chrome to make it interesting.  I have only played Tannenberg so far but it was enjoyable.  For some reason this reminds me of a game I played 20 years ago called Onslaught which is a D-day game.  I think it is just the overall feel.  A solid game like most of Mr. Racier's designs.  Ted Racier is becoming a favorite designer.

Games has two battles: Tannenberg and The Marne.  Tannenberg seems more balanced of the two.  Some unique inputs including variable movement and a CRT which stresses tactical efficency.  This introduces enough variables to give it a higher replay value.  
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
A nice idea for Ted to milk another round of games out of his WWI knowledge, but to me, this "simple WWI game" scheme is too simple for its own good in several places.  

And yet for a generally simple game, it suffers from the flaw of the ill-chosen decision to go with split rules/battle books.  Due to the resultant unavoidable parsing of general rules and battle-specific custom rules, I found myself flipping back and forth in and between both books annoyingly frequently.  Although this is an admin facet, this one publishing decision has proven to be a steady irritant each time I play the game (6 Tannenbergs, 2 Marnes).

Tannenberg -- I second other reviewers' comments; Tannenberg is more fun, more open, and also way more prone to Russian wins.  This can be attributed to the march tables.  A few Russian dr6s, or a small streak of 4-6s, can launch the Russ 2nd army unstoppably into the Ger west/rear areas, and there's little the Ger can do about it unless the Russ has been completely incompetent with the Russ 1st army.  In this game, a few bad Ger march rolls, coupled with average Russ rolls, or a few hot ones, has led to solid to steamroller Russ wins 5 games of 6 for me.  To a lesser degree, the combat system is also more of a luckfest than a typical wargame; the Germans, so thin on the ground, are very vulnerable to poor dice; a few extra 5s or 6s can decimate an entire operational group.

Both these weaknesses could have been fixed -- with a little more work, a few more rules, or some table tweaks.  A third line could have been added to the Russ march tables; or the tables could have been expanded to double dice results, with the Russ averaging less, to reduce the hot dice luck; or, Russ march rates could have been lowered for given dice ranges.  The 1-2-4-6 Russ table could have been 1-2-3-5, etc.  

But as it is, minimally "good" dice or "bad" dice for one side or other have a tremendous bearing on the outcome of the game.  One turn of "better" Russ rolls followed by a turn of "not so good" Ger rolls is all it takes to put the game out of the Ger reach, no matter how good they were doing prior.

Marne -- the strait-jacketing swim lanes for each Ger army may be historical, but really taint the feel of the thing.  I felt like I was going through a historical re-enactment drill on paper. Hey, you can drive it with no hands, ma; the rules will steer it for you.   

Colorwise -- and I admit this is a pet rock -- the armies/counter sets are bland as a stack of soup crackers.  Two step, 2 factor divisons, 1 step brigades.  No unique units, no flair to the color schemes, though the base counter colors are okay.  The overall counter/army visual appeal is akin to those scores of non-descript to horrid S&T counter sets in the 80s and 90s.  The only thing that could have had them hit even lower depths would be to have let one of the S&T art folks do the color schemes.

RATING: 8
Enjoyable quick and easy WWI sim. Simple but not simplistic. Interesting and unique command rules
Mind you: this is for people who are looking for a game with some good simulation flavors (not the other way around)
I found annoying the rule that allows you to recover step losses at the beginning of your turn rather than at the end.
This allows for gamey tactics (already in place 25 years ago in The Thirty Years War - SPI) of attacking units that have just attacked because they have been weakened during the combat. Hence, you are forced to be cautious and the game favors the defender.

UPDATE: As I find myself slowly moving away from higher-end, more complicated wargames, I am drawn back to trying this one again. Not sure if I'll actually do it or not, as CoG I now goes for some money on eBay (and here). But I'm in the position now that I'd try it again.
---
Neat game, low-complexity, but never seems to rise to the level of being played. Along with the contemporary Reds!, seems to be Ted Racier's experiments in odd combat resolution techniques. Realistically I probably won't play this again, as neither of the scenarios really grabbed me, but I am somewhat intrigued by Clash of Giants II.

This is another game that is probably a victim of my Euro habit. If I was a pure wargamer, this would get play, but because I enjoy eurogames also, wargames at this complexity and abstraction level compete for table time with eurogames, and that's a tough competition which they almost inevitably end up losing. Only the Columbia games seem to hold up OK.

High, high marks for delivering an engaging solitaire experience in a short amount of time.  Tannenberg will test any gamer, especially from the German side.  Still, that's not to say that making the most of a lumbering Russian horde doen't present its share of challenges, either.  Overall, it's a great example of a game where players have to eke the most out of a certain force mix and operational situation.

Despite the abstractions it makes to suit its lighter rules set, it delivers a solid sense of the historical situations it represents.

A winner, and a personal favorite.

I've only played the Tannenberg part of the package.

Fog of war is missing and I'm not sure how much the russian commanders knew about the fighting power of their german opponents. But these are general issues with the first test of fire in the east. The situation is very interesting, both sides can win and I like the small chance of success even the lower rated units have.

Tannenberg: 4
Felt like an old SPI, not very historical feel (garrisons can and should leave their location to create a front line). The game-play is particularly boring and the specific rules of limited Russian activation reinforce that aspect fortunately. It feels like this is the wrong scale or units or something.

RATING: 7
Interesting operational WWI game that has fairly low counter density and plays quickly. It definitely presents some challenges, and you must adapt your playing style to focus more on troop quality over raw odds.

The semi-variable movement is something I'm a fan of in general, but the corps commands are probably a little too swingy and could probably use a 2d6 table instead of the current 1d6 system.

The rulebook is the typically bad GMT/Raicer combo of an earlier day, and the living rules are absolutely essential to attempt to play this game. Even then you may run into questions, and you'll soon be scouring the CSW forums. Luckily I acquired this game long after the living rules were published, so it didn't affect me too much.

Anyway, overall it's a good game that should have some decent replayability.

RATING: 7
Very simple and playable wargame featuring two battles from the opening of World War I. Stunning maps, low counter density, simple rules, quick play time. Excellent stuff.  The only problem is reading a very simple 8 page book of standard rules, then having to "unlearn" them to learn another six pages of scenario rules.  I think custom rulebooks for each scenario may have been the way to go.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7.5
Slick system that is fast-playing with a minimum amount of rules referencing after your first game. Two games, each with their own map, help the replay value. I have extensively played the Tannenberg scenario (and my opponent beats me as the Russians every time), and I have only limited experience with the Marne scenario. I'm still not sure I like the "roll for front movement allowance" mechanic, but I got used to it over time. The focus is on playing the game and mastering your tactics, not on learning the rules. Overall, this game is better than what I was expecting. I am now a Ted Raicer fan.

It is easy to be turned off by this game when you consider the amount of units on the board.  That would be a silly mistake to make though, as herein lies a gem that defies preconceived notions of what makes a great wargame.  The minimalist approach to the important battles would at first seem limiting the possible strategies, but not so.  There plenty of options and probably like the commanders themselves, you are constantly forced to deal with the vagaries of the ACM rolls.  It is difficult to finally achieve a breakthrough only to bog down for a few turns of near immobility while the treasured price lies but an extra hex away.  Excellent game.  Thrilled to know that I have 4 battles on this great, simple and fast system.  Here's hoping that CoG III and beyond are made soon.

Solid wargame of two of the most important battles in history. Fairly simple and basically a classic hex wargame with special movement rules thrown in as well as the usual healthy dose of chrome that Raicer likes. Both scenarios strike me as being a real challenge for the Germans; this isn't an issue I have with the game, but something that I felt needed to be mentioned. More importantly each scenario is vastly different from the other, giving this game a lot of range.

Something prevents me from being more enthusiastic. As it is this game is a must of WWI gamers and should please just about any wargamer. It also helps that the rules are simple but the chrome keeps things real.

Finally found this for a reasonable price (on Essen'10).
It seems complete and is in pristine condition. The maps never seemed to be used, all counters are clipped and even the original little bags (and rubberband) was present.

UPDATE: It feels a bit more static then CoGII, because you only put in Allied ACM's in the turn and afterwards the Germans ACM's. Marne is nice campaign, although it favours the Allies heavily.

  Great, simple designs for effect, most notably the combat resolution system, which may result in defenders retreating in unorganized fashion, leaving comrades behind to man the line, and it's allowance for poor-quality attackers surviving combat only when in overwhelming numbers and aided by a few elite units; for Tannenberg, the variable MAs and German wireless intercept.  We've played Tannenberg three times and are looking forward to the Marne.  Highly recommended low-complexity wargame.

Solid WW1 game... one of the better ones actually. Tannenburg is interesting. Rules are pretty good and maps are nice and counters pretty standard. Low-complexity and ability for solitaire playing gives it a solid rating.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 7
Ted Racier specializes in WW1 simulation, which is a good thing given that there were so little good game on WW1 before his time.  Paths of Glory might have changed the picture from Monet to Picasso.  For me, WW1 looks like a future to me.  I like all the movies against the WW1 backdrop though, e.g. Jules et Jim, All Quiet on the Western Front, A very Long Engagement.  

The game also has a nice name.  2 standard maps.  Counters are simple and effective.  Unlike some other WW1 games (e.g. Dave Bolt's), game system is elegant and effects-over-processes. e.g. command problem simulated by a dieroll on the choice of the army by the German player over the Russians.  A very neat system to siulate the numerous "swirling" attack movements.

Simple combat resolution procedures where each participating units roll a die and compare the results to their tactical efficiency rating. The excess would be the no. of step loss, with maximum limit on the loss according to the odds and the terrain (i.e. forts). But I am curious why an operational level game would deal with tactical and not operational efficiency for a division. Another thing is the cavalry rule. Cavalry are not allowed to attack infantry. Somewhat contrary to understanding of my previous viewing of the WW1 footage. So the only eligible enemy unit would be the other side's cavalry. Guess this is what they were used as intended - to charge against cavalry. 

Many suggested Tannenberg has a more interesting situation. But I'd love to go for the Marne as objective Paris and the Effiel Tower are too tempting to play! Also, both sides are more even in this set-piece battle. I played the Tenneberg game but found that it was too one-sided affair with the Russian on the offensive all the time and it is hard for the German to counterattack locally or made up some plan to hold onto.

A strange mixture of the the staid and the (randomly applied) new.  

Classic 1970s ZOC-em-off wargaming with heavy reliance on factor counting (two major turnoffs for me) combined with chitpulls - except the chitpulls have no effect except keeping you from knowing the movement value of other armies ahead of time.  There are army boundaries - except units can generally mingle across army boundaries without ill effects and attack freely.  

The strange CRT (you roll for the damage to your own units) completes the picture.  It seamlessly combines the disadvantages of rolling per individual unit (more chances for blowout results) with those of an odds-based CRT: the need to looking up on a table (though admittedly, after one game, you have that memorised) but more importantly heavy reliance on factor counting.

Both the Marne and Tannenberg were heavily influenced by fog of war. Any attempt to show those two battles in a dedicated game should attempt to involve mechanisms that involve not knowing where the enemy is.  Instead all we get is some variation of movement factors.

Finally, victory. This is a system that spends a lot of rules on army demoralisation - yet in the Marne scenario, victory conditions are in that crudest of terms, a pile of obscure little towns held or not. Overall, the grand spectacle of one of the major turnovers of WW1 is instead shown as being about counting little stars on the map.

A good relatively simple game.  I played with my wife who has never played a war game in her life prior to this game.  She grasped the concept pretty quickly (and did a fair job as well).

Now have played Tannenberg.  These is an interesting scenario, plays well solo as the Russian player has generally less operational freedom than the German.  The German player has the challenge.

***


Only played the Marne so far.  There are a lot of restrictions on what you can do and few serious strategic options in this scenario.  I also am not sure about the combat system.  In about 80% of the cases it seems you do a lot of die rolling to get results that could easily have been handled in a single roll on a conventional CRT.

RATING: 4
Despite some good design ideas, the game tends too dependent on luck. The Marne game is not interesting, because you had to roll for movement and if the Allies are quick, they will win, otherwise the Germans will win. Tannenberg is more challenging, but it is not possible to create the flair of the historic situation and the Russians will win the most games.

A beautifully presented game that plays well.  In the West, the Marne "Allies counter-attack" scenario picks up where many games leave off.  On the Eastern front the Germans have a challenge in the Tannenberg game as the Russians simply out number them: a good quality vs. quantity match up.  Rules make for a playable game system that welcomes solitaire sessions.  A fine balance of historical detail and playability.  Well done.

My only complaint is that I'm not sure how replayable this is.

Tannenberg: Too much depends on the movement die rolls, especially early on as pinning the Russians against the board edges may be the only hope for the Germans. Otherwise the Russians use their greater numbers to outflank the German line. Only attack 2-step units at 4:1+ odds and 1-step units at 2:1 with a 2-step unit.
Perhaps the Germans need to move Cav and 1st Corps to Russian 2nd Army flank and press to surround while falling back only as needed against 1st Army.
This might be better as a solitaire game as it is neither history nor balanced.

Nice to know there's a place called Wormditt.

I've only played Tannenberg. I'm not sure about replayability, but it was a fun game. Great, understated components, thoughtful rules with just enough spice (cavalry, replacements, etc), and quick intense action. Accuracy, I don't know about that, though. The Germans are thin, the Russians can usually move as much as they'd like, and they get three times the replacements. 

Like Cannae, Antietam, and others, this battle's results seem hard to replicate. But maybe the point is to give you the moving parts, and let you go at it, knowing that such dramatic results as the surrounding and capture of a whole army will not happen. Really, without double blind or some such limited intelligence, I don't see how you could expect much else.

Interesting portrayal of operational warfare in the War to End All Wars.

[Based on one play of Tannenburg:]
Movement is actually determined by die roll, but it works because the command tables are just predictable enough to form a plan, but unpredictable enough to ruin your plan at just the wrong time.  Similarly, combat is all about making saving throws, with relative numbers merely modifying the save targets.  Cavalry features moderately prominently, especially compared to the conventional wisdom, operating as screening units - though cavalry may be a little too effective.  Overall, an easy-to-get-into and pleasurable experience - I look forward to trying Galicia from CoG2!

2 plays of Tannenberg so far.  Excellent hex and counter wargame.  Rules aren't overly complicated and its sets up and plays quickly.  Tannenberg is a very evenly matched and provides a very tense game.

The Tannenberg scenario is quite playable. I think I played this about half a dozen times.
The Marne scenario is a little boring, though.

Excellent WW1 effort that is only marred by a bit too much errata and clarifications. Short rules, very accessible, fun, rich and plays great solo, too. I don't have much experience with Marne, but Tannenberg is very highly recommended (a classic!).

Simple game but also too simplistic & not very exciting. I do not like the movement system which may provoke some odd situation (a blitzkrieg from russian 2nd army rolling 6s in Tannenberg). Fast playing though & easy to learn for newbies.

Some of the low ratings are bizarre; for example, "nice components, clear rules" = a 3!!??

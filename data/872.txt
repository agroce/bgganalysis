An abstract game with kind of a lot going on. It's not too complicated or anything, but it seems like a bunch of ideas thrown together into a abstract game.

One play with six players and I was the victim of turn order. I didn't get my choice of tiles because the player to my left kept making all the scoring opportunites. Would play again with fewer participants.

Tentative rating after 1 play.  After playing for 5 minutes, I suddenly realized, "Hey, this is Qwirkle", but with a couple of extra mechanics layered in.  My one play was with 6 people.  Definitely doable, but I think that 3 or 4 is probably the sweet spot.  With more people it becomes much more tactical, with less ability to plan.

RATING: 8
Unlike anything else I have played.  Difficult to plan much in advance,  as the "board" can change dramatically at almost any time.  Quick and played well with 5.

RATING: 7.5
Somehow our Abacus games keep their shrink wrapping a lot longer than those of very similar companies. So for no good reason it took us forever to discover some genuine, but underexposed gems. [i]Maya[/i] for instance, I would still like to see getting more table time than it does, but after finally having cracked the seal on M today, it looks like Maya's spot in my imaginary queue has now been comfortably claimed by this abstract tile-placement and set-collecting beauty.

It is frequently suggested here that a fitting theme would have been a great addition, but I respectfully disagree. When you have a mechanism this crisp and clear, its a bit like dangling a flashing neon light off the Louvre's glass pyramid to draw attention to it. Sometimes a naked abstract [i]is[/i] the most befitting theme its style guru could have chosen.

Sure, maybe the cards could have been a bit prettified, and printed on slightly thicker cardboard. But it won't be long until the wealth of placement considerations begins to dawn on players, and suddenly it is obvious that the simple design is so functional that players are barely aware of the design. As it should be.

There are many clever mechanism choices I like about this game. High up that list is the subtle ways to force opponents into drawing tiles they are desperate to avoid. But mostly the rather simple approach, that of the five set players could end up with, the best two totals will be positive scores, the remainder are points to be subtracted. Hideously effective in creating a pretty unique game, and potentially far more attractive to gamers than similar reveal-and-collect games like Set, where the ability to match sets is mainly determined by brain speed, rather than strategic decision making. In this game, the more considerate your placement, the better you will do. And you have far more influence over making your desired tile sets available than a quick glance suggests. A pleasant challenge.

There are very few rules that make the game, and they all feel obvious and natural, as if they were meant to be one considerate whole. A superbly designed game. It plays very fast too, and I can see this become a welcome filler that won't bore easily. Mister Schlegel's recent Aqua Romana is already a firm hit with us. Hekla is one that has immediately drawn my attention. So it now looks like he has indeed matured quickly from his early Spielbox game inserts designs, and is more than a one-hit wonder. Simple abstracts and intriguing placement games might well be his [i]forte[/i], with set collection a focus for sure. An emerging designer I will now watch a lot closer than I have. Thoroughly recommended.

UPDATE: We habe decided that a pick-up is only forced on a complete row of 6, and have added an extra 10 tiles to the starting pile to make up for the higher number of tiles left on the table. It made puzzling for placement more of a challenge and stopped each emerging row of 4 immediately being scored by adding a fifth.

Lots of luck in the tile draws, but this is one of my favorite abstract games. Scales well for 2-6 players, and it's pretty good for non-gamers. "M" is an ideal filler, warm-up or end-of-the-night game. My only complaint is it IS NOT color-blind friendly.

RATING: 9
Really enjoy the game. Simple rules to explain and fun to play. I like the choices that I have on my turn i.e. where to place the tiles and either create a situation that benefits me, while messing up my opponents at the same time. I am not found of the graphics but if you look past that, it is game that most beginners and gamers would enjoy.

Quite fun game with a twist that you can destroy for the other players, with a scoring round. Also nice that you take points from the player to the right when you score larger groups of tiles.
A bit dry as there are no theme in the game. But I get the feeling that this is a let-us-play-just-one-more-time game which is fun.
A good filler game, as you can play it rather quick.

The tagline of this game reads 'mega fun with mini rules', but after playing through a number of games, most of them 2P, I'm not so sure about either. A long time ago, when I was still wasting my time playing computer games instead of seeking out female companionship, I stumbled across a game called Alchemy. You can find it [url=http://www.popcap.com/games/free/alchemy?mid=alchemy_pcweb_en_full]here[/url]. It's a quiet puzzle game in which you try to turn a slab of lead into gold piece by piece by arranging magical runes with different shapes and colours on it according to a very simple rule: neighbouring runes must share at least one characteristic, namely shape or colour. It becomes really hard pretty fast, which is why I never played it for long. M is Alchemy in boardgame format with a few changes.

M is a simple abstract tile laying game in which players try to add tiles with abstract drawings and 3 characteristics each (colour, value and center image) on them into a grid of at most 6 by 6. At least one aspect of a tile much match that of an immediate neighbour; if the tile is placed adjacent to two tiles, both neighbours each have at least one similarity, and so forth. You get chips (worth 10 points each) from your right neighbour for particularly good placements. If you make a row 5 or 6 cards long, [i]and[/i] the card you place shares [i]two[/i] aspects with an arbitrary neighbour, the game is momentarily halted. You are then allowed to pick up any card from that row as long as it doesn't cut the cards already placed into two or more separate 'islands', they must remain a single interconnected whole. You do this because such cards are worth points: at the end you count up the cards in two colours you have the most points of, and deduct the points from the other colours. (Yes, that sounds a lot like Coloretto.) Chips add a little extra, highest score wins.

All in all, albeit being easily explained, the rules are really not that mini, and contain a few weird frills. Do they result in a 'mega fun' game? No, I don't think so. I have a pretty good hunch that the author started out with the placement mechanic and created a game around it, since it feels a bit too artifical. The cards you need to place are drawn at random, and you can never be sure that someone doesn't start a pick-up round cheating you out of that high value card you've had your eyes on for a while now. It's not even a given that [i]you[/i] can initiate one because of the 2-characteristic rule. Tactics are therefore relegated to picking up a clever card once there is an opportunity to do so, but this doesn't happen that often. About 80 to 90% of the time you will be staring at the grid, wondering where there is a match sufficiently valuable to cheat an opponent out of his chips. Given that the game takes about 45 to 60 minutes to play, it is simply overasking the core idea.

Therefore I think M is top-heavy, trying to stretch things to a point where they aren't meant to go. That feeling won't sbsisde if you take it less seriously. There are no funny jokes to tell (it being an abstract) and the artwork isn't as clear as you would like, although it does the job tolerably well. Mini rules, perhaps; but mega fun, no.

The play will remind you a bit of Set as you try to match a characteristic on your tile to one on one or more previously played tiles. Some short-term planning is possible with fewer players, when the board doesn't change so much between turns. Even with fewer players, though, it's difficult to force a player to take a card he doesn't want, except by accident. You're better off to focus on setting yourself up and on avoiding hosing yourself.

Enjoyed this more than I expected. It is abstract, which is not usually my favorite, but it is light enough to be fun without a lot of thought as well enough of a game to reward thought. 

Easy to learn and easy to teach.

Plus it's always fun to screw other players.

A tile placement games with a ruleset that isn't as intuitive as it claims to be. It's certainly not as difficult as it is ugly, however.

One play. This abstract tile laying thing didn't do much for me. Too much effort involved for too little payoff. At least you have a hand of tiles instead of the draw-one-play-one frustration of Carcassonne. Deconstructing the board is kind of interesting but can hose the last players to draw. I'd rather not play it again.

I played this years ago with Dave Vander Ark and Leon at a Gulf Games.  I recalled it as a fun and easy to play game.

Years later (2013) "M" is now a part of my collection.  We played it twice in a row, and it was well received by all three players.

The game has a significant luck factor.  But it also rewards good observation and allows for tactical play.  We played with 3, and that seemed good.  It is rated as up to 6, which might make the game too chaotic.  But I suspect we'll give it a try with a big group, as it seems like a worthy filler.

I found this game engaging although there is definitely luck of the draw in pulling tiles.  Basically, this is a set collection game in which you score positive points for 2 different colors and negative for any other colors.

Fun, theme-less game that's easy to learn, plays quickly, and has interesting scoring mechanics. Luck of the draw is a (minor) factor, which can leave you frustratingly stymied on occasion. Unlike some, I kinda like the look of the game. Works well for two or three; more players just means less and less control and more and more waiting for your turn. [owned since 2008; 5 plays]

Note 1: the author's first name could have been been Wally or Wilma without disturbing the initial setup.

I wish this excellent abstract game had a theme so those that don't like abstracts wouldn't just write it off. The mechanics, especially the scoring, are very interesting and the gameplay is simple to teach but has enough depth to appeal to those that like heavier games. I like it just fine the way it is, but the lack of theme has definitely caused this to suffer from a lack of playing time in our group because of some others' dislike of abstract games.

The first way of scoring is by playing to the 6x6 grid and bordering against as many tiles as you can. Each tile other than the first will allow you to steal 10 points from the player who just played (they set you up after all), but of course you can only border against a tile if an attribute matches on both. The second way is to trigger an end of line condition by matching 2 or 3 attributes against an existing tile when that row/column already has 4 or 5 tiles in it. Players claim tiles in that row/column in turn, aiming to take only the 2 colours they want but you may be forced to take a bad colour if another player plans it out well. There's lots of luck in the tiles you get and in what the player to your right plays, whether you can match or not. Once you start collecting two colours, you want to get more and more of those played out to the grid to maximise your chances of picking them up later. It's abstract obviously, and probably 15 minutes longer than a filler / opener should be, so it doesn't get into the rotation much as a result, but it's enjoyable enough when it does because it's simple, provides a nice decision each turn and is a contrast to standard fare.

M is a nice tile laying game. The graphics design seems dated, and doesn't make the Set-like mechanism of recognizing differences/similarities between cards any easier.

RATING: 6.5
The game is easy, the graphics are awful: wouldn't it be much fun if there were ducks, cars or roads instead of abstract 3D symbols?
Choices some times look equivalent to each others, with two players.
I've got some doubts about the usefulness of getting all the coins from the previous player: this gives a useless random to the game.

The name doesn't make sense; for a little tile layer there are a fair amount of corner cases that the rules deal with.  The box says 2-6, but do not play with 6.  Don't even play with 5.  4 is borderline.

Meh.  Felt a little chaotic and random with 4.  Might be a more interesting game with 2 or 3, especially if played with face up tiles.  A little more interesting than Carat, but not by much.

RATING: 7
This game looks like it would be terrible but it is surprisingly deep and subtle.  I think it would be even better with a hand size of 6 (rather than 4) to allow a bit more planning.  But there are a lot of interesting dynamics between the scoring rules, scoring trigger rules, and tile placement incentives.

This game is good in its own right, and especially good given that it came from 2000.  Ahead of its time and quite enjoyable!

It is very good with 3 players, but I don't know if it will be good with other numbers.  It may well fall apart.

RATING: 6
Interesting abstract.  I can certainly predict the consequences of my moves, but I'm less certain I have a ton of control, or the ability to plan ahead and set up plays that will score well for me and hurt others, or to dodge my negative colors.  So I can't tell how great this is yet.

--Jun2015-- Intriguing semi-abstract.  The tile randomness makes it a bit fluffier and more family friendly than one might otherwise expect from an "abstract".  It's easy enough to explain and play; and works (mechanically) quite well.  Not sure what the arc between here and competence looks like, though!

Absztrakt jatek, de nagyon szorakoztato megis. A lapkak lerakasi modszere egy kicsit korlatozott, megis tul sok lehetoseg adodik idonkent. A pontozasi rendszere abszolut megegyezik a coloretto jatekaval. Nekem tetszett, nem hosszu es azert lehet rajta gondolkodni.
Update1: Egyre jobban tetszik meglepo modon.

RATING: 5
My rating is almost certainly due to playing this with 6 (way too many people). Lots of chaos, as plans are obliterated by someone scoring and changing the board completely. It's a matter of hoping the person to your right set you up, and trying not to set up the person to your left. Of course, that's hard to determine since you don't know what's in their hand of randomly drawn tiles.

Light game, easy to play. Players add tiles to an invisible 6x6 grid. Each player gets a stack of 10 point tokens. Most tiles have three attributes (color, symbol, and number), each player gets four tiles and draws back up to four at the end of their turns. Pieces played must match with all edges of adjacent tiles (a corner play has two edges, for instance, so you must match your playing tile and with both tiles its touching). Tiles match if they share any characteristic. To play a corner, you may use different matching criteria for each match. Matching two tiles on your play allows you to steal one token (worth 10 points) from the player on your right. Matching three allows you to steal two tokens, and matching four (difficult to do) nets you three. When five or six tiles in a row appear, a quick round is played in reverse, where each player in turn claims one tile from the row (so long as a claim does not "split" the tiles, as all tiles on the board must be connected). Then regular play resumes. Claimed tiles are left face up in front of you, with the numbers counting as score at game end. You may only pick two colors to score, if you have more colors they count negatively against yout score. Add the total to the number of tokens you have left and that's your final score. Really, it's very easy to learn with visual examples. Not hard to play at all. Cute filler. Score might drop after more playings as I'm not sure there are any hard decisions to make in this game.

Csúnya, de finom. Absztrakt játék, amiből sok más játék építkezett a jövőben. Gyors szabályismertetés, minden játékosszámmal jól működő lapkalerakós játék, ahol néha nem azért jó kiváltani egy értékelést, hogy minél több pontot sikerüljön vele szerezni, hanem, hogy az ellenfelek minél többet bukjanak. Ettől függetlenül nem kell félni a magas konfrontációtól, mert kevésbé szól erről a játék. Az ár/érték aránya nagyon magas.

RATING: 6.5
I'm not sure if there is a whole lot to this game, but it is a nice tactical abstract.  The first part of the game feels a bit matter of fact with most of your decisions being pretty obvious, but as the game progresses and it becomes apparent that the game comes in the deconstruction of the board over the construction. As bits start getting chipped away the tactics become much more intriging.  That said I feel that there is always going to be a best move to make with the hand that you are given and once you know the game dynamics it won't take much of an effort to figure out what it is. With this in mind, it doesn't make the game any less entertaining.

Interesting game that combines ideas from Qwirkle (matching or not matching of symbols), Coloretto (final scoring), and Laterns (tile placmement), though this game predates all three I believe. I think the graphic design could use an update. For some reason I didn't find the rules as intuitive as it should be for such a game of this weight.

I kind of enjoyed this one, the scoring was a little random almost in that you could seriously benefit if the person to your left lays a scoring tile, but seriously be hindered if the person to your right does.  Made up for a little bit with the disks that can change hands.

Quick lite, fun little game, would play it again.

Interesting enough pattern matching and set collecting game, but the wonky mechanics don't seem to add much to the game and I never feel like I have any control over my own destiny. I've never tried anything other than a basic strategy and I've both won and gotten killed.

Traded. I'm not big on abstract games but I like this game a lot. You don't need to over-analyze the board and it basically comes down to having the right tiles at the right time. It comes in a huge flat box which is ridiculous. I fit the tiles and the bits into two sandwich baggies.

RATING: 5.5
Cheap production and horrible graphics aside.  M is ultimately a highly forgettable abstract that merely plays okay.  The only interesting element is that the scoring (or more accurately the deconstruction of the board) is done in a counter-clockwise fashion.  So now you have a way to affect the player immediately before you where as in most games you would not otherwise have the opportunity to.  I feel that the game can end up being lopsided if someone is able to invest in one single color with no competition; and that the chips are potentially too powerful in terms of the bonus they grant in the final tally.  M just doesn't have the kind of mechanics that scream "play me", even if it's not that bad.

Neat game, but your scoring can be very biased depending on who is sitting next to you.  With 5 or 6 players, you may get shut out of a lot of scoring rounds.

Interesting tactical challenges await you in M.  Plotting your move to maximize your benefit while maximizing others' detriments can be interesting; however, for the most part, you're carried by the waves of what transpires in the game.  This does, of course, provide a nicely unpredictable game.

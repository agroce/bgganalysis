130929  Maybe I need to give Scepter and Outpost a second try...but I'm pretty sure I just don't enjoy this family of games.  I will not play Phonecia due to its component issues.  Once again a game I will most likely avoid except under duress.

110220 may well go down after a couple more plays, but I definitely enjoyed it factors more than SvZ.  I like the old artwork too, and I'm afraid the new one may ruin it's clunky charm =)

Best with only a few players, anything above 5 and the downtime in auctions is just tedious. Does unfortunately suffer from runaway leader syndrome though, although this is to be expected in this style of game.

I played this once at the start of the year and really enjoyed it, primarily because it looks like it scales better than Scepter of Zavendor in that you can play multiple hands easier for fewer players to keep the auctions interesting, it was good news to hear of a reprint and I have since purchased a copy so I need to get this to the table to see if it will live up the hype I've built up for it over the year, hopefully the dice rolling won't spoil its future.

Update: I liked it but it really broke other players as the range of numbers is vast so your mental arithmetic needs to be great to do all the purchases. 

Sceptor of Zavendor is likely the better game though I'll never play Outpost wit hthe right sort of players that much to really compare.

RATING: 9
I love this game!  Auction-driven and entirely about constructing a viable economic engine within your worker and hand limit constraints.  Income (via card draws with each good having a range of possible values) is wildly variant.  Good draws are awesome, bad ones are crushing.

Definitely not for everyone.  Definitely for me.  I've had amazing games and horrible ones.  Sometimes it works out and sometimes it crushes you mercilessly and there's nothing you can do.  Know this, live it, learn it, love it or perish (and perish?).
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.8
Only one play.  An auction-based economy-builder with nothing much else going on, and as a result perhaps just a bit too subject to runaway leader snowballing.  From reviews here, it seems clear ours was an unusually long game, in which players regularly sat out the auction round (this because of the order upgrades came out), and so the regular adding and re-adding of cards in the hand became tedious.  There's also quite a variance issue with this one: since the last three upgrades (producing the big dollars) are only used once or twice before the end of the game, swings in the luck of what you get there seem game-deciding; again, the order that upgrades come out at the start of phase 2 seems to lift or kneecap players a little too much.  6.8 means that I'd certainly play it again, but with some reservations.

RATING: 7
Outpost is a game for 4 to 8 players.  Each player assumes the role of a colony commander placed on the planet Janna 36C, It's rich in ore and other resources. You must mine the factories to produce income for future updgrades. The colony upgrades are brought on a supply ship once a turn. There's one less of each type of colony upgrade than players. To make it worse, you cannot just buy what you want, all purchases are done by auction. When it's your turn, you ask to purchase the item your in need of, then everyone gets to bid on it. You must manage the factories, and if you cannot support the human popluation, you need to consider robots to do the dirty work. Robots help in getting income from the factories, yet do not contribute to the victory points needed to win. The first person to reach 75 victory points is declared the winner and is chosen by the Terrain Confederation to manage the overall planetary development.

Expected playing time is about 2.5 - 3 hours.

RATING: 5
Funky little bidding game. I like the cards/techs or whatever, but the 'chunky' money that offers no change is both interesting and maddening in how mind consuming the math can be to maximize your auction efficiency. The game also builds up to a ton of AP inducing weight all of a sudden towards the end and you're either ready for it with your setup or you're not.

I guess I can appreciate this on a historical (1991)level but, with its problems and unattractive bits....leaves me cold.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
For it's time, 1991, this was definitely an incredibly worthy game with some noteworthy design features (groundbreaking?):  randomized money draws (fun?), economic and victory point engine building, capability upgrades (Hansa Teutonica anyone?) in this case obtained through auctions, future discounts auctioned off (an interesting idea), and the very modest, but nevertheless, interesting mechanic, "mega money" taken by players who do not want to "push their luck" with randomized money draws (a straightforward feature in the game that attracts little attention, but fascinating, I think, from a game design point of view...the designer is explicitly underscoring the randomness feature/problem? of his game and then...ameliorating it? Or is he?  Interesting.) 

All in all, Outpost is an interesting game, but not necessarily fireworks, or inordinate amounts of fun in the year 2012. 

Lots of (ahem...better) games out there today that can satisfy your desire to build economic and VP engines...compete in auctions...and/or upgrade your capabilities.

What a great game. Shines with the kicker expansion . Hats off to Stronghold games for producing this gem and making it so it plays up to 9 out the box.
Some similarities to Avalon Hills Civilization ( that I rate a 10) , in the card resource draw, but this game is very much it's own beast and a real joy to play. 

Love it love it love it!

After several plays at differing player counts... raised to a 9.

RATING: 6.5
First Play: New edition played in March 2012. Even considering this was first produced in 1991 this would still have been considered a cumbersome game (IMHO) back then. Perhaps one of the early runners that encouraged players to build an engine, churn cash, buy facilities that discount further buys etc, but this is a grinding experience where you are constantly forced to crunch numbers to see what permutations are possible with the cards dealt. A process that for me long overstayed its welcome.

The game drags to start with few points being gleened. Then at the end as the big cards are released there is a ground rush of vps as points are awarded in 15's and 20's.

I'm not keen on the randomness of the cards when you have 3 or less production buildings (despite the 4 token fixed value card) and this does odds the balance in the early turns. Draw some low values and miss those key purchases and that falter will hamper you for the rest of the game.

More hard work than a fun game and more randomness than I think is healthy in a game of skill. Little or no interaction with other players beyond the auctions, this is primarily a solo game. Not to be bought and I doubt to be played again.

Not a bad game but so looooooong for what it is. A snowballing, economic engine game like this has to be pretty special if it is going to take you through the 3 hour mark. Unfortunately this is not that special, the game has very little to hold the attention of the player(s) who discover after an hour that they are behind the curve and never going to win.

Must have been pretty impressive when it first came out 20 years ago, but now showing its age.

RATING: 5
When all the negatives of a game can be summed up by saying it’s overpriced it is very likely the game itself is quite good: and certainly Outpost is a game you wouldn’t expect. Actually at first glance I was very wary about Outpost: even if the graphics is clean and nice-looking, themed as a well-fitting and kind of retro science fiction, the lack of any tangible components but shovelfuls of counters scared me, for it looked like the umpteenth game hastily assembled to comply with an impending deadline.

Yet it took just a couple of turns to win me over and make me change my mind: Outpost is a carefully bevelled and oiled game running smoothly and creating that deeply personal experience a game has to do for the players to plunge into. As a matter of fact, Outpost is all about collecting and manging resources like an eurogame but, unlike those, it is also warm, enthralling and displays a solid theme: interactions with the other players are minimal but very intense, such as it happens when an auction is going on.

Nonetheless, the «20th anniversary deluxe edition» I played is still a full-cardboard game sold as dear as it were a component-heavy game: I’m wondering with some concern what the basic edition’s materials could be like. [i](October 2011)[/i]

[b]Update I[/b] - After further playing it, in January 2012 I convinced myself Outpost clearly has three serious issues.

First: this game is an eurogame in its core. Yes, Outpost shows off simple but nice looking classic-SF graphics; yes, no eurogame dared to meddle with science-fiction so far; and yes, there are no wooden cubes to push on the board, just cardboard tokens: nonetheless the resource management and the forced «build better factories to have more money» mechanics still feel like an eurogame. The setting is still warmer and the interaction among players more lively than your typical eurogame usually provides though.

Second: this isn’t a forgiving game. You won’t be allowed to recover any mistake you did in the early game: you can catch up with the other players only if they make some mistakes as well. Shouldn’t they, you will never be able to come back and be a contender for the success: they will always have much more money than you indeed, hence they can’t be seriously opposed in any auction. As soon as you realize you’re hopelessly out of the game, your playing gets too long and boring.

Third: in mid to late game you are required to make extensive calculations at every turn in order to make out how much money you have just collected. So the players’ attention is focused mainly on the cards they have in their hands rather than on the game itself, which means they end by just ignoring the auctions they aren’t interested in (more or less what happens in any eurogame): so the game gets much less heated and drags wearily to the end. On the other hand though, these calculations start funny situations around the table: when the players are silently doing their calaculations, they will likely be moving their lips, gesticulating, staring into the nothingness and keeping such behaviours to concentrate on the maths. It’s a funny show to watch from outside.

Given all of these, I had to lower my rating from 8 to 7. [i](January 2012)[/i]

[b]Update II[/b] - I haven’t been playing Outpist for several years now and don’t feel any interest in doing it any time soon: thus, considering the heavy eurogame issues it has, during my Fall 2015 rating revise it looked appropriate to me to lower it from 7 to 5.
I don’t think I will play Outpost again and, if I’ll ever do, it will be forced on me.

My understanding is the game is better with jore as the auctions ae more exciting, etc.  But, for me this lacked a bit of fun or room to explore and/or be creative in your approach.  So, it ended up okay, butnothing I'm going to clamorabout or even try to acquire. I think it might be too much math and min/max for me.

Played a few games now of the new version. I like the game but it may be a bit long for what it does. Games have gone about 45 min. per person right now and we usually play with 4 players so you're looking at at least 3 hours for the game which is longish for the return in depth. Components and rulebook are great and there is a lot of different strategies and good choices to make throughout. Break out that calculator though! You will be using it towards the latter half of the game.

RATING: 6
There is some good challenge here and a few different ways you can build your colony, but it takes FAR, FAR, FAR, FAR, FAR too long and the 'first player to 75VP' is too restrictive. If this had been designed today, it would play in 2 hours and have variable victory conditions. It was a fun blast from the past, but doubt I would be prepared to commit the time to it again.

I don't see the appeal of this one - other than the rarity value for a collector. You certainly don't get much
in the way of components.

Game play - overly long, very repetative with a definite "rich get richer, poor fall behind" effect meaning you
have to get a good start or you know you're out of it before the game is even half way through.

Wasn't that taken with it when I played it 15 years ago, a more recent try confirmed my fears, never gonna play this one again and it hit the trade pile. *** update Traded my copy

Simple, streamlined Civ building auction game.  The box says about 25 minutes per player and so far that's been about right.

Player's have different types of factories.  Each different type of factory produces a different type of money card (i.e. range of money values).  Each round, every powered (needs a worker or robot) factory produces a money card.  Players can then bid on upgrades (enables different types of factories, more workers, increased hand size, etc), build more factories, or higher more workers.  Most points when someone breaks 75 points wins;.

Based on first and last play in 2012:

By today's standards, horribly boring. Wash, rinse, repeat. Zzzzzzz. Bid, build some factories, calculate VPs, get some income, zzzzzzz. 3 hours of doing the same thing 50 times. And add numbers on your money cards like you're in grade 3 math class.

I was winning for much of the game until the last turn. And I still didn't care what the outcome was. Runaway leader problem in which the bottom 4 players had no chance of catching up and winning and this was 1 hour into a 3 hour snorefest.

Some interesting ideas, but really multi-player solitaire, only one or two valid strategies, and no way to catch up once you get behind. Enjoyable the first time or two, but crashed awfully hard after that, and I have no desire to play it again. When I did play it again recently I was amazed at how poor it was compared to modern stuff. Oh, for the days of the late 80s/early 90s, when good games were scarce and we were pretty much thrilled with whatever we got.

Fun and complex game.  I can't imagine how complicated this would be if a full 9 players were to try playing this.  With 4 players, there were cards scattered everywhere, and everyone continually struggled to keep a coherent tally of his available credits.

This is definitely a game which severely punishes early missteps.  If you fall behind early, it isn't likely that you will be able to recover and be competitive.  Once the gulf between the haves and the have-nots appears, it is there to stay.  I'm not sure how much I enjoy playing a game where your fate has largely been decided roughly halfway through.

I enjoyed this on my initial play until about half way through when I realised that the leaders were always going to earn more than me and that the gap was simply going to widen during the second half. Since there is no way to haul the leader(s) back again this quickly lost its charm. The theme is okay but it feels quite abstract and there's no interesting player interaction to speak of. This design is really showing its age.

No thanks.  Not interested.  Played once -- that was enough and I won't make that mistake again.  I do not like economic snowball games.  This is not to say it is a bad game, just that it is a game which specialises in things I don't like and am not interested in.  This is a game that is clearly a member of the "I'd rather go home alone in the dark than play this game again" set.

Update: played the new edition and am somewhat less severe on it than I was.  Rating raised to 2.5.

RATING: 9
Famous money management game which scales extremely well for different numbers of players.  Your first couple of games you may feel there is a "leader runs away with it" situation, but once you're used to the mechanics this should happen less and the game should become very tight.
A little note: Really really DONT count your cards to work out how to pay each amount (without losing money) during an auction.  Work out what your maximum bid is and bid up to this point, then work out how to pay (you may need to overpay slightly if yr unlucky).  In games where players don't do this it can get deadly slow...

One two player game.
Provisionally, I prefer Sceptor of Zavandor to Outpost.  I found the end game, of Outpost especially the last three turns, to be pointless.  The winner was obvious and nothing could be done to change that.  In such games, playing the game to the end seems a needless exercise.  I do not recall experiencing this in Sceptor.  It may be that Outpost plays less well than Sceptor with only two players.

Outpost is my original favorite Euro style owned game.  This TimJim game, released in 1991, was original in its time.  I also own the 20th Anniversary Edition of the game released by Stronghold Games which keeps 98% of the original TimJim game intact.  Once called the "Holy Grail" of Euro games, Outpost is a fantastic game of colonization mining in space, while ramping up production, seemingly exponentially increasing your yield of resource credits each turn, directly competing with your fellow miners for technologies brought to the fringe of the universe available for sale, and finally being the first player to the 75 victory point threshold - hopefully for the win.  The bidding mechanism makes the game and the availability of the 13 types of technology cards - and how they become available - really stirs up the paths to victory and forces players to adjust their strategies accordingly.  I really like Outpost with 4 or 5 players - although it handles one of the widest varieties of players at the table, but bogs down with 7 or more.  I love the bidding mechanism and "working players over" in the process.  Although you can't technically bluff, Outpost gives a little bit of a bluffing feel to the game and most players that enjoy playing poker tend to do well at reading and exploiting players during game play.  This is my favorite "classic" euro game of all time!!!
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6.5
A good game, in many ways a classic, but becoming outdated now. The major drawback is the significant maths involved because of the odd values on the income tokens. JKLMs update (Phoenicia) is much easier to play and doesn't really loose anything from the original. I guess it is probably time this one was retired gracefully.

This is a pure optimization, resource collection game (although there's nothing that distinguishes the resources, other than their value--all resources just contribute towards one's cash). There is no story or theme here at all. 

Collect your cash from resources. Buy more resource-generating buildings, or purchase technologies that give you VPs and maybe discounts on other technologies. Do this for 10 turns or so and see who has the most points. 

Spend 5 minutes counting up all your cash cards in your hand. Then another 5 minutes deciding what to do on your turn. Then another 5 minutes to figure out how to pay for your purchase in such a way as to avoid overpaying (you don't get change!). Now, I'm exaggerating a bit, but you get the point.

Wow.  I finally got to play this when I purchased the reprint, and I really, really like it.  So far there hasn't been a dominant strategy discovered by my group.  Difernt paths to victory seem viable.  Everyone seems pretty closely matched, at least unitl the Era 3 cards come out, then 1 or 2 slip behind, but at least at that point there is only a couple of turns left to play.

Haven't tried the Kicker expansion yet, as I'm saving it for when the base game seems "samey."

I like Scepter of Zavandor better, but this one is also fun to own.  I like the theme better, and I like the greater variety in economy builds.  SoZ is better at stopping the runaway leader.  I haven't had a chance to play Outpost with the Kickers yet.

1/13/13: I've reversed my opinion.  I like Outpost better.  With good players, certain positions in SoZ become nearly unwinable.  Outpost starts everyone on an even keel, which I prefer.  I do not care for the kickers for the most part (especially the trader cards).

8/21/13: We play w/ the kickers (less the traders), and I've found that I like them.

Classic cash/resources->points game. I've only played with the "expert rules" which seems to address some of the complaints listed here. It IS still almost impossible to reign in the leader and the accelerating nature means your early card draws are disproportionately important.
I like these kind of games and this one was fun, but Zepter von Zavandor is much better looking. (What's with the yellow & white on the research cards? Aiiee, my retinas are on fire!)

There is a good game in here somewhere, but there is too much going on for my taste.  It muddies up the things that I like.  So it is challenging, but not very much fun.  I could be convinced to play it again, but I know it will never WOW me.  It is simply too cerebral and without enough social interaction.   I am also a sucker for good bits which this game sorely lacks.  So too much accounting and not enough bling!  If I had to, I would play one of the other renditions of this game (Scepter of Zavandor or Phoenicia).  But for now, I'm looking for something a little shorter, a little simpler, prettier, and with more player interaction.

RATING: 7
Having played SoZ first, I kind of knew what to expect with this game.  It's a fun economic engine game like SoZ, but it is simpler.  It is missing some of the key strategy decisions in SoZ.  If this game had been originally published after SoZ it would have gotten a 6.  But I give it a 7 because it was pre-dates SoZ plus it has a better theme.

My preference would be to always play SoZ over this one.  If only SoZ had the Outpost theme somehow.

This is a deeply influential game design that has been mined by a lot of modern designers. It is an economic engine game with wide-open auctions for "civilization" style  technologies, insofar as they grant various abilities or future discounts. 

The whole thing is rather math-y, heavily rewards experience, and is thin on theme. But it has to be appreciated for its seminal influence on so many of our reent faves like Puerto Rico, Phoenicia, RftG, and (blatantly) Power Grid.

[3 plays] I love Scepter of Zavandor, but you know what it just hasn't got?  Robots, that's what.  
Outpost is an older game that was the basis for a re-theming into SoZ, so I kind of expected it to be SoZ with a sci-fi theme, but actually they are a lot more different than I had anticipated.  Both good, though.

RATING: 2
What a ridiculous game. I'll put aside the economic snowballing for a second and harp on the way the endgame degrades into agonizingly long turns as players try to use their hand of card denominations in the most efficient ways since change isn't given. How best to spend 13-17-7-11-9-44-10-13-11-12-13? How much can I bid in this auction without grossly overspending then? The entire experience sputters and stalls as players work out optimum configurations for optimum bids.

The economic snowballing is only mildly interesting relative to Scepter of Zavandor (the superior game IMO) since you don't have the tech track decision each turn like you do in Scepter. Once a player falls behind, it's over; they may as well resign and go do something else while the two leaders finish up with the math exam.

I realize there's a hardcore fan base here, so it seems that if you're interested in this type of accounting efficiency exercise, you'll be at home here, otherwise avoid with extreme prejudice.

An interesting game, and unfortunately out of my price range (by about $200 or so). Not a favourite game, but good for a play every now and again. And if the urge ever hit right, I'd consider making a copy. The Scepter of Zavandor hit's the spot as Outpost's replacement, and despite the fact that I was leery of the fantasy theme (and I love fantasy) it works well and is enjoyable.

EDIT FOR NEW EDITION: Not sure how much the runaway-leader has been resolved. It's still fun though.

I purchased the game online because I liked the looks of it, number of players, time involved, etc.  I was shocked when it arrived because on the side of the box it said, " 20th Anniversary Deluxe Edition"!  Obviously this is a game that has been around a long time, and certainly popular enough to celebrate with a special release.  How could I not have heard of it?  I have been board game hungry all my life and although there were no board game stores in my part of the state, I always found these stores when we traveled.  Not only that, my fellow enthusiastic gamers had never heard of it either, yet going online today I see some describe this as a classic.  Interesting.

We all four liked the game and want to play it again.  The rules are easy and play is straight forward.  

There does not seem to be a catch-up mechanism, so those who get off to a bad start will often stay behind.  A few rounds into the game and the starting order based on who was in the lead, never changed.  There is an expansion included which we have not yet played, which hopefully corrects this.  

Time spent doing math is an issue.  Not difficult, just easy to get confused with various discounts, and have to start over.  

Lastly the score markers used on the players' boards are very small--hopefully they won't get lost.

I seem to recall it is something like The Scepter of Zavandor, which I want to play again for comparison, and  I have not yet played Phoenicia, which I own, and which I am told is also similar to Outpost. For a 20 year old game, Outpost has a lot going for it, and to me does not seem outdated.  

EDIT: 6 people made a long, long game...which we all loved, but 9 people?  Wow.

Fairly tedious game which functions as almost perpetual solitaire with the basic rules.

I'm going to rate this the same as Scepter of Zavandor--both games were a near miss for me. I seem to remember Scepter having a little more strategic depth but a much longer play time. The runaway leader issue seems more pronounced here, which can't be a good thing. I want to like these games more than I do, but they require an investment of time and effort far beyond what seems reasonable for the fun they provide. Willing to play again in the right mood but wouldn't suggest it.

RATING: 7.75
After a few plays of Phoenicia, and also having tried Scepter of Zavandor, and having read many comments, I was prepared to be slightly disappointed in this game; the granddaddy of the auction-driven games with the Hlvaty machanics. (Mind you, the artwork and game design is awesome, and bears out the excellence I now expect from Stronghold games.)

I was pleasantly surprised- I found it to play very naturally, to move smoothly through the phases, to offer many challenging choices each round, and to reward those who have the right money at the right time for the key auction.

It played almost a quickly through my 2-player solo game as Phoenicia, looked nicer and had an excellent theme/structure, and it seemed more intuitive and moved faster than Scepter to me, on a 1st play.

I'll rate this a conservative 7.5, expecting it to go higher.  I have to agree with those who said the other games weren't Outpost; this is a classic game, and I expect to play it more very soon.

4-Player game had a slightly different arc- more of a definite leader, thought this swung a couple of times. This stretches out a little with additional players.

Tried solo 2-Player game a 2nd time, using Kicker and making certain (2) x Scientists + (2) x Laboratories available- what a race to the finish!  A dead heat at 87 points apiece, and a ¢10 difference in total overall spend- what a razor dividing line it was, with even cash credits in-hand very similar.

This definitely gets a boost as it gets it's 'nickel' play- 7.75.

(08/05/2012) Comment based on one play.

When I read that this was the original game from where Scepter of Zandor and Phoenicia are derived, I shuddered, as I had a terrible experience with Phoenicia.

The sci-fi theme of mining and developing outposts in space was quite appealing.

This turns out to be one of those economic efficiency games, along the lines of [thing=3828]Lokomotive Werks[/thing]. In Lokomotive Werks, demand flucuates randomly and supply is dictated by how many factories are manned with workers. In Outpost, manned mines will always produce a fixed number of income cards, but the value of each income card will be random. Cash is used to buy more factories and workers, in order to generate even more income, constrained by hand limit size and worker limit. However, in Outpost there is a random selection of technology items that can be auctioned and purchased, in order to enable building more sophisticated mines/laboratories/ships (that produce progressively higher income values), increase in hand limit, increase in worker limit (number of colonists), or other special capabilities.

Most purchased items have VP values, and upon one player reaching some threshold VP, triggers a new "era" which releases newer, more sophisticated (and more expensive) technologies. It is a VP race, instead of a cash value race in Lokomotive Werks.

Like Lokomotive Werks, there are also several bottlenecks in the game design that force players to chose one of several paths to producing more income. However, with the random appearance of certain types of technologies, there is plenty of variability from game to game, which keeps it interesting.

Unfortunately, this is a very arithmetic-intensive game, with lots of addition. Similar to Knizia's [thing=220]High Society[/thing], no change is given for purchases, thus a player may need to overpay because they do not have exact change due to the somewhat erratic value of each card. This makes for an interesting optimization, trying to pay for something, without overspending. Calculators are pretty much required at later stages of the game.

Overall, the reprint has good components, although the player tableaus could use additional helpful information. Play is relatively quick, as there is only income production, auctioning of tech cards, buying infrastructure, and then determining turn order for next turn. Rinse and repeat until someone reaches 75 VP. The theme may be a bit dry to some, and mechanically, it may be repetitive, but there are some interesting tactical and strategic choices to be made each turn, all with long-term implications. I look forward to playing this again, and rate it a solid '8'.

Update (05/20/12) 2 plays: Tried this again with four players, taking two+ hours. If the right combos of technology cards are bid and won by one player, the game devolves into an economic snowball. I don't think there are any catch up mechanisms, once the knee-in-the-curve is hit. I'll have to keep on an eye on this one. Still an '8' for now.

Update (11/24/13) 3 plays: Yes, it is an economic snowball, and somewhat annoying one at that. But, the winning player won with labs, and squeaked out the supposed leading player who was cranking out titanium mines, because they had several outposts. I will check out the "fix" on BGG that deals with the runaway leader issues. I'm dropping it to a "7" for now.

Now that I've played this, it's pretty easy to see why people have tried to make more streamlined versions of it (Scepter of Zavandor, Phoenicia).  It's a pure economic engine game in which players build up to more efficient types of money; various factories allow them to draw money cards from different stacks. It has a fun theme, it's exciting, and it makes no apology for the rich-get-richer nature of it--so it can't exactly be called balanced. More importantly, it involves lots and lots of adding numbers together in different combinations to find the best way to pay for something or the most appropriate amount to bid. I think a computer would really help. But it's still a neat system.  It's increased my appreciation for Scepter, which I'd like to play again. (1 play)

Cool auction game with a great theme and artwork (especially in the current edition).

An interesting auction game that slows down due to the constant adding of each players bid cards. This happens because players cannot receive change and they have a hand limit. Also the cards come in odd denominations so the game continually stops as each player counts up their cards in different ways to determine how much their next bid should be. Without all of the math the game would be fairly quick but our last game clocked in around 4 hours with five players and no calculators.

There's a reason why Scepter of Zavandor and Phoenicia exist. It's the reason why I would prefer anyone of them anytime over the original Outpost. Outpost is the most ruthless, relentless economic snowball game ever developed. It lasts two to three hours and after the first few moves you can make an educated guess on the player order at game end. Most of the time there will be a player or two who will have to endure another couple of hours knowing there's nothing they can do to win. Annoyingly, it doesn't have to be a fault on their own that got them stuck in this position. It doesn't help that the BGG forum is full of strategy posts by experienced players exactly detailing out the most promising initial moves and norm strategies.
Not that there's nothing of interest here. The auctions are where the beef is and need skill. Even with the best start players can still mess up their position by failing bids. Fine-tuning of strategic development along the tech tree is rewarding enough if you're still in the game. 
The successors took up on the good core and alleviated the snowball effect. Phoenicia also curbed the game length to a more reasonable amount for an engine-building game. While I can understand where the fascination for Outpost on its release came from it nowadays is obsolete. Too many better games crying for play time.

Back in the early 90's I played this game several times.  It is a good economic game, with an interesting technology tree to explore.  I appreciated the science fiction theme.  The game was enjoyed many times - we wore a game out.  So we definitely got our money's worth out of it.

Eventually it was set aside.  But then, along cam Zepter von Zavandor.  Voila the game was back - now as a fantasy theme, but still very much recognizable.  However the revision did attempt to rein in the leader more.  Playing Zepter was fun, as it was still the same game (mostly) but had much nicer componentry.

But wait!  Yest another iteration of the system, Phoenicia was released.  I think we actually played this more than Zepter.  This third version was heavily abridged.

So now, I have the 2nd edition of Outpost.  I haven't played the 2nd edition yet, but I am looking forward to trying it out.  Ultimately I didn't keep Zepter or Phoenicia.  So I am curious to see if a second visitation to the original Outpost, now 20 some years later will hold up for me.  I have borrowed that old 1st edition from a friend's collection, and will enjoy comparing and contrasting the different editions.

outpost is a classic. there is no extra catch up mechanism allthough turnorder could help you to make the right choices.
there is luck, but most of the time the player who planned best ahead will take the win.
there is a lot of counting. so much so that you would think that people wouldnt care but  somehow you really dont mind.

what wasnt stresseed enough is that creating income is key to the game. if you can create the most income during the game you will probably win.

i adviced my opponents in my second game to focus on income. they both got three technologies from the first era and lost the game. i won without uranium but i build ten water factories which to my surprise did help me a lot.

outpost, robotics , the final three technologies and offcourse laboratory are key technologies. 

the changing hand limit is a thing of beauty.

I have two problems with this game.  (A) has a severe runaway leader(s) problem where you cannot really come from behind, so you cannot realistically bounce back from early bad luck unless leader(s) falter, and (B) beginners will not likely understand fully all the various types of factories & improvements. Also, this is somewhat of a long game.

RATING: 5
Playing this, it suddenly became clear where the designers of all those optimization race games (Puerto Rico, Princes of Florence, Dominion, et al) took their inspiration.  It's not clear to me why they those designers all took the basic Outpost formula and made lower-conflict, more milquetoast successors.

Outpost is the ur-model for these games, where you compete with opponents for goods to build an engine to generate money to buy more goods and eventually generate the most VPs.  It's better than the games that came afterward because in Outpost, these goods are coming up for constant auction so you can bid up what your opponents are trying to get.

Having said all that, Outpost is still not really to my gaming preferences.  It is a well-built entry of a genre that I do not particularly enjoy.  Still, well-built.

We played by the "updated" rules that adjust some card costs and abilities.  I cannot comment on the original rules.

After years of looking and waiting, finally have a copy.  Very direct, simple economic pyramid game.  Plays more quickly than I expected, although there are lots and lots of continual calculations, so don't play too tired.  Don't like the box art and the box too large, but the contents are functional and actually look pretty good.  Glad to have the opportunity to get this game because the resale market was getting silly.  

Played again and did better than before, but not a win yet.  Fall behind and you have a very difficult, if not impossible, chance to catch up.  Can make for a long game.

The format of the game here is fine, and I enjoy the pseudo tech tree. Unfortunately there are two problems with it. First, the card-based economy leads to repetitive counting and re-counting plus occasional spend optimization which is fiddly and boring. Second, the winner is clear about 2/3 the way through the game, if not earlier, but players must wait for the snowball to crash to end.

This is my comfort food game. 

Economic snowball game with notoriously chunky money. 

On your turn you can put something up for auction to improve income or capabilities; you can also buy stuff from the bank to improve income. 

As the game progresses the tiny pool of things up for auction each turn gets drawn from nicer and shinier stuff. 

VP are simply the sum of the VP on your auction purchases and staffed income generators. 

(2009?)
Yet another economic snowball auction game.  Rating based on Andy's house rules, which somewhat reduce the effects of early luck. 

Rule 1: Two resource draws on the first turn. 
Rule 2: First robot card allows one robot per real person. 

"It is traditional for all players to complain about sub-average resource draws."

I was astounded when I found out this was over twenty years old. I'm no expert on board game history, but my impression had always been that engine-building games like this were a more recent phenomenon. Perhaps their popularity has been, but Outpost was clearly doing it long before the recent trend.

Once I started playing, I could feel the game's age. The currency cards were ridiculously clunky. Were this game created today, we probably would have been converting little brown cubes into blue into gray and so on; still not my favorite, but more elegant by far. The game is also too long for what it is. It demands the same thing from you as Caylus, Homesteaders, etc., (i.e., figure out the spreadsheet) but is twice as long.

RATING: 5
The rules say that if any player gets a starting hand of less than 20 credits (ie the price of a "Water Factory") then they may still buy a Water Factory in turn 1. This is a huge clue that if you chose not to buy a Water Factory then you are already 95% certain to lose. The upgrades are just there to tease you, you buy and you die. Turn 1 is very unforgiving.

Having no change is ridiculous in an advanced civilization. Adds nothing but inconvenience.

I simply can't explain why all these great civilizations can only produce 5 upgrades per turn between them - why not throw the whole era's upgrades on the market and save the fiddle factor. Well I suppose I know the answer to that already, low replay value.

I can certainly see the appeal in this game, and the luck-skill balance is nicely tuned. The auction and economy elements are sound, and the range of strategies is enough to make Outpost a good once-a-year game, but no more. It's important to have players (not more than 4, ideally) of equal skill to avoid runaway leadership issues, and the amount of dull maths is a real drain on the enjoyability as well.

Pretty straightforward snowball game.  It starts off slowly and if someone can time correctly when to pull the trigger and race ahead of everyone, it's hard to catch up.  If you're not that front runner, you'll need to find a way to have a chance, and that is part of the challenge in this game - it's not designed to help you if you are behind.  Given that, I really enjoyed it and would play it again since it's not too thinky... well... there is the bit about having to get the right amounts of money with unusual denominations.

*** Rating and comment for new edition ***

Played once and definitely felt the learning curve threatening to flip me over. My feeling at the midway point of the game was that a) I had no chance of winning and that b) Another player was assured of victory.

I was half right, finishing with a score of 49 to the eventual victor's 83, although the winner was the third player, not the guy I had pegged as too far ahead to catch.

That makes me feel a little better about the game, as it initially felt as though an early advantage was insurmountable. Turns out it's not, although the flipside is that letting one player grab all the Labs is probably also a bad idea.

I do maintain that doing anything other than buying a water plan on the first turn is a horrible choice, though. I bought Ice Prospectors and ended up behind on the money curve all game. With more experience perhaps I'd have been able to sacrifice one turn's worth of growth to hopefully leapfrog the turn after, but who knows.

Definitely one to play again and see how much better I can play, although the punishing rich-get-richer syndrome is currently knocking this one down a few notches ratings-wise.

Innovative and impactful for its time, the big momma of engine building games - build factories, get money, buy more factories, get more money, buy factories and VP earning cards that allow you to buy bigger factories ... and on it goes. Its celebration of the rich getting richer is the known big elephant in the room, and it's unapologetic about it. Fortunately Zepter makes the apology and becomes the default game in this genre if I have to choose between them. This version is just too unforgiving for everyone to enjoy it once people lose touch with the peloton, which can happen quite early as well with some poor resource card draws.

I played Outpost "descendants" Phoenicia and Scepter of Zavandor before playing this game, and surprisingly, I found Outpost to be a lot more straightforward.  Unlike the other games, you did not have to have extensive knowledge of the cards that would be available later in the game to be able to plan an effective strategy from the start--most of the later-round cards were more of the same, except bigger.  Where the game became less fun for me was the unreasonable amount of math--later in the game, I was forced to add 10-12 two-digit numbers in different combinations to figure out how much to bid.  I imagine with more players this would lead to lots of downtime.

RATING: 8
I really enjoy this game. It is a bit mathy but that doesn't bother me.
I love the exponential pace of the game. After my first play, coming in second, it definitely hurt my brain to think about what I could have done better. As with all auction games all players need to understand relative value and it can be annoying if there are only 2 players with money to bid with one not grasping the importance of driving up the bid of an item that is critical to another players success. To that point this game needs a good player aid/player board for first time players. One that provides transparency on all the available technologies so player can easier plan ahead knowing exactly when specific upgrades are first and last available.

[b]Edit:[/b] As an update, as I have now played the game 3 more times. This game truly shines after multiple play, especially with a group that is gaining experience with the tech tree. With an experienced group of gamers, I have seen no sign of a run away leader. The last 5 player game ended with a final score variance from first to last place of only 14 points. An amazing game experience. This has become one of my favorite game.

Having now played with the Kicker Expansion, I could not imagine playing the game any other way. A really great bonus expansion by Stronghold Games.

RATING: 5
This auction and economic game has a lot of things to answer for, but easily the most pronounced is making an auction game where all your money denominations were in fixed values and you couldn't get change. Every time the bid comes back around to you again you have to go through all the permutations of how to divide you money up so you can bid accurately, and once it's raised by even a single dollar, you have to do all the calculations from scratch. Pure idiocy in design, to be honest, and it hamstrings anything else the game was trying to do.

At first blush, this game would appear to be right up my alley: auctions, economics, and engine-building are among my favorite game mechanisms. But Outpost totally fell flat with me. It's too bad, because one of the groups I play with is in love with this game. 

One thing that bothered me about the game was the downtime. The auctions can be interminable due to the nature of the currency. Each player can have some number of factories and each of the factories allows that player to draw a card of the appropriate resource every turn. There is variation in the values of these reseources (e.g., water is something like 5-10), and after using the resource cards to purchase something in the auction, no change is available. The result is that very often a player has to sum the cards in his hand to determine which discrete values are best for bidding. This can make an auction painfully slow. And each round of the game can include quite a number of auctions!

Furthermore, the game seems to have no way to slow down the leader. When a person gets some powerful factories early on, she will be producing more income each turn. But as far as I can tell, there is no drawback to being early. In my one play, we could tell which two players would have a chance to win for several turns. The rest of us played for 3rd. In some games, I don't mind the lack of a catch-up mechanic, but in an economic game with player interaction limited to auctions there should be something to bring balance to the players. Otherwise, the early luck of getting better resource draws has a disproportionate effect on the outcome. 

I can see why some people really like the game, but it's not for me.

An excellent game, only played it with the Expert rules.

The first edition actually plays 2 to 10 players for the advanced and expert games, but says 3 to 8 players on the box.

Now played the new (2011) edition with 3 players.  Appears to be the same as the original game's expert rules, but better game components (except it is missing a game board).

Quite a lot of adding up, particularly in the later game when you are getting a lot of production cards.

Now also played with the new edition's optional extra 9 cards, which adds an interesting extra dimension to play.

Reminded me vaguely of Puerto Rico or Princes of Florence. The first half was good fun. The auctions worked, building your outpost was challenging and I like the "no change" rule. But it went totally mental once you were receiving 180 credits and trying to count twelve cards to work out your auction bids. I needed an accountant next to me. One of the other plays said it best - would work better as a computer game. Can see why it has cult status, however. Would reward repeat playing - but it won't get it from me.

Great auction game. I love how it supports up to 9 players without taking a whole lot of extra time. It can start off a little slow, with each player building up the basics for a few rounds, but once a player hits 10 VP the whole things starts snowballing towards the finish line. From appearances, I thought Outpost would be a little dry, but I can honestly say I haven't had a dull moment yet.

--Jun2012-- I've now a half-dozen plays on my copy:  it's one I'm very happy to own and play - and (fortunately for me) son #2 is enjoying it and improving in his play.

I really enjoy this, despite my inability to do the maths at times!  Somehow I always end up in the titanium strategy in my play group.

Just got the new edition and like most of it, but do wish they'd made the cards easier to differentiate across the table.  Not too sure about the kicker expansion either - I think it's a better game without it.

RATING: 5
I suppose it is worth considering owing to the range of player numbers it supports, but I didn't enjoy this at all. Phoenicia is better balanced, if ultimately no less forgiving. Luck of the draw in the first half dozen rounds is crucial, and the range of values on resource cars can lead to brutal differences in players' buying power. Waiting for people to count their card values or decide if they even want to bid in the auctions is tedious. Probably tolerable if players are all concentrating on what they are doing and have played it before. And does it always take forever? I thought I liked auction/economic games before playing this museum piece.

We played with six different people.
Everybody seemed to enjoy it while playing.

It's easy to explain, everybody had fun trying different strategies and bidding went wild sometimes.

The rule of 30 min per person seems spot on!

Will probably try to play it with less players.

Not a bad game, but has some issues with runaway leaders as the rich tend to get richer. Luckily there is more than one strategy, but if you're not one of the early leaders its very hard (not impossible) to come from behind with one of the alternate strategies. I might play once a year or so.

RATING: 5
This is a bidding game where there is always 1 less of each item than the number of players.  Important to save up money so that you can outbid others on the important items (if they come up for sale on the die rolls).  Bring a calculator as adding up all the cards can be a pain.  

Back in 1991 this was a decent game as it was fairly short and the only other options were 5+ hour Avalon Hill games.  Now there are 100+ games which fit that bill and are better than Outpost.  Worth playing on occasion perhaps, but there are much better options.

RATING: 7.7
It's the only game I've seen so far that reasonably plays up to 9 people; and I don't even know many games that play up to 9 people at all.

It is a fairly obvious ancestor of Scepter of Zavandor. Obvious in two ways: Zavandor has many of the same mechanisms, and Zavandor is much much better balanced. The available upgrade card selection in Outpost is stupid to say the least, the income scheme has unadulterated exponential growth, and the number of different income cards is sheer madness. In short: Zavandor is the much much better version of two very similar games, and if you have to choose between Outpost and Zavandor, there is not a single reason not to prefer Zavandor.

But that being said, even a weak version of Zavandor is a great game, and if you ever want to play with 7 to 9 people, Outpost is awesome.

I like this game because everybody starts pretty much even. There's no dice and auctions are like real auctions, not like in Ra where you can only bid 1 of 3 diff values.

I just like pretty much everything about this game. Very enjoyable and challenging.

Turning a blind eye on the bad components and art (it is 20 years old after all), there are some solid gameplay here.  The problem is the game gets too clunky and too bloated by the end.  I don't want to add cards into the hundreds every turn!  I'll stick with more recent auction games, or get a robot to play for me.

I bought this on a whim a couple of years after it came out, and I the first play left me distinctly nonplussed.  I pulled it out again recently, and was again less than blown away by the experience.  There are some good ideas here, but it can get very processional, and good luck pegging back an early leader.

Wow! This just drags on and on, and really is an exercise in trying to figure out how to be more effective in rounding your cards to even increments. There definitely is a snowball leader effect that happens in the latter portion of the game (around phase 3), and there are many much better auction games out there.

2 2-player games, Stronghold version

A very fun economic, auction game where you're buying factories that produce money each turn, but in a semi-random way: each operational factory will give you a card, but the values in the deck vary (widely?). You are able to build better factories (higher-average payout cards) by acquiring the appropriate tech -- via auctions. The cards available for auction, however, come up in variable order (3 eras, triggered by players reaching certain VP thresholds; new cards possible each era, specific cards available determined by die rolls) and there will not be enough of each type for everybody: you will be forced to find your own path! 

The worst part of the game is the math. It's not complicated, it's just cumbersome! During the auctions, you don't get any change back; so if you want to optimize your reward-to-payment ratio, you must bid such that you pay exactly the value of some subset of your cards. As the number of cards in your hand increases, it becomes more and more painful figuring out these exact values! Still, it's a very fun game!

Simple but vicious economic snowball that I will strongly resist playing because the auctions -- people trying to come up with the lowest possible high bid within the constraints of their cards -- are exercises in extreme tedium. With computer assistance they would be a thousand times faster: Outpost is a game I would gladly play on my phone.

I'll look into its various descendents (Phoenicia etc.) to see if there's one that streamlines away the pain, because there's a good game there. It's just not worth the effort.

I hear all these complaint about this game, but I don't care, nor do I believe them.  I've seen a plethora of combinations of cards used to win.  There are many viable strategies.  The key to the game is controlling when the game "breaks open" and knowing when to save your money.

Solid multi-player game, and normally the auction mechanic is my least favorite of all. New edition is a significant imrovement with excellent components.

Economic snowballs in space. Long but engaging. I can't explain why but I rather enjoyed this, while ZvZ left me unmoved and Phoenicia left me cold. I've only played an artscow version with added cubes, so I can't comment on the original components.

Now also played the Stronghold Games edition, and this solidified my initial long / engaging / enjoyable feelings.

If you like your game to be on an epic feel than this is one for you.
Auction for items to make your outpost productive. 
The items become very expensive makng it a challenge as to whether you spend or save without feeling that you are falling behind the opposition.
Great pieces and fitting analogy for the theme

Great game, sadly OOP.  While I disagree that it has a runaway leader problem (assuming people know what they are doing), I do agree that even amongst experienced players the vagries of what comes up and what strategies people choose usually leads to at least one person being out of the game by midgame.  However, I think that's true of almost any game with luck elements.

Outpost represents an evolutionary step in the modern gaming industry.  It's a hybrid of runaway-leader Ameritrash and polished Euro engine-building.  The result is satisfying, if longish, and Outpost is a rare choice that scales well with large groups. The rough edges are all there, mind you, and the original bits are hugely primitive by today's standards.  They prove the longevitiy and charm of the game itself.

This is a race game to the finish. You never know if you paid too much for a technology card until you win (or loose) the game. It is a game with simple rules that you need to play once to figure our prerequisites for the different factories. It takes about 2-3 hours for 4 players. You better have some calculators handy to speed up the game!!! Have fun!

I don't mind the length, and I like the system mostly.  I'm very bad at auction games-- I generally get outbid and lose every auction, which means I don't get that doodad, and now someone else has that doodad, so they have more money and can outbid on the next auction-- that's a player fault, not the game's fault.  But I'm also very bad at addition, and adding (and re-adding) the numbers on the cards slows it down and makes it difficult to keep track of how much money I have, especially towards the end of the game.  Which, again, might be my fault more than the game's.

One play (Stronghold edition). Greatly prefer the theme to that of Das Zepter von Zavandor, and happy that the end cards are straight VPs rather than rewards for particular strategies, though I do miss the asymmetric starting positions and the Dust.  I'm well aware of the component improvement over the TimJim original, but as I never played that version and I wouldn't have minded a physical design that did away with the piles of little chits.

Not a game I have much desire to play again. The theme is very lacking. The math during bidding is a pain in the a$$. Once someone gets a lead it becomes harder and harder to stop him and if you are behind it is almost impossible to catch up as the strong jusT keep getting stronger. A game of solitaire with a bidding component. Not a lot of fun IMO.

This is one of those strange cases where I truly enjoy a game but I can't give it a blanket recommendation because of a few quirks that can justifiably rub folks the wrong way. There is a lot of accounting. Not planning type accounting, nor "counting the spoils" type of upkeep accounting, but rather recounting the same numbers in different combinations over and over again with every action you take. To me, that's where the game lies, so I liked it, but others I have played with find it a bit tedious. (It has a Knizia style auction system where your currency cards are somewhat random denominations, but you aren't allowed to make change...meaning you are always recalculating your optimum bid to limit waste.)

It's also very punishing, in that if you make a bad decision, or sometimes just flat out get beaten in the race to a technology by another player, your game may be functionally over. For all of you Splotter-style gamers out there, this is probably a non-issue and will likely, in fact, be viewed as a feature. So while there are vast swaths of people I would tell to stay away from this game, it is still the best "boom or bust" mining game I've played and it's absolutely stellar when put into the context of how old it is, predating all of Reiner Knizia's famous auction games.

A technology tree game where the technology cards are auctioned. Once you're behind there is no way to catch up. Getting behind is caused either because of an early game mistake or more lickely because you drew low money cards. I understand this might have been a great game 1991 but it hasn't aged pretty well. Not worth the money to play or buy it today (2012).

Very high runnaway leader problem with original rules. Better with some house rules, but i stopped playing when the 3rd edition of house rules were introduced (they are currently at 4th edition at our gaming club). 

To long. Very bad production quality.

Better play Zepter of Zavandor instead.

RATING: N/A
Build space outposts. Engine building, auction card game that escalates. Auction to buy tech upgrades and resources, generate money, build factories, place worker/robot tiles, score points, repeat. Better to have mega water than individual water cards. Player boards for colony size, factory output. The trick is no change when bidding or buying. So you have to manage your credit denominations while other players try to bid you into a bind. Dry and mathy. Up to 9 players.

A heavy game that scales well from 2-9? Unsuprisingly this scales best in the middle ranges... but still works with more or less.  The resource management of the auctions and the managing of where to put your workers in your outpost provide some nice decision points in the mid game. However the first few rounds don't have much happening while everyone waits to generate enough resources to do something interesting while the last few rounds bog down with way too much simple math as you try to figure out how best to bid with your umpteen cards.  This was never going to be the first auction game I reached for (or even the third) so I traded it.

Originally I was not a big fan of Outpost, but it has increasingly grown on me to the point that I bought my own copy.  I will mention that the "kicker" expansion in the newest version is sort of a mixed bag.

very good dungeon game.
just  one drawback you need one player to be the dungeon master to play the game.
best played with 5 players i think.

Great game, takes me back to the days of Hero Quest although not quite as good. The models are average and the rules could do with being more clear. All in all though it's a fun game, with some quests lasting quite a while. One of the best £3.50 I have ever spent.

Really enjoyed DMing this, though the lack of gold (WHAT ON EARTH WERE THE DESIGNERS THINKING!?) was a bit puzzling.  I'm always on the look out for sources of miniatures, and this one has a half decent game along with it.

First time on the table.  I like it!  It's a very simple dungeon crawl with reasonably good figures and rules.  I DM'd and came pretty close to victory, killing 2 chars (who were later revived) and almost attritting a few more.  Better luck to me next time.  It's no Descent, but certainly worth playing.  Needs wandering monsters.

I enjoyed this. It plays very quickly (we finished the first quest in an hour).
I like it better than Return of the Heroes (mainly due to the incomprehensible rules) and Runebound (ugh, don't like that). Descent is, however, a much better game.

Played this several times with my kids (ages 7 and 8). Perfect for them, way enjoyable for me. This is not D&D, but reminds me more of the DOOM BG or Descent, just easier and faster to play. Early scenarios are fluffy, the later scenarios have more meat. Easily adaptable to solo play.

This game isn't horrible.  I actually reminds me of a simpler Descent 2nd edition.  What the game suffers from is, "why play this, when you can play that" more than anything.  A solo mode would have been smart.

RATING: 6
It's not that bad for a game in this genre. I mean, I love the IDEA of a dungeon-crawler, but it's difficult to get a really good game. D&D does a good job. But different scenatios NEED be created with a better balance of monsters. And I don't like the spells that much.

Played twice, and it has so far provided really enjoyable experiences. I played with my wife and two kids, six and seven, who loved it. The kids needed help to read the cards, and sometimes needed to be reminded of a rule, but on the whole they understood what they had to do.

I can see why the game gets somewhat mixed reviews. Players who want the depth and complexity of a role playing game will be turned off, and will rank the game accordingly. For me, however, the simplicity is one of its great attractions. The rule book is thin, makes sense, and you can start playing straight away. Initiative (handled through a simple but quite clever card system), and fighting is managed easily, quickly, without fuss. The combat system, magic, characters' attributes, treasure/items/spells all feel in-theme, and work easily together.

The beauty for me is that all that's usually difficult and time consuming and fiddly with the complex dungeon crawlers and role playing games has been stripped out to leave you to focus on actually playing and enjoying the game. But don't be fooled, the game provides plenty of scope and situations that reward good tactical play, for both dungeon master (DM) and heroes.

I agree with the reivewer who described the game as one that's light that can be easily modded. In fact, I've already sketched out a new seven-adventure campaign, introducing a medallion trinket I got from a Christmas cracker!

There is a need for a DM, which I have no problem with, but I disagree with the reviewer who said the game's weakness is that the DM must be an opponent of the heroes. Sure, that's how the rules state it, but in my first two games I walked the path between DM out to win, and DM out to give the heroes a jolly good game. And it was fun for me too when my kids just made it through an adventure, which wasn't a foregone conlcusion. I really like the ease with which you can embellish the adventure with your own details, or mod it as you see fit. We played without one of the heroes (Jozan) and so the first two adventures were tougher than they should have been, but it was balanced and interesting.

I like the components. The figures are quite nice, but a bit chunky perhaps for my taste. I guess they're targeted more for the younger audience. I love the look and simplicity of the dice: they are an absolute joy to look at and use! The boards, as others have reported, are good quality, and with five double-sided boards with doors to place where you will, there is a lot of scope for replayability. The worst aspect of the components has to be the cards, which I find of quite poor quality. I've sleeved them with standard Mayday sleeves straight away (56x87mm - which are an excellent fit). However, the designs on the cards are excellent, and it is easy to read about the object, and how it can be used.

I picked up the game recently off ebay for £30 in an 'as new' state, and the two expansions from BGG also in great condition. So, there are still good copies to be had.

Got a pristine copy on eBay with cards unpunched and bagged minis. Fun, light dungeon crawl with really nice components. Lighter than other DnD board games like Drizzt, and quicker, so I can see this getting a fair bit of play. 8 year old son really loved the first session.

Update: Both kids (6&9) enjoy this now. It's quick to set up and easy to follow. Could be a bit repetitive, but if you DM it in the style of a proper RPG it's a lot of fun.

EMOTICON REVIEW: :)

Light rules dungeon crawler.I am thinking to use this as an introduction to D&D.I have played it before and didn't like it much but I 'll give it a second chance with my new group.

29,Oct.08

We played the first scenario and it was a breeze.The girls (3) learned the rules in 10 minutes and the game went on with out any problems.It was great fun. Hopefully they will get curious about D&D ed.4 (hehehe)

03,Nov.08

Played the 3rd scenario.

09,Nov.08

Done with the 4th. The girls are playing more strategically
and they are excited that they are 2nd level now!

25,Dec.08
2nd level and 5th scenario.

28,Dec.08
6th scenario.The girls are getting quite good.

RATING: 8
Although it plays almost the same as what D&D 4th edition would become a few years later, I found D&D Fantasy Adventure a very enjoyable - however simple - boardgame: in fact both are roll-plays in place of role-plays and focus entirely on combat but at least the latter doesn’t pretend to be an RPG as the latest D&D edition does.

This way even the most unlikely features of this boardgame - such as the rogue’s «disable three traps, cure two wounds» ability - play a bit bizarre but don’t feel as annoying as the 4th edition gamist powers do: even better, as incredibly as it may sound this way they help found D&D Fantasy Adventure get even more fun whilst keeping everything simple, which is always a plus in my book.

It's a fun little dungeon crawler with easy rules and a simple gameplay. As a former DnD player I had to play that but after like 5 games or so it now rests well in the bottom shelf, like other games that lost against time and newer ones, and gathers the dust it deserves.

Manufactured for the UK only, this was my personal Holy Grail for a long time - which I now own.  Sort of like an old school, Hero Quest inspired version of 3rd edition D&D.  Great pieces and the amount of stuff in the game is awesome.

If you can't get HeroQuest - grab this one! It's basically the same gameplay, only in the D&D universe, with some modifications, modular maps, and more variety. The minis are cool, the missions as well, only the flimsy cards should be sleeved and treated well, unless you want dents and creases. Other than that it's fun to play - a good oldschool dungeon crawler!

To be honest, as ridiculous as the dice are in this game, it's still one of the better 'dungeon style' games out there IF you have someone willing to play the DM who does not mind losing--the DM gets rolled almost every time.
Pros:
-Simple gameplay, and relatively quick play time.
-It has a classic feel to it. Open a door and there are traditional  monsters traps and treasures... LOTS of them.
-It doesn't feel mechanical. You have the choice to play cautiously or wrecklessly and it affects the outcome roughly as you would expect. 
-Very easy to make your own adventures and adapt storylines for replayability.
Cons:
-There are so many dice!!! Very luck-based, and your chance of turning undead or finding a trap is completely dice-based, so it does not increase with your level.
-The initiative system is a bit wacky, but at least you're not rolling even more dice.
-Most of the base game monsters are a little boring, being not much more than meat sacks with no special abilities. 
Conclusion: Can be extremely fun. You have to be in the mood for it though because it can grind at times.

This just might be the fantasy dungeoncrawler I have been searching for.  Descent is far too long for the fun it provides and Castle Ravenloft was far too simple and repetitive.  The component quality is pretty decent and the inter-linking scenarios form one big campaign.  Replayability may be and issue and it is very difficult to find in the US (not released here).

Unbelievably I found a copy of this game in a thrift store here in New Jersey. Knowing what is was and that it was never published in the USA. I immediately grabbed it. Even more unbelievable was that it was 100% complete and in like new condition. I've only had 1 play at this thus far, but it was a lot of fun. It's a very easy game to learn/teach and has some really nice components.

I really enjoyed the feel of the game. Almost to the point of liking it the same if not a bit more than Heroquest. Both games are very similar. Though Heroquest does look a lot nicer with all of the furnished rooms. I still need to play this a few more times to see if I really do like it better or not, but both games are surely comparable and fun to play.

I'll update again when I get a few more plays.

Whoo Hoo!  Everything you'ld hope that a DnD board game would be !

This is a GREAT DnD-Lite game! A really really good way to introduce non-RPGer's to DnD. It plays a lot like a computer game (go here, kill things, run over the chest (cherry) and get random treasure). No real rhyme or reason. Well, not much of one. 

But that's good enough that a good DM could then say, what else do you want to try?

Basically a dumbed-down version of D&D. Requiring as it does a gamemaster I'm not sure it has any significant advantage over just playing the RPG; at least in Descent the GM can play for victory thanks to the assymetric game system. Here it is just D&D Junior.

Very similar to Descent but much more accessible with lesser playing time. Unlike Descent, you get to build up your characters. If you play D&D, you basically already know how to play this game. This is the closest to a boardgame being a roleplaying experience although you do not get to create your own character. The characters are the same ones from the 3.5 rulebooks. 

Got rid of this because of Descent.

Like said, D&D -boardgame is not the new Hero Quest, but it does have the same atmosphere and feel of adventure. Works well when played as a campaign (and not too often). You'll soon grow tired of the items and traps though. It really needs those expansions.

I love this game.  The fun of the classic Heroquest, mixed with 3rd edition style D&D.  Would rate it even higher if it could be easily played with just 2 people.  Hard to get a big group together these days.  Works well with 3 (2 players, 1 DM) or 4 (3 players, + 1 DM).  This game NEEDS a stateside release.  Perhaps with the success of Heroscape, more games like this will see the light of day in the U.S.

Might be the closest thing to D&D in a boardgame so far, hopefully someone will top it. 

Edit - hmm many many years later apparently this system is a little too 'basic', a shame and maybe only good for an introduction or very simple gameplay. 

REALLY don't understand people who say it is simpler than HQ though, that game was so simple it hurt, nostalgia holds HQ far too high. This was barely better than HQ, if at all, and like that game good houserules could greatly improve it but why bother when WHQ already does everything better.  

It looks like WHQ is still the best D&D game to date

RATING: 9.5
A very nice game, and probably the best of this kind I have encountered so far, passing games like Hero Quest. It contains most of the things you remember from a Dungeons &amp; Dragons adventure, and its just the kind of game you pull forward when the group is to tired, or to few for a real rpg.
It have a few issues that I felt &quot;strange&quot;, such as the Thief being one of the best meleefighters in the game, the cleric mostly using ranged weapons, and spells very expensive... But besides that, it is worth a spot in every dungeon-fan&#039;s collection.
The game screams for a sequel, hopefully with more monstertypes, more classes and more items.

Wow, after reading the hype on how great this game is for a dungeon crawl, I found a copy, plus expansion ($100), played it and am severely disappointed. I'd rather play Descent or role-play D&D. This game was lacking in almost everything. The GM was unable to do anything unless we triggered a trap or he had monsters on the board. Otherwise, we could spend as much time in each room as we wanted. The only fun this game has provided is that we can use the dungeon tile maps in our regular D&D campaigns.

The Wizards of the Coast D&D clone of HeroQuest. I liked it. A good, solid co-operative bit of dungeon-crawling fun. Not too intense on the reading aspect, for rules and such. Quite easy for the young 'uns to pick up and play. I bought my copy in shrink off of eBay and then managed to source the two expansions as well. They are worth it, I think. This one is likely to stay in my collection for quite some time.

This is a good way to introduce new players to the idea of Dungeons and Dragons without lots of rulebooks, or players who are too old for Mice and Mystics to dungeon crawling board games in general.

An imperfect gem. Rules say not to play with any less than four heroes, but with a full battery of heroes the DM player really doesn't have much of a chance.

Heroes play differently enough to be a different experience for each player, but the items, spells, weapons, and artifacts add a level of customization to allow players some options with their character.  

Has great looking components, mostly the figures and dice.  The 3D pieces (columns and trees) are neat, but not entirely necessary for enjoying the game.

My group loved this, even when I finally got them while playing DM.  They immediately asked if we could set up and try again. That is the marker of a great game to me.

Expectations created by the game might have been expected loooong more. For those who have already played Heroquest you will be faced with a gaming system almost identical (there is a chance to do that is pretty LevelUp more) but is a detail of miniatures is absolutely unparalleled supply. The real flaw is in the manual, which is too general and seems to assume its gameplay mechanics already in use in HeroQuest. Unless he is crazy about this kind of games, not one of those titles that I would advise, unless you want to use it as a "resource"to customize some of your games.

Takes longer than 60 minutes, good for novice players to the D&D lore. 

+ Good graphics on board, although quite simple.
+ Miniatures are very hard, difficult to break, but quite "Warhammerish".
+ OK campaign, nice story.
+ Two sides per board allow a good varience in terrain bulding.

- The strength of the heroes and the items they can take is quite limited, so you have to make your own rules so as to play a larger campaign or a more difficult one.
- Trees and marbles are paper - not nice in my eyes.
- The board is nicely made, but quite simple.

RATING: 3
Year's ago, I've first known of Dungeons&Dragons through cartoon and movies. I was mesmerized by the possibilities and the adventures that I was missing. But, like Jon Snow from ASoIaF, I knew nothing. So when the game caught my eye, my gullible and teen self instantly bought it, thinking I got the real deal.*sigh*

This game is NOT D&D in a box. It a Dungeon, and it's a Crawl. 
I didn´t ever finish any campaign. Because after a while, the game gets really boring and repetitive.
To be fair though, at the time of purchase I had fun with it.

Maybe, this could serve as a gateway game for that genre (though there are way better gateway dungeon crawl games)

So yeah....I don't play the original anymore, but some parts got some use outside the game. I got to proxy some other games with the minis and the boards were nice in certain cases.

In conclusion: if you have kids (or you're a kid yourself) and/or you're the type of group that likes a really lite Dungeon Crawl, then this is for you.

RATING: 6
An easy to learn, lightweight D&D adventure game, which is brilliant for introducing new players into the D&D franchise.

Playing as the DM, I felt that it was a little too easy for the heroes, but I suppose that stops new players from getting frustrated.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 6
This D&D outing is a boiled down dungeon crawler which could be considered too simple for adult gaming, aimed more at younger adults and children.

Its very comparable to Heroquest in that the Heroes spend most of the time dicing monsters and searching for traps, and other then a different (better) dice system and modular (better) board its very similar indeed.

The dungeons are a bit sparse though, and could have done with some cool furniture pieces like in Heroquest.

I like the spell system too, which is larger and more exciting then Heroquest's very limited range of one off spells.

The Dungeon Master seems to have a much harder time in this game too, as weaker monsters have a hard time penetrating the Heroes' base armour value. Having a Cleric handy also vastly weighs the game against the DM, as the Heroes can be kept almost constantly topped off.

I'm told that the levels get much harder though.

Recommended for the light Dungeon Crawler genre.

It's okay, I guess.  Very simple system - don't expect any complexity or learning curve here, but the missions are slightly challenging and the level system seems reasonably balanced.  Very similar to Heroquest.

Got this for like 10 euros in a promotion at a toy shop.  As I also play RPGs, I just couldn't pass this one up, I mean even the plastic figurines and tiles are worth the price...

Contrary to some really weird opinions, this is not the holy grail.  It's Diet HeroQuest wrapped in a D&D logo with randomly abstract levelling, but you get some great bits and pieces.

UPDATE 01/01/14:

We broke this out over the hols at the family’s when we had a little downtime and there were no other board games around.  If time permitted I wouldn't actually mind finishing the campaign, more for closure than anything, but this is not a bad little dungeon crawler.  Very simplistic, it’s sort of aimed at families or kids, much like HeroQuest.  The levelling up is too arbitrary for me (you finish x adventures so you go up a level) and we haven’t yet reached the more complex scenarios, so it’s more of a little goblin basher early on.  Also, again like HeroQuest, it’s really not that much fun for the DM player.  Will probably hang on to this until my son is old enough to play, but at the moment it’s really just extra parts for the D&D Adventure System games like Castle Ravenloft.

I really enjoyed playing this one. Having played D&D RPG for many years, this gave me a taste of that without having to spend time creating a character, buying items, etc. The dice and AC make the combat quick and easy to pick up.

Terribly similar to Hero Quest, but based on the original D&D. Components and theme are very good but not so good like those from Hero Quest; on the other side some game mechanics are a little better in D&D, in my opinion (initiative and combat above all). Finally, a great game and lot of fun! Like his old brother, with a bit of imagination this game may be endless (sometimes I've combined this one with Hero Quest).

A great dungeon crawler: easy rules, simple tactics, teamwork, plenty of nice minis... perfect for kids and adults when you're in the mood for killing some monsters.
Combats can't be easier and cleaner with lots of colored dice and variety of weapons.
The only cons may be that sometimes it takes too long and it is always pretty much the same. So we just play it from time to time and we do really enjoy it.

I honestly don't like this game... I don't hate it, don't love it, I just don't really like it. 
I'll play it every now and again when people are up for it (but most people I know are not). If it hadn't been a gift, I probably wouldn't have the game now.
I preffer proper RP's and this isn't really an RP, though it really tries to be (you might contest that MageKnight or Zombies is not a proper RP either, but somehow they don't pretend to be). I don't know, I'm probably biased by preffering and playing the P&P version of D&D weekly.

A very basic HeroQuest clone. I still prefer HeroQuest over this game though as I was never fond of the D&D world. The miniatures and pieces are much nicer and the variety of items makes looting much more fun. But I found the scenarios included, apart from being not many, rather uninteresting and not maximizing what you could have gotten out of this game system.

Picked up a copy of this on ebay for £7. There is some box damage and two of the hero boards are warped, but otherwise it is a decent copy. Pleased to have this one in the collection of "vintage" games.

Decided after playing the game that it should have an 8 for rating. Not as good as Heroquest but a great dungeon adventure game with lots of possibilities. It definetly needs a better batch of adventure scenarios, linked together with more of a story line. Hasbro did a good job on the rules apperently the same designer as HQ but didn't spend a lot of time on the story line. That is where Heroquest gets its unique magical feel. So if some expansions come out with more heros and monsters hopefully they will work more on the text and subject of the adventure. I might even try and write something up myself one day. A lot of fun to play and its fairly quick accept the combat can get drawn out if the dice rolling doesn't cuase much damage either way. The dice are cool and there are quite a few magic items to choose from and spells and such. The boards are great and this makes for an unstatic map everytime.

I [i]inherited[/i] this game from an old friend of mine, when we parted ways.

The game remained unplayed for a few years, untill I finished painting it. Then I used it as "my-first-dungeon-crawl" for my younger cousins.

And that's exactly what this game is. A well-produced introduction to dungeon crawl/rpg-style games. The Dungeon Master in this game truly is a D&D Dungeon Master. He guides the Heroes throught the story told by the scenario's. He's not trying to win the game. He's trying to provide the heroes with as much of a challenge as possible, while they're trying to win the game. The heroes make their way through dungeons and fortresses, trying to gather the loot and slay the monsters, while working towards their goal (from freeiing a sheriff, to gathering ancient artefacts of great power and defeating an evil Lych in the end).

All this is made possible with great components: Heroic scale, cartoony fantasy miniatures for heroes and monsters; sturdy cardboard tokens for chests and doors; standup tokens for pillars and trees; wound markers; and board tiles... Custom damage dice, and dice for special effects (like detecting traps, or turning undead). This paired with a simple, yet engaging, ruleset makes this an ideal game to play with family, kids or even fantasy enthusiast who aren't necessarily into meatier boardgames. Those looking for a meaty dungeoncrawl, are better of with the more grown-up games like Descent etc.

[b][u]Painted the miniatures?:[/u][/b] Yes, and the game looks way nicer, according to my younger cousins.

Surprisingly good (by which I mean "not awful").  Different enough from D&D proper not to just be D&D-lite, while fast-paced enough not to be plodding.  Dungeon crawlers aren't my thing, but this is oky.

2010: Liking the look of this, will eventually get round to painting the figures, although they are really good as they are. Hope to play it with the kids one day, this looks like it may well be an improvement on Heroquest, let alone its successor. The failure of a US release seems inexplicable, but perhaps that itself paved the way for Ravenloft, so all is good.
2014 Edit after a few plays with the kids (ages 6,4 and 3) - fantastic game for this kind of thing. The complexity level is just right. Still not painted the figures - I am enjoying the glossy, garish colours.

I think this this is a nice introduction to dungeon crawlers, it has very simple rules and the gameplay is really straightforward. The first levels are too easy for the heroes, so the dungeon master needs to have some patience, later levels are much harder for them. Nowadays I'd probably consider something more complex to play, but I still enjoy it if the group are not really gamers or there are kids playing.

The idea of transposing the classic RPG Dungeons & Dragons in a Board Game will turn up their nose at the purists of the genre. But I assure you that this game is truly a little gem that can not miss the collection of fans of this kind of games . Very reminiscent of Heroquest , for those who had the good fortune to play with ! But it differs a lot, because the board is composed of 5 different areas interchangeable with each other and which vary according to the adventure that you are playing. Of course, this leaves  to invent an infinite number , in addition to those already on the manual you just have a little 'fantasy . The characters are well characterized and each with its own particular skills. Consequently, even the monsters are varied and lethal . This time you can also explore areas outside the Dungeon itself, such as forests with lots of trees that affect thrown weapons and the view ! Thumbnails and materials are of high standard . In short, a great game that will surely not disappoint the expectations !

OK, my gaming ratio as a eurosnob tells me I shouldn't like this. In fact, most people I know don't like this. But it's a dungeon crawl! With many different monsters and equipment! I have a soft spot for those games and this is a pretty good implementation. Not very innovative and especially the first half of the pre-generated scenarios are far too easy (without being short), but I simply love to play this. Bits are a bit sub-standard when compared to HeroQuest (which is basically the same game), but that's only of minor concern.
If only I could find some not-to-dorky players who like this as much as I do...

It's basically Heroquest with a bit more challenge and variety. Is that bad? No. But still expect to be slaughtered as DM the first adventures ;)

This will be the next 'game to play' after I have completed Heroquest with my son!

[EDIT SEP 2016] After completing Heroquest, we started this one and while it was enjoyable, it is simply too long for what it offers. Heroquest finishes just as it becomes repetitive, this still goes on a while. So while there's more meat as in Heroquest, that is strangely not a good thing as the mechanics cannot hold it.
We moved on to Descent, which trumps this game in every aspect. 

[OKT 2016] Informed my son about my intention to put this on the trade pile. Surprising enough, he urged me to hold on to DnD Fantasy Boardgame, probably because of the all the reading needed in Descent. Well, as long as the kids enjoy this game, I will hold on to it.
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
RATING: 5
Serviceable entry level for young gamers and those new to more complex boardgames than snakes and ladders eh?

But just not enough for experienced gamers who want more depth and scope.

Can quickly feel like a grind in later adventures.
As GM I was unsure if I was playing to win or playing to extend the heroes game experience... speaking of experience, the XP system is... not a system at all.

As a player I felt limited with the preset characters.
Still decent for younglings and newbies and the minis and components are quite nice, just not enough meat on it's bones for me. You can house rule it up the wazoo I guess but then you may as well play something else.

Closest thing to Heroquest without being Heroquest.  MANY more goodies to find; tons of weapons with cool abilities.  Very slick and fast playing.  Missing one or two things: gold (no buying items between adventures, somewhat made up for by the plethora of cool weapons to find, etc) and experience points (which Heroquest also never had).  Interestingly enough, although experience points are missing, you still gain levels, but a level-up is arbitrarily determined by completing a certain adventure number.  This can be awkward at first, but can be good in that you can jump into any adventure and just assign your hero the default weapon for that adventure's experience level (noted on your character card), and use the treasure deck assigned for that level.  Reserving a numerical rating after I get more games under my belt, but so far, it rates a 9 for me, as fast moving dungeon crawls that lend themselves to expansions (both user made and professionally done) represent my personal favorite type of game. *Update* Played more . . . still rates a 9!

My kids (6 & 4) love this game, in particular finding cool Treasure.

My 4yo son as Regdar grabbed as much treasure as he could and ran away once the final boss monster (a Troll) turned up, much to the chagrin of my 6yo daughter!

I had high hopes for this game, being a major player of Dungeons and Dragons in its pure format, and maybe that was the problem. The board game offers a very diluted version of the full game rather than trying to be anything different from it. I see that it might be a good way to get into the D&D universe and introduce you to the basic ideas of dice based combat but really, I feel that the game is so watered down it even gives a false impression of those elements it's trying to take from the RPG. And where's my d20 Wizards, it's just not D&D without my d20...

Rating based on playing as the dungeon master. It's simply not very much fun. I've played several tactical games like this, and I really had no chance. When the heroes optimize their actions and positions, there's really nothing the dungeon master can to do stop them. MAYBE you're able to ALMOST kill ONE of the characters. If you're lucky with the dice rolls.

This might be better played if you turn off your brains and play this as a mindless thematic romp. But my "well trained in the Way of the Euro"-kids didn't, so I was just spending three hours losing. Don't want to play again.

Many years after its release, I finally played it! And with my 10-year old son as Dungeon Master, I had a pretty good time. My son enjoyed it tremendously, which reminded me of the excitement I felt when I played Hero Quest at his age ( or maybe a bit later). The D&D game isn't very challenging for the heroes during the first two adventures and there are some glaring holes in de rules, but the mechanics at work here are better than those found in Hero Quest, and the amount of miniatures and treasure cards is great. The later scenarios also become a lot tougher btw. Glad to own it.

I believe nowadays that this game is superior to Descent (1st ed) even.Also boast the best spell system i have seen in a board game of this type.

[i]Nostalgia 10/10[/i]

My first modern game. This game is [b]AWESOME[/b] for small kids and middle schoolers. Easy to teach and play. Great artwork, custom dice and the box insert features a pit filled with skeletons! The game came out in 2003 but the minis look [b]very good[/b]. I spent my whole childhood designing adventures and monsters for this game. It has everything you need to spark your imagination and tell great stories with friends or solo. I've never felt restricted by the system, since the DM is encouraged to write and bend the rules at will. It's the best introduction to D&D you'll ever find.

I recently showed the game to my brother and sister (14yo,  9yo) and they can't get enough of it. They don't care about the 'real' D&D, but they love the streamlined nature of [i]D&D: The Fantasy Adventure Board Game[/i].

I bought this on a trip to England. The rules aren't written well. The game isn't as fun, so far, as Warhammer Quest or even maybe Heroquest (but it's been a long time since I played the latter). With that said... the game is pretty simple and my 6-year-old son can play. I take two characters, he takes two, and I'm the Dungeon Master too. So for sure fun to play with kids, but I'd pick Warhammer Quest to play with friends -- plus no GM needed.

Update: My 6-year-old son and I have finished three adventures. I play the DM and two characters and he plays the other two. It's got fighting, so he likes it, there's a story (although not a lot to it) and it's fun.

Muy interesante, para iniciarse pero ojo a los "iniciados" también gustará. Un Descent en versión "light" ó 0,0... Perfecto para jugar con chavales.

Decent really replaced this game for me.

It is really fun experience to have the heroes play together against a common foe. The scenarios are heavily balanced towards the heroes in the first section of the campaign book, so if you intend to play as the Evil Overlord, expect to lose the first couple of rounds and try to take note of how the player play so you can take advantage of their tendencies in missions later down the line.

One sad thing of this game is how traps have been implemented in this game. If you played an scenario multiple times, then you can memorise which places are trapped and which aren't, taking away a bit of the excitement but also offensive pressure from the Evil Overlord.

Components are okey, not spectacular. Miniatures are a bit clunky are sometimes look a bit akward due to that.

Includes Eternal Winter and Forbidden Forest expansions.

The main game and both expansions are complete, save for the expansion boxes. They were flimsy, almost paper like, stock. The miniatures are stored in Plano boxes, which would be included. By storing the miniatures that way, all of the counters, etc., and the game boards fit in the main box. The cards are sleeved and stored in deck boxes, which would be included. All game parts are in excellent, almost like new, condition. The game box isn't perfect, there is some minor shelf ware and a couple dings on the box edges.

The figs are really nice, but the missions are linear - really need to hack this one.

Pretty dull "kick down the door" game. If I'm playing D&D I'd rather roleplay it.

[b]VERY TASTY DUNGEON-DELVING GAME![/b]

Nice gameboards. Funky dice. Lovely cards. Slick and simple rules.

This is better than Heroquest/Advanced Heroquest and their stablemates.

Why?
Because this game captures the feel of a great, simple dungeon-crawl better than all the rest. It will bring back glorious memories of Tunnels & Trolls and early AD&D adventures, before you upgraded your campaigns to more adult scenarios with complicated plots/devices.
I simply don't have the time - or the group - anymore to play those great, great mega-quests. Shame.
Now, though, I can lead a party of adventurers into a cut-down version of my old dungeons. You can just concentrate on having FUN - with no need to look up rules or glance at tables, etc.
The rules are simple for quick set-up and explanation.
This is a very good, simple dungeon-crawler.

The whole system is streamlined and cool - I would be wary of adding huge amounts of house rules though; you may very well dilute the elements that make this game good.
All the players have to do is grab a character board, and then they are ready to slaughter - it's as simple as that, because all the character's details/strengths are already detailed for them.

[i]Things I would change from the Parker set:[/i]
1: The trap cards are slightly boring so I'd make a wider selection.
2: The character boards could also do with some additional variety (I've made up a couple myself).
3: Throw away the clunky figures that come with this and replace with OFFICIAL painted minis!

RATING: 9
Standard game-mastered dungeon crawl game in the style of Hero Quest. Hands down, I just love these kind of games. It's indescribably inspiring to make own scenarios, monsters, traps, and heroes. The game is very simple, sometimes badly balanced and lacks several finesses for the dungeon master, but is very very open for making your own rules and it's not constructed as a competitive, closed system. Thus this high rank despite the flaws. It's inspiring and exciting

RATING: 7.5
Lighter than Heroquest, and more enjoyable because of that. I think the artwork is more fitting too.

The game screams "[b][i]Customise me!!!![/i][/b]". There's nothing wrong with the base set, but with so many opportunities to pimp almost everything, and add whatever suitably themed pieces you can get hold of, the temptation is unbearably hard to resist!

Pretty cool and enjoyable game. They took all the good stuff out of Heroquest and put in some more monsters, characters and items in - how can you go wrong with that..

I wanted this to be the new Hero Quest, but it failed horribly in this expectation. Our group gave it a few tries but quickly reverted to the 1989 classic.

Das selbe Spielprinzip wie bei Doom, nur mit Fantasy Setting. Sehr gelungen! Man kann eine ganze Kampagne durchspielen, die in einzelne Kapitel unterteilt ist.

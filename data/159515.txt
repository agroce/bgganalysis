Complex version of Coup with a main mission and no player elimination.  The problem is that the random information changes too quickly, so even once you know something, by the time it comes to your turn again, what you knew no longer applies.  What's left is calculating odds on gaining intel for challenges vs probability of them having the plot they claim.  Also, why aren't they called "role" cards? Anyway, the theme was cool, but that's about it.

Got my copy of Operation F.A.U.S.T. today, and we took it for a spin tonight. It plays a lot like Coup, but with a little more strategy. Some of the turns felt a little underwhelming with the vanilla rules, but there are some variant versions in the rule book that sound like will make it more exciting.

I enjoyed the theme more than I did the mechanics, even though I am a big fan of bluffing games, the bluffing felt 'tacked on', and due to the larger than normal number of plot cards that could be in play it made bluffing more difficult than it should be. 

The kickstarter mat I got with it is also great, unfortunately my roommate decided to spill whiskey on it and some cards...luckily it didn't ruin the cards or mat.

Now I just need to sprinkle them with some cigarette ashes, gun powder residue, blood, & dirt, and it will have a real authentic WWII smell. :)

Initial Impressions:
---------------------
This game feels way more clunky than Coup. While they tried to bring over the bluffing part of Coup, but I did not feel like it really worked here since it there is more "take that" in this one.  Maybe it's better with more than 4 players, but this felt like just another under developed kickstarter.

Good production on the prototype, and I really like the theme, but the game just doesn't work with the card amounts.  Too many cards, not enough information flowing from/to players.  If the card amounts were down to 2 - 4 each or so, it could be quite interesting.

And it goes on a bit too long.

RATING: 8
Played prototype. 

It was a fine example of a bluffing game with some knowledge but not enough to cause the game to breakdown or become an exercise in card counting. The actions available are all situationally useful with none being overly powerful. The action cards have two abilities, one is very good and the other isn't, until it is.

This is set during the WWII era.  You're dealing art items by stealing and creating false copies.  You want to end up with the most amount of money.  They actions you can do are based on the card you play face down and claim what it is.  If you're not called out on it, you get to do that action.  If called out on it and were lying, the caller gets 1/2 of your loot and you don't do your turn (and discard that card).  If you were right, the caller looses 1/2 their loot and you get to do your turn (but discard your card).

I like the theme, and the idea that you are saving valuable art from the Nazis, and the gameplay is interesting enough.  The option to bluff, or never tell a lie during the whole game is nice (some friends of mine hate when you have to lie in games), and although the "bluffing" tactic doesn't seem to be necessary too often, I can see how you could gain an advantage if you press your luck a few more times than we have in our play throughs.  Good game.

I'm normally not a big fan of large group games (I like 2-4), but this game is great if you have company over and want to play a quick, simple, fun and beautiful game. 

Explaining the game is simple. The rules, cards and reference sheets are simple to understand and quick to teach. The game definitely shines with 5–6 players. The mechanics of this game could have been put on to any theme, but the artwork on each card really sells this game.

It is also a great game to play when you're waiting for some of the group to show up, or if some of your group leaves to pick up lunch, because you'll be finished when they get back.

Operation F.A.U.S.T. plays along the lines of Coup (role cards and challenging) but is beefed up into a longer game with an end game objective; players are trying to acquire 1 million dollars in art cards while having all of their forgeries covered by forged documents.

Players can buy role cards; buy art cards; buy forged documents, and use an ability of one of their cards.  An interesting twist is each role card has two abilities, there is an ability you can play and keep that card or there is a more powerful ability that can be taken by discarding the card at the end of your turn.

As for elimination... There is none, but if you are challenged and do not have the card you lose half of your Intel (game currency) to the player who challenged.  Sometimes it’s good to be almost broke as you have nothing to lose!

I have a few nit-picky issues:

The Allies card is very strong, albeit rare so often you are forced to challenge it but it seems like some card should have the ability to block its ability (choose a forged art card from another player’s hand).

Forged document cards are not bound to a specific art card; this creates an issue that in theory you could try to quickly accrue all the forged document cards and prevent a player from ending the game with the exception of blindly swapping art cards as you cannot end the game with a forgery in your possession that does not have a forged document card.  It also leads to a certain amount of logical thematic disconnect.

Overall I like the game, there's a bit more going on that in Coup and it doesn't lead to as many tense 'clutch' situations but it gives you more options and room to plan a strategy.  A caveat is, ideally you want to play this game with people who have played Coup before but Operation F.A.U.S.T. is very much its own beast; some people will appreciate the longer, more drawn out game and time to formulate a plan while others will not like it as much as it lacks the instant gratification of Coup.

INITIAL IMPRESSION

Played with 4, which I would say is not the best number. I think you really need higher player counts for this game to make the challenge/calling element of this game work.

I think the game adds a lot of extra layers to coup, the no player elimination is nice along with the way the art works. however I think the other extra elements don't add much to the game, many just didn't sit well with my group.

Overall I think a lot of games are jumping on the social deduction style game, which is making it so your game needs to be excellent to surpass the originals, and this one just didn't hit the mark.

Mixed feelings:

Coup plays faster but this has more meat, the theme does not attract others to play with ease though very unique, and I'm not sure if the bluffing / deduction is front and center or more passive. Plus there is the randomness of the paintings that adds a layer of uncertainty to the game. Well designed but not a game I see hitting the table often.

I was pleasantly surprised by Operation F.A.U.S.T. Based on the reviews I was expecting to be disappointed, however, this was a huge hit with my game group. This felt like Coup with a purpose (and for that reason it will replace Coup for me).  Lot of laughs but also some good strategy.

07-28-2015 - Mascaraed, Werewolf, Resistance, all these hidden role games fall flat for me.  They all have elements I like, but ultimately there seems to be something missing from all of them.  Some mechanic that would really tie things together and make the game meaningful and strategic.  Operation F.A.U.S.T isn't a perfect game, but it's as close as I've found yet that really scratches the hidden role itch in all the right ways.  You can bluff about who you are, but being called out on it doesn't, like, put you out of the game.  This won't be a full review here, but suffice it to say I'll be buying this one as soon as I see it available.  Fantastic.  10.

This has somewhat replaced Coup in my local group, just because there's no elimination and it's somehow easier for people to pick up despite actually being more complicated. It's also a Grey Fox game, which means that I basically have to like it. Good thing it's worthy! I love the multi-use of the cards, and being able to pick up extra roles is a really great mechanism.

Played this at gencon, this game fixed a lot of the issues that I have with Coup, specifically - people sniping players out of the game and no "showdowns" at the end of the game where both players know who is going to win. My group sat down to play this game and the card backs and art made me think I wouldn't be interested in this game, but I wound up being very pleasantly surprised. I had a lot of fun and a lot of laughs playing this game, it adds a lot of strategy and layers on top of a coup-like game. The game designer was very fun to play with, disappointed that units of the game were held up at customs because I would have bought it on the spot to support him.

Cute little deduction/bluffing game of WWII; a better version of Coup. The hand/table actions of the characters are balanced, variant and keep the game exciting. And Operation FAUST has fixed most of the problems with Coup: there is an objective behind just lying to your friends about the cards you have. With this game, there is a higher objective. In that respect, you almost don't need to lie about the cards you have, if you're that type of player. I've never played the game with more than three people and I'm anxious to see how they play out. It's a thematic medium game to throw between games.

RATING: 9
At first glance, this bluffing and action-selection card-game may seems like it plays dryly, but I promise that it is very juicy. Another excellent design by Robert Burke. Operation F.A.U.S.T. takes the card game Coup to another level, giving players a goal to be the first to accumulate 1 million dollars worth of art from the Nazis. Brutal social game on a level that suits me best: heavier than Coup; not as intense as The Resistance. The graphics and art really add class.

A surprise hit.

I enjoyed this with 4 to 6 players. 3 works fine, but not as good, IMO. I have not played with 7, or 8 players yet.

Feels like an under developed version of Coup. There are way too many powers that really doesn't affect the game and it just makes the game take longer than necessary.

Feels more like a clever set of mechanics than a game. I find the theme is meaningless with all the face-down cards. I also really tired of the gameplay, though maybe it was a larger player count (7 players) that hurt the game.

Awesome that it plays 8 and at a quick pace, although at 8 I wish it had more cards. I suggest using the rule of plot card hand limits based on the number of players: 5 cards
for 3 or 4 players, 4 cards for 5 players, and 3 cards for 6 to 8 players.

It's easy to play kill the leader in this game.

This is Coup on steroids. The jury is still out on it, we played it at the very end of an entire weekend of gaming, and late nights. I want to give it another chance as it seems interesting, but our first play was highly lackluster.

Part of the problem seems to be that in Coup the way to win is to directly eliminate the other players through accurately calling their bluffs. In Operation F.A.U.S.T. that's no longer the case. Now you buy art instead, but that means that the goal sort of shifts to keeping a low profile, and buying art enough to hopefully win before the other players notice.
